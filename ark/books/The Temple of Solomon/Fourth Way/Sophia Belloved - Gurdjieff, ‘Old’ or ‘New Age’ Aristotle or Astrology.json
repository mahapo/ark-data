[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies75Gurdjieff, ‘Old’ or ‘New Age’: Aristotle or Astrology?Sophia WellbelovedIn his written teachings, G.I. Gurdjieff (1866?-1949) uses two opposingmodes of defining the universe, humanity and their relation to each other,and thus sets up two conflicting sets of instructions for his reader. One set ofdefinitions is Gnostic, hierarchical and complex, in which ever more precisedefinitions are arrived at by the Aristotelian method of classifying things,people, and the world according to their differences. This method ofclassification answers questions such as, ‘What is special about this?’ and‘How is it separate from the mass of the all?’ The other mode whichGurdjieff uses is that of astrological correspondences, in which things aredefined by their similarity to others. This method leads to an ever wideningnet of likenesses and answers questions such as, ‘How is this thing like otherthings?’ and ‘How can it be joined to other things and approach closer to theall?’ His texts require the reader to make some reconciliation between thesetwo modes of defining and understanding himself and the world around him.This paper will outline the modes of definition and relate them briefly toGurdjieff’s references to the ‘Old Age’ theologies, philosophies and sciencesof the last two millennia and to the pre-Aristotelian and post-modern ‘NewAge’ modes of classification. It will show that while Gurdjieff’s texts seem toprovide a rigidly defined frame-work of cosmology and psychology, they arein fact paradoxical and anomalous. The multivalence of these texts reveal ateaching that is more ‘New Age’ than ‘Old’.G.I. Gurdjieff (1866?-1949) was born in Alexandropol of Greek andArmenian parents, travelled widely in the Middle and Far East, and returnedto Russia, arriving in Moscow in 1912. There he began to teach an occultcosmological and psychological ‘system’ of ideas. Leaving Russia becauseof the revolution, Gurdjieff travelled, via Tiblisi and Constantinople, toEurope, arriving in France in 1922, where he set up his ‘Institute For TheHarmonious Development Of Man’, attracting English and American pupils.He also gave his teaching in a form of sacred dances, and demonstrations ofthese were open to the public. During the 1920s Gurdjieff had a high profilein Paris and the reputation of a ‘mage’. He took his dancers to America in1924, but a near-fatal car accident on his return caused him to reassess hismode of teaching. Reducing the activity of the Institute, he began to put histeaching into a written form (see bibliography). He made nine or ten further"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies76visits to America establishing his teaching there and spent the World War IIyears teaching in Paris, where he died in 1949.1Gurdjieff’s texts and the readings from them formed an important part of histeaching. Their roots in Gurdjieff’s experience of the Turkic oral tradition ofhis childhood are shown in the way they were composed and also by the waythey were read aloud, not necessarily in sequence, and were sometimespreceded by music composed for the purpose by Gurdjieff and his pupilThomas de Hartmann (Wellbeloved 2002:27-31).In his teachings Gurdjieff uses two opposing modes of defining the universe,humanity and their relation to each other. In the first set of definitions man isdefined as separated from the above (the Absolute, the All or God), subject toinvolution – time, decay and death. These definitions answer questions aboutdifferences: What is special about this? How is it separate from the mass ofthe all? This Aristotelian mode of definition is the one stressed byGurdjieff’s pupil, P.D. Ouspensky, in his account of Gurdjieff’s teaching(Ouspensky 1987). However, Ouspensky notes, in some bafflement, thatGurdjieff also made use of stories and riddles, and elsewhere we findGurdjieff stressing that his cosmological ideas should not be taken literally(Ouspensky 1987:277; see also Wellbeloved 2003:216-17) .I will show that Gurdjieff’s second mode of defining humanity’s relation tothe universe is embedded in the zodiacal structure of his texts, within whichhumanity belongs in a universe in which the above and below, themacrocosm and microcosm are already inter-connected and theseconnections are defined by astrological correspondences. These second-modedefinitions answer questions about connectedness: How is this thing likeother things? How can it be joined to other things and become closer to theall?Both these sets of thinking have their origins in Mesopotamianastronomy/astrology of the pre-Christian era, but while the first, Aristotelianmode became mixed with Judaic millenarian thinking and was absorbed intothe Christian theological establishment where it is understood that time willcome to an end, the second, Mesopotamian thinking on interconnection andrecurring cycles of time was rejected by Christian theology. However, thisway of understanding the universe did not disappear but has remained inoccult teachings and as a common language of European culture for the pasttwo thousand years."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies77We will see that Gurdjieff incorporates both modes of definition in histeaching. The first, Aristotelian mode is related to the ‘precise’ languagewhich he says is needed by pupils and readers, in order to define themselvesand the universe. The second language is related to myth and symbol, whichare multivalent. Myths and symbols must not be defined in a fixed or finaldefinition. Gurdjieff requires both sets of language in order to express both‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ knowledge. He defines subjective knowledge asthat which we acquire via ordinary means of observation and scientificdeduction, belonging to the ‘subjective’, i.e. our ordinary everyday states ofconsciousness. This requires a ‘precise’ language. Objective knowledge isthat which is based upon ancient methods of observation and which is ‘aknowledge of the All’. It can be expressed via myth and symbol and can bereceived in a state which we may understand as higher than our everydaystate (Ouspensky 1987:278).1. Language: Gnostic SeparationGurdjieff’s cosmological and psychological teaching, as recounted byOuspensky, outlines a complex set of theories and includes Gurdjieff’steaching on the necessity for a precise language. This is justified on thegrounds that, in general, people do not understand one another: “[T]helanguage which people speak ... is full of wrong concepts, wrongclassifications, wrong associations” (Ouspensky 1987:68).Gurdjieff offers his own teaching terms as a way to introduce a universallanguage based on the principle of ‘relativity’, in which everything is definedin relation to the evolution possible to it. Thus man may belong to one ofseven levels, each having differing degrees of knowledge, understanding,materiality and life-span (Wellbeloved 2003:114-15). Gurdjieff’s cosmiclaws and his Pythagorean, Neo-Platonically derived Ray of Creation set outthe relation of man to universe, in which the higher is more unified andvaluable than the more dispersed lower. In Gnostic terms we are distantfrom the Absolute, the All or God, imprisoned in matter, helpless, lost, asleepand in need of messengers from above to awaken us. His cosmic, chemicaland psychological laws provide labyrinthine but apparently rigid theoreticalstructures within which we can make sense of ourselves, and through whichwe may hope to evolve, although in fact Gurdjieff’s teaching constantlysubverts this hope by re-defining our human condition in terms whichsuggest the impossibility of escape. This can make for a kind of snakes andladders game in which no pupil can rise more than a few squares up the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies78board before being sent sliding back down to the beginning (Wellbeloved2003:48-50).Gurdjieff seems to use the terminology of science. There are references tophysical, medical and psychological experiments in each of Gurdjieff’s texts,and also in the records of his group meetings during the Second World War.2He gives ‘friendly advice’ to the reader of the Beelzebub’s Tales To HisGrandson (Gurdjieff 1950) as the result of “numerous deductions andconclusions made by me during experimental elucidations concerning theproductivity of the perception by contemporary people of new impressionsfrom what is heard and read” (Gurdjieff 1950:vi). He asks his pupils to testthe results of their Work (as Gurdjieff’s teaching is known) through repeatedexperience, and stresses the necessity for a critical mind. “If you have not bynature a critical mind your staying here [at Gurdjieff’s Institute] is useless”(see Gurdjieff 1976:201, 275).In all this, as well as his insistence on ‘precise’ language, Gurdjieff appearsto be adhering to the notions of Aristotelian methods of classification bydifference as he defines his theory of cosmic levels, material density, speedsof vibrations, and the complex analysis of the digestion of food. However,much of this apparently scientific mode of teaching belongs to ‘occultscience’ a re-definition of the occult which arose after the Enlightenment.Where previously the teachings, unaccepted by established Christianity, hadbecome occult religions, these now became occult sciences. Occultteachings, the Work Foundations3 included, have since then tended to re-define themselves as psychologies or philosophies, and some are now, likethe Work, in the process of becoming traditions, returning, as it were, to areligious fold which had its origins in the pre-Christian era.Nonetheless, Gurdjieff’s texts show that he had a lively interest in andknowledge of the theory and experimental methods connected with scienceof his time, especially medicine, and in relation to this with narcotics. Hedemonstrates in the Tales (Gurdjieff 1950) his interest in electricity, and inMeetings with Remarkable Men (Gurdjieff 1978) his fascination withmechanical devices; ‘sewing-machines, typewriters, bicycles, gramophones,music-boxes, electric, photographic, medical and other apparatus; gas and oillamps’ are among the items which Gurdjieff writes that he undertook torepair in his ‘Universal Travelling Workshop’ (Gurdjieff 1978:255).However, whether it is occult or Aristotelian, the language of science is itselfsubject to change as the established ‘truths’ of one age are replaced by new"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies79understandings. Gurdjieff acknowledged that even his own ‘precise’universal language will be subject to time, and therefore to change. It willbecome incomprehensible for future generations, thus we have need ofanother form of language which will survive the destructive nature of time(Gurdjieff 1976:210-11).2. Myth and SymbolA second and opposing ‘language’ offered by Gurdjieff as an aid to ourawakening is that of myth and symbol, both of which can transmit ‘objectiveknowledge’, that is, the knowledge of the All.Realising the imperfection and weakness of ordinary language the peoplewho have possessed objective knowledge have tried to express the idea ofunity in ‘myths’ and ‘symbols’ (Ouspensky 1987:279).In Gurdjieff’s terminology our emotional and intellectual functioning arerepresented as ‘centres’ having higher and lower parts. The aim of myth is toenter the higher part of the emotional centre, while symbols are aimed at thehigher part of the intellectual centre. In these higher centres the ‘objective’truth would be free from the distortion and corruption of our attempts tounderstand from an ordinary everyday level of being.4Thus ordinary states of being are connected with the lower parts of ourcentres which function best with the ‘precise’ language which definesthrough separation; while the higher parts of centres, operating in non-ordinary states, can receive the ‘objective knowledge of the all’ contained inmyth and symbol.Gurdjieff specifically mentions magic, alchemy and astrology as symbolicmeans through which a knowledge of the all may be transmitted, but warns:a symbol can never be taken in a final and definite meaning. Inexpressing the laws of the unity of endless diversity a symbol itselfpossesses an endless number of aspects from which it can beexamined and it demands from a man approaching it the ability tosee it simultaneously from different points of view. Symbols whichare transposed into the words of ordinary language become rigid inthem, they grow dim and very easily become ‘their own opposites’... the cause of this is in the literal understanding of symbols, inattributing to a symbol a single meaning. (Ouspensky 1987:283-84)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies80The mode of definition common to astrology, alchemy and magic, is that ofastrological correspondence in which things are defined multivalently bysimilarities, their connectedness to the All: by which the above and below,the macrocosm and microcosm are inter-related.Gurdjieff disparaged contemporary thinking and appeared to agree with alate nineteenth century view of the Greeks as originators of a ‘rational’ modeof thinking which destroyed an earlier mode of ‘something akin to mythicalthinking based on the use of images’ (Kirk 1976:285-86; Welch 1982:79).Gurdjieff writes a section of Meetings in “a style called ‘the creation ofimages without words’” (Gurdjieff 1978:231-35).3. Science and ReligionThe Western European cultural history of astronomy/astrology from early inthe Christian era to our own time, has wrestled with the dichotomy betweenscience and religion, and this divide was re-enforced after the formalestablishment of Christianity. Although this is an extreme simplification,one branch of astronomy/astrology aimed at precise measurement andcalculation required by science (Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo), and theother, ‘religious’ side of astrology focused on the myth and symbolism of thezodiacal gods and on astrological correspondences (Pythagoras, Neo-Platonists, Theosophists, Jung). At its most rigid, astrology determined themechanistic fate of a person’s entire lifespan against which there was nooption of change, whilst magical arts used astrological charts (elections),correspondences, and house symbolism to form talismans and spells whichsought an amelioration or escape from fate (Garin 1990:xi-xiii). Both theseaspects of astrology remained entwined until after the Enlightenment, andboth strands of thinking are discernable in Gurdjieff’s teaching: the‘mechanistic’ fixed fate of man as he is, and the hope of freedom from thatfate via the evolutionary path that he teaches.The history of astronomy/astrology in the West shows something of how thetwo kinds of language Gurdjieff refers to came about. While the ‘scientific’side with its ‘precise’ language has been gradually privileged by the West,the religious side, stemming from Eastern myth and numerology, hasremained present in occult teachings and also in Christianity, because,although Christianity rejected the practise of judicial astrology it retained itsmyth and number symbolism. These are incorporated into paintings,architecture and, most relevantly for our enquiry, in the structure of textsboth sacred and secular."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies81Gurdjieff echoed Blavatsky’s aim to bring the science of the West and thereligion of the East together, and one way to understand his approach to thisis through his distinction between the kinds of languages he used.54. Numerological and Astrological Structuring of textsMesopotamian number symbolism is found in the Hebrew scriptures.Number symbolism was used by Philo Judaeus (c 30BC-50AD) as a tool tohelp find some reconciliation between conflicting Judaic and Platoniccosmologies. “Biblical exegesis influenced St Augustine who gave anumerological structure to his Civitas Dei and to the Christian Fathers whoused number symbolism to interpret and inter-relate the Old and NewTestaments” (see Butler 1970:22-4, 27-8). Structuring texts according tonumber symbolism remained a common practice as late as the eighteenthcentury. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Blavatsky’sTheosophical cosmology, astrology and numerology helped to further aninterest in zodiacally structured texts. Theosophical astrologers interpretedBiblical and Greek myths and Archaic Epics in terms of zodiacal patterns,and this interest extended to Modernist writers, for example Joyce (1922;1939) and Yeats (1937).Elsewhere I have outlined the astrological origins of Gurdjieff’scosmological Laws of Three and Seven in the three modes and seven planetsof the zodiac, zodiacal structure, his use of astrological correspondences inthe Tales, and his use of the zodiac as a source of myth and symbol(Wellbeloved 2002:35-76).65. Gurdjieff’s TextsAll of Gurdjieff’s four texts, including The Herald of Coming Good(Gurdjieff 1988), are myths which enshrine his cosmic and psychologicalteachings in a fictional form, and which, if we regard them in accordancewith his own teaching on myth, are offered to some higher part of ouremotional centre and thus beyond the interpretation which would give rise toany final or closed reading.The Tales (Gurdjieff 1950) is a myth that subverts the myths of WesternEurope, and among them the Biblical myths of Creation, Fall, Redemptionand Revelation; the myth of Atlantis; the myth of the supremacy of ClassicalGreece, with its scientific and philosophical achievements; the esoteric andoccult teachings, as well as the received understanding of the teachings of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies82Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, (the teachers of the religiousTraditions are not themselves derided in the text); and the modern myths ofEnlightenment and industrialisation, Marxism and Darwinian evolution,notions of ‘progress’ via contemporary science, medicine or education. Wemight understand some of these myths to have become lodged in the lowerpart of centres and therefore to have had any true meaning corrupted. TheTales is structured as a forward moving zodiac, that is, from Aries to Pisces,through the ordinary flow of the year. Time is shown in its involutionary anddestructive flow from the unity of the all to the diversity of the many (seeWellbeloved 2002).In Meetings (Gurdjieff 1978), Gurdjieff creates a myth of his own life storyin which the many, his group of friends, become unified into one, abrotherhood of Seekers with a single aim. In his teaching Gurdjieff used theterm ‘Philadelphia’, the city of brotherly love, as the necessary destinationfor all pupils. There are many references in this text to Gurdjieff’s brotherlyfeelings and to ancient brotherhoods.This text is also structured as a zodiac. However, unlike the Tales it movesbackwards from Aquarius via Capricorn to Pisces (contrary to the flow of theyear). A person who travels through the zodiac is subject to time andtherefore involution and death. However, if he reverses his direction andmoves backwards through the zodiac against time he is on an evolutionarypath.7 The narrative of Meetings shows the Seekers relation to time in thatthey are travelling back away from their contemporary culture, towardsancient cultures, texts and teachings. The past is represented as a higheridealised place, an origin or Paradise which they strive to re-enter. We canunderstand this myth as directed to the higher part of the emotional centre.Gurdjieff suggests this in his appreciation of the Thousand and One Nights inthe Introduction to Meetings:anyone hearing or reading this book feels clearly that everything in itis fantasy, but fantasy corresponding to truth, even though composedof episodes which are quite improbable for the ordinary life ofpeople. The interest of the reader or listener is awakened and,enchanted by the author’s fine understanding of the psyche of peopleof all walks of life round him, he follows with curiosity how, little bylittle, a whole story is formed out of these small incidents of actuallife. (Gurdjieff 1978:18)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies83In Life (Gurdjief 1991), Gurdjieff creates a myth, often accepted as a trueautobiographical account of events in his life in New York in the early1930s. Paul Taylor has shown that of the events Gurdjieff records some tookplace as described, while others took place but on different dates, and somenever took place at all (Taylor 2001:167-172).8 In this myth, Gurdjieff hasevolved to a place where he is free of the constraints of time; the text takesplace in the ‘real’ or eternal present where ‘I am’ is a defeat of time.Herald (Gurdjieff 1988), the text which Gurdjieff ‘exiled’ and forbad hispupils to read, is a myth of ruin and exile, in which the exile of the bookechoes the exile of Satan from Heaven, or Beelzebub from the Sun Absolute.It shows a myth of Gurdjieff as an occult magician, corrupted by time andsubject to devolution and degeneration in which he wishes to cause ‘lastingsuffering’ to former pupils alive and dead (Gurdjieff 1988:76).We can see that in the Tales (Gurdjieff 1950) and Herald (Gurdjieff 1988),time divides and separates – the movement is involutional from the one to themany; while in Meetings (Gurdjieff 1978) and Life (Gurdjieff 1991), loveunifies and joins – the movement is evolutional from the many to the one. Inthe Tales (Gurdjieff 1950), Gurdjieff defines love and time as unlike anyother forces in the universe; they are alone in having no separate place oftheir arising, and are present everywhere.Time alone ... has no source from which its arising should depend,but like Divine-Love flows always, ... independently by itself, andblends proportionately with all the phenomena present in a givenplace. (Gurdjieff 1950:124)We can connect the destructive element of time with the ‘precise’ languagewhich will corrupt and become meaningless, and the creative force of lovewith the incorruptible language of myth and symbol.6. Reading Gurdjieff’s textsAs readers we may ask whether it is possible to separate everyday precisedefinitions required by the lower centres from the myth method of a non-interpretative grasping of the All required for the higher centres? We alsoneed to ask how these two approaches to understanding can be related toGurdjieff’s instructions on how to read his texts."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies84At first, it might seem that the ‘myth method’ of not interpreting the textwould be the one for us to adopt as readers, and this is the approach taken bythe Gurdjieff Foundations. However, this does not accord with Gurdjieff’sinstructions to his reader. Gurdjieff requires us to read his books, firstly aswe would usually read a ‘contemporary book or newspaper’, secondly asthough aloud to another person, and only later, in the third reading, to ‘try tofathom the gist’ of what he is saying (Gurdjieff 1950:vi) . If we attempt toread the Tales (Gurdjieff 1950) like this we will find that the advice provesimpossible to follow. Gurdjieff’s long, complex syntax demands closeattention; we cannot read it as we read books and newspapers, because it isnot written the way books and newspapers are written. Unless we try tomake some sense of the multiple clauses we are not reading at all, merelyletting words pass in front of our eyes. Thus, before we reach the secondrequired mode of reading we are already involved in the third. As readers wemay embark on this journey in a spirit of enquiry, but Gurdjieff’s complexityof language and ideas calls for considerable investment of time and effort.The longer we stay trying to understand him, the further we becomeentangled in and confused by his texts. Gurdjieff’s apparently simpleinstruction proves deceptive, and echoes the paradox of his practical teachingwhich demands that pupils must make efforts to work on themselves, tostruggle to awaken, even though they are machines and have no ‘will’, nocentral ‘I’ to work on, and no ability ‘to do’.7. The Karatasian language of the TalesWe can recognise Gurdjieff’s cosmic and psychological teachings, originallygiven in an oral form and expressed in the apparently ‘precise’ language, ineach of his texts. However, these are made more complex, and less easilygrasped in the Tales (Gurdjieff 1950) by his use of ‘Karatasian’, the languageof Beelzebub’s home planet. Thus the Law of Three becomes the Law ofTriamazikamno; the Law of Seven, the Law of Heptaparaparshinokh. Asreaders we must retain some knowledge of Karatasianin order to negotiatethe text, and as there is no glossary, and Gurdjieff only defines words once,we need to take notes of the vocabulary. Some Karatasian words suggestpossible English and/or other earth language sources and possibleinterpretations, but they also seem to provide a subversion of the exactlanguage Gurdjieff has earlier demanded. The mode in which Beelzebubinstructs Hassein on these laws is also more dense and complex than that inwhich Gurdjieff instructs his pupils."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies85Gurdjieff uses other strategies within the narrative: contradictions,inconsistencies, deceptions and humour. These ensure multivalence andmake it impossible to have closure, that is, any ‘precise’ definition whichwould destroy the ‘objective truth’ they contain (Wellbeloved 2002:77-83).On the other hand, as shown above, it is not possible to read the texts orlisten to them being read without any sense of meaning at all, i.e. to acceptthe texts as meaningless to all but the higher part of the emotional centre.Gurdjieff demands a great deal of his reader who needs to have someknowledge of the commonly held Biblical, scientific and religious and othermyths on which he drew. If we cannot recognise the references he makes tothese origins we will be unable to understand his commentary on them. Thereader is left to work out how to make a reconciliation between the twolanguages Gurdjieff uses, the ‘precise’ and the ‘mythic’.8. ConclusionsDespite Gurdjieff’s patriarchal tone, apparent or actual misogyny,authoritarian mode of teaching, and admiration of political and spiritualhierarchies; and despite the apparently Aristotelian precision defining hiscomplex ideas, his demand for logical reasoning from pupils, and his owninterest in contemporary science, technology and medicine; nevertheless,much of the material which Gurdjieff draws on comes from the sameunderground, subversive occult teachings as those which ‘New Age’practices are exploring and re-expressing within our culture. These includeastrology, alchemy, Kabala and forms of magic and healing. In all of thesethe fundamental language employed to connect microcosm and macrocosm isthat of astrological correspondence.Gurdjieff’s texts are a critique of the modern, expressing complex laws andsets of information, but also enshrining eternal verities, primarily, love’sdefeat of time. This is, in essence, the Christian myth where, by the sacrificeof his own life, and through the power of his love for humanity, Christredeems time and conquers death. However, this myth has its origin in earliertimes. Gurdjieff reaches back to Mesopotamian astronomy/astrology and toearly Greek number symbolism and myth representing a pre-Greek rationaland pre-Christian Western European culture; he also reaches forward into apost-Einsteinian, post-First World War culture, and its willingness toquestion Christianity, long Europe’s central social, moral and politicalpower, and to question also Enlightenment science and the supremacy ofrational thinking.
