I warn you that what you are going to read about the Tarot will com­pletely change your thinking about the Tarot and your use of the Tarot deck. Most people don't like change, and few people are really \"wide awake\" to accept revolution. Most of us-including myself­are not always truly awake, and rarely do we welcome change even when pretending that we do. We want our comfort, we prefer consis­tency, and we honor tradition while yearning for the simpler times of the \"Good Olde Days.\" Real revolutions are evolutionary, and, when involved with eso­teric and spiritual concepts, their essential function is to wake us up, expand our consciousness, and open doors we didn't see that were there all the time. The difference between revolution and evolution is that one hap­pens to you and the other requires you to take the \"next step\" to ac­complish the change in your reality. Evolution builds upon the past, but the change in your reality is transformative, and even the past XV"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"XVI FOREWORD looks different from your new perspective and place of understand­ing. The Tarot is key to this revolutionary evolution. In this book, Jean-Louis de Biasi tells us that the Tarot was cre­ated to invoke specific invisible forces that generate energies present both within us and at universal levels. Each card represents a state of consciousness and a particular energy that can be invoked and used in ritual and divination as keys to the most ancient archetypes. Jean­Louis writes: \"The Tarot induces an action on the subtle planes that is capable of affecting our invisible bodies, and then reverberating into the physical level in our daily lives.\" He further writes that the \"Tarot was conceived to transmit a secret initiatic inheritance by channeling specific invisible powers and stimulating energies present inside of you that are extant in the entire universe,\" and that the Tarot's \"con­struction is based on an occult structure that makes each Arcanum a genuine talisman, which is able, merely by its presence, to generate those effects to which it corresponds:' However, Jean-Louis does warn the reader that most versions of the Tarot are not completely effective in connecting us with these full powers, and he explains why and re­veals the answer to the problem. What you already see is that this divine Tarot is a long way from \"the devil's picture book\" or the simple art form of the Italian Re­naissance. We don't have the \"fortune-telling\" decks that were so entertaining in Victorian times and we have much more than even promised by the modern magical orders. The Tarot is a system, not a \"thing,\" and as such the Tarot stands alone and independent to fulfill its purpose of providing an inner ex­perience of contacting the divine powers and incorporating them into your own psyche, fostering your psychic development and empower­ment. You will then be able to use these powers in solving personal life problems by taking action on the invisible planes. By understanding the secret origins of Tarot symbolism, the reader becomes directly involved with the nearly alchemical process of transformation that is itself the secret of initiation.

The Theurgic Tradition is continued to this day in the Ogdoadic Tradition of the Aurum Solis. It is within that ancient tradition, reaching back to the origins of the Tarot, that we correct the errors found in the Waite-Colman deck and other modern decks, that we find the original correspondences of the sacred Greek letters, see the original Qabalistic correspondences to the sacred Hebrew letters, perceive the archetypal relationships with the Greek divinities, and rediscover the sacred names corresponding to these divine powers. Building upon these revolutionary/evolutionary foundations, this book takes the reader well beyond the limitations of ordinary Tarot practices of divination and even of talismanic and ritual magic. Through these uses and active meditation, we are in astral and mental contact with the invisible living spirit, or Angel of the Tarot, that has existed now for thousands of years. It is with the system of the Tarot, and interaction with this angel, that the divine Tarot becomes a complete initiatory experience. We are not limited to just the physical reality; the Tarot enables a true link and a reciprocal exchange between the physical and the non­physical, between our mind and the spiritual world. Through our subtle bodies, the Tarot system makes it possible to enter directly into a relationship with different levels of reality. Thought forms are cre­ated of astral substance and then function to connect us with other entities and energies that empower our further evolutionary growth and development. Seeing the Tarot as a genuine symbolic summary of the divine powers at work throughout the cosmos, we enter into new relations and responsibilities as conscious co-creators, knowing that every thought and action has consequences beyond our personal sphere. Even our divination becomes more than interpretation, opening an interactive channel to influence the outcome of the reading."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"XVIII FOREWORD We can go further and use the Tarot cards as astral doorways to travel out-of-body, experience new realities, and to become more than we are!

The familar history of the Tarot closely associates myth and reality in order to constitute a unique example of a popular work con­cealing an incomparable treasure. Several authors have shown that the group of arcana in the Tarot deck constitutes a true symbolic synthesis of the Western initiatic tra­dition. Of course, there are many books about spiritual and esoteric teachings, but the Tarot offers you the amazing testimony of what al­chemists called the Mutus Liber, a \"mute book!' It is not necessary to know the meanings of each of the Tarot ar­cana in order to feel a stirring of exceptional interest in this creation. Even though their original denotations appear to have been lost, the lore of each of the Tarot cards will be revealed directly from the pages of this venerable book. The Tarot emanates a kind of magical charm that you can feel as soon as you begin using it. You somehow perceive that another reality exists behind these visual representations. With­out really being able to define or understand it, your intuition urges 1"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2 INTRODUCTION you that a greater mystery, a hidden tradition, is to be found behind these icons. Today, the Tarot is principally used for divination. Initially, the Tarot deck was used to play simple card games and then later became quite popular as a fortune-telling device. Although I have not yet en­tirely revealed the foundations of divination, it is easily possible to use the Tarot for this purpose. On the other hand, it would be very interesting to delve into this subject more deeply and take the first steps on the path of the initiation of the Tarot. To do this, you must ask yourself what is the real purpose of the Tarot and how it can be used as a tool for initiation. The answer to both of those questions may surprise you: the Tarot allows you to receive a genuine initiation because the Tarot is a living being! The Tarot was created to invoke specific invisible forces, to gener­ate energies present both within you (the microcosm) and at univer­sal levels (the macrocosm). Each Tarot card, or Arcanum, represents a state of consciousness and a particular energy, which can be in­voked and used in a ritual. The Tarot keys that you use in divination are also talismans, which are connected to the most ancient arche­types; the Tarot Arcana are symbols that can generate specific states of consciousness. The Tarot induces an action on the subtle planes that is capable of affecting our invisible bodies, and then reverberating into the physical level in our daily lives. As you will see in this book, the Tarot was conceived to transmit a secret initiatic inheritance by channeling specific invisible powers and stimulating energies inside of you that are also extant in the entire universe. Each of these Arcana corresponds to a specific state of con­sciousness and to a particular energy associated with that state. The Tarot's construction is based on an occult structure that makes each Arcanum a genuine talisman, which is able, merely by its presence, to generate those effects to which it corresponds. However, it is important to note that the classical symbols gener­ally available as the Tarot of Marseille or other similar versions of the Tarot limit the energy that you, as theurgists, can readily access and II use to change reality.

The divine Arcana created in the Renaissance by the initiates of the Hermetic and Ogdoadic Tradition (which ex­ists today as Aurum Solis) helps you to connect, in a better and more precise manner, to these powers. Today, it is important to reveal this heritage and to explain how to use this important theurgic tool. You know that in the Western Tradition there are particular moments in history during which the revelation of certain parts of our tradition is made necessary by the circumstances facing society. Such is most decidedly the case today! This book was conceived from a perspective that the crises facing modern society require making you aware of several unique aspects related to the use of the Tarot. For the first time, I will reveal the identity of the initiates who were present at the origin of the Tarot, as well as what their goals and intentions were in creating this \"mute book.\" Secondly, I will show you how to have an inner experience of the Tarot, in a way that is not merely intellectual. This method will allow you to contact the divine powers governing the Tarot and to incorpo­rate them, step by step, into your psyche. In this way, you will discover a very efficient means of creating balance and harmony, which can be effective in fostering a genuine development of your awareness and well-being. Once this is accomplished, you will then be able to use the power of the Arcana to succeed in finding a solution to the problems of your life. You will undoubtedly be surprised at the effectiveness of these actions. The Ritual of the Birthday, which I will demonstrate later in the book, is an example of the unsuspected possibilities of the Tarot. Since the proper use of the Tarot makes it possible for you to take action on the invisible planes, you will next learn how to use the sci­ence of magic at a distance. When you discover the true nature of the Tarot, you will be taking your first steps on the path of the initiate; this path takes you step by step toward the highest levels of spiritual awakening. Once you un­derstand the nature and function of these Tarot keys, you will be able to use their divine energies on both the visible and invisible planes."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"r ' i PARTONl: THl: DIVINl: Hl:RIT�Gl:"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"i t , 1\\ LIVING Bl:ING The Tarot is a living being! It has its own intelligence, a personality you can feel every time you use the Tarot. When you take the Tarot cards in your hands, you do not hold an impotent document or an inanimate book. The Arcana of the Tarot are a real tool that allows you to invoke or evoke an immaterial and invisible mind. These Tarot cards are the visible appearance of an invisible form of consciousness that can communicate with you through the medium of the Tarot deck. By way of analogy, if you think of the photograph of a person, you un­derstand that the photograph is a representation of a person, not the person him-or herself. In this example, this photograph does not have a real and immediate relationship with the person it represents. The photograph merely evokes our memories and helps focus our minds on the person so pictured, even if that person is located miles away. If you were trying to get an impression of someone you had never met, then several photos taken at different moments in that person's his­tory would undoubtedly give you a more precise impression of that per­son. However, you would certainly agree that this kind of impression is 7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8 A LIVING BEING not a real link to the person represented in the photos, but just symbols of him or her. Here's another example. A telephone allows you to speak with someone who may be far away, even if you have never met him or her before. This telephone offers you a real link to this specific person, whether you have had contact with him or her before or not. The Tarot is similar to both of these examples. As in the first in­stance of tht; photograph, the Tarot is a symbolic representation of powers that are normally distant from and invisible to you (just as a photograph is a symbolic representation of someone who is at a distance or you cannot currently see) and, as in the second case, the Tarot permits you to establish a direct and genuine link with these divine powers. The esoteric traditions do not limit a mind and a being to only one physical dimension. Esoteric traditions recognize that the Tarot establishes a true link and a reciprocal exchange between the mate­rial and immaterial substances, between the physical mind and the spiritual world. Your subtle bodies are an expression of this principle and they make it possible to enter directly into a relationship with the different levels of reality. Your mind can create thought forms in the astral dimension, both positive or negative. In order to comprehend how these energies operate, you must begin by understanding the process that has led to the revelation of and contact with these divinities and the Spirit (Angel) of the Tarot. As you will see in this book, the initiates of antiquity wanted to synthesize their understanding of the universe in the Tarot cards. In­deed, the Tarot is a symbolic but real summary of the divine powers at work in the cosmos. To the ancients, our being (which is called the \"microcosm\") is a representation of the cosmos (which is called the \"macrocosm\"), while at the same time our being is also a real part of the macrocosm. That means that you affect the environment that sur­rounds your body, but you also have an impact on the deepest parts of your being. It is from this understanding of how the cosmos oper­ates that the Theory of the Signatures (which is also called \"sigillum\") was developed. It is possible to summarize this theory here by saying A� that all the elements that co are interconnected, and each you may recognize it. Thus, with the sun and with a p of the color yellow.

Thus, a yellow plant will have a relationship with the sun and with a physical ailment such as jaundice because of the color yellow. The Law of Correspondences is derived from this ancient theory. It is a statement of the existence of invisible links be­tween symbols or colors (for example) and states of consciousness. Thus, each Tarot Arcanum represents invisible divine realities. The use of an Arcanum helps you to create a direct link between your­self and this divine power. All these correspondences are rooted in the most authentic Western traditions. As the legend of the Tarot explains, there is no doubt that the Tarot was created by initiates in order to transmit their arcane knowledge. The Tarot encompasses a teaching that is at the same time spiritual and religious, but also includes teachings on divination. It is for this reason that the Catholic Church continues to fight what they con­sider to be suspect esoteric divinatory traditions, and (even worse in their eyes) what they consider to be suspect magical or theurgic invo­cations of the ancient divine powers, as each Arcanum was thought to be a talisman-a representation that was codified with and which embodied a very dangerous form of ancient philosophy or theology. In the modern world, the Tarot has lost much of the impact it once had as a divinatory instrument that allows you to look into the future and see what will happen. How could something as insignifi­cant as a deck of playing cards be treated with such suspicion? What is the hidden knowledge that it holds? Is it true that these Arcanum can be used as talismans, and are they really a means by which you can invoke some ancient and hidden divine power? Are there any connec­tions between the Tarot and the ancient mysteries? Is there any occult \"deck\" that is more authentic and potent, a deck that is easier to use as a genuine theurgic tool? Who invented this arcane deck? Who were these initiates that were considered enemies by the Church in both the Eastern and Western world?

Some of the most important esoteric principles and practices were brought into Egypt, where they became associated with the magical knowledge of the early Egyptians. Via the ancient Egyptians, magical knowledge became an integral part of Mediterranean heritage. From the beginning of Egyptian civilization, religion and magic have been deeply linked with the most ancient divinities. The God Thoth and the Goddess Isis were viewed as the founders of the divine magic transmitted to Egypt. Their presence and the power of their cults became one of the most important and ancient traditions in the world. However, you must make a clear distinction between the reli­gious beliefs and profane magical practices of the common Egyptians and the esoteric birth of the Theurgic Tradition around this period. 11"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"12 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS Clear evidence of this distinction appears in various period books such as the Poimandres (Shepherd of Men, author unknown) and The Mysteries of Egypt by Iamblicus. It was at this time in history that this remarkable lineage of mas­ters and initiates was born, educated, and initiated. They became the living incarnation of these initiatic mysteries, and they constituted the true visible founders of this tradition. This initiatic line is also known in philosophical writings by the names \"Platonism\" and \"Neopla­tonism:' On the inner level, this Golden Chain of the Masters was the vehicle of theurgic knowledge for the Hermetic Tradition, or simply called \"Hermeticism:' The writings of the masters of this time, such as Proclus, Plotinus, and Iamblicus to name but a few, demonstrate this concept very well. Without developing the theurgic aspect any further, it is impor­tant to understand what the Hermetic Tradition is. It is an initiatic, philosophical, and religious tradition that emerged and evolved dur­ing the Ptolemaic period of Egypt, at the end of the Egyptian empire. Alexandria had become an extraordinary place at this time in history; a cultural, religious, and initiatic melting pot. This mixing of varying families of spirits was the basis for the myths and the history of the texts later termed the Hermetica (the Hermetic texts). More precisely, this ancient amalgamation was the foundation for the famous Em­erald Tablet. Throughout the history of the Hermetic Tradition, this current has always remained autonomous, even against the political and religious powers that emerged over the course of history, and all the more so against the persecutive sects such as Catholicism. Her­meticism evolved and gathered strength over the centuries; it became a family of people who were eager to work at overtaking all forms of extremism and all forms of dualism. It was always characterized by an openness and flexibility that permitted it to include and encom­pass many spiritual paths, as long as they were not exclusive in nature. Every sincere individual who had the desire to progress on the way of the knowledge of the sacred and the divine was benevolently wel­comed and could ask to be initiated.

As you can see, the spirit that eventually constituted Hermeticism and assured its durability is an enduring desire to use reason, keen­ness, and determination to exceed usual personal limits for the pur­pose of making progress toward the direction of the divine planes. This was what Pletho called \"the sacred Way of Return.\" In spite of the loss over time of very important texts, true philosophical corpus still exists. There are several categories of these Hermetic writings. Those writings that are most typically Hermetic are primarily found in the Corpus Hermeticum (a group of texts attributed to Hermes) and in the other texts that are collected in a volume as the Chaldaic Oracles. In addition to these two works, there are also various theological and philosophical treatises. Of course, the books and oral lessons of Plato constitute the philosophical basis of this tradition, including Orphism and Pythagorism. Plato's students became the successors to Hermeti­cism and continued this teaching, codifying, balancing, and uniting this philosophy and system of spirituality into a complete system. This Neoplatonic form of Hermeticism is called Religio Mentis (Reli­gion of the Mind). The practice of philosophy became an active part of the philosopher's spiritual life, a true search for the divine. With this approach to philosophy, the Neoplatonic and Hermetic philoso­phers made an amalgam of the initiation rites into the ancient mys­teries that were received from the Egyptian circles of Alexandria. You must remember that the Greeks of antiquity were aware of something called the \"Cults of the Mysteries;' and these cults were very different from the popular religious practices that are better known, just as the ancient Greek religious practices are very different from the dogmatic religions that were formed out of the biblical perspective. In ancient Greece, the schools of mysteries developed into different branches; these are the first true \"initiations.\" Included in this grouping are the Mysteries of Eleusis, of Bacchus, of Sarnothrace, and others. The term \"mystery\" derives from the Latin mysterium, which came from the Greek musterion, meaning in this context \"a secret rite or doctrine.\" An"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"14 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS individual who followed such a \"mystery\" was a Mystes, that is, \"one who has been initiated.\" Some of these initiatic mysteries were strongly connected to phil­osophical schools, such as the Platonist Academia in Athens, which later evolved into the Neoplatonic Tradition. These mysteries were always inspired from and in harmony with the traditional cults that were devoted to the many pagan Gods and Goddesses, and they were the esoteric aspect of these deities' popular rites and beliefs. These \"mysteries\" transmitted a hidden esoteric knowledge to a limited number of individuals. Initiates were generally chosen for their moral qualities and their genuine desire. These initiates were bound by oaths that required them to be silent about their knowl­edge, not to reveal what they had learned and where they learned it. This was true of the Neoplatonic schools as well. Clement of Alex­andria wrote: \"Not only Pythagoreans and Plato keep most of their dogmas hidden, but the Epicureans themselves confess that they re­tain their secrets and that they do not permit the books where these secrets are displayed to be handled by very many others\" (Stromates, V, 9). Proclus claimed that \"Plato used mathematical names as veils of the truth of things; in the same way that theologians use myths and the Pythagoreans used symbols\" (Comments on Time, 36b ). Thus, the Hermetic path integrated the process of the mysteries and the initiations that constituted them. Hermeticism includes some revealed texts that were transmitted and interpreted by a \"master\" to some carefully prepared disciples. The earlier referenced large trea­tises, such as the Corpus Hermeticum, constitute the Supreme Gnosis, which is the esoteric science of assuring salvation. The formulation of the mystery rites is one of the most important esoteric heritages from this period. The Greek initiatic traditions ef­fectively combined the sacred mysteries with the rationalism of phi­losophy, which constituted the real genius of this esoteric tradition. For the ancient Greeks, Egypt was always considered as the mother country for the most ancient secrets and magic. It was between the second century BCE and the sixth century CE that this union between the philosophical and initiatic aspects was accomplished. THE GOLD� dria.

This occurred during the period of Egyptian history known as the Ptolemaic period. The Greek initiates brought the Greek initiatic system of the mysteries with them to Alexandria and this was incor­porated into the religion of the Egyptian priests, yielding a new, co­herent structure from the ancient Egyptian traditions. This was the real birth of the Hermetic Tradition, later to be known as the Ogdo­adic Tradition, or Ordo Aurum Solis. One of the aspects of, and one of the most important conse­quences of, the Hermetic belief is the refusal to divide knowledge into opposing parts. The God Hermes guides every initiate toward the unification of internal opposites, resulting in openness to others, as well as the ability to be accepting of and welcoming toward others with characteristics that differ from our own. In the words of Pletho, \"All religions are but pieces of the broken mirror of Aphrodite.\" Her­meticism is the intuitive solution to the unity with divinity that every philosopher and initiate is looking for. Yet the Hermeticist must bear in mind that the definition of \"divinity;' which is above the mutable forms of this world, is impossible to explain with simple words. Every initiate knows that the critical judgment of others and a dogmatic ap­proach to life are in opposition to this balance. It is for this reason that Hermeticism is so viable and current in our modern era . DARK DAYS AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE TRADITION You are all well aware that there have been various totalitarian organi­zations in the history of the world. Religion was a primary example of a contradictory union between the spiritual and the political. Around the third century CE, Catholicism emerged as an increasingly power­ful political entity, which eclipsed the Roman Empire in its last days. The Catholic dogmatic vision of the world included a unique and unquestionable divine principle, which caused the Catholic Church to identify its adversaries so that such enemies could be eliminated. The initiates of the sacred mysteries, the philosophers and theurgists"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"16 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS who transmitted the secrets of communication with the divine pow­ers were prosecuted and often persecuted. Flavius Claudius Julian us, commonly known as Julian, became the Roman emperor during the fourth century CE. Julian tried in vain to reverse this Catholic-driven persecution and to help the initiatic traditions and the sacred cults. In 363 CE, Julian died from wounds he received in the Battle of Samarra. Many Catholics rejoiced, later claiming that Julian did not die from his wounds but was instead as­sassinated by one of his Christian soldiers as retribution for Julian's shielding of pagan traditions. The Neoplatonic and Hermetic philosophical schools were, once again, singled out for attack in the form of opposition and intimida­tion. During the Council of Nicaea, Emperor Constantine declared that the Orthodox (Catholic) religion was the mandatory (and only permitted) religion that would henceforth be allowed throughout the Roman Empire. The stated intention of the Nicene Council was to de­stroy every religious and philosophical tradition that existed prior to the advent of Christianity. This deliberate attack on pagans and their belief systems did not just take the form of a few theological rules that would be understood and used by certain scholars and religious clerics. Instead, the council's laws constituted mandatory injunctions, which carried severe penalties and directly affected the private lives of every person. Earlier, in 353 CE, Emperor Constanius II had given the order to close all \"pagan\" temples, but it was in the fifth century that Emperor Justinian carried out these orders. It is clear that, from the beginning, the primary goal of the Catholic Church was to annihilate paganism; to eradicate it from public and private life; and to censor all of the creative domains where it might find a foothold (such as books, art, etc.). As a result, an untold number of initiated (both women and men) were captured, tortured, and killed by \"pure Christian love.\" These brutal and deadly attacks by Church officials necessitated that the ini­tiates of the old religions shroud the beliefs and rituals of the Her­metic Tradition in secrecy.

Over time, this habit of being clandestine became entrenched. The knowledge that was required for initiation was preserved as a secret, and those secrets were reserved for transmission to the most trustworthy of followers. In this way, a rich and valuable tradition has been passed down through the ages, and continues to be a viable and potent force today in the Ordo Aurum Solis. In this book we will not be examining the intervening epochs be­tween then and now. It is enough to mention that the Hermetic and Ogdoadic mysteries were principally handed down during this pe­riod throughout the same geographical zone that was dominated by the \"Church of the East:' the Eastern Orthodox Church, centered in Byzantium (later called Constantinople).

This star's enduring na­ture offers good evidence of the presence and the permanence of this theurgic tradition. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church1 reigned supreme over the minds of the people, tyrannically imposing its dog­mas and pursuing all manner of heresy. Every kind of cult, worship, wisdom, or science not sanctioned by the Church was considered to be heretical. The only permissible faith, the only legal and valid foun­dation, was the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. All forms of traditional initiations, divination, magic, or theurgy were considered to be sorcery or witchcraft. Remember that the meaning of these terms has changed considerably today.

The most dangerous people to the Catholic religious power were (of course) the scholars and initiates, who worked to trans­mit the ancient heritage they received from their predecessors. PLETHO, THE HERMETIC MASTER At the end of the fourteenth century CE, a man was born who would secretly run this tradition and whose efforts allowed it to continue to exist throughout the centuries to come, transforming the totality of Western Catholicism. His name was Gemistus Pletho. Pletho was born in 1360 in Constantinople into an Orthodox sac­erdotal family. He received a complete classical education. At the end of his childhood, Pletho left the city of his birth for unknown rea­sons, seeking safety in Andrinople, then capital of the Ottoman Em­pire. During this period, he frequently met with a very influential Jew named Elisha, who was initiated into the occult sciences. Later, Elisha was condemned in the courts of the Inquisition and burned alive. It may have been after this episode that Pletho returned to Con­stantinople, where he began to have an impressive reputation as a professor and scholar. But the Church, anxious about the content of his lessons, attempted to have him barred from teaching. By 1407, the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologos had sent Pletho to Mistra, a city close to ancient Sparta, in the south of Greece. Pletho became the counselor of Theodore II, a young political chief of Mistra. It was in Mistra that Pletho founded and developed what he called his \"sib­lings\" or \"spiritual family.\" This was the group that would ultimately have an important role in the development of Neoplatonism in the West. Among its followers I should mention the name of Bessarion, about whom I will speak more later. Around the year 1420, Pletho became the chief of the Neoplatonic and Hermetic schools I had earlier discussed. The chiefs and theolo­gians of the Eastern Church admitted that Pletho was a real scholar who was erudite in theological knowledge. It even became necessary for them to ask for Pleto's help at times, although, for many of them, his religious opinions were suspect."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"20 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS In 1439, Cosimo de' Medici, then political chief of Florence (a city in the region of Tuscany in Italy), invited to his city a council that tried to unite the Eastern and Western Churches. Pletho was among the Greeks who were invited. Pletho was not part of the monks and their religious group, but he was invited as an erudite layman and scholar. Pletho was well versed in both the Catholic and Greek clas­sical traditions, and to this he added the presence and permanence of Platonic philosophy, which were capable of undoing the theologi­cal subtleties in which the Catholic theologians had locked themselves and their people. However, Pletho's objective was very different than the council's. During his stay in Florence, Pletho was regularly received by Cosimo de' Medici, where he conducted many philosophical debates. At the instigation of Cosimo, Pletho opened a school accepting exoteric stu­dents (those who were tied to Catholic doctrine and could not accept the totality of Plato's doctrine) and esoteric students (those who were initiated into the doctrine of emanations and the complete doctrine of Hellenistic Platonism). Because of Pletho's actions, the Academy of Plato was brought back to life. In 1459, Marsilio Ficino, son of the private physician of Cosima de' Medici, formed (at Pletho's request) the first Platonic Academy and established it at the Villa Careggi, near Florence. For many years, the most important thinkers and artists of the time met, lived, and worked together in this authentic, secular monastery, which was open without any religious discrimination to all talented men. The initiates dedicated themselves to the search for truth, and they studied ancient texts that had been hidden for centuries in complete freedom. The only rule was that everyone must respect the freedom of others to study and ask questions. The members of this first Academy were \"brothers in Plato;' accord­ing to their historical testimony. To be an Academician, it was necessary to be \"good and honest\" and to have the desire to cultivate the best in oneself. As Marsilio Ficino himself once said: \"Friendship is the union of will and desires. The brother Academicians must share the same pur­pose.

Under the direction of Ficino (with the constant protection and insis­tence of Cosimo de' Medici), most of the ancient Hermetic, Platonic, and Neoplatonician texts were translated. It was then that the mem­bers of the Academy of Florence awakened the Hermetic Tradition of the ancient Neoplatonic philosophers. They gave life to the Aurea Cat­ena (\"Golden Chain\"), which linked the initiates to their ancestors. Besides the name of Marsilio Ficino, who was the founder of the Academy, the names of some of the other Academicians are also known, such as: Pica Della Mirandola, Fortuna, Giovani Cavalcanti, Alessandro de Rinaldo Braccesi, and, of course, Cosima de' Medici himself. Campanella, Giordano Bruno, Dante, and others were also in contact with the Academy. The Hermetic teachings offered at the school were given in both a theoretical and a ritual format. The efforts of these great men were extremely important in order to consolidate the theological and Qabalistic aspects of the Catholic Tradition with the Hermetic texts. From this time forward, it is possible to identify the progression of the Hermetic Tradition with a fair amount of pre­cision. These great scholars believed that every tradition had some­thing to offer, and they took the best, most original, and most useful ideas from Christianity and adapted them to Hermeticism. It is also important to understand that, before the development of this new Academy, Pletho travelled to Florence many times, in order to lengthen the \"golden chain,\" which he had received from the ancients. However, not all Church leaders had a favorable opinion of Pletho, who was known to understand and lecture on the tenets of the an­cient traditions, which were considered to be heresies. Some said that Pletho had secretly written a book, which was against Catholicism. Truthfully, Pletho did write a book, published with the title Nomoi (The Book of Laws). Filled with both the exoteric and esoteric ele­ments ofNeoplatonic and Hermetic spiritual and temporal teachings,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"22 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS this book only came to light after Plethos died in 1452. Moreover, as modern historians later discovered, Pletho seems to have organized a secret group of followers in Mistra, who practiced the ancient cults and forms of worship; his \"siblings\" were sustaining the ancient phi­losophy and mysteries. This brotherhood of Pletho's was really the heart of the Her­metic school. Monks, in particular Patriarch Gennadius II, threat­ened Pletho in a letter, claiming that it would be a \"crime to recreate numerous Gods, to warm up the lifeless ashes of polytheism after so many centuries and to ask that people worship philosophy as a sim­plified religion, whose goal would be to transform society according to the ideas of Zoroaster and Plato.\" If Pletho had succeeded, as Gen­nadius wrote, \"so that such profanities came to light in a book, he would claim the honor of battle and reserve the fire for the author of the book.\" Gennadius did not have this opportunity, because it was only after the death of Pletho that his book Nomoi (probably written between 1453 and 1459) found its way, by either misfortune or malice, to this patriarch. Gennadius wrote that, after some hesitation at reading the Nomoi's table of contents, he decided to read the entire book. He wrote later that he was \"scared, agitated;' that he \"rued the day this impiety was written, as there must be only one holy doctrine.\" Gen­nadius recommended that the Nomoi be burned; however, he did not entirely destroy his copy but only burned the most important parts of the book. In an attempt to justify his act, Patriarch Gennadius held on to a few sections of the book and wrote extensively about the book's contents, so that he might later justify his decision. This is how the book of Pletho perished. The inheritance of a grandmaster of the tradition was destroyed by the reigning religious and temporal powers of the day. However, before I reveal whether this heritage was able to be protected before its destruction and disap­pearance, I will share with you the nature of this \"impious\" book.

The Nomoi contained the description of a social and religious or­ganization that would have been the successor to the Neoplatonic so­ciety that Pletho wanted to create. This new organization would have helped the medieval world achieve release from its spiritual imprison­ment, where it had remained since the imposition of Catholic dog­matic laws forbidding free thought and the expression of the sciences and philosophy. Yet, the revolutionary ideas of the Nomoi extended much further than merely on the social and cultural level. Pletho re­vealed himself as a master and an initiate. He also described a reform of the religious world by reactivating the traditional mysteries and ceremonies. Pletho's role included the responsibility for keeping this inheritance alive, ensuring that the practices associated with this tra­dition survived intact. Pletho described rituals that would allow men and women to make contact with the divine powers called the Gods and Goddesses. You should begin by imagining what this revelation meant at this period in history, at the time of this group of followers who wanted to reintroduce these initiations. Let us imagine the consequences for them as they struggled to work and keep the theurgic and ritual practices alive, trying to bring aid to an oppressed civilization. This tradition, these ideas and these actions, constituted a huge threat to the extant religious power of the Catholic Church. Without a doubt, the Catholic Church viewed the beliefs of the Hermetic Tradition as the most dangerous attack imaginable to its power, for this tradition aimed all its intent at overturning the exoteric religious dogma im­posed by force upon the will of mankind. On the social level, the tra­clition's objective was to allow every human being the opportunity, the possibility, of experiencing the worship of the eternal Gods. The Hermetic Tradition indicated that every initiate could choose what­ever divinity would be compatible with his or her family traditions or even personal affinity. In this way, the existence and legitimacy of the eternal Gods were reasserted ."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"24 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS With the threats and persecutions promised by Patriarch Gen­nadius and other Catholic leaders, the followers and the initiated of Pletho were as prudent as possible. It was a fundamental priority for them that this Golden Chain of the Initiates was not broken, as the worship of the eternal divinities was a duty and a necessity, both for all men and women, and for the Gods themselves. THE TAROT, BIRTH OF THE HERMETIC KEYS Simply transmitting sacred mysteries to a hidden circle of initiates was not sufficient to accomplish Pletho's goal. You must remember that actions taken within the context of a tradition had to be clan­destine in order for the initiates to avoid being tortured and killed by Church authorities. Thus, it was necessary to provide public keys to the tradition, which only some people would recognize for what they were. Books were not a safe means of transmission, as we have seen in the case of Gennadius and the Nomoi. As such, the Tarot was to be­come the extraordinary tool that constituted the outward expression of Plato's doctrine as well as the key to its practical application. The relationship between the Tarot and the presence of this initiatic tradi­tion may not be immediately obvious. In addition to the explanations provided in this text, the power of these keys in theurgic practice will soon become clear. You should know that talismans and divine representations are important keys for magical practices. A talisman or pentacle helps you to establish contact with an invisible power by means of the sym­bolic representation of the potency therein. The same was true in the ancient sacred cults: the statue of the God or the Goddess was the receptacle or the channel that linked the worshiper to divine power. This is why it was so important for Pletho to provide public access to keys that would allow people to open these divine portals (arcana). With the aid of these keys, anyone who recognized their true nature could make contact with the traditional divinities. Pletho's task was to transmit these inner keys and to explain their principles.

THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS 25 In 1431, a man named Bessarion was received as a monk into the circle of the initiates of Mistra. Bessarion studied with Pletho and was initiated into the secret Ogdoadic and Hermetic doctrines. In 1437, Bessarion became the archbishop of Nicaea. He also participated in the Council of Florence and was a signatory of its final decree. Bessa­rion later left the Eastern Church to become a Roman Catholic. At this time, some popes almost openly supported the development of the Platonic and Hermetic ideas. Bessarion moved to Rome and his home became a center of study and philosophy. His home also be­came a refuge for Greek scholars leaving Constantinople, which had been invaded by the Turks. Like his master, Pletho, Bessarion was a Neoplatonist, studying the traditional teachings of the Careggi group. In his writings, Bessa­rion defended the inheritance of Plato against opposing theologians. Under the protection of the popes Nicholas V, Paul II, and Pius II, Bessarion translated many texts originating in the Greek tradition. Naturally, Bessarion belonged to the new Academy of Florence and had a close relationship with Nicholas de Cusa. As clearly recorded by the historians of the Tarot (Heinrich Brock­haus, for example), it was during the Council of Mantua, held be­tween June 1459 and January 1460, that Bessarion, Nicholas de Cusa, and Pope Pius II secretly conceived of the idea of the \"Tarot of Man­tegna.\" This Tarot is different from the more widely known Tarot that was synthesized into the \"Tarot of Marseilles.\" The Tarot of Mantegna (the title comes from the name of its artist, Andrea Mantegna) in­cludes fifty pictures organized into five groups of ten. The first group corresponds to the social order of the medieval epoch and the begin­ning of the Renaissance; the second group corresponds to the Muses (and Apollo); the third group to the liberal arts (including astrology, philosophy, and theology); the fourth group to the seven virtues (in­cluding astronomy, chronology, and cosmology) and the fifth group, the most divine, to the seven planetary Gods (including the fixed stars, the Primum Mobile and the Prima Causa-\"First Cause\"). It is evident that this system contains many esoteric keys that are blatantly Neoplatonic and Hermetic in origin. Therefore, these cards represent"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"26 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS Figure 3: The Tarot of Mantegna; a representation of the Hermetic world in one of the first Tarot decks.

Both Nicho­las de Cusa and Bessarion were very interested in divination, a prac­tice that was an essential part of the ancient traditions. As a result of his work, a treaty called De sortibus (\"Lots\") was dedicated to Bessarion. Pope Pius II, who was equally interested in the art of divination, declared that this literature was far superior to bor­ing Catholic theological studies.

Although unveiled, this symbology was not revealed to the general population, and its use remained restricted to the inner order. The keys to the use of the Hermetic Tarot of Man­tegna do not directly explain or account for the origin and use of the Tarot of Marseille by modern occultists. You must know that historians have amply demonstrated that the earliest uses of Tarot decks were as instruments of play and recre­ation; such uses continue to be the case even today. Moreover, the ear­liest publicized version of the Tarot was composed only of the Minor Arcana. Yet it must be understood that one of the most important rules of the initiatic traditions is to hide the most valuable inner keys in the most external and public of places. This strategy was realized at the end of the fifteenth century at the same time as the publication of the Tarot of Mantegna. The insertion of these Neoplatonic teach­ings and beliefs into the public sector was very discreet. The keys had to be present in the public eye without being easily detected. In this way, they would not arouse suspicion and it would be much easier for these valuable keys to be spread everywhere. The Tarot of Mantegna with its fifty Arcana was not suitable for that purpose. Bonifacio Bembo may have been the creator of a new series of cards, which was added to the Minor Arcana already in existence. This Tarot deck is called the Visconzi-Sforza Tarot. On the exoteric plane, the goal was to add a new set of cards to the original deck, in order to develop and increase the complexity of the original game. Of course, you would not be surprised to learn that Bonifacio Bembo, who en­gineered this change, was a Neoplatonist and a student of Pletho. The writings and thoughts of his master, Pletho, were present with him when Bembo created these new Arcana. It is also obvious that Bembo was in contact with the initiates from the Hermetic school of thought. Thus, the twenty-two Major Arcana (Trumps) were the outer mani­festation of a part of the teachings of the initiates of the inner school. The keys were disseminated in an almost complete form, yet they could be publically displayed without risk. At this juncture in history, the cards had neither names, numbers, nor any form of letters on their faces. It is therefore particularly dif-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"28 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS ficult, if not impossible, to know whether the number of cards was originally twenty-two. Could there have been more? Fewer? We re­ally do not know. But it doesn't matter; the number was settled on twenty-two, and it is clear that whoever originally chose this number did so in order to connect the deck with the Christian or Hermetic Qabalah. Of course, the Qabalah (which was ultimately developed in Her­metic circles) included the Hebrew Qabalah in the Tarot for his own aims. It was used to analyze the occult principles of Catholic doctrine, as well as to develop the structure of various rituals and practices. The Hebrew alphabet had a numeric value and a strong cultural influence, which continued in force over the next few centuries. By choosing a precise number for the Major Arcana (twenty-two), the Hermeticists planned to allow those with \"eyes to see\" to eventually be able to re­turn to the source, and thus to find the hidden messages and practices of the inner school. In the next chapter, it will become clear that find­ing these hidden messages and practices was rarely easy. Despite this difficulty, the Hermetic and Ogdoadic Tradition had succeeded in transmitting a set of occult keys to the outer world. It is for this reason that it is so important to understand these keys and then to find the initiates who continued to keep the process of initia­tion secret down through the centuries. Grandmaster Pletho, who was directly responsible for the birth of the Renaissance and indirectly for the creation and dissemination of the Tarot, died on June 26, 1452 (or 1454). It is interesting to note that the dead body of Pletho was later exhumed by Sigismond Pandolfe Malatesta and taken to Rimini (near Venice in the northeast of Italy). Today his body is in a sarcophagus, which was interred in a wall of the Tempio Malatestiano. Malatesta was a friend of, and under the direct protection of, Pope Pius II. Hopefully it is clear why this repatriation was an important symbol for the Ogdoadic Tradition. In order to set the sarcophagus into the stone, Malatesta had to make sweeping reno­vations in this ancient Gothic church. The task required the construc­tion of an entrance, including a triangular pediment in the antique style, as well as two symbolic vertical columns on either side.

Inside, THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS 29 you find eight chapels, which is a significant number for the Ogdo­adic Tradition. This building was to have given the court a triumphal setting as a \"pantheon of heroes\" according to the expression of Rudolf Witt­kower in his Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism. In an article in American Literature (Vol. 55, No.3), Michael North wrote that \"Sigismundo's rebuilding of the church of San Francesco could be thought of as a restoration because his changes essentially obliter­ated the Christian character of the building and gave it a pagan and somewhat neo-Platonic one.\" In fact, this was distinctly evident to such initiates as Pope Pius II, who wrote that Sigismundo \"had built a temple filled with pagan symbols\" (Canto 9:41). Michael North further explains: \"Roberto Valturio, Sigis­mundo's engineer, ascribes the decorations to Sigismundo's 're­search' and seems to subtly advertise their Hermetic nature by saying that they will appeal more to the learned than to the rabble. [ ... ] Their full meaning was known only to one man, and they were entirely personal to him. Therefore, it is impossible to pretend that the Tempio was constructed by a people or even a culture. Si­gismundo took possession of that church and reconstructed it into a building of his own design, replacing its cross with his own ini­tials, the decorations with his own devices ... \" These chapels were connected with the Neoplatonic teachings as well as the original Tarot of the initiates I am discussing in this book. Among the eight chapels, there is a chapel containing the virtues, Justice hav­ing the central place. Another of the chapels contains the Sibyls, another three classes of the spirits of air, and other Pythagorean teachings of har­mony. An extraordinary Chapel of the Planets contains seven planetary divinities and the twelve signs of the zodiac in their pagan and Neopla­tonic form. The chapels constitute an important representation of the esoteric and original Tarot of the initiatic and Hermetic Academy . It is clear that the original cards you will find (and be using) in this book are very close replicas of the divinities represented at the Academy. The eighth chapel contains eight Muses, seven symbolic representations of the liberal arts, and statues of both Proserpine and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"30 THE GOLDEN CHAIN OF THE MASTERS Apollo. The representation of the original system is thereby clearly manifested. Numbers used in the conception of this building are sig­nificant. With the construction of these eight pagan chapels, Malat­esta did more than make a simple representation of the secrets of the Ogdoadic Tradition. He placed seven sarcophagi on each side of the exterior of the church, in order that the total number of the \"outer guards\" of this temple would be fourteen. By the addition of the eight chapels and the fourteen sarcophagi, it is easy to see that the sum of these numbers is twenty-two. The history of the Hermetic Order (today known as the Ogdoadic Tradition, or Aurum Solis) has continued to exist throughout the cen­turies. This precious knowledge was retained so that it can be used effectively in the rituals and practices of this initiatic school. The Tarot in its exoteric version has continued to develop since its inception. It is important that you now look at what became of these cards, how they evolved, and what they have retained from their Her­metic creators. 4 TH�HI� ,J 1 j LEGEND OF u.q The Tarot derived from the � in three ways over the last sewl1�·. 1. as simple playing cards 2. as a system founded on 3. as a creation to invoke� crate energies both widJ verse (macrocosm). 1 Each card, or Arcanum�· a particular energy, which . · Tarot keys that you use in · � nected to the most ancient · can generate specific states�.· However, the classic s Marseille or other similar"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 THE HIDDEN TRUTH theurgist, can readily access and use. The Aurum Solis Tarot keys help to connect, in a better and more precise manner, to these powers. Obviously, there were many times throughout the centuries that esotericists had the intuition that these keys could be used to tap into archetypal energy. However, the real and effective keys that would permit this kind of theurgic work were never fully revealed. In fact, the contemporary popular esoteric interpretation is the result of de­velopments intended to extend the original version. This interpreta­tion remained captive to an exoteric structure that was impossible to change due to the absence of the proper perspective. The keys had not yet been revealed by the initiatic tradition that protected them. Thus, it is necessary to understand how this evolution occurred and how the original system can be used effectively today. NUMBERS AND THE QABALAH In the last chapter, I mentioned that there were no names or num­bers in the first publications of the Major Arcana. The first occult interpretations of the Arcana were completed by Court de Gebelin and the Comte de Mellet in 1781. De Mellet published a short article about the Tarot in the tome titled Le Monde Primitif (The Origins of the World), organized by Court de Gebelin. It was in this text that he mentions a correspondence between Hebrew letters and the cards. Court de Gebelin reprised this idea briefly in his own book. To justify his affirmations, Court de Gebelin explained that the word \"Tarot\" comes from an Egyptian word meaning \"the science of Mercury\" (Hermes and Thoth were indentified with Mercury). The theories Court de Gebelin developed about the magical char­acter of this game were used by another Freemason named Etteilla (a pseudonym for Jean-Fran<;:ois Alliette). Etteilla said that \"Tarot is a book that came from Ancient Egypt whose pages contain the secret of a universal medicine, of the creation of the world and of the destiny of man. It originated in the year 2170 BCE when seventeen magicians met in a conclave chaired by Hermes Trismegistus.

Finally, after various events, it was reproduced by inexperienced medieval engravers with a quantity of errors such that it was deprived of its original nature.\" Eteilla gave the name \"the Book of Thoth\" to the Tarot and changed a part of its iconography. It was Eliphas Levi who uncovered the major errors of Etteilla by underlining as a fundamental and absolute fact the relationship be­tween the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the twenty­two Major Arcana. For the first time, Levi explicitly explained the connection between the Trumps and the twenty-two paths of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. He deduced this from the close relationship between the magical Qabalistic practices associated with the keys and their symbolic representations. Levi became convinced that the Tarot did originate in ancient Egypt; he also concluded it originated from Jewish Qabalistic initiates and the Biblical Tradition. This relationship between the Tarot and the Hebrew Qabalah was never denied by later authorities on the subject, and there was a great deal of energy put into the task of verifying these associations. Kenneth R. H. Mackensie, who was a member of the Masonic so­ciety SRIA (the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia) met Levi in 1861. These teachings were transmitted to the SRIA, and then to the Golden Dawn, which was starting to grow very quickly at that time. In 1888, MacGregor Mathers published a book about the Tarot as a divina­tion tool. In continental Europe, Oswald Wirth, Stanislas de Guaita (founder of the Ordre Kabbalistique de la Rose-Croix2), and Papus continued to develop their own interpretations of the Tarot. All were masters of design and divination, as well as experts in Qabalistic and magical practical applications. Sir Arthur Edward Waite played an important role as the central figure of the Anglo-Saxon initiates in the Golden Dawn around the year 1903. With the help of his friend Pamela Colman-Smith (also a member of the Golden Dawn), he composed a new Tarot using the same principles found in Papus' deck. Waite's intention was to make the newer deck more explicit regarding its symbolic meaning. He had 2. The Qabalistic Order of the Rose-Cross: http:/ /www.okrc.org/."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"34 THE HIDDEN TRUTH every Major and Minor Arcanum redrawn. The new deck became the standard for esoteric studies. Aleister Crowley introduced some mod­ifications and also created a powerful Tarot deck with a unique and interesting design. Whatever the differences in the numbering of the Arcana, the use (or lack of) Hebrew letters, the differences in names and symbols, the Tarot used by all modern esoteric orders is based on the same founda­tion: the Hebrew Qabalah. You must remember that this fact follows naturally from the first correspondence established by Comte de Mel­let between the Hebrew alphabet and the Major Arcana. Everything follows logically from this point. Thousands of pages have been written to justify the correspon­dences between the symbolic representations (the Arcana) and the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Qabalists themselves admit that many things can be explained and justified by the use of the Qabalah. Such was the case for the Tarot. What began as a simple connection be­tween a sequence of numbers and a series of pictures became a self­evident truth. Once something is considered to be an incontrovertible fact, it becomes nearly impossible to challenge. Whether the mythi­cal origins of the Tarot were born of Egyptian legendary history, or a product of Moses' inheritance, there were no facts that might help a scholar to refute or confirm the hypothesis. Since the time of the Renaissance, the most widely known esoteric aspect has been the Qa­balah. The writings of Catholic Qabalists such as Athanasius Kircher and Heinrich Kunrath helped establish these associations as fact. So it now seems natural to consider the Hebrew Qabalah as the norm and that Tarot must conform to it. Of course, there were some doctrinal or esoteric contradictions present, but not enough to challenge the theories, because in fact the Qabalah was always used to justify many ideas. If you are merely considering the use of the Tarot for divination, these Qabalistic questions are unimportant. The truth is that this kind of divination is based on a mental convention.

When a meaning is presence of a particular card THE HIDDEN TRUTH 35 in a Tarot spread is an indication of its meaning. When the Tarot is used in this way, divination works perfectly. However, if you want to use the Tarot as a magical or theurgic tool, the relevance of Qabalistic associations becomes very important in­deed. You must have precise correspondences, ones not chosen by a toss of the dice. You must precisely connect the correct powers and energies to each Arcanum. I will now demonstrate to you several common mis­takes or misunderstandings of modern occultists in their use of these associations that have led them to some very erroneous conclusions. THE HIDDEN STRUCTURE The theurgic Ogdoadic Tradition teaches that the Qabalistic system is just a representation, a structure, or a map of an invisible reality. This system itself is not the truth; the system is merely a representation of the truth. That is why the theurgic initiates used the Qabalah as a Figure 5: Representation of the cosmos (according to the classical tradition), the four elements, and the seven planetary spheres by Robert Fludd."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"36 THE HIDDEN TRUTH Figure 6: The pagan representation of the universe on the Tarot of Mantegna. magical tool. They never forgot that the implicit theological doctrine of the Hebrews was not their way of looking at the cosmos. Energies do exist in the world. The Neoplatonic initiates realized that it was possible to connect with these energies with sacred signs and words. It is for this reason that Jewish Qabalists are absolutely correct when they say that modern Hermeticists are using the Hebrew alphabet for purposes that do not correspond to the Hebrew religious and mystical tradition. This view is quite accurate. Therefore, when you read this book and use these practices and rituals, it is important for you to remember that the principles of the Qabalah that you are using are not an admission of the truth and validity of the Hebrew theological doctrine. For reasons that you should now understand, the theurgic Neoplatonic Tradition never wanted to accept the com­plete Jewish or Catholic theological doctrine.

Thus, the Hermeticists welcomed, studied, and incorporated many ideas from newer traditions without changing their own fundamental principles. In the previous chapter, I reviewed the defining characteristics of our philosophy, the origins of the Tarot, and the historical lines of the development of this tradition. I revealed that the past masters who founded this tradition gave keys to understanding it, in the form of the Aurum Solis Tarot cards; the masters also gave a system for their practical use. This discussion of these critical elements has hope­fully helped you to understand the necessity for using the Greek cor­respondences with these Tarot cards from the Greek tradition. The Greek correspondences allow you (as the practitioner) to use this Tarot correctly, from a Hermetic, Neoplatonic, and theurgic perspec­Figure 7: The traditional configuration of the elements, planets, and stars in a book by Robert Fludd, 1617. tive. In this way, your use of the Tarot is based on the facts from which the keys were derived. The structure of the Hermetic world is perfectly represented in two particular Arcana of the Tarot of Mantegna. Let us not forget that this Tarot constitutes the vis­ible part of the internal teachings of this tradition. As you might expect, you find the representa­tion of the world to be a mirror of the world imagined by the early initiates and used in their rituals. Moreover, this representation is, even today, the same representa-tion used by all magical orders, schools, and Western astrologers. This ladder of emanations is composed of the four elements"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"i. j 38 THE HIDDEN TRUTH (plus Ether), seven planets, twelve zodiacal signs, the sphere of the fixed stars, and what I would describe as the \"Supreme Principle;' the Nous, the Grand Architect. This structure was used as a foundation for the Tarot of this Hermetic Tradition and for the ritual Hermetic practices. To begin this analysis, it will be necessary to forget all previous attributions and correspondences that you have learned from using other Tarot systems; these were added after the Tarot was originally created and are not a part of the original system (especially the names of the Arcana, the numbers, and the Hebrew letters). Deleting these later correspondences from your memory (not using them) is the only solution to the problem created by these later attributions, the only way to make real progress. Remember the goal of the Hermetic Tradition as explained in the last chapter: to help the ancient sacred mysteries to continue to exist, and to preserve the Golden Chain. In order to do that, it is necessary to allow human beings to use theurgic tools that are capable of establishing a genuine, actual contact with the eternal divinities. The doctrines of Pletho and the symbolic repre­sentations of the Tarot both demonstrated the necessity of revealing this to humanity so that the mysteries would be preserved. THE OLYMPIANS Correspondences must be sought out in original and universal sym­bols. The science of astrology is an enormous aid in this regard, be­cause it still utilizes (even today) those sacred symbols that were part of Pletho's original system. These sacred symbols link astrology to the spiritual and esoteric traditions of Chaldea, Egypt, and Greece. The symbols used to represent the zodiac were developed over several centuries, becoming the structure you know today: the twelve months, as used by the ancient theurgists, with twelve signs represent­ing twelve specific energies, whose nature we must understand before we can use them successfully in rituals and practices.

The Gods that correspond to the twelve months probably appeared in Egypt around 1600 BCE. On a specific day of each month, the God who governed that particu­lar month was honored with a special celebration. Babylonians used the same principle: twelve Gods corresponding to twelve months and to twelve signs of the zodiac. This historical data is documented in a first -century BCE book, Bibliotheca Historica, by the Greek historian Diodore of Sicily. Greece also had twelve Olympian Gods, which the Romans adapted to their own pantheon and to their own system of counting the months of the year. In Rome, these twelve Gods were called Di Consentes. Many references can be found in classical literature to these twelve divinities . The Gods were worshiped and they received requests and sacrifices. In the book of The Laws, Plato also refers to twelve Gods whom he links to the months of the year and to twelve categories of society. In the book Phaedre, Plato explains quite clearly that the twelve Gods are astral di­vinities (powers) that originate in ethereal space and act to give order to the cosmos. Before Plato's descriptions, it was difficult to be sure if the twelve Olympians were connected to the twelve months of the year. However, that was the case after his writings were published. Eudoxos of Cnidos, founder of the science of astrology, linked the twelve Gods to the signs of the zodiac. Even though the correspondences between the divinities and the twelve months of the year are clear, the connection between the Gods and the twelve astrological signs is not as immediately obvious. How­ever, the science of archaeology offers a solution, providing several elements whereby I may establish this correspondence. The first such object is undoubtedly a circular altar found in Gabii, Italy, in 1793. It was dated to the first century BCE and is a circular slab of stone dec­orated with the busts of twelve divinities. Each divinity is identified by its characteristic symbols. The twelve divinities are carved into the stone around the top of the altar, and the astrological signs are carved into the circumference of the supporting pillar, thereby connecting them with the divinities. This circular altar (as well as other structures of a similar nature) confirms this fundamental symbolic relationship."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40 THE HIDDEN TRUTH Specific letters from the Greek alphabet were also associated with each of these twelve signs. The Greeks used consonants exclusively. As you can easily see in the Qabalistic text called the Sepher Yetzirah, the Hebrews did this same thing later in history. This book was the founda­tion of the Catholic Qabalistic revival. Therefore, it is logical to use it here. The chart below shows these Greek and Hebrew correspondences.

You can see the planets that are visible to you with your unaided senses, since this is how the ancients viewed them.

The Neo­platonic and Ogdoadic Tr adition chose the Chaldean ascending se­quence, which puts the Sun at its center (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). This succession is used in most versions of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, in which planets are attributed to the Sephiroth. From the time of the Chaldeans, it has been well-known that the lunar month is divided into four parts, each composed of seven days. These seven days were allocated to seven divinities very early on. In the Greek system, the seven divinities are: Helios, Selene, Ares, Hermes, Zeus, Aphrodite, and Kronos. Vowels were linked to these di­vinities (I, A, 0, E, U, H, A). Hebrew Qabalists made similar attribu­tions. The chart below shows these correspondences.

All this is perfectly diagrammed and discussed in the Corpus Hermeticum (fragment XXVI-13 and sq., as well as Treaty XIII-17). Theogony, the fundamental text of Hesiod, develops the myth of cre­ation as the intervention of five divine and active principles that gave birth to the cosmos. The five divine aspects here are: Ouranos, Gaia, Pontos, Eros, and Aether. Just as the structure of the higher planes was connected to seven letters, there were five Greek letters connected to these Gods and Goddesses (see chart below). It is surprising to note that the Hebrew Qabalah is disconnected from the traditional systems, omitting the two principles of Spirit and Earth. Perhaps the explanation for this omission lies in the fact that the Hebrew alphabet is limited to twenty-two letters. Of course, this limitation is reflected in more than the omission of the Spirit and Earth principles. Still, it is obvious that the principles of nature and the body were generally rejected (or were treated as obstacles) in Judaism and Catholicism. Our traditions have a very different perspective in that regard and are linked directly or indirectly to all modern Western esotericists and initiates.

In summary, I have revealed a system composed of twenty-four divine powers corresponding to the traditional numerical sequence of five, seven, and twelve. This extremely ancient structure provides you with a very clear definition of the divine powers at work in the mac­rocosm and microcosm. For centuries, their figures have been well­known and codified. Their power has been invoked and worshiped by all humanity down through the ages. Moreover, these divinities are represented in the Tarot of Mantegna and can be found in the temple where Pletho was buried. On the invisible level, it was these divinities who managed the creation of the Major Arcana of the Tarot. These divinities constitute the occult power, the spirit and life of the Tarot. They keep the Tarot alive and they are the point of origin for the en­ergy that the esoterists and diviners drew upon.

Indeed, the Hebrew Qabalistic structure founded on the Sepher Yetzirah is incomplete. The explanation for this is quite clear and very easy to understand. For theological reasons, which are distinctive to their beliefs, the Hebrews excluded Earth and Ether from their principles. Because of this omission, any attempt to estab­lish a correspondence between an initiatic system having its origin in the sacred Neoplatonic mysteries with the Hebrew Qabalah pres­ents some very real problems. There have only been a few modern magicians who recognized that omission and attempted to solve the problem by adding the two missing principles. You see evidence of an attempted solution in the book 777 by Aleister Crowley, as well as in the charts of the magical tradition at the time of the Golden Dawn. The Ordo Aurum Solis has also made this correction. There is a path numbered thirty-two, corresponding to Earth, and another path numbered thirty-one, corresponding to Spirit (Ether). As you know, the Tree of Life pattern that is traditionally used doesn't have paths thirty-one and thirty-two. In other words, the correspondences of the Major Arcana of the Tarot in relation to the twenty-two He­brew letters did not include these two principles. It is surprising that modern occultists have not advanced any further than this one cor­rection, especially regarding a question of this importance. However, it often seems that there is a certain inertia once a structure becomes formalized, and that intuition may be too weak to overcome it. Up to this point, I have explained the Hermetic and Theurgic Tra­ditions in simple and practical terms. Yet, before these practices can be used in a balanced and effective way according to divine principles, they must be based on a clear tradition that is well-known to all. No exception to this rule is possible. This is the only precondition for the proper theurgic use of this system of the Major Arcana. The Ogdoadic Tradition, which stems from Neoplatonism, retained these original principles and (as you will see) uses two keys that correspond to Earth and Ether (Spirit), thus correcting this major deficit.

In this regard, please remember that this twenty­two key Tarot is only an external version in order to show how to use the Tarot in magic rituals as well as divination. The common Tarot is not the canonical and dogmatic version revealed by divinity. There­fore, these two hidden keys have been added to the other twenty-two for practical purposes. At the beginning of your work with these new keys, their inclusion in the deck may feel strange to you, yet the charts of the traditional vision of the universe and the sacred alphabets very clearly show the importance of including these keys. You now understand that the sacred language of the Theurgic Tradition was not Hebrew (although it has been used), but Greek. All the ancient Hermetic books were written in the Greek language, and Proclus and Iamblicus, as well as the other initiates, used this language in their rituals and invocations. Greek was associated with words in various \"barbaric\" languages, such as Egyptian, Chaldean, etc. The ritual tools, Orphics (from Orpheus) and Isiacs (from Isis), demonstrate the primary use of the Greek tradition. Different studies show that the practices used by the Hebrew Qabalah (Gematria, No­tarikon, etc.) were used in the Greek system prior to the existence of the Bible. Greek is a language strongly connected to an egregore that has endured for many centuries. Thus, the answer is that the Hebrew Qabalah veiled the heart of this sacred temple and the use of Greek as the language of that inner temple. The publications of the previous grandmasters of Aurum Solis have already revealed a great deal concerning this relationship be­tween the Arcana and the Neoplatonic Tradition. The earlier publica­tions were the first to be explicit about the correspondences of the magical names in Greek with the Arcana (including the two hidden Arcana). They expanded on this in the published work on planetary magic by outlining the relationship of the sacred vowels to the ancient divinities. These were very important presentations that prepared the way for a deeper understanding of the egregore of our tradition. To summarize, the Major Arcana of the Tarot are based on a veiled original structure constituted of divinities corresponding to twelve signs, seven planets, and five elemental powers. The founding initiates"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"46 THE HIDDEN TRUTH decided to represent and manifest the principles of their philosophy and their goal in this manner as the transmission of the philosophical, esoteric, initiatic, and religious inheritance of Hermeticism. With these principles in mind, when the Tarot is utilized as a theurgic instrument, the picture on the card you use must be as close as possible to the original archetype. This is the only way that Tarot cards can fulfill their roles as talismans and tools for the invocation of the divine powers. This is the way that the Tarot was transmitted in the circles of the Italian Hermeticists; this is the way that the Tarot is still used within the Ogdoadic Tradition. The book you are now reading will reveal these authentic theoretical and practical uses of the Tarot keys, as well as their original correspondences. NUMBERS AND THE SACRED ALPHABETS You must now understand how the numbers and Hebrew letters have been allocated by modern occultists on the Tree of Life. Once you un­derstand this, you will be able to begin using these cards for theurgic work. At their inception, the Major Arcana had neither numbers nor names, and they were memorized prior to use. Over a period of many years, a deck with names and numbers printed on each card gradu­ally emerged; this strategy may have been employed in order to make them easier to use. However, at this moment in time, there is noth­ing in the history of the Tarot that justifies one classification over an­other. There was nothing that justified designating a correspondence between a particular number and a particular card, rather than some other card and number relationship. The Hebrew letters were not ini­tially present as a part of the scheme. It was not until the eighteenth century and the brief text by Comte de Mellet that an emphasis on the fundamental value of numbers and letters as a hieroglyphic support for the pictorial system began. However, you can easily see that this attribution follows the original order of the Major Arcana without other considerations.

The Sepher Yetzirah is clearly the origin of the correspondences I presented in the charts earlier mentioned. The three elements, seven planets, and twelve signs that are represented by the Hebrew letters were put forth by Hebrew Qabalists in the book Etz Chaim, in the version written by Rabbi Isaac Luria. If you examine the evidence, it is easy to see that every Hebrew Qa­balist used the same correspondences among the Hebrew letters and the paths on the Tree of Life.

Simply put, and without any reference to the considerations previously explained, using an arbitrary sequence Kirscher numbered the paths linking the Sephiroth, beginning with the first and continu­ing in a descending order to the last Sephiroth. After that was accom­plished, Kirscher associated the Hebrew letters with the numbers that he had just allocated according to the classical sequence (see Figure 13): 1 =Aleph, 2 =Beth, etc. This was done without reference to any symbolic or esoteric (deeper) meaning; it was a simple numbering system. When you realize this, you are not surprised that such Qaba­listic texts as the Zohar provide an esoteric explanation as to why the biblical creation myth begins with the letter Beth and not the letter Aleph. Remember that Aleph is not the first letter of the first word of the Torah, but Beth: Bereshith! To summarize thus far, this representation of the Qabalistic Tree was really not checked against, nor compared with, the Hebrew tradi­tion. Modern occultists immediately followed Eliphas Levi, using these arbitrary correspondences by Kircher to associate the elements with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Air was connected to the eleventh path,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"50 THE HIDDEN TRUTH linking Kether and Chokmah (the thirteenth path linking Kether and Tiphareth to the Moon/ Yesod etc.). Of course, no justification for this attribution was offered from the text of the Sepher Yetzirah. The posi­tion of the paths on the Qabalistic Tree was just as arbitrary as Kircher's attributions. You see the same pattern in the attributions of the other letters, the elements, the planets, and the signs. When you look at the Tree of Life diagram with this in mind, it is clear that its use as a repre­sentation of the order of the universe is completely lost. The history of the Tarot has shown that occultists associated these correspondences with the Tarot, beginning with numbers, then He­brew letters, and then astrological associations. In this way, the num­ber 1 and Aleph were then \"logically\" associated with Air, which became a correspondence of the path linking Kether to Chokmah. You may be surprised that these correspondences depended on only numerical transpositions; especially as the consequence of this choice was that the traditional correspondences effectively disappeared from public understanding. Over the next several centuries, many occult­ist attempted to bring coherence and meaning to something that had lost its true structure a long time previous. You may imagine that correspondences created for the Tarot Trumps would be the logical consequence of this elaboration. Con­sidering what I revealed about the history of the Tarot and the Qaba­listic system founded by modern occultists, there should be an easily distinguishable correspondence between the Hebrew letters and the planets or signs. The only difference in the attributions in the chart below depends upon the relative position of the Fool-whether it is at the beginning of the sequence or not.

The contradiction is obvious, and these contradictions exist throughout Waite's system of numerical attributions. Another example of contradictory attributions may be found if you examine the astrological attributions. For example, you would expect that the Hebrew letter attributed to the High Priestess should correspond to the planet Mars (Gimel =Mars) according to the Qa­balistic texts.

The answer is simple: there is no justification! The only explanation given is based on modifications made by MacGregor Mathers, who attempts to justify this irrational arrange­ment by explaining that the astrological and numeric permutations were assigned according to the aesthetic appearance and symbolic aspect of each card. When this aesthetic approach had been satisfac­torily completed (from their perspective), those Arcana that seemed unclear were progressively redrawn until they suited the scheme. The fact remains that most of these attributions are strange and even difficult to justify. It would easily be possible to imagine numerous other correspondences that would be equally possible to justify sym­bolically. Therefore, I believe it was simply easier for Mathers to do what he did and to name this new contradictory sequence \"The Secret Order of the Tarot Trumps.\" Obviously, this sequence was attributed to the Inner Order of the Golden Dawn.

Obviously, the problem is magnified when contradictory forces (such as numerical and astrologi­cal attributions that are in opposition, numbers that are different than their actual Hebrew letter value, etc.) are written on the same Arcana. The result of these systemic contradictions is that any magical use of these Arcana would be hazardous and unpredictable. Imagine that you wanted to perform an invocation or do a ritual at a distance in order to work a healing for a friend. How do you decide whether to use the Hierophant or the High Priestess? What Greek or Hebrew letter would you use? What magical and sacred names would you invoke? What divinity would you attempt to connect to? As you explore these problems, the only possible logical conclusion you can reach is that either the traditional Qabalistic sequence is wrong, or the Sepher Yetzirah is incorrect. How are you supposed to judge who is correct between the Qabalistic Hebrew tradition and MacGregor Mathers? How would you be able to reach a satisfactory conclusion? I have some suggestions to help you resolve this quandary. Perhaps it would be easier to permute the Hebrew letters and write them on the Arcana corresponding to the planets. Undoubtedly, it would be better to do so, and the Tarot would have been more coherent had they taken this approach from the beginning. Yet, there is a certain inertia to traditions, and it is very difficult to help people shift their frame of reference and see things from a new perspective. Likewise, you may find it difficult to step out of the established framework and to reconsider the attributions of the Tarot Arcana to the paths on the Tree of Life as established by Kircher. This tendency for systems to persevere is how \"traditions\" are created. The Ogdoadic Tradition's solution to the problems created by these errors, and to the use of the Arcana for theurgic practices with the Tarot, is simple: Aurum Solis relies on the tradition that has been passed down to us from past masters who were present at the birth of the Tarot.

The traditional sequence for the numbers 5, 7, and 12 and the keys associated with them (as previously explained and justi­fied above). 2. The original correspondence of the sacred Greek letters. 3. The original Qabalistic correspondence of the sacred Hebrew letters. 4. The Greek divinities associated with this system for the last sev­eral thousand years. 5. The sacred names corresponding to these divine powers. When you understand and utilize these points (which are based on the most ancient traditions) in your theurgic practices, they enable you to make immediate contact with the divine powers. The coher­ent structure of this system on all levels gives access to a power and a force that you will feel immediately during your rituals. The rep­resentations of each of the Arcana are founded on the classical rep­resentations of the divinities. As a result of these potent and correct attributions, each Arcanum acts as a genuine and effective talisman. The magical names written on the cards immediately result in a po­tent response from the inner planes. The Tarot of Mantegna, as well as the representations of the Chapel of the Planets of the Tempio Ma­latestiano in Rimini, gives symbolic representations of the planetary divinities, which can be found in the theurgic Tarot explained in this book. They are a very important aid in the interpretation of the Ar­canum. The divination system of the Ogdoadic Tradition also utilizes the classical representations of the divinities. The choice of a particular Arcanum as a talisman or tool for invo­cation and magic is identified according to the logical rules that con­stitute the basics of our system; in other words, the choice is based on the nature of the God or Goddess himself or herself. The link to that God or Goddess, and the resulting power that you achieve as a result of your theurgic practice, will be all the more powerful because of the strength of these connections."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"56 THE HIDDEN TRUTH Having clarified these considerations, it is also important to ex­plain that it is possible to use these Hermetic principles to connect with the Angel of the Ta rot of the more commonly used decks (i.e., the exoteric presentations released by the Hermetic School). However, in order to assure that the coherence is maintained, this connection must be accomplished congruent with the five points listed above, which constitute the heart of the Neoplatonic system. This means that the \"secular\" sequence (the sequence you are used to using) will not be respected in the readings and rituals, even though you may be using a different deck. In other words, you must attend to the prin­ciples I have outlined, and interpret the \"modern\" Major Arcana as I have outlined their allocation to the planets, astrological signs, and elements consistent with the true symbolic criteria and meaning I have provided. The justification for the use of these correspondences (within our five principles) is that both the Arcana of the Ta rot of Marseille and Waite's Ta rot are the exoteric aspect of the divine pow­ers working behind these veils. Therefore, it is perfectly acceptable to use your Major Arcana once you have relocated them in their proper place as indicated below on the chart of the divinities. The chart on the next pages will allow you to make this transition easily, without any strain. The numbers in the first column are only used to distinguish among the elements, planets, and signs. Thus, these numbers have no specific meaning with regard to this system; they are just markers. The Arcana of the divinities of the divine Ta rot (the Aurum Solis Ta rot) are not assigned numbers; they are only assigned letters from the sacred alphabets. The numbers of the paths on the Tree of Life must not be associated with the arbitrary modern numbering. These numbers must be applied to the representation of the Tr ee of Life, and this will be explained in detail later in this book. In the next chapter, you will see how the planets, the Hebrew and Greek letters, and the divinities must be placed on the Sephirothic Tree if you want to use this system properly. The importance of at­tending to this detail prior to performing rituals cannot be overem­phasized.

All those who have linked themselves to the Tarot have contributed to its egregore by giving the Tarot a gen­uine identity and an actual existence. It should be noticed that this reality exists in spite of the differences between the several representa­tions of the Arcana. A very old esoteric principle explains that every­thing that is given a name actually exists on the invisible level. This ancient principle is called \"the power of the word.\" The more users there are, the more the existence of the particular angel (spirit) is validated, and that makes the angel (spirit) more powerful. In the same way, those who use the Tarot with the intention of acting on the symbolic level and who are aware of their work in relation to the invisible world considerably increase the power of the Angel of the THE DIVINITil Tarot.

In the intention of acting on work in relation to the Dfiii:)Wt�r of the Angel of the THE DIVINITIES AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TAROT 63 Tarot. The forces that are invoked by these users will be concentrated, linked together, and increased. If you could observe the invisible plane at this stage of the con­stitution of the Angel of the Tarot, you would discover a special and powerful energy that would be like a slightly pulsating nebula em­anating various colors of the rainbow. When initiates use the Tarot Trumps while being in a receptive state of consciousness, a contact is created on the invisible plane between them and this potent energy. A thin wire of luminous energy attaches these initiates to this radiant center. Since the first uses of the Tarot, these bonds have been consis­tently reinforced, with each initiate benefiting from the development of this form of intelligence. The relationship that is established flows in both directions (with both parties benefiting, so to speak). Thus, as the number of users in­creases, the power of the spirit, this Angel of the Tarot, increases, and this actively reinforces the presence of the Tarot in divination, mak­ing the Angel of the Tarot itself more potent. To understand how this process occurs on the invisible level, you can use the analogy of the development of consciousness in a human embryo. The concentra­tion of energy I have just described corresponds to the creation of the physical body of the fetus, before the appearance of its consciousness. Nobody knows with any certainty how this consciousness appears or when the mind begins to be aware of its own existence. Likewise, we cannot say when the Angel of the Tarot becomes \"conscious.\" There are two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the consciousness of this Angel of the Tarot awakens gradually, like a child's consciousness; the second is that the activation of this intelligence of the Tarot was the work of initiates who used particular rituals to awaken it. This practice is very similar to the creation of familiar spirits that you find in the Western Magical Tradition. As with any ritual work at this level, the ex­planation as to how it works must obviously remain veiled. I may only say that this was the second step of the occult work of our ancestors, just after the creation of the Tarot itself. This occult work created the compression and concentration of the divine energies, and this process"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"64 THE DIVINITIES AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TAROT gave life to a real entity that some later called the Angel (or Spirit) of the Tarot. Once the Angel of the Tarot became conscious, it began to grow and develop, and it has not ceased developing and growing in power since that time. Thus, when you work within what we could call the \"World of the Tarot:' you immediately place yourself in relation to this entity. If this link is not built consciously, it is established with a receptive mind. Feeling this call, the Angel of the Tarot directs its power toward you, and you can use this power. Various methods exist to intensify this contact, and the first method for that is to use your intention and your will. If you don't know these more advanced techniques (which I will develop in the next few chapters), then you may try this simple tech­nique. Take the Tarot deck in your hands and concentrate on the Angel of the Tarot. When concentrating, you must call on the Angel of the Tarot and ask it to give you light and guidance for your work and consultation. On the invisible plane, this intention will start a special process. Usually the invisible bodies surround you as a group of ovoids of energy with varying degrees of density. When you place a Tarot deck in your hands with the intention of using it, an intense, powerful, and luminous illumination appears in your aura. Your call to the Angel of the Tarot appears to the Angel as an open spot through which it may direct energy to help you. This may be likened to holes in the clouds that allow sunlight to pass through them. However, in this case, the process begins with the rays of energy leaving the heart of your being, crossing through this opening, and moving toward the heart of the Angel of the Tarot. Your will to perform this action gives rise to a very special and strong vibratory link. Once this connection is established, energy will flow down toward your being, creating a real link to the Spirit of the Tarot during the period of your divination or work. If this invocation is not accomplished voluntarily, the opening in your aura that I described above will not occur, and the rays of energy will not emanate from the Angel to you. Your wish to be receptive, a passive attitude of wishing to receive, is what triggers this effect.

THE DIVINITIES AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TAROT 65 Everyone who actively works with the Tarot creates a kind of \"psy­chic echo,\" which the Angel of the Tarot feels. To explain how this works, imagine that you are picking up a Tarot deck. Try to think of that moment, when you pick up the deck, in this way: Imagine a calm surface of water with a rock at its center, only partially visible. If you throw a stone into the water, the waves that appear on the water's sur­face will eventually reach the rock. Once these undulations strike the rock, a series of concentric waves will bounce back toward you (as you are the originator of this phenomenon). You must remember that the Angel of the Tarot ex­ists independently of you, just as the rock exists independently of the person who throws the stone. The wave generated by your will and in­tention when you touch the Tarot deck will reach the Angel and cause an immediate echo that will reverberate back to you. The difference is that the response of the Angel will be direct. However, if you have not opened your aura by using special tech­niques of concentration, then the energetic response coming from the Angel of the Tarot might be stopped or reduced when it comes in contact with your aura. If your invisible bodies are very reactive to any external intrusion, then only a very small portion of the energy and inspiration will reach you. Therefore, you can certainly see the importance of developing a real awareness of the nature of your re­lationship to the Angel of the Tarot. Understanding this relationship and the process by which it is established allows you to easily create the right conditions and thus manifest an effective result. In this way, you may begin to see the importance of this Angel of the Tarot. Work with the Tarot has many different aspects: it may in­volve a study of the divinities that correspond to a specific card, or an inner working (a meditation, for example), or a specific practice for someone else (which will be described in the next few chapters), or it may be used for divination. In each of these cases, the phenomena I just described play a very important role. It is clear that you can think, feel, and act by yourself, independently of any action or outside assis­tance, but the conscious use of these invisible forces is very significant and powerful."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"66 THE DIVINITIES AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TAROT When you study the cards and their symbols, their characters, and the lives of the portrayed divinities, you start to unveil deeper mean­ings, and this study allows you to be able to increase your knowledge. However, you use more than just the knowledge you have. The sym­bolic work extends well beyond that. With any study of this sort, you must remember the laws previously mentioned: the law of correspon­dences, the rules governing signatures, and the direct power of the cards. The symbols that are associated with each of the divinities help you to find meaning during your studies, meditations, and contem­plations. Eventually you will realize that these meanings and connec­tions you uncover do not occur by chance but are directly influenced by the divine powers associated with that card. Your study and analysis is guided by these influences. However, although this symbolic study considerably exceeds a traditional analy­sis, there are some levels that are more difficult to reach. If one desires to reach these levels, it becomes necessary to do \"out of body\" work in order to connect with these influences. It is in this \"out of body\" context that the Intelligence of the Tarot and the different divinities can interact with you, creating steps to facilitate the evolution of your consciousness, which ultimately exceeds the simple human sphere where you work most of the time. When you use these energies to work on yourself or other people, the divinities will allow you to harmonize the powers we select from among the Tarot cards. You are choosing to work under their benevo­lent protection, which will guarantee a more powerful energy. It is the same for the Angel of the Tarot, because you must remember that this Angel is the link among all the people using the Tarot. When you use the Tarot for divination, it is essential to be open to divine inspiration. You may adopt one of two different attitudes. The first attitude is that your research may simply be connected to questions regarding various aspects of the future and the life of the person consulting the cards. The most traditional inquiries are those concerning love, money, profession, etc. In this case, the interpreta­tion is not limited to the theoretical knowledge of the Tarot reader, as he or she will act as a medium between the universal Intelligence of THE DIVINITIES� the Tarot and the person channel that allows a power: be manifested in the con pretation by the reader.

It is extremely intriguing to be able to explicitly call the divini­ties and the Angel of the Tarot to ask them to answer your questions. There are many situations in your life in which you realize that you do not really know what to do, or how to choose from among several possibilities. In that case, it is very reassuring to ask the divinities for advice. Then you will be able to know the consequences of making one choice versus another choice. To gain this advantage, you must voluntarily call upon the Angel or divinity. You must recognize that this divinity functions in the shadow of your perceptions, and has a wider perspective than you do. With this understanding, you will be able to balance and reconnect your soul to the harmonious divine powers of the cosmos ."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THl: l:SOTl:RIC USl:S A discussion of the esoteric uses of the Tarot must focus on how you can study the Tarot and use it. Most of the study books written for the Tarot emphasize the theoretical meanings related to divinatory practices. These generally employ the most modern Tarot decks. Of course, divination is usually focused on symbolic interpretations. As I have explained previously, the Tarot is an effective channel that allows you to receive information and advice from the invisible plane. To use the cards on an esoteric level, you must study the symbols of the Ar­cana. It is not my intention to minimize this approach and use but, for now, I want to focus on a use that is normally held to be occult. When I say that there is an esoteric plane, I do so by making an affirmation of, \"There exists something hidden behind the symbolic representations I find on the cards.\" Step by step, you gradually learn how to use the Tarot as a useful tool for your inner development, which helps you to attain even higher levels of consciousness. Each person must progress through these steps in a precise sequence, in order to open his or her mind and subtle bodies to this new dimen­sion. Once that happens, the training will not be only intellectual;"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"70 THE ESOTERIC USES it also becomes a genuine inner experience, which connects under­standing to transformation. You will notice that it is a question of undertaking a real initiatic path, starting with some inner work. The Tarot offers you several possibilities, and you will use these for your advancement, in all their aspects and qualities. I will now summarize the most important elements of this initia­tion into the Tarot: 1. The theoretical and symbolic studies of each divinity corre­sponding to the Arcana of the Tarot. 2. Meditations, which work to activate the symbolic imagination. 3. The use of ritual gestures, declamations, sacred words, and ac­tive symbols, which allow the Angel of the Tarot to affect the different levels of your psyche. After working on these three different aspects with the help of the initiatic rules, you will be able to use the Tarot timely for a specific purpose or to work magic at a distance, with the maximum result. The powers present within each Arcanum act on the invisible plane but they generate a real effect on the physical and psychological level. It is important to note that you will be able to accomplish occult works of power without waiting for a complete mastery of the entire Tarot deck. For this purpose, you will undoubtedly find very useful the tables of correspondence among the divinities and the different parts of the body, various diseases, and psychological problems. Even if you are at the very beginning of your studies, and have not completed the work on the Tarot Trumps, it will not create a problem for you to use these cards. In this case, the power used will come di­rectly from the divine powers represented on each Arcanum. These energies are sufficient to lead to a satisfactory result. Once you have achieved reharmonization, your intellectual and inner understanding of the Arcana will reinforce the power of the card when you practice those rituals. You will progress step by step, gradually activating this divine aspect in all its dimensions, reaching into the deepest layers of your psyche.

Clearly, before you can learn how to use the Tarot as a system, and comprehend the meaning of its twenty-two Trumps, you must have a theoretical understand­ing of the Tarot's nature, structure, and purpose. This implies a pe­riod of apprenticeship during which the meaning, the character, and the symbols of each card must be learned. This is true whether you are learning about the divinities of the Aurum Solis Tarot or any of the other Tarot decks you might want to use. Thus, it is necessary to memorize and work toward understanding the meaning of the rep­resentations, the names of each of the Arcana, the Greek and Hebrew letters, as well as the planetary, zodiacal, and elemental symbols as­sociated with each card. In the next part of the book, you will find the fundamental in­formation you will need to learn about each card. Later on, you may 73"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING also use this information in conjunction with the different aspects of each card. Once you understand the individual keys thoroughly (as you expand your knowledge), it will become increasingly important for you to understand the relationships among the cards. In the more common systems of the Tarot currently available, these relationships are not very easy to find, let alone to understand and assimilate. In the esoteric Aurum Solis Tarot (thanks to the initiates of the Ogdoadic Tradition of the Renaissance), the system of relationships is clearly defined, and this clarity allows you to immediately see the relation­ship among different cards. Each Tarot Trump is associated with a specific divinity. It will be immediately apparent to the astute reader that each of these divinities has a special relationship together. Reading about and understanding the lives and personalities of these eternal divinities will unveil their structure of relationships. Understanding the connections among the divinities allows you to see, feel, and increase your connection to the powers of each card. This is much more than an intellectual exercise. As you connect with these divinities, you will develop a very real re­lationship with, and access to the personal powers of, each divinity. Once you understand the material at the beginning of the book, you may extend your understanding by practicing readings, performing meditations, etc. More information will be provided about these im­portant practices later in the book. Remember that you can add this occult-level information to your current understanding of the more common exoteric correspondences of the Tarot. In this way, you will be able to make practical use of the theoreti­cal studies; they are multiform and can be easily adapted to the dif­ferent situations you will come across in your use of these Tarot cards in your daily life. You may find it useful to devote a special notebook or index cards to this topic to write notes during your training and learning. In this notebook, it is a good idea to summarize your read­ings, meditations, personal thoughts, and, of course, the result of your own practices.

The symbolic dimension is the continuation, extension, and natural development from your theoretical studies. In fact, these two aspects of your study are not completely disparate; thought must inevitably be the foundation of symbolism. Thought is the gate be­tween reason and imagination, which is the seed (germ) of your inner development. You must become aware that \"imagination\" and \"imagi­nary\" are two very different things. \"Imagination\" is always composed of different elements that are already present in your mind. The mental combination of these ele­ments improves your life. Imagination is really very close to the ability to invent, and this ability allows you to be more adaptable to the vari­ous challenges that confront you in life. Your imagination helps you to anticipate your actions and to see the consequences of those ac­tions before you commit to a particular direction. Imagination is also a rich source of illusion, including fantasies, fancy, or the imaginative part of life. Imagination is a dimension of the spirit, which must be put into order by meditation and the practice I call visualization. I may say that imagination is a part of your mind that is not naturally controlled. Theoretical study is therefore a very precious tool because you can use it to be set free from bondage to your ever-changing moods by taking control of them. \"Imaginary\" is very different. In general terms, I agree that any­thing that is \"imaginary\" is imagined, and therefore unreal. In the common parlance, the \"imaginary realm\" is a fantasy, something that only exists in your mind, and is not usually considered as a real func­tion of the mind. It is for this reason that legends or fairy tales refer to imaginary places. However, there is something beyond the popular and commonly understood notion of this term \"imaginary realm.\" Though it may be difficult to understand at first, the imaginary realm is not as fanciful and fantastic as most people have believed. The imaginary realm is a real function of the mind and it is different from your personal use of imagination. The imaginary realm is a part of your mind that is open to the higher dimensions of the universe. In order to move through these different planes, you must access this"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"76 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING realm, this function, through the use of meditation, or by ritual prac­tice using the esoteric symbols of the cards and the myths connected to them. In other words, you use your imagination to move through the imaginary realms and to thus interact with the invisible planes. As the psychoanalyst Carl Jung taught, your unconscious is not closed in on itself. It is open to a common dimension shared by all human beings, termed the \"collective unconscious\"; this is a super­conscious dimension in which universal symbols are shared with the whole of humanity. A good illustration of this fact is the very close relationship between the original myths of different religions and cul­tures all over the world. The symbols and divinities you find in the Arcana were prepared for you by the ancients, to be used as a link, a bridge, between your psyche and a higher and inner dimension that you normally use unconsciously. MEDITATION The meditation I will discuss in the upcoming pages is the medita­tion of the Western Tradition. You do not begin by emptying your mind. The goal is to remove any intrusive thoughts and to control your psyche so that you can focus on whatever you choose to imagine. However, you must not reduce the visualization (which I will describe later in the book) to a mere exercise in concentration; concentration is merely the initial phase of this technique. The meditative process is used to integrate the symbol, to give it life, and to be able to find its meaning without the help of the intellect. You may use the Tarot in three steps to accomplish this process. In the first step, you will create a mental representation of the di­vinity and the setting you see on every Arcanum. Then you may add different elements to this scene, which you may find in historical doc­uments regarding the divinities. This process will permit you to have a more complete and active Arcanum that will be personal to you. However, bear in mind that the Arcana must be kept simple and clean in their design, so that they are easy to remember. The complexity of the representation is not a proof of its validity, power, or efficacy. The PSYCHIC PRACTigj i purpose is to activate the caniJ mind in a meaningful way. � of memories.

The PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING 77 purpose is to activate the card mentally by adding information to the mind in a meaningful way. To do this, you may use your storehouse of memories. This is a very unique process because, in Western soci­ety, memory is rarely used. It is clear that everyone has this ability to varying degrees. However, if you have some difficulties with memo­rization, do not be concerned. At the beginning of your training, it will not be necessary to learn every detail of the picture or even of the details of the divinity by rote memorization. Routine practice with the Arcana will help you to memorize these details naturally and pro­gressively. The second step is internal. You will activate (give life) to the card by using an inner mental process. This involves putting your purpose, your intention, into the card, by putting yourself in the picture. You will no longer be a spectator or witness; you will project yourself into the card and become an actor in the scene. With frequent practice, the Arcana will become a real gate, which can then be opened into another world. You will learn how to cross this threshold and visit this new dimension; in other words, you will discover what is on the \"other side of the mirror.\" This technique allows you to leave the physical realm and use a simple mental representation to achieve real spiritual travel. The Tarot Arcana will be part of your inner reality . When you have visited all twenty-four gates via the Arcana, you will have mastered the first part of your relationship with these cards. It is very important to distinguish between \"astral projection\" and \"astral splitting.\" In the latter case, the astral body (the invisible part of your being) leaves the physical body to travel to another plane. In other words, in astral splitting the lower part of the astral body leaves the physical body, which then falls into a kind of deep unconscious sleep. Astral projection (which is what you would be using with the Arcana) is different because it involves a splitting of the higher level of the invisible bodies, and this \"projection\" and the \"out of body\" experience associated with it does not involve a loss of consciousness. The third step and final step involves using meditation to modify external reality. Once you have created the mental representation of an Arcanum and used astral projection to travel around in its world,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"78 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING you will achieve an identification with both the divinity this card rep­resents and the card's particular realm. This is the first stage toward consciously using the energy of the Tarot. Once this is accomplished, you will be able to invoke the power of each Arcanum and its associ­ated divinity. You will be able to use this process in your life so that you can use your will to direct this energy to influence material real­ity. This ability to affect external reality is really a consequence of your inner work. The precise directions for using these three steps will be given in the section on practical applications, in Part Six. Be applying these techniques regularly, you will be able to make step-by-step progress toward the completion of the Tarot. These advanced practices imply the use of processes and rituals that are the result of our oral tradi­tion. They will allow you to integrate these powerful and magnificent worlds more actively and efficiently into your inner reality. As you use these symbols and myths, you will be able to better understand and complete your magical personality. RITUAL WORK A ritual must not be considered as something that logically follows those steps in sequence. A ritual is a practice that combines all the previously explained aspects, and uses visualization as a vector for en­ergy. By using visualization as a vector for energy, you will have access to more power, and your ritual will have more impact and effective­ness. However, before proceeding further into the use of rituals, it is important to provide some particulars regarding the real nature and function of a ritual. As previously described, every divinity of the Arcana is repre­sented by a set of symbols that may be used in your practices (ac­cording to their correspondences). These rituals and related training processes will involve all the levels of your personality. This is how a ritual is defined, as a process that involves every level of your person­ality. Thus you can see that a ritual is not a religious behavior. ' PSYCHIC PRACTI� However, a ritual is not j iJie level.

This is how a every level of your person­a religious behavior. PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING 79 However, a ritual is not just composed of the elements on the vis­ible level. The visible elements of a ritual are simply the outer rep­resentation of an inner process. When you meditate, the process of meditation is accomplished on the mental level. In your imagination, you mentally act, move, talk, etc. It is from this mental reality that the physical reality can be modified. A ritual is initially an aid to help you modify external reality. Every symbol and element of which this rep­resentation is composed stimulates the senses to make the represen­tation of the divinity come alive for you. This ritual inner activation of the representation of the divinity is more effective after the inner work I described previously. By combining the inner and outer work, you will be able to enrich your self-understanding and self-transfor­mation. Also, once you understand these elements, you will be able to use the Ta rot to accomplish your individual work. The symbols used in your rituals have their own independent power. In other words, their power is not entirely dependent on your ability to sense them, as you do with physical reality. Obviously, the essential part of the action of these symbols takes place in your psyche, but (additionally) they have their own power, which is the re­sult of their construction, form, independent action, etc. I offer the following two examples in order to clarify this aspect. The first example is perfume. When you use a specific perfume during a ritual, this smell will interact with your senses and your feel­ings. The fragrance will have an impact on your psyche. However, at same time, anyone whose nose works properly can smell this perfume and can also be affected by its smell. A perfume is not a neutral object. It has real qualities that are distinct from the use you make of it in your rituals. The gestures associated with the Arcana constitute another example. (In the next chapter of this book, there will be more information on these gestures.) These gestures were developed by the past masters of the Ogdoadic Tradition3 in order to use specific feelings that become 3. See Planetary Magick by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips (Woodbury, MN: Llewellyn Publications, 1989) for more information."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"80 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING ingrained in our corporeal structure and which then have the ability to act deeply on our psyche. When you perform a specific gesture, your whole body feels the special character of this gesture. When you under­stand the esoteric use of gestures, you can begin to see that movements of the physical body may be used to create results on the invisible levels, both in your psyche and in the external world. CREATIVE VISUALIZATION Visualization is a totally natural process which comes from the imagi­nation. You use visualization all day long without being really con­scious of this process. Your thoughts frequently wander, meandering from one to another, and it is very difficult to stop this process. If you spend even a short time pondering your own thinking process, it will immediately become apparent that your mind is not in control of this flow, and that you really have a problem focusing on one point. When you finally succeed in arresting the flow, it is (unfortunately) usually because of something negative that gets your attention. Therefore, it is important for you to understand that you do not create these thoughts, and, since you didn't choose them, you cannot easily con­trol them. This is also true for positive thoughts. To understand more about how creative visualization works, you must become aware of a specific natural process: your psyche has an important influence on your physical body and your life. If you think about your personal history for a few moments, you will find a great deal of evidence of this association between your psyche and your daily existence. The most common manifestation of this asso­ciation may be found in the effects of thought on the physical body. Your body may exhibit specific symptoms that are a somatization of a thought having its origin in your mind. For example, when you feel very sad and melancholy, the effect on your body will manifest as a physical depression: you will be \"dead tired,\" be more sensitive to stress, get headaches more frequently, suffer insomnia, or want to sleep all the time.

The association between visualization and external events is not immediately evident, and this disconnect in time tends to make the connection harder for you to recognize. Yet, when you comprehend the real nature of this visual ability, you will immediately recognize the extraordinary advantage in controlling and using it. In order to use visualization, you must focus your thoughts on a precise pur­pose and use your mind, desire, and will toward the same end. This is a natural process, which can be used immediately by nearly any­one. Most of us are still victims of spontaneous visualization, but it is surely better to take control of this potent force and then to direct it to be congruent with our conscious intentions. While this is not a book about creative visualization, you will be using this technique as part of your work with the Tarot. One of the principal purposes of this book is to teach you how to use visualization techniques to harmonize your psyche. Therefore, visualization will be an important part of your daily practice, and its control will be funda­mental to your success in ritual. To help you succeed, I will now provide some important guidelines for successful creative visualization. It is not initially necessary for you to have complete and accom­plished control of your visualizations. As with all things, you will de­velop skill with practice. There are many possibilities for, and beneficial uses of, creative vi­sualization. When you use creative visualization properly, it is possible to control your life, to be more focused, and to channel your energy in a precise direction. The primary goal is to learn how to control your mind so you can control your creative visualizations. In order to learn to control your mind and your creative visual­izations, it is a good idea to begin by choosing an objective because this action focuses your will. Next, you will bring this objective to life with the energy of your desire for the outcome you chose. Then you will need to associate your visualizations with your chosen goal, and, finally, you must take action to accomplish this goal. By using this simple process, you involve every part of your being in the work, so"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"82 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING that your conscious and unconscious are able to work in harmony to accomplish your goal. In working with the Tarot, the proper use of creative visualization allows you to integrate the divinities and sym­bols present in the different Arcana in a living form. The first step is concentration. You must train yourself so that you can concentrate on a specific representation (Arcanum) for a speci­fied length of time. In order to do this, you must picture the Arcanum in your mind, generally and also in minute detail. Up to this point, the process is just the same as using your imagination to visualize the card. However, the purpose of visualization is not only to establish a specific representation in your mind, but to activate the symbols present in the desired Arcanum. You must remember that the symbols you see in the Arcanum are also present as archetypes in your uncon­scious. Visualization activates the symbols comprising the Arcanum while establishing a real and effective link between the card and the archetypes in your unconscious. This process ensures that your work on the Arcanum will be accomplished inside you, on the inner planes. This connection will activate your inner world in a coherent, precise, and effective way. Each of the twenty-four Trumps, with its precise design and char­acter, will establish a specific order inside of you. These mental rep­resentations will be constituted inside you, as you use the Arcana in this way. It does not matter which Tarot deck you use for this process. However, the Aurum Solis Tarot will generally help you to accomplish this goal much more quickly. The second step will be the actual observation of a specific Arca­num and the symbols that comprise this representation. It is impor­tant to be attentive to the aesthetics as well as the details. It is best to engage your active curiosity when you do this, and use your curios­ity to look carefully at the different aspects of the card: the colors, the minute details, any magical words that might be associated with this card, etc. Use everything that your imagination suggests to stimu­late your curiosity regarding every aspect of the card. The ability to observe in this way is a fundamental aspect of your ability to learn. However, this is not a fruitless intellectual exercise.

You must become infused with the divine representation that is the object of your scrutiny. Whether your eyes are open or half closed, you must remember that the two funda­mental elements of visualization are observation and curiosity. The next step is to form a mental representation of what you have seen and observed in the card. At this point, you should close your eyes and mentally recreate the card. This process is not as difficult as you might imagine. In fact, this is a natural process that you use con­stantly in your daily life. How many times have you thought about a distant friend or a faraway place you long to revisit? The process you will be using in this book is exactly the same as recalling your friend or bringing up the memory of that far-off locale. At the beginning, your inner vision will start out with a broad overview, and you may experience some problems focusing on the details. This is normal. The most important step is just to begin using the visualization tech­nique because you will inevitably improve with practice. The next step will be to utilize relaxation in conjunction with cre­ating a symbolic story or a description to which you can add, point by point, until the entire mental representation is complete. Be care­ful about this step; it is crucial to remain relaxed. Visualization must always be dynamic. Tension negates the process. Begin by associating your visualization with your respiration so that it flows naturally, rhythmically. In this way, work on memorizing the details of the card while you are relaxed in a chair or lying on the floor. You might record the description of the Arcanum and read the text during your period of relaxation. You might also ask someone to read this description to you. It is not necessary to maintain this intense focus for long periods during your visualization practice. Gradually, over time, you will be­come increasingly comfortable with these exercises, and you will be able to do them for longer periods without strain. Initially, the key element is to concentrate attentively on the details of the card during the period set aside for your meditation, rather than trying to sustain long periods of meditation."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"84 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING FROM EVOCATION TO INVOCATION It is important to clearly distinguish what is meant by the terms \"evo­cation\" and \"invocation.\" \"Invocation\" is making contact with a di­mension that is normally not a part of your consciousness or reality. \"Evocation\" is a mental process arising from your imagination, and evocation has no direct link with manifest reality. Your goal in the previously described exercise should be to consciously use the visual­ization and creative imagination process I just outlined. In the context of a conversation, your goal is to use evocative Ian­guage to help the person to whom you are speaking have the under­standing of your experience. Let us give the example of a past scene you are describing to the listener, which is something from your storehouse of memory. In order to convey this memory intelligibly, you must remember it, animate it, bring it into the present, and then transform this memory into an effective reality, even though it is re­ally something from the past. When you describe this historical mo­ment to your listener, you must describe the constituent elements of that memory in order to create an inner reality for your listener. If the description you use is very evocative, the inner reality of your in­terlocutor will be as powerful as your own. The process of evocation should be used to animate a memory. Hypnotists use precisely this technique of evocation. Their goal is to trigger a state of\"trance\" by the evocation of sensations related to a natural phenomenon. Whatever you evoke (if you do it correctly) will become real for the recipient. Of course, it is not necessary for you to relive this experience in order to make it evocative for your listener. This type of exteriorization and creation will be an external event, both for you and for your listener. There is no doubt that an orator's power of conviction, strong character, vocal intensity, animated gestures, intense concentration, and many other similar aspects may enhance or detract from this process. In the Tarot techniques you will be using, evocation will be used internally. The goal is to animate, or give life to, the Arcana and the divinity of each card.

Now you can begin to see how important your imagination and memory are to the process of evocation. With practice, these rituals animate and give a greater sense of depth to the Arcana. Rituals also open a gate to a new world. That world may be symbolic or emo­tional, but it is inevitably an aspect of the character of the divinity. Evoking an Arcanum activates it in your psyche and transforms it into a real portal into another world. Think of the looking-glass in the well-known story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll as a analogy for the Arcanum. In group work, evocation may be used in the same general way that hypnosis is used. However, the group leader must not attempt to control the minds of the participants. The ethics of your work must be strictly applied, as this will influence both the quality of the ex­perience and the outcome. The only ethical and permissible purpose of the art of evocation is to animate the world of the Ta rot in the psyche of the participants. The contribution of the personal qualities that each person brings to the process is unique and also fundamental to the success of the system. Your ability to make a good evocation is dependent upon your ability to make a clear mental representation of the Arcanum. This same ability will help you to establish a faster and more effective psychic link between your psyche and the divin­ity that corresponds to the Arcanum. Anyone can develop this ability with practice. Some of the practices you will be learning utilize a kind of logical progression. You may begin simply, and then add various elements to your performance, such as sounds, perfumes, etc. These elements, when added precisely at the right moment, are capable of greatly in­creasing the power of evocation. I will outline their use here and dem­onstrate their proper use during the work on the Tarot. When this new reality of the Ta rot is integrated into and becomes a real part of your psyche, you will be able to evoke its worlds much more easily. This will enable you to use the power of the Tarot much"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"86 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING more effectively. Remember that the goal of this work is to give life to a symbolic divine representation inside of you. Once that is accom­plished, whenever you use the Tarot, no matter the circumstances, the cards will not be just colored cardboard, they will be a living reminder of a world you know exists inside of you. Imagine the difference be­tween someone who evokes a country they only watched on television versus the evocation of someone who actually visited the same coun­try. The former only has flat descriptions and secondhand knowledge, while the latter has rich memories, vivid details, and intense experi­ences that give true life to his or her memory. Words without passion, words that are not fleshed out, will never evoke the depth of response that will be evoked by someone who has smelled the smells, tasted the tastes, and experienced cuts and bruises in that other country. Most books on the Tarot offer you the classical, theoretical teachings. From my perspective, these are dry and lifeless. I will certainly give you the theoretical elements, but I will also teach you how to bring these to life. There is also another complementary goal to the intention just outlined. That goal is to help you experience a traditional initiatic process by teaching yourself to project one's self into the Tarot world. Of course, critics may say that an initiation requires real and immedi­ate contact with the initiator, and this is true. However, the advanced techniques I am offering you in this book will permit you to progress step by step toward the integration of this system. The effect of initiation is a real progress toward and realization of the completion of your inner self. This process will not transform you into a different person. As Nietzsche said, \"Become what you are!\" Ini­tiation helps you to overcome what was suppressed or smothered in you, so that your abilities, gifts, and powers blossom and you become enlightened. However, initiation alone is not adequate to the task of accomplishing all of this. In order to effectively accomplish your self­realization, you must utilize invocation, which is active and energetic. The process of invocation explicitly employs contact with a di­mension that is not normally a part of your consciousness and real­ity.

Invocation allows you to cre­ate a simple but very real ritual to accomplish the link with the Angel of the Tarot. In order to understand how invocations function, you must consider certain aspects of that process. It is obviously easier to analyze something that has a direct effect on the psyche. The gestures used in ritual are an excellent example of this. Evocation, by itself, is limited to the mental plane. Invocation is not limited in this way. Of course, evocation can be a very powerful tool. However, its ef­fectiveness depends on regular practice and the ability to concentrate effectively, which varies from person to person. To make the Arcana an inner reality, you must use invocation to intensify this inner world, just as you use gestures to intensify rituals. Oral tradition has trans­mitted numerous elements that strengthen the basic work. It tells you that no movement is ever insignificant. You should certainly recog­nize this same principle at work in your daily life. The same is true in your work with the Tarot. The gestures you use are precise, codi­fied, and assembled in such a way that each one has a precise effect on a specific part of your body. When you use such a gesture in the context of a ritual setting, it becomes impregnated with the energy of the Arcanum and it will have a specific impact on the body part it is associated with. Deep reservoirs of your psyche will be stimulated and activated. The end result of that process is that you will achieve a new understanding of the divinity and the Arcanum with which it is associated. Hopefully, I have clarified the distinct difference between invocation and evocation. It will be readily apparent that you may use differing aspects, such as gestures, colors, sounds, etc., and that each element will add to and increase the power and potency of your evocations. By con­trast, invocation is not limited to these deep levels of the being. Each card also corresponds to a power extant in the universe, in the outer invisible world. It is difficult to know whether these powers predated the Tarot and guided its manifestation, or whether they appeared after the Tarot was created. Whatever the truth may be, it will not affect our usage of the Tarot. An external invisible reality does exist; invocation"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"88 PSYCHIC PRACTICES FOR TAROT TRAINING will create an effective link between your unconscious and this invisible dimension that you invoke. By using the right words, it is possible to invoke the power of these different planes, but I will briefly explain here that these invocations are theurgic in nature. The use of the Tarot keys allows you to act on and affect the invis­ible planes. In the next few chapters, you will learn how to do that using these theurgic rituals, which are the beginning of a genuine ini­tiatic process. Group evocations will also be taught. In this regard, an individual ritual may be adapted for use with several participants, or you may prefer working under the supervision of someone who has already developed control and has experience producing effective re­sults with these practices. When an experienced magus works with several participants, it increases the power of evocation. However, I recommend that you initially begin working with the individual prac­tices, so that you may develop a relationship with each Arcanum. Let us not forget that the power of evocation is of itself very important. When you develop an individual relationship with the Arcana before working in a group, you avoid being in a passive receptive position, in which the group leader might unintentionally influence you in a di­rection that is not really appropriate to that Arcanum. Thus, I strongly recommend that you complete the individual practices before starting group ritual work. CONTACT WITH THE EGREGORE AND WORKING WITH THE ENERGIES Energies are an extremely complex concept, so it is important to ad­dress some issues related to energies before proceeding. The goal of this book is not to deepen your understanding of these complexities; rather, you will be focused on how and why you can use them. The traditional teachings of the Far East and Middle East tell us that the human being is composed of two dimensions, the physi­cal and the nonphysical.

In this regard, it is important to keep two things in mind: ( 1) the very important work of legitimate para­psychologists who confirm this phenomenon; and (2) the absence of proof is not proof of the invalidity of the subject under study. In com­ing years, the experimental verification of the realities within the vari­ous currents of this tradition should prove very interesting indeed. Prior to the realization of experimental evidence, the practice of med­itation and the use of the techniques presented in this book may be used to control energy and affect material reality; such evidence will allow you to achieve validation on a personal level. To that end, I use the Tarot as the guide to theory and practice."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"PARTTHRLL THL SACRED MAPS"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE QABALAH, FROM GRLLK TOHLBRLW THE TREE OF LIFE Contrary to popular belief, the Qabalah is, in itself, quite simple. As with any training, it is necessary to learn the Qabalah in progressive steps, moving, as Descartes taught us, \"from the simplest to the most complex.\" The Tree of Life, or Sephirothic Tree, is one of the foundations of this training. The Tree of Life may be utilized in numerous ways, but, in this context, you will limit your use of the Tree to its corre­spondence with the Universal Man, also called the Perfected Man. The diagram symbolically represents the different steps or phases of the creation of a human being, whose occult structure is composed of spheres of energy and the paths between them. Moreover, it is clear that there is an intimate relationship between the Tarot and the differ­ent elements of the Tree of Life. When you first look at this diagram, it may seem quite complex.

You will soon see how easy it is to use in ritual work with the Tarot. The ten Sephiroth are the fundamental structure of the Tree of Life. Every Sephirah is a dynamic mode of being, and its character is primarily expressed by its relationship with the other Sephiroth and secondarily by its relationship to other beings. The relationships among the Sephiroth are the symbolic and synthetic representations of the universe and the Universal Being. This map of the universe will be more complete if I include the Four Worlds (Atziluth, Briah, etc.). The Qabalah has an extensive history that offers us different repre­sentations of the Qabalistic Tree; the one I have shown you here is the version I will be using with the Tarot system, as it is the one most well-known in the Western Hermetic Tradition. Every Sephirah has a specific name, and it manifests itself to us by its particular qualities or through the symbols of its qualities, down through the Four Worlds. This archetypal structure is a representa­tion symbolized by spheres, which exist in the Four Worlds described by the Qabalah as well as the macrocosmic and microcosmic planes. I shall begin by presenting each of these spheres, or Sephiroth, starting from the spiritual beginning of the existence of the world at its highest spiritual level (Kether). Emanation originates with the first Sephirah. The energy flows down from there to each subsequent Sephirah in a precise order that is self-correcting and self-balancing. There is also a movement of energy in the opposite direction, as en­ergy also rises up the Tree from the lowest sphere (Malkuth) to the highest sphere (Kether). • The first sphere to manifest itself is the highest one; it is called Kether. This sphere is the original and archetypal manifestation of divinity. It is a pure concentration of luminous energy poten­tially containing all that is to come. It is a perfect unity.

This system (using the planets, astrological signs, ele­ments, Greek letters, and Hebrew letters to organize the arrangement of Tarot cards on the paths of the Tree of Life) is an original creation of the Hermetic Tradition. But, in order to use this system effectively, you must remember that the numbers on the paths have no special meaning and are just used as a marker (indicating the position of the cards on the Tree of Life). Keeping these points in mind will enable you to remember the right sequence of cards for the practices and rituals offered in this book. The purpose of drawing these correspondences between the Qa­balah (whether Greek or Hebrew) and the Tarot cards is to expand the Figure 16: The Hermetic Tree of Life-the planets.

These as­sociations give you a frame of reference that permits you to use the keys to connect with both personal and cosmic consciousness. I have also discussed the importance of associating the symbolism of astrol­ogy with the Tarot, including planetary influences, zodiacal signs, and the symbols of the divinities. These additions will improve the accu­racy and effectiveness of your use of the Tarot. I may say that this fusion of symbolism, the Qabalah, and the Tarot has a doubly advantageous effect. The Qabalah and the Tarot are mutually enriched by this synthesis, although it is possible that Jewish and Christian Qabalists may disagree with these affirmations. To most dogmatic Qabalists, the Tarot has nothing to do with the tradition of the Qabalah. However, our inspiration and intention in making these associations comes from our predecessors in the Ogdo­adic Tradition of the Renaissance, which predates this criticism. As an heir of the Golden Chain of the Initiates who composed this wonder­ful system, I am eternally grateful for and impressed by its power, as well as its many effective practical applications in daily life. I will now speak in more depth about this notion of reciprocal improvement. The Tarot is a set of cards representing symbolic pic­tures (or gates) that help connect you to different states of conscious­ness. When you first pick up a deck, particularly most of the common decks that are currently available, it probably appears that the Qa­balah is more focused on the intellectual mind, rather than connected to what we described earlier as \"the imaginary realm.\" However, the intention of the creators of the Tarot was not to give an intellectual focus to your study; it was rather the opposite. Therefore, the cards I offer you in this book are symbols that accomplish the original inten­tion of the creators of the Tarot. With this in mind, you will now begin a surprising journey into the use of the real Tarot of the Hermeticists of old. Once you take up these keys and begin to study them, you will very surprised at how easy it is to understand the Qabalah. As you progress, you will find it"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"100 THE QABALAH, FROM GREEK TO HEBREW very exciting to associate the theoretical and symbolic elements of the Qabalah to the extraordinary imagery of the divine Tarot. Up to this point, I have only been discussing the study of the Tarot and some initial training in its use, both of which are rather theoreti­cal and symbolic tasks. These aspects are important to your use of the Tarot, but it is equally important to your understanding and enjoy­ment of the Tarot that your use of it not be limited to these important but limited intellectual aspects. Figure 18: The Hermetic Tree of Life-numbering of the paths. It is a good idea to consider such fundamental issues as the meaning of existence, the goals and values that give meaning to your life, etc. The Qabalah is often shown as a grid, which may be utilized to help you understand the world. The Tree of Life dia­gram offers a standard of ethics and morality that helps you to find signposts and guidelines as you travel through your life in this great world. But you will discover that the Qabalah is not the only answer. The Tarot itself will offer you understanding, guidelines, and values, as well as theurgic and magical practices; sometimes the Tarot provides this informa­tion more precisely and easily than the Qabalah itself. I am not saying that the entire system of the Qabalah is equivalent to what you will find in the Tarot. However, one of the hidden objectives of the creators of the Tarot is identical with a particular aspect of the Qabalah as realized in this century; Tarot was intended to provide specific advantages to its users.

Of course, there is a spiritual and religious dimen­sion to the Tarot, but this aspect of the Tarot is more tolerant, and it emphasizes the quest for the Creator of the Universe and the will to establish and maintain a dose and personal relationship with the divine. The initial step in the quest for a relationship with the creator is to make contact with the emanations of the divine that our initiated ancestors called \"the divinities.\" When you use the Greek words of power, you will be able to establish this contact without the dogmatic influences that have become associated with the Qabalah. When you start using these rituals, you will immediately see that these original practices result in an enormous difference in the powers you will be able to invoke and use. You will realize that you are immediately dose to divine origins. THE TAROT: GATE OF THE QABALISTIC PATHS The Tree of Life has proven itself to be a very interesting element of the Qabalistic system. It is a pattern, which is at once both extremely complex and very simple. It represents the Universal Man (Adam Kadmon, the Adam of the biblical myth of the creation), the first being created by God. As you read in the text of the Bible, ''And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them\" (Genesis 1:27). Th e Qabalah mani­fests this principle by creating a link between the Tree of Life and the pattern of the archetypal body of the human being in its completed form. In this book, I will use the Tree of Life in two different ways: the first will be as a representation of the archetypal body, and the second will be as a link to the different states of consciousness that are neces­sary to accomplish your goals and complete your inner nature. If you are interested in continuing your investigation of the Tree of Life and the Qabalah, you may find it helpful to begin by referencing the books listed on the Aurum Solis website (www.aurumsolis.info/)."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"102 THE QABALAH, FROM GREEK TO HEBREW Figure 19: The Hermetic Tree of Life-the sacred Greek letters. First Aspect The pattern on the Tree of Life can be overlaid on your physical body, with the paths and spheres corresponding to different parts of the body. This connection gives you several indications for the use of the Major and Minor Arcana. (I will develop this point further in the next chapter.) On the other hand, each path and each sphere corresponds to a planet, to an astrological sign, or to an element. Tr aditional astro­logical symbolism provides you with precious indications about the correspondences between planets, signs, elements, and the different parts of the body. It is because of these correlations that you are able to establish a usable, direct, and coherent relationship with the divine in your practical work.

The density of the material level surrounded the living soul, creating something like a darkness or shadow around it.

THE QABALAH, FROM GREEK TO HEBREW of Life, so that you achieve the illumination of your being. To accomplish this, you must per­form a kind of work on each path, in order to make that path (or state of consciousness) alive and active in you. Then you must work to inte­grate that level of consciousness into your psyche and learn to manage the powers that are con­nected with that level. The understanding of these paths and the logical sequence of the as­cension of these paths will enable you to attain this awakening. This awakening is what we have referred to as \"the initiation into the Qabalah\" or (more pertinently here) the \"initiation into the Tarot.\" Here it is important to remember that the Major Arcana corresponds to the different paths. The magical work performed using each card corresponds exactly with the work that must be accomplished to ascend the Tree of Life. For example, if you meditate or work ritually on the last card (Kronos-Death), it allows you to as­cend the path that links Yesod to the solar sphere of Tiphareth. I want to remind you that each path, as well as each sphere, exists on the four planes of manifes­tation (which I will talk about in the next section). Each plane of manifestation will consequently re­quire the use of specific sacred names and specific colors that are attributed to that plane. In practi­cal work, you will find that it will sometimes be more useful to work specifically on one particu­lar plane (and this will be explained as you prog­ress).

THE FOUR WORLDS In the Hebrew Qabalah, the universe is divided into four worlds: As­siah (the material plane), Yetzirah (the astral plane), Briah (the men­tal plane), and Atziluth (the Divine plane). It is possible for you to establish a relationship between these invisible realms of external ex­istence and the structure of your personality. I will now provide a short description of each plane. Assiah-The Material World Assiah corresponds to the physical world, and it is the most physical, most dense, plane. Assiah is the material manifestation of the pow­ers of the upper worlds. You may be surprised by the complexity and apparent chaos of this world because it does not appear to emanate from an ordered and elegant inner structure. Yet, as you know, ap­pearances can be deceiving. In reality, an ordered structure really does exist, even though it is hard to see through the veils of illusion. In order to pierce that veil, it is necessary to become sensitive to the con­cepts and ideas that are the support and origin of the world you see around you. By utilizing this process, and looking for these origins, you will make contact with these divine planes. In the human microcosm, Assiah is related to the physical organ­ism, to subatomic structures, to the atomic and molecular levels of existence. Yetzirah-The Astral World Yetzirah corresponds to the astral world, which is distinct from As­siah. In a sense, Yetzirah is the energy that supports the physical world (from which the physical world emanates); it is the origin of the world of appearances in which you live. Everything that occurs in the physical world takes place in Yetzirah first. However, Yetzirah is subject to modifications, and remains indeterminate and changeable."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"106 THE QABALAH, FROM GREEK TO HEBREW It is the recipient of an abundance of pictures emanating from Assiah, many of which constitute your emotions. In the human microcosm, Yetzirah relates to the unconscious inferior body, to the energetic body called the Nephesh. Briah-The Mental World Briah corresponds to the world of creation, which contains the ar­chetypal pictures of creation but not the archetypes themselves. The mental world contains the pictures of the realities that are visible to anyone who is able to perceive this plane. It is necessary to differ­entiate those pictures that manifest themselves in Briah from those pictures that are part of the world of Yetzirah. In Yetzirah, there are numerous changeable pictures that have their origin in the emotions associated with Assiah. In Briah, the pictures are the lower reflection of the archetypal realities of Atziluth. In the human microcosm, Briah is related to rational consciousness, the energies of being, and the body called Ruach. Atziluth-The Divine World It is in the divine world that the au-thentic archetypes can be found. Only in the world of pure abstrac­tion are you able to see into the ar­chetypal representations of the ten spheres. The seven planets, which are connected with these spheres, are symbolically represented in the de­sign known as the Tree of Life.

Above these Four Worlds, Qabalists say there is something called the \"veils of negative existence,\" which are: Ain Soph Aur: infinite light; Ain Soph: the infinite; and Ain: the no-thing . PRINCIPLES OF THE SACRED LANGUAGES Tradition teaches us that some alphabets have a power and a value that exceeds their secular, everyday usage. This is the case for ancient languages such as the Chaldean language and Egyptian hieroglyphs; it is true of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets and languages. Four essential principles must be kept in mind before using these languages: 1. Each letter is a symbol that is related to an invisible reality; 2. Each letter has a hidden meaning; 3. Each letter corresponds to a numerical value, which allows you to understand its deeper meaning; 4. Each letter is associated with a unique sound and a specific en­ergy linked to a specific divinity. Historically, the Greek alphabet was undoubtedly the first to be used in this kind of study and esoteric analysis, as many passages of Pythagoras and Plato demonstrate. Although the Greek language con­stitutes the reference language for all Hermeticists, the progression on the Tree of Life (or the ascension on the way of return) is the same whether you use the Greek or the Hebrew Qabalah. Since the Hebrew Qabalah is the most widely known and used system today (in the Western Tradition), in the next few chapters I will use it to clarify this progression. Please remember that everything that I will be explaining about the Hebrew language also applies to the Greek alphabet."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"� � � � :I: 0 E-< :.: � � � \" ::11 0 � � i < Jo-'1 < � < Cl � :I: E-< 00 0 ..... � § 81 zr-.

When it is written as \"ADOM,\" 01�, the word means \"red.\" The"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"110 THE QABALAH, FROM GREEK TO HEBREW word \"ADAMA\" written as i10j� (Genesis 2:7) \"the globe, the ma­trix.\" Thus you notice that, as the vowels are moved, or changed, even though the consonants remain the same, the meaning changes. In the current system, the vowel points are no longer shown, and thus a richness of interpretation is thereby permitted. Thus, ''ADAM\" could also mean \"red;' and you might superimpose various meanings to in­dicated hidden or a priori meanings. This is the first form of richness that the Hebrew language offers. Secondly, a word may also contain other words or roots of words, which you may profitably examine. Thus, in the preceding example, \"ADAM\" Cj� contains the word for \"DAM\" (\"blood;' C\"J). Also you may want to consider the possible union of meanings of the three words ''ADAM;' \"red,\" and \"blood.\" Consequently, I can say that Adam is the Universal Man because all men have red blood. From this the­ory, a moral teaching can be learned: when the blood of a man is spilt, it is the blood of all mankind that is spilt. This simple example shows us the depth of possibilities of such a study. Thirdly, as mentioned above, each letter represents a number, as Alef = 1, Bet= 2, etc. This attribute of Hebrew made it possible for a science to develop. This is an impressive revelation for some. For others it is incomprehensible. Indeed, this text and especially the first five books of the Bible can be seen as an allegory, the coding of a sci­ence. The Qabalah is thus the oral explanation transmitted from an­tiquity to our modern days. It is divided into three parts. Gematria, Notarikon, and Temurah are the three forms this system takes. Gematria consists of a system in which words having the same nu­merical values are compared or even considered to be equal in meaning. The traditional example of this is the word \"ONE;' (or \"UNITY\"), which is \"ECHAD\" (or ''A CHAD\") = 13. \"ONE\"= ''A CHAD\"= 11J� = 4 + 8 + 1 = 13. The word for \"LOVE\" is ''AHAVAH;' which also = 13. \"LOVE\"= ''AHAVAH\" = i1�1� = 5 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 13. Thus LOVE= UNITY. T -:-M. Horowitz says of Genesis 14:14 that, \"As soon as Abraham learned that his brother had been made a prisoner he armed 318 men. The bravest man servant of Abraham was Eliezer. The numerical value of the name Eliezer (11'1'\"?�) is exactly 318. Thus, when you a new word. The most ''AGLA'' (�?,�), whichi 'f, the sentence: \"Atah Gi powerful forever, Lord.\"' ters.

Thus, when you THE QABALAH, FROM GREEK TO HEBREW 111 see further references to 318 in the Bible, you may also understand that this represents the value of a number, and that it represents the value of the name Eliezer.\" Notarikon: The first letter of each word in a sentence comprises a new word. The most celebrated example of Notarikon is the word ''AGLA'' ( � '?) �), which is built from the first letters of the words in the sentence: \"Atah Gibor Leolam Adonai,\" which means \"You are powerful forever, Lord:' Temurah: This is the technique of the permutation of Hebrew let­ters. To accomplish permutation, in its simplest form, one replaces each letter by the letter that proceeds or follows it in the alphabet. Other such methods of permutation are based on more complex interrelations, which enable you to find deeper meanings of a word based on different planes of consciousness. And fourthly, another means of extracting meaning from the He­brew alphabet is by looking at the shape of the letter itself. It must be understood that this alphabet was considered by the Hebrews to be a divine revelation. The Hebrew alphabet comprises in itself the entire structure of the world. For example, Yod C) is a tongue of fire. The letter Samekh (0) represents the plane of the material world as it relates to the sphere of the senses, and the letter Shin (W) the spiritual plane or spiritual sphere. This sphere is sometimes painted as a sphere with wings, in flames (with flames surrounding it). The Zohar shows us an example with the letter Aleph.

The Aurum Solis Tarot is rooted in the Neoplatonic Tradition and the ancient Greek vision of the world. The Qabalistic interpre­tation was later added with the help of some simple representation of the Tree of Life. The divine Tarot is a representation of the divine world; therefore, all of the keys are connected to the divinities of what we call the divine archetypes. The system I unveil in this book will allow you to see clearly the synthesis and the connections with the an­cient mysteries and the operative work in the earlier Ogdoadic Tradi­tion. For example, you will see the Greek letters and their astrological attributions. It will be the same with the Hebrew letters. In this way, the divine representations will enable you to experience the eminently practical approach that the Aurum Solis heritage used. In order to get the most from the practices and rituals in this book, you will need to be familiar with the materials provided in the section on symbols and correspondences. Reading that section first will allow you to use this system immediately. After your initial experiments, you may return to those sections and study the remainder of the materials more deeply in order to enhance your knowledge and improve your ef­fectiveness in ritual.

Some of these gestures and movements were revealed in the book Planetary Magick but others, more connected with the Greek and Hebrew letters (as divinities themselves), are lesser known. Some symbolic elements of the cards have been used in the practi­cal parts of this book. The hymns are of varied origins. Some of the hymns come to us from the sacred texts of the Neoplatonic and Theurgic Tradition (the Orphic Hymns, for example), while others were written by past mas­ters of the Ordo Aurum Solis from the perspective of their personal studies, heritage, and meditations. ...

She can help you change the circumstances that bar you from realizing your goals. This Arcanum represents the unconscious part of your psyche. It is interesting to note that the Moon corresponds to different divinities that are frequently linked to these different phases. Thus, the Moon may be associated with both Artemis and Hecate. In her character, Hec­ate summarizes the characteristics of the Moon, the earth, the subterra­nean, and the realm of shadows. She is associated with magic, mysteries, and occult powers. She is the original power present in your uncon­scious that creates all mental forms and brings the manifest world into existence. This is a generative, dynamic, and motive power. Hecate corresponds to the power of the personality that allows you to realize things, to select an objective, and to have the energy to prog­ress to the goal. In a sense, this lunar aspect is a kind of\"naval vessel\" of the sky (a ship carrying news, commerce, etc. to all the countries of the world). She helps you to think about the relatedness of things; to move from one thing to the next and to see the relationship among things, ideas, and places that sometimes seem far apart. Hecate is a symbol of your memory, the sum of your experiences in their entirety. This ability to remember is a source of wealth, but it can also immobilize you if you stay stuck in the past. As a result of the fact that she represents both past and present in their entirety, she symbolizes the nourishing, maternal, and protective aspects of con­sciousness.

It is possible to use this Arcanum to call upon a higher part of your being, to ask it to reject that part of your nature that belongs to the \"old self\" you are trying to change. You can use this great power to help you to break free of whatever causes your difficulties. This Arcanum is paradoxical. At first, you may see it as a symbol of destruction. In fact, it symbolizes the moment when old, commonly held beliefs are broken and overturned. Very often this power is con­nected with the idea of destruction and the transformation of your personality and life. However, this destructive power must be under­stood as a simple force, which is very well explained in the Orphic Hymn. It is an instrument of attack, but also of defense. Ares allows you to conquer the invisible kingdoms and at the same time to defend yourself from negative attacks. Ares can defend you from your own internal devils as well as from external and real adversaries. Ares can therefore assist you on both the spiritual and the physical planes. This Arcanum represents the power of language, the power of the Word. These powers are veiled by darkness; they are only accessible to those who can accept the neutrality of the Mars force. When you set goals, you must always choose/select precise inten­tions, but they must be potent desires if you want to make progress toward your goal. Remember to analyze your goals and desires before you begin, and then choose that which is essential to you if you wish to succeed. The ability to persevere on a committed course to a single goal requires a long period of training. This Arcanum allows you to develop bravery, generosity, a true fighting spirit, energy, self-confidence, optimism, and pride in good work.

More advanced elements also exist regarding the use of these correspondences, which have only been transmitted through some oral traditions. I shall now explain how to put all this together into practice-the goal being to develop a better understanding of, and harmony with, these subtle energies. One puzzling element for the student of the Tarot is that, among the many books available on the subject, the correspondences given for the Arcana tend to vary. Such is the case, for instance, for the correspon­dences between the cards and the various parts of the physical human body. Of course, authors tend to use the same interpretation for certain essential points, but this is not even always the case. But if such cor­respondences have any value, one would expect that they remain the same across differing authors. So how can you select between one and another system of work? If you accept that some correspondences must 209"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"210 BASIC ELEMENTS be the right ones, how can you know which ones? Do these differences have real consequences on your work? As this situation can pose a problem for the rational student, it deserves some development here. I shall begin with some remarks about why such confusion in the interpretation has occurred, before explaining the approach I have adopted in this book. The many differences found among various authors are all rooted in an ignorance of the true nature of the Tarot, its origin, and the symbolic system it underlies. One first (but common) source of er­rors is a superficial, arbitrary interpretation of the Tarot of Marseilles, and especially the indirect relations between the cards of this deck and the signs or planets. Many of those who have tried to deduce a set of correspondences by merely looking at the images on the pictures ended up with an arbitrary interpretation of the meaning of symbols. Just because a skeleton appears on the deck of the Major Arcanum titled Death, one might be tempted to jump to the conclusion that it corresponds to the bones and its articulations, simply based on the fact that the drawing shows a skeleton. Unfortunately, this is a gross oversimplification, which does not take you very far. In other cases, these errors were due to the limited esoteric knowledge of the authors about topics such as the Qabalah, astrology, or alchemy. At the root of the problem is the widespread development of the \"exoteric\" use of the Tarot, which has paralleled the loss of the original sources. Although it might seem paradoxical, these differences in inter­pretations have not much consequence in practice for most users of the Tarot, who see it essentially as a divination tool. As such, what is needed is just a mental convention, and whichever correspondences are thereby being assigned to the cards of the Tarot are of little im­portance. In the absolute, one could decide arbitrarily that a given Major Arcanum corresponds to a specific organ, and apply the same approach for all the others. Once this convention is memorized, one shall be able to use the Tarot for divination purposes to answer ques­tions about, for instance, physical or health problems. Here, the prin­ciple of mental convention (which is the same used in divination with ============�--------·�-----------BAS� a pendulum or in dowsing) up shall be the right one for a Let us take the example o(;· tion of the previous exam being associated with the drawing, this Major Arcan source of the problem has be the right answer even symbolism of the Major mental convention been chosen, though it would stil bones.

Let us take the example of somebody suffering from poor health, who wants to find out what is really going wrong inside his or her body. Let us also assume that this person is using the mental conven­tion of the previous example, i.e., with the Major Arcanum of Death being associated with the skeleton. If, after carrying out a proper drawing, this Major Arcanum gets selected, this will mean that the source of the problem has something to do with the bones. This will be the right answer even though the underlying interpretation of the symbolism of the Major Arcanum might be faulty. Had a different mental convention been used, a different card would have then been chosen, though it would still have been the one corresponding to the bones. In divination, chance has nothing to do with the way in which the cards appear. From this, you could conclude that the confusion surrounding the various existing correspondences system of the Tarot is not so much of a problem. But this would be true only if you were to limit yourself to using the Tarot deck as a divination tool, with the cards being then nothing more than pieces of paperboard. However, I explained in the chapters before that the cards are also true pentacles. They have a real potency, which connect them to specific energies. If you adopt this esoteric perspective, an arbitrary system of correspondences is obvi­ously of no use. On the invisible plane, there exists one specific link between each card and a particular energy, and this link can only be approached through the proper symbolic key. Picking up a Major Ar­cana card corresponding to a given organ will create an immediate link between you and the related energy-or more exactly with the energetic dimension of such organ-on condition of course that you are using the right correspondence system! The elements presented in the following chapter, together with the correspondence table provided, shall help solve these questions without difficulties. They integrate the traditional knowledge men­tioned above. Obviously, the precise correspondences explained in this book do not exclude the use of the Tarot as a tool for divination,"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212 BASIC ELEMENTS even though you use it here for a different purpose. I shall develop all these aspects of divination in a special book specially connected to this original Tarot of the Aurum Solis. SEQUENCE OF PRACTICE When you first begin your inner work using the Aurum Solis Arcana, I recommend that you practice these rituals in a precise sequence, on a consistent schedule. This will maximize the efficacy of this system in balancing your personality. To ensure your practices are most co­herent, you must follow the sequence of Arcana provided in the list below. Once you have completed this sequence, there will be several possibilities regarding your practice schedule, which will be addressed after I describe the initial process. The ideal practice requires performing one ritual for each Arca­num with the spacing set so that there is a regular rhythm to your practice (daily, for example). If you choose a daily schedule, then you would complete the entire sequence in twenty-four days. If you decide to work every other day, then the entire sequence would be complete in forty-eight days. If you are unable to be this consistent (because of other factors out of your control), then strive for consistency, but make the practice fit your schedule, so that it meshes into your life and is workable for you. It is better to have an irregular practice than no practice at all! Once you have completed this entire sequence, you will begin the next phase, which is called \"the descent of the energy of Mezla.\" Once you have completed these two cycles, you will find that it reinforces and deepens your learning to repeat these two phases (the complete sequence, and then the descent of the energy of Mezla) sev­eral times. In this way, you will maximize your relationship with the Tarot cards and your understanding of them. you can be alone, so be alone so that you ments for practice are at night.

Your goal is to be alone so that you can relax and calm your thoughts. The best mo­ments for practice are the very early hours of the morning or very late at night. At these hours, the world seems to sleep and it is often easier to find a quiet space in which to work. Of course, the best moment for your personal practice is the one that you feel most comfortable with; even if your initial choice doesn't work out, with time and prac­tice you will find the right combination of timing and circumstances to accomplish this task. I suggest that you wear comfortable, relaxed indoor clothes that are not too tight and restrictive, as this would im­pede the natural circulation of vital energy that you will be working with. It is also important to feel healthy and relaxed. You will eventu­ally discover the right elements to include in your personal prepara­tion for this inner journey. Some people find that relaxing with a nice cup of herbal tea or taking a shower beforehand are practices that help soothe them and make this journey easier and more pleasurable. Choose whatever works best for you. When everything is prepared and the time is right, retire to the area you have set aside for the ritual. Remember to disconnect your phones and any other technological devices that might disturb you during your ritual. Make sure that there will be no other sources of disturbance. If you live with anyone else, make sure that they are aware of what you are doing and that they will not disturb you. If the doorbell rings, or someone knocks, you must ignore it. Make sure that you have taken care of any need to use the bathroom, or other physical needs, before you begin. In your workspace, you will require the following: your notebook, a small table where you will place your notebook, a chair or armchair, your Tarot deck, and the elements you have chosen to enhance the ritual. It is best not to have a mirror in front of you. If there is a mir­ror in your space, put a nice veil over it, to prevent the refraction of light into the room, which might be a distraction."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"214 BASIC ELEMENTS For the meditation and invocation, you will need: a white table­cloth, two candlesticks with two white candles (natural beeswax is best), matches or a lighter, and some incense (which will be used later). If you decide to use incense, it must be chosen by personal preference. Behind the table, put a chair or an armchair. To perform the ritual, the preparation is the same, but you will need a larger space so that you can make the required gestures. There may be specific elements that are required for each ritual, which must also be brought to the space prior to beginning the ritual. These vary according to the Arcanum used, and are not outlined here. These ele­ments are indicated in the section associated with each Arcanum. If possible, place your altar or table in the east and put your chair behind it, so that, when seated, you will be facing east. (If you don't know where east is, just use a compass.) RELAXATION When everything has been made ready, light the two candles, starting with the one on the right, then sit down. Make sure you are comfort­ably seated, and that your back is as straight as possible. Place your hands flat on your thighs, breathing quietly. Begin the relaxation pe­riod. Note that you will progressively learn to improve your ability to relax with frequent practice. The sequence of relaxation offered below may be used whereveryou happen to be, for relaxation in any circum­stance; it is also ideal to use prior to every practice. Relaxation is an important part of any work. It prepares your mind and body for the practices or rituals. Indeed, the stress of deal­ing with the novelty of any new activity, in conjunction with the desire to do your best, can add to your confusion and impede the concentration necessary to perform adequately. Therefore, maximum performance is achieved by progressive relaxation, associated with every practice or ritual and repeated regularly. If you are not familiar with these techniques, I recommend that you become skilled in re­laxation before beginning these practices. There are various methods available; I recommend you choose the easiest to learn. Please take this simple observation Now focus your heavy and limp, as if a as you imagine this body.

If you have never practiced relaxation, begin by learning that skill, then practice associating re­laxation with your Tarot exercises. This discipline will improve your success with the Tarot immeasurably. General Outline of Relaxation Initially, you may start lying supine on the floor. Once you have achieved a comfortable state of relaxation, seat yourself in your chair and adapt this practice to your seated posture. Prior to beginning, arrange your environment so that everything reflects the inner balance you are striving to achieve. Make sure the room is warm enough and that your clothes are comfortable and loose. Keep the lighting dimmed and any sounds muted (if possible). Stretch out on a firm surface on your back. Let your arms lie on the floor at your sides, loose and relaxed. Be attentive to your breathing; listen to your breath flow in and out. Watch your chest rise and fall. Remain quiet, breathing gently in and out. Breathe in through your nostrils and not your mouth. Notice the circulation of air through your body as it enters your nostrils, flows into your lungs (expanding them), and remains there for a while. Notice the flow as you exhale. Relax and quietly enjoy watching this flow for a while. Return to this simple observation from time to time during this exercise. Now focus your attention on your right foot. Imagine that it is heavy and limp, as if a soothing, gentle heat flooded through it. Even as you imagine this warmth flooding through you, it manifests in your body. You may mentally list each of the parts of your body, or you may shift your awareness to any area that is tense, and bring warmth and relaxation to that area. As soon as the feeling of this heaviness and warmth is realized fully in your foot, imagine it progressively moving up your right leg to your right hip. Bring the gentle warmth and heaviness to any part of your leg that is not yet heavy, warm, and relaxed. Tr y not to concentrate on any one area for too long, as that will stop the process of the relaxation. It is necessary to act simultane­ously as both actor and observer in this process."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"216 BASIC ELEMENTS Notice your breathing from time to time. Observe the movement of air in and out of your lungs, and then return to the visualization. Repeat the same process for your left foot and left leg. Notice your breathing again. Now think about your right hand. Imagine that your hand be­comes heavy, and that a gentle heat flows down it. Feel your fingers, the top of your hand, the palm of your hand, your wrist, the front of your arm, your right elbow; visualize the heaviness moving up to your right shoulder. Return regularly to the observation of your breathing. Move the heaviness to your left hand, your left arm, and up to your left shoulder. Attend to your pelvis, your belly, your back, your chest, and your neck. This visualization, this heat, this heaviness works with your breathing, which you continue to observe from time to time. Move your attention to your skull. Begin with your scalp, the top of your skull, and then bring the heaviness and warmth down the nape of your neck toward your back. Feel the heaviness there. Relax your face beginning with the roots of your hair at the top of your forehead; move down your face, down your forehead, eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, cheekbones, temples, cheeks, and chin. Go down your entire face one more time. End at the neck. Breathe easily and slowly. Now imagine that your body is heavy without being overly warm. Your entire body enjoys a gentle warmth and torpor. You are entirely relaxed. Observe your breathing and feel this deep pervasive calm. Visualize an ovoid of light, scintillating mist four inches thick and surrounding your whole body with a pretty, soft color. You are at its center. You feel light and relaxed. Attend to your breathing and no­tice how calm and light you feel. As you continue your meditation, the sensations intensify and you feel utterly weightless. Enjoy these sensations deeply without going to sleep. In some cases, you will feel like you are swinging in a hammock or floating in comfortably warm saltwater.

In that event, you will be seated in a chair when you complete the exercise. At this juncture, you will be able to globalize your relaxation by linking it mentally to a few rounds of breathing cycles, easily connecting the cycles to all the parts of your body. At this level of practice, you will also be able to call up this level of relaxation when you concentrate on your breathing. Recovery phase: Whether you are lying on the floor at the end of your first relaxation exercise, or seated in your chair, you may bring yourself back to awareness gradually. It isn't necessary to relax for extended periods. To accelerate the awareness of your physical body, breathe deeply and gently wiggle your toes and fingers. Take your time progressively activating your consciousness and stretching your body. Once you feel fully aware, you may resume your activities . Naturally, it would be easier to have the relaxation exercises con­ducted by someone who can describe the complete process in the ap­propriate tone of voice.

Activation of the Arcanum When you have completed the relaxation exercise, open your eyes and unveil the Arcanum that is on the altar in front of you. Don't worry about memorizing the details of this picture of the divinity. The most important aspect of this experience is his or her presence and the em­anations from the sacred names surrounding him or her. Maintain your state of relaxation and look at the divinity so that you can observe every part of this representation. Don't worry about memorization, just look closely at what you see. Be sure to relax your eyes and simply allow your eyes to wander over the picture without stopping on any particular point. From time to time, close your eyes and remember the Arcanum by recreating it in your mind. At first, it will rarely appear as a clear picture; it will take time before it is as clear as a photograph of a friend you might call up from memory. Initially, this step will be like just thinking about someone you know. Of course, your visualization will increase in precision with consistent regular practice of at least fifteen minutes per session. Close your eyes. Visualize the Arcanum in front of you, enlarged so that the divinity is the same size as you are. Know that this is no longer an external representation; you are looking at a real place. You stand on the threshold of this other world, looking into it. You notice that the divinity is a living being. Imagine that (in your mind) you rise and move one step into the landscape of this scene. Everything is bursting with life and color. The presence of the divinity is very strong, and the landscape that surrounds you is equally vivid.

It is best to perform an invocation after you have completed the evocation described above. This means that you can accomplish the first cycle of evocation and then begin the more intense invocation practice. Using this progression (from evocation to invocation) will result in a more deeply grounded ritual, as well as ensuring better contact with the divinities. Since you have already completed the in­tegration of the Arcanum into your psyche and you now wish to ac­tivate this power, it will not be necessary to employ all of the parts of the visualization practice in the invocation. It is important to note that if you have already achieved this kind of integration with the Tarot because of prior personal work, you may want to start directly with the invocation of the archetypes of the Tarot.

The practices of the union and integration of the divinities that I described in the previous chapter will enable you to enter the world of the Tarot, but you can also use its energies to harmonize your psyche. I have said only some words about the action of the Tarot on the physical level. This work of inner harmonization, which is accomplished under the influence and bless­ing of the divinities, begins on the invisible plane and then is extended throughout your entire being, beginning with the highest, most subtle levels, and ending with the densest, most material plane. So you can consider that this action has an indirect effect on the physical balance. So it's possible to imagine that the use of the Tarot can have a direct effect on the physical body. It will be the consequence of the action on the invisible plane. 233"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"234 PRINCIPLES OF THE RITUAL WORK But, as I explained, the cards have a real and direct power depend­ing on the character of the divinity. It is for this reason that you can accept the existence of an action that can create real effect in the vis­ible plane without the use of an intermediary. Once you have finished this practice of individual harmoniza­tion, or even without performing it, you can use directly the Arcana of the Tarot as active, energetic support for a precise purpose. You can choose three different actions: (1) action on the psyche, (2) psycho­logical action, and (3) physical action (which is outside the scope of this book). In these applications, the ritual work can be performed di­rectly for us, or for someone present in the ritual or far away. You can also perform the ritual in a group (as I do in seminars) for someone in the group or for somebody who is not present physically. Let us be a little more explicit with some examples. Let us imag­ine that you are in a period of your life in which you are trying to create personal projects. You are looking for new ideas and need to mobilize your creative imagination. Naturally, it is first necessary to make concretely all that is necessary. But then you can go further and use an inner level-energies that are working inside you without your control. For that, you will act on the deep planes of your unconscious. After analyzing the different charts, you will decide to use the Arca­num of Aphrodite, as she is the progenitor of new ideas. I am going to use one of the practices explained below that use different practical elements you already know. You will determine the day during which you must start this practice and perform the ritual one time or the corresponding number of times. The contact with the egregore and the energy linked to this Arcanum is progressively going to act in your psyche and increase your creative potential, helping you to develop your desired projects. Much more, you will have the feeling that this action goes further than your personal sphere and begins to transform the outer elements. Circumstances, conditions, the milieu in which you live, all will begin to modify in a way that may surprise you. However, you should not think that the number of practices is a guarantee of success.

CHOICE OF THE TAROT CARD FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTION The chart of correspondences provided earlier in the book will allow you to select a Trump according to a variety of objectives. One diffi­culty, though, is that in some cases different cards share similar goals. Some method is therefore needed to be able to select the best Trump for a given objective. One easy solution would be to look for some obvious visual ele­ments or symbols in the card, which would appear to be linked to the chosen psychological goals. But as I said before, such a simple ap­proach is fraught with pitfalls, because the true symbolic links are in most cases neither obvious nor apparent. In reality, an u�derstanding of these correspondences is not necessary for this work, as long as the correct method is being used. Nobody needs to become a scholarly expert in the theoretical and symbolic knowledge of the Tarot to be able to benefit from its powerful energies. A few examples shall help me illustrate the required approach. Let us assume that you want to work on improving your memory. For this purpose and based on the table of correspondence, you could chose either the Major Arcanum Hermes (if the goal is to help you to develop your effective use of memory) or the Major Arcanum Selene (if the goal is to increase your memory). • Memory (helps you to develop your effective use of memory) -Hermes • Memory (increases memory)-Selene This case is simple enough, but there are also situations in which both the primary goal, as well as the secondary goal, are the same (or very close)-for example, as shown below for the development of strength."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"236 PRINCIPLES OF THE RITUAL WORK • Strength (helps you when you need a quick boost in strength or energy)-Zeus (2nd aspect) • Strength of will (to increase strength of will )-Hellos In such situations, the basic rule for selecting the proper Arcanum is to identify in the proper chart whether the main correspondence of the each Trump is with a sign, a planet, or an element. The plan­etary cards must be chosen when some rapid impact-concentrated but of limited duration-is needed. At the opposite, the sign cards provide for slower but also longer lasting effects, and are therefore to be chosen when, for instance, some deep transformation of the per­sonality is sought. As for the three cards representing the elements, their action is of a more general nature, and they shall be used only as complement for a practice that follows one with a card corresponding to either a planet or a sign. Using the example of strength above, you will notice that the Major Arcanum Helios corresponds to a planet (sun) while the Major Arcanum Zeus (2nd aspect) corresponds to a sign (Leo). If you need rapid help, then the Major Arcanum Helios is the one to choose. But if you are looking more for an overall, long-term improvement in your strength capacity, Major Arcanum Zeus (2nd aspect) will be a better choice. In addition to this rule, you can also rely on divination to help you choose. Thus, when in doubt, you can pick up the few Trumps suggested by the correspondences tables, turn them over so that their faces are not visible any more, mix them, clear your mind, and select one. The card chosen shall be the most appropriate to your goal. You will also notice that in some practices, in particular the Rituak of the Birthday, the first choice of the Trumps will be entirely founded on divination. The rationale in this special case is that the selection must be based on your overall inner state at a given point in time, a very complex matter that cannot be approached through the patchy choice provided by a chart of correspondences. dences are straigh� sponding to the The rule in such 2 Water 3 Air 4 Fire"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"�ALWORK ' It a quick boost in strength or � �of will)-Helios g the proper Arcanum main correspondence an element.

The correspon­dences are straightforward, except in the case of the three cards corre­sponding to the elements, for which three different days are proposed. The rule in such cases is as follows. For example, if you were born on December 8, your sign is Sagittarius. Your day is Thursday. So if you want to work with the Major Arcanum Eros (Fire), the correct day will be Thursday. If the day of your astrological sign is one of the three proposed, you should select the first day in the list. For example, if your sign is Cancer and you want to work with Major Arcanum Gaia (Earth), you won't find your astrological day (Monday) in the list, and will therefore choose Friday-the first of the three days cor­responding to Earth.

The idea is that, as the various Tarot cards have associations with various hours during the day, selecting the right time can en­hance the power of your practice and hence its intended action. This being said, it important to remember that you are work­ing here on the archetypal levels of the Tarot, and it is not absolutely necessary to use a precise calculation. The traditional method of calculating the right time for magical practice is somewhat difficult for beginners, and in practice is necessary only in rare cases.

PRINCIPLES OF THE RITUAL WORK 239 In these correspondences transmitted over many centuries, you can observe that each hour is connected to one of the seven planets in traditional astrology. The same succession of correspondences be­tween hours and planets is repeated again and again, in the order: Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. The correspondence for each day uses the same regular symbolic system, with each day be­ginning with a different planet. The influence of the planet dominates the day in question."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"240 PRINCIPLES OF THE RITUAL WORK It is interesting to note that the seven-day week was adopted by the Greeks, whose own planetary names used the names of the Greek Gods; Ares, Hermes, Zeus, Aphrodite, and Kronos. The system was then adopted by the Romans in the first century BCE. Like the Greeks, they named the five planets after their own Gods; Mars, Mer­cury, Jove (Jupiter), Venus, and Saturn. The days of the week in Latin were: Dies Solis (Sunday), Dies Lunae (Monday), Dies Martis (Tues­day), Dies Mercurii (Wednesday), Dies ]avis (Thursday), Dies Veneris (Friday), and Dies Saturni (Saturday). In the Germanic languages, roughly similar Germanic Gods were later substituted for the Roman ones, namely Tiu (Twia) for Mars, Woden for Mercury, Thor for Ju­piter, and Freya (Fria) for Venus. Only Saturn was retained from the Roman pantheon. But by introducing the Germanic Gods, however, the symbolic link with the planets was broken, since the Germanic languages did not name the planets after their Gods. The English words \"Tuesday,\" \"Wednesday,\" \"Thursday,\" and \"Friday\" have lost the original relationship with the planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, something that did not happen with the Romance languages such as French, Italian, and Spanish. On the other hand, in English the word \"Sunday\" does have a link to the sun, while the association has been lost in French, Italian, and Spanish. You can understand how powerful this egregore can be and why these correspondences can be so valuable in your practices. Several systems of correspondence exist of proposing different se­quences for the planets. The one you are using here is the most wide­spread and certainly the oldest. It could appear somewhat arbitrary, and one may be forgiven for wondering whether it did come from serious metaphysics or mythological consideration. However, as with anything in life, \"the proof is in the pudding;' experience will validate the data, and this framework is in fact remarkably coherent with the Tarot system. It follows exactly the order of the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, in a downward sequence starting from Saturn (Binah) and going then to Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon.

The information can now be found easily on the Internet, going for instance to the weather-forecasting websites. Once the exact time of sunrise is known, you just need to add the number of corresponding hours to find your hour of practice. Let us illustrate this with an example. Let us assume that you live in Los Angeles, and want to do a practice on August 1, 2010. Going to a website such as http://www.sunrisesunset.com/usa/, you will find that the exact time of sunrise at your place is 6:04AM. Let us also as­sume that you want to work with the Major Arcanum Poseidon (Pi­sces). This Major Arcanum corresponds to Thursday, so you should look for the hours corresponding to Jupiter. Since this day is a Sun­day, you have a choice between the 6th, the 13th, and the 20th hours, which start respectively just after noon, at 7:04PM, and at 2:04AM the following day (for the purpose of your work, this is still the same day, as the day starts symbolically at sunrise, not midnight). The best hour for the practice, the one when the energy is at the maximum, is the first suggested hour after sunrise. One last point worth mention­ing is that the connection with the energies is established at the time when the work begins, and is maintained henceforth until it is closed It would therefore not be a problem should a ritual require more than one hour to be carried out. CHOICE OF THE NUMBERS OF PRACTICES If you seek a specific, short action, I recommend that you carry out the ritual just once, during the correct day and hour as explained above. There are cases, though, when you will feel the need for a deeper action of the Tarot on your psyche, when you seek to obtain a more powerful effect on the etheric plane and, of course, on the phys­ical body. In such a case, the ritual shall be practiced several times, but it is essential that the number of practices not be not chosen at ran­dom. Numbers have strong symbolic meanings, and underlie power­ful energies. How many times a given practice is being carried out is therefore a major aspect of the work. The table on the next page gives"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"242 PRINCIPLES OF THE RITUAL WORK you the correct number of practices for each Major Arcanum, when the ritual is carried out more than once.

Yet, it is important to be familiar with it if one seeks to fully master the energy of the Tarot. As you shall see, the overall framework is similar to the individual practices. This is not surprising, as it relies on the same basic principles. But working in a group brings another dimension to the work, with new elements that widen the scope of potential actions. It is important to realize that, in individual work, the reliance upon the inner energy of the practitioner is relatively limited. Such works as described above were essentially directed toward obtaining some action upon yourself, and to achieve this you were calling for some external form of energy-the energy of the Tarot-which the ritual allowed to manifest through the specific aspect of the energy being invoked. The \"personal\" energy brought by the practitioner is very small when com­pared to the Tarot energy being called, so its impact is usually marginal 257"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"258 PRACTICES ON YOURSELF USING GROUP RITUAL at best. But when the energy of several practitioners is combined dur­ing group work, it becomes possible to use it in a meaningful manner, greatly increasing the power of the ritual for the action being sought after. The rituals for group work that I describe below are directed at having an impact on just one specific individual. You can use them with friends who, like you, are interested in exploring the energies of the Tarot, provided at least one member of the group would have al­ready completed in full the work of harmonization and integration described in the preceding chapter of this book. Of course, a group made up of several participants who have already completed this work shall usually achieve a more powerful action, as those individu­als will be more able at mobilizing, invoking, channeling, and master­ing the Tarot energies. But significant impact can still be achieved if just one person has completed the harmonization work. He or she will then act as an anchor point and guide for the group, providing a link between the energies of the group and of the Tarot. Some explanations about how the energy connections are estab­lished during group work will be helpful here. Any group possesses a particular aura, which naturally establishes itself out of the com­bination of the various individual auras of its members. During the ritual work, the specific techniques, signatures, and words of power provide the key to efficiently contact through invocation the powerful energy of the Tarot. Yet, it remains essential to connect this powerful, contacted aura with the equally strong aura of the group. But if at least one participant has already established an inner connection with the Tarot energies, then this connection will become automatically ac­tivated, opening a viable channel between the group and the Tarot archetypes. The Tarot energies will then be able to flow and act upon the goal being sought. While one previously connected participant is enough to conduct the work, of course, the efficiency of the ritual can only be enhanced if several participants have already established this inner connection with the Tarot. The practices shall be adapted according to the number of partic­ipants. There is no rule for the specific number of practitioners in a group.

It is essential, however, that there is a true harmony between the group members to allow for a balanced action, and to avoid tensions. One of the participants must be designated to lead the ritual. I shall refer to this person henceforth as the \"director of work.\" Al­though not a prerequisite, it is advisable that he or she be chosen from among those who already completed the harmonization work, and preferably be the most experienced with it. The director of work's role will be to guide the participants during the whole exercise, both on the visible and invisible planes. He or she must ensure harmony be­tween the participants; that is, the vibratory and energetic energy of the group, and therefore of the space where the operation is being carried out. The director of work is therefore, in a certain way, the \"weaver\" of the various forces and energies being called forward. As such, the director of work has an important responsibility to ensure that the Tarot energy is being channeled in the proper direction, cor­responding to the specific objective sought after. Ideally, the director of work should be somebody with experience in manipulating invis­ible energies, shaping and directing them as desired. Ritual The participants are gathered together in a circle, around the work­space. They wear comfortable clothes, sitting upright, with straight backs and their palms resting upon their thighs. They take a few mo­ments to relax, breathing calmly, with eyes closed or half closed. The participant who is designated to act as the director of work shall sit at the east of the workspace, facing the table with the candles and the Tarot cards. When the director of work perceives that the group is sufficiently relaxed, he or she stands up and turns around to face the east. The director of work then lights the candles in the sequence indicated above.

He or she raises the incense holder above for a few sec­onds, and in this position of offering says: \"Let us all visualize an in­tense red light, coming down from above us like small drops of fire, covering the whole workspace, and bringing us its strength.\" Carrying the incense holder, the director of work then moves around the workspace, drawing with the smoke a circle that encom­passes all participants. The drawing of the circle shall start in the east and be completed at the same point. All participants shall visualize a wall made of light mist rising from the circle, which circumvents the workspace. The person who is the intended beneficiary of the work shall be seated in the middle of the circle, facing the east.

Evocation of the Major Arcana Once the relaxation routine is completed, the participants open their eyes, while the director of work removes the veil covering the Tarot Major Arcanum that is the object of the practice. He or she describes in detail the image on the Major Arcanum, while the participants concentrate on visualizing it. This exercise should last for at least a few minutes, to reinforce the visualization. Then, if there are sufficient participants, they should hold hands with each other, forming a circle surrounding the intended benefi­ciary sitting at the center. The director of work also remains in the center, standing up and facing the west.

Remaining at the same location, the director of work turns around to face the west, and then says: \"Visualize that particles of light are starting to circle around me and [name of the intended beneficiary of the work].

Those who have some understanding and knowledge of astrological symbolism know that your birthday is the precise anniversary (exact day and hour) when the celestial influences that will affect you for the next year are determined. The influences connected to this special day and hour may be associated with the influences of your native astro­logical chart in order to constitute something like a birth chart for the coming year. For example, if someone was born on May 20, 1971, at 6:30AM and the current year is 2004, then his or her birthday would fall on May 20, 2004 at 6:30 AM. You would therefore calculate the astral configuration precisely for this current birthday, as it will determine the major influences for the next twelve-month cycle (until May 20, 2005). However, an interpretation of the influences of this date should include and integrate the natal (birth) chart, which would (in this instance) be the chart for May 20, 1971."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"270 THE RITUAL OF THE BIRTHDAY It is not my intention to develop and elaborate on the topic of in­terpreting astrological charts in this book. I wish to emphasize to the reader the importance of the hour and day of the natal chart in calcu­lating the chart for the current birthday. Whatever special influences will affect you for the next twelve months will be sufficiently present in the accurately calculated birthday chart. Obviously, this opens the door for a wide array of advanced theurgic practices, which can be very powerful but are well beyond the scope of this book, so I will refrain from developing them here. Still, the work with the cards of the Tarot, and the energies they represent, provides you with a tool to act in this very special and privileged moment, so as to anchor within yourself, for the next twelve months, a better set of influences than the one dealt to you by the position of the planets at that time. You can see that you are moving beyond simple astrological in­terpretations; you are preparing to work on weaving your own des­tiny. When it is used in this way, the Tarot, which is often used as a simple tool for divination, becomes a powerful tool for taking action and rebuilding your inner self. In this way, you become the creator of your own destiny, directing the influences that affect you in a positive and constructive way. Those who believe that each individual's karma must be lived (and often suffered) to the full extent may object to this. But in reality, it merely proposes to put to good work a tool that is already available to you anyway. There is nothing morally wrong in seeking to create in your life the best possible circumstances, so that you can become the expression of who you truly are. The Ritual of the Birthday uses the entire Tarot deck. However, I recommend that you lay out the Major Arcana as indicated in the three tables below. There is a specific way of placing the cards around the circle. No­tice that two possibilities exist (regarding the placement of cards).

The eso­teric traditions affirm that a real correspondence exists between the macrocosm and the microcosm, between the universe, the cosmos, and the human body, in all its aspects. There is a constant interaction among these forces, a constant exchange of energy at the vibratory level. It is in this way that the symbolic and divine powers represented by the constellations and the stars are able to influence your psyche and your body. There is a real reciprocity that exists between you and these forces. The Ritual of the Birthday works to manifest the macro­cosmic energies present on your birthday inside of you on a physical and energetic level; this allows you to bring yourself into a state of harmonious balance, in order to generate a new cycle (for the coming year) of personal realization. The traditional representation used here is based on the Hermeti­cist representation of the universe. The Ta rot offers you a nearly in­finite combination of operative cards, which you may use to invoke these archetypal powers. The basic structure reproduces the zodiacal wheel, the seven plan­ets, and the four elements. You will envision yourself at the center of this diagram, acting both as the cosmic forces that give the creative energies and as the recipient of those forces. Everything used for this ceremony is part of an efficient design; each piece has a purpose and works harmoniously with the whole."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"274 THE RITUAL OF THE BIRTHDAY General Conditions Place: Set aside a quiet place to perform the ritual. Tides: Ideally, it would be best to perform the ritual at the day and hour of your birthday. It may not be possible for you to be free at the precise moment that is ideally suited to this practice. How­ever, you may adapt the ritual to your circumstances by applying the esoteric principles of \"rooting\" and \"magic bonds.\" In this case, you will have to create a natural witness. Directions for creating a witness are given below. Direction: Face east. Ritual Space: You will need an open space approximately seven feet by seven feet. A circle therein will be delimited by a white cord, which (when joined) will form a closed circle. During the ritual, you must be at the center of this circle.

They are organized around the place according to the representation above. The lighting of the lamps or candles will be accomplished in the same sequence as the numbers dictate in that part of the ritual. You must extinguish the lamps in the reverse order. As explained previously, when these lights are lit, do not have any other lit candles in the ritual space. The number of lit flames is important. You may use also an artificial light, as long as it does not affect your concentration. The Tarot: You will use the entire deck of the Divine Tarot (or your own Tarot deck) for this ritual, set up as described. You may place the zodiacal, planetary, and elemental cards at right angles to each other, so that they are easier to find when you need them.

Incense: You may choose the incense you prefer. Witness: You will need a square of white paper cut to 11/z inches by lllz inches and a white envelope. On your birthday, at the day and hour of your birth, retire to the quiet place. Allow time for preparation if were unable to prepare previously. Prior to, or just before the hour of your birth, set up the room for the ritual. Lastly, autograph the back of the witness paper, using the Briatic color, or black. On the front of the witness (the white paper), rub a bit of saliva or other bodily fluid. Affix some of your hair to the front of the witness as well, with invisible tape. Immediately place the wit­ness in the white envelope. Be sure that the body fluid and hair are affixed to the side opposite your signature. If you prepare the wit­ness in advance, you must keep it with you until you are ready to perform the Ritual of the Birthday. In any event, do not prepare the witness more than two days before your ritual. Miscellaneous: You will need a black ink pen, your notebook, your book, matches, and a tool to extinguish the candles. You will also need a chair or armchair, set facing the altar. Clothing: Dress in comfortable clothes. RITUAL Opening Place the cord on the floor in a circle.

Place the witness (white paper in the envelope) on the purple cloth, underneath the Tarot deck. You must have everything you need right beside you, inside the circle, because you may not leave the circle once you have closed the circle and started the ritual. You may leave once the ritual is complete and you have performed the closing. Stand erect in comfortable clothes inside the circle, facing east; allow your arms to hang naturally, on either side of your body. Re­main in this position a while, breathing quietly, with your eyes closed or slightly open. If you are using incense, put the incense in the censer and light it. Lift the incense to the heavens for a few moments while you think about its protective and purifying capacities. Using the incense, draw a circle above the cord while visualizing a wall of mist rising from the floor and extending up higher than the ceiling of your room. This wall of mist delineates your place of working. When the circle is closed, place the incense to the right of the Tarot deck as before. Light the candles.

If you don't know your as­cendant, start as indicated below, with the first sign of the zodiac. Take the twelve cards that represent the zodiac and place them at the positions indicated, around the circle clockwise.

As you study the Tree of Life's symbolic design, you must keep in mind that its most important feature is the correspondence among the tradi­tional planets, astrological signs, and divinities. The divine powers have always been connected with specific elements, which Hermetic Qabalists later organized into correspondences between certain sym­bols and these original attributions. Because of your work, you are able to use this Qabalistic structure to balance your consciousness and physiology from a broader perspective. You will be using the power of the Arcana to accomplish this process in a powerful and original way. Before you begin, it is necessary to distinguish between the complete reharmonization as described in the previous chapter and this rebal­ancing practice. The purpose of the complete reharmonization is to act on the deepest levels of the psyche in very specific ways.

This work assumes that the prior exercises have been completed. Of course, you can use this exercise without having finished all the prior cycles. However, this ritual will have more impact and will produce results more rapidly if the precondition of the inner reharmonization has been met. As you will see below, it is helpful to perform this ritual at the new moon (the time when the moon is invisible; at the beginning of the moon's cycle). When the moon is waxing, ritual actions connected to the energetic bodies that surround you are more efficient and the rituals are able to more deeply affect the invisible bodies. If you want to use this kind of practice in rhythm with the cycles of the moon, it is good to use it at the same part of the moon's cycle every month. In order to perform this ritual, you will need the reproduction of the Tree of Life, which you will find in the appendix under the Major Arcana. You can copy this representation and enlarge it to 11 inches x 17 inches. The diagram of the Tr ee of Life you will find below in the text of this exercise is intended to help you understand what actions to perform. GENERAL CONDITIONS Place: A quiet place set aside for ritual use. Tides: If possible, the day of the new moon. Direction: Face east. Bomos: A table (or any flat surface) may be used as the altar. The cloth used to cover the homos should be black. Equipment: Three candlesticks and three candles made of beeswax, or plain white candles (in positions 1, 2, and 3) or three colored lamps (position 1, black; position 2, white; position 3, red). The three candles are placed at the eastern side of the altar and at the top of each pillar of the Tr ee of Life.

Once you had the chance to familiarize yourself with the twenty-four Arcana and practice the rituals I pro­vided with each of them, I explained that the nature of the cards, as well as the divine powers to which they relate, constitute an extraordi­nary tool. You now realize that the Aurum Solis Tarot has a real effect on all of your subtle bodies. Whether I am talking about the physi­cal body or its psychological aspects, I am really discussing the same thing, because I am considering the interesting relationship between the invisible body and the physical plane. Remember that the invis­ible plane has an effect on the visible plane. Using this principle, I will now consider the important practice of \"work at a distance.\" I will begin by connecting my explanation of these practices with some basic principles of the occult art. Up to this point, you have been focused on the idea that the ac­tion of the Arcana is intentional. You utilized its energy by intentionally 297"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"298 RULES GOVERNING ASTRAL PRACTICES choosing the cards to realize your goal. Whether you decided to work in a group or as an individual, the action portion of the ritual consisted of invoking the powers of an Arcanum to transform a particular situation. You learned that this action implicated every part of your being, as well as the invisible dimensions. Every part of these rituals involved direct, intentional choices and actions. It is also possible to have an indirect effect on the invisible dimensions and the material plane by using the energies known as the subtle bodies. To day, the distinguishable subtle bodies are relatively well-known. These invisible bodies are generally represented as being egg-shaped. Action at a distance utilizing these subtle bodies is based on two theo­ries, which complement each other. The first theory is that the boundaries of your subtle bodies are not always as definite as you might imagine. Their boundaries are similar to the boundaries of your mind: your mind does not have a defined border; it does not stop at the walls of your skull. Likewise, your invisible bodies expand into infinity, with the energetic bodies of everyone on the planet interpenetrating each other, just like radio waves do. In order to understand how your invisible bodies work, we will continue with the radio wave analogy. Radio stations broadcast waves all around you. At any moment, an extraordinary number of radio programs, t.elevision programs, cell phone chats, etc., permeate and penetrate your body and senses. Yet, you are unaware of this cacophony of noise. This maelstrom of in­formation is invisible and undetectable using your normal senses. In a way, radio waves do not exist for you. However, if you have a radio receiver and you turn it on, you will immediately be able to hear a broadcast from a radio station. If you wish, you can turn the dial from one radio station to another, revealing the large number of radio sta­tions that are broadcasting signals. To understand this analogy more deeply, you must now establish a clear distinction between the wave itself and the actual origin of this wave. Obviously, the singer whose voice you hear, or the crowds you hear cheering at the baseball game, are not actually present in your home; their origin is the radio station.

This maelstrom of in-you must now establish a and the actual origin of this you hear, or the crowds you not actually present in your reality is that information RULES GOVERNING ASTRAL PRACTICES 299 is sent on radio waves that you are able to receive. In order to under­stand the concept of \"action at a distance;' you must believe that it is possible to emit some kind of wave that is capable of acting on some receiver at a distance from where the wave originates. Each time you use a remote control to turn on your TV, for example, you are acting at a distance. Tarot cards work in a very similar manner to the TV remote con­trol. Your goal is to learn to use the power of an Arcanum to effect a result on someone who is not physically present with you. The trans­mitter (the remote control) is the Arcanum, the receiver is the indi­vidual (the TV) for whom you are using the ritual, and the radio wave (the Tarot) is the invisible link that is created between you and the person you want to affect. Energy is generated, directed, and trans­mitted by the power of your decision to act. In other words, it is your will that allows you to work on the invisible planes. When you per­form an action at a distance, you will have an effect on the various subtle bodies of the receiver. This will be true even if the receiver re­mains unaware of your action. So this energy is sent as information, which is intended to have an effect on the receiver. The second theory is that the waves that travel through space af­fect us not as effects of the cause, but as the manifestation of the real presence of the cause. Put another way, the subtle bodies have no real limits in space but are present simultaneously at all points in the uni­verse. So, at this moment, as I write these words, the auras of all the readers of this book are present here with me. If you understand this to be the case, then you are not really trying to act at a distance; you are really trying to manipulate your own invisible bodies, which are always present with you. The result of any action on your own invis­ible bodies will reverberate on your more dense bodies. As you might imagine, your difficulty is that you are trying to operate on one aura out of all the ones that are present with you. To do this, you must de­termine a precise place in which you can exclude all the others (such as a circle or, better, a hexagon), and then authorize only the presence of the single aura upon which you have decided to act."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"300 RULES GOVERNING ASTRAL PRACTICES These two theories are the origin of two different kinds of prac­tices that may be used to accomplish magic at a distance. For now, you do not have to choose one over the other. I will outline various practices that will enable you to act at a distance. Later, in more ad­vanced practices, you will be able to test the two modes, so that you can decide which one is the best for you. In any case, you will really be surprised at the power of these rituals and the results you can achieve with this kind of practice. At this juncture, you are probably starting to imagine the diverse practices you could generate using these concepts. The purpose of these rituals is the same as I presented for rituals using the Arcanum, and the constraints are also the same. The only difference is in the process itself, which will vary slightly from ritual to ritual, and which must include and employ the principles I just described. Here I need to emphasize your responsibility and obligation when doing this work. When you use any practice that has a direct effect on others, it is clear that the willing presence of the person for whom you are performing the ritual is tantamount to an agreement, giving you permission to perform this invisible action. In that circumstance, the moral aspect is resolved because you are performing the ritual with his or her agreement. This is also true whether you perform the ritual alone or in a group. However, whenever you use this \"action at a distance;' you will be using the divine powers of the Arcana to produce an invisible action that will directly affect someone; therefore, I strongly recommend that you never perform such magic without the full consent of the person you are working to help. This consent is not a simple moral re­quirement because of your relationship with the other person. When­ever you aim this energy at someone else, that target person has a real effect on the outcome of your action. Indeed, when the individual for whom you are working actively knows you will be working to help him or her, then that person will unconsciously help prepare his or her psychical bodies for this invisible intervention. Even if the process of this preparation is not deliberate and conscious, it is possible to notice a mark (or evidence of this kind of preparation) on the per-as an intrusion and More than this ope�t.itdl intention and action When someone's fragile and more kind of damage on the that you specify the your ritual.

Thus, when you perform the ritual for this person, his or her in­visible bodies receive your waves and react spontaneously, making it much easier for you to achieve your goal. Your work is no longer felt as an intrusion and your impact will be greater and more powerful. More than this operative aspect on the invisible plane, the person will not be passive, nor will he or she be unconsciously weakened, and thus the subject of our outer will. You must absolutely avoid any magical action that will weaken anyone's psyche, and this is even truer when you are working with \"action at a distance,\" no matter on whom you are working. Even if you perform this ritual with good intentions and all the goodwill in the world, if you don't have the permission of the other person, you would be weakening his or her defenses. In other words, the positive intention and action would result in negative consequences. When someone's natural defenses have been weakened, they are fragile and more easily influenced by others. To avoid inflicting this kind of damage on the person for whom you are working, it is best that you specify the day and the hour during which you will perform your ritual. This gives his or her psyche a chance to prepare the physi­cal body and open the subtle bodies so that you are most effective. You may suggest that the recipient relax for the duration of the ritual period. If possible, you might perform your ritual during the night, while the person is asleep. As I am sure you already know, the subcon­sciousness and the subtle bodies are more receptive during sleep than during the awake and aware state, making your ritual action easier and more effective. As with any practice of this sort, it is obvious that there is no real difference between a positive and a negative action. If you think about a tool (for example, a knife), it is not the tool itself that is dangerous, but the way you use it and the purpose you use it for. A knife can be used in surgery to alleviate suffering, or a knife can be used in an assault to maim. These practices and rituals I have described must be used in a positive sense. The Western Tradition reminds you that"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"302 RULES GOVERNING ASTRAL PRACTICES if you plan to use magic to harm someone, you can expect a nasty backlash. Simply put, this backlash is a reaction of the subtle bodies of the person targeted in this way. The person's subtle bodies echo or mirror the intended action back to the magical operator, intensifying the intended effects. It is exactly like focusing light through a magni­fying glass; there is always a certain amount of reflection. When you practice on someone who does not know what you are doing, there is always a spontaneous and unconscious reaction reflecting the energy back at you. This is why I say there is a backlash unless you tell the other person about your intention to perform a ritual. If you are performing a healing ritual for someone, and you fail to get permission first, you might imagine that the backlash would be amplified and positive, as your intentions were good. The reality is that it is impossible to predict what kind of outcome you will get. Everything depends on the nature and activity of the subtle bodies of the individual in question. The only thing certain is that there will be a reaction. To avoid this reaction, simply ask permission first. It is certainly possible to imagine instances in which you might prefer that the person you are attempting to help remains unaware of your actions, so that you are able to be discreet, rather than asking permission. If it is impossible to ask permission from the other per­son, and performing the healing ritual without permission is the only solution, it is permissible to call upon the divinities and the Angel of the Tarot to act as intermediaries for your action, indicating to them that you wish them to take action only if the help you offer is compat­ible with the person's life. This is a conditional ritual. However, I must emphasize that it is best to inform the person, or perform it at his or her request.

Select a photograph of the person (a photo used for an ID, for example). Its size must not exceed the size of the magic square of the Tarot. The person requesting your help must have put a small amount of a body fluid (saliva, for exam­ple) onto the photo. The name, date of birth, and signature of the person must be written in black ink by the person concerned on the back of the photo. Lastly, a hair of the person requesting your help must be taped on the back of the photo. Before and after the ritual, the photo will be kept in a white envelope on which you will write the name of the person. 2.

Remain in this position for a few moments, breathing quietly, with your eyes closed or slightly open. Open your eyes, and light the lamps in the sequence as indicated in Part Four. Knock once on the table with your knuckles (hand closed into a fist). This sharp rap will mark the beginning of the ritual work. Declaim: \"May this ritual work that I am about to perform for [name of the person for whom you are working], which is for the pur­pose of [state the purpose of your ritual/goal] and which is performed under the auspices of the Powers of the Tarot, begin!\" Light the incense in the sequence indicated in Part Four of this book. Using the index finger of your right hand, draw a circle above the cord while you visualize an invisible wall of mist (bluish fog) forming above the cord. Concentrate on delineating a special invisible zone for your work. Raise your arms, palms facing in the direction of the circle, partic­ularly directed toward the witness, which is at the center of the circle. Relax and declaim: ''At this instant, may an invisible link be cre­ated between this witness and [name of the person for whom you are working].\" Confidently imagine that everything you accomplish in this circle acts immediately and directly on the person you are working for. Be convinced that a real link has been created during your invocation. The witness on the altar acts as a link through the invisible plane to the person, even though he or she is not present. Light the incense. Lift it above the circle for a few moments, visu­alizing an intense glowing light dripping fine droplets of fire, imbuing the circle with its force."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"306 INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES FOR WORKING AT A DISTANCE The Dedication Prior to performing this ritual, you must compose a short prayer to the chosen divinity, which must include your statement of intent. You will now speak this prayer aloud or say it in your mind, in order to indicate the reason you have called upon this power. Declaim this dedication in a format identical to, or equivalent to, the following ex­ample: \"0 Powerful Divinity [name of the Div_inity of the chosen Major Arcanum], who controls this world, I call to you and ask you to [state the precise intention].\" Pronounce the sacred names while you simul­taneously draw the corresponding signature above the witness. Once again, direct your arms and the palms of your hands toward the witness at the center of the circle. As you do so, concentrate on the power of the Tarot taking effect. Be seated and relax for a few moments, breathing deeply. Remain in this position as you continue to relax and feel the sensations of your physical body. Continue the relaxation meditation for a while, as if you were going somewhere else in your mind and doing something else. (Be careful of the burning candles. The colored lamps are a better choice for exactly this reason: they are less risky when you are trying to relax). After a while (for a maximum of one hour), you must return to consciousness and end the process. Using the index finger of your right hand, draw a circle coun­terclockwise above the cord, which delimits the circle, in order to dissolve the wall of mist.

FINAL WORDS At the end of this study, perhaps it might be interesting to look back over the ground covered. Congratulations-a part of the veil of the sacred mysteries has just been removed! Prior to your exposure to this book, you probably understood the Tarot to be a simple group of symbols that might be useful for divina­tion, or as a symbolic tool that is beneficial to study. There have been many books about the Tarot that have explained how to use it in this way. In fact, the Tarot does constitute a reliable guide that is capa­ble of enlightening you about yourself and the world that surrounds you. This powerful oracle corresponds perfectly with your culture, your unconscious, your imagination, and your myths. It is a limitless source of understanding when you study it. Yet, the Tarot offers you much, much more. A deeper understand­ing of the Tarot reveals valid talismans that are connected with potent energies or divine spirits. Have I not demonstrated that Hermeticism is intended, by definition, to place the most secret and effective tools in the most external and visible appearances? The time has come to reveal some of these critical keys to theurgic work. It is for this reason that I introduced these practices and rituals, which enable you to draw on the power of the Tarot. Once you are in contact with the divinities of the Arcana, you will be able to work ac­tively on yourself and use the different aspects of this deck to change your life. Whether it is used on the physical or the psychological level,"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"308 INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES FOR WORKING AT A DISTANCE the energy of the Tarot is immediately effective when you know how to use it and to invoke it. The use of the Tarot in divination opens the doors to understand­ing your destiny, to what constitutes your existence and the mani­fested forces that comprise it. It is possible to stop being merely an observer; you now understand how to take an active role in designing your destiny. When you work with the energies of the Tarot and with the practices presented in this book, you are taking decisive action that gives you control over your life. The first steps of this process are the steps of introspection and progressive harmonization of energies; these are part of the inner work of the Tarot. Some practices, such as the Ritual of the Birthday, free you from being a victim of external circumstances, so that you may decide for yourself what direction you want your life to take. You may also decide that you wish to do something beyond the solitary use of these keys. You may decide to begin group practices, for example, in a seminar. There are many options for you to expand your understanding and use of the Tarot. The powerful Arcana of the Tarot can be cached and, thereafter, used in an infinite number of ways. The Ogdoadic Tradition of the Ordo Aurum Solis has given you these keys. They open up new worlds to you.

APPLNDIX 1: MAGIC SQUARLS (KAMLAS) MAGIC SQUARES (KAMEAS) USED IN THE RITUALS OF THE TAROT The existence of magic squares has been historically validated over the last four thousand years in all civilizations. Magic squares (also called \"kameas\" in the Ogdoadic Tradition) were very often used in ancient civilizations as talismans, and have also been found engraved on monuments, medals, cups, and porcelain plates. They appeared in Asia around the year 2000 BCE. It is undoubtedly, for this reason, that the majority of these artifacts were discovered in China. There were also many found in the region of Maghreb because these squares were used by Arabian mathematicians. The greatest mathematicians (such as Fermat and Euler) studied magic squares. The famous painter and engraver Albrecht Durer was fascinated by these interesting mathematical curiosities. In fact, there is a magic square in one of his engravings. 309"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"310 APPENDIX 1 There are many different magic squares, therefore mathematicians have studied the properties of these squares in order to understand and explain the process of constructing and using them. The proof of this research appears in Arabic manuscripts dated as far back as the ninth century, and is still found in Arabicwritings today. The mathematical definition of a magic square is simple. A magic square is a square grid of N rows and N columns (where N is equal to or greater than 3), for which the sum of all the integers of a line, a col­umn, or a diagonal all yields the same result, and no number placed in a magic square may be repeated within that square. To clarify, let us look at an example: 4 9 2 3 5 7 8 1 6 First line: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. Second line: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. Third line: 8 + 1 + 6 = 15. First column: 4 + 3 + 8 = 15. Second column: 9 + 5 + 1 = 15. Third column: 2 + 7 + 6 = 15. First diagonal: 2 + 5 + 8 = 15. Second diagonal: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. Thus, magic squares are mathematical curiosities, which have been studied throughout history. As explained above, the esoteric use of magic squares seems just as ancient as the mathematical study of them. My goal in this text is to explain how you may use magic squares for esoteric purposes. Among the vast number of available magic squares, seven pri­mary squares were chosen by theurgists and Hermeticists as being the most valuable for esoteric use. Each one was associated with one of the seven planets identified by the ancients. These Western traditions have been described Agrippa (sixteenth ceoltill spond to the seven olaalll perspective.

In this regard, it is interesting to note that the Sephirothic Tree, or the Tree of Life, has ten spheres on it. The lower seven spheres of the Tree of Life corre­spond to the seven planets (see references in earlier chapters). Magic squares were associated (by Agrippa) with planets, as well as the order of the Sephiroth on the Tr ee of Life. Thus, by counting the spheres starting at the top of the Tree, the sphere corresponding to Saturn is the third sphere. Therefore, the magic square 3x3 was associated with Binah. Let us look again at the entire Qabalistic Tree from this perspective. First sphere: Kether; no square, no planet. Second sphere: Chokmah; no square, no planet. Third sphere: Binah, square 3x3, Saturn. Fourth sphere: Chesed, square 4x4, Jupiter. Fifth sphere: Geburah, square 5x5, Mars. Sixth sphere: Tiphareth, square 6x6, Sun. Seventh sphere: Netzach, square 7x7, Venus. Eighth sphere: Hod, square 8x8, Mercury. Ninth sphere: Yesod, square 9x9, Moon. Te nth sphere: Malkuth, square 10x10, elemental sphere. As Agrippa explained, magic squares or sacred tables were con­sidered to be channels for celestial harmony. Each of the numbers and drawings on them (such as sigils) select specific energies from both the invisible universe and the visible planets, and channel that energy to the magical operator. Thus, if you draw or use a magic square with a specific intention, it will connect you immediately to the right energy. Magic squares are powerful centers of energy, which you can use to increase the efficacy of your magical practices. They link to the sa-"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"312 APPENDIX 1 cred divine powers of the Tarot. The connection between these two kinds of energies creates a very powerful pentacle. Generally, magic squares are composed of numbers. In the Chris­tian Qabalah, however, these numbers are often replaced with Hebrew letters when used in magic rituals. At this point, you would do well to recall what was said in the previous chapters about the powers of the letters of certain alphabets being connected to the egregore of that culture. It is clear that, if you use Hebrew letters to attempt to contact Greek divinities, it would be a strange brew and not very effective. It would be like speaking Hebrew to attempt to get the attention of a person who normally speaks Greek. If you are lucky, he may be able to understand, but the response will be slow and not as powerful. More­over, a magic square that uses Hebrew letters is deeply connected to the Hebrew Tradition and the Hebrew egregore, not the Hermetic Tradition. This is why I recommend that you experiment with magic squares that employ Greek letters when you attempt to call on Greek divinities. You will be surprised at the very important difference in the quality of the energy and the immediate and effective response you experience when you use this strategy. Here is how to use Greek letters numerically. The Greek alpha­bet is composed of 27 letters; numbers higher than 27 are reduced by adding up the digits of the original number to obtain a number lower or equal to 27. For example, the number 32 will yield 3 + 2 = 5. The 5 is thus replaced (if necessary) by the Greek letter epsilon. (This same rule is used for the Hebrew alphabet, which is composed of 22 letters.) It must also be understood that magic squares employing Latin letters are not effective for use in magic rituals. The power of the squares comes from the archetype of the letters (their meaning, his­tory, ancient ritual usage, and power of form). This connection is fundamental to the ability of these letters to act as links to potent archetypes. To use magic squares, you can photocopy the models given below. They will be adequate for entry-level work.

Once you have more ex-APPENDIX 1 313 perience using them and feel more connected to the egregore, you will start to be inspired with new ideas about how to attract more power to the sacred letters and from the egregore to which they are connected. Kameas, or magic squares, are generally written on pieces of parchment or cardboard; however, this is not the best form for their use in rituals. In fact, the sacred letters (Greek, Hebrew, Enochian, etc.) have an extremely intense power, and their precise design is very important to effect a real and substantive result. Although there is a potent effect generated by the action of the forms themselves, which is called the \"powers of the form,\" this kind of energy is limited by the thickness of the different letters of the kameas. In the past, the most powerful kameas were engraved in stone. The Bible tells us that the commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai were engraved by God in stone. The sacred characters were carved in a three-dimen­sional thickness and, in fact, the most powerful action possible is a consequence of having a symbol carved in three dimensions. Therefore, to get the best results, you must use a magic square that is properly and precisely engraved. When you use a properly engraved magic square, you have simultaneous access to the power of the let­ters themselves, the power of certain combinations of the letters, as well as the power of the entire square and its manifestation in three­dimensional space. There are seven traditional kameas associated with the sacred planets and divinities. The rituals utilize the powers of the kameas and the invocations inscribed on them. There are also special meditations that can help you learn how to connect to the powers of each of the Sephiroth, the planets, and the divine planes. The challenge for the practitioner is to create a link or union between the magical need, the kamea designed to accomplish that need, and the aesthetics involved in a very precise engraving of stones. You will find kameas engraved in stone that you may order on the website of the author (http:/ /www.debiasi.org). Each kamea is very precisely en­graved in gold on a specially chosen stone."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"314 APPENDIX 1 MAGIC SQUARES OF THE TAROT (KAMEAS) Mars Here are kameas to be used in the rituals and practices of this book. lA IK�I Z Saturn fl. e B �IIBIKE r E z IZIEIIr H A F I I IH I A Kr I F I 19 Jupiter fl.

As an example, I will use the Arca­num of the Sun, connected to the divine entity Helios. In the upper plane (Briah in the Hebrew Qabalistic system), the name of this Ar­canum is ONOPHIS (ONO<DIL). As you can see in the correspond­ing chart for the sun (below), the magic square is the Kamea of the Sun (6x6). You must now look for the numerical correspondences for this letter of the Greek alphabet. You will see the word ONOPHIS in Greek: ONO<DIL. The values of the letters are: 70-50-70-500-10-200. The highest number on the Kamea of the Sun is 36, so the values for the name ONOPHIS must be reduced in order to be entered on the kamea. The reduction of the numbers for this name yields: 7-5-7-5-10-20. Once you have derived the numbers, place some carbon paper on the square and draw the sequence of numbers you see in the chart below. 6 32 3 34 35 28 8 30 15 23 24 21 17 13 9 26 12 4 2 31 ·� You will draw a littl� draw the sig;Jtum, you \"\"'1 '. square where you put the , Your choice must be gui -ics; it has to \"feel right\" to.,. ters, you must add a little ci1fj for the signature you willdlti square during your ritual 1fl cause you can enlarge it or� as a model when a signatuaft :}j Numerical Magic Sq� (used only to draw the s..aj Saturn ! 4 9 2 I 3 5 7 I 8 1 6 ------·-"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"draw the signatures you •nple, I will use the Arca­_ .. nnlrv Helios.

Your choice must be guided by inspiration and your sense of aesthet­ics; it has to \"feel right\" to you. If there are two identical successive let­ters, you must add a little circle on the line. This signature is the model for the signature you will draw in the air (generally) above the magic square during your ritual.
