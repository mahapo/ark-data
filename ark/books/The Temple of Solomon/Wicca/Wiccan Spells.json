It consisted mainly of parsley, hemlock, water of aconite, poplar leaves, soot, bat's blood, deadly nightshade (or belladonna), Henbane and Hashish. (Of course, Witches didn't really fly; however, the ointment did induce incredible hallucinations, psychic visions and astral projections.) The following is a modern Witch's flying ointment recipe. It is safer and much easier to use: Items: 1/4 cup lard - 1/2 tsp clove oil - 1 tsp chimney soot - 1/4 tsp dried cinquefoil 1/4 tsp dried mugwort - 1/4 tsp dried thistle - 1/4 dried vervain - 1/2 tsp benzoin tincture Ritual: Using a mortar and pestle, crush the dried herbs until almost powdered. In a small cauldron or saucepan, heat the lard over a low flame until it is melted completely. Add the herbs, the clove oil and chimney soot to the lard base and mix well. Add the benzoin as a natural preservative, stir together clockwise and then simmer for ten to fifteen minutes. Strain it through cheesecloth into a small heat resistant container and then allow it to cool. Store it in your refrigerator or in a cool dark place until it is ready to be used. On a night of the Full Moon, anoint your temples and Third Eye with a small amount of the flying ointment prior to astral projection or dream magick. NOTE: For external use only!
