P. BlavatskyTo the Editor of The Sun.Sir, −− One morning in 1867 Eastern Europe was startled by news of the most horrifying description.Michael Obrenovitch, reigning Prince of Serbia, his aunt, the Princess Catherine or Katinka, and her daughterhad been murdered in broad daylight, near Belgrade, in their own garden, assassin or assassins remainingunknown. The Prince had received several bullet−shots, and stabs, and his body was actually butchered; thePrincess was killed on the spot, her head smashed, and her young daughter, though still alive, was notexpected to survive. The circumstances are too recent to have been forgotten, but in that part of the world, atthe time, the case created a delirium of excitement. In the Austrian dominions and in those under the doubtful protectorate of Turkey, from Bucharest down toTrieste, no high family felt secure. In those half Oriental countries every Montecchi has its Capuletti, and itwas rumoured that the bloody deed was perpetrated by the Prince Kara−Gueorguevitch, or\"Tzerno−Gueorgey,\" as he is usually called in those parts. Several persons innocent of the act were, as isusual in such cases imprisoned, and the real murderers escaped justice. A young relative of the victim, greatlybeloved by his people, a mere child, taken for the purpose from a school in Paris, was brought over inceremony to Belgrade and proclaimed Hospodar of Serbia. In the turmoil of political excitement the tragedyof Belgrade was forgotten by all but an old Serbian matron who had been attached to the Obrenovitch family,and who, like Rachel, would not be comforted for the death of her children. After the proclamation of theyoung Obrenovitch, nephew of the murdered man, she had sold out her property and disappeared; but notbefore taking a solemn vow on the tombs of the victims to avenge their deaths. The writer of this truthful narrative had passed a few days at Belgrade, about three months before the horriddeed was perpetrated, and knew the Princess Katinka. She was a kind, gentle, and lazy creature at home;abroad she seemed a Parisienne in manners and education. As nearly all the personages who will figure inthis true story are still living, it is but decent that I should withhold their names, and give only initials. The old Serbian lady seldom left her house, going but to see the Princess occasionally. Crouched on a pile ofpillows and carpeting, clad in the picturesque national dress, she looked like the Cumaean sibyl in her days ofcalm repose. Strange stories were whispered about her Occult knowledge, and thrilling accounts circulatedsometimes among the guests assembled round the fireside of the modest inn. Our fat landlord's maiden aunt'scousin had been troubled for some time past by a wandering vampire, and had been bled nearly to death bythe nocturnal visitor, and while the efforts and exorcisms of the parish pope had been of no avail, the victimwas luckily delivered by Gospoja P−−−, who had put to flight the disturbing ghost by merely shaking her fistat him, and shaming him in his own language. It was in Belgrade that I learned for the first time this highlyinteresting fact in philology, namely, that spooks have a language of their own. The old lady, whom I willcall Gospoja P−−− , was generally attended by another personage destined to be the principal actress in ourtale of horror. It was a young gipsy girl from some part of Roumania, about fourteen years of age. Where shewas born, and who she was, she seemed to know as little as anyone else. I was told she had been brought oneday by a party of strolling gipsies, and left in the yard of the old lady, from which moment she became aninmate of the house. She was nicknamed \"the sleeping girl,\" as she was said to be gifted with the faculty ofapparently dropping asleep wherever she stood, and speaking her dreams aloud. The girl's heathen name wasFrosya. About eighteen months after the news of the murder had reached Italy, where I was at the time, I travelledover the Banat in a small waggon of my own, hiring a horse whenever I needed one. I met on my way an old Nightmare TalesCAN THE DOUBLE MURDER?2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Frenchman, a scientist, travelling alone after my own fashion, but with the difference that while he was apedestrian, I dominated the road from the eminence of a throne of dry hay in a jolting waggon. I discoveredhim one fine morning slumbering in a wilderness of shrubs and flowers, and had nearly passed over him,absorbed as I was in the contemplation of the surrounding glorious scenery. The acquaintance was soonmade, no great ceremony of mutual introduction being needed. I had heard his name mentioned in circlesinterested in mesmerism, and knew him to be a powerful adept of the school of Dupotet. \"I have found,\" he remarked, in the course of the conversation after I had made him share my seat of hay,\"one of the most wonderful subjects in this lovely Thebaide. I have an appointment to−night with the family.They are seeking to unravel the mystery of a murder by means of the clairvoyance of the girl . . . she iswonderful!\" \"Who is she?\" I asked. \"A Roumanian gipsy. She was brought up, it appears, in the family of the Serbian reigning Prince, who reignsno more, for he was very mysteriously mur−−− Halloo, take care! Diable, you will upset us over theprecipice!\" he hurriedly exclaimed, unceremoniously snatching from me the reins, and giving the horse aviolent pull. \"You do not mean Prince Obrenovitch? \" I asked aghast. \"Yes, I do; and him precisely. To−night I have to be there, hoping to close a series of seances by finallydeveloping a most marvellous manifestation of the hidden power of the human spirit; and you may come withme. I will introduce you; and besides, you can help me as an interpreter, for they do not speak French.\" As I was pretty sure that if the somnambule was Frosya, the rest of the family must be Gospoja P−−−, Ireadily accepted. At sunset we were at the foot of the mountain, leading to the old castle, as the Frenchmancalled the place. It fully deserved the poetical name given it. There was a rought bench in the depths of one ofthe shadowy retreats, and as we stopped at the entrance of this poetical place, and the Frenchman wasgallantly busying himself with my horse on the suspicious−looking bridge which led across the water to theentrance gate, I saw a tall figure slowly rise from the bench and come towards us. It was my old friend Gospoja P−−−, looking more pale and more mysterious than ever. She exhibited nosurprise at seeing me, but simply greeting me after the Serbian fashion, with a triple kiss on both cheeks, shetook hold of my hand and led me straight to the nest of ivy. Half reclining on a small carpet spread on the tallgrass, with her back leaning against the wall, I recognized our Frosya. She was dressed in the national costume of the Wallachian women, a sort of gauze turban intermingled withvarious gilt medals and bands on her head, white shirt with opened sleeves, and petticoats of variegatedcolours. Her face looked deadly pale, her eyes were closed, and her countenance presented that stony,sphinx−like look which characterizes in such a peculiar way the entranced clairvoyant somnambule. If it werenot for the heaving motion of her chest and bosom, ornamented by rows of medals and bead necklaces whichfeebly tinkled at every breath, one might have thought her dead, so, lifeless and corpse−like was her face. TheFrenchman informed me that he had sent her to sleep just as we were approaching the house, and that shenow was as he had left her the previous night; he then began busying himself with the sujet, as he calledFrosya. Paying no further attention to us, he shook her by the hand, and then making a few rapid passesstretched out her arm and stiffened it. The arm as rigid as iron, remained in that position. He then closed allher fingers but one −− the middle finger −− which he caused to point at the evening star, which twinkled inthe deep blue sky. Then he turned round and went over from right to left, throwing on some of his fluids here,again discharging them at another place; busying himself with his invisible but potent fluids, like a painterwith his brush when giving the last touches to a picture. Nightmare TalesCAN THE DOUBLE MURDER?3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The old lady, who had silently watched him, with her chin in her hand the while, put her thin,skeleton−looking hands on his arm and arrested it, as he was preparing himself to begin the regular mesmericpasses. \"Wait,\" she whispered, \"till the star is set and the ninth hour completed. The Vourdalaki are hovering round;they may spoil the influence.\" \"What does she say?\" enquired the mesmerizer, annoyed at her interference. I explained to him that the old lady feared the pernicious influences of the Vourdalaki. \"Vourdalaki! What's that −− the Vourdalaki?\" exclaimed the Frenchman. \"Let us be satisfied with Christianspirits, if they honour us to−night with a visit, and lose no time for the Vourdalaki!\" I glanced at the Gospoja. She had become deathly pale and her brow was sternly knitted over her flashingblack eyes. \"Tell him not to jest at this hour of the night!\" she cried. \"He does not know the country. Even this holychurch may fail to protect us once the Vourdalaki are roused. What's this?\" pushing with her foot a bundle ofherbs the botanizing mesmerizer had laid near on the grass. She bent over the collection and anxiouslyexamined the contents of the bundle, after which she flung the whole into the water. \"It must not be left here,\" she firmly added; \"these are the St. John's plants, and they might attract thewandering ones.\" Meanwhile the night had come, and the moon illuminated the landscape with a pale, ghostly light. The nightsin the Banat are nearly as beautiful as in the East, and the Frenchman had to go on with his experiments in theopen air, as the priest of the church had prohibited such in the tower, which was used as the parsonage, forfear of filling the holy precincts with the heretical devils of the mesmerizer, which, the priest remarked, hewould be unable to exorcise on account of their being foreigners. The old gentleman had thrown off his travelling blouse, rolled up his shirt sleeves, and now, striking atheatrical attitude, began a regular process of mesmerization. Under his quivering fingers the odile fluid actually seemed to flash in the twilight. Frosya was placed withher figure facing the moon, and every motion of the entranced girl was discernible as in daylight. In a fewminutes large drops of perspiration appeared on her brow, and slowly rolled down her pale face, glittering inthe moonbeams. Then she moved uneasily about and began chanting a low melody, to the words of which theGospoja, anxiously bent over the unconscious girl, was listening with avidity and trying to catch everysyllable. With her thin finger on her lips, her eyes nearly starting from their sockets, her frame motionless, theold lady seemed herself transfixed into a statue of attention. The group was a remarkable one, and I regrettedthat I was not a painter. What followed was a scene worthy to figure in Macbeth. At one side she, the slendergirl, pale and corpse−like, writhing under the invisible fluid of him who for the hour was her omnipotentmaster; at the other the old matron, who, burning with her unquenched fire of revenge, stood waiting for thelong−expected name of the Prince's murderer to be at last pronounced. The Frenchman himself seemedtransfigured, his grey hair standing on end; his bulky clumsy form seemed to have grown in a few minutes.All theatrical pretence was now gone; there remained but the mesmerizer, aware of his responsibility,unconscious himself of the possible results, studying and anxiously expecting. Suddenly Frosya, as if liftedby some supernatural force, rose from her reclining posture and stood erect before us, again motionless andstill, waiting for the magnetic fluid to direct her. The Frenchman, silently taking the old lady's hand, placed itin that of the somnambulist, and ordered her to put herself en rapport with the Gospoja. Nightmare TalesCAN THE DOUBLE MURDER?4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"What seest thou, my daughter?\" softly murmured the Serbian Lady. \"Can your spirit seek out themurderers?\" \"Search and behold!\" sternly commanded the mesmerizer, fixing his gaze upon the face of the subject. \"I am on my way −− I go,\" faintly whispered Frosya, her voice seeming not to come from herself, but fromthe surrounding atmosphere. At this moment something so strange took place that I doubt my ability to describe it. A luminous vapourappeared, closely surrounding the girl's body. At first about an inch in thickness, it gradually expanded, and,gathering itself, suddenly seemed to break off from the body altogether and condense itself into a kind ofsemisolid vapour, which very soon assumed the likeness of the somnambule herself. Flickering about thesurface of the earth the form vacillated for two or three seconds, then glided noiselessly toward the river. Itdisappeared like a mist, dissolved in the moonbeams, which seemed to absorb it altogether. I had followed the scene with an intense attention. The mysterious operation, know in the East as theevocation of the scin−lecca, was taking place before my own eyes. To doubt was impossible, and Dupotetwas right in saying that mesmerism is the conscious Magic of the ancients, and Spiritualism the unconsciouseffect of the same Magic upon certain organisms. As soon as the vaporous double had smoked itself through the pores of the girl, Gospoja had, by a rapidmotion of the hand which was left free, drawn from under her pelisse something which looked to ussuspiciously like a small stiletto, and placed it as rapidly in the girl's bosom. The action was so quick that themesmerizer, absorbed in his work, had not remarked it, as he afterwards told me. A few minutes elapsed in adead silence. We seemed a group of petrified persons. Suddenly a thrilling and transpiercing cry burst fromthe entranced girl's lips, she bent forward, and snatching the stiletto from her bosom, plunged it furiouslyround her, in the air, as if pursuing imaginary foes. Her mouth foamed, and incoherent, wild exclamationsbroke from her lips, among which discordant sounds I discerned, several times two familiar Christian namesof men. The mesmerizer was so terrified that he lost all control over himself, and instead of withdrawing thefluid he loaded the girl with it still more. \"Take care,\" exclaimed I. \"Stop! You will kill her, or she will kill you!\" But the Frenchman had unwittingly raised subtle potencies of Nature over which he had no control. Furiouslyturning round, the girl struck at him a blow which would have killed him had he not avoided it by jumpingaside, receiving but a severe scratch on the right arm. The poor man was panic−stricken; climbing with anextraordinary agility, for a man of his bulky form, on the wall over her, he fixed himself on it astride, andgathering the remnants of his will power, sent in her direction a series of passes. At the second, the girldropped the weapon and remained motionless. \"What are you about?\" hoarsely shouted the mesmerizer in French, seated like some monstrous night−globinon the wall. `Answer me, I command you!\" \"I did . . . but what she . . . whom you ordered me to obey . . . commanded me to do,\" answered the girl inFrench, to my amazement. \"What did the old witch command you?\" irreverently asked he. \"To find them . . . who murdered . . . kill them . . . I did so . . . and they are no more . . . Avenged! . . .Avenged! They are . . .\" Nightmare TalesCAN THE DOUBLE MURDER?5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"An exclamation of triumph, a loud shout of infernal joy, rang loud in the air, and awakening the dogs of theneighbouring villages a responsive howl of barking began from that moment, like a ceaseless echo of theGospoja's cry: \"I am avenged! I feel it; I know it. My warning heart tells me that the fiends are no more.\" She fell panting onthe ground, dragging down, in her fall, the girl, who allowed herself to be pulled down as if she were a bag ofwool. \"I hope my subject did no further mischief to−night. She is a dangerous as well as a very wonderful subject,\"said the Frenchman. We parted. Three days after that I was at T−−−, and as I was sitting in the dining−room of a restaurant,waiting for my lunch, I happened to pick up a newspaper, and the first lines I read ran thus: VIENNA, 186−−. Two Mysterious Deaths. Last evening, at 9:45, as P−−− was about to retire, two of the gentlemen−in−waitingsuddenly exhibited great terror, as though they had seen a dreadful apparition. Theyscreamed, staggered, and ran about the room, holding up their hands as if to ward off theblows of an unseen weapon. They paid no attention to the eager questions of the prince andsuite, but presently fell writhing upon the floor, and expired in great agony. Their bodiesexhibited no appearance of apoplexy, nor any external marks of wounds, but, wonderful torelate, there were numerous dark spots and long marks upon the skin, as though they werestabs and slashes made without puncturing the cuticle. The autopsy revealed the fact thatbeneath each of these mysterious discolourations there was a deposit of coagulated blood.The greatest excitement prevails, and the faculty are unable to solve the mystery. AN UNSOLVED MYSTERYThe circumstances attending the sudden death of M. Delessert, inspector of the Police de Surete, seem tohave made such an impression upon the Parisian authorities that they were recorded in unusual detail.Omitting all particulars except what are necessary to explain matters, we produce here the undoubtedlystrange history. In the fall of 1861 there came to Paris a man who called himself Vic de Lassa, and was so inscribed upon hispassports. He came from Vienna, and said he was a Hungarian, who owned estates on the borders of theBanat, not far from Zenta. He was a small man, aged thirty−five, with pale and mysterious face, long blondehair, a vague, wandering blue eye, and a mouth of singular firmness. He dressed carelessly and unaffectedly,and spoke and talked without much empressement. His companion, presumably his wife, on the other hand,ten years younger than himself, was a strikingly beautiful woman, of that dark, rich, velvety, luscious, pureHungarian type which is so nigh akin to the gipsy blood. At the theatres, on the Bois, at the cafes, on theboulevards, and everywhere that idle Paris disports itself, Madame Aimee de Lassa attracted great attentionand made a sensation. They lodged in luxurious apartments on the Rue Richelieu, frequented the best places, received goodcompany, entertained handsomely, and acted in every way as if possessed of considerable wealth. Lassa hadalways a good balance chez Schneider, Ruter et Cie, the Austrian bankers in Rue Rivoli, and wore diamondsof conspicuous lustre. Nightmare TalesAN UNSOLVED MYSTERY6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"How did it happen then, that the Prefect of Police saw fit to suspect Monsieur and Madame de Lassa, anddetailed Paul Delessert, one of the most ruse inspectors of the force, to \"pipe\" him? The fact is, theinsignificant man with the splendid wife was a very mysterious personage, and it is the habit of the police toimagine that mystery always hides either the conspirator, the adventurer, or the charlatan. The conclusion towhich the Prefect had come in regard to M. de Lassa was that he was an adventurer and charlatan too.Certainly a successful one, then, for he was singularly unobtrusive and had in no way trumpeted the wonderswhich it was his mission to perform, yet in a few weeks after he had established himself in Paris the salon ofM. de Lassa was the rage, and the number of persons who paid the fee of 100 francs for a single peep into hismagic crystal, and a single message by his spiritual telegraph, was really astonishing. The secret of this wasthat M. de Lassa was a conjurer and deceiver, whose pretensions were omniscient and whose predictionsalways came true. Delessert did not find it very difficult to get an introduction and admission to De Lassa's salon. Thereceptions occurred every other day −− two hours in the forenoon, three hours in the evening. It was eveningwhen Inspector Delessert called in his assumed character of M. Flabry, virtuoso in jewels and a convert toSpiritualism. He found the handsome parlours brilliantly lighted, and a charming assemblage gathered ofwell−pleased guests, who did not at all seem to have come to learn their fortunes or fates, while contributingto the income of their host, but rather to be there out of complaisance to his virtues and gifts. Mme. de Lassa performed upon the piano or conversed from group to group in a way that seemed to bedelightful, while M. de Lassa walked about or sat in his insignificant, unconcerned way, saying a word nowand then, but seeming to shun everything that was conspicuous. Servants handed about refreshments, ices,cordials, wines, etc., and Delessert could have fancied himself to have dropped in upon a quite modestevening entertainment, altogether en regle, but for one or two noticeable circumstances which his observanteyes quickly took in. Except when their host or hostess was within hearing the guests conversed together in low tones, rathermysteriously, and with not quite so much laughter as is usual on such occasions. At intervals a very tall anddignified footman would come to a guest, and, with a profound bow, present him a card on a silver salver.The guest would then go out, preceded by the solemn servant, but when he or she returned to the salon −−some did not return at all −− they invariably wore a dazed or puzzled look, were confused, astonished,frightened, or amused. All this was so unmistakably genuine, and De Lassa and his wife seemed sounconcerned amidst it all, not to say distinct from it all, that Delessert could not avoid being forcibly struckand considerably puzzled. Two or three little incidents, which came under Delessert's own immediate observation, will suffice to makeplain the character of the impressions made upon those present. A couple of gentlemen, both young, both ofgood social condition, and evidently very intimate friends, were conversing together and tutoying one anotherat a great rate, when the dignified footman summoned Alphonse. He laughed gaily, \"Tarry a moment,cher Auguste,\" said he, \"and thou shalt know all the particulars of this wonderful fortune!\" \"Eh bien!\" Aminute had scarcely elapsed when Alphonse returned to the salon . His face was white and bore anappearance of concentrated rage that was frightful to witness. He came straight to Auguste, his eyes flashing,and bending his face toward his friend, who changed colour and recoiled, he hissed out \"Monsieur Lefebure,vous etes un lache! \" \"Very well, Monsieur Meunier,\" responded Auguste, in the same low tone, \"tomorrowmorning at six o'clock!\" \"It is settled, false friend, execrable traitor!\" \"A la mort!\" rejoined Alphonse, walkingoff. \"Cela va sans dire!\" muttered Auguste, going towards the hat−room. A diplomatist of distinction, representative at Paris of a neighbouring state, an elderly gentleman of superbaplomb and most commanding appearance, was summoned to the oracle by the bowing footman. After beingabsent about five minutes he returned, and immediately made his way through the press to M. de Lassa, whowas standing not far from the fireplace, with his hands in his pockets and a look of utmost indifference upon Nightmare TalesAN UNSOLVED MYSTERY7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"his face. Delessert standing near, watched the interview with eager interest. \"I am exceedingly sorry,\" said General Von −−, \"to have to absent myself so soon from your interestingsalon, M. de Lassa, but the result of my seance convinces me that my dispatches have been tampered with.\"\"I am sorry,\" responded M. de Lassa, with an air of languid but courteous interest; \"I hope you may be able todiscover which of your servants has been unfaithful.\" \"I am going to do that now,\" said the General, adding,in significant tones, \"I shall see that both he and his accomplices do not escape severe punishment.\" \"That isthe only course to pursue, Monsieur le Comte.\" The ambassador stared, bowed, and took his leave with abewilderment in his face that was beyond the power of his tact to control. In the course of the evening M. de Lassa went carelessly to the piano, and, after some indifferent vaguepreluding, played a remarkably effective piece of music, in which the turbulent life and buoyancy ofbacchanalian strains melted gently, almost imperceptibly away, into a sobbing wail of regret, and languor,and weariness, and despair. It was beautifully rendered, and made a great impression upon the guests, one ofwhom, a lady, cried, \"How lovely, how sad! Did you compose that yourself, M. de Lassa?\" He lookedtowards her absently for an instant, then replied: \"I? Oh, no! That is merely a reminiscence, madame.\" \"Doyou know who did compose it, M. de Lassa?\" enquired a virtuoso present. \"I believe it was originally writtenby Ptolemy Auletes, the father of Cleopatra,\" said M. de Lassa, in his indifferent musing way; \"but not in itspresent form. It has been twice re−written to my knowledge; still, the air is substantially the same.\" \"Fromwhom did you get it, M. de Lassa, if I may ask?\" persisted the gentleman. \"Certainly, certainly! The last timeI heard it played was by Sebastian Bach; but that was Palestrina's −− the present −− version. I think I preferthat of Guido of Arezzo −− it is ruder, but has more force. I got the air from Guido himself.\" \"You −− from−− Guido!\" cried the astonished gentleman. \"Yes, monsieur,\" answered De Lassa, rising from the piano withhis usual indifferent air. \"Mon Dieu cried the virtuoso, putting his hand to his head after the manner of Mr.Twemlow, \"Mon Dieu! that was in Anno Domini 1022.\" \"A little later than that −− July, 1031, if I rememberrightly,\" courteously corrected M. de Lassa. At this moment the tall footman bowed before M. Delessert, and presented the salver containing the card.Delessert took it and read: \"On vous accorde trente−cing secondes, M. Flabry, tout au plus !\" Delessertfollowed; the footman opened the door of another room and bowed again, signifying that Delessert was toenter. \"Ask no questions,\" he said briefly; \"Sidi is mute.\" Delessert entered the room and the door closedbehind him. It was a small room, with a strong smell of frankincense pervading it; the walls were coveredcompletely with red hangings that concealed the windows, and the floor was felted with a thick carpet.Opposite the door, at the upper end of the room near the ceiling was the face of a large clock, under it, eachlighted by tall wax candles, were two small tables, containing, the one an apparatus very like the commonregistering telegraph instrument, the other a crystal globe about twenty inches in diameter, set upon anexquisitely wrought tripod of gold and bronze intermingled. By the side of the door stood a man jet black incolour, wearing a white turban and burnous, and having a sort of wand of silver in one hand. With the otherhe took Delessert by the right arm above the elbow, and led him quickly up the room. He pointed to theclock, and it struck an alarum; he pointed to the crystal. Delessert bent over, looked into it, and saw −− afacsimile of his own sleeping−room, everything photographed exactly. Sidi did not give him time to exclaim,but still holding him by the arm, took him to the other table. The telegraph−like instrument began toclick−click. Sidi opened the drawer, drew out a slip of paper, crammed it into Delessert's hand, and pointed tothe clock, which struck again, The thirty−five seconds were expired. Sidi, still retaining hold of Delessert'sarm, pointed to the door and led him towards it. The door opened, Sidi pushed him out, the door closed, thetall footman stood there bowing −− the interview with the oracle is over. Delessert glanced at the piece ofpaper in his hand. It was a printed scrap, capital letters, and read simply: \"To M. Paul Delessert: Thepoliceman is always welcome, the spy is always in danger!\" Nightmare TalesAN UNSOLVED MYSTERY8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Delessert was dumbfounded a moment to find his disguise detected, but the words of the tall footman, \"Thisway if you please, M. Flabry,\" brought him to his senses. Setting his lips, he returned to the salon, andwithout delay sought M. de Lassa. \"Do you know the contents of this?\" asked he, showing the message. \"Iknow everything, M. Delessert,\" answered De Lassa, in his careless way.\" Then perhaps you are aware that Imean to expose a charlatan, and unmask a hypocrite, or perish in the attempt?\" said Delessert. \" Cela m'estegal, monsieur,\" replied De Lassa. \"You accept my challenge then?\" \"Oh! it is a defiance, then?\" replied DeLassa, letting his eye rest a moment upon Delessert, \"mais oui, je 1'accepte! And thereupon Delessertdeparted. Delessert now set to work aided by all the forces the Prefect of Police could bring to bear, to detect andexpose this consummate sorcerer, who the ruder processes of our ancestors would easily have disposed of −−by combustion. Persistent enquiry satisfied Delessert that the man was neither a Hungarian nor was namedDe Lassa; that no matter how far back his power of \"reminiscence\" might extend, in his present andimmediate form he had been born in this unregenerate world in the toy−making city of Nuremburg; that hewas noted in boyhood for his great turn for ingenious manufactures, but was very wild, and a mauvais sujet.In his sixteenth year he escaped to Geneva and apprenticed himself to a maker of watches and instruments.Here he had been seen by the celebrated Robert Houdin, the prestidigitateur . Houdin recognizing the lad'stalents, and being himself a maker of ingenious automata, had taken him off to Paris and employed him in hisown workshops, as well as for an assistant in the public performances of his amusing and curious diablerie.After staying with Houdin some years, Pflock Haslich (which was De Lassa's right name) had gone East inthe suite of a Turkish Pasha, and after many years' roving, in lands where he could not be traced under acloud of pseudonyms, had finally turned up in Venice, and come thence to Paris. Delessert next turned his attention to Mme. de Lassa. It was more difficult to get a clue by means of which toknow her past life; but it was necessary in order to understand enough about Haslich. At last, through anaccident, it became probable that Mme. Aimee was identical with a certain Mme. Schlaff, who had beenrather conspicuous among the demi−monde of Buda. Delessert posted off to that ancient city, and thencewent into the wilds of Transylvania to Mengyco. On his return, as soon as he reached the telegraph andcivilization, he telegraphed the Prefect from Kardszag: \"Don't lose sight of my man, nor let him leave Paris. Iwill run him in for you two days after I get back.\" It happened that on the day of Delessert's return to Paris the Prefect was absent, being with the Emperor atCherbourg. He came back on the fourth day, just twenty−four hours after the announcement of Delessert'sdeath. That happened, as near as could be gathered, in this wise: The night after Delessert's return he waspresent at De Lassa's salon with a ticket of admittance to a seance. He was very completely disguised as adecrepit old man, and fancied that it was impossible for any one to detect him. Nevertheless, when he wastaken into the room, and looked into the crystal, he was utterly horror−stricken to see there a picture ofhimself, lying face down and senseless upon the side−walk of a street; and the message he received read thus:\"What you have seen will be, Delessert, in three days. Prepare!\" The detective, unspeakably shocked, retiredfrom the house at once and sought his own lodgings. In the morning he came to the office in a state of extreme dejection. He was completely unnerved. In relatingto a brother inspector what had occurred, he said \"That man can do what he promises, I am doomed!\" He said that he thought he could make a complete case out against Haslich alias De Lassa, but could not doso without seeing the Prefect and getting instructions. He would tell nothing in regard to his discoveries inBuda and in Transylvania −− said he was not at liberty to do so −− and repeatedly exclaimed: \"Oh! if M. lePrefect were only here!\" He was told to go to the Prefect at Cherbourg, but refused upon the ground that hispresence was needed in Paris. He time and again averred his conviction that he was a doomed man, andshowed himself both vacillating and irresolute in his conduct, and extremely nervous. He was told that he wasperfectly safe, since De Lassa and all his household were under constant surveillance; to which he replied, Nightmare TalesAN UNSOLVED MYSTERY9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\"You do not know the man.\" An inspector was detailed to accompany Delessert, never to lose sight of himnight and day, and guard him carefully; and proper precautions were taken in regard to his food and drink,while the guards watching De Lassa were doubled. On the morning of the third day, Delessert, who had been staying chiefly indoors, avowed his determinationto go at once and telegraph to M. le Prefect to return immediately. With this intention he and his brotherofficer started out. Just as they got to the corner of the Rue de Lanery and the Boulevard, Delessert stoppedsuddenly and put his hand to his forehead. \"My God!\" he cried, \"the crystal! the picture!\" and fell prone upon his face, insensible. He was taken at onceto a hospital, but only lingered a few hours, never regaining his consciousness. Under express instructionfrom the authorities, a most careful, minute, and thorough autopsy was made of Delessert's body by severaldistinguished surgeons, whose unanimous opinion was, that the cause of his death was apoplexy, due tofatigue and nervous excitement. As soon as Delessert was sent to the hospital, his brother inspector hurried to the Central Office, and DeLassa, together with his wife and everyone connected with the establishment, were at once arrested. De Lassasmiled contemptuously as they took him away. \"I knew you were coming; I prepared for it; you will be gladto release me again.\" It was quite true that De Lassa had prepared for them. When the house was searched it was found that everypaper had been burned, the crystal globe was destroyed, and in the room of the seances was a great heap ofdelicate machinery broken into indistinguishable bits. \"That cost me 200,000 francs,\" said De Lassa, pointingto the pile, \"but it has been a good investment.\" The walls and floors were ripped out in several places, andthe damage to the property was considerable. In prison neither De Lassa nor his associates made anyrevelations. The notion that they had something to do with Delessert's death was quickly dispelled, in a legalpoint of view, and all the party but De Lassa were released. He was still detained in prison, upon one pretext,or another, when one morning he was found hanging by a silk sash to the cornice of the room where he wasconfined −− dead. The night before, it was afterwards discovered, Madame de Lassa had eloped with a tallfootman, taking the Nubian Sidi with them. De Lassa's secrets died with him. −−−−−−−− \"It is an interesting story, that article of yours in to−day's Scientist. But is it a record of facts, or a tissue of theimagination? If true, why not state the source of it, in other words, specify your authority for it.\" The above is not signed, but we would take the opportunity to say that the story, \"An Unsolved Mystery,\"was published because we considered the main points of the narrative −− the prophecies, and the singulardeath of the officer −− to be psychic phenomena, that have been, and can be, again produced. Why quote\"authorities\"? The Scriptures tell us of the death of Ananias, under the stern rebuke from Peter; here we havea phenomenon of a similar nature. Ananias is supposed to have suffered instant death from fear. Few canrealize this power governed by spiritual laws, but those who have trod the boundary line and know some fewof the things that can be done, will see no great mystery in this, nor in the story published last week. We arenot speaking in mystical tones. Ask the powerful mesmerist if there is danger that the subject may pass out ofhis control? −− if he could will the spirit out, never to return? It is capable of demonstration that themesmerist can act on a subject at a distance of many miles; and it is no less certain that, the majority ofmesmerists know little or nothing of the laws that govern their powers. It may be a pleasant dream to attempt to conceive of the beauties of the spirit−world; but the time can bespent more profitably in a study of the spirit itself, and it is not necessary that the subject for study should bein the spirit−world.

They offer theirgranite breast to the fierce blows of the north−west wind and thus protect the dwellings of the rich that nestleat their foot on the inland side. The half−ruined cottages on the open shore are the insufficient shelter of thepoor. Their squalid bodies are often crushed under the walls torn and washed down by wind and angry wave.But they only follow the great law of the survival of the fittest. Why should they be protected? Lovely is the morning when the sun dawns with golden amber tints and its first rays kiss the cliffs of thebeautiful shore.

When it comes to the last but one, it sees a blood−stained handdoing endless deeds of cruelty and treachery, and it shudders. . . . . . . Guileless victims arise around it, andcry to Orlog for vengeance. \"What is my immediate Present?\" asks the dismayed Soul of Werdandi, the second sister. \"The decree of Orlog is on thyself!\" is the answer. \"But Orlog does not pronounce them blindly, as foolishmortals have it.\" Nightmare TalesX18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"\"What is my Future?\" asks despairingly of Skuld, the third Norn sister, the Soul−Ego. \"Is it to be for everdark with tears, and bereaved of Hope?\" . . .

TheSoul−Ego finds itself on a, to it, long familiar spot, the royal bower, and the seat opposite the brokenpalm−tree. Before it stretches, as formerly, the vast blue expanse of waters, glassing the rocks and cliffs;there, too, is the lonely palm, doomed to quick disappearance. The soft mellow voice of the incessant ripple of the light waves now assumes human speech, and reminds theSoul−Ego of the vows formed more than once on that spot.

He is suddenly transported into what looks a fairy−like Hall, lit with most glowing lights and built ofmaterials, the like of which he had never seen before. He perceives the heirs and descendants of all themonarchs of the globe gathered in that Hall in one happy family. They wear no longer the insignia of royalty,but, as he seems to know, those who are the reigning Princes, reign by virtue of their personal merits. It is thegreatness of heart, the nobility of character, their superior qualities of observation, wisdom, love of Truth andJustice, that have raised them to the dignity of heirs to the Thrones, of Kings and Queens. The crowns, byauthority and the grace of God, have been thrown off, and they now rule by \"the grace of divine humanity,\"chosen unanimously by recognition of their fitness to rule, and the reverential love of their voluntary subjects. All around seems strangely changed. Ambition, grasping greediness or envy −− miscalled Patriotism −− existno longer. Cruel selfishness has made room for just altruism and cold indifference to the wants of themillions no longer finds favour in the sight of the favoured few. Useless luxury, sham pretences −− social andreligious −− all has disappeared. No more wars are possible, for the armies are abolished. Soldiers haveturned into diligent, hard−working tillers of the ground, and the whole globe echoes his song in rapturous joy.Kingdoms and countries around him live like brothers.

A title is supposed to express the object in view, symbolising, as it were, thecontent of the paper. Since allegory is the soul of Eastern philosophy, it may be objected that nothing can beseen in the name \"Le Lotus Bleu,\" save that of a water plant −− the Nymphea Cerulea or Nelumbo.Furthermore a reader of this calibre would see but the blue colour of the list of contents of our journal. To avoid a like misunderstanding, we shall attempt to initiate our readers into the general symbolism of thelotus and the particular symbolism of the Blue Lotus. This mysterious and sacred plant has been consideredthrough the ages, both in Egypt and in India, as a symbol of the Universe. Not a monument in the valley ofthe Nile, not a papyrus, without this plant in an honoured place. On the capitals of the Egyptian pillars, on thethrones and even the head−dresses of the Divine Kings, the lotus is everywhere found as a symbol of theUniverse. It inevitably became an indispensable attribute of every creative god, as of every creative goddess,the latter being, philosophically considered, only the feminine aspect of the god, at first androgynous,afterwards male. It is from Padma−Yoni, \"the bosom of the Lotus,\" from Absolute Space, or from the Universe outside timeand space, that emanates the Cosmos, conditioned and limited by time and space. The Hiranya Garbha, \"theegg\" (or the womb) of gold, from which Brahma emerges, is often called the Heavenly Lotus. The God,Vishnu, −− the synthesis of the Trimurti or Hindu Trinity −− during the \"nights of Brahma\" floats asleep onthe primordial waters, stretched on the blossom of a lotus. His Goddess, the lovely Lakshmi, rising from thebosom of the waters, like Venus−Aphrodite, has a white lotus beneath her feet. It was at the churning of theOcean of Milk −− symbol of space and of the Milky Way −− by the Gods assembled together, that Lakshmi,Goddess of Beauty and Mother of Love (Kama) formed of the froth of the foaming waves, appeared beforethe astonished Gods, borne on a lotus, and holding another lotus in her hand. Thus have arisen the two chief titles of Lakshmi; Padma the Lotus, and Kshirabdi−tanaya daughter of theOcean of Milk. Gautama the Buddha has never been degraded to the level of a god, notwithstanding the factthat he was the first mortal within historical times fearless enough to interrogate that dumb Sphinx, which wecall the Universe, and to wrest completely therefrom the secrets of Life and Death. Though he has never beendeified, we repeat, yet he has nevertheless been recognised by generations in Asia as Lord of the Universe.This is why the conqueror and master of the world of thought and philosophy is represented as seated on a Nightmare TalesTHE LEGEND OF THE BLUE LOTUS20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"lotus in full bloom, emblem of the Universe thought out by him. In India and Ceylon the lotus is generally ofa golden hue; amongst the Buddhists of the North, it is blue. But there exists in one part of the world a third kind of lotus −− the Zizyphus. He who eats of it forgets of hisfatherland and those who are dear to him, so say the ancients. Let us not follow this example. Let us notforget our spiritual home, the cradle of the human race, and the birthplace of the Blue Lotus. Let us then raise the veil of oblivion which covers one of the most ancient allegories −− a Vedic legendwhich, however, the Brahman chroniclers have preserved. Only as the chroniclers have recounted the legendeach after his own manner, aided by variations* of his own, we have given the story here −− not according tothe incomplete renderings and translations of these Eastern gentlemen but according to the popular version.(* Cf. the history of Sunahsepha in the Bhagavata, IX, XVI, 35 and of the Ramayana, Bk. I. Cap. 60; Manu,X, 105; Koulouka Bhatta [the Historian]; Bahwruba and the Aitareya Brahmanas; Vishnu Purana, etc., etc.Each book gives its own version.) Thus is it that the old bards of Rajasthan sing it, when they come and seatthemselves in the verandah of the traveller's bungalow in the wet evenings of the rainy season. Let us leavethen the Orientalists to their fantastic speculations. How does it concern us whether the father of the selfishand cowardly prince, who was the cause of the transformation of the white lotus into the blue lotus, be calledHarischandra or Ambarisha? Names have nothing to do with the naive poetry of the legend, nor with itsmoral −− for there is a moral to be found if looked for well. We shall soon see that the chief episode in thestory is curiously reminiscent of another legend −− that of the story of Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac inthe Bible. Is not this one more proof that the Secret Doctrine of the East may have good reason to maintainthat the name of the Patriarch was neither a Chaldean or a Hebrew name, but rather an epithet and a Sanskritsurname, signifying abram, i.e., one is non−Brahman,* a debrahmanised Brahman, one who is degraded orwho has lost his caste? After this how can we avoid suspecting that we may find, among the modern Jews,the Chaldeans of the time of the Rishi Agastya −− these makers of bricks whose persecution began from eighthundred to a thousand years ago, but who emigrated to Chaldea four thousand years before the Christian era−− when so many of the popular legends of Southern India resemble the Bible stories. Louis Jacolliot speaksin several of his twenty−one volumes on Brahmanical India of this matter, and for once he is right. * The particle a in the Sanskrit word shews this clearly. Placed before a substantive thisparticle always means the negation or the opposite of the meaning of the expression thatfollows. Thus Sura (god) written a −Sura, becomes non−God, or the devil, Vidya isknowledge, and a−Vidya, ignorance or the opposite of knowledge, etc., etc. We will speak of it another time. Meanwhile here is the Legend of THE BLUE LOTUSCentury after century has passed away since Ambarisha, King of Ayodhya, reigned in the city founded by theholy Manu, Vaivasvata, the offspring of the Sun. The King was a Suryavansi (a descendant of the SolarRace), and he avowed himself a most faithful servant of the God, Varuna, the greatest and most powerfuldeity in the Rig−Veda.* But the god had denied male heirs to his worshipper, and this made the king veryunhappy. * It is only much later in the orthodox Pantheon and the symbolical polytheism of theBrahmans that Varuna became Poseidon or Neptune −− which he is now. In the Vedas he isthe most ancient of the Gods, identical with Ouranos of the Greek, that is to say apersonification of the celestial space and the infinite gods, the creator and ruler of heaven andearth, the King, the Father and the Master of the world, of gods and of men. Hesiod's Uranusand the Greek Zeus are one. Nightmare TalesTHE BLUE LOTUS21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"\"Alas!\" he wailed, every morning while performing his puja to the lesser gods, \"alas! What avails it to be thegreatest king on earth when God denies me an heir of my blood. When I am dead and placed on the funeralpyre, who will fulfil the pious duties of a son, and shatter my lifeless skull to liberate my soul from its earthlytrammels? What strange hand will at the full moon−tide place the rice of the Shraddha ceremony to doreverence to my shade? Will not the very birds of death [Rooks and ravens] themselves turn from the funeralfeast? For, surely, my shade earthbound in its great despair will not permit them to partake of it.\" * The Shradda is a ceremony observed by the nearest relatives of the deceased for the ninedays following the death. Once upon a time it was a magical ceremony. Now, however, inaddition to other practices, it mainly consists of scattering balls of cooked rice before thedoor of the dead man's house. If the crows promptly eat the rice it is a sign that the soul isliberated and at rest. If these birds which are so greedy did not touch the food, it was a proofthat the pisacha or bhut (shade) is present and is preventing them. Undoubtedly the Shraddais a superstition, but certainly not more so than Novenas or masses for the Dead. The King was thus bewailing, when his family priest inspired him with the idea of making a vow. If Godshould send him two or more sons, he would promise God to sacrifice to Him at a public ceremony the eldestborn when he should have attained the age of puberty. Attracted by this promise of a burnt−offering of flesh −− a savory odour very agreeable to the Great Gods −−Varuna accepted the promise of the King, and the happy Ambarisha had a son, followed by several others.The eldest son, the heir to the throne for the time being, was called Rohita (the red) and was surnamedDevarata −− which, literally translated, means God−given. Devarata grew up and soon became a veritablePrince Charming, but if we are to believe the legends he was as selfish and deceitful as he was beautiful. When the Prince had attained the appointed age, the God speaking through the mouth of the same CourtPriest, charged the King to keep his promise; but when each time Ambarisha invented some excuse topostpone the hour of sacrifice, the God at last grew annoyed. Being a jealous and angry God, he threatenedthe King with all His Divine wrath. For a long time, neither commands nor threats produced the desired effect. As long as there were sacred cowsto be transferred from the royal cowsheds to those of the Brahmans, as long as there was money in theTreasury to fill the Temple crypts, the Brahmans succeeded in keeping Varuna quiet. But when there were nomore cows, when there was no more money, the God threatened to overthrow the King, his palace and hisheirs, and if they escaped, to burn them alive. The poor King, finding himself at the end of his resources,summoned his first−born and informed him of the fate which awaited him. But Devarata lent a deaf ear tothese tidings. He refused to submit to the double weight of the paternal and divine will. So, when the sacrificial fires had been lighted and all the good towns−folk of Ayodhya had gathered together,full of emotion, the heir−apparent was absent from the festival. He had concealed himself in the forests of the Yogis. Now, these forests had been inhabited by holy hermits, and Devarata knew that there be would beunassailable and impregnable. He might be seen there, but no one could do him violence −− not even the GodVaruna Himself. It was a simple solution. The religious austerities of the Aranyakas (the holy men of theforests) several of whom were Daityas (Titans, a race of giants and demons), gave them such dominance thatall the Gods trembled before their sway and their supernatural powers −− even Varuna, himself. These antediluvian Yogis, it seems, had the power to destroy even the God Himself, at will −− possiblybecause they had invented Him themselves. Nightmare TalesTHE BLUE LOTUS22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Devarata spent several years in the forests; at last he grew tired of the life. Allowing it to be understood thathe could satisfy Varuna by finding a substitute, who would sacrifice himself in his place, provided that thesacrificial victim was the son of a Rishi, he started on his journey and finally discovered that he sought. In the country which lies around the flower−covered shores of the renowned Pushkara, there was once afamine, and a very holy man, named Ajigarta,* was at the point of death from starvation, likewise all hisfamily. He had several sons of whom the second, Sunahsepha, a virtuous young man, was himself alsopreparing to become a Rishi. Taking advantage of his poverty and thinking with good reason that a hungrystomach would be a more ready listener than a satisfied one, the crafty Devarata made the father acquaintedwith his history. After this he offered him a hundred cows in exchange for Sunahsepha, a substituteburnt−offering on the altar of the Gods. * Others call him Rishika and call King Ambarisha, Harischandra, the famous sovereign whowas a paragon of all the virtues. The virtuous father refused at first point−blank, but the gentle Sunahsepha offered himself of his own accord,and thus addressed his father: \"Of what importance is the life of one man, when it can save that of manyothers. This God is a great god and His pity is infinite; but He is also a very jealous god and His wrath isswift and vengeful. Varuna is the Lord of Terror, and Death is obedient to His command. His spirit will notfor ever strive with one who is disobedient to Him. He will repent Him that He has created man, and then willburn alive a hundred thousand lakhs* of innocent people (*A lakh is a measure of 100,000, whether men orpieces of money be in question.), because of one man who is guilty. If His victim should escape Him, He willsurely dry up our rivers, set fire to our lands and destroy our women who are with child −− in His infinitekindness. Let me then sacrifice myself, oh! my father, in place of this stranger who offers us a hundred cows.That sum would prevent thee and my brothers from dying of hunger and will save thousands of others from aterrible death. At this price the giving up of life is a pleasant thing.\" The aged Rishi shed some tears, but he ended by giving his consent and began to prepare the sacrificialpyre.* *Manu (Book X, 105) alluding to this story remarks that Ajigarta, the holy Rishi, committedno sin in selling the life of his son, since the sacrifice preserved his life and that of all thefamily. This reminds us of another legend, more modern, that might serve as a parallel to theolder one. Did not the Count Ugolino, condemned to die of starvation in his dungeon, eat hisown children \"to preserve for them a father\"? The popular legend of Sunahsepha is morebeautiful than the commentary of Manu −− evidently an interpolation of some Brahmans infalsified manuscripts. The Pushkara lake* was one of the spots of this earth favoured by the Goddess, Lakshmi−Padma (WhiteLotus); she often plunged into the fresh waters that she might visit her eldest sister, Varuni, the consort of theGod Varuna.** Lakshmi−Padma heard the proposal of Devarata, witnessed the despair of the father, andadmired the filial devotion of Sunahsepha. Filled with pity, the Mother of Love and Compassion sent for theRishi Visvamitra, one of the seven primordial Manus and a son of Brahma, and succeeded in interesting himin the lot of her protege. The great Rishi promised her his aid. Appearing to Sunahsepha, but unseen by allothers, he taught him two sacred verses (mantras) of the Rig−Veda, making him promise to recite these onthe pyre. Now, he who utters these two mantras (invocations) forces the whole assembly of the Gods, withIndra at their head, to come to his rescue, and because of this becomes a Rishi himself in this life or in hisnext incarnation. * This lake is sometimes called in our day Pokker. It is I place famous for a yearlypilgrimage, and is charmingly situated five English miles from Ajmeer in Rajisthan.

Ofthe \"fourteen precious objects\" produced by the churning, she appeared the second andLakshmi the last, preceded by the Chalice of Anmita, the nectar which gives immortality. The altar was set up on the shore of the lake, the pyre was prepared and the crowd had assembled. After hehad laid his son on the perfumed sandal wood and bound him, Ajigarta equipped himself with the knife ofsacrifice. He was just raising his trembling arm above the heart of his well−beloved son, when the boy beganto chant the sacred verses. There was again a moment of hesitation and supreme grief, and as the boy finishedhis mantram, the aged Rishi plunged his knife into the breast of Sunahsepha. But, oh! the miracle of it! At that very moment Indra, the God of the Blue Vault (the Universe) issued fromthe heavens and descended right into the midst of the ceremony. Enveloping the pyre and the victim in a thickblue mist, he loosed the ropes which held the youth captive. It seemed as if a corner of the azure heavens hadlowered itself over the spot, illuminating the whole country and colouring with a golden blue the wholescene. Filled with terror, the crowd, and even the Rishi himself, fell on their faces, half dead with fear. When they came to themselves, the mist had disappeared and a complete change of scene had been wrought. The fires of the funeral pyre had rekindled of themselves, and stretched thereon was seen a hind (Rohit)*which was none else than the Prince Rohita, Devarata, who, pierced to the heart with the knife he haddirected against another, was burning as a sacrifice for his sin. * A play upon words. Rohit in Sanskrit is the Dame of the female of the deer, the hind, andRohita means \"red\". It was because of his cowardice and fear of death that he was changed,according to the legend, into a hind by the Gods. Some little way apart from the altar, also lying stretched out, but on a bed of Lotuses, peacefully sleptSunahsepha; and in the place on his breast where the knife had descended was seen to bloom a beautiful bluelotus. The Pushkara lake, itself, covered a moment before with white lotuses, whose petals shone in the sunlike silver cups full of Amrita's waters [The Elixir which confers Immortality.], now reflected the azure of theheavens −− the white lotuses had become blue. Then like to the sound of the Vina [A species of the Lute.

It is the younger son of a mendicant ascetic who willbecome the King and reign in his stead.\" A murmur of approbation set in movement the flowery carpet that overspread the lake. Opening to the goldensunlight their hearts of blue, the lotuses smiled with joy and wafted a hymn of perfume to Surya, their Sunand Master.

Because of this decree, Sunahsepha was born in his next incarnation in the royal family of Ayodha andreigned over the Solar race for 84,000 years. With regard to Rohita −− Devarata or God−given as he was −− he fulfilled the lot which Lakshmi Padma hadvowed.

P. Blavatsky INTRODUCTIONIt was a dark, chilly night in September, 1884. A heavy gloom had descended over the streets of A−−−, asmall town on the Rhine, and was hanging like a black funeral−pall over the dull factory burgh. The greaternumber of its inhabitants, wearied by their long day's work, had hours before retired to stretch their tiredlimbs, and lay their aching heads upon their pillows. All was quiet in the large house; all was quiet in thedeserted streets. I too was lying in my bed; alas, not one of rest, but of pain and sickness, to which I had been confined forsome days. So still was everything in the house, that, as Longfellow has it, its stillness seemed almostaudible. I could plainly hear the murmur of the blood as it rushed through my aching body, producing thatmonotonous singing so familiar to one who lends a watchful ear to silence. I had listened to it until, in mynervous imagination, it had grown into the sound of a distant cataract, the fall of mighty waters . . . when,suddenly changing its character, the evergrowing \"singing\" merged into other and far more welcome sounds. Nightmare TalesA BEWITCHED LIFE25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"It was the low, and at first scarce audible, whisper of a human voice. It approached, and graduallystrengthening seemed to speak in my very ear. Thus sounds a voice speaking across a blue quiescent lake, inone of those wondrously acoustic gorges of the snow−capped mountains, where the air is so pure that a wordpronounced half a mile off seems almost at the elbow. Yes; it was the voice of one whom to know is toreverence; of one, to me, owing to many mystic associations, most dear and holy; a voice familiar for longyears and ever welcome; doubly so in hours of mental or physical suffering, for it always brings with it a rayof hope and consolation. \"Courage,\" it whispered in gentle, mellow tones. \"Think of the days passed by you in sweet associations; ofthe great lessons received of Nature's truths; of the many errors of men concerning these truths; and try to addto them the experience of a night in this city. Let the narrative of a strange life, that will interest you, help toshorten the hours of suffering. . . . . . Give your attention. Look yonder before you!\" \"Yonder\" meant the clear, large windows of an empty house on the other side of the narrow street of theGerman town. They faced my own in almost a straight line across the street, and my bed faced the windowsof my sleeping room. Obedient to the suggestion, I directed my gaze towards them, and what I saw made mefor the time being forget the agony of the pain that racked my swollen arm and rheumatical body. Over the windows was creeping a mist; a dense, heavy, serpentine, whitish mist, that looked like the hugeshadow of a gigantic boa slowly uncoiling its body. Gradually it disappeared, to leave a lustrous light, softand silvery, as though the window−panes behind reflected a thousand moonbeams, a tropical star−lit sky −−first from outside, then from within the empty rooms. Next I saw the mist elongating itself and throwing, as itwere, a fairy bridge across the street from the bewitched windows to my own balcony, nay, to my very ownbed. As I continued gazing, the wall and windows and the opposite house itself, suddenly vanished. Thespace occupied by the empty rooms had changed into the interior of another smaller room, in what I knew tobe a Swiss chalet −− into a study, whose old, dark walls were covered from floor to ceiling with book shelveson which were many antiquated folios, as well as works of a more recent date. In the centre stood a largeold−fashioned table, littered over with manuscripts and writing materials. Before it, quill−pen in hand, sat anold man; a grim−looking, skeleton−like personage, with a face so thin, so pale, yellow and emaciated, that thelight of the solitary little student's lamp was reflected in two shining spots on his high cheekbones, as thoughthey were carved out of ivory. As I tried to get a better view of him by slowly raising myself upon my pillows, the whole vision, chalet andstudy, desk, books and scribe, seemed to flicker and move. Once set in motion, they approached nearer andnearer, until, gliding noiselessly along the fleecy bridge of clouds across the street, they floated through theclosed windows into my room and finally seemed to settle beside my bed. \"Listen to what he thinks and is going to write\" −− said in soothing tones the same familiar, far off, and yetnear voice.\" Thus you will hear a narrative, the telling of which may help to shorten the long sleepless hours,and even make you forget for a while your pain . . . Try!\" −− it added, using the well−known Rosicrucian andKabalistic formula. I tried, doing as I was bid. I centred all my attention on the solitary laborious figure that I saw before me, butwhich did not see me. At first, the noise of the quill−pen with which the old man was writing, suggested tomy mind nothing more than a low whispered murmur of a nondescript nature. Then, gradually, my ear caughtthe indistinct words of a faint and distant voice, and I thought the figure before me, bending over itsmanuscript, was reading its tale aloud instead of writing it. But I soon found out my error. For casting mygaze at the old scribe's face, I saw at a glance that his lips were compressed and motionless, and the voice toothin and shrill to be his voice. Stranger still at every word traced by the feeble, aged hand, I noticed a lightflashing from under his pen, a bright coloured spark that became instantaneously a sound, or −− what is thesame thing −− it seemed to do so to my inner perceptions. It was indeed the small voice of the quill that I Nightmare TalesA BEWITCHED LIFE26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"heard though scribe and pen were at the time, perchance, hundreds of miles away from Germany. Such thingswill happen occasionally, especially at night, beneath whose starry shade, as Byron tells us, \" . . . we learn the language of another world . . .\" However it may be, the words uttered by the quill remained in my memory for days after. Nor had I any greatdifficulty in retaining them, for when I sat down to record the story, I found it, as usual, indelibly impressedon the astral tablets before my inner eye. Thus, I had but to copy it and so give it as I received it. I failed to learn the name of the unknown nocturnalwriter.

Some people might be inclined to regard these events as providential: I, however,believe in no Providence, and yet am unable to attribute them to mere chance. I connect them as the ceaselessevolution of effects, engendered by certain direct causes, with one primary and fundamental cause, fromwhich ensued all that followed. A feeble old man am I now, yet physical weakness has in no way impared mymental faculties. I remember the smallest details of that terrible cause, which engendered such fatal results. Itis these which furnish me with an additional proof of the actual existence of one whom I fain would regard−− oh, that I could do so! −− as a creature born of my fancy, the evanescent production of a feverish, horriddream! Oh that terrible, mild and all−forgiving, that saintly and respected Being! It was that paragon of allthe virtues who embittered my whole existence. It is he, who, pushing me violently out of the monotonousbut secure groove of daily life, was the first to force upon me the certitude of a life hereafter, thus adding anadditional horror to one already great enough. With a view to a clearer comprehension of the situation, I must interrupt these recollections with a few wordsabout myself. Oh how, if I could, would I obliterate that hated Self!Born in Switzerland, of French parents, who centred the whole world−wisdom in the literary trinity ofVoltaire, J. J. Rousseau and D'Holbach, and educated in a German university, I grew up a thoroughmaterialist, a confirmed atheist. I could never have even pictured to myself any beings −− least of all a Being−− above or even outside visible nature, as distinguished from her. Hence I regarded everything that couldnot be brought under the strictest analysis of the physical senses as a mere chimera. A soul, I argued, evensupposing man has one, must be material. According to Origen's definition, incorporeus −− the epithet hegave to his God −− signifies a substance only more subtle than that of physical bodies, of which, at best, wecan form no definite idea. How then can that, of which our senses cannot enable us to obtain any clearknowledge, how can that make itself visible or produce any tangible manifestations? Accordingly, I received the tales of nascent Spiritualism with a feeling of utter contempt, and regarded theovertures made by certain priests with derision, often akin to anger. And indeed the latter feeling has neverentirely abandoned me. Nightmare TalesI −− THE STRANGER'S STORY27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Pascal, in the eighth Act of his \" Thoughts,\" confesses to a most complete incertitude upon the existence ofGod. Throughout my life, I too professed a complete certitude as to the non−existence of any suchextra−cosmic being, and repeated with that great thinker the memorable words in which he tells us: \"I haveexamined if this God of whom all the world speaks might not have left some marks of himself. I lookeverywhere, and everywhere I see nothing but obscurity. Nature offers me nothing that may not be a matterof doubt and inquietude.\" Nor have I found to this day anything that might unsettle me in precisely similarand even stronger feelings. I have never believed, nor shall I ever believe, in a Supreme Being. But at thepotentialities of man, proclaimed far and wide in the East, powers so developed in some persons as to makethem virtually Gods, at them I laugh no more. My whole broken life is a protest against such negation. Ibelieve in such phenomena, and −− I curse them, whenever they come, and by whatsoever means generated. On the death of my parents, owing to an unfortunate lawsuit, I lost the greater part of my fortune, andresolved −− for the sake of those I loved best, rather than for my own −− to make another for myself. Myelder sister, whom I adored, had married a poor man. I accepted the offer of a rich Hamburg firm and sailedfor Japan as its junior partner. For several years my business went on successfully. I got into the confidence of many influential Japanese,through whose protection I was enabled to travel and transact business in many localities, which, in thosedays especially, were not easily accessible to foreigners. Indifferent to every religion, I became interested inthe philosophy of Buddhism, the only religious system I thought worthy of being called philosophical. Thus,in my moments of leisure, I visited the most remarkable temples of Japan, the most important and curious ofthe ninety−six Buddhist monasteries of Kioto. I have examined in turn Day −− Bootzoo, with its giganticbell; Tzeonene, Enarino−Yassero, Kie−Missoo, Higadzi−Hong−Vonsi, and many other famous temples. Several years passed away, and during that whole period I was not cured of my scepticism, nor did I evercontemplate having my opinions on this subject altered. I derided the pretensions of the Japanese bonzes andascetics, as I had those of Christian priests and European Spiritualists. I could not believe in the acquisition ofpowers unknown to, and never studied by, men of science; hence I scoffed at all such ideas. The superstitiousand atrabilious Buddhist, teaching us to shun the pleasures of life, to put to rout one's passions, to renderoneself insensible alike to happiness and suffering, in order to acquire such chimerical powers −− seemedsupremely ridiculous in my eyes. On a day ever memorable to me −− a fatal day −− I made the acquaintance of a venerable and learned Bonze,a Japanese priest, named Tamoora Hideyeri. I met him at the foot of the golden Kwon−On, and from thatmoment he became my best and most trusted friend. Notwithstanding my great and genuine regard for him,however, whenever a good opportunity was offered I never failed to mock his religious convictions, therebyvery often hurting his feelings. But my old friend was as meek and forgiving as any true Buddhist's heart might desire. He never resented myimpatient sarcasms, even when they were, to say the least, of equivocal propriety, and generally limited hisreplies to the \"wait and see\" kind of protest. Nor could he be brought to seriously believe in the sincerity ofmy denial of the existence of any God or Gods. The full meaning of the terms \"atheism\" and \"scepticism\"was beyond the comprehension of his otherwise extremely intellectual and acute mind. Like certainreverential Christians, he seemed incapable of realizing that any man of sense should prefer the wiseconclusions arrived at by philosophy and modern science to a ridiculous belief in an invisible world full ofGods and spirits, dzins and demons. \"Man is a spiritual being,\" he insisted, \"who returns to earth more thanonce, and is rewarded or punished in the between times.\" The proposition that man is nothing else but a heapof organized dust, was beyond him. Like Jeremy Collier, he refused to admit that he was no better than \"astalking machine, a speaking head without a soul in it,\" whose \"thoughts\" are all bound by the laws ofmotion.\" \"For,\" he argued, \"if my actions were, as you say, prescribed beforehand, and I had no more libertyor free will to change the course of my action than the running waters of the river yonder, then the glorious Nightmare TalesI −− THE STRANGER'S STORY28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"doctrine of Karma, of merit and demerit, would be a foolishness indeed.\" Thus the whole of my hyper−metaphysical friend's ontology rested on the shaky superstructure ofmetempsychosis, of a fancied \"just\" Law of Retribution, and other such equally absurd dreams. \"We cannot,\" said he paradoxically one day, \"hope to live hereafter in the full enjoyment of ourconsciousness, unless we have built for it beforehand a firm and solid foundation of spirituality. . . . . . Nay,laugh not, friend of no faith,\" he meekly pleaded, \"but rather think and reflect on this. One who has nevertaught himself to live in Spirit during his conscious and responsible life on earth, can hardly hope to enjoy asentient existence after death, when, deprived of his body, he is limited to that Spirit alone.\" \"What can you mean by life in Spirit?\" −− I enquired. \"Life on a spiritual plane; that which the Buddhists call Tushita Devaloka (Paradise). Man can create such ablissful existence for himself between two births, by the gradual transference on to that plane of all thefaculties which during his sojourn on earth manifest through his organic body and, as you call it, animalbrain.\" \"How absurd! And how can man do this?\" \"Contemplation and a strong desire to assimilate the blessed Gods, will enable him to do so.\" \"And if man refuses this intellectual occupation, by which you mean, I suppose, the fixing of the eyes on thetip of his nose, what becomes of him after the death of his body?\" was my mocking question. \"He will be dealt with according to the prevailing state of his consciousness, of which there are many grades.At best −− immediate rebirth; at worst −− the state of avitchi, a mental hell. Yet one need not be an ascetic toassimilate spiritual life which will extend to the hereafter. All that is required is to try and approach Spirit.\" \"How so? Even when disbelieving in it?\" −− I rejoined. \"Even so! One may disbelieve and yet harbour in one's nature room for doubt, however small that room maybe, and thus try one day, were it but for one moment, to open the door of the inner temple; and this will provesufficient for the purpose.\" \"You are decidedly poetical, and paradoxical to boot, reverend sir. Will you kindly explain to me a little moreof the mystery?\" \"There is none; still I am willing. Suppose for a moment that some unknown temple to which you have neverbeen before, and the existence of which you think you have reasons to deny, is the 'spiritual plane' of which Iam speaking. Some one takes you by the hand and leads you towards its entrance, curiosity makes you openits door and look within. By this simple act, by entering it for one second, you have established an everlastingconnection between your consciousness and the temple. You cannot deny its existence any longer, norobliterate the fact of your having entered it. And according to the character and the variety of your work,within its holy precincts, so will you live in it after your consciousness is severed from its dwelling of flesh.\" \"What do you mean? And what has my after−death consciousness −− if such a thing exists −− to do with thetemple?\" \"It has everything to do with it,\" solemnly rejoined the old man. \"There can be no self−consciousness afterdeath outside the temple of spirit. That which you will have done within its plane will alone survive. All the Nightmare TalesI −− THE STRANGER'S STORY29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"rest is false and an illusion. It is doomed to perish in the Ocean of Maya.\" Amused at the idea of living outside one's body, I urged on my old friend to tell me more. Mistaking mymeaning the venerable man willingly consented. Tamoora Hideyeri belonged to the great temple of Tzionene, a Buddhist monastery, famous not only in allJapan, but also throughout Tibet and China. No other is so venerated in Kioto. Its monks belong to the sect ofDzeno−doo, and are considered as the most learned among the many erudite fraternities. They are, moreover,closely connected and allied with the Yamabooshi (the ascetics, or hermits), who follow the doctrines ofLao−tze. No wonder, that at the slightest provocation on my part the priest flew into the highest metaphysics,hoping thereby to cure me of my infidelity. No use repeating here the long rigmarole of the most hopelessly involved and incomprehensible of alldoctrines. According to his ideas, we have to train ourselves for spirituality in another world −− as forgymnastics. Carrying on the analogy between the temple and the \"spiritual plane\" he tried to illustrate hisidea. He had himself worked in the temple of Spirit two−thirds of his life, and given several hours daily to\"contemplation.\" Thus he knew (!?) that after he had laid aside his mortal casket, \"a mere illusion,\" heexplained −− he would in his spiritual consciousness live over again every feeling of ennobling joy anddivine bliss he had ever had, or ought to have had −− only a hundredfold intensified. His work on thespirit−plane had been considerable, he said, and he hoped, therefore that the wages of the labourer wouldprove proportionate. \"But suppose the labourer, as in the example you have just brought forward in my case, should have no more,than opened the temple door out of mere curiosity; had only peeped into the sanctuary never to set his foottherein again. What then?\" \"Then,\" he answered, \"you would have only this short minute to record in your future self−consciousness andno more. Our life hereafter records and repeats but the impressions and feelings we have had in our spiritualexperiences and nothing else. Thus, if instead of reverence at the moment of entering the abode of Spirit, youhad been harbouring in your heart anger, jealousy or grief, then your future spiritual life would be a sad one,in truth. There would be nothing to record, save the opening of a door, in a fit of bad temper.\" \"How then could it be repeated?\" −− I insisted, highly amused. \"What do you suppose I would be doingbefore incarnating again?\" \"In that case,\" he said speaking slowly and weighing every word −− \"in that case, you would have I fear, onlyto open and shut the temple door, over and over again, during a period which, however short, would seem toyou an eternity.\" This kind of after−death occupation appeared to me, at that time, so grotesque in its sublime absurdity, that Iwas seized with an almost inextinguishable fit of laughter. My venerable friend looked considerably dismayed at such a result of his metaphysical instruction. He hadevidently not expected such hilarity. However, he said nothing, but only sighed and gazed at me withincreased benevolence and pity shining in his small black eyes. \"Pray excuse my laughter,\" I apologized. \"But really, now, you cannot seriously mean to tell me that the'spiritual state' you advocate and so firmly believe in, consists only in aping certain things we do in life?\" \"Nay, nay; not aping, but only intensifying their repetition; filling the gaps that were unjustly left unfilledduring life in the fruition of our acts and deeds, and of everything performed on the spiritual plane of the one Nightmare TalesI −− THE STRANGER'S STORY30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"real state.

This is all. I pray you may be spared such fruitless deeds and finally madeto see certain truths.\" And passing through the usual Japanese courtesies of taking leave the excellent mandeparted. Alas, alas! had I but known at the time what I have learnt since, how little would I have laughed, and howmuch more would I have learned! But as the matter stood, the more personal affection and respect I felt for him, the less could I becomereconciled to his wild ideas about an after−life, and especially as to the acquisition by some men ofsupernatural powers. I felt particularly disgusted with his reverence for the Yamabooshi, the allies of everyBuddhist sect in the land. Their claims to the \"miraculous\" were simply odious to my notions. To hear everyJap I knew at Kioto, even to my own partner, the shrewdest of all the business men I had come across in theEast −− mentioning these followers of Lao−tze with downcast eyes, reverentially folded hands, andaffirmations of their possessing \"great\" and \"wonderful\" gifts, was more than I was prepared to patientlytolerate in those days. And who were they, after all, these great magicians with their ridiculous pretensions tosuper−mundane knowledge; these \"holy beggars\" who, as I then thought, purposely dwell in the recesses ofunfrequented mountains and an unapproachable craggy steeps, so as the better to afford no chance to curiousintruders of finding them out and watching them in their own dens? Simply, impudent fortune−tellers,Japanese gypsies who sell charms and talismans, and no better. In answer to those who sought to assure methat though the Yamabooshi lead a mysterious life, admitting none of the profane to their secrets, they still doaccept pupils, however difficult it is for one to become their disciple, and that thus they have living witnessesto the great purity and sanctity of their lives, in answer to such affirmations I opposed the strongest negationand stood firmly by it. I insulted both masters and pupils, classing them under the same category of fools,when not knaves, and I went so far as to include in this number the Sintos. Now Sintoism or Sin−Syu, \"faithin the Gods, and in the way to the Gods,\" that is, belief in the communication between these creatures andmen, is a kind of worship of nature−spirits, than which nothing can be more miserably absurd. And byplacing the Sintos among the fools and knaves of other sects, I gained many enemies. For the Sinto Kanusi(spiritual teachers) are looked upon as the highest in the upper classes of Society, the Mikado himself being atthe head of their hierarchy and the members of the sect belonging to the most cultured and educated men inJapan. These Kanusi of the Sinto form no caste or class apart, nor do they pass any ordination −− at any ratenone known to outsiders. And as they claim publicly no special privilege or powers, even their dress being inno wise different from that of the laity, but are simply in the world's opinion professors and students of occultand spiritual sciences, I very often came in contact with them without in the least suspecting that I was in thepresence of such personages. II −− THE MYSTERIOUS VISITORYears passed; and as time went by, my ineradicable scepticism grew stronger and waxed fiercer every day. Ihave already mentioned an elder and much−beloved sister, my only surviving relative. She had married andhad lately gone to live at Nuremberg. I regarded her with feelings more filial than fraternal, and her childrenwere as dear to me as might have been my own. At the time of the great catastrophe that in the course of afew days had made my father lose his large fortune, and my mother break her heart, she it was, that sweet bigsister of mine, who had made herself of her own accord the guardian angel of our ruined family. Out of hergreat love for me, her younger brother, for whom she attempted to replace the professors that could no longerbe afforded, she had renounced her own happiness. She sacrificed herself and the man she loved, byindefinitely postponing their marriage, in order to help our father and chiefly myself by her undivided Nightmare TalesII −− THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"devotion. And, oh, how I loved and reverenced her, time but strengthening this earliest family affection! Theywho maintain that no atheist, as such, can be a true friend, an affectionate relative, or a loyal subject, utter −−whether consciously or unconsciously −− the greatest calumny and lie. To say that a materialist growshard−hearted as he grows older, that he cannot love as a believer does, is simply the greatest fallacy. There may be such exceptional cases, it is true, but these are found only occasionally in men who are evenmore selfish than they are sceptical, or vulgarly worldly. But when a man who is kindly disposed in hisnature, for no selfish motives but because of reason and love of truth, becomes what is called atheistical, he isonly strengthened in his family affections, and in his sympathies with his fellow men. All his emotions, allthe ardent aspirations towards the unseen and unreachable, all the love which he would otherwise haveuselessly bestowed on a supposititional heaven and its God, become now centred with tenfold force upon hisloved ones and mankind. Indeed, the atheist's heart alone −− . . . can know, What secret tides of still enjoyment flow When brothers love. . . . It was such holy fraternal love that led me also to sacrifice my comfort and personal welfare to secure herhappiness, the felicity of her who had been more than a mother to me. I was a mere youth when I left homefor Hamburg. There, working with all the desperate earnestness of a man who has but one noble object inview −− to relieve suffering, and help those whom he loves −− I very soon secured the confidence of myemployers, who raised me in consequence to the high post of trust I always enjoyed. My first real pleasureand reward in life was to see my sister married to the man she had sacrificed for my sake, and to help them intheir struggle for existence. So purifying and unselfish was this affection of mine for her that, when it came to be shared among herchildren, instead of losing in intensity by such division, it seemed to only grow the stronger. Born with thepotentiality of the warmest family affection in me, the devotion for my sister was so great, that the thought ofburning that sacred fire of love before any idol, save that of herself and family, never entered my head. Thiswas the only, church I recognized, the only church wherein I worshipped at the altar of holy family affection.In fact this large family of eleven persons, including her husband, was the only tie that attached me toEurope. Twice, during a period of nine years, had I crossed the ocean with the sole object of seeing andpressing these dear ones to my heart. I had no other business in the West; and having performed this pleasantduty, I returned each time to Japan to work and toil for them. For their sake I remained a bachelor, that thewealth I might acquire should go undivided to them alone. We had always corresponded as regularly as the long transit of the then very irregular service of themail−boats would permit. But suddenly there came a break in my letters from home. For nearly a year Ireceived no intelligence; and day by day, I became more restless, more apprehensive of some greatmisfortune. Vainly I looked for a letter, a simple message; and my efforts to account for so unusual a silencewere fruitless. \"Friend,\" said to me one day Tamoora Hideyeri, my only confidant, \"Friend, consult a holy Yamabooshi −−and you will feel at rest.\" Of course the offer was rejected with as much moderation as I could command under the provocation. But, assteamer after steamer came in without a word of news, I felt a despair which daily increased in depth andfixity. This finally degenerated into an irrepressible craving, a morbid desire to learn −− the worst, as I thenthought. I struggled hard with the feeling, but it had the best of me. Only a few months before a completemaster of myself −− I now became an abject slave to fear. A fatalist of the school of D'Holbach, I, who hadalways regarded belief in the system of necessity as being the only promoter of philosophical happiness, andas having the most advantageous influence over human weaknesses, I felt a craving for something akin to Nightmare TalesII −− THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"fortune−telling! I had gone so far as to forget the first principle of my doctrine −− the only one calculated tocalm our sorrows, to inspire us with a useful submission, namely a rational resignation to the decrees of blinddestiny, with which foolish sensibility causes us so often to be overwhelmed −− the doctrine that all isnecessary. Yes; forgetting this, I was drawn into a shameful, superstitious longing, a stupid, disgracefuldesire to learn −− if not futurity, at any rate that which was taking place at the other side of the globe. Myconduct seemed utterly modified, my temperament and aspirations wholly changed; and like a weak, nervousgirl, I caught myself straining my mind to the very verge of lunacy in an attempt to look −− as I had been toldone could sometimes do −− beyond the oceans, and learn, at last, the real cause of this long, inexplicablesilence! One evening, at sunset, my old friend, the venerable Bonze, Tamoora, appeared on the verandah of my lowwooden house. I had not visited him for many days, and he had come to know how I was. I took theopportunity to once more sneer at one, whom, in reality, I regarded with most affectionate respect. Withequivocal taste for which I repented almost before the words had been pronounced −− I enquired of him whyhe had taken the trouble to walk all that distance when he might have learned anything he liked about me bysimply interrogating a Yamabooshi? He seemed a little hurt, at first; but after keenly scrutinizing my dejectedface, he mildly remarked that he could only insist upon what he had advised before. Only one of that holyorder could give me consolation in my present state. From that instant, an insane desire possessed me to challenge him to prove his assertions. I defied −− I said tohim −− any and every one of his alleged magicians to tell me the name of the person I was thinking of, andwhat he was doing at that moment. He quietly answered that my desire could be easily satisfied. There was aYamabooshi two doors from me, visiting a sick Sinto. He would fetch him −− if I only said the word. I said it and from the moment of its utterance my doom was sealed.How shall I find words to describe the scene that followed! Twenty minutes after the desire had been soincautiously expressed, an old Japanese, uncommonly tall and majestic for one of that race, pale, thin andemaciated, was standing before me. There,, where I had expected to find servile obsequiousness, I onlydiscerned an air of calm and dignified composure, the attitude of one who knows his moral superiority, andtherefore scorns to notice the mistakes of those who fail to recognize it. To the somewhat irreverent andmocking questions, which I put to him one after another, with feverish eagerness, he made no reply; butgazed on me in silence as a physician would look at a delirious patient. From the moment he fixed −− hiseyes on mine, I felt −− or shall I say, saw −− as though it were a sharp ray of light, a thin silvery thread, shootout from the intensely black and narrow eyes so deeply sunk in the yellow old face. It seemed to penetrateinto my brain and heart like an arrow, and set to work to dig out. therefrom every thought and feeling. Yes; Iboth saw and felt it, and very soon the double sensation became intolerable. To break the spell I defied him to tell me what he had found in my thoughts. Calmly came the correct answer−− Extreme anxiety for a female relative, her husband and children, who were inhabiting a house the correctdescription of which he gave as though he knew it as well as myself. I turned a suspicious eye upon myfriend, the Bonze, to whose indiscretions, I thought, I was indebted for the quick reply. Rememberinghowever that Tamoora could know nothing of the appearance of my sister's house, that the Japanese areproverbially truthful and, as friends, faithful to death −− I felt ashamed of my suspicion. To atone for itbefore my own conscience I asked the hermit whether he could tell me anything of the present state of thatbeloved sister of mine. The foreigner −− was the reply −− would never believe in the words, or trust to theknowledge of any person but himself. Were the Yamabooshi to tell him, the impression would wear outhardly a few hours later, and the inquirer find himself as miserable as before. There was but one means; andthat was to make the foreigner (myself) see with his own eyes, and thus learn the truth for himself. Was theenquirer ready to be placed by a Yamabooshi, a stranger to him, in the required state?

Even in the midst of my never−ceasing mentalagony, I could not help smiling at the ridiculous nature of the operation I was willingly submitting to.Nevertheless I silently bowed consent. III −− PSYCHIC MAGICThe old Yamabooshi lost no time. He looked at the setting sun, and finding, probably, the LordTen−Dzio−Dai−Dzio (the Spirit who darts his Rays) propitious for the coming ceremony, he speedily drewout a little bundle. It contained a small lacquered box, a piece of vegetable paper, made from the bark of themulberry tree, and a pen, with which he traced upon the paper a few sentences in the Naiden character −− apeculiar style of written language used only for religious and mystical purposes. Having finished, heexhibited from under his clothes a small round mirror of steel of extraordinary brilliancy, and placing itbefore my eyes asked me to look into it. I had not only heard before of these mirrors, which are frequently used in the temples, but I had often seenthem. It is claimed that under the direction and will of instructed priests, there appear in them the Daij−Dzin,the great spirits who notify the enquiring devotees of their fate. I first imagined that his intention was toevoke such a spirit, who would answer my queries. What happened, however, was something of quite adifferent character. No sooner had I, not without a last pang of mental squeamishness, produced by a deep sense of my ownabsurd position, touched the mirror, than I suddenly felt a strange sensation in the arm of the hand that held it.For a brief moment I forgot to \"sit in the seat of the scorner\" and failed to look at the matter from a ludicrouspoint of view. Was it fear that suddenly clutched my brain, for an instant paralyzing its activity −− . . . that fear when the heart longs to know, what it is death to hear? No; for I still had consciousness enough left to go on persuading myself that nothing would come out of anexperiment, in the nature of which no sane man could ever believe. What was it then, that crept across mybrain like a living thing of ice, producing therein a sensation of horror, and then clutched at my heart as if adeadly serpent had fastened its fangs into it? With a convulsive jerk of the hand I dropped the −− I blush towrite the adjective −− \"magic\" mirror, and could not force myself to pick it up from the settee on which I wasreclining. For one short moment there was a terrible struggle between some undefined, and to me utterlyinexplicable, longing to look into the depths of the polished surface of the mirror and my pride, the ferocity ofwhich nothing seemed capable of taming. It was finally so tamed, however, its revolt being conquered by itsown defiant intensity. There was an opened novel lying on a lacquer table near the settee, and as my eyeshappened to fall upon its pages, I read the words, \"The veil which covers futurity is woven by the hand ofmercy.\" This was enough. That same pride which had hitherto held me back from what I regarded as adegrading, superstitious experiment, caused me to challenge my fate. I picked up the ominously shining diskand prepared to look into it. While I was examining the mirror, the Yamabooshi hastily spoke a few words to the Bonze, Tamoora, atwhich I threw a furtive and suspicious glance at both. I was wrong once more. \"The holy man desires me to put you a question and give you at the same time a warning,\" remarked theBonze. \"If you are willing to see for yourself now, you will have −− under the penalty of seeing for ever, inthe hereafter, all that is taking place, at whatever distance, and that against your will or inclination −− tosubmit to a regular course of purification, after you have learnt what you want through the mirror.\" Nightmare TalesIII −− PSYCHIC MAGIC34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"\"What is this course, and what have I to promise?\" I asked defiantly. \"It is for your own good. You must promise him to submit to the process, lest, for the rest of his life, heshould have to hold himself responsible, before his own conscience, for having made an irresponsible seer ofyou. Will you do so, friend?\" \"There will be time enough to think of it, if I see anything\" −− I sneeringly replied, adding under my breath−− \"something I doubt a good deal, so far.\" \"Well you are warned, friend. The consequences will now remain with yourself,\" was the solemn answer. I glanced at the clock, and made a gesture of impatience, which was remarked and understood by theYamabooshi. It was just seven minutes after five.\"Define well in your mind what you would see and learn,\" said the \"conjuror,\" placing the mirror and paperin my hands, and instructing me how to use them. His instructions were received by me with more impatience than gratitude; and for one short instant, Ihesitated again. Nevertheless, I replied, while fixing the mirror. \"I desire but one thing −− to learn the reason or reasons why my sister has so suddenly ceased writing tome.\". . . Had I pronounced these words in reality, and in the hearing of the two witnesses, or had I only thought them?To this day I cannot decide the point. I now remember but one thing distinctly: while I sat gazing in themirror, the Yamabooshi kept gazing at me. But whether this process lasted half a second or three hours, Ihave never since been able to settle in my mind with any degree of satisfaction. I can recall every detail of thescene up to that moment when I took up the mirror with the left hand, holding the paper inscribed with themystic characters between the thumb and finger of the right, when all of a sudden I seemed to quite loseconsciousness of the surrounding objects. The passage from the active waking state to one that I couldcompare with nothing I had ever experienced before, was so rapid, that while my eyes had ceased to perceiveexternal objects and had completely lost sight of the Bonze, the Yamabooshi, and even of my room, I couldnevertheless distinctly see the whole of my head and my back, as I sat leaning forward with the mirror in myhand. Then came a strong sensation or an involuntary rush forward, of snapping off, so to say, from my place−− I had almost said from my body. And, then, while every one of my other senses had become totallyparalyzed, my eyes, as I thought, unexpectedly caught a clearer and far more vivid glimpse than they had everhad in reality, of my sister's new house at Nuremberg, which I had never visited and knew only from asketch, and other scenery with which I had never been very familiar. Together with this, and while feeling inmy brain what seemed like flashes of a departing consciousness −− dying persons must feel so, no doubt −−the very last, vague thought, so weak as to have been hardly perceptible, was that I must look very, veryridiculous . . . This feeling −− for such it was rather than a thought −− was interrupted, suddenlyextinguished, so to say, by a clear mental vision (I cannot characterize it otherwise) of myself, of that which Iregarded as, and knew to be my body, lying with ashy cheeks on a settee, dead to all intents and purposes, butstill staring with the cold and glassy eyes of a corpse into the mirror. Bending over it, with his two emaciatedhands cutting the air in every direction over its white face, stood the tall figure of the Yamabooshi, for whomI felt at that instant an inextinguishable, murderous hatred. As I was going, in thought, to pounce upon thevile charlatan, my corpse, the two old men, the room itself, and every object in it, trembled and danced in areddish glowing light, and seemed to float rapidly away from \"me.\" A few more grotesque, distorted shadowsbefore \"my\" sight; and, with a last feeling of terror and a supreme effort to realize who then was I now,since I was not that corpse −− a great veil of darkness fell over me, like a funeral pall, and every thought inme was dead.

Forthere I was, vividly realizing that I was rapidly moving forward, while experiencing a queer, strangesensation as though I were swimming, without impulse or effort on my part, and in total darkness. The ideathat first presented itself to me was that of a long subterranean passage of water, of earth, and stifling air,though bodily I had no perception, no sensation, of the presence or contact of any of these. I tried to utter afew words, to repeat my last sentence, \"I desire but one thing: to learn the reason or reasons why my sisterhas so suddenly ceased writing to me\" −− but the only words I heard out of the twenty−one, were the two, \"tolearn,\" and these, instead of their coming out of my own larynx, came back to me in my own voice, butentirely outside myself, near, but not in me. In short, they were pronounced by my voice, not by my lips. . . . One more rapid, involuntary motion, one more plunge into the Cymmerian darkness of a (to me) unknownelement, and I saw myself standing −− actually standing underground, as it seemed. I was compactly andthickly surrounded on all sides, above and below, right and left, with earth, and in the mould, and yet itweighed not, and seemed quite immaterial and transparent to my senses. I did not realize for one second theutter absurdity, nay, impossibility of that seeming fact! One second more, one short instant, and I perceived−− oh, inexpressible horror, when I think of it now; for then, although I perceived, realized, and recordedfacts and events far more clearly than ever I had done before, I did not seem to be touched in any other wayby what I saw. Yes −− I perceived a coffin at my feet. It was a plain, unpretentious shell, made of deal, thelast couch of the pauper, in which, notwithstanding its closed lid, I plainly saw a hideous, grinning skull, aman's skeleton, mutilated and broken in many of its parts, as though it had been taken out of some hiddenchamber of the defunct Inquisition, where it had been subjected to torture. \"Who can it be?\" −− I thought. At this moment I heard again proceeding from afar the same voice −− my voice. . . . \"the reason or reasonswhy\" . . . . it said; as though these words were the unbroken continuation of the same sentence of which it hadjust repeated the two words \"to learn.\" It sounded near, and yet as from some incalculable distance; giving methen the idea that the long subterranean journey, the subsequent mental reflexions and discoveries, hadoccupied no time; had been performed during the short, almost instantaneous interval between the first andthe middle words of the sentence, begun, at any rate, if not actually pronounced by myself in my room atKioto, and which it was now finishing, in interrupted, broken phrases, like a faithful echo of my own wordsand voice. . . . Forthwith, the hideous, mangled remains began assuming a form, and, to me, but too familiar appearance.The broken parts joined together one to the other, the bones became covered once more with flesh, and Irecognized in these disfigured remains −− with some surprise, but not a trace of feeling at the sight −− mysister's dead husband, my own brother−in−law, whom I had for her sake loved so truly. \"How was it, and howdid he come to die such a terrible death?\" −− I asked myself. To put oneself a query seemed, in the state inwhich I was, to instantly solve it. Hardly had I asked myself the question, when as if in a panorama, I saw theretrospective picture of poor Karl's death, in all its horrid vividness, and with every thrilling detail, every oneof which, however, left me then entirely and brutally indifferent. Here he is, the dear old fellow, full of lifeand joy at the prospect of more lucrative employment from his principal, examining and trying in awood−sawing factory a monster steam engine just arrived from America. He bends over, to examine moreclosely an inner arrangement, to tighten a screw. His clothes are caught by the teeth of the revolving wheel infull motion, and suddenly he is dragged down, doubled up, and his limbs half severed, torn off, before theworkmen, unacquainted with the mechanism, can stop it. He is taken out, or what remains of him, dead,mangled, a thing of horror, an unrecognisable mass of palpitating flesh and blood! I follow the remains,wheeled as an unrecognizable heap to the hospital, hear the brutally given order that the messengers of deathshould stop on their way at the house of the widow and orphans. I follow them, and find the unconsciousfamily quietly assembled together.

My heart, my feelings, even my personality, seem to havedisappeared, to have been left behind, to belong to somebody else. There \"I\" stand, and witness her unprepared reception of the ghastly news. I realize clearly, without onemoment's hesitation or mistake, the effect of the shock upon her, I perceive clearly, following and recording,to the minutest detail, her sensations and the inner process that takes place in her. I watch and remember,missing not one single point. As the corpse is brought into the house for identification I hear the long agonizing cry, my own namepronounced, and the dull thud of the living body falling upon the remains of the dead one. I followed withcuriosity the sudden thrill and the instantaneous perturbation in her brain that follow it, and watch withattention the worm−like, precipitate, and immensely intensified motion of the tubular fibres, theinstantaneous change of colour in the cephalic extremity of the nervous system, the fibrous nervous matterpassing from white to bright red and then to a dark red, bluish hue. I notice the sudden flash of aphosphorous−like, brilliant Radiance, its tremor and its sudden extinction followed by darkness −− completedarkness in the region of memory −− as the Radiance, comparable in its form only to a human shape, oozesout suddenly from the top of the head, expands, loses its form and scatters. And I say to myself: \"This isinsanity; life−long, incurable insanity, for the principle of intelligence is not paralyzed or extinguishedtemporarily, but has just deserted the tabernacle for ever, ejected from it by the terrible force of the suddenblow . . . .

Suddenly I hear again my far−off yet near voice pronouncing emphatically and close by me the words. . . .\"why my sister has so suddenly ceased writing\". . . . And before the two final words \"to me\" have completedthe sentence, I see a long series of sad events, immediately following the catastrophe. I behold the mother, now a helpless, grovelling idiot, in the lunatic asylum attached to the city hospital, theseven younger children admitted into a refuge for paupers. Finally I see the two elder, a boy of fifteen and agirl a year younger, my favourites, both taken by strangers into their service. A captain of a sailing vesselcarries away my nephew, an old Jewess adopts the tender girl. I see the events with all their horrors andthrilling details, and record each, to the smallest detail, with the utmost coolness. For, mark well: when I use such expressions as horrors \" etc., they are to be understood as an afterthought.During the whole time of the events described I experienced no sensation of either pain or pity. My feelingsseemed to be paralyzed as well as my external senses; it was only after \"coming back\" that I realized myirretrievable losses to their full extent. Much of that which I had so vehemently denied in those days, owing to sad personal experience I have toadmit now. Had I been told by any one at that time, that man could act and think and feel, irrespective of hisbrain and senses; nay, that by some mysterious, and to this day, for me, incomprehensible power, he could betransported mentally, thousands of miles away from his body, there to witness not only present but also pastevents, and remember these by storing them in his memory −− I would have proclaimed that man as amadman. Alas, I can do so no longer, for I have become myself that \"madman.\" Ten, twenty, forty, a hundredtimes during the course of this wretched life of mine, have I experienced and lived over such moments ofexistence, outside of my body. Accursed be that hour when this terrible power was first awakened in me! Ihave not even the consolation left of attributing such glimpses of events at a distance to insanity. Madmenrave and see that which exists not in the realm they belong to. My visions have proved invariablycorrect. But to my narrative of woe. I had hardly had time to see my unfortunate young niece in her new Israelitish home, when I felt a shock ofthe same nature as the one that had sent me \"swimming\" through the bowels of the earth, as I had thought. I Nightmare TalesIV −− A VISION OF HORROR37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"opened my eyes in my own room, and the first thing I fixed upon, by accident, was the clock. The hands ofthe dial showed seven minutes and a half past five!. . . . I had thus passed through these most terribleexperiences which it takes me hours to narrate, in precisely half a minute of time!But this, too, was an afterthought. For one brief instant I recollected nothing of what I had seen. The intervalbetween the time I had glanced at the clock when taking the mirror from the Yamabooshi's hand and thissecond glance, seemed to me merged in one. I was just opening my lips to hurry on the Yamabooshi with hisexperiment, when the full remembrance of what I had just seen flashed lightning −− like into my brain.Uttering a cry of horror and despair, I felt as though the whole creation were crushing me under its weight.For one moment I remained speechless, the picture of human ruin amid a world of death and desolation. Myheart sank down in anguish: my doom was closed; and a hopeless gloom seemed to settle over the rest of mylife for ever. V −− RETURN OF DOUBTSThen came a reaction as sudden as my grief itself. A doubt arose in my mind, which forthwith grew into afierce desire of denying the truth of what I had seen. A stubborn resolution of treating the whole thing as anempty, meaningless dream, the effect of my overstrained mind, took possession of me. Yes; it was but a lyingvision, an idiotic cheating of my own senses, suggesting pictures of death and misery which had been evokedby weeks of incertitude and mental depression. \"How could I see all that I have seen in less than half a minute?\" −− I exclaimed. \"The theory of dreams, therapidity with which the material changes on which our ideas in vision depend, are excited in thehemispherical ganglia, is sufficient to account for the long series of events I have seemed to experience. Indream alone can the relations of space and time be so completely annihilated. The Yamabooshi is for nothingin this disagreeable nightmare. He is only reaping that which has been sown by myself, and, by using someinfernal drug, of which his tribe have the secret, he has contrived to make me lose consciousness for a fewseconds and see that vision −− as lying as it is horrid. Avaunt all such thoughts, I believe them not. In a fewdays there will be a steamer sailing for Europe . . . . I shall leave to−morrow! This disjointed monologue was pronounced by me aloud, regardless of the presence of my respected friendthe Bonze, Tamoora, and the Yamabooshi. The latter was standing before me in the same position as when heplaced the mirror in my hands, and kept looking at me calmly, I should perhaps say looking through me, andin dignified silence. The Bonze, whose kind countenance was beaming with sympathy, approached me as hewould a sick child, and gently laying his hand on mine, and with tears in his eyes, said: \"Friend, you must notleave this city before you have been completely purified of your contact with the lower Daij−Dzins (spirits),who had to be used to guide your inexperienced soul to the places it craved to see. The entrance to your InnerSelf must be closed against their dangerous intrusion. Lose no time, therefore, my Son, and allow the holyMaster, yonder, to purify you at once.\" But nothing can be more deaf than anger once aroused. \"The sap of reason\" could no longer \"quench the fireof passion,\" and at that moment I was not fit to listen to his friendly voice. His is a face I can never recall tomy memory without genuine feeling; his, a name I will ever pronounce with a sigh of emotion; but at thatever memorable hour when my passions were inflamed to white heat, I felt almost a hatred for the kind, goodold man, I could not forgive him his interference in the present event. Hence, for all answer, therefore, hereceived from me a stern rebuke, a violent protest on my part against the idea that I could ever regard thevision I had had, in any other light save that of an empty dream, and his Yamabooshi as anything better thanan imposter. \"I will leave to−morrow, had I to forfeit my whole fortune as a penalty\" −− I exclaimed, palewith rage and despair. Nightmare TalesV −− RETURN OF DOUBTS38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"\"You will repent it the whole of your life, if you do so before the holy man has shut every entrance in youagainst intruders ever on the watch and ready to enter the open door,\" was the answer. \"The Daij−Dzins willhave the best of you.\" I interrupted him with a brutal laugh, and a still more brutally phrased enquiry about the fees I was expectedto give the Yamabooshi, for his experiment with me. \"He needs no reward,\" was the reply. \"The order he belongs to is the richest in the world, since its adherentsneed nothing, for they are above all terrestrial and venal desires. Insult him not, the good man who came tohelp you out of pure sympathy for your suffering, and to relieve you of mental agony.\" But I would listen to no words of reason and wisdom. The spirit of rebellion and pride had taken possessionof me, and made me disregard every feeling of personal friendship, or even of simple propriety. Luckily forme, on turning round to order the medican monk out of my presence, I found he had gone. I had not seen him move, and attributed his stealthy departure to fear at having been detected and understood. Fool! blind, conceited idiot that I was! Why did I fail to recognize the Yamabooshi's power, and that thepeace of my whole life was departing with him, from that moment for ever? But I did so fail. Even the felldemon of my long fears −− uncertainty −− was now entirely overpowered by that fiend scepticism −− thesilliest of all. A dull, morbid unbelief, a stubborn denial of the evidence of my own senses, and a determinedwill to regard the whole vision as a fancy of my overwrought mind, had taken firm hold of me. \"My mind,\" I argued, \"what is it? Shall I believe with the superstitious and the weak that this production ofphosphorus and grey matter is indeed the superior part of me; that it can act and see independently of myphysical senses? Never! As well believe in the planetary 'intelligences' of the astrologer, as in the'Daij−Dzins' of my credulous though well−meaning friend, the priest. As well confess one's belief in Jupiterand Sol, Saturn and Mercury, and that these worthies guide their spheres and concern themselves withmortals, as to give one serious thought to the airy nonentities supposed to have guided my 'soul' in itsunpleasant dream! I loathe and laugh at the absurd idea. I regard it as a personal insult to the intellect andrational reasoning powers of a man, to speak of invisible creatures, 'subjective intelligences,' and all that kindof insane superstition.\" In short, I begged my friend the Bonze to spare me his protests, and thus theunpleasantness of breaking with him for ever. Thus I raved and argued before the venerable Japanese gentleman, doing all in my power to leave on hismind the indelible conviction of my having gone suddenly mad. But his admirable forbearance proved morethan equal to my idiotic passion; and he implored me once more, for the sake of my whole future, to submitto certain \"necessary purificatory rites.\" \"Never! Far rather dwell in air, rarified to nothing by the air−pump or wholesome unbelief, than in the dimfog of silly superstition,\" I argued, paraphrazing Richter's remark. \"I will not believe,\" I repeated; \"but as Ican no longer bear such uncertainty about my sister and her family, I will return by the first steamer toEurope.\" This final determination upset my old acquaintance altogether. His earnest prayer not to depart before I hadseen the Yamabooshi once more, received no attention from me. \"Friend of a foreign land!\" −− he cried, \"I pray that you may not repent of your unbelief and rashness. Maythe 'Holy One' [Kwan−On, the Goddess of Mercy] protect you from the Dzins! For, since you refuse tosubmit to the process of purification at the hands of the holy Yamabooshi, he is powerless to defend you fromthe evil influences evoked by your unbelief and defiance of truth.

May I speak?\" \"Go on and have your say,\" was the ungracious assent. \"But let me warn you, in my turn, that nothing youcan say can make of me a believer in your disgraceful superstitions.\" This was added with a cruel feeling ofpleasure in bestowing one more needless insult. But the excellent man disregarded this new sneer as he had all others. Never shall I forget the solemnearnestness of his parting words, the pitying, remorseful look on his face when he found that it was, indeed,all to no purpose, that by his kindly meant interference he had only led me to my destruction. \"Lend me your ear, good sir, for the last time,\" he began, \"learn that unless the holy and venerable man; who,to relieve your distress, opened your 'soul vision,' is permitted to complete his work, your future life will,indeed, be little worth living. He has to safeguard you against involuntary repetitions of visions of the samecharacter. Unless you consent to it of your own free will, however, you will have to be left in the power ofForces which will harass and persecute you to the verge of insanity. Know that the development of 'LongVision' [clairvoyance] −− which is accomplished at will only by those for whom the Mother of Mercy, thegreat Kwan−On, has no secrets −− must, in the case of the beginner, be pursued with help of the air Dzins(elemental spirits) whose nature is soulless, and hence wicked. Know also that, while the Arihat, 'thedestroyer of the enemy,' who has subjected and made of these creatures his servants, has nothing to fear; hewho has no power over them becomes their slave. Nay, laugh not in your great pride and ignorance, but listenfurther. During the time of the vision and while the inner perceptions are directed toward the events theyseek, the Daij−Dzin has the seer −− when, like yourself, he is an inexperienced tyro −− entirely in its power;and for the time being that seer is no longer himself. He partakes of the nature of his 'guide.' The Dali−Dzin,which directs his inner sight, keeps his soul in durance vile, making of him, while the state lasts, a creaturelike itself. Bereft of his divine light, man is but a soulless being; hence during the time of such connection, hewill feel no human emotions, neither pity nor fear, love nor mercy.\" \"Hold!\" I involuntarily exclaimed, as the words vividly brought back to my recollections the indifferencewith which I had witnessed my sister's despair and sudden loss of reason in my \"hallucination,\" \"Hold! . . .But no; it is still worse madness in me to heed or find any sense in your ridiculous tale! But if you knew it tobe so dangerous why have advised the experiment at all?\" −− I added mockingly. \"It had to last but a few seconds, and no evil could have resulted from it, had you kept your promise to submitto purification,\" was the sad and humble reply. \"I wished you well, my friend, and my heart was nighbreaking to see you suffering day by day. The experiment is harmless enough when directed by one whoknows, and becomes dangerous only when the final precaution is neglected. It is the 'Master of Visions,' hewho has opened an entrance into your soul, who has to close it by using the Seal of Purification against anyfurther and deliberate ingress of. . . .\" \"The 'Master of Visions' forsooth!\" I cried, brutally interrupting him, \"say rather the Master of Imposture!\" The look of sorrow on his kind old face was so intense and painful to behold that I perceived I had gone toofar; but it was too late. \"Farewell, then!\" said the old Bonze, rising; and after performing the usual ceremonials of politeness,Tamoora left the house in dignified silence.

Evidently onthat last, and to me for ever memorable evening, he had been seriously offended with my more thanirreverent, my downright insulting remark about one whom he so justly respected. I felt sorry for him, but thewheel of passion and pride was too incessantly at work to permit me to feel a single moment of remorse.What was it that made me so relish the pleasure of wrath, that when, for one instant, I happened to lose sightof my supposed grievance toward the Yamabooshi, I forthwith lashed myself back into a kind of artificialfury against him. He had only accomplished what he had been expected to do, and what he had tacitlypromised; not only so, but it was I myself who had deprived him of the possibility of doing more, even formy own protection if I might believe the Bonze −− a man whom I knew to be thoroughly honourable andreliable. Was it regret at having been forced by my pride to refuse the proffered precaution, or was it the fearof remorse that made me rake together, in my heart, during those evil hours, the smallest details of thesupposed insult to that same suicidal pride? Remorse, as an old poet has aptly remarked, \"is like the heart inwhich it grows: . . . . \". . . if proud and gloomy, It is a poison−tree, that pierced to the utmost, Weeps only tears of blood\" . . . Perchance, it was the indefinite fear of something of that sort which caused me to remain so obdurate, and ledme to excuse, under the plea of terrible provocation, even the unprovoked insults that I had heaped upon thehead of my kind and all−forgiving friend, the priest. However, it was now too late in the day to recall thewords of offence I had uttered; and all I could do was to promise myself the satisfaction of writing him afriendly letter, as soon as I reached home. Fool, blind fool, elated with insolent self−conceit, that I was! Sosure did I feel, that my vision was due merely to some trick of the Yamabooshi, that I actually gloated overmy coming triumph in writing to the Bonze that I had been right in answering his sad words of parting withan incredulous smile, as my sister and family were all in good health −− happy! I had not been at sea for a week, before I had cause to remember his words of warning! From the day of my experience with the magic mirror, I perceived a great change in my whole state, and Iattributed it, at first, to the mental depression I had struggled against for so many months. During the day Ivery often found myself absent from the surroundings scenes, losing sight for several minutes of things andpersons. My nights were disturbed, my dreams oppressive, and at times horrible. Good sailor I certainly was;and besides, the weather was unusually fine, the ocean as smooth as a pond. Notwithstanding this, I often felta strange giddiness, and the familiar faces of my fellow−passengers assumed at such times the mostgrotesque appearances. Thus, a young German I used to know well was once suddenly transformed beforemy eyes into his old father, whom we had laid in the little burial place of the European colony some threeyears before. We were talking on deck of the defunct and of a certain business arrangement of his, when MaxGrunner's head appeared to me as though it were covered with a strange film. A thick greyish mistsurrounded him, and gradually condensing around and upon his healthy countenance, settled suddenly intothe grim old head I had myself seen covered with six feet of soil. On another occasion, as the captain wastalking of a Malay thief whom he had helped to secure and lodge in goal, I saw near him the yellow,villainous face of a man answering to his description. I kept silence about such hallucinations; but as theybecame more and more frequent, I felt very much disturbed, though still attributing them to natural causes,such as I had read about in medical books. One night I was abruptly awakened by a long and loud cry of distress. It was a woman's voice, plaintive likethat of a child, full of terror and of helpless despair. I awoke with a start to find myself on land, in a strange Nightmare TalesVI −− I DEPART −− BUT NOT ALONE41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"room. A young girl, almost a child, was desperately struggling against a powerful middle−aged man, who hadsurprised her in her own room, and during her sleep. Behind the closed and locked door, I saw listening anold woman, whose face, notwithstanding the fiendish expression upon it, seemed familiar to me, and Iimmediately recognized it: it was the face of the Jewess who had adopted my niece in the dream I had atKioto. She had received gold to pay for her share in the foul crime, and was now keeping her part of thecovenant . . . . But who was the victim? O horror unutterable! Unspeakable horror! When I realized thesituation after coming back to my normal state, I found it was my own child−niece. But, as in my first vision, I felt in me nothing of the nature of that despair born of affection that fills one'sheart, at the sight of a wrong done to, or a misfortune befalling, those one loves; nothing but a manlyindignation in the presence of suffering inflicted upon the weak and the helpless. I rushed, of course, to herrescue, and seized the wanton, brutal beast by the neck. I fastened upon him with powerful grasp, but, theman heeded it not, he seemed not even to feel my hand. The coward, seeing himself resisted by the girl, liftedhis powerful arm and the thick fist, coming down like a heavy hammer upon the sunny locks, felled the childto the ground. It was with a loud cry of the indignation of a stranger, not with that of a tigress defending hercub, that I sprang upon the lewd beast and sought to throttle him. I then remarked, for the first time, that, ashadow myself, I was grasping but another shadow! . . . . My loud shrieks and imprecations had awakened the whole steamer. They were attributed to a nightmare. Idid not seek to take anyone into my confidence; but, from that day forward, my life became a long series ofmental tortures, I could hardly shut my eyes without becoming witness of some horrible deed, some scene ofmisery, death or crime, whether past, present or even future −− as I ascertained later on. It was as thoughsome mocking fiend had taken upon himself the task of making me go through the vision of everything thatwas bestial, malignant and hopeless, in this world of misery. No radiant vision of beauty or virtue ever litwith the faintest ray these pictures of awe and wretchedness that I seemed doomed to witness. Scenes ofwickedness, of murder, of treachery and of lust fell dismally upon my sight, and I was brought face to facewith the vilest results of man's passions, the most terrible outcome of his material earthly cravings. Had the Bonze foreseen, indeed, the dreary results, when he spoke of Daij−Dzins to whom I left \"an ingress\"\"a door open\" in me? Nonsense! There must be some physiological, abnormal change in me. Once atNuremberg, when I have ascertained how false was the direction taken by my fears −− I dared not hope forno misfortune at all −− these meaningless visions will disappear as they came. The very fact that my fancyfollows but one direction, that of pictures of misery, of human passions in their worst, material shape, is aproof, to me, of their unreality. \"If, as you say, man consists of one substance, matter, the object of the physical senses; and if perceptionwith its modes is only the result of the organization of the brain, then should we be naturally attracted but tothe material, the earthly\" . . . I thought I heard the familiar voice of the Bonze interrupting my reflections, andrepeating an often used argument of his in his discussions with me. \"There are two planes of visions before men,\" I again heard him say, \"the plane of undying love and spiritualaspirations, the efflux from the eternal light; and the plane of restless, ever changing matter, the light in whichthe misguided Daij−Dzins bathe.\" VII −− ETERNITY IN A SHORT DREAMIn those days I could hardly bring myself to realize, even for a moment, the absurdity of a belief in any kindof spirits, whether good or bad. I now understood, if I did not believe, what was meant by the term, though Istill persisted in hoping that it would finally prove some physical derangement or nervous hallucination. Tofortify my unbelief the more, I tried to bring back to my memory all the arguments used against faith in such Nightmare TalesVII −− ETERNITY IN A SHORT DREAM42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"superstitions, that I had ever read or heard. I recalled the biting sarcasms of Voltaire, the calm reasoning ofHume, and I repeated to myself ad nauseam the words of Rousseau, who said that superstition, \"the disturberof Society,\" could never be too strongly attacked. \"Why should the sight, the phantasmagoria, rather\" −− Iargued −− \"of that which we know in a waking sense to be false, come to affect us at all?\" Why should −− \"Names, whose sense we see not Fray us with things that be not?\" One day the old captain was narrating to us the various superstitions to which sailors were addicted; apompous English missionary remarked that Fielding had declared long ago that \"superstition renders a man afool,\" −− after which he hesitated for an instant, and abruptly stopped. I had not taken any part in the generalconversation; but no sooner had the reverend speaker relieved himself of the quotation than I saw in that haloof vibrating light, which I now noticed almost constantly over every human head on the steamer, the words ofFielding's next proposition −− \"and scepticism makes him mad.\" I had heard and read of the claims of those who pretend to seership, that they often see the thoughts of peopletraced in the aura of those present. Whatever \"aura\" may mean with others, I had now a personal experienceof the truth of the claim, and felt sufficiently disgusted with the discovery! I −− a clairvoyant! a new horroradded to my life, an absurd and ridiculous gift developed, which I shall have to conceal from all, feelingashamed of it as if it were a case of leprosy. At this moment my hatred to the Yamabooshi, and even to myvenerable old friend, the Bonze, knew no bounds. The former had evidently by his manipulations over mewhile I was lying unconscious, touched some unknown physiological spring in my brain, and by loosing ithad called forth a faculty generally hidden in the human constitution; and it was the Japanese priest who hadintroduced the wretch into my house! But my anger and my curses were alike useless, and could be of no avail. Moreover, we were already inEuropean waters, and in a few more days we should be at Hamburg. Then would my doubts and fears be setat rest, and I should find, to my intense relief, that although clairvoyance, as regards the reading of humanthoughts on the spot, may have some truth in it, the discernment of such events at a distance, as I haddreamed of, was an impossibility for human faculties. Notwithstanding all my reasoning, however, my heartwas sick with fear, and full of the blackest presentiments; I felt that my doom was closing. I suffered terribly,my nervous and mental prostration becoming intensified day by day. The night before we entered port I had a dream. I fancied I was dead. My body lay cold and stiff in its last sleep, whilst its dying consciousness, which stillregarded itself as \"I,\" realizing the event, was preparing to meet in a few seconds its own extinction. It hadbeen always my belief that as the brain preserved heat longer than any of the other organs, and was the last tocease its activity, the thought in it survived bodily death by several minutes. Therefore, I was not in the leastsurprised to find in my dream that while the frame had already crossed that awful gulf \"no mortal e'erre−passed,\" its consciousness was still in the gray twilight, the first shadows of the great Mystery. Thus myTHOUGHT wrapped, as I believed, in the remnants, of its now fast retiring vitality, was watching withintense and eager curiosity the approaches of its own dissolution, i.e., of its annihilation. \"I\" was hastening torecord my last impressions, lest the dark mantle of eternal oblivion should envelope me, before I had time tofeel and enjoy, the great, the supreme triumph of learning that my life−long convictions were true, that deathis a complete and absolute cessation of conscious being. Everything around me was getting darker with everymoment. Huge grey shadows were moving before my vision, slowly at first, then with accelerated motion,until they commenced whirling around with an almost vertiginous rapidity. Then, as though that motion hadtaken place for the purposes of brewing darkness, the object once reached, it slackened its speed, and thedarkness became gradually transformed into intense blackness, it ceased altogether. There was nothing now Nightmare TalesVII −− ETERNITY IN A SHORT DREAM43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"within my immediate perceptions, but that fathomless black Space, as dark as pitch; to me it appeared aslimitless and as silent as the shoreless Ocean of Eternity upon which Time, the progeny of man's brain, is forever gliding, but which it can never cross. Dream is defined by Cato as \"but the image of our hopes and fears.\" Having never feared death when awake,I felt, in this dream of mine, calm and serene at the idea of my speedy end. In truth, I felt rather relieved at thethought −− probably owing to my recent mental suffering −− that the end of all, of doubt, of fear for those Iloved, of suffering, and of every anxiety, was close at hand. The constant anguish that had been gnawingceaselessly at my heavy, aching heart for many a long and weary month, had now become unbearable; and ifas Seneca thinks, death is but \"the ceasing to be what we were before,\" it was better that I should die. Thebody is dead; \"I,\" its consciousness −− that which is all that remains of me now, for a few moments longer −−am preparing to follow. Mental perceptions will get weaker, more dim and hazy with every second of time,until the longed for oblivion envelopes me completely in its cold shroud. Sweet is the magic hand of Death,the great World−Comforter; profound and dreamless is sleep in its unyielding arms. Yea, verily, it is awelcome guest. . . . A calm and peaceful haven amidst the roaring billows of the Ocean of life, whosebreakers lash in vain the rock−bound shores of Death. Happy the lonely bark that drifts into the still waters ofits black gulf, after having been so long, so cruelly tossed about by the angry waves of sentient life. Mooredin it for evermore, needing no longer either sail or rudder, my bark will now find rest. Welcome then, ODeath, at this tempting price; and fare thee well, poor body, which, having neither sought it nor derivedpleasure from it, I now readily give up! While uttering this death−chant to the prostrate form before me, I bent over, and examined it with curiosity. Ifelt the surrounding darkness oppressing me, weighing on me almost tangibly, and I fancied I found in it theapproach of the Liberator I was welcoming. And yet how very strange! If real, final Death takes place in ourconsciousness; if after the bodily death, \"I\" and my conscious perceptions are one −− how is it that theseperceptions do not become weaker, why does my brain −action seem as vigorous as ever now . . . . that I amde facto dead? . . . . Nor does the usual feeling of anxiety, the \"heavy heart\" so−called, decrease in intensity;nay, it even seems to become worse . . . . unspeakably so! . . . . How long it takes for full oblivion to arrive! . .. Ah, here's my body again! . . . Vanished out of sight for a second or two, it reappears before me once more .. . . How white and ghastly it looks! Yet . . . . its brain cannot be quite dead, since \"I,\" its consciousness, amstill acting, since we two fancy that we still are, that we live and think, disconnected from our creator and itsideating cells. Suddenly I felt a strong desire to see how much longer the progress of dissolution was likely to last, before itplaced its last seal on the brain and rendered it inactive. I examined my brain in its cranial cavity, through the(to me) entirely transparent walls and roof of the skull, and even touched the brain−matter . . . . How or withwhose hands, I am now unable to say; but the impression of the slimy, intensely cold matter produced a verystrong impression on me, in that dream. To my great dismay, I found that the blood having entirely congealedand the brain−tissues having themselves undergone a change that would no longer permit any molecularaction, it became impossible for me to account for the phenomena now taking place with myself. Here was I,−− or my consciousness which is all one −− standing apparently entirely disconnected from my brain whichcould no longer function . . . . But I had no time left for reflection. A new and most extraordinary change inmy perceptions had taken place and now engrossed my whole attention . . . . What does this signify? . . . . The same darkness was around me as before, a black, impenetrable space, extending in every direction. Onlynow, right before me, in whatever direction I was looking, moving with me which way soever I moved, therewas a gigantic round clock; a disc, whose large white face shone ominously on the ebony−black background.As I looked at its huge dial, and at the pendulum moving to and fro regularly and slowly in Space, as if itsswinging meant to divide eternity, I saw its needles pointing to seven minutes past five. \"The hour at whichmy torture had commenced at Kioto!\" I had barely found time to think of the coincidence, when to myunutterable horror, I felt myself going through the same, the identical, process that I had been made to Nightmare TalesVII −− ETERNITY IN A SHORT DREAM44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"experience on that memorable and fatal day. I swam underground, dashing swiftly through the earth; I foundmyself once more in the pauper's grave and recognized my brother−in−law in the mangled remains; Iwitnessed his terrible death; entered my sister's house; followed her agony, and saw her go mad. I went overthe same scenes without missing a single detail of them. But, alas! I was no longer iron−bound in the calmindifference that had then been mine, and which in that first vision had left me as unfeeling to my greatmisfortune as if I had been a heartless thing of rock. My mental tortures were now becoming beyonddescription and well−nigh unbearable. Even the settled despair, the never−ceasing anxiety I was constantlyexperiencing when awake, had become now, in my dream and in the face of this repetition of vision andevents, as an hour of darkened sunlight compared to a deadly cyclone. Oh! how I suffered in this wealth andpomp of infernal horrors, to which the conviction of the survival of man's consciousness after death −− for inthat dream I firmly believed that my body was dead −− added the most terrifying of all! The relative relief I felt, when, after going over the last scene, I saw once more the great white face of the dialbefore me was not of long duration. The long, arrow−shaped needle was pointing on the colossal disk at −−seven minutes and a half−past five o'clock. But, before I had time to well realize the change, the needlemoved slowly backwards, stopped at precisely the seventh minute, and −− O cursed fate! . . . . I found myselfdriven into a repetition of the same series over again! Once more I swam underground, and saw, and heard,and suffered every torture that hell can provide; I passed through every mental anguish known to man orfiend. I returned to see the fatal dial and its needle −− after what appeared to me an eternity −− moved, asbefore, only half a minute forward. I beheld it, with renewed terror, moving back again, and felt myselfpropelled forward anew. And so it went on, and on, and on, time after time, in what seemed to me an endlesssuccession, a series which never had any beginning, nor would it ever have an end . . . . Worst of all; my consciousness, my \"I,\" had apparently acquired the phenomenal capacity of trebling,quadruping, and even of decuplating itself. I lived, felt and suffered, in the same space of time, inhalf−a−dozen different places at once, passing over various events of my life, at different epochs and underthe most dissimilar circumstances; though predominant over all was my spiritual experience at Kioto. Thusas in the famous fugue in Don Giovanni, the heart−rending notes of Elvira's aria of despair ring high above,but interfere in no way with the melody of the minuet, the song of seduction, and the chorus, so I went overand over my travailed woes, the feelings of agony unspeakable at the awful sights of my vision, the repetitionof which blunted in no wise even a single pang of my despair and horror; nor did these feelings weaken in theleast scenes and events entirely disconnected with the first one, that I was living through again, or interfere inany way the one with the other. It was a maddening experience! A series of contrapuntal, mentalphantasmagoria from real life. Here was I, during the same half−a−minute of time, examining with coldcuriosity the mangled remains of my sister's husband; following with the same indifference the effects of thenews on her brain, as in my first Kioto vision, and feeling at the same time hell−torture for these very events,as when I returned to consciousness. I was listening to the philosophical discourses of the Bonze, every wordof which I heard and understood, and was trying to laugh him to scorn. I was again a child, then a youth,hearing my mother's and my sweet sister's voices, admonishing me and teaching duty to all men. I was savinga friend from drowning, and was sneering at his aged father who thanks me for saving a \"soul\" yetunprepared to meet his Maker. \"Speak of dual consciousness, you psycho−physiologists!\" −− I cried, in one of the moments when agony,mental and as it seemed to me physical also, had arrived at a degree of intensity which would have killed adozen living men; \"speak of your psychological and physiological experiments, you schoolmen, puffed upwith pride and book−learning! Here am I to give you the lie. . . .\" And now I was reading the works andholding converse with learned professors and lecturers, who had led me to my fatal scepticism. And, whilearguing the impossibility of consciousness divorced from its brain, I was shedding tears of blood over thesupposed fate of my nieces and nephews. More terrible than all: I knew, as only a liberated consciousnesscan know, that all I had seen in my vision at Japan, and all that I was seeing and hearing over and over againnow, was true in every point and detail, that it was a long string of ghastly and terrible, still of real, actual, Nightmare TalesVII −− ETERNITY IN A SHORT DREAM45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"facts. For, perhaps, the hundredth time, I had rivetted my attention on the needle of the clock, I had lost the numberof my gyrations and was fast coming to the conclusion that they would never stop, that consciousness is, afterall, indestructible, and that this was to be my punishment in Eternity. I was beginning to realize from personalexperience how the condemned sinners would feel −− \"were not eternal damnation a logical andmathematical impossibility in an ever−progressing Universe\" −− I still found the force to argue. Yea indeed;at this hour of my ever−increasing agony, my consciousness −− now my synonym for \"I\" −− had still thepower of revolting at certain theological claims, of denying all their propositions, all −− save ITSELF . . . .No; I denied the independent nature of my consciousness no longer, for I knew it now to be such. But isit eternal withal? O thou incomprehensible and terrible Reality! But if thou art eternal, who then art thou? −−since there is no diety, no God. Whence dost thou come, and when didst thou first appear, if thou art not apart of the cold body lying yonder? And whither dost thou lead me, who am thyself, and shall our thoughtand fancy have an end? What is thy real name, thou unfathomable REALITY, and impenetrable MYSTERY!Oh, I would fain annihilate thee . . . . \"Soul −− Vision\"! −− who speaks of Soul, and whose voice is this? . . . .It says that I see now for myself, that there is a Soul in man, after all. . . . I deny this. My Soul, my vital Soul,or the Spirit of life, has expired with my body, with the gray matter of my brain, This \"I \" of mine, thisconsciousness, is not yet proven to me as eternal. Reincarnation, in which the Bonze felt so anxious I shouldbelieve, may be true . . . . Why not? Is not the flower born year after year from the same root? Hence this \"I\"once separated from, its brain, losing its balance and calling forth such a host of visions . . . . beforereincarnating. I was again face to face with the inexorable, fatal clock. And as I was watching its needle, I heard the voice ofthe Bonze, coming out of the depths of its white face, saying: \"In this case, I fear you would have only toopen and to shut the temple door, over and over again, during a period which, however short, would seem toyou an eternity\" . . . . The clock had vanished, darkness made room for light, the voice of my old friend was drowned by amultitude of voices overhead on deck; and I awoke in my berth, covered with a cold perspiration, and faintwith terror. VIII −− A TALE OF WOEWe were at Hamburg, and no sooner had I seen my partners, who could hardly recognise me, than with theirconsent and good wishes I started for Nuremberg. Half−an−hour after my arrival, the last doubt with regard to the correctness of my vision had disappeared.The reality was worse than any expectations could have made it, and I was henceforward doomed to the mostdesolate life. I ascertained that I had seen the terrible tragedy, with all its heartrending details. Mybrother−in−law, killed under the wheels of a machine; my sister, insane, and now rapidly sinking toward herend; my niece −− the sweet flower of nature's fairest work −− dishonoured, in a den of infamy; the littlechildren dead of a contagious disease in an orphanage; my last surviving nephew at sea, no one knew where.A whole house, a home of love and peace, scattered; and I, left alone, a witness of this world of death, ofdesolation and dishonour. The news filled me with infinite despair, and I sank helpless before the wholesale,dire disaster, which rose before me all at once. The shock proved too much, and I fainted. The last thing Iheard before entirely losing my consciousness was a remark of the Burgmeister: \"Had you, before leavingKioto, telegraphed to the city authorities of your whereabouts, and of your intention of coming home to takecharge of your young relatives, we might have placed them elsewhere, and thus have saved them from theirfate. No one knew that the children had a well−to−do relative. They were left paupers and had to be dealtwith as such. They were comparatively strangers in Nuremberg, and under the unfortunate circumstances you Nightmare TalesVIII −− A TALE OF WOE46"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"could have hardly expected anything else . . . . I can only express my sincere sorrow.\" It was this terrible knowledge that I might, at any rate, have saved my young niece from her unmerited fate,but that through my neglect I had not done so, that was killing me. Had I but followed the friendly advice ofthe Bonze, Tamoora, and telegraphed to the authorities some weeks previous to my return much might havebeen avoided. It was all this, coupled with the fact that I could no longer doubt clairvoyance andclairaudience −− the possibility of which I had so long denied −− that brought me so heavily down upon myknees. I could avoid the censure of my fellow−creatures but I could never escape the stings of my conscience,the reproaches of my own aching heart −− no, not as long as I lived! I cursed my stubborn scepticism, mydenial of facts, my early education, I cursed myself and the whole world. . . . . For several days I contrived not to sink beneath my load, for I had a duty to perform to, the dead and to theliving. But my sister once rescued from the pauper's asylum, placed under the care of the best physicians,with her daughter to attend to her last moments, and the Jewess, whom I had brought to confess her crime,safely lodged in goal −− my fortitude and strength suddenly abandoned me. Hardly a week after my arrival Iwas myself no better than a raving maniac, helpless in the strong grip of a brain fever. For several weeks I laybetween life and death, the terrible disease defying the skill of the best physicians. At last my strongconstitution prevailed, and −− to my lifelong sorrow −− they proclaimed me saved. I heard the news with a bleeding heart. Doomed to drag the loathsome burden of life henceforth alone, and inconstant remorse; hoping for no help or remedy on earth, and still refusing to believe in the possibility ofanything better than a short survival of consciousness beyond the grave, this unexpected return to life addedonly one more drop of gall to my bitter feelings. They were hardly soothed by the immediate return, duringthe first days of my convalescence, of those unwelcome and unsought for visions, whose correctness andreality I could deny no more. Alas the day! they were no longer in my sceptical, blind mind. \"The children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain Fantasy\"; but always the faithful photographs of the real woes and sufferings of my fellow creatures, of my best friends.. . . Thus I found myself doomed, whenever I was left for a moment alone, to the helpless torture of a chainedPrometheus. During the still hours of night, as though held by some pitiless iron hand, I found myself led tomy sister's bedside, forced to watch there hour after hour, and see the silent disintegration of her wastedorganism; to witness and feel the sufferings that her own tenantless brain could no longer reflect or convey toher perceptions. But there was something still more horrible to barb the dart that could never be extricated. Ihad to look, by day, at the childish innocent face of my young niece, so sublimely simple and guileless in herpollution; and to witness, by night, how the full knowledge and recollection of her dishonour, of her younglife now for ever blasted, came to her in her dreams, as soon as she was asleep. The dreams took an objectiveform to me, as they had done on the steamer; I had to live them over again, night after night, and feel thesame terrible despair. For now, since I believed in the reality of seership, and had come to the conclusion thatin our bodies lies hidden, as in the caterpillar, the chrysalis which may contain in its turn the butterfly −− thesymbol of the soul −− I no longer remained indifferent, as of yore, to what I witnessed in my Soul−life.Something had suddenly developed in me, had broken loose from its icy cocoon. Evidently I no longer sawonly in consequence of the identification of my inner nature with a Daij−Dzin; my visions arose in,consequence of a direct personal psychic development, the fiendish creatures only taking care that I shouldsee nothing of an agreeable or elevating nature. Thus, now, not an unconscious pang in my dying sister'semaciated body, not a thrill of horror in my niece's restless sleep at the recollection of the crime perpetratedupon her, an innocent child, but found a responsive echo in my bleeding heart. The deep fountain ofsympathetic love and sorrow had gushed out from the physical heart, and was now loudly echoed by theawakened soul separated from the body. Thus had I to drain the cup of misery to the very dregs! Woe is me, Nightmare TalesVIII −− A TALE OF WOE47"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"it was a daily and nightly torture! Oh, how I mourned over my proud folly; how I was punished for havingneglected to avail myself at Moto of the proffered purification, for now I had come to believe even in theefficacy of the latter. The Daij−Dzin had indeed obtained control over me; and the fiend had let loose all thedogs of hell upon his victim. . . . . At last the awful gulf was reached and crossed. The poor insane martyr dropped into her dark, and nowwelcome grave, leaving behind her, but for a few short months, her young, her first−born, daughter.Consumption made short work of that tender girlish frame. Hardly a year after my arrival, I was left alone inthe whole wide world, my only surviving nephew having expressed a desire to follow his sea−faring career. And now, the sequel of my sad story is soon told. A wreck, a prematurely old man, looking at thirty asthough sixty winters had passed over my doomed head, and owing to the never−ceasing visions, myself dailyon the verge of insanity, I suddenly formed a desperate resolution. I would return to Kioto and seek out theYamabooshi. I would prostrate myself at the feet of the holy man, and would not leave him until he hadrecalled the Frankenstein he had raised, the Frankenstein with whom at the time, it was I, myself, who would,not part, through my insolent pride and unbelief. Three months later I was in my Japanese home again, and I at−once sought out my old, venerable Bonze,Tamoora Hideyeri, I now implored him to take me without an hour's delay to the Yamabooshi, the innocentcause of my daily tortures. His answer but placed the last, the supreme seal on my doom and tenfoldintensified my despair. The Yamabooshi had left the country for lands unknown! He had departed one finemorning into the interior, on a pilgrimage, and according to custom, would be absent, unless natural deathshortened the period, for no less than seven years! . . . . In this mischance, I applied for help and protection to other learned Yamabooshis; and though well awarehow useless it was in my case to seek efficient cure from any other \"adept,\" my excellent old friend dideverything he could to help me in my misfortune. But it was to no purpose, and the canker−worm of my life'sdespair could not be thoroughly extricated. I found from them that not one of these learned men couldpromise to relieve me entirely from the demon of clairvoyant obsession. It was he who raised certainDaij−Dzins, calling on them to show futurity, or things that had already come to pass, who alone had fullcontrol over them. With kind sympathy, which I had now learned to appreciate, the holy men invited me tojoin the group of their disciples, and learn from them what I could do for myself. \"Will alone, faith in yourown soul−powers, can help you now,\" they said. \"But it may take several years to undo even a part of thegreat mischief,\" they added. \"A Daij−Dzin is easily dislodged in the beginning; if left alone, he takespossession of a man's nature and it becomes almost impossible to uproot the fiend without killing his victim.\" Persuaded that there was nothing but this left for me to do, I gratefully assented, doing my best to believe inall that these holy men believed in, and yet ever failing to do so in my heart. The demon of unbelief andall−denial seemed rooted in me more firmly ever than the Daij−Dzin. Still I did all I could do, decided as Iwas not to lose my last chance of salvation. Therefore, I proceeded without delay to, free myself from theworld and my commercial obligations, in order to live for several years an independent life. I settled myaccounts with my Hamburg partners and severed my connection with the firm. Notwithstanding considerablefinancial losses resulting from such a precipitate liquidation, I found myself, after closing the accounts, a farricher man than I had thought I was. But wealth had no longer any attraction for me, now that I had no one toshare it with, no one to work for. Life had become a burden; and such was my indifference to my future, thatwhile giving away all my fortune to my nephew −− in case he should return alive from his sea voyager −−should have neglected entirely even a small provision for myself, had not my native partner interfered andinsisted upon my making it. I now recognized, with Lao−tze, that Knowledge was the only firm hold for aman to trust to, as it is the only one that cannot be shaken by any tempest. Wealth is a weak anchor in thedays of sorrow, and self−conceit the most fatal counsellor. Hence I followed the advice of my friends, andlaid aside for myself a modest sum, which would be sufficient to assure me a small income for life, or if I Nightmare TalesVIII −− A TALE OF WOE48"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ever left my new friends and instructors. Having settled my earthly accounts and disposed of my belongingsat Kioto, I joined the \"Masters of the Long Vision,\" who took me to their mysterious abode. There I remainedfor several years, studying very earnestly and in the most complete solitude, seeing no one but a few of themembers of our religious community. Many are the mysteries of nature that I have fathomed since then, and many secret folio from the library ofTzionene have I devoured, obtaining thereby mastery over several kinds of invisible beings of a lower order.But the great secret of power over the terrible Daij−Dzin I could not get. It remains in the possession of avery limited number of the highest Initiates of Lao−tze, the great majority of the Yamabooshis themselvesbeing ignorant how to obtain such mastery over the dangerous Elemental. One who would reach such powerof control would have to become entirely identified with the Yamabooshis, to accept their views and beliefs,and to attain the highest degree of Initiation. Very naturally, I was found unfit to join the Fraternity, owing tomany insurmountable reasons besides my congenital and ineradicable scepticism, though I tried hard tobelieve. Thus, partially relieved of my affliction and taught how to conjure the unwelcome visions away, Istill remained, and do remain to this day, helpless to prevent their forced appearance before me now and then. It was after assuring myself of my unfitness for the exalted position of an independent Seer and Adept that Ireluctantly gave up any further trial. Nothing had been heard of the holy man, the first innocent cause of mymisfortune; and the old Bonze himself, who occasionally visited me in my retreat, either could not, or wouldnot, inform me of the whereabouts of the Yamabooshi. When, therefore, I had to give up all hope of his everrelieving me entirely from my fatal gift, I resolved to return to Europe, to settle in solitude for the rest of mylife. With this object in view, I purchased through my late partners the Swiss chalet in which my haplesssister and I were born, where I had grown up under her care, and selected it for my future hermitage. When bidding me farewell for ever on the steamer which took me back to my fatherland, the good old Bonzetried to console me for my disappointments. \"My son,\" he said, \"regard all that happened to you as yourKarma −− a just retribution. No one who had subjected himself willingly to the power of a Daij−Dzin canever hope to become a Rahat (an Adept), a high−souled Yamabooshi −− unless immediately purified. At best,as in your case, he may become fitted to oppose and to successfully fight off the fiend. Like a scar left after apoisonous wound the race of a Daij−Dzin can never be effaced from the Soul until purified by a new rebirthWithal, feel not dejected, but be of good cheer in your affliction, since it has led you to acquire trueknowledge, and to accept many a truth you would have otherwise rejected with contempt. And of thispriceless knowledge, acquired through suffering and personal efforts −− no Daij−Dzin can ever deprive you.Fare thee well, then, and may the Mother of Mercy, the great Queen of Heaven, afford you comfort andprotection.\" We parted, and since then I have led the life of an anchorite, in constant solitude and study. Though stilloccasionally afflicted, I do not regret the years I have passed under the instruction of the Yamabooshis, butfeel gratified for the knowledge received. Of the priest Tamoora Hideyeri I think always with sincereaffection and respect. I corresponded regularly with him to the day of his death; an event which, with all its tome painful details, I had the unthanked−for privilege of witnessing across the seas, at the very hour in whichit occurred.THE LUMINOUS SHIELDWe were a small and select party of lighthearted travellers. We had arrived at Constantinople a week beforefrom Greece, and had devoted fourteen hours a day ever since to toiling up and down the steep heights ofPera, visiting bazaars, climbing to the tops of minarets and fighting our way through armies of hungry dogs,the traditional masters of the streets of Stamboul. Nomadic life is infectious, they say, and no civilization is Nightmare TalesTHE LUMINOUS SHIELD49"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"strong enough to destroy the charm of unrestrained freedom when it has once been tasted. The gipsy cannotbe tempted from his tent, and even the common tramp finds a fascination in his comfortless and precariousexistence, that prevents him taking to any fixed abode and occupation. To guard my spaniel Ralph fromfalling a victim to this infection, and joining the canine Bedouins that, infested the streets, was my chief careduring our stay in Constantinople. He was a fine fellow, my constant companion and cherished friend. Afraidof losing him, I kept a strict watch over his movements; for the first three days, however, he behaved like atolerably well−educated quadruped, and remained faithfully at my heels. At every impudent attack from hisMahomedan cousins, whether intended as a hostile demonstration or an overture of friendship, his only replywould be to draw in his tail between his legs, and with an air of dignified modesty seek protection under thewing of one or other of our party. As he had thus from the first shown so decided an aversion to bad company, I began to feel assured of hisdiscretion and by the end of the third day I had considerably relaxed my vigilance. This carelessness on mypart, however, was soon punished, and I was made to regret my misplaced confidence. In an unguardedmoment he listened to the voice of some four−footed syren, and the last I saw of him was the end of hisbushy tail, vanishing round the corner of a dirty, winding little back street. Greatly annoyed, I passed the remainder of the day in a vain search after my dumb companion, I offeredtwenty, thirty, forty francs reward for him. About as many vagabond Maltese began a regular chase, andtowards evening we were invaded in our hotel by the whole troop, every man of them with a more or lessmangy cur in his arms, which he tried to persuade me was my lost dog. The more I denied, the more solemnlythey insisted, one of them actually going down on his knees, snatching from his bosom an old corroded metalimage of the Virgin, and swearing a solemn oath that the Queen of Heaven herself had kindly appeared tohim to point out the right animal. The tumult had increased to such an extent that it looked as if Ralph'sdisappearance was going to be the cause of a small riot, and finally our landlord had to send for a couple ofKavasses from the nearest police station, and have this regiment of bipeds and quadrupeds expelled by mainforce. I began to be convinced that I should never see my dog again, and I was the more despondent since theporter of the hotel, a semi−respectable old brigand, who, to judge by appearances, had not passed more thanhalf−a−dozen years at the galleys, gravely assured me that all my pains were useless, as my spaniel wasundoubtedly dead and devoured too by this time, the Turkish dogs being very fond of their more toothsomeEnglish brothers. All this discussion had taken place in the street at the door of the hotel, and I was about to give up the searchfor that night at least, and enter the hotel, when an old Greek lady, a Phanariote who had been hearing thefracas from the steps of a door close by, approached our disconsolate group and suggested to Miss H−−−, oneof our party, that we should enquire of the dervishes concerning the fate of Ralph. And what can the dervishes know about my dog? said I, in no mood to joke, ridiculous as the propositionappeared. \"The holy men know all, Kyrea (Madam),\" said she, somewhat mysteriously. \"Last week I was robbed of mynew satin pelisse, that my son had just brought me from Broussa, and, as you all see, I have recovered it andhave it on my back now.\" \"Indeed? Then the holy men have also managed to metamorphose your new pelisse into an old one by allappearances,\" said one of the gentlemen who accompanied us, pointing as he spoke to a large rent in theback, which had been clumsily repaired with pins. \"And that is just the most wonderful part of the whole story,\" quietly answered the Phanariote, not in the leastdisconcerted. \"They showed me in the shining circle the quarter of the town, the house, and even the room inwhich the Jew who had stolen my pelisse was just about to rip it up and cut it into pieces. My son and I had Nightmare TalesTHE LUMINOUS SHIELD50"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"barely time to run over to the Kalindjikoulosek quarter, and to save my property. We caught the thief in thevery act, and we both recognized him as the man shown to us by the dervishes in the magic moon.

The monotonous cry of the Muezzins from the tops of the minarets had just proclaimed the hour of noon aswe, descending from the heights of Pera to the port of Galata, with difficulty managed to elbow our waythrough the unsavoury crowds of the commercial quarter of the town. Before we reached the docks, we hadbeen half deafened by the shouts and incessant ear−piercing cries and the Babel−like confusion of tongues. Inthis part of the city it is useless to expect to be guided by either house numbers, or names of streets. Thelocation of any desired place is indicated by its proximity to some other more conspicuous building such as amosque, bath, or European shop; for the rest, one has to trust to Allah and his prophet. It was with the greatest difficulty, therefore, that we finally discovered the British ship−chandler's store, atthe rear of which we were to find the place of our destination. Our hotel guide was as ignorant of thedervishes' abode as we were ourselves; but at last a small Greek, in all the simplicity of primitive undress,consented for a modest copper backsheesh to lead us to the dancers. When we arrived we were shown into a vast and gloomy hall that looked like a deserted stable. It was longand narrow, the floor was thickly strewn with sand as in a riding school, and it was lighted only by smallwindows placed at some height from the ground. The dervishes had finished their morning performances, andwere evidently resting from their exhausting labours. They looked completely prostrated, some lying about incorners, others sitting on their heels staring vacantly into space, engaged, as we were informed, in meditationon their invisible deity. They appeared to have lost all power of sight and hearing, for none of themresponded to our questions until a great gaunt figure, wearing a tall cap that made him look at least seven feethigh, emerged from an obscure corner. Informing us that he was their chief, the giant gave us to understandthat the saintly brethren, being in the habit of receiving orders for additional ceremonies from Allah himself,must on no account be disturbed. But when our interpreter had explained to him the object of our visit, whichconcerned himself alone, as he was the sole custodian of the \"divining rod,\" his objections vanished and heextended his hand for alms. Upon being gratified, he intimated that only two of our party could be admitted atone time into the confidence of the future, and led the way, followed by Miss H −− and myself. Plunging after him into what seemed to be a half subterranean passage, we were led to the foot of a tall ladderleading to a chamber under the roof. We scrambled up after our guide, and at the top we found ourselves in awretched garret of moderate size, with bare walls and destitute of furniture. The floor was carpeted with athick layer of dust, and cobwebs festooned the walls in neglected confusion. In the corner we saw somethingthat I at first mistook for a bundle of old rags; but the heap presently moved and got on its legs, advanced tothe middle of the room and stood before us, the most extraordinary looking creature that I ever beheld. Its sexwas female, but whether she was a woman or child it was impossible to decide. She was a hideous−lookingdwarf, with an enormous head, the shoulders of a grenadier, with a waist in proportion; the whole supportedby two short, lean, spider−like legs that seemed unequal to the task of bearing the weight of the monstrousbody. She had a grinning countenance like the face of a satyr, and it was ornamented with letters and signsfrom the Koran painted in bright yellow. On her forehead was a blood−red crescent; her head was crownedwith a dusty tarbouche, or fez; her legs were arrayed in large Turkish trousers, and some dirty white muslinwrapped round her body barely sufficed to conceal its hideous deformities. This creature rather let herself Nightmare TalesTHE LUMINOUS SHIELD51"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"drop than sat down in the middle of the floor, and as her weight descended on the rickety boards it sent up acloud of dust that set us coughing and sneezing. This was the famous Tatmos known as the Damascus oracle! Without losing time in idle talk, the dervish produced a piece of chalk, and traced around the girl a circleabout six feet in diameter. Fetching from behind the door twelve small copper lamps which he filled withsome dark liquid from a small bottle which he drew from his bosom, he placed them symmetrically aroundthe magic circle. He then broke a chip of wood from a panel of the half ruined door, which bore the marks ofmany a similar depredation, and, holding the chip between his thumb and finger he began blowing on it atregular intervals, alternating the blowing with mutterings of some kind of weird incantation, till suddenly,and without any apparent cause for its ignition, there appeared a spark on the chip and it blazed up like a drymatch. The dervish then lit the twelve lamps at this self−generated flame. During this process, Tatmos, who had sat till then altogether unconcerned and motionless, removed heryellow slippers from her naked feet, and throwing them into a corner, disclosed as an additional beauty, asixth toe on each deformed foot. The dervish now reached over into the circle and seizing the dwarf's anklesgave her a jerk, as if he had been lifting a bag of corn, and raised her clear off the ground, then, stepping backa pace, held her head downward. He shook her as one might a sack to pack its contents, the motion beingregular and easy. He then swung her to and fro like a pendulum until the necessary momentum was acquired,when letting go one foot and seizing the other with both hands, he made a powerful muscular effort andwhirled her round in the air as if she had been an Indian club. My companion had shrunk back in alarm to the farthest corner. Round and round the dervish swung his livingburden, she remained perfectly passive. The motion increased in rapidity until the eye could hardly follow thebody in its circuit. This continued for perhaps two or three minutes, until, gradually slackening the motion heat length stopped it altogether, and in an instant had landed the girl on her knees in the middle of the lamp−litcircle. Such was the Eastern mode of mesmerization as practised among the dervishes. And now the dwarf seemed entirely oblivious of external objects and in a deep trance. Her head and jawdropped on her chest, her eyes were glazed and staring, and altogether her appearance was even more hideousthan before. The dervish then carefully closed the shutters of the only window, and we should have been intotal obscurity but that there was a hole bored in it, through which entered a bright ray of sunlight that shotthrough the darkened room and shone upon the girl. He arranged her drooping head so that the ray should fallupon the crown, after which, motioning us to remain silent, he folded his arms upon his bosom, and, fixinghis gaze upon the bright spot, became as motionless as a stone image. I, too, riveted my eyes on the samespot, wondering what was to happen next, and how all this strange ceremony was to help me to find Ralph. By degrees, the bright patch, as if it had drawn through the sunbeam a greater splendour from without andcondensed it within its own area, shaped itself into a brilliant star, sending out rays in every direction as froma focus. A curious optical effect then occurred: the room, which had been previously partially lighted by the sunbeam,grew darker and darker as the star increased in radiance, until we found ourselves in an Egyptian gloom. Thestar twinkled, trembled and turned, at first with a slow gyratory motion, then faster and faster, increasing itscircumference at every rotation until it formed a brilliant disk, and we no longer saw the dwarf, who seemedabsorbed into its light. Having gradually attained an extremely rapid velocity, as the girl had done whenwhirled by the dervish, the motion began to decrease and finally merged into a feeble vibration, like theshimmer of moonbeams on rippling water. Then it flickered for a moment longer, emitted a few last flashes,and assuming the density and irridescence of an immense opal, it remained motionless. The disk now radiateda moon−like lustre, soft and silvery, but instead of illuminating the garret, it seemed only to intensify thedarkness. The edge of the circle was not penumbrous, but on the contrary sharply defined like that of a silvershield. Nightmare TalesTHE LUMINOUS SHIELD52"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"All being now ready, the dervish without uttering a word, or removing his gaze from the disk, stretched out ahand, and taking hold of mine, he drew me to his side and pointed to the luminous shield. Looking at theplace indicated, we saw large patches appear like those on the moon. These gradually formed themselves intofigures that began moving about in high relief in their natural colours. They neither appeared like aphotograph nor an engraving; still less like the reflection of images on a mirror, but as if the disk were acameo, and they were raised above its surface and then endowed with life and motion. To my astonishmentand my friend's consternation, we recognized the bridge leading from Galata to Stamboul spanning theGolden Horn from the new to the old city. There were the people hurrying to and fro, steamers and gaycaiques gliding on the blue Bosphorus, the many coloured buildings, villas and palaces reflected in the water;and the whole picture illuminated by the noonday sun. It passed like a panorama, but so vivid was theimpression that we could not tell whether it or ourselves were in motion. All was bustle and life, but not asound broke the oppressive stillness. It was noiseless as a dream. It was a phantom picture. Street after streetand quarter after quarter succeeded one another; there was the bazaar, with its narrow, roofed passages, thesmall shops on either side, the coffee houses with gravely smoking Turks; and as either they glided past us orwe past them, one of the smokers upset the narghile and coffee of another, and a volley of soundlessinvectives caused us great amusement. So we travelled with the picture until we came to a large building thatI recognized as the palace of the Minister of Finance. In a ditch behind the house, and close to a mosque,lying in a pool of mud with his silken coat all bedraggled, lay my poor Ralph! Panting and crouching down asif exhausted, he seemed to be in a dying condition; and near him were gathered some sorry−looking curs wholay blinking in the sun and snapping at the flies! I had seen all that I desired, although I had not breathed a word about the dog to the dervish, and had comemore out of curiosity than with the idea of any success. I was impatient to leave at once and recover Ralph,but as my companion besought me to remain a little while longer, I reluctantly consented. The scene fadedaway and Miss H−−− placed herself in turn by the side of the dervish. \"I will think of him,\" she whispered in my ear with the eager tone that young ladies generally assume whentalking of the worshipped him. There is a long stretch of sand and a blue sea with white waves dancing in the sun, and a great steamer isploughing her way along past a desolate shore, leaving a milky track behind her. The deck is full of life, themen are busy forward, the cook with white cap and apron is coming out of the galley, uniformed officers aremoving about, passengers fill the quarter−deck, lounging, flirting or reading, and a young man we bothrecognize comes forward and leans over the taffrail. It is −− him. Miss H−−− gives a little gasp, blushes and smiles, and concentrates her thoughts again. The picture of thesteamer vanishes; the magic moon remains for a few moments blank. But new spots appear on its luminousface, we see a library slowly emerging from its depths −− a library with green carpet and hangings, andbook−shelves round the sides of the room. Seated in an arm−chair at a table under a hanging lamp, is an oldgentleman writing. His gray hair is brushed back from his forehead, his face is smooth−shaven and hiscountenance has an expression of benignity. The dervish made a hasty motion to enjoin silence; the light on the disk quivers, but resumes its steadybrilliancy, and again its surface is imageless for a second. We are back in Constantinople now and out of the pearly, depths of the shield forms our own apartment in thehotel. There are our papers and books on the bureau, my friend's travelling hat in a corner, her ribbonshanging on the glass, and lying on the bed the very dress she had changed when starting out on ourexpedition. No detail was lacking to make the identification complete; and as if to prove that we were notseeing something conjured up in our imagination, there lay upon the dressing−table two unopened letters, thehandwriting on which was clearly recognized by my friend. They were from a very dear relative of hers, from Nightmare TalesTHE LUMINOUS SHIELD53"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"whom she had expected to hear when in Athens, but had been disappointed. The scene faded away and wenow saw her brother's room with himself lying upon the lounge, and a servant bathing his head, whence toour horror, blood was trickling. We had left the boy in perfect health but an hour before; and upon seeing thispicture my companion uttered a cry of alarm, and seizing me by the hand dragged me to the door. Werejoined our guide and friends in the long hall and hurried back to the hotel. Young H−−− had fallen downstairs and cut his forehead rather badly; in our room, on the dressing−tablewere the two letters which had arrived in our absence. They had been forwarded from Athens. Ordering acarriage I at once drove to the Ministry of Finance, and alighting with the guide, hurriedly made for the ditchI had seen for the first time in the shining disk! In the middle of the pool, badly mangled, half−famished, butstill alive, lay my beautiful spaniel Ralph, and near him were the blinking curs, unconcernedly snapping atthe flies.THE CAVE OF THE ECHOESA Strange but True Story** This story is given from the narrative of an eye−witness, a Russian gentleman, very pious,and fully trustworthy. Moreover, the facts are copied from the police records of P−−−. Theeye−witness in question attributes it, of course, partly to divine interference and partly to theEvil One. −− H. P. B. In one of the distant governments of the Russian empire, in a small town on the borders of Siberia, amysterious tragedy occurred more than thirty years ago. About six versts from the little town of P−−−,famous for the wild beauty of its scenery, and for the wealth of its inhabitants −− generally proprietors ofmines and of iron foundries −− stood an aristocratic mansion. Its household consisted of the master, a rich oldbachelor and his brother, who was a widower and the father of two sons and three daughters. It was known that the proprietor, Mr. Izvertzoff, had adopted his brother's children, and, having formed anespecial attachment for his eldest nephew, Nicolas, he made him the sole heir of his numerous estates. Time rolled on. The uncle was getting old, the nephew was coming of age. Days and years had passed inmonotonous serenity, when, on the hitherto clear horizon of the quiet family, appeared a cloud. On anunlucky day one of the nieces took it into her head to study the zither. The instrument being of purelyTeutonic origin, and no teacher of it residing in the neighbourhood, the indulgent uncle sent to St. Petersburgfor both. After diligent search only one Professor could be found willing to trust himself in such closeproximity to Siberia. It was an old German artist, who, sharing his affections equally between his instrumentand a pretty blonde daughter, would part with neither. And thus it came to pass that, one fine morning, the oldProfessor arrived at the mansion, with his music box under one arm and his fair Munchen leaning on theother. From that day the little cloud began growing rapidly; for every vibration of the melodious instrument found aresponsive echo in the old bachelor's heart. Music awakens love, they say, and the work begun by the zitherwas completed by Munchen's blue eyes. At the expiration of six months the niece had become an expertzither player, and the uncle was desperately in love. One morning, gathering his adopted family around him, he embraced them all very tenderly, promised toremember them in his will, and wound up by declaring his unalterable resolution to marry the blue−eyedMunchen. After this he fell upon their necks, and wept in silent rapture. The family, understanding that they Nightmare TalesTHE CAVE OF THE ECHOES54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"were cheated out of the inheritance, also wept; but it was for another cause. Having thus wept, they consoledthemselves and tried to rejoice, for the old gentleman was sincerely beloved by all. Not all of them rejoiced,though. Nicolas, who had himself been smitten to the heart by the pretty German, and who found himselfdefrauded at once of his belle and of his uncle's money, neither rejoiced nor consoled himself, butdisappeared for a whole day. Meanwhile, Mr. Izvertzoff had given orders to prepare his traveling carriage on the following day, and it waswhispered that he was going to the chief town of the district, at some distance from his home, with theintention of altering his will. Though very wealthy, he had no superintendent on his estate, but kept his bookshimself. The same evening after supper, he was heard in his room, angrily scolding his servant, who had beenin his service for over thirty years. This man, Ivan, was a native of northern Asia, from Kamschatka; he hadbeen brought up by the family in the Christian religion, and was thought to be very much attached to hismaster. A few days later, when the first tragic circumstance I am about to relate had brought all the policeforce to the spot, it was remembered that on that night Ivan was drunk; that his master, who had a horror ofthis vice, had paternally thrashed him, and turned him out of his room, and that Ivan had been seen reelingout of the door, and had been heard to mutter threats. On the vast domain of Mr. Izvertzoff there was a curious cavern, which excited the curiosity of all whovisited it. It exists to this day, and is well known to every inhabitant of P−−−. A pine forest, commencing afew feet from the garden gate, climbs in steep terraces up a long range of rocky hills, which it covers with abroad belt of impenetrable vegetation. The grotto leading into the cavern, which is known as the \"Cave of theEchoes,\" is situated about half a mile from the site of the mansion, from which it appears as a smallexcavation in the hillside, almost hidden by luxuriant plants, but not so completely as to prevent any personentering it from being readily seen from the terrace in front of the house. Entering the grotto, the explorerfinds at the rear a narrow cleft; having passed through which he emerges into a lofty cavern, feebly lightedthrough fissures in the vaulted roof, fifty feet from the ground. The cavern itself is immense, and would easilyhold between two and three thousand people. A part of it, in the days of Mr. Izvertzoff, was paved withflagstones, and was often used in the summer as a ball−room by picnic parties. Of an irregular oval, itgradually narrows into a broad corridor, which runs for several miles underground, opening here and thereinto other chambers, as large and lofty as the ball−room, but, unlike this, impassable otherwise than in a boat,as they are always full of water. These natural basins have the reputation of being unfathomable. On the margin of the first of these is a small platform, with several mossy rustic seats arranged on it, and it isfrom this spot that the phenomenal echoes, which give the cavern its name, are heard in all their weirdness. Aword pronounced in a whisper, or even a sigh, is caught up by endless mocking voices, and instead ofdiminishing in volume, as honest echoes do, the sound grows louder and louder at every successiverepetition, until at last it bursts forth like the repercussion of a pistol shot, and recedes in a plaintive waildown the corridor. On the day in question, Mr. Izvertzoff had mentioned his intention of having a dancing party in this cave onhis wedding day, which he had fixed for an early date. On the following morning, while preparing for hisdrive, he was seen by his family entering the grotto, accompanied only by his Siberian servant. Half−an−hourlater, Ivan returned to the mansion for a snuff−box which his master had forgotten in his room, and went backwith it to the cave. An hour later the whole house was startled by his loud cries. Pale and dripping with water,Ivan rushed in like a madman, and declared that Mr. Izvertzoff was nowhere to be found in the cave.Thinking he had fallen into the lake, he had dived into the first basin in search of him and was nearlydrowned himself. The day passed in vain attempts to find the body. The police filled the house, and louder than the rest in hisdespair was Nicolas, the nephew, who had returned home only to meet the sad tidings. Nightmare TalesTHE CAVE OF THE ECHOES55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"A dark suspicion fell upon Ivan, the Siberian. He had been struck by his master the night before, and hadbeen heard to swear revenge. He had accompanied him alone to the cave, and when his room was searched abox full of rich family jewellery, known to have been carefully kept in Mr. Izvertzoff's apartment, was foundunder Ivan's bedding. Vainly did the serf call God to witness that the box had been given to him in charge byhis master himself, just before they proceeded to the cave; that it was the latter's purpose to have the jewelleryreset, as he intended it for a wedding present to his bride; and that he, Ivan, would willingly give his own lifeto recall that of his master, if he knew him to be dead. No heed was paid to him, however, and he wasarrested and thrown into prison, upon a charge of murder. There he was left, for under the Russian law acriminal cannot −− at any rate, he could not in those days −− be sentenced for a crime, however conclusivethe circumstantial evidence, unless he confessed his guilt. After a week had passed in useless search, the family arrayed themselves in deep mourning; and as the will asoriginally drawn remained without a codicil, the whole of the property passed into the hands of the nephew.The old teacher and his daughter bore this sudden reverse of fortune with true Germanic phlegm, andprepared to depart. Taking again his zither under one arm, the old man was about to lead away his Munchenby the other, when the nephew stopped him by offering himself as the fair damsel's husband in the place ofhis departed uncle. The change was found to be an agreeable one, and, without much ado, the young peoplewere married. Ten years rolled away, and we meet the happy family once more at the beginning of 1859. The fair Munchenhad grown fat and vulgar. From the day of the old man's disappearance, Nicolas had become morose andretired in his habits, and many wondered at the change in him, for now he was never seen to smile. It seemedas if his only aim in life were to find out his uncle's murderer, or rather to bring Ivan to confess his guilt. Butthe man still persisted that he was innocent. An only son had been born to the young couple, and a strange child it was. Small, delicate, and ever ailing,his frail life seemed to hang by a thread. When his features were in repose, his resemblance to his uncle wasso striking that the members of the family often shrank from him in terror. It was the pale shrivelled face of aman of sixty upon the shoulders of a child nine years old. He was never seen either to laugh or to play, but,perched in his high chair, would gravely sit there, folding his arms in a way peculiar to the late Mr.Izvertzoff; and thus he would remain for hours, drowsy and motionless. His nurses were often seen furtivelycrossing themselves at night, upon approaching him, and not one of them would consent to sleep alone withhim in the nursery. His father's behaviour towards him was still more strange. He seemed to love himpassionately, and at the same time to hate him bitterly. He seldom embraced or caressed the child, but withlivid cheek and staring eye, he would pass long hours watching him, as the child sat quietly in his corner, inhis goblin−like, old−fashioned way. The child had never left the estate, and few outside the family knew of his existence. About the middle of July, a tall Hungarian traveller, preceded by a great reputation for eccentricity, wealthand mysterious powers, arrived at the town of P−−− from the North, where, it was said, he had resided formany years. He settled in the little town, in company with a Shaman or South Siberian magician, on whom hewas said to make mesmeric experiments. He gave dinners and parties, and invariably exhibited his Shaman,of whom he felt very proud, for the amusement of his guests. One day the notables of P−−− made anunexpected invasion of the domains of Nicolas Izvertzoff, and requested the loan of his cave for an eveningentertainment. Nicolas consented with great reluctance, and only after still greater hesitancy was he prevailedupon to join the party. The first cavern and the platform beside the bottomless lake glittered with lights. Hundreds of flickeringcandles and torches, stuck in the clefts of the rocks, illuminated the place and drove the shadows from themossy nooks and corners, where they had crouched undisturbed for many years. The stalactites on the walls Nightmare TalesTHE CAVE OF THE ECHOES56"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"sparkled brightly, and the sleeping echoes were suddenly awakened by a joyous confusion of laughter andconversation. The Shaman, who was never lost sight of by his friend and patron, sat in a corner, entranced asusual. Crouched on a projecting rock, about midway between the entrance and the water, with hislemon−yellow, wrinkled face, flat nose, and thin beard, he looked more like an ugly stone idol than a humanbeing. Many of the company pressed around him and received correct answers to their questions, theHungarian cheerfully submitting his mesmerized \"subject\" to cross−examination. Suddenly one of the party, a lady, remarked that it was in that very cave that old Mr. Izvertzoff had sounaccountably disappeared ten years before. The foreigner appeared interested, and desired to learn more ofthe circumstances, so Nicolas was sought amid the crowd and led before the eager group. He was the host andhe found it impossible to refuse the demanded narrative. He repeated the sad tale in a trembling voice, with apallid cheek, and tears were seen glittering in his feverish eyes. The company were greatly affected, andencomiums upon the behaviour of the loving nephew in honouring the memory of his uncle and benefactorwere freely circulating in whispers, when suddenly the voice of Nicolas became choked, his eyes started fromtheir sockets, and, with a suppressed groan, he staggered back. Every eye in the crowd followed withcuriosity his haggard look, as it fell and remained riveted upon a weakened little face, that peeped frombehind the back of the Hungarian. \"Where do you come from? Who brought you here, child?\" gasped out Nicolas, as pale as death. \"I was in bed, papa; this man came to me, and brought me here in his arms,\" answered the boy simply,pointing to the Shaman, beside whom he stood upon the rock, and who, with his eyes closed, kept swayinghimself to and fro like a living pendulum. \"That is very strange,\" remarked one of the guests, \"for the man has never moved from his place.\" \"Good God! what an extraordinary resemblance!\" muttered an old resident of the town, a friend of the lostman. \"You lie, child!\" fiercely exclaimed the father. \"Go to bed; this is no place for you.\" \"Come, come,\" interposed the Hungarian, with a strange expression on his face, and encircling with his armthe slender childish figure; \"the little fellow has seen the double of my Shaman, which roams sometimes faraway from his body, and has mistaken the phantom for the man himself. Let him remain with us for a while.\" At these strange words the guests stared at each other in mute surprise, while some piously made the sign ofthe cross, spitting aside, presumably at the devil and all his works. \"By−the−bye,\" continued the Hungarian with a peculiar firmness of accent, and addressing the companyrather than any one in particular; \"why should we not try, with the help of my Shaman, to unravel the mysteryhanging over the tragedy? Is the suspected party still lying in prison? What? he has not confessed up to now?This is surely very strange. But now we will learn the truth in a few minutes! Let all keep silent!\" He then approached the Tehuktchene, and immediately began his performance without so much as asking theconsent of the master of the place. The latter stood rooted to the spot, as if petrified with horror, and unable toarticulate a word. The suggestion met with general approbation, save from him; and the police inspector, Col.S−−−, especially approved of the idea. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said the mesmerizer in soft tones, \"allow me for this once to proceed otherwise thanin my general fashion. I will employ the method of native magic. It is more appropriate to this wild place, andfar more effective as you will find, than our European method of mesmerization.\" Nightmare TalesTHE CAVE OF THE ECHOES57"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Without waiting for an answer, he drew from a bag that never left his person, first a small drum, and then twolittle phials −− one full of fluid, the other empty. With the contents of the former he sprinkled the Shaman,who fell to trembling and nodding more violently than ever. The air was filled with the perfume of spicyodours, and the atmosphere itself seemed to become clearer. Then, to the horror of those present, heapproached the Tibetan, and taking a miniature stiletto from his pocket, he plunged the sharp steel into theman's forearm, and drew blood from it, which he caught in the empty phial. When it was half filled, hepressed the orifice of the wound with his thumb, and stopped the flow of blood as easily as if he had corked abottle, after which he sprinkled the blood over the little boy's head. He then suspended the drum from hisneck, and, with two ivory drum−sticks, which were covered with magic signs and letters, he began beating asort of reveille, to drum up the spirits, as he said. The bystanders, half−shocked and half−terrified by these extraordinary proceedings, eagerly crowded roundhim, and for a few moments a dead silence reigned throughout the lofty cavern. Nicolas, with his face lividand corpse−like, stood speechless as before. The mesmerizer had placed himself between the Shaman and theplatform, when he began slowly drumming. The first notes were muffled, and vibrated so softly in the air thatthey awakened no echo, but the Shaman quickened his pendulum−like motion and the child became restless.The drummer then began a slow chant, low, impressive and solemn. As the unknown words issued from his lips, the flames of the candles and torches wavered and flickered,until they began dancing in rhythm with the chant. A cold wind came wheezing from the dark corridorsbeyond the water, leaving a plaintive echo in its trail. Then a sort of nebulous vapour, seeming to ooze fromthe rocky ground and walls, gathered about the Shaman and the boy. Around the latter the aura was silveryand transparent, but the cloud which enveloped the former was red and sinister. Approaching nearer to theplatform the magician beat a louder roll upon the drum, and this time the echo caught it up with terrificeffect! It reverberated near and far in incessant peals; one wail followed another louder and louder, until thethundering roar seemed the chorus of a thousand demon voices rising from the fathomless depths of the lake.The water itself, whose surface, illuminated by many lights, had previously been smooth as a sheet of glass,became suddenly agitated, as if a powerful gust of wind had swept over its unruffled face. Another chant, anda roll of the drum, and the mountain trembled to its foundation with the cannon−like peals which rolledthrough the dark and distant corridors. The Shaman's body rose two yards in the air, and nodding andswaying, sat, self−suspended like an apparition. But the transformation which now occurred in the boychilled everyone, as they speechlessly watched the scene. The silvery cloud about the boy now seemed to lifthim, too, into the air; but, unlike the Shaman, his feet never left the ground. The child began to grow, asthough the work of years was miraculously accomplished in a few seconds. He became tall and large, and hissenile features grew older with the ageing of his body. A few more seconds, and the youthful form hadentirely disappeared. It was totally absorbed in another individuality, and, to the horror of those present whohad been familiar with his appearance, this individuality was that of old Mr. Izvertzoff, and on his temple wasa large gaping wound, from which trickled great drops of blood. This phantom moved towards Nicolas, till it stood directly in front of him, while he, with his hair standingerect, with the look of a madman gazed at his own son, transformed into his uncle. The sepulchral silence wasbroken by the Hungarian, who, addressing the child phantom, asked him, in solemn voice: \"In the name of the great Master, of Him who has all power, answer the truth, and nothing but the truth.Restless spirit, hast thou been lost by accident, or foully murdered?\" The spectre's lips moved, but it was the echo which answered for them in lugubrious shouts: \"Murdered!mur−der−ed!! murdered!!!\" \"Where? How? By whom?\" asked the conjuror. Nightmare TalesTHE CAVE OF THE ECHOES58"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The apparition pointed a finger at Nicolas and, without removing its gaze or lowering its arms, retreatedbackwards slowly towards the lake. At every step it took, the younger Izvertzoff, as if compelled by someirresistable fascination, advanced a step towards it, until the phantom reached the lake, and the next momentwas seen gliding on its surface. It was a fearful, ghostly scene! When he had come within two steps of the brink of the watery abyss, a violent convulsion ran through theframe of the guilty man. Flinging himself upon his knees, he clung to one of the rustic seats with a desperateclutch, and staring wildly, uttered a long piercing cry of agony. The phantom now remained motionless onthe water, and bending his extended finger, slowly beckoned him to come. Crouched in abject terror, thewretched man shrieked until the cavern rang again and again: \"I did not . . . No, I did not murder you!\" Then came a splash, and now it was the boy who was in the dark water, struggling for his life, in the middleof the lake, with the same motionless stern apparition brooding over him. \"Papa! papa! Save me . . . I am drowning!\" . . . cried a piteous little voice amid the uproar of the mockingechoes. \"My boy!\" shrieked Nicolas, in the accents of a maniac, springing to his feet. \"My boy! Save him! Oh, savehim! . . . Yes I confess . . . I am the murderer . . . It is I who killed him!\" Another splash, and the phantom disappeared. With a cry of horror the company rushed towards the platform;but their feet were suddenly rooted to the ground, as they saw amid the swirling eddies a whitish shapelessmass holding the murderer and the boy in tight embrace, and slowly sinking into the bottomless lake . . . On the morning after these occurrences, when, after a sleepless night, some of the party visited the residenceof the Hungarian gentleman, they found it closed and deserted. He and the Shaman had disappeared. Manyare among the old inhabitants of P−−− who remember him; the Police Inspector, Col. S−−−, dying a fewyears ago in the full assurance that the noble traveller was the devil. To add to the general consternation theIzvertzoff mansion took fire on that same night and was completely destroyed. The Archbishop performedthe ceremony of exorcism, but the locality is considered accursed to this day. The Government investigatedthe facts, and ordered silence.FROM THE POLAR LANDSA Christmas StoryJust a year ago, during the Christmas holidays, a numerous society had gathered in the country house, orrather the old hereditary castle, of a wealthy landowner in Finland. Many were the remains in it of ourforefathers' hospitable way of living; and many the mediaeval customs preserved, founded on traditions andsuperstitions, semi−kinnish and semi−Russian, the latter imported into it by its female proprietors from theshores of the Neva. Christmas trees were being prepared and implements for divination were being madeready. For, in that old castle there were grim worm−eaten portraits of famous ancestors and knights andladies, old deserted turrets, with bastions and Gothic windows; mysterious sombre alleys, and dark andendless cellers, easily transformed into subterranean passages and caves, ghostly prison cells, haunted by therestless phantoms of the heroes of local legends. In short, the old Manor offered every commodity forromantic horrors. But alas! this once they serve for nought; in the present narrative these dear old horrors playno such part as they otherwise might. Its chief hero is a very commonplace, prosaical man −− let us call him Erkler. Yes; Dr. Erkler, professor of Nightmare TalesFROM THE POLAR LANDS59"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"medicine, half−German through his father, a full−blown Russian on his mother's side and by education; andone who looked a rather heavily built, and ordinary mortal. Nevertheless, very extraordinary things happenedwith him. Erkler, as it turned out, was a great traveller, who by his own choice had accompanied one of the mostfamous explorers on his journeys round the world. More than once they had both seen death face to face fromsunstrokes under the Tropics, from cold in the Polar Regions. All this notwithstanding, the doctor spoke witha never−abating enthusiasm about their \"winterings\" in Greenland and Novaya Zemla, and about the desertplains in Australia, where he lunched off a kangaroo and dined off an emu, and almost perished of thirstduring the passage through a waterless track, which it took them forty hours to cross. \"Yes,\" he used to remark, \"I have experienced almost everything, save what you would describe assupernatural. . . . . This, of course, if we throw out of account a certain extraordinary event in my life −− aman I met, of whom I will tell you just now −− and its . . . indeed, rather strange, I may add quiteinexplicable, results.\" There was a loud demand that he should explain himself; and the doctor, forced to yield, began his narrative. \"In 1878 we were compelled to winter on the northwestern coast of Spitzbergen. We had been attempting tofind our way during the short summer to the pole; but, as usual, the attempt had proved a failure, owing to theicebergs, and, after several such fruitless endeavours, we had to give it up. No sooner had we settled than thepolar night descended upon us, our steamers got wedged in and frozen between the blocks of ice in the Gulfof Mussel, and we found ourselves cut off for eight long months from the rest of the living world. I confess I,for one, felt it terribly at first. We became especially discouraged when one stormy night the snow hurricanescattered a mass of materials prepared for our winter buildings, and deprived us of over forty deer from ourherd. Starvation in prospect is no incentive to good humour; and with the deer we had lost the best plat deresistance against polar frosts, human organisms demanding in that climate an increase of heating and solidfood. However, we were finally reconciled to our loss, and even got accustomed to the local and in realitymore nutritious food −− seals, and seal−grease. Our men from the remnants of our lumber built a houseneatly divided into two compartments, one for our three professors and myself, and the other for themselves;and, a few wooden sheds being constructed for meteorological, astronomical and magnetic purposes, we evenadded a protecting stable for the few remaining deer. And then began the monotonous series of dawnlessnights and days, hardly distinguishable one from the other, except through dark−grey shadows. At times, the\"blues\" we got into, were fearful! We had contemplated sending two of our three steamers home, inSeptember, but the premature, and unforeseen formation of ice walls round them had thwarted our plans; andnow, with the entire crews on our hands, we had to economise still more with our meagre provisions, fuel andlight. Lamps were used only for scientific purposes: the rest of the time we had to content ourselves withGod's light −− the moon and the Aurora Borealis . . . . But how describe these glorious, incomparablenorthern lights! Rings, arrows, gigantic conflagrations of accurately divided rays of the most vivid and variedcolours. The November moonlight nights were as gorgeous. The play of moonbeams on the snow and thefrozen rocks was most striking. These were fairy nights. \"Well, one such night −− it may have been one such day, for all I know, as from the end of November toabout the middle of March we had no twilights at all, to distinguish the one from the other −− we suddenlyespied in the play of coloured beams, which were then throwing a golden rosy hue on the snow plains, a darkmoving spot. . . . . It grew, and seemed to scatter as it approached nearer to us. What did this mean? . . . . Itlooked like a herd of cattle, or a group of living men, trotting over the snowy wilderness . . . . But animalsthere were white like everything else. What then was this? . . . . human beings? . . . . \"We could not believe our eyes. Yes, a group of men was approaching our dwelling. It turned out to be aboutfifty seal−hunters, guided by Matiliss, a well−known veteran mariner from Norway. They had been caught by Nightmare TalesFROM THE POLAR LANDS60"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"the icebergs, just as we had been. \"'How did you know that we were here?' we asked. \"'Old Johan, this very same old party, showed us the way' −− they answered, pointing to a venerable−lookingold man with snow−white locks. \"In sober truth, it would have beseemed their guide far better to have sat at home over his fire than to havebeen seal−hunting in polar lands with younger men. And we told them so, still wondering how he came tolearn of our presence in this kingdom of white bears. At this Matiliss and his companions smiled, assuring usthat 'old Johan' knew all. They remarked that we must be novices in polar borderlands, since we wereignorant of Johan's personality and could still wonder at anything said of him. \"'It is nigh forty−five years,' said the chief hunter, that I have been catching seals in the Polar Seas, and as faras my personal remembrance goes, I have always known him, and just as he is now, an old, white−beardedman. And, so far back as in the days when I used to go to sea, as a small boy with my father, my dad used totell me the same of old Johan, and he added that his own father and grandfather too, had known Johan in theirdays of boyhood, none of them having ever seen him otherwise than white as our snows. And, as ourfore−fathers nicknamed him \"the white−haired all−knower,\" thus do we, the seal−hunters, call him, to thisday.' \"'Would you make us believe he is two hundred years old?' −− we laughed. \"Some of our sailors crowding round the white−haired phenomenon, plied him with questions. \"'Grandfather! answer us, how old are you?' \"'I really do not know it myself, sonnies. I live as long as God has decreed me to. As to my years, I nevercounted them.' \"'And how did you know, grandfather, that we were wintering in this place?' \"'God guided me. How I learned it I do not know; save that I knew −− I knew it.\"'THE ENSOULED VIOLINBy H. P. Blavatsky IIn the year 1828, an old German, a music teacher, came to Paris with his pupil and settled unostentatiously inone of the quiet faubourgs of the metropolis. The first rejoiced in the name of Samuel Klaus; the secondanswered to the more poetical appellation of Franz Stenio. The younger man was a violinist, gifted, asrumour went, with extraordinary, almost miraculous talent. Yet as he was poor and had not hitherto made aname for himself in Europe, he remained for several years in the capital of France −− the heart and pulse ofcapricious continental fashion −− unknown and unappreciated. Franz was a Styrian by birth, and, at the timeof the event to be presently described, he was a young man considerably under thirty. A philosopher and adreamer by nature, imbued with all the mystic oddities of true genius, he reminded one of some of the heroesin Hoffmann's Contes Fantastiques. His earlier existence had been a very unusual, in fact, quite an eccentric Nightmare TalesTHE ENSOULED VIOLIN61"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"one, and its history must be briefly told −− for the better understanding of the present story. Born of very pious country people, in a quiet burg among the Styrian Alps; nursed \"by the native gnomeswho watched over his cradle\"; growing up in the weird atmosphere of the ghouls and vampires who play sucha prominent part in the household of every Styrian and Slavonian in Southern Austria; educated later, as astudent in the shadow of the old Rhenish castles of Germany; Franz from his childhood had passed throughevery emotional stage on the plane of the so−called \"supernatural.\" He had also studied at one time the\"occult arts\" with an enthusiastic disciple of Paracelsus and Kunrath; alchemy had few theoretical secrets forhim; and he had dabbled in \"ceremonial magic\" and \"sorcery\" with some Hungarian Tziganes. Yet he lovedabove all else music, and above music −− his violin. At the age of twenty−two he suddenly gave up his practical studies in the occult, and from that day, though asdevoted as ever in thought to the beautiful Grecian Gods, he surrendered himself entirely to his art. Of hisclassic studies he had retained only that which related to the muses −− Euterpe especially, at whose altar heworshipped −− and Orpheus whose magic lyre he tried to emulate with his violin. Except his dreamy belief inthe nymphs and the sirens, on account probably of the double relationship of the latter to the muses, throughCalliope and Orpheus, he was interested but little in the matters of this sublunary world. All his aspirationsmounted, like incense, with the wave of the heavenly harmony that he drew from his instrument, to a higherand a nobler sphere. He dreamed awake, and lived a real though an enchanted life only during those hourswhen his magic bow carried him along the wave of sound to the Pagan Olympus, to the feet of Euterpe. Astrange child he had ever been in his own home, where tales of magic and witchcraft grow out of every inchof the soil; a still stranger boy he had become, until finally he had blossomed into manhood, without onesingle characteristic of youth. Never had a fair face attracted his attention; not for one moment had histhoughts turned from his solitary studies to a life beyond that of a mystic Bohemian. Content with his owncompany, he had thus passed the best years of his youth and manhood with his violin for his chief idol, andwith the Gods and Goddesses of old Greece for his audience, in perfect ignorance of practical life. His wholeexistence had been one long day of dreams, of melody and sunlight, and he had never felt any otheraspirations. How useless, but oh, how glorious those dreams! how vivid! and why should he desire any better fate? Washe not all that he wanted to be, transformed in a second of thought into one or another hero; from Orpheus,who held all nature breathless, to the urchin who piped away under the plane tree to the naiads of Calirrhoe'scrystal fountain? Did not the swift−footed nymphs frolic at his beck and call to the sound of the magic fluteof the Arcadian shepherd −− who was himself? Behold, the Goddess of Love and Beauty herself descendingfrom on high, attracted by the sweet−voiced notes of his violin! . . . Yet there came a time when he preferredSyrinx to Aphrodite −− not as the fair nymph pursued by Pan, but after her transformation by the mercifulGods into the reed out of which the frustrated God of the Shepherds had made his magic pipe. For also, withtime, ambition grows and is rarely satisfied. When he tried to emulate on his violin the enchanting soundsthat resounded in his mind, the whole of Parnassus kept silent under the spell, or joined in heavenly chorus;but the audience he finally craved was composed of more than the Gods sung by Hesiod, verily of the mostappreciative melomanes of European capitals. He felt jealous of the magic pipe, and would fain have had it athis command. \"Oh! that I could allure a nymph into my beloved violin!\" −− he often cried, after awakening from one of hisday−dreams. \"Oh, that I could only span in spirit flight the abyss of Time! Oh, that I could find myself forone short day a partaker of the secret arts of the Gods, a God myself, in the sight and hearing of enrapturedhumanity; and, having learned the mystery of the lyre of Orpheus, or secured within my violin a siren,thereby benefit mortals to my own glory!\" Thus, having for long years dreamed in the company of the Gods of his fancy, he now took to dreaming ofthe transitory glories of fame upon this earth. But at this time he was suddenly called home by his widowed Nightmare TalesTHE ENSOULED VIOLIN62"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"mother from one of the German universities where he had lived for the last year or two. This was an eventwhich brought his plans to an end, at least so far as the immediate future was concerned, for he had hithertodrawn upon her alone for his meagre pittance, and his means were not sufficient for an independent lifeoutside his native place. His return had a very unexpected result. His mother, whose only love he was on earth, died soon after she hadwelcomed her Benjamin back; and the good wives of the burg exercised their swift tongues for many a monthafter as to the real causes of that death. Frau Stenio, before Franz's return, was a healthy, buxom, middle−aged body, strong and hearty. She was apious and a God−fearing soul too, who had never failed in saying her prayers, nor had missed an early massfor years during his absence. On the first Sunday after her son had settled at home −− a day that she had beenlonging for and had anticipated for months in joyous visions, in which she saw him kneeling by her side inthe little church on the hill −− she called him from the foot of the stairs. The hour had come when her piousdream was to be realized, and she was waiting for him, carefully wiping the dust from the prayer−book hehad used in his boyhood. But instead of Franz, it was his violin that responded to her call, mixing its sonorousvoice with the rather cracked tones of the peal of the merry Sunday bells. The fond mother was somewhatshocked at hearing the prayer−inspiring sounds drowned by the weird, fantastic notes of the \"Dance of theWitches\"; they seemed to her so unearthly and mocking. But she almost fainted upon hearing the definiterefusal of her well−beloved son to go to church. He never went to church, he coolly remarked. It was loss oftime; besides which, the loud peals of the old church organ jarred on his nerves. Nothing should induce himto submit to the torture of listening to that cracked organ. He was firm, and nothing could move him. To hersupplications and remonstrances he put an end by offering to play for her a \" Hymn to the Sun\" he had justcomposed. From that −− memorable Sunday morning, Frau Stenio lost her usual serenity of mind. She hastened to, layher sorrows and seek for consolation at the foot of the confessional; but that which she heard in responsefrom the stem priest filled her gentle and unsophisticated soul with dismay and almost with despair. A feelingof fear, a sense of profound terror, which soon became a chronic state with her, pursued her from thatmoment; her nights became disturbed and sleepless, her days passed in prayer and lamentations. In hermaternal anxiety for the salvation of her beloved son's soul, and for his post mortem welfare, she made aseries of rash vows. Finding that neither the Latin petition to the Mother of God written for her by herspiritual adviser, nor yet the humble supplications in German, addressed by herself to every saint she hadreason to believe was residing in Paradise, worked the desired effect, she took to pilgrimages to distantshrines. During one of these journeys to a holy chapel situated high up in the mountains, she caught cold,amidst the glaciers of the Tyrol, and redescended only to take to a sick bed, from which she arose no more.Frau Stenio's vow had led her, in one sense, to the desired result. The poor woman was now given anopportunity of seeking out in propria persona the saints she had believed in so well, and of pleading face toface for the recreant son, who refused adherence to them and to the Church, scoffed at monk andconfessional, and held the organ in such horror. Franz sincerely lamented his mother's death. Unaware of being the indirect cause of it, he felt no remorse; butselling the modest household goods and chattels, light in purse and heart, he resolved to travel on foot for ayear or two, before settling down to any definite profession. A hazy desire to see the great cities of Europe, and to try his luck in France, lurked at the bottom of thistravelling project, but his Bohemian habits of life were too strong to be abruptly abandoned. He placed hissmall capital with a banker for a rainy day, and started on his pedestrian journey via Germany and Austria.His violin paid for his board and lodging in the inns and farms on his way, and he passed his days in thegreen fields and in the solemn silent woods, face to face with Nature, dreaming all the time as usual with hiseyes open. During the three months of his pleasant travels to and fro, he never descended for one moment Nightmare TalesTHE ENSOULED VIOLIN63"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"from Parnassus; but, as an alchemist transmutes lead into gold, so he transformed everything on his way intoa song of Hesiod or Anacreon. Every evening, while fiddling for his supper and bed, whether on a green lawnor in the hall of a rustic inn, his fancy changed the whole scene for him. Village swains and maidens becametransfigured into Arcadian shepherds and nymphs. The sand−covered floor was now a green sward; theuncouth couples spinning round in a measured waltz with the wild grace of tamed bears became priests andpriestesses of Terpsichore; the bulky, cherry−cheeked and blue−eyed daughters of rural Germany were theHesperides circling round the trees laden with the golden apples. Nor did the melodious strains of theArcadian demigods piping on their syrinxes, and audible but to his own enchanted ear, vanish with the dawn.For no sooner was the curtain of sleep raised from his eyes than he would sally forth into a new magic realmof day−dreams. On his way to some dark and solemn pine−forest, he played incessantly, to himself and toeverything else. He fiddled to the green hill, and forthwith the mountain and the moss−covered rocks movedforward to hear him the better, as they had done at the sound of the Orphean lyre. He fiddled to themerry−voiced brook, to the hurrying river, and both slakened their speed and stopped their waves, and,becoming silent seemed to listen to him in an entranced rapture. Even the long−legged stork who stoodmeditatively on one leg on the thatched top of the rustic mill, gravely resolving unto himself the problem ofhis too−long existence, sent out after him a long and strident cry, screeching, \"Art thou Orpheus himself, OStenio?\" It was a period of full bliss, of a daily and almost hourly exaltation. The last words of his dying mother,whispering to him of the horrors of eternal condemnation, had left him unaffected, and the only vision herwarning evoked in him was that of Pluto. By a ready association of ideas, he saw the lord of the dark netherkingdom greeting him as he had greeted the husband of Eurydice before him. Charmed with the magicsounds of his violin, the wheel of Ixion was at a standstill once more, thus affording relief to the wretchedseducer of Juno, and giving the lie to those who claim eternity for the duration of the punishment ofcondemned sinners. He perceived Tantalus forgetting his never−ceasing thirst, and smacking his lips as hedrank in the heaven−born melody; the stone of Sisyphus becoming motionless, the Furies themselves smilingon him, and the sovereign of the gloomy regions delighted, and awarding preference to his violin over thelyre of Orpheus. Taken au serieux, mythology thus seems a decided antidote to fear, in the face of theologicalthreats, especially when strengthened with an insane and passionate love of music, with Franz, Euterpeproved always victorious in every contest, aye, even with Hell itself! But there is an end to everything, and very soon Franz had to give up uninterrupted dreaming. He had reachedthe university town where dwelt his old violin teacher, Samuel Klaus. When this antiquated musician foundthat his beloved and favourite pupil, Franz, had been left poor in purse and still poorer in earthly affections,he felt his strong attachment to the boy awaken with tenfold force. He took Franz to his heart, and forthwithadopted him as his son. The old teacher reminded people of one of those grotesque figures which look as if they had just stepped outof some mediaeval panel. And yet Klaus, with his fantastic allures of a night−goblin, had the most lovingheart, as tender as that of a woman, and the self−sacrificing nature of an old Christian martyr. When Franzhad briefly narrated to him the history of his last few years, the professor took him by the hand, and leadinghim into his study simply said: \"Stop with me, and put an end to your Bohemian life. Make yourself famous. I am old and childless and willbe your father. Let us live together and forget all save fame.\" And forthwith he offered to proceed with Franz to Paris, via several large German cities, where they wouldstop to give concerts. In a few days Klaus succeeded in making Franz forget his vagrant life and its artistic independence, andreawakened in his pupil his now dormant ambition and desire for worldly fame. Hitherto, since his mother's Nightmare TalesTHE ENSOULED VIOLIN64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"death, he had been content to receive applause only from the Gods and Goddesses who inhabited his vividfancy; now he began to crave once more for the admiration of mortals. Under the clever and careful trainingof old Klaus his remarkable talent gained in strength and powerful charm with every day, and his reputationgrew and expanded with every city and town wherein he made himself heard. His ambition was being rapidlyrealized; the presiding genii of various musical centres to whose patronage his talent was submitted soonproclaimed him the one violinist of the day, and the public declared loudly that he stood unrivalled by anyone whom they had ever heard. These laudations very soon made both master and pupil completely lose theirheads. But Paris was less ready with such appreciation. Paris makes reputations for itself, and will take none onfaith. They had been living in it for almost three years, and were still climbing with difficulty the artist'sCalvary, when an event occured which put an end even to their most modest expectations. The first arrival ofNiccolo Paganini was suddenly heralded, and threw Lutetia into a convulsion of expectation. The unparallelartist arrived, and −− all Paris fell at once at his feet. IINow it is a well−known fact that a superstition born in the dark days of mediaeval superstition, and survivingalmost to the middle of the present century, attributed all such abnormal, out−of−the−way talent as that ofPaganini to \"supernatural\" agency. Every great and marvellous artist had been accused in his day of dealingswith the devil. A few instances will suffice to refresh the reader's memory. Tartini, the great composer and violinist of the XVIIth century, was denounced as one who got his bestinspirations from the Evil One, with whom he was, it was said, in regular league. This accusation was ofcourse due to the almost magical impression he produced upon his audiences. His inspired performance onthe violin secured for him in his native country the title of \"Master of Nations.\" The Sonate du Diable, alsocalled \"Tartini's Dream\" −− as every one who has heard it will be ready to testify −− is the most weirdmelody ever heard or invented: hence, the marvellous composition has become the source of endless legends.Nor were they entirely baseless, since it was he, himself, who was shown to have originated them. Tartiniconfessed to having written it on awakening from a dream, in which he had heard his sonata performed bySatan, for his benefit, and in consequence of a bargain made with his infernal majesty. Several famous singers, even, whose exceptional voices struck the hearers with superstitious admiration, havenot escaped a like accusation. Pasta's splendid voice was attributed in her day to the fact that, three monthsbefore her birth, the diva's mother was carried during a trance to heaven, and there treated to a vocal concertof seraphs. Malibran was indebted for her voice to St. Cecilia while others said she owed it to a demon whowatched over her cradle and sung the baby to sleep. Finally Paganini −− the unrivalled performer, the meanItalian, who like Dryden's Jubal striking on the \"chorded shell\" forced the throngs that followed him toworship the divine sounds produced, and made people say that \"less than a God could not dwell within thehollow of his violin\" −− Paganini left a legend too. The almost supernatural art of the greatest violin−player that the world has ever known was often speculatedupon, never understood. The effect produced by him on his audience was literally marvellous, overpowering.The great Rossini is said to have wept like a sentimental German maiden on hearing him play for the firsttime. The Princess Elisa of Lucca, a sister of the great Napoleon, in whose service Paganini was, as directorof her private orchestra, for a long time was unable to hear him play without fainting. In women he producednervous fits and hysterics at his will; stouthearted men he drove to frenzy. He changed cowards into heroesand made the bravest soldiers feel like so many nervous school−girls. Is it to be wondered at, then, thathundreds of weird tales circulated for long years about and around the mysterious Genoese, that modernOrpheus of Europe. One of these was especially ghastly. It was rumoured, and was believed by more people Nightmare TalesII65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"than would probably like to confess it, that the strings of his violin were made of human intestines, accordingto all the rules and requirements of the Black Art.Exaggerated as this idea may seem to some, it has nothing impossible in it; and it is more than probable that itwas this legend that led to the extraordinary events which we are about to narrate. Human organs are oftenused by the Eastern Black Magicians, so−called, and it is an averred fact that some Bengali Tantrikas(reciters of tantras, or \"invocations to the demon,\" as a reverend writer has described them) use humancorpses, and certain internal and external organs pertaining to them, as powerful magical agents for badpurposes. However this may be, now that the magnetic and mesmeric potencies of hypnotism are recognized as facts bymost physicians, it may be suggested with less danger than heretofore that the extraordinary effects ofPaganini's violin−playing were not, perhaps, entirely due to his talent and genius. The wonder and awe he soeasily excited were as much caused by his external appearance, \"which had something weird and demoniacalin it,\" according to certain of his biographers, as by the inexpressible charm of his execution and hisremarkable mechanical skill. The latter is demonstrated by his perfect imitation of the flageolet, and hisperformance of long and magnificent melodies on the G string alone. In this performance, which many anartist has tried to copy without success, he remains unrivalled to this day. It is owing to this remarkable appearance of his −− termed by his friends eccentric, and by his too nervousvictims, diabolical −− that he experienced great difficulties in refuting certain ugly rumours. These werecredited far more easily in his day than they would be now. It was whispered throughout Italy, and even in hisown native town, that Paganini had murdered his wife, and, later on, a mistress, both of whom he had lovedpassionately, and both of whom he had not hesitated to sacrifice to his fiendish ambition. He had madehimself proficient in magic arts, it was asserted, and had succeeded thereby in imprisoning the souls of histwo victims in his violin −− his famous Cremona. It is maintained by the immediate friends of Ernst T. W. Hoffmann, the celebrated author of Die Elixire desTeufels, Meister Martin , and other charming and mysterious tales, that Councillor Crespel, in the Violin ofCremona, was taken from the legend about Paganini. It is as all who have read it know, the history of acelebrated violin, into which the voice and the soul of a famous diva, a woman whom Crespel had loved andkilled, had passed, and to which was added the voice of his beloved daughter, Antonia. Nor was this superstition utterly ungrounded, nor was Hoffmann to be blamed for adopting it, after he hadheard Paganini's playing. The extraordinary facility with which the artist drew out of his instrument, not onlythe most unearthly sounds, but positively human voices, justified the suspicion. Such effects might well havestartled an audience and thrown terror into many a nervous heart. Add to this the impenetrable mysteryconnected with a certain period of Paganini's youth, and the most wild tales about him must be found in ameasure justifiable, and even excusable; especially among a nation whose ancestors knew the Borgias and theMedicis of Black Art fame. IIIIn those pre−telegraphic days, newspapers were limited, and the wings of fame had a heavier flight than theyhave now. Franz had hardly heard of Paganini; and when he did, he swore he would rival, if not eclipse, the Geonesemagician. Yes, he would either become the most famous of all living violinists, or he would break hisinstrument and put an end to his life at the same time. Nightmare TalesIII66"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Old Klaus rejoiced at such a determination. He rubbed his hands in glee, and jumping about on his lame leglike a crippled satyr, he flattered and incensed his pupil, believing himself all the while to be performing asacred duty to the holy and majestic cause of art. Upon first setting foot in Paris, three years before, Franz had all but failed. Musical critics pronounced him arising star, but had all agreed that he required a few more, years' practice, before he could hope to carry hisaudiences by storm. Therefore, after a desperate study of over two years and uninterrupted preparations, theStyrian artist had finally made himself ready for his first serious appearance in the great Opera House where apublic concert before the most exacting critics of the old world was to be held; at this critical momentPaganini's arrival in the European metropolis placed an obstacle in the way of the realization of his hopes,and the old German professor wisely postponed his pupil's debut. At first he had simply smiled at the wildenthusiasm, the laudatory hymns sung about the Genoese violinist, and the almost superstitious awe withwhich his name was pronounced, But very soon Paganini's name became a burning iron in the hearts of boththe artists, and a threatening phantom in the mind of Klaus. A few days more, and they shuddered at the verymention of their great rival, whose success became with every night more unprecedented. The first series of concerts was over, but neither Klaus nor Franz had as yet had an opportunity of hearinghim and of judging for themselves. So great and so beyond their means was the charge for admission, and sosmall the hope of getting a free pass from a brother artist justly regarded as the meanest of men in monetarytransactions, that they had to wait for a chance, as did so many others. But the day came when neither masternor pupil could control their impatience any longer; so they pawned their watches, and with the proceedsbought two modest seats. Who can describe the enthusiasm, the triumphs, of this famous, and at the same time fatal night! Theaudience was frantic; men wept and women screamed and fainted; while both Klaus and Stenio, sat lookingpaler than two ghosts. At the first touch of Paganini's magic bow, both Franz and Samuel felt as if the icyhand of death had touched them. Carried away by an irresistible enthusiasm, which turned into a violent,unearthly mental torture, they dared neither look into each other's faces, nor exchange one word during thewhole performance. At midnight, while the chosen delegates of the Musical Societies and the Conservatory of Paris unhitched thehorses, and dragged the carriage of the grand artist home in triumph, the two Germans returned to theirmodest lodging, and it was a pitiful sight to see them. Mournful and desperate, they placed themselves intheir usual seats at the fire−corner, and neither for a while opened his mouth. \"Samuel!\" at last exclaimed Franz, pale as death itself. \"Samuel −− it remains for us now but to die! . . . . Doyou hear me? . . . . We are worthless! We were two madmen to have ever hoped that any one in this worldwould ever rival . . . . him!\" The name of Paganini stuck in his throat, as in utter despair he fell into his arm chair. The old professor's wrinkles suddenly became purple. His little greenish eyes gleamed phosphorescently as,bending towards his pupil, he whispered to him in hoarse and broken tones: \"Nein, nein! Thou art wrong, my Franz! I have taught thee, and thou hast learned all of the great art that asimple mortal, and a Christian by baptism, can learn from another simple mortal. Am I to blame becausethese accursed Italians, in order to reign unequalled in the domain of art, have recourse to Satan and thediabolical effects of Black Magic?\" Franz turned his eyes upon his old master. There was a sinister light burning in those glittering orbs; a lighttelling plainly, that, to secure such a power, he, too, would not scruple to sell himself, body and soul, to the Nightmare TalesIII67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Evil One. But he said not a word, and, turning his eyes from his old master's face, gazed dreamily at the dying embers. The same long−forgotten incoherent dreams, which, after seeming such realities to him in his younger days,had been given up entirely, and had gradually faded from his mind, now crowded back into it with the sameforce and vividness as of old. The grimacing shades of Ixion, Sisyphus and Tantalus resurrected and stoodbefore him, saying: \"What matters hell −− in which thou believest not. And even if hell there be, it is the hell described by the oldGreeks, not that of the modern bigots −− a locality full of conscious shadows, to whom thou canst be asecond Orpheus.\" Franz felt that he was going mad, and, turning instinctively, he looked his old master once more right in theface. Then his bloodshot eye evaded the gaze of Klaus. Whether Samuel understood the terrible state of mind of his pupil, or whether he wanted to draw him out, tomake him speak, and thus to divert his thoughts, must remain as hypothetical to the reader as it is to thewriter. Whatever may have been in his mind, the German enthusiast went on, speaking with a feignedcalmness: \"Franz, my dear boy, I tell you that the art of the accursed Italian is not natural; that it is due neither to studynor to genius. It never was acquired in the usual, natural way. You need not stare at me in that wild manner,for what I say is in the mouth of millions of people. Listen to what I now tell you, and try to understand. Youhave heard the strange tale whispered about the famous Tartini? He died one fine Sabbath night, strangled byhis familiar demon, who had taught him how to endow his violin with a human voice, by shutting up in it, bymeans of incantations, the soul of a young virgin. Paganini −− did more. In order to endow his instrumentwith the faculty of emitting human sounds, such as sobs, desparing cries,. supplications, moans of love andfury −− in short, the most heart−rending notes of the human voice −− Paganini became, the murderer notonly of his wife and his mistress, but also of a friend, who was more tenderly attached to him than any otherbeing on this earth. He then made the four chords of his magic violin out of the intestines of his last victim.This is the secret of his enchanting talent, of that overpowering melody, that combination of sounds, whichyou will never be able to master unless . . .\" The old man could not finish the sentence. He staggered back before the fiendish look of his pupil, andcovered his face with his hands. Franz was breathing heavily, and his eyes had an expression which reminded Klaus of those of a hyena. Hispallor was cadaverous. For some time he could not speak, but only gasped for breath. At last he slowlymuttered \"Are you in earnest?\" \"I am, as I hope to help you.\" \"And . . . and do you really believe that had I only the means of obtaining human intestines for strings, Icould rival Paganini?\" asked Franz, after a moment's pause, and casting down his eyes. The old German unveiled his face, and, with a strange look of determination upon it, softly answered: Nightmare TalesIII68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"\"Human intestines alone are not sufficient for our purpose; they must have belonged to some one who hadloved us well, with an unselfish, holy love. Tartini endowed his violin with the life of a virgin; but that virginhad died of unrequited love for him. The fiendish artist, had prepared beforehand a tube, in which hemanaged to catch her last breath as she expired, pronouncing his beloved name, and he then transferred thisbreath to his violin. As to Paganini, I have just told you his tale. It was with the consent of his victim, though,that he murdered him to get possession of his intestines. \"Oh, for the power of the human voice!\" Samuel went on, after a brief pause. \"What can equal the eloquence,the magic spell of the human voice? Do you think, my poor boy, I would not have taught you this great, thisfinal secret, were it not that it throws one right into the clutches of him . . . who must remain unnamed atnight?\" he added, with a sudden return to the superstitions of his youth. Franz did not answer; but with a calmness awful to behold, he left his place, took down his violin from thewall where it was hanging, and, with one powerful grasp of the chords, he tore them out and flung them intothe fire. Samuel suppressed a cry of horror. The chords were hissing upon the coals, where, among the blazing logs,they wriggled and curled like so many living snakes. \"By the witches of Thessaly and the dark arts of Circe!\" he exclaimed, with foaming mouth and his eyesburning like coals; \"by the Furies of Hell and Pluto himself, I now swear, in thy presence, O Samuel, mymaster, never to touch a violin again until I can string it with four human chords. May I be accursed for everand ever if I do!\" He fell senseless on the floor, with a deep sob, that ended like a funeral wail; old Samuellifted him up as he would have lifted a child, and carried him to his bed. Then he sallied forth in search of aphysician. IVFor several days after this painful scene Franz was very ill, ill almost beyond recovery. The physiciandeclared him to be suffering from brain fever and said that the worst was to be feared. For nine long days thepatient remained delirious; and Klaus, who was nursing him night and day with the solicitude of the tenderestmother, was horrified at the work of his own hands. For the first time since their acquaintance began, the oldteacher, owing to the wild ravings of his pupil, was able to penetrate into the darkest corners of that weird,superstitious, cold, and, at the same time, passionate nature; and −− he trembled at what he discovered. Forhe saw that which he had failed to perceive before −− Franz as he was in reality, and not as he seemed tosuperficial observers. Music was the life of the young man, and adulation was the air he breathed, withoutwhich that life became a burden; from the chords of his violin alone, Stenio, drew his life and being, but theapplause of men and even of Gods was necessary to its support. He saw unveiled before his eyes a genuine,artistic, earthly soul, with its divine counterpart totally absent, a son of the Muses, all fancy and brain poetry,but without a heart. While listening to the ravings of that delirious and unhinged fancy Klaus felt as if hewere for the first time in his long life exploring a marvellous and untravelled region, a human nature not ofthis world but of some incomplete planet. He saw all this, and shuddered. More than once he asked himselfwhether it would not be doing a kindness to his \"boy\" to let him die before he returned to consciousness. But he loved his pupil too well to dwell for long on such an idea. Franz had bewitched his truly artisticnature, and now old Klaus felt as though their two lives were inseparably linked together. That he could thusfeel was a revelation to the old man; so he decided to save Franz, even at the expense of his own old and, ashe thought, useless life. The seventh day of the illness brought on a most terrible crisis. For twenty−four hours the patient never Nightmare TalesIV69"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"closed his eyes, nor remained for a moment silent; he raved continuously during the whole time. His visionswere peculiar, and he minutely described each. Fantastic, ghastly figures kept slowly swimming out of thepenumbra of his small, dark room, in regular and uninterrupted procession, and he greeted each by name ashe might greet old acquaintances. He referred to himself as Prometheus, bound to the rock by four bandsmade of human intestines. At the foot of the Caucasian Mount the black waters of the river Styx wererunning. . . . They had deserted Arcadia, and were now endeavouring to encircle within a seven−fold embracethe rock upon which he was suffering . . . . \"Wouldst thou know the name of the Promethean rock, old man?\" he roared into his adopted father's ear. . . .\"Listen then, . . . . . its name is . . . . called Samuel Klaus . . . \"Yes, yes! . . . .\" the German murmured disconsolately. \"It is I who killed him, while seeking to console. Thenews of Paganini's magic arts struck his fancy too vividly. . . . . Oh, my poor, poor boy!\" \"Ha, ha, ha, ha!\" The patient broke into a loud and discordant laugh. \"Aye, poor old man, sayest thou? . . . .So, so, thou art of poor stuff, anyhow, and wouldst look well only when stretched upon a fine Cremonaviolin!. . .\" Klaus shuddered, but said nothing. He only bent over the poor maniac, and with a kiss upon his brow, acaress as tender and as gentle as that of a doting mother, he left the sick−room for a few instants to seek reliefin his own garret. When he returned, the ravings were following another channel. Franz was singing, trying toimitate the sounds of a violin. Toward the evening of that day, the delirium of the sick man became perfectly ghastly. He saw spirits of fireclutching at his violin. Their skeleton hands, from each finger of which grew a flaming claw, beckoned to oldSamuel . . . . They approached and surrounded the old master, and were preparing to rip him open . . . . him,\"the only man on this earth who loves me with an unselfish, holy love, and . . . whose intestines can be of anygood at all!\" he went on whispering, with glaring eyes and demon laugh . . . . By the next morning, however, the fever had disappeared, and by the end of the ninth day Stenio had left hisbed, having no recollection of his illness, and no suspicion that he had allowed Klaus to read his innerthought. Nay; had he himself any knowledge that such a horrible idea as the sacrifice of his old master to hisambition had ever entered his mind? Hardly. The only immediate result of his fatal illness was, that as, byreason of his vow, his artistic passion could find no issue, another passion awoke, which might avail to feedhis ambition and his insatiable fancy. He plunged headlong into the study of the Occult Arts, of Alchemy andof Magic. In the practice of Magic the young dreamer sought to stifle the voice of his passionate longing forhis, as he thought, for ever lost violin . . . Weeks and months passed away, and the conversation about Paganini was never resumed between the masterand the pupil. But a profound melancholy had taken possession of Franz, the two hardly exchanged a word,the violin hung mute, chordless, full of dust, in its habitual place. It was as the presence of a soulless corpsebetween them. The young man had become gloomy and sarcastic, even avoiding the mention of music. Once, as his oldprofessor, after long hesitation, took out his own violin from its dust−covered case and prepared to play,Franz gave a convulsive shudder, but said nothing. At the first notes of the bow, however, he glared like amadman, and rushing out of the house, remained for hours, wandering in the streets. Then old Samuel in histurn threw his instrument down, and locked himself up in his room till the following morning. One night as Franz sat, looking particularly pale and gloomy, old Samuel suddenly jumped from his seat, andafter hopping about the room in a magpie fashion, approached his pupil, imprinted a fond kiss upon the Nightmare TalesIV70"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"young man's brow, and squeaked at the top of his shrill voice: \"Is it not time to put an end to all this?\" . . . Whereupon, starting from his usual lethargy, Franz echoed, as in a dream: \"Yes, it is time to put an end to this.\" Upon which the two separated, and went to bed. On the following morning, when Franz awoke, he was astonished not to see his old teacher in his usual placeto greet him. But he had greatly altered during the last few months, and he at first paid no attention to hisabsence, unusual as it was. He dressed and went into the adjoining−room, a little parlour where they had theirmeals, and which separated their two bedrooms. The fire had not been lighted since the embers had died outon the previous night, and no sign was anywhere visible of the professor's busy hand in his usualhousekeeping duties. Greatly puzzled, but in no way dismayed, Franz took his usual place at the corner of thenow cold fire−place, and fell into an aimless reverie. As he stretched himself in his old armchair, raising bothhis hands to clasp them behind his head in a favourite posture of his, his hand came into contact withsomething on a shelf at his back; he knocked against a case, and brought it violently on the ground. It was old Klaus' violin−case that came down to the floor with such a sudden crash that the case opened andthe violin fell out of it, rolling to the feet of Franz. And then the chords striking against the brass fenderemitted a sound, prolonged, sad and mournful as the sigh of an unrestful soul; it seemed to fill the wholeroom, and reverberated in the head and the very heart of the young man. The effect of that brokenviolin−string was magical. \"Samuel!\" cried Stenio, with his eyes starting from their sockets, and an unknown terror suddenly takingpossession of his whole being. \"Samuel! what has happened? . . . My good, my dear old master!\" he calledout, hastening to the professor's little room, and throwing the door violently open. No one answered, all wassilent within. He staggered back, frightened at the sound of his own voice, so changed and hoarse it seemed to him at thismoment. No reply came in response to his call. Naught followed but a dead silence . . . that stillness which inthe domain of sounds, usually denotes death. In the presence of a corpse, as in the lugubrious stillness of atomb, such silence acquires a mysterious power, which strikes the sensitive soul with a nameless terror . . . .The little room was dark, and Franz hastened to open the shutters. * * * * * Samuel was lying on his bed, cold, stiff, and lifeless. . . . At the sight of the corpse of him who had loved himso well, and had been to him more than a father, Franz experienced a dreadful revulsion of feeling a terribleshock. But the ambition of the fanatical artist got the better of the despair of the man, and smothered thefeelings of the latter in a few seconds. A note bearing his own name was conspicuously placed upon a table near the corpse. With trembling hand,the violinist tore open the envelope, and read the following: MY BELOVED SON, FRANZ, When you read this, I shall have made the greatest sacrifice, that your best and only friendand teacher could have accomplished for your fame. He, who loved you most, is now but an Nightmare TalesIV71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"inanimate lump of clay. Of your old teacher there now remains but a clod of cold organicmatter.

When you shall havereplaced the chords upon your violin, and these chords a portion of my own self, under yourtouch it will acquire the power of that accursed sorcerer, all the magic voices of Paganini'sinstrument.

Two burning tears sparkled in the eyes of Franz, but they dried up instantly. Under the fiery rush ofpassionate hope and pride, the two orbs of the future magician−artist, riveted to the ghastly face of the deadman, shone like the eyes of a demon. Our pen refuses to describe that which took place on that day, after the legal inquiry was over. As anothernote, written with a view of satisfying the authorities, had been prudently provided by the loving care of theold teacher, the verdict was, \"Suicide from causes unknown\"; after this the coroner and the police retired,leaving the bereaved heir alone in the death−room, with the remains of that which had once been a livingman. * * * * * Scarcely a fortnight had elapsed from that day, ere the violin had been dusted, and four new, stout strings hadbeen stretched upon it. Franz dared not look at them. He tried to play, but the bow trembled in his hand like adagger in the grasp of a novice−brigand. He then determined not to try again, until the portentous nightshould arrive, when he should have a chance of rivalling, nay, of surpassing, Paganini. The famous violinist had meanwhile left Paris, and was giving a series of triumphant concerts at an oldFlemish town in Belgium. VOne night, as Paganini, surrounded by a crowd of admirers, was sitting in the dining−room of the hotel atwhich he was staying, a visiting card, with a few words written on it in pencil, was handed to him by a youngman with wild and staring eyes. Fixing upon the intruder a look, which few persons could bear, but receiving back a glance as calm anddetermined as his own, Paganini slightly bowed, and then dryly said: \"Sir, it shall be as you desire. Name the night. I am at your service.\" On the following morning the whole town was startled by the appearance of bills posted at the corner of Nightmare TalesV72"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"every street, and bearing the strange notice: On the night of . . . . . , at the Grand Theatre of . . . . . and for the first time, will appear beforethe public, Franz Stenio, a German violinist, arrived purposely to throw down the gauntlet to,the world−famous Paganini and to challenge him to a duel −− upon their violins. Hepurposes to compete with the great \"virtuoso\" in the execution of the most difficult of hiscompositions. The famous Paganini has accepted the challenge. Franz Stenio will play, incompetition with the unrivalled violinist, the celebrated \"Frantaisie Caprice\" of the latter,known as \"The Witches.\" The effect of the notice was magical. Paganini, who, amid his greatest triumphs, never lost sight of aprofitable speculation, doubled the usual price of admission, but still the theatre could not hold the crowdsthat flocked to secure tickets for that memorable performance. * * * * * At last the morning of the concert day dawned, and the \"duel\" was in every one's mouth. Franz Stenio, who,instead of sleeping, had passed the whole long hours of the preceding midnight in walking up and down hisroom like an encaged panther, had, toward morning, fallen on his bed from mere physical exhaustion.Gradually he passed into a death−like and dreamless slumber. At the gloomy winter dawn he awoke, butfinding it too early to rise he fell asleep again. And then he had a vivid dream −− so vivid indeed, so life−like,that from its terrible realism he felt sure that it was a vision rather than a dream. He had left his violin on a table by his bedside, locked in its case, the key of which never left him. Since hehad strung it with those terrible chords he never let it out of his sight for a moment. In accordance with hisresolution he had not touched it since his first trial, and his bow had never but once touched the humanstrings, for he had since always practised on another instrument. But now in his sleep he saw himself lookingat the locked case. Something in it was attracting his attention, and he found himself incapable of detachinghis eyes from it. Suddenly he saw the upper part of the case slowly rising, and, within the chink thusproduced, he perceived two small, phosphorescent green eyes −− eyes but too familiar to him −− fixingthemselves on his, lovingly, almost beseechingly. Then a thin, shrill voice, as if issuing from these ghastlyorbs −− the voice and orbs of Samuel Klaus himself −− resounded in Stenio's horrified ear, and he heard itsay: \"Franz, my beloved boy . . . . Franz, I cannot, no I cannot separate myself from . . . them!\" And \"they\" twanged piteously inside the case. Franz stood speechless, horror−bound. He felt his blood actually freezing, and his hair moving and standingerect on his head. \"It's but a dream, an empty dream!\" he attempted to formulate in his mind. \"I have tried my best, Franzchen . . . . I have tried my best to sever myself from these accursed strings,without pulling them to pieces. . . .\" pleaded the same shrill, familiar voice. \"Wilt thou help me to do so?\" Another twang, still more prolonged and dismal, resounded within the case, now dragged about the table inevery direction, by some interior power, like some living, wriggling thing, the twangs becoming sharper andmore jerky with every new pull. Nightmare TalesV73"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"It was not for the first time that Stenio heard those sounds. He had often remarked them before −− indeed,ever since he had used his master's viscera as a foot−stool for his own ambition. But on every occasion afeeling of creeping horror had prevented him from investigating their cause, and he had tried to assurehimself that the sounds were only a hallucination. But now he stood face to face with the terrible fact, whether in dream or in reality he knew not, nor did hecare, since the hallucination −− if hallucination it were −− was far more real and vivid than any reality. Hetried to speak, to take a step forward; but as often happens in nightmares, he could neither utter a word normove a finger . . . . . He felt hopelessly paralyzed. The pulls and jerks were becoming more desperate with each moment, and at last something inside the casesnapped violently. The vision of his Stradivarius, devoid of its magical strings, flashed before his eyes,throwing him into a cold sweat of mute and unspeakable terror. He made a superhuman effort to rid himself of the incubus that held him spell−bound. But as the lastsupplicating whisper of the invisible Presence repeated: \"Do, oh, do . . . help me to cut myself off −− \" Franz sprang to the case with one bound, like an enraged tiger defending its prey, and with one frantic effortbreaking the spell. \"Leave the violin alone, you old fiend from hell!\" he cried, in hoarse and trembling tones. He violently shut down the self−raising lid, and while firmly pressing his left hand on it, he seized with theright a piece of rosin from the table and drew on the leather−covered top the sign of the six pointed star −−the seal used by King Solomon to bottle up the rebellious djins inside their prisons. A wail, like the howl of a she−wolf moaning over her dead little ones, came out of the violin−case: \"Thou art ungrateful . . . . very ungrateful, my Franz!\" sobbed the blubbering \"spirit−voice.\" \"But I forgive . .. for I still love thee well. Yet thou canst not shut me in . . . boy. Behold!\" And instantly a greyish mist spread over and covered case and table, and rising upward formed itself into anindistinct shape. Then it began growing, and as it grew, Franz felt himself gradually enfolded in cold anddamp coils, slimy as those of a huge snake. He gave a terrible cry and awoke; but, strangely enough, not onhis bed, but near the table, just as he had dreamed, pressing the violin case desperately with both his hands. \"It was but a dream, . . . after all,\" he muttered, still terrified, but relieved of the load on his heaving breast. With a tremendous effort he composed himself, and unlocked the case to inspect the violin. He found itcovered with dust, but otherwise sound and in order, and he suddenly felt himself as cool and determined asever. Having dusted the instrument he carefully rosined the bow, tightened the strings and tuned them. Heeven went so far as to try upon it the first notes of the \"Witches\"; first cautiously and timidly, then using hisbow boldly and with full force. The sound of that loud, solitary note −− defiant as the war trumpet of a conquerer, sweet and majestic as thetouch of a seraph on his golden harp in the fancy of the faithful −− thrilled through the very soul of Franz itrevealed to him a hitherto unsuspected potency in his bow, which ran on in strains that filled the room withthe richest swell of melody, unheard by the artist until that night. Commencing in uninterrupted legato tones,his bow sang to him of sun−bright hope and beauty, of moonlit nights, when the soft and balmy stillness Nightmare TalesV74"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"endowed every blade of grass and all things animate and inanimate with a voice and a song of love. For a fewbrief moments it was a torrent of melody, the harmony of which, \"tuned to soft woe,\" was calculated to makemountains weep, had there been any in the room, and to soothe. . . . . . . even th'inexorable powers of hell, the presence of which was undeniably felt in this modest hotel room. Suddenly, the solemn legato chant,contrary to all laws of harmony, quivered, became arpeggios, and ended in shrill staccatos, like the notes of ahyena laugh. The same creeping sensation of terror, as he had before felt, came over him, and Franz threw thebow away. He had recognized the familiar laugh, and would have no more of it. Dressing, he locked thebe−devilled violin securely in its case, and taking it with him to the dining−room, determined to await quietlythe hour of trial. VIThe terrible hour of the struggle had come, and Stenio was at his post −− calm, resolute, almost smiling. The theatre was crowded to suffocation, and there was not even standing room to be got for any amount ofhard cash or favouritism. The singular challenge had reached every quarter to which the post could carry it,and gold flowed freely into Paganini's unfathomable pockets, to an extent almost satisfying even to hisinsatiate and venal soul. It was arranged that Paganini should begin. When he appeared upon the stage, the thick walls of the theatreshook to their foundations with the applause that greeted him. He began and ended his famous composition\"The Witches\" amid a storm of cheers. The shouts of public enthusiasm lasted so long that Franz began tothink his turn would never come. When, at last, Paganini, amid the roaring applause of a frantic public, wasallowed to retire behind the scenes, his eye fell upon Stenio, who was tuning his violin, and he felt amazed atthe serene calmness, the air of assurance, of the unknown German artist. When Franz approached the footlights, he was received with icy coldness. But for all that, he did not feel inthe least disconcerted. He looked very pale, but his thin white lips wore a scornful smile as response to thisdumb unwelcome. He was sure of his triumph. At the first notes of the prelude of \"The Witches\" a thrill of astonishment passed over the audience. It wasPaganini's touch, and it was something more. Some −− and they were the majority −− thought that never inhis best moments of inspiration, had the Italian artist himself, in executing that diabolical composition of his,exhibited such an extraordinary diabolical power. Under the pressure of the long muscular fingers of Franz,the chords shivered like the palpitating intestines of a disembowelled victim under the vivisector's knife.They moaned melodiously, like a dying child. The large blue eye of the artist, fixed with a satanic expressionupon the sounding−board, seemed to summon forth Orpheus himself from the infernal regions, rather thanthe musical notes supposed to be generated in the depths of the violin. Sounds seemed to transformthemselves into objective shapes, thickly and precipitately gathering as at the evocation of a mighty magician,and to be whirling around him, like a host of fantastic, infernal figures, dancing the witches' \" goat dance.\" Inthe empty depths of the shadowy background of the stage, behind the artist, a nameless phantasmagoria,produced by the concussion of unearthly vibrations, seemed to form pictures of shameless orgies, of thevoluptuous hymens of a real witches' Sabbat . . . A collective hallucination took hold of the public. Pantingfor breath, ghastly, and trickling with the icy perspiration of an inexpressible horror, they sat spell−bound,and unable to break the spell of the music by the slightest motion. They experienced all the illicit enervatingdelights of the paradise of Mahommed, that come into the disordered fancy of an opium−eating Mussulman,and felt at the same time the abject terror, the agony of one who struggles against an attack of delirium Nightmare TalesVI75"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"tremens . . . . Many ladies shrieked aloud, others fainted, and strong men gnashed their teeth, in a state ofutter helplessness. . . . Then came the finale. Thundering uninterrupted applause delayed its beginning, expanding the momentarypause to a duration of almost a quarter of an hour. The bravos were furious, almost hysterical. At last, whenafter a profound and last bow, Stenio, whose smile was as sardonic as it was triumphant, lifted his bow toattack the famous finale, his eye fell upon Paganini, who, calmly seated in the manager's box, had beenbehind none in zealous applause. The small and piercing black eyes of the Genoese artist were riveted to theStradivarius in the hands of Franz, but otherwise he seemed quite cool and unconcerned. His rival's facetroubled him for one short instant, but he regained his self−possession and, lifting once more his bow, drewthe first note. Then the public enthusiasm reached its acme, and soon knew no bounds. The listeners heard and saw indeed.The witches' voices resounded in the air, and beyond all the other voices one voice was heard −− Discordant, and unlike to human sounds It seem'd of dogs the bark, of wolves the howl; The doleful screechings of the midnight owl; The hiss of snakes, the hungry lion's roar; The sounds of billows beating on the shore; The groan of winds among the leafy wood, And burst of thunder from the rending cloud; −− 'Twas these, all these in one . . . . . . The magic bow was drawing forth its last quivering sounds −− famous among prodigious musical feats −−imitating the precipitate flight of the witches before bright dawn; of the unholy women saturated with thefumes of their nocturnal Saturnalia, when −− a strange thing came to pass on the stage. Without the slightesttransition, the notes suddenly changed. In their aerial flight of ascension and descent, their melody wasunexpectedly altered in character. The sounds became confused, scattered, disconnected . . . and then −− itseemed from the sounding−board of the violin −− came out swearing, jarring tones, like those of a streetPunch, screaming at the top of a senile voice: \"Art thou satisfied, Franz, my boy? . . . . Have not I gloriously kept my promise, eh?\" The spell was broken. Though still unable to realize the whole situation, those who heard the voice and thePunchinello−like tones, were freed, as by enchantment, from the terrible charm under which they had beenheld. Loud roars of laughter, mocking exclamations of half−anger and half−irritation were now heard fromevery corner of the vast theatre. The musicians in the orchestra, with faces still blanched from weird emotion,were now seen shaking with laughter, and the whole audience rose, like one man, from their seats, unable yetto solve the enigma; they felt, nevertheless, too disgusted, too disposed to laugh to remain one moment longerin the building. But suddenly the sea of moving heads in the stalls and the pit became once more motionless, and stoodpetrified, as though struck by lightning. What all saw was terrible enough −− the handsome though wild faceof the young artist suddenly aged, and his graceful, erect figure bent down, as though under the weight ofyears; but this was nothing to that which some of the most sensitive clearly perceived. Franz Stenio's personwas now entirely enveloped in a semi−transparent mist, cloud−like, creeping with serpentine motion, andgradually tightening round the living form, as though ready to engulf him. And there were those also whodiscerned in this tall and ominous pillar of smoke a clearly−defined figure, a form showing the unmistakableoutlines of a grotesque and grinning, but terribly awful−looking old man, whose viscera were protruding andthe ends of the intestines stretched on the violin.

An indescribable panic swept over the audience, and breaking now, for the last time, through the spell whichhad again bound them motionless, every living creature in the theatre made one mad rush towards the door. Itwas like the sudden outburst of a dam, a human torrent, roaring amid a shower of discordant notes, idioticsqueakings, prolonged and whining moans, cacophonous cries of frenzy, above which, like the detonations ofpistol shots, was heard the consecutive bursting of the four strings stretched upon the sound−board of thatbewitched violin. * * * * * When the theatre was emptied of the last man of the audience, the terrified manager rushed on the stage insearch of the unfortunate performer. He was found dead and already stiff, behind the footlights, twisted upinto the most unnatural of postures, with the \"catguts\" wound curiously round his neck and his violinshattered into a thousand fragments. . . . When it became publicly known that the unfortunate would−be rival of Niccolo Paganini had not left a centto pay for his funeral or his hotel−bill, the Genoese, his proverbial meanness notwithstanding, settled thehotel−bill and had poor Stenio buried at his own expense. He claimed, however, in exchange, the fragments of the Stradivarius −− as a memento of the strange event. Nightmare TalesVI77"}]
