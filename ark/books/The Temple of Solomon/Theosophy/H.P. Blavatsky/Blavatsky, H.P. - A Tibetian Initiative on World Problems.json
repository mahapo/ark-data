Canada FOREWORDThe publication, in 1923, of The Mahatma Letters to A.P.Sinnett has once more roused theattention of the thoughtful student to the solutions of the problems of existence offered by thewriters. Over forty years ago similar but more lively and widespread interest was evoked byMr.Sinnett's Occult World. He was then editor of The Pioneer (Allahabad) and in this smallbook he put before the English-speaking world a series of letters he had received from the two\"Brothers\" who taught and prepared Madame H.P.Blavatsky for her mission of enlightenment tothe West in the latter part of the nineteenth century.Most the letters published in the Occult World were written from 1879 onwards, when MadameBlavatsky was at work in India; and the book appeared in 1883. They were chiefly from theyounger of the two \"Brothers\", born in a Kashmiri Brahman family whose forebears hademigrated to Kashmir from Northern India in comparatively recent times. He was sent toEurope for a part of his education, studying in Germany, France, and also for a short time inEngland. Returning to India he resumed his occult studies in Tibet, and it was to him thatMadame Blavatsky finally applied when Mr. Sinnett so greatly desired to open acorrespondence with a member of the Trans-Himãlayan Brotherhood.She had met with nothing but refusals from all the other Brothers, including her own Master towhom she had first applied; but finally the Master \"K.H.\" (as he usually signs himself)consented to receive a letter from Mr.Sinnett.In the Occult World we read how the correspondence gradually became fairly constant, until atlength it had to be discontinued because Mr.Sinnett failed to comply with the necessaryconditions.This is much more clearly shown in the complete series of Letters now availablethan in the comparatively small selection originally published.There is, however, one long letter of exceptional interest and value in the Occult World whichwas not addressed to Mr.Sinnett and therefore does not appear in the Mahatma Letters. It wasA tibetan initiate on world problemshttp://www.theosophical.ca/TibetanInitiate.htm (1 of 8) [17/01/2004 13:54:21]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"written by the Master \"K.H.\" to Mr. A.O.Hume, at that time a Government Official at Simla andfounder of the Indian National Congress. As he shared for a time Mr.Sinnett's interest in thesestudies, he allowed him to include the letter in his book. In view of the nature of the subjectmatter and the light it throws on many obscure points in the history of mankind, it is nowreprinted in this series of pamphlets, and forms an illuminating commentary on some of theLetters in the complete collection.Availing of the first moments of leisure to formally answer your letter of the 17th ultimo, I willnow report the result of my conference with our chiefs upon the proposition therein contained,trying at the same time to answer all your questions.I am first to thank you on behalf of the whole section of our fraternity that is especiallyinterested in the welfare of India for an offer of help whose importance and sincerity no one candoubt. Tracing our lineage through the vicissitudes of Indian civilization from a remote past, wehave a love for our motherland so deep and passionate that it has survived even thebroadening and cosmopolitanizing (pardon me if that is not an English word) effect of ourstudies in the laws of Nature. And so I, and every other Indian patriot, feel the strongestgratitude for every kind word, or deed that is given in her behalf.Imagine, then, that since we are all convinced that the degradation of India is largely due to thesuffocation of her ancient spirituality, and that whatever helps to restore that higher standard ofthought and morals, must be a regenerating national force, every one of us would naturally andwithout urging, be disposed to push forward a society whose proposed formation is underdebate, especially if it really is meant to become a society untainted by selfish motive, andwhose object is the revival of ancient science, and tendency to rehabilitate our country in theworld's estimation. Take this for granted without further asseverations.But you know, as anyman who has read history, that patriots may burst their hearts in vain if circumstances areagainst them. Sometimes it has happened that no human power, not even the fury and force ofthe loftiest patriotism, has been able to bend an iron destiny aside from its fixed course, andnations have gone out like torches dropped into the water in the engulfing blackness of ruin.Thus, we who have the sense of our country's fall, thought not the power to lift her up at once,cannot do as we would either as to general affairs or this particular one. And with thereadiness, but not the right to meet your advances more than half-way, we are forced to saythat the idea entertained by Mr. Sinnett and yourself is impracticable in part.It is, in a word, impossible for myself or any Brother, or even an advanced neophyte, to bespecially assigned an set apart as the guiding spirit or chief of the Anglo-Indian branch. Weknow it would be a good thing to have you and a few of your colleagues regularly instructedand shown the phenomena and their rationale. For though none but you would be convinced,still it would be a decided gain to have even a few Englishmen, of first-class ability, enlisted asstudents of Asiatic Psychology. We are aware of all this, and much more; hence we do notrefuse to correspond with, and otherwise help you in various ways. But what we do refuse is, totake any other responsibility upon ourselves than this periodical correspondence andassistance with our advice, and, as occasion favours, such tangible, possibly visible, proofs, aswould satisfy you of our presence and interest. To \"guide\" you we will not consent. Howevermuch we may be able to do, yet we can promise only to give you the full measure of yourA tibetan initiate on world problemshttp://www.theosophical.ca/TibetanInitiate.htm (2 of 8) [17/01/2004 13:54:21]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"deserts. Deserve much, and we will prove honest debtors; little, and you need only expect acompensating return. This is not a mere text taken from a schoolboy's copybook, though itsounds so, but only the clumsy statement of the law of our order, and we cannot transcend it.Utterly unacquainted with Western, especially English, modes of thought and action, were weto meddle in an organization of such a kind, you would find all your fixed habits and traditionsincessantly clashing, if not with the new aspirations themselves, at least with their modes ofrealization as suggested by us. You could not get unanimous consent to go even the length youmight yourself . I have asked Mr.Sinnett to draft a plan embodying your joint ideas forsubmission to our chiefs, this seeming the shortest way to a mutual agreement. Under our\"guidance\" your branch could not live, you not being men to be guided at all in that sense.Hence the society would be a premature birth and a failure, looking as incongruous as a ParisDaumont drawn by a team of Indian yaks or camels.You ask to teach you true science - the occult aspect of the known side of Nature; and this youthink can be as easily done as asked. You do not seem to realize the tremendous difficulties inthe way of imparting even the rudiments of our science to those who have been trained in thefamiliar methods of yours. You do not see that the more you have of the one the less capableyou are of instinctively comprehending the other, for a man can only think in his worn grooves,and unless he has the courage to fill up these, and make new ones for himself, he mustperforce travel on the old lines. Allow me a few instances:In conformity with exact science you would define but one cosmic energy, and see nodifference between the energy expended by the traveller who pushes aside the bush thatobstructs his path, and the scientific experimenter who expends an equal amount of energy insetting a pendulum in motion. We do; for we know there is a world of difference between thetwo. The one uselessly dissipates and scatters force, the other concentrates and stores it. Andhere please understand that I do not refer to the relative utility of the two, as one might imagine,but only to the fact that in the one case there is but brute force flung out without anytransmutation of that brute energy into the higher potential form of spiritual dynamics, and in theother there is just that. Please do not consider me vaguely metaphysical. The idea I wish toconvey is that the result of the highest intellection in the scientifically occupied brain is theevolution of a sublimated form of spiritual energy, which, in the cosmic action, is productive ofillimitable results; while the automatically acting brain holds, or stores up in itself, only a certainquantum of brute force that is unfruitful of benefit for the individual or humanity.The human brain is an exhaustless generator of the most refined quality of cosmic force out ofthe low, brute energy of Nature; and the complete adept has made himself a centre from whichirradiate potentialities that beget correlations upon correlations through Æons of time to come.This is the key to the mystery of his being able to project into and materialize in the visibleworld the forms that his imagination has constructed out of inert cosmic matter in the invisibleworld. The adept does not create anything new, but only utilizes and manipulates materialswhich Nature has in store around him, and material which, throughout eternities, has passedthrough all the forms. He has but to choose the one he wants, and recall it into objectiveexistence. Would not this sound to one of your 'learned' biologists like a madman's dream?You say there are few branches of science with which you do not posses more or lessA tibetan initiate on world problemshttp://www.theosophical.ca/TibetanInitiate.htm (3 of 8) [17/01/2004 13:54:21]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"acquaintance, and that you believe you are doing a certain amount of good, having acquiredthe position to do this by long years of study. Doubtless you do; but will you permit me to sketchfor you still more clearly the difference between the modes of physical (called exact often out ofmere compliment) and meta-physical sciences. The latter, as you know, being incapable ofverification before mixed audiences, is classed by Mr. Tyndall with the fictions of poetry. Therealistic science of fact on the other hand is utterly prosaic.Now, for us, poor unknown philanthropists, no fact of either of these sciences is interestingexcept in the degree of its potentiality of moral results, and in the ratio of its usefulness tomankind. And what, in its proud isolation, can be more utterly indifferent to every one andeverything, or more bound to nothing but the selfish requisites for its advancement, than thismaterialistic science of fact? May I ask then....what have the laws of Faraday, Tyndall, or othersto do with philanthropy in their abstract relations with humanity, viewed as an intelligent whole?What care they for Man as an isolated atom of this great and harmonious whole, even thoughthey may sometimes be of practical use to him? Cosmic energy is something eternal andincessant; matter is indestructible; and there stand the scientific facts. Doubt them, and you arean ignoramus; deny them, a dangerous lunatic, a bigot; pretend to improve upon the theories -an impertinent charlatan.And yet even these scientific facts never suggested any proof to the world of experimentersthat Nature consciously prefers that matter should be indestructible under organic rather thaninorganic forms, and that she works slowly but incessantly towards the realization of this object- the evolution of conscious life out of inert material. Hence, their ignorance about the scatteringand concretion of cosmic energy in its metaphysical aspects, their division about Darwin'stheories, their uncertainty about the degree of conscious life in separate elements, and, as anecessity, the scornful rejection of every phenomenon outside their own stated conditions, andthe very idea of worlds of semi-intelligent if not intellectual forces at work in hidden corners ofNature.To give you another practical illustration - we see a vast difference between the two qualities oftwo equal amounts of energy expended by two men, of whom one, let us suppose, is on hisway to his daily quiet work, and another on his way to denounce a fellow-creature at the policestation, while the men of science see none; and we - not they - see a specific differencebetween the energy in the motion of the wind and that of a revolving wheel. And why? Becauseevery thought of man upon being evolved passes into the inner world, and becomes an activeentity by associating itself, coalescing we might term it, with an elemental - that is to say, withone of the semi-intelligence forces of the kingdoms. It survives as an active intelligence - acreature of the mind's begetting - for a longer or shorter period proportionate with the originalintensity of the cerebral action which generated it. Thus, a good thought is perpetuated as anactive, beneficent power, an evil one as a maleficent demon.And so man is continually peopling his current in space with a world of his own, crowded withthe offsprings of his fancies, desires, impulses, and passions; a current which re-acts upon anysensitive or nervous organization which comes in contact with it, in proportion to its dynamicintensity. The Buddhist calls this his \"Shanba'; [ A misprint for Skandha. In the Mahatma Lettersto A.P.Sinnett, page 110, footnote, K.H. says: \"I remark that in the second as well as in the firstedition of your Occult world, {this has been corrected in the electronic version of it} the sameA tibetan initiate on world problemshttp://www.theosophical.ca/TibetanInitiate.htm (4 of 8) [17/01/2004 13:54:21]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"misprint appears, and that the word Skandha is spelt Shandha - on page 130. As it now standsI am made to express myself in a very original way for supposed Adept.\" Mr. Sinnett did notcorrect the misprint in the third edition, where the page is 90, not 130. Editor] the Hindu gives itthe name of 'Karma' The adept evolves these shapes consciously; other men throw them offunconsciously. The adept, to be successful and preserve his power, must dwell in solitude, andmore or less within his own soul. Still less does exact science perceive that while the buildingant, the busy bee, the nidifacient bird, accumulates each in its own humble way as muchcosmic energy in its potential form as a Haydn, a Plato, or a ploughman turning his furrow, intheirs; the hunter who kills game for his pleasure or profit, or the positivist who applies hisintellect to proving that + x + = -, are wasting and scattering energy no less than the tiger whichsprings upon its prey. They all rob Nature instead of enriching her, and will all, in the degree oftheir intelligence, find themselves accountable.Exact experimental science has nothing to do with morality, virtue, philanthropy - therefore, canmake no claim upon our help until it blends itself with metaphysics. Being but a coldclassification of facts outside man, and existing before and after him, her domain of usefulnessceases for us at the outer boundary of these facts; and whatever the inferences and results forhumanity from the materials acquired by her method, she little cares. Therefore, as our spherelies entirely outside hers - as far as the path of Uranus is outside the 'Earth's - we distinctlyrefuse to be broken on any wheel of her construction. Heat is but a mode of motion to her, andmotion develops heat, but why the mechanical motion of the revolving wheel should bemetaphysically of a higher value than the heat into which it is gradually transformed she has yetto discover.The philosophical and transcendental (hence absurd) notion of the mediæval Theosophists thatthe final progress of human labour, aided by the incessant discoveries of man, must one dayculminate in a process which, in imitation of the Sun's energy - in its capacity as a direct motor -shall result in the evolution of nutritious food out of inorganic matter, is unthinkable for men ofscience. Were the sun, the great nourishing father of our planetary system, to hatch granitechickens out of a boulder 'under test conditions' tomorrow, they (the men of science) wouldaccept it as a scientific fact without wasting a regret that the fowls were not alive so as to feedthe hungry and the starving. But let a shaberon cross the Himalayas in a time of famine andmultiply sacks of rice for the perishing multitudes - as he could - and your magistrates andcollectors would probably lodge him in jail to make him confess what granary he had robbed.This is exact science and your realistic world. And though, as you say, you are impressed bythe vast extent of the world's ignorance on every subject, which you pertinently designate as a\"few palpable facts collected and roughly generalized, and a technical jargon invented to hideman's ignorance of all that lies behind these facts,\" and though you speak of your faith in theinfinite possibilities of Nature, yet you are content to spend your life in a work which aids onlythat same exact science ....Of your several questions we will first discuss, if you please, the one relating to the presumedfailure of the \"Fraternity\" to \"leave any mark upon the history of the world.\" They ought, youthink, to have been able, with their extraordinary advantages,, to have \"gathered into theirschools a considerable portion of the more enlightened minds of every race.\" How do you knowthey have made no such mark?

The prime condition of their success was that they shouldnever be supervised or obstructed. What they have done they know; all that those outside theircircle could perceive was results, the causes of which were masked from view. To account forthese results, men have, in different ages, invented theories of the interposition of gods, specialprovidences, fates, the benign or hostile influence of the stars.There never was a time within or before the so-called historical period when our predecessorswere not moulding events and 'making history', the facts of which were subsequently andinvariably distorted by historians to suit contemporary prejudices. Are you quite sure that thevisible heroic figures in the successive dramas were not often but their puppets? We neverpretended to be able to draw nations in the mass to this or that crisis in spite of the general driftof the world's cosmic relations. The cycles must run their rounds. Periods of mental and morallight and darkness succeed each other as day does night. The major and minor yugas must beaccomplished according to the established order of things. And we, borne along on the mightytide, can only modify and direct some of its minor currents. If we had the powers of theimaginary Personal God, and the universal and immutable laws were but toys to play with,then, indeed, might we have created conditions that would have turned this earth into anarcadia for lofty souls. But have to deal with an immutable law, being ourselves its creatures,we have had to do what we could, and rest thankful. There have been times when \"aconsiderable portion of enlightened minds\" were taught in our schools. Such times there werein India, Persia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. But, as I remarked in a letter to Mr. Sinnett, theadept is the efflorescence of his age, and comparatively few ever appear in a single century.Earth is the battle-ground of moral no less than of physical forces, and the boisterousness ofanimal passion, under the stimulus of the rude energies of the lower group of etheric agents,always tends to quench spirituality. What else could one expect of men so nearly related to thelower kingdom from which they evolved? True also, our numbers are just now diminishing, butthis is because, as I have said, we are of the human race, subject to its cyclic-impulse, andpowerless to turn that back upon itself. Can you turn the Gunga or the Brahmaputra back to itssources; can you even dam it so that its piled-up waters will not overflow the banks? No; butyou may draw the stream partly into canals, and utilize its hydraulic power for the good ofmankind. So we, who cannot stop the world from going in its destined direction, are yet able todivert some part of its energy into useful channels. Think of us as demi-gods, and myexplanation will not satisfy you; view us as simple men - perhaps a little wiser as the result ofspecial study - and it ought to answer your objection.\"What good\" you say, \"is to be attained for my fellows and myself (the two are inseparable) bythese occult sciences?\" When the natives see that an interest is taken by the English, and evenby some high officials in India, in their ancestral science and philosophies, they will themselvestake openly to their study. And when they come to realize that the old 'divine' phenomena werenot miracles, but scientific effects, superstition will abate. Thus, the greatest evil that nowoppresses and retards the revival of Indian civilization will in time disappear. The presenttendency of education is to make them materialistic and root out spirituality. With a properunderstanding of what their ancestors meant by their writings and teachings, education wouldbecome a blessing, whereas now it is often a curse.A tibetan initiate on world problemshttp://www.theosophical.ca/TibetanInitiate.htm (6 of 8) [17/01/2004 13:54:21]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"At present the non-educated, as much as the learned natives, regard the English as tooprejudiced, because of their Christian religion and modern science, to care to understand themor their traditions. They mutually hate and mistrust each other. This changed attitude towardsthe older philosophy, would influence the native princes and wealthy men to endow normalschools for the education of pundits; and old MSS., hitherto buried out of reach of theEuropeans, would again come to light, and with them the key to much of that which was hiddenfor ages from the popular understanding, for which your sceptical Sanscritists do not care,which your religious missionaries do not dare to understand. Science would gain much,humanity everything. Under the stimulus of the Anglo-Indian Theosophical Society,we might intime see another golden age of Sanscrit literature.If we look at Ceylon we shall see the most scholarly priests combining, under the lead of theTheosophical Society, in a new exegesis of Buddhistic philosophy; and at Galle, on the 15th ofSeptember, a secular Theosophical School for the teaching of Singhalese youth, opened withan attendance of over three hundred scholars; an example about to be imitated at three otherpoints in that island. If the Theosophical Society, \"as at present constituted,\" has indeed no\"real vitality\", and yet in its modest way has done so much practical good, how much greaterresults might not be anticipated from a body organized upon the better plan you could suggest?The same causes that are materializing the Hindu mind are equally affecting all Westernthought. Education enthrones scepticism, but imprisons spirituality. You can do immense goodby helping to give the Western nations a secure basis upon which to reconstruct their crumbingfaith. And what they need is the evidence that Asiatic psychology alone supplies. Give this, andyou will confer happiness of mind on thousands. The era of blind faith is gone; that of inquiry ishere. Inquiry that only unmasks error, without discovering anything upon which the soul canbuild, will but make iconoclasts. Iconoclasm, from its very destructiveness, can give nothing; itcan only raze. But man cannot rest satisfied with bare negation. Agnosticism is but a temporaryhalt. This is the moment to guide the recurrent impulse which must come, and which will pushthe age towards extreme atheism, or drag it back to extreme sacerdotalism, if it is not led to theprimitive soul-satisfying philosophy of the Aryans.He who observes what is going on today, on the one hand among the Catholics, who arebreeding miracles as fast as the white ants do their young, on the other among the freethinkers,who are converting, by masses, into Agnostics - will see the drift of things. The age is revellingin a debauch of phenomena. The same marvels that the spiritualist quote in opposition to thedogmas of eternal perdition and atonement, the Catholics swarm to witness as proof of theirfaith in miracles. The sceptics make game of both. All are blind, and there is no one to leadthem. You and your colleagues may help to furnish the materials for a needed universalreligious philosophy; one impregnable to scientific assault, because itself the finality of absolutescience, and a religion that is indeed worthy of the name since it includes the relations of manphysical to man psychical, and of the two to all that is above and below them. Is not this worth aslight sacrifice? And if, after reflection, you should decide to enter this new career, let it beknown that your society is no miracle-mongering or banqueting club, nor specially given to thestudy of phenomenalism. Its chief aim is to extirpate current superstitions and scepticism, andfrom long-sealed ancient fountains to draw the proof that man may shape his own futuredestiny, and know for a certainty that he can life hereafter, if he only wills, and that all'phenomena' are but manifestations of natural law, to try to comprehend which is the duty ofA tibetan initiate on world problemshttp://www.theosophical.ca/TibetanInitiate.htm (7 of 8) [17/01/2004 13:54:21]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"every intelligent being.
