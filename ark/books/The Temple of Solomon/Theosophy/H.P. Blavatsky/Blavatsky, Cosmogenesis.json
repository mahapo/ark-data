Even the two volumes now issued do not complete thescheme, and these do not treat exhaustively of the subjects dealt with in them. A large quantity of material has already beenprepared, dealing with the history of occultism as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of the Aryan Race, and showing thebearing of occult philosophy upon the conduct of life, as it is and as it ought to be. Should the present volumes meet with afavourable reception, no effort will be spared to carry out the scheme of the work in its entirety. The third volume is entirely ready; thefourth almost so.This scheme, it must be added, was not in contemplation when the preparation of the work was first announced. As originallyannounced, it was intended that the \"Secret Doctrine\" should be an amended and enlarged version of \"Isis Unveiled.\" It was,however, soon found that the explanations which could be added to those already put before the world in the last-named and otherworks dealing with esoteric science, were such as to require a different method of treatment: and consequently the present volumes donot contain, in all, twenty pages extracted from \"Isis Unveiled.\"The author does not feel it necessary to ask the indulgence of her readers and critics for the many defects of literary style, and theimperfect English which may be found in these pages. She is a foreigner, and her knowledge of the language was acquired late inlife. The English tongue is employed because it offers the most widely-diffused medium for conveying the truths which it had becomeher duty to place before the world.These truths are in no sense put forward as a revelation; nor does the author claim the position of a revealer of mystic lore, now madepublic for the first time in the world's history. For what is contained in this work is to be found scattered throughout thousands ofvolumes embodying the scriptures of the great Asiatic and early European religions, hidden under glyph and symbol, and hitherto leftunnoticed because of this veil. What is now attempted is to gather the oldest tenets together and to make of them one harmoniousand unbroken whole. The sole advantage which the writer has over her predecessors, is that she need not resort to personalspeculations and theories. For this work is a partial statement of what she herself has been taught by more advanced students,supplemented, in a few details only, by the results of her------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] viiiown study and observation. The publication of many of the facts herein stated has been rendered necessary by the wild and fancifulspeculations in which many Theosophists and students of mysticism have indulged, during the last few years, in their endeavour to, asthey imagined, work out a complete system of thought from the few facts previously communicated to them.It is needless to explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine in its entirety, but a select number of fragments of its fundamentaltenets, special attention being paid to some facts which have been seized upon by various writers, and distorted out of allresemblance to the truth.But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings, however fragmentary and incomplete, contained in thesevolumes, belong neither to the Hindu, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor the Egyptian religion, neither to Buddhism, Islam, Judaismnor Christianity exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is the essence of all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the various religiousschemes are now made to merge back into their original element, out of which every mystery and dogma has grown, developed, andbecome materialised.It is more than probable that the book will be regarded by a large section of the public as a romance of the wildest kind; for who hasever even heard of the book of Dzyan?The writer, therefore, is fully prepared to take all the responsibility for what is contained in this work, and even to face the charge ofhaving invented the whole of it. That it has many shortcomings she is fully aware; all that she claims for it is that, romantic as it may"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"seem to many, its logical coherence and consistency entitle this new Genesis to rank, at any rate, on a level with the \"workinghypotheses\" so freely accepted by modern science. Further, it claims consideration, not by reason of any appeal to dogmaticauthority, but because it closely adheres to Nature, and follows the laws of uniformity and analogy.The aim of this work may be thus stated: to show that Nature is not \"a fortuitous concurrence of atoms,\" and to assign to man hisrightful place in the scheme of the Universe; to rescue from degradation the archaic truths which are the basis of all religions; and touncover, to some extent, the fundamental unity from which they all spring; finally, to show that the occult side of Nature has neverbeen approached by the Science of modern civilization.If this is in any degree accomplished, the writer is content. It is written in the service of humanity, and by humanity and the futuregenerations it must be judged. Its author recognises no inferior court of appeal. Abuse she is accustomed to; calumny she is dailyacquainted with; at slander she smiles in silent contempt.De minimis non curat lex.H.P.B.London, October, 1888.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page ix]]TABLE OF CONTENTS.-------PAGE.INTRODUCTION ... xvii.The Need of such a Book ... xix.The Antiquity of Documents and MSS. ... xxiii.What the Book is intended to do ... xxviii.-------VOLUME FIRST.COSMOGENESIS.PROEM ... 1The Oldest MSS. in the world and its Symbolism ... 2The One Life, Active and Passive ... 4The Secret Doctrine -- Pantheism -- Atheism ... 6\"Space\" in all Religions and in Occultism ... 9Seven Cosmic Elements -- Seven Races of Mankind ... 12The Three Postulates of the Secret Doctrine ... 14Description of the Stanzas from the Book of Dzyan ... 20-------BOOK I. -- PART I.COSMIC EVOLUTION.SEVEN STANZAS FROM THE BOOK OF DZYAN ... 27-------STANZA I. -- THE NIGHT OF THE UNIVERSE... 35The Seven Eternities ... 36\"Time\" ... 37The Universal Mind and the Dhyan Chohans ... 38Nidana and Maya: The Causes of Misery ... 39The Great Breath ... 43Being and Non-Being ... 45The Eye of Dangma ... 47"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Alaya, the Universal Soul ... 49------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] x CONTENTS.PAGE.STANZA II. -- THE IDEA OF DIFFERENTIATION ... 53The Absolute knows Itself not ... 55The Germ of Life was not yet ... 57The Universe was still concealed in the Divine Thought ... 61-------STANZA III. -- THE AWAKENING OF KOSMOS ... 62The Great Vibration ... 63Nature's Symbols ... 65The Power of Numbers ... 67The Logoi and the Dragon ... 73The Astral Light ... 75Primeval Radiations from Unity ... 79The Web of Being ... 83Conscious Electricity: Fohat ... 85-------STANZA IV. -- THE SEPTENARY HIERARCHIES ... 86The Sons of the Fire ... 86The Vehicle of the Universe -- the Dhyan Chohans ... 89The Army of the Voice ... 93Speech and Mind ... 95The Ogdoad and the Heptad ... 99The Stellar \"Sons of Light\" ... 103-------STANZA V. -- FOHAT: THE CHILD OF THE SEPTENARY HIERARCHIES ... 106The Fiery Whirlwind and the Primordial Seven ... 106They Produce Fohat ... 108The Correlation of the \"Gods\" ... 113Evolution of the \"Principles\" of Nature ... 119The Mystery of the Fire ... 121The Secret of the Elements ... 123The Square of the Tabernacle ... 125The Planetary Spirits and the Lipika ... 129The Ring \"Pass Not\" ... 130The Sidereal Book of Life ... 131The Soul's Pilgrimage and its \"Rest\" ... 134-------STANZA VI. -- OUR WORLD, ITS GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ... 136The Logos ... 136Mystery of the Female Logos ... 137------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xi CONTENTS.PAGE.The Seven Layu Centres ... 138The \"Elementary Germs\" ... 139The Evolution of the Elements ... 140"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Building of the Worlds ... 145A Neutral Centre ... 147\"Dead\" Planets -- The Moon ... 149-------THEOSOPHICAL MISCONCEPTIONS ... 152The Planetary Divisions and the Human Principles ... 153The Moon ... 155Transmigrations of the Ego ... 159The Septenary Chain ... 161Relation of the other Planets to the Earth ... 163-------EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THE GLOBES AND THE MONADS ... 170The Lunar Chain and the Earth Chain ... 172The Earth, the Child of the Moon ... 173Classification of the Monads ... 175The Monad Defined ... 177The Lunar Monads -- the Pitris ... 179A Triple Evolution in Nature ... 181-------STANZA VI. -- CONTINUED ... 191\"Creation\" in the Fourth Round ... 191The \"Curse,\" \"Sin,\" and \"War\" ... 193The Struggle for Life and the Birth of the Worlds ... 202The Adepts and the Sacred Island ... 207-------STANZA VII. -- THE PARENTS OF MAN ON EARTH ... 213Divisions of the Hierarchies ... 214Correlations of Beings ... 223What incarnates in Animal Man ... 233Formation of Man: the Thinker ... 238Occult and Kabalistic Pneumatics ... 243Akasa and Ether ... 257The Invisible \"Lives\" ... 259Occult Vital Chemistry and Bacteriology ... 261------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xii CONTENTS.PAGE.The Watcher and his Shadow ... 265Earth peopled by the Shadows of the Gods ... 267-------SUMMING UP ... 269The pith and marrow of the Secret Doctrine ... 273Hermes in Christian Garb ... 285Some Occult Aphorisms ... 289The Seven Powers of Nature ... 293---------------------BOOK I. -- PART II.THE EVOLUTION OF SYMBOLISM IN ITS APPROXIMATE ORDER."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"§§I.

The human mind can hardly remain entirely free from bias, and decisive opinions are often formedbefore a thorough examination of a subject from all its aspects has been made. This is said with reference to the prevailing doublemistake (a) of limiting Theosophy to Buddhism: and (b) of confounding the tenets of the religious philosophy preached by Gautama,the Buddha, with the doctrines broadly outlined in \"Esoteric Buddhism.\" Any thing more erroneous than this could be hardlyimagined. It has enabled our enemies to find an effective weapon against theosophy; because, as an eminent Pali scholar verypointedly expressed it, there was in the volume named \"neither esotericism nor Buddhism.\" The esoteric truths, presented in Mr.Sinnett's work, had ceased to be esoteric from the moment they were made public; nor did it contain the religion of Buddha, butsimply a few tenets from a hitherto hidden teaching which are now supplemented by many more, enlarged and explained in thepresent volumes. But even the latter, though giving out many fundamental tenets from the SECRET DOCTRINE of the East, raise buta small corner of the dark veil. For no one, not even the greatest living adept, would be permitted to, or could -- even if he would --give out promiscuously, to a mocking, unbelieving world, that which has been so effectually concealed from it for long aeons andages.\"Esoteric Buddhism\" was an excellent work with a very unfortunate------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xviii INTRODUCTORY.title, though it meant no more than does the title of this work, the \"SECRET DOCTRINE.\" It proved unfortunate, because people arealways in the habit of judging things by their appearance, rather than their meaning; and because the error has now become souniversal, that even most of the Fellows of the Theosophical Society have fallen victims to the same misconception. From the first,however, protests were raised by Brahmins and others against the title; and, in justice to myself, I must add that \"Esoteric Buddhism\"was presented to me as a completed volume, and that I was entirely unaware of the manner in which the author intended to spell theword \"Budh-ism.\"This has to be laid directly at the door of those who, having been the first to bring the subject under public notice, neglected to pointout the difference between \"Buddhism\" -- the religious system of ethics preached by the Lord Gautama, and named after his title ofBuddha, \"the Enlightened\" -- and Budha, \"Wisdom,\" or knowledge (Vidya), the faculty of cognizing, from the Sanskrit root \"Budh,\" toknow. We theosophists of India are ourselves the real culprits, although, at the time, we did our best to correct the mistake. (SeeTheosophist, June, 1883.) To avoid this deplorable misnomer was easy; the spelling of the word had only to be altered, and bycommon consent both pronounced and written \"Budhism,\" instead of \"Buddhism.\" Nor is the latter term correctly spelt andpronounced, as it ought to be called, in English, Buddhaism, and its votaries \"Buddhaists.\"This explanation is absolutely necessary at the beginning of a work like this one. The \"Wisdom Religion\" is the inheritance of all thenations, the world over, though the statement was made in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" (Preface to the original Edition) that \"two years ago(i.e. 1883), neither I nor any other European living, knew the alphabet of the Science, here for the first time put into a scientificshape,\" etc. This error must have crept in through inadvertence. For the present writer knew all that which is \"divulged\" in \"EsotericBuddhism\" -- and much more -- many years before it became her duty (in 1880) to impart a small portion of the Secret Doctrine to twoEuropean gentlemen, one of whom was the author of \"Esoteric Buddhism\"; and surely the present writer has the undoubted, though toher, rather equivocal, privilege of being a European, by birth and education. Moreover, a considerable part of the philosophy------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xix INTRODUCTORY.expounded by Mr. Sinnett was taught in America, even before Isis Unveiled was published, to two Europeans and to my colleague,Colonel H. S. Olcott. Of the three teachers the latter gentleman has had, the first was a Hungarian Initiate, the second an Egyptian,the third a Hindu. As permitted, Colonel Olcott has given out some of this teaching in various ways; if the other two have not, it hasbeen simply because they were not allowed: their time for public work having not yet come. But for others it has, and the appearance"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of Mr. Sinnett's several interesting books is a visible proof of the fact. It is above everything important to keep in mind that notheosophical book acquires the least additional value from pretended authority.In etymology Adi, and Adhi Budha, the one (or the First) and \"Supreme Wisdom\" is a term used by Aryasanga in his Secret treatises,and now by all the mystic Northern Buddhists. It is a Sanskrit term, and an appellation given by the earliest Aryans to the Unknowndeity; the word \"Brahma\" not being found in the Vedas and the early works. It means the absolute Wisdom, and \"Adi-bhuta\" istranslated \"the primeval uncreated cause of all\" by Fitzedward Hall. AEons of untold duration must have elapsed, before the epithetof Buddha was so humanized, so to speak, as to allow of the term being applied to mortals and finally appropriated to one whoseunparalleled virtues and knowledge caused him to receive the title of the \"Buddha of Wisdom unmoved.\" Bodha means the innatepossession of divine intellect or \"understanding\"; \"Buddha,\" the acquirement of it by personal efforts and merit; while Buddhi is thefaculty of cognizing the channel through which divine knowledge reaches the \"Ego,\" the discernment of good and evil, \"divineconscience\" also; and \"Spiritual Soul,\" which is the vehicle of Atma. \"When Buddhi absorbs our EGOtism (destroys it) with all itsVikaras, Avalokiteshvara becomes manifested to us, and Nirvana, or Mukti, is reached,\" \"Mukti\" being the same as Nirvana, i.e.,freedom from the trammels of \"Maya\" or illusion. \"Bodhi\" is likewise the name of a particular state of trance condition, calledSamadhi, during which the subject reaches the culmination of spiritual knowledge.Unwise are those who, in their blind and, in our age, untimely hatred of Buddhism, and, by re-action, of \"Budhism,\" deny its esotericteachings (which are those also of the Brahmins), simply because the name------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xx INTRODUCTORY.suggests what to them, as Monotheists, are noxious doctrines. Unwise is the correct term to use in their case. For the Esotericphilosophy is alone calculated to withstand, in this age of crass and illogical materialism, the repeated attacks on all and everythingman holds most dear and sacred, in his inner spiritual life. The true philosopher, the student of the Esoteric Wisdom, entirely losessight of personalities, dogmatic beliefs and special religions. Moreover, Esoteric philosophy reconciles all religions, strips every one ofits outward, human garments, and shows the root of each to be identical with that of every other great religion. It proves the necessityof an absolute Divine Principle in nature. It denies Deity no more than it does the Sun. Esoteric philosophy has never rejected God inNature, nor Deity as the absolute and abstract Ens. It only refuses to accept any of the gods of the so-called monotheistic religions,gods created by man in his own image and likeness, a blasphemous and sorry caricature of the Ever Unknowable. Furthermore, therecords we mean to place before the reader embrace the esoteric tenets of the whole world since the beginning of our humanity, andBuddhistic occultism occupies therein only its legitimate place, and no more. Indeed, the secret portions of the \"Dan\" or Jan-na\"*(\"Dhyan\") of Gautama's metaphysics -- grand as they appear to one unacquainted with the tenets of the Wisdom Religion of antiquity -- are but a very small portion of the whole. The Hindu Reformer limited his public teachings to the purely moral and physiologicalaspect of the Wisdom Religion, to Ethics and MAN alone. Things \"unseen and incorporeal,\" the mystery of Being outside ourterrestrial sphere, the great Teacher left entirely untouched in his public lectures, reserving the hidden Truths for a select circle of hisArhats. The latter received their Initiation at the famous Saptaparna cave (the Sattapanni of Mahavansa) near Mount Baibhar (theWebhara of the Pali MSS.). This cave was in Rajagriha, the ancient capital of Mogadha, and was the Cheta cave of Fa-hian, asrightly suspected by some archaeologists.**Time and human imagination made short work of the purity and philo-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Dan, now become in modern Chinese and Tibetan phonetics ch'an, is the general term for the esoteric schools, and their literature.In the old books, the word Janna is defined as \"to reform one's self by meditation and knowledge,\" a second inner birth. Hence Dzan,Djan phonetically, the \"Book of Dzyan.\"** Mr. Beglor, the chief engineer at Buddhagaya, and a distinguished archaeologist, was the first, we believe, to discover it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxi INTRODUCTORY.sophy of these teachings, once that they were transplanted from the secret and sacred circle of the Arhats, during the course of theirwork of proselytism, into a soil less prepared for metaphysical conceptions than India; i.e., once they were transferred into China,Japan, Siam, and Burmah. How the pristine purity of these grand revelations was dealt with may be seen in studying some of the so-called \"esoteric\" Buddhist schools of antiquity in their modern garb, not only in China and other Buddhist countries in general, buteven in not a few schools in Thibet, left to the care of uninitiated Lamas and Mongolian innovators.Thus the reader is asked to bear in mind the very important difference between orthodox Buddhism -- i.e., the public teachings ofGautama the Buddha, and his esoteric Budhism. His Secret Doctrine, however, differed in no wise from that of the initiated Brahminsof his day. The Buddha was a child of the Aryan soil; a born Hindu, a Kshatrya and a disciple of the \"twice born\" (the initiatedBrahmins) or Dwijas. His teachings, therefore, could not be different from their doctrines, for the whole Buddhist reform merelyconsisted in giving out a portion of that which had been kept secret from every man outside of the \"enchanted\" circle of Temple-Initiates and ascetics. Unable to teach all that had been imparted to him -- owing to his pledges -- though he taught a philosophybuilt upon the ground-work of the true esoteric knowledge, the Buddha gave to the world only its outward material body and kept itssoul for his Elect. (See also Volume II.) Many Chinese scholars among Orientalists have heard of the \"Soul Doctrine.\" None seem tohave understood its real meaning and importance."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"That doctrine was preserved secretly -- too secretly, perhaps -- within the sanctuary. The mystery that shrouded its chief dogma andaspirations -- Nirvana -- has so tried and irritated the curiosity of those scholars who have studied it, that, unable to solve it logicallyand satisfactorily by untying the Gordian knot, they cut it through, by declaring that Nirvana meant absolute annihilation.Toward the end of the first quarter of this century, a distinct class of literature appeared in the world, which became with every yearmore defined in its tendency. Being based, soi-disant, on the scholarly researches of Sanskritists and Orientalists in general, it washeld scientific. Hindu, Egyptian, and other ancient religions, myths, and emblems were made to yield anything the symbologistwanted them to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxii INTRODUCTORY.yield, thus often giving out the rude outward form in place of the inner meaning. Works, most remarkable for their ingeniousdeductions and speculations, in circulo vicioso, foregone conclusions generally changing places with premisses as in the syllogisms ofmore than one Sanskrit and Pali scholar, appeared rapidly in succession, over-flooding the libraries with dissertations rather on phallicand sexual worship than on real symbology, and each contradicting the other.This is the true reason, perhaps, why the outline of a few fundamental truths from the Secret Doctrine of the Archaic ages is nowpermitted to see the light, after long millenniums of the most profound silence and secrecy. I say \"a few truths,\" advisedly, becausethat which must remain unsaid could not be contained in a hundred such volumes, nor could it be imparted to the present generationof Sadducees. But, even the little that is now given is better than complete silence upon those vital truths. The world of to-day, in itsmad career towards the unknown -- which it is too ready to confound with the unknowable, whenever the problem eludes the grasp ofthe physicist -- is rapidly progressing on the reverse, material plane of spirituality. It has now become a vast arena -- a true valley ofdiscord and of eternal strife -- a necropolis, wherein lie buried the highest and the most holy aspirations of our Spirit-Soul. That soulbecomes with every new generation more paralyzed and atrophied. The \"amiable infidels and accomplished profligates\" of Society,spoken of by Greeley, care little for the revival of the dead sciences of the past; but there is a fair minority of earnest students who areentitled to learn the few truths that may be given to them now; and now much more than ten years ago, when \"Isis Unveiled,\" or eventhe later attempts to explain the mysteries of esoteric science, were published.One of the greatest, and, withal, the most serious objection to the correctness and reliability of the whole work will be the preliminarySTANZAS: \"How can the statements contained in them be verified?\" True, if a great portion of the Sanskrit, Chinese, and Mongolianworks quoted in the present volumes are known to some Orientalists, the chief work -- that one from which the Stanzas are given -- isnot in the possession of European Libraries. The Book of Dzyan (or \"Dzan\") is utterly unknown to our Philologists, or at any rate wasnever heard of by them under its present name.

The main body of the Doctrines given is found scattered throughout hundreds and thousands ofSanskrit MSS., some already translated -- disfigured in their interpretations, as usual, -- others still awaiting their turn. Every scholar,therefore, has an opportunity of verifying the statements herein made, and of checking most of the quotations. A few new facts (new tothe profane Orientalist, only) and passages quoted from the Commentaries will be found difficult to trace. Several of the teachings,also, have hitherto been transmitted orally: yet even those are in every instance hinted at in the almost countless volumes ofBrahminical, Chinese and Tibetan temple-literature.However it may be, and whatsoever is in store for the writer through malevolent criticism, one fact is quite certain. The members ofseveral esoteric schools -- the seat of which is beyond the Himalayas, and whose ramifications may be found in China, Japan, India,Tibet, and even in Syria, besides South America -- claim to have in their possession the sum total of sacred and philosophical works inMSS. and type: all the works, in fact, that have ever been written, in whatever language or characters, since the art of writing began;from the ideographic hieroglyphs down to the alphabet of Cadmus and the Devanagari.It has been claimed in all ages that ever since the destruction of the Alexandrian Library (see Isis Unveiled, Vol. II., p. 27), every workof a character that might have led the profane to the ultimate discovery and comprehension of some of the mysteries of the SecretScience, was, owing to the combined efforts of the members of the Brotherhoods, diligently searched for. It is added, moreover, bythose who know, that once found, save three copies left and stored safely away, such works were all destroyed. In India, the last of theprecious manuscripts were secured and hidden during the reign of the Emperor Akbar.*It is maintained, furthermore, that every sacred book of that kind, whose text was not sufficiently veiled in symbolism, or which had any[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Prof. Max Muller shows that no bribes or threats of Akbar could extort from the Brahmans the original text of the Veda; and boaststhat European Orientalists have it (Lecture on the \"Science of Religion,\" p. 23).

During Akbar's reign, some fanatical courtiers, displeased at theEmperor's sinful prying into the religions of the infidels, themselves helped the Brahmans to conceal their MSS. Such was Badaoni,who had an undisguised horror for Akbar's mania for idolatrous religions.*Moreover in all the large and wealthy lamasaries, there are subterranean crypts and cave-libraries, cut in the rock, whenever thegonpa and the lhakhang are situated in the mountains. Beyond the Western Tsay-dam, in the solitary passes of Kuen-lun** there areseveral such hiding places. Along the ridge of Altyn-Toga, whose soil no European foot has ever trodden so far, there exists a certainhamlet, lost in a deep gorge. It is a small cluster of houses, a hamlet rather than a monastery, with a poor-looking temple in it, withone old lama, a hermit, living near by to watch it. Pilgrims say that the subterranean galleries and halls under it contain a collectionof books, the number of which, according to the accounts given, is too large to find room even in the British Museum.***All this is very likely to provoke a smile of doubt. But then, before[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Badaoni wrote in his Muntakhab at Tawarikh: \"His Majesty relished inquiries into the sects of these infidels (who cannot be counted,so numerous they are, and who have no end of revealed books) . . . As they (the Sramana and Brahmins) surpass other learned men intheir treatises on morals, on physical and religious sciences, and reach a high degree in their knowledge of the future, in spiritualpower, and human perfection, they brought proofs based on reason and testimony, and inculcated their doctrines so firmly that noman could now raise a doubt in his Majesty even if mountains were to crumble to dust, or the heavens were to tear asunder.\" Thiswork \"was kept secret, and was not published till the reign of Jahangir.\" (Ain i Akbari, translated by Dr. Blochmann, p. 104, note.)** Karakorum mountains, Western Tibet.*** According to the same tradition the now desolate regions of the waterless land of Tarim -- a true wilderness in the heart ofTurkestan -- were in the days of old covered with flourishing and wealthy cities. At present, hardly a few verdant oases relieve its deadsolitude. One such, sprung on the sepulchre of a vast city swallowed by and buried under the sandy soil of the desert, belongs to noone, but is often visited by Mongolians and Buddhists. The same tradition speaks of immense subterranean abodes, of large corridorsfilled with tiles and cylinders. It may be an idle rumour, and it may be an actual fact.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxv INTRODUCTORY.the reader rejects the truthfulness of the reports, let him pause and reflect over the following well known facts. The collectiveresearches of the Orientalists, and especially the labours of late years of the students of comparative Philology and the Science ofReligions have led them to ascertain as follows: An immense, incalculable number of MSS., and even printed works known to haveexisted, are now to be found no more. They have disappeared without leaving the slightest trace behind them. Were they works of noimportance they might, in the natural course of time, have been left to perish, and their very names would have been obliterated fromhuman memory. But it is not so; for, as now ascertained, most of them contained the true keys to works still extant, and entirelyincomprehensible, for the greater portion of their readers, without those additional volumes of Commentaries and explanations. Suchare, for instance, the works of Lao-tse, the predecessor of Confucius.*He is said to have written 930 books on Ethics and religions, and seventy on magic, one thousand in all. His great work, however, theheart of his doctrine, the \"Tao-te-King,\" or the sacred scriptures of the Taosse, has in it, as Stanislas Julien shows, only \"about 5,000words\" (Tao-te-King, p. xxvii.), hardly a dozen of pages, yet Professor Max Muller finds that \"the text is unintelligible withoutcommentaries, so that Mr. Julien had to consult more than sixty commentators for the purpose of his translation,\" the earliest goingback as far as the year 163 B.C., not earlier, as we see. During the four centuries and a half that preceded this earliest of thecommentators there was ample time to veil the true Lao-tse doctrine from all but his initiated priests. The Japanese, among whom arenow to be found the most learned of the priests and followers of Lao-tse, simply laugh at the blunders and hypotheses of theEuropean Chinese scholars; and tradition affirms that the commentaries to which our Western Sinologues have access are not the realoccult records, but intentional veils, and that the true commentaries, as well as almost all the texts, have long since disappeared fromthe eyes of the profane.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"If we turn to China, we find that the religion of Confucius is founded on the Five King and the Four Shu-books, in themselves ofconsiderable extent and surrounded by voluminous Commentaries, without which even the most learned scholars would not venture tofathom the depth of their sacred canon.\" (Lectures on the \"Science of Religion,\" p. 185. Max Muller.) But they have not fathomed it --and this is the complaint of the Confucianists, as a very learned member of that body, in Paris, complained in 1881.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxvi INTRODUCTORY.If one turns to the ancient literature of the Semitic religions, to the Chaldean Scriptures, the elder sister and instructress, if not thefountain-head of the Mosaic Bible, the basis and starting-point of Christianity, what do the scholars find? To perpetuate the memory"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of the ancient religions of Babylon; to record the vast cycle of astronomical observations of the Chaldean Magi; to justify the traditionof their splendid and eminently occult literature, what now remains? -- only a few fragments, said to be by Berosus.These, however, are almost valueless, even as a clue to the character of what has disappeared. For they passed through the hands ofhis Reverence the Bishop of Caesarea -- that self-constituted censor and editor of the sacred records of other men's religions -- andthey doubtless bear to this day the mark of his eminently veracious and trustworthy hand. For what is the history of this treatise on theonce grand religion of Babylon?Written in Greek by Berosus, a priest of the temple of Belus, for Alexander the Great, from the astronomical and chronological recordspreserved by the priests of that temple, and covering a period of 200,000 years, it is now lost. In the first century B.C. AlexanderPolyhistor made a series of extracts from it -- also lost. Eusebius used these extracts in writing his Chronicon (270-340 A.D.). The pointsof resemblance -- almost of identity -- between the Jewish and the Chaldean Scriptures,* made the latter most dangerous to Eusebius,in his role of defender and champion of the new faith which had adopted the Jewish Scriptures, and with them an absurd chronology.It is pretty certain that Eusebius did not spare the Egyptian Synchronistic tables of Manetho -- so much so that Bunsen** charges himwith mutilating history most unscrupulously. And Socrates, a historian of the fifth century, and Syncellus, vice-patriarch ofConstantinople (eighth century), both denounce him as the most daring and desperate forger.Is it likely, then, that he dealt more tenderly with the Chaldean records, which were already menacing the new religion, so rashlyaccepted?[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Found out and proven only now, through the discoveries made by George Smith (vide his \"Chaldean account of Genesis\"), andwhich, thanks to this Armenian forger, have misled all the civilized nations for over 1,500 years into accepting Jewish derivations fordirect Divine Revelation!** Bunsen's \"Egypt's Place in History,\" vol. i. p. 200------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxvii INTRODUCTORY.So that, with the exception of these more than doubtful fragments, the entire Chaldean sacred literature has disappeared from theeyes of the profane as completely as the lost Atlantis. A few facts that were contained in the Berosian History are given in Part II. ofVol. II., and may throw a great light on the true origin of the Fallen Angels, personified by Bel and the Dragon.Turning now to the oldest Aryan literature, the Rig-Veda, the student will find, following strictly in this the data furnished by the saidOrientalists themselves, that, although the Rig-Veda contains only \"about 10,580 verses, or 1,028 hymns,\" in spite of the Brahmanasand the mass of glosses and commentaries, it is not understood correctly to this day. Why is this so? Evidently because theBrahmanas, \"the scholastic and oldest treatises on the primitive hymns,\" themselves require a key, which the Orientalists have failedto secure.What do the scholars say of Buddhist literature? Have they got it in its completeness? Assuredly not. Notwithstanding the 325 volumesof the Kanjur and the Tanjur of the Northern Buddhists, each volume we are told, \"weighing from four to five pounds,\" nothing, intruth, is known of Lamaism. Yet, the sacred canon of the Southern Church is said to contain 29,368,000 letters in the Saddharmaalankara,* or, exclusive of treatises and commentaries, \"five or six times the amount of the matter contained in the Bible,\" the latter,in the words of Professor Max Muller, rejoicing only in 3,567,180 letters. Notwithstanding, then, these \"325 volumes\" (in reality thereare 333, Kanjur comprising 108, and Tanjur 225 volumes), \"the translators, instead of supplying us with correct versions, haveinterwoven them with their own commentaries, for the purpose of justifying the dogmas of their several schools.\"** Moreover,\"according to a tradition preserved by the Buddhist schools, both of the South and of the North, the sacred Buddhist Canon comprisedoriginally 80,000 or 84,000 tracts, but most of them were lost, so that there remained but 6,000,\" the professor tells his audiences.\"Lost\" as usual for Europeans. But who can be quite sure that they are likewise lost for Buddhists and Brahmins?Considering the sacredness for the Buddhists of every line written[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Spence Hardy, \"The Legends and Theories of the Buddhists,\" p. 66.** \"Buddhism in Tibet,\" p. 78.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxviii INTRODUCTORY.upon Buddha or his \"Good Law,\" the loss of nearly 76,000 tracts does seem miraculous. Had it been vice versa, every one acquaintedwith the natural course of events would subscribe to the statement that, of these 76,000, five or six thousand treatises might have beendestroyed during the persecutions in, and emigrations from, India. But as it is well ascertained that Buddhist Arhats began theirreligious exodus, for the purpose of propagating the new faith beyond Kashmir and the Himalayas, as early as the year 300 before ourera,* and reached China in the year 61 A.D.** when Kashyapa, at the invitation of the Emperor Ming-ti, went there to acquaint the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"Son of Heaven\" with the tenets of Buddhism, it does seem strange to hear the Orientalists speaking of such a loss as though it werereally possible. They do not seem to allow for one moment the possibility that the texts may be lost only for West and for themselves;or, that the Asiatic people should have the unparalleled boldness to keep their most sacred records out of the reach of foreigners, thusrefusing to deliver them to the profanation and misuse of races even so \"vastly superior\" to themselves.Owing to the expressed regrets and numerous confessions of almost every one of the Orientalists (See Max Muller's Lectures forexample) the public may feel sufficiently sure (a) that the students of ancient religions have indeed very few data upon which to buildsuch final conclusions as they generally do about the old religions, and (b) that such lack of data does not prevent them in the leastfrom dogmatising. One would imagine that, thanks to the numerous records of the Egyptian theogony and mysteries preserved in theclassics, and in a number of ancient writers, the rites and dogmas of Pharaonic Egypt ought to be well understood at least; better, atany rate, than the too abstruse philosophies and Pantheism of India, of whose religion and language Europe had hardly any ideabefore the beginning of the present century. Along the Nile and on the face of the whole country, there stand to this hour, exhumedyearly and daily, fresh relics which eloquently tell their own history. Still it is not so. The learned Oxford philologist himself confessesthe truth by saying that \"Though . . . we see still standing the Pyramids, and the ruins of temples and labyrinths, their walls[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Lassen, (\"Ind. Althersumkunde\" Vol. II, p. 1,072) shows a Buddhist monastery erected in the Kailas range in 137 B.C.; and GeneralCunningham, earlier than that.** Reverend T. Edkins, \"Chinese Buddhism.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxix INTRODUCTORY.covered with hieroglyphic inscriptions, and with the strange pictures of gods and goddesses. . . . . On rolls of papyrus, which seem todefy the ravages of time, we have even fragments of what may be called the sacred books of the Egyptians; yet, though much hasbeen deciphered in the ancient records of that mysterious race, the mainspring of the religion of Egypt and the original intention of itsceremonial worship are far from being fully disclosed to us.\"* Here again the mysterious hieroglyphic documents remain, but the keysby which alone they become intelligible have disappeared.Nevertheless, having found that \"there is a natural connection between language and religion\"; and, secondly, that there was acommon Aryan religion before the separation of the Aryan race; a common Semitic religion before the separation of the Semiticrace; and a common Turanian religion before the separation of the Chinese and the other tribes belonging to the Turanian class;having, in fact, only discovered \"three ancient centres of religion\" and \"three centres of language,\" and though as entirely ignorant ofthose primitive religions and languages, as of their origin, the professor does not hesitate to declare \"that a truly historical basis for ascientific treatment of those principal religions of the world has been gained!\"A \"scientific treatment\" of a subject is no guarantee for its \"historical basis\"; and with such scarcity of data on hand, no philologist,even among the most eminent, is justified in giving out his own conclusions for historical facts. No doubt, the eminent Orientalist hasproved thoroughly to the world's satisfaction, that according to Grimm's law of phonetic rules, Odin and Buddha are two differentpersonages, quite distinct from each other, and he has shown it scientifically. When, however, he takes the opportunity of saying in thesame breath that Odin \"was worshipped as the supreme deity during a period long anterior to the age of the Veda and of Homer\"(Compar. Theol., p. 318), he has not the slightest \"historical basis\" for it. He makes history and fact subservient to his[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* So little acquainted are our greatest Egyptologists with the funerary rites of the Egyptians and the outward marks of the difference ofsexes made on the mummies, that it has led to the most ludicrous mistakes.

The mummy of what had been considered the wife of an unimportant Pharaoh, has turned out, thanks to aninscription found on an amulet hung on his neck, to be that of Sesostris -- the greatest King of Egypt!------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxx INTRODUCTORY.own conclusions, which may be very \"scientific,\" in the sight of Oriental scholars, but yet very wide of the mark of actual truth. Theconflicting views on the subject of chronology, in the case of the Vedas, of the various eminent philologists and Orientalists, fromMartin Haug down to Mr. Max Muller himself, are an evident proof that the statement has no historical basis to stand upon, \"internalevidence\" being very often a jack-o'lantern, instead of a safe beacon to follow. Nor has the Science of modern ComparativeMythology any better proof to show, that those learned writers, who have insisted for the last century or so that there must have been\"fragments of a primeval revelation, granted to the ancestors of the whole race of mankind . . . . preserved in the temples of Greeceand Italy,\" were entirely wrong. For this is what all the Eastern Initiates and Pundits have been proclaiming to the world from time totime. While a prominent Cinghalese priest assured the writer that it was well known that the most important Buddhist tracts belongingto the sacred canon were stored away in countries and places inaccessible to the European pundits, the late Swami DayanandSarasvati, the greatest Sanskritist of his day in India, assured some members of the Theosophical Society of the same fact with regardto ancient Brahmanical works. When told that Professor Max Muller had declared to the audiences of his \"Lectures\" that the theory . . .. \"that there was a primeval preternatural revelation granted to the fathers of the human race, finds but few supporters at present,\" --the holy and learned man laughed. His answer was suggestive. \"If Mr. Moksh Mooller, as he pronounced the name, were a Brahmin,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"and came with me, I might take him to a gupta cave (a secret crypt) near Okhee Math, in the Himalayas, where he would soon findout that what crossed the Kalapani (the black waters of the ocean) from India to Europe were only the bits of rejected copies of somepassages from our sacred books. There was a \"primeval revelation,\" and it still exists; nor will it ever be lost to the world, but willreappear; though the Mlechchhas will of course have to wait.\"Questioned further on this point, he would say no more. This was at Meerut, in 1880.No doubt the mystification played, in the last century at Calcutta, by the Brahmins upon Colonel Wilford and Sir William Jones was acruel one. But it had been well deserved, and no one was more to be blamed------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxi INTRODUCTORY.in that affair than the Missionaries and Colonel Wilford themselves. The former, on the testimony of Sir William Jones himself (seeAsiat. Res., Vol. I., p. 272), were silly enough to maintain that \"the Hindus were even now almost Christians, because their Brahma,Vishnu and Mahesa were no other than the Christian trinity.\"* It was a good lesson. It made the Oriental scholars doubly cautious; butperchance it has also made some of them too shy, and caused, in its reaction, the pendulum of foregone conclusions to swing toomuch the other way. For \"that first supply on the Brahmanical market,\" made for Colonel Wilford, has now created an evidentnecessity and desire in the Orientalists to declare nearly every archaic Sanskrit manuscript so modern as to give to the missionaries fulljustification for availing themselves of the opportunity. That they do so and to the full extent of their mental powers, is shown by theabsurd attempts of late to prove that the whole Puranic story about Chrishna was plagiarized by the Brahmins from the Bible! But thefacts cited by the Oxford Professor in his Lectures on the \"Science of Religion,\" concerning the now famous interpolations, for thebenefit, and later on to the sorrow, of Col. Wilford, do not at all interfere with the conclusions to which one who studies the SecretDoctrine must unavoidably come. For, if the results show that neither the New nor even the Old Testament borrowed anything fromthe more ancient religion of the Brahmans and Buddhists, it does not follow that the Jews have not borrowed all they knew from theChaldean records, the latter being mutilated later on by Eusebius. As to the Chaldeans, they assuredly got their primitive learningfrom the Brahmans, for Rawlinson shows an undeniably Vedic influence in the early mythology of Babylon; and Col. Vans Kennedyhas long since justly declared that Babylonia was, from her origin, the seat of Sanskrit and Brahman learning. But all such proofs mustlose their value, in the presence of the latest theory worked out by Prof. Max Muller. What it is everyone knows. The code of phoneticlaws has now become a universal solvent for every identification and \"connection\" between[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Max Muller's \"Introduction to the Science of Religion.\" Lecture On False Analogies in comparative Theology, pp. 288 and 296et seq. This relates to the clever forgery (on leaves inserted in old Puranic MSS.), in correct and archaic Sanskrit, of all that thePundits of Col. Wilford had heard from him about Adam and Abraham, Noah and his three sons, etc., etc------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxii INTRODUCTORY.the gods of many nations. Thus, though the Mother of Mercury (Budha, Thot-Hermes, etc.), was Maia, the mother of Buddha(Gautama), also Maya, and the mother of Jesus, likewise Maya (illusion, for Mary is Mare, the Sea, the great illusion symbolically) --yet these three characters have no connection, nor can they have any, since Bopp, has \"laid down his code of phonetic laws.\"In their efforts to collect together the many skeins of unwritten history, it is a bold step for our Orientalists to take, to deny, a priori,everything that does not dovetail with their special conclusions. Thus, while new discoveries are daily made of great arts and scienceshaving existed far back in the night of time, even the knowledge of writing is refused to some of the most ancient nations, and theyare credited with barbarism instead of culture. Yet the traces of an immense civilization, even in Central Asia, are still to be found.This civilization is undeniably prehistoric. And how can there be civilization without a literature, in some form, without annals orchronicles? Common sense alone ought to supplement the broken links in the history of departed nations. The gigantic, unbroken wallof the mountains that hem in the whole table-land of Tibet, from the upper course of the river Khuan-Khe down to the Kara-Korumhills, witnessed a civilization during millenniums of years, and would have strange secrets to tell mankind. The Eastern and Centralportions of those regions -- the Nan-Schayn and the Altyne-taga -- were once upon a time covered with cities that could well vie withBabylon. A whole geological period has swept over the land, since those cities breathed their last, as the mounds of shifting sand, andthe sterile and now dead soil of the immense central plains of the basin of Tarim testify. The borderlands alone are superficiallyknown to the traveller. Within those table-lands of sand there is water, and fresh oases are found blooming there, wherein noEuropean foot has ever yet ventured, or trodden the now treacherous soil. Among these verdant oases there are some which areentirely inaccessible even to the native profane traveller. Hurricanes may \"tear up the sands and sweep whole plains away,\" they arepowerless to destroy that which is beyond their reach. Built deep in the bowels of the earth, the subterranean stores are secure; and astheir entrances are concealed in such oases, there is little fear that any one should discover them, even should several armies invadethe sandy wastes where --------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxiii INTRODUCTORY.\"Not a pool, not a bush, not a house is seen,And the mountain-range forms a rugged screenRound the parch'd flats of the dry, dry desert. . . . .\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"But there is no need to send the reader across the desert, when the same proofs of ancient civilization are found even incomparatively populated regions of the same country. The oasis of Tchertchen, for instance, situated about 4,000 feet above thelevel of the river Tchertchen-D'arya, is surrounded with the ruins of archaic towns and cities in every direction. There, some 3,000human beings represent the relics of about a hundred extinct nations and races -- the very names of which are now unknown to ourethnologists. An anthropologist would feel more than embarrassed to class, divide and subdivide them; the more so, as the respectivedescendants of all these antediluvian races and tribes know as little of their own forefathers themselves, as if they had fallen from themoon. When questioned about their origin, they reply that they know not whence their fathers had come, but had heard that their first(or earliest) men were ruled by the great genii of these deserts. This may be put down to ignorance and superstition, yet in view of theteachings of the Secret Doctrine, the answer may be based upon primeval tradition. Alone, the tribe of Khoorassan claims to havecome from what is now known as Afghanistan, long before the days of Alexander, and brings legendary lore to that effect ascorroboration. The Russian traveller, Colonel (now General) Prjevalsky, found quite close to the oasis of Tchertchen, the ruins of twoenormous cities, the oldest of which was, according to local tradition, ruined 3,000 years ago by a hero and giant; and the other bythe Mongolians in the tenth century of our era. \"The emplacement of the two cities is now covered, owing to shifting sands and thedesert wind, with strange and heterogeneous relics; with broken china and kitchen utensils and human bones. The natives often findcopper and gold coins, melted silver, ingots, diamonds, and turquoises, and what is the most remarkable -- broken glass. . . . .\" \"Coffinsof some undecaying wood, or material, also, within which beautifully preserved embalmed bodies are found. . . . . The malemummies are all extremely tall powerfully built men with long waving hair. . . . .

Her eyes were closed with golden discs, and the jaws held firmby a golden circlet running from under the chin across the top of the head. Clad in a narrow------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxiv INTRODUCTORY.woollen garment, her bosom was covered with golden stars, the feet being left naked.\" (From a lecture by N. M. Prjevalsky.) To this,the famous traveller adds that all along their way on the river Tchertchen they heard legends about twenty-three towns buried agesago by the shifting sands of the deserts. The same tradition exists on the Lob-nor and in the oasis of Kerya.The traces of such civilization, and these and like traditions, give us the right to credit other legendary lore warranted by welleducated and learned natives of India and Mongolia, when they speak of immense libraries reclaimed from the sand, together withvarious reliques of ancient MAGIC lore, which have all been safely stowed away.To recapitulate. The Secret Doctrine was the universally diffused religion of the ancient and prehistoric world. Proofs of its diffusion,authentic records of its history, a complete chain of documents, showing its character and presence in every land, together with theteaching of all its great adepts, exist to this day in the secret crypts of libraries belonging to the Occult Fraternity.This statement is rendered more credible by a consideration of the following facts: the tradition of the thousands of ancientparchments saved when the Alexandrian library was destroyed; the thousands of Sanskrit works which disappeared in India in the reignof Akbar; the universal tradition in China and Japan that the true old texts with the commentaries, which alone make themcomprehensible -- amounting to many thousands of volumes -- have long passed out of the reach of profane hands; thedisappearance of the vast sacred and occult literature of Babylon; the loss of those keys which alone could solve the thousand riddlesof the Egyptian hieroglyphic records; the tradition in India that the real secret commentaries which alone make the Veda intelligible,though no longer visible to profane eyes, still remain for the initiate, hidden in secret caves and crypts; and an identical belief amongthe Buddhists, with regard to their secret books.The Occultists assert that all these exist, safe from Western spoliating hands, to re-appear in some more enlightened age, for which inthe words of the late Swami Dayanand Sarasvati, \"the Mlechchhas (outcasts, savages, those beyond the pale of Aryan civilization) willhave to wait.\"For it is not the fault of the initiates that these documents are now \"lost\" to the profane; nor was their policy dictated by selfishness, or------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxv INTRODUCTORY.any desire to monopolise the life-giving sacred lore. There were portions of the Secret Science that for incalculable ages had toremain concealed from the profane gaze. But this was because to impart to the unprepared multitude secrets of such tremendousimportance, was equivalent to giving a child a lighted candle in a powder magazine.The answer to a question which has frequently arisen in the minds of students, when meeting with statements such as this, may beoutlined here.\"We can understand,\" they say, \"the necessity for concealing from the herd such secrets as the Vril, or the rock-destroying force,discovered by J. W. Keely, of Philadelphia, but we cannot understand how any danger could arise from the revelation of such a purelyphilosophic doctrine, as, e.g., the evolution of the planetary chains.\"The danger was this: Doctrines such as the planetary chain, or the seven races, at once give a clue to the seven-fold nature of man,for each principle is correlated to a plane, a planet, and a race; and the human principles are, on every plane, correlated to seven-fold occult forces -- those of the higher planes being of tremendous power. So that any septenary division at once gives a clue to"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"tremendous occult powers, the abuse of which would cause incalculable evil to humanity. A clue, which is, perhaps, no clue to thepresent generation -- especially the Westerns -- protected as they are by their very blindness and ignorant materialistic disbelief in theoccult; but a clue which would, nevertheless, have been very real in the early centuries of the Christian era, to people fully convincedof the reality of occultism, and entering a cycle of degradation, which made them rife for abuse of occult powers and sorcery of theworst description.The documents were concealed, it is true, but the knowledge itself and its actual existence had never been made a secret of by theHierophants of the Temple, wherein MYSTERIES have ever been made a discipline and stimulus to virtue. This is very old news, andwas repeatedly made known by the great adepts, from Pythagoras and Plato down to the Neoplatonists. It was the new religion of theNazarenes that wrought a change for the worse -- in the policy of centuries.Moreover, there is a well-known fact, a very curious one, corroborated to the writer by a reverend gentleman attached for years to aRussian Embassy -- namely, that there are several documents in the St. Peters-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxvi INTRODUCTORY.burg Imperial Libraries to show that, even so late as during the days when Freemasonry, and Secret Societies of Mystics flourishedunimpeded in Russia, i.e., at the end of the last and the beginning of the present century, more than one Russian Mystic travelled toTibet via the Ural mountains in search of knowledge and initiation in the unknown crypts of Central Asia. And more than one returnedyears later, with a rich store of such information as could never have been given him anywhere in Europe. Several cases could becited, and well-known names brought forward, but for the fact that such publicity might annoy the surviving relatives of the said lateInitiates. Let any one look over the Annals and History of Freemasonry in the archives of the Russian metropolis, and he will assurehimself of the fact stated.This is a corroboration of that which has been stated many times before, and, unfortunately, too indiscreetly. Instead of benefitinghumanity, the virulent charges of deliberate invention and imposture with a purpose thrown at those who asserted but a truthful, ifeven a little known fact, have only generated bad Karma for the slanderers. But now the mischief is done, and truth should no longerbe denied, whatever the consequences. Is it a new religion, we are asked? By no means; it is not a religion, nor is its philosophy new;for, as already stated, it is as old as thinking man. Its tenets are not now published for the first time, but have been cautiously givenout to, and taught by, more than one European Initiate -- especially by the late Ragon.More than one great scholar has stated that there never was a religious founder, whether Aryan, Semitic or Turanian, who hadinvented a new religion, or revealed a new truth. These founders were all transmitters, not original teachers. They were the authors ofnew forms and interpretations, while the truths upon which the latter were based were as old as mankind. Selecting one or more ofthose grand verities -- actualities visible only to the eye of the real Sage and Seer -- out of the many orally revealed to man in thebeginning, preserved and perpetuated in the adyta of the temples through initiation, during the MYSTERIES and by personaltransmission -- they revealed these truths to the masses. Thus every nation received in its turn some of the said truths, under the veil ofits own local and special symbolism; which, as time went on, developed into a more or less philosophical cultus, a Pantheon inmythical disguise. Therefore is Confucius, a very ancient------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xxxvii INTRODUCTORY.legislator in historical chronology, though a very modern Sage in the World's History, shown by Dr. Legge* -- who calls him\"emphatically a transmitter, not a maker\" -- as saying: \"I only hand on: I cannot create new things. I believe in the ancients andtherefore I love them.\"** (Quoted in \"Science of Religions\" by Max Muller.)The writer loves them too, and therefore believes in the ancients, and the modern heirs to their Wisdom. And believing in both, shenow transmits that which she has received and learnt herself to all those who will accept it. As to those who may reject her testimony, -- i.e., the great majority -- she will bear them no malice, for they will be as right in their way in denying, as she is right in hers inaffirming, since they look at TRUTH from two entirely different stand-points. Agreeably with the rules of critical scholarship, theOrientalist has to reject a priori whatever evidence he cannot fully verify for himself. And how can a Western scholar accept onhearsay that which he knows nothing about? Indeed, that which is given in these volumes is selected from oral, as much as fromwritten teachings. This first instalment of the esoteric doctrines is based upon Stanzas, which are the records of a people unknown toethnology; it is claimed that they are written in a tongue absent from the nomenclature of languages and dialects with whichphilology is acquainted; they are said to emanate from a source (Occultism) repudiated by science; and, finally, they are offeredthrough an agency, incessantly discredited before the world by all those who hate unwelcome truths, or have some special hobby oftheir own to defend. Therefore, the rejection of these teachings may be expected, and must be accepted beforehand. No one stylinghimself a \"scholar,\" in whatever department of exact science, will be permitted to regard these teachings seriously. They will bederided and rejected a priori in this century; but only in this one. For in the twentieth century of our era scholars will begin torecognize that the Secret Doctrine has neither been invented nor exaggerated, but, on the contrary, simply outlined; and finally, thatits teachings antedate the Vedas.*** Have not the latter been derided, rejected, and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Lun Yu (§ I a) Schott. \"Chinesische Literatur,\" p. 7."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"** \"Life of Confucius,\" p. 96.*** This is no pretension to prophecy, but simply a statement based on the knowledge of facts.

Was not Sanskrit proclaimed at one time the progeny of, and a dialectderived from, the Greek, according to Lempriere and other scholars? About 1820, Prof. Max Muller tells us, the sacred books of theBrahmans, of the Magians, and of the Buddhists, \"were all but unknown, their very existence was doubted, and there was not a singlescholar who could have translated a line of the Veda . . . of the Zend Avesta, or . . . of the Buddhist Tripitaka, and now the Vedas areproved to be the work of the highest antiquity whose 'preservation amounts almost to a marvel' (Lecture on the Vedas).The same will be said of the Secret Archaic Doctrine, when proofs are given of its undeniable existence and records. But it will takecenturies before much more is given from it. Speaking of the keys to the Zodiacal mysteries as being almost lost to the world, it wasremarked by the writer in \"Isis Unveiled\" some ten years ago that: \"The said key must be turned seven times before the whole system isdivulged. We will give it but one turn, and thereby allow the profane one glimpse into the mystery. Happy he, who understands thewhole!\"The same may be said of the whole Esoteric system. One turn of the key, and no more, was given in \"Isis.\" Much more is explained inthese volumes. In those days the writer hardly knew the language in which the work was written, and the disclosure of many things,freely spoken about now, was forbidden. In Century the Twentieth some disciple more informed, and far better fitted, may be sent bythe Masters of Wisdom to give final and irrefutable proofs that there exists a Science called Gupta-Vidya; and that, like the once-mysterious sources of the Nile, the source of all religions and philosophies now known to the world has been for many ages forgottenand lost to men, but is at last found.Such a work as this has to be introduced with no simple Preface, but with a volume rather; one that would give facts, not meredisquisitions, since the SECRET DOCTRINE is not a treatise, or a series of vague theories, but contains all that can be given out tothe world in this century.It would be worse than useless to publish in these pages even those[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] is no vain superstition.

Such statements as will now be made, have to be shownwarranted by various authorities: those of ancient philosophers, classics and even certain learned Church Fathers, some of whom knewthese doctrines because they had studied them, had seen and read works written upon them; and some of whom had even beenpersonally initiated into the ancient Mysteries, during the performance of which the arcane doctrines were allegorically enacted. Thewriter will have to give historical and trustworthy names, and to cite well-known authors, ancient and modern, of recognized ability,good judgment, and truthfulness, as also to name some of the famous proficients in the secret arts and science, along with themysteries of the latter, as they are divulged, or, rather, partially presented before the public in their strange archaic form.How is this to be done? What is the best way for achieving such an object? was the ever-recurring question. To make our plan clearer,an illustration may be attempted. When a tourist coming from a well-explored country, suddenly reaches the borderland of a terraincognita, hedged in, and shut out from view by a formidable barrier of impassable rocks, he may still refuse to acknowledge himselfbaffled in his exploratory plans. Ingress beyond is forbidden. But, if he cannot visit the mysterious region personally, he may still find ameans of examining it from as short a distance as can be arrived at. Helped by his knowledge of landscapes left behind him, he canget a general and pretty correct idea of the transmural view, if he will only climb to the loftiest summit of the altitudes in front of him.Once there, he can gaze at it, at his leisure, comparing that which he dimly perceives with that which he has just left below, now thathe is, thanks to his efforts, beyond the line of the mists and the cloud-capped cliffs.Such a point of preliminary observation, for those who would like to get a more correct understanding of the mysteries of the pre-archaic periods given in the texts, cannot be offered to them in these two volumes. But if the reader has patience, and would glanceat the present state of beliefs and creeds in Europe, compare and check it with what is known to history of the ages directly precedingand------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xl INTRODUCTORY.following the Christian era, then he will find all this in Volume III. of this work."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"In that volume a brief recapitulation will be made of all the principal adepts known to history, and the downfall of the mysteries willbe described; after which began the disappearance and final and systematic elimination from the memory of men of the real natureof initiation and the Sacred Science. From that time its teachings became Occult, and Magic sailed but too often under thevenerable but frequently misleading name of Hermetic philosophy. As real Occultism had been prevalent among the Mystics duringthe centuries that preceded our era, so Magic, or rather Sorcery, with its Occult Arts, followed the beginning of Christianity.However great and zealous the fanatical efforts, during those early centuries, to obliterate every trace of the mental and intellectuallabour of the Pagans, it was a failure; but the same spirit of the dark demon of bigotry and intolerance has perverted systematicallyand ever since, every bright page written in the pre-Christian periods. Even in her uncertain records, history has preserved enough ofthat which has survived to throw an impartial light upon the whole. Let, then, the reader tarry a little while with the writer, on the spotof observation selected. He is asked to give all his attention to that millennium which divided the pre-Christian and the post-Christianperiods, by the year ONE of the Nativity. This event -- whether historically correct or not -- has nevertheless been made to serve as afirst signal for the erection of manifold bulwarks against any possible return of, or even a glimpse into, the hated religions of the Past;hated and dreaded -- because throwing such a vivid light on the new and intentionally veiled interpretation of what is now known asthe \"New Dispensation.\"However superhuman the efforts of the early Christian fathers to obliterate the Secret Doctrine from the very memory of man, they allfailed. Truth can never be killed; hence the failure to sweep away entirely from the face of the earth every vestige of that ancientWisdom, and to shackle and gag every witness who testified to it. Let one only think of the thousands, and perhaps millions, of MSS.burnt; of monuments, with their too indiscreet inscriptions and pictorial symbols, pulverised to dust; of the bands of early hermits andascetics roaming about among the ruined cities of Upper and Lower Egypt, in desert and------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xli INTRODUCTORY.mountain, valleys and highlands, seeking for and eager to destroy every obelisk and pillar, scroll or parchment they could lay theirhands on, if it only bore the symbol of the tau, or any other sign borrowed and appropriated by the new faith; and he will then seeplainly how it is that so little has remained of the records of the Past. Verily, the fiendish spirits of fanaticism, of early and mediaevalChristianity and of Islam, have from the first loved to dwell in darkness and ignorance; and both have made\"-------------- the sun like blood, the earth a tomb,The tomb a hell, and hell itself a murkier gloom!\"Both creeds have won their proselytes at the point of the sword; both have built their churches on heaven-kissing hecatombs of humanvictims. Over the gateway of Century I. of our era, the ominous words \"the KARMA OF ISRAEL,\" fatally glowed. Over the portals of ourown, the future seer may discern other words, that will point to the Karma for cunningly made-up HISTORY, for events purposelyperverted, and for great characters slandered by posterity, mangled out of recognition, between the two cars of Jagannatha -- Bigotryand Materialism; one accepting too much, the other denying all. Wise is he who holds to the golden mid-point, who believes in theeternal justice of things. Says Faigi Diwan, the \"witness to the wonderful speeches of a free-thinker who belongs to a thousand sects\":\"In the assembly of the day of resurrection, when past things shall be forgiven, the sins of the Ka'bah will be forgiven for the sake ofthe dust of Christian churches.\" To this, Professor Max Muller replies: \"The sins of Islam are as worthless as the dust of Christianity. Onthe day of resurrection both Muhammadans and Christians will see the vanity of their religious doctrines. Men fight about religion onearth -- in heaven they shall find out that there is only one true religion -- the worship of God's SPIRIT.\"*In other words -- \"THERE IS NO RELIGION (OR LAW) HIGHER THAN TRUTH\" -- \"SATYAT NASTI PARO DHARMAH\" -- the motto ofthe Maharajah of Benares, adopted by the Theosophical Society.As already said in the Preface, the Secret Doctrine is not a version of \"Isis Unveiled\" -- as originally intended. It is a volumeexplanatory of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Lectures on the Science of Religion,\" by F. Max Muller, p. 257.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlii INTRODUCTORY.it rather, and, though entirely independent of the earlier work, an indispensable corollary to it. Much of what was in Isis could hardlybe understood by theosophists in those days. The Secret Doctrine will now throw light on many a problem left unsolved in the firstwork, especially on the opening pages, which have never been understood.Concerned simply with the philosophies within our historical times and the respective symbolism of the fallen nations, only a hurriedglance could be thrown at the panorama of Occultism in the two volumes of Isis. In the present work, detailed Cosmogony and theevolution of the four races that preceded our Fifth race Humanity are given, and now two large volumes explain that which was statedon the first page of ISIS UNVEILED alone, and in a few allusions scattered hither and thither throughout that work. Nor could the vastcatalogue of the Archaic Sciences be attempted in the present volumes, before we have disposed of such tremendous problems asCosmic and Planetary Evolution, and the gradual development of the mysterious Humanities and races that preceded our \"Adamic\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Humanity. Therefore, the present attempt to elucidate some mysteries of the Esoteric philosophy has, in truth, nothing to do with theearlier work. As an instance, the writer must be allowed to illustrate what is said.Volume I. of \"Isis\" begins with a reference to \"an old book\" --\"So very old that our modern antiquarians might ponder over its pages an indefinite time, and still not quite agree as to the nature ofthe fabric upon which it is written. It is the only original copy now in existence. The most ancient Hebrew document on occult learning-- the Siphrah Dzeniouta -- was compiled from it, and that at a time when the former was already considered in the light of a literaryrelic. One of its illustrations represents the Divine Essence emanating from ADAM* like a luminous arc proceeding to form a circle;and then, having attained the highest point of its circumference, the ineffable glory bends back again, and returns to earth, bringing ahigher type of humanity in its vortex. As it approaches nearer and nearer to our planet, the Emanation becomes more and moreshadowy, until upon touching the ground it is as black as night.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The name is used in the sense of the Greek word [[anthropos]].------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xliii INTRODUCTORY.The \"very old Book\" is the original work from which the many volumes of Kiu-ti were compiled. Not only this latter and the SiphrahDzeniouta but even the Sepher Jezirah,* the work attributed by the Hebrew Kabalists to their Patriarch Abraham (!), the book of Shu-king, China's primitive Bible, the sacred volumes of the Egyptian Thoth-Hermes, the Puranas in India, and the Chaldean Book ofNumbers and the Pentateuch itself, are all derived from that one small parent volume. Tradition says, that it was taken down inSenzar, the secret sacerdotal tongue, from the words of the Divine Beings, who dictated it to the sons of Light, in Central Asia, at thevery beginning of the 5th (our) race; for there was a time when its language (the Sen-zar) was known to the Initiates of every nation,when the forefathers of the Toltec understood it as easily as the inhabitants of the lost Atlantis, who inherited it, in their turn, from thesages of the 3rd Race, the Manushis, who learnt it direct from the Devas of the 2nd and 1st Races. The \"illustration\" spoken of in \"Isis\"relates to the evolution of these Races and of our 4th and 5th Race Humanity in the Vaivasvata Manvantara or \"Round\"; each Roundbeing composed of the Yugas of the seven periods of Humanity; four of which are now passed in our life cycle, the middle point of the5th being nearly reached. The illustration is symbolical, as every one can well understand, and covers the ground from the beginning.The old book, having described Cosmic Evolution and explained the origin of everything on earth, including physical man, aftergiving the true history of the races from the First down to the Fifth (our) race, goes no further. It stops short at the beginning of the KaliYuga just 4989 years ago at the death of Krishna, the bright \"Sun-god,\" the once living hero and reformer.But there exists another book. None of its possessors regard it as very ancient, as it was born with, and is only as old as the Black Age,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Rabbi Jehoshua Ben Chananea, who died about A.D. 72, openly declared that he had performed \"miracles\" by means of the Bookof Sepher Jezireh, and challenged every sceptic. Franck, quoting from the Babylonian Talmud, names two other thaumaturgists,Rabbis Chanina and Oshoi. (See \"Jerusalem Talmud, Sanhedrin,\" c. 7, etc.; and \"Franck,\" pp. 55, 56.) Many of the MediaevalOccultists, Alchemists, and Kabalists claimed the same; and even the late modern Magus, Eliphas Levi, publicly asserts it in print inhis books on Magic.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xliv INTRODUCTORY.namely, about 5,000 years. In about nine years hence, the first cycle of the first five millenniums, that began with the great cycle ofthe Kali-Yuga, will end. And then the last prophecy contained in that book (the first volume of the prophetic record for the Black Age)will be accomplished. We have not long to wait, and many of us will witness the Dawn of the New Cycle, at the end of which not a fewaccounts will be settled and squared between the races. Volume II. of the Prophecies is nearly ready, having been in preparationsince the time of Buddha's grand successor, Sankaracharya.One more important point must be noticed, one that stands foremost in the series of proofs given of the existence of one primeval,universal Wisdom -- at any rate for the Christian Kabalists and students. The teachings were, at least, partially known to several of theFathers of the Church. It is maintained, on purely historical grounds, that Origen, Synesius, and even Clemens Alexandrinus, hadbeen themselves initiated into the mysteries before adding to the Neo-Platonism of the Alexandrian school, that of the Gnostics,under the Christian veil. More than this, some of the doctrines of the Secret schools -- though by no means all -- were preserved in theVatican, and have since become part and parcel of the mysteries, in the shape of disfigured additions made to the original Christianprogramme by the Latin Church. Such is the now materialised dogma of the Immaculate Conception. This accounts for the greatpersecutions set on foot by the Roman Catholic Church against Occultism, Masonry, and heterodox mysticism generally.The days of Constantine were the last turning-point in history, the period of the Supreme struggle that ended in the Western worldthrottling the old religions in favour of the new one, built on their bodies. From thence the vista into the far distant Past, beyond the\"Deluge\" and the Garden of Eden, began to be forcibly and relentlessly closed by every fair and unfair means against the indiscreetgaze of posterity. Every issue was blocked up, every record that hands could be laid upon, destroyed. Yet there remains enough, evenamong such mutilated records, to warrant us in saying that there is in them every possible evidence of the actual existence of a Parent"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Doctrine. Fragments have survived geological and political cataclysms to tell the story; and every survival shows evidence that thenow Secret Wisdom was once the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlv INTRODUCTORY.one fountain head, the ever-flowing perennial source, at which were fed all its streamlets -- the later religions of all nations -- from thefirst down to the last. This period, beginning with Buddha and Pythagoras at the one end and the Neo-Platonists and Gnostics at theother, is the only focus left in History wherein converge for the last time the bright rays of light streaming from the aeons of time goneby, unobscured by the hand of bigotry and fanaticism.This accounts for the necessity under which the writer has laboured to be ever explaining the facts given from the hoariest Past byevidence gathered from the historical period. No other means was at hand, at the risk even of being once more charged with a lack ofmethod and system. The public must be made acquainted with the efforts of many World-adepts, of initiated poets, writers, andclassics of every age, to preserve in the records of Humanity the Knowledge of the existence, at least, of such a philosophy, if notactually of its tenets. The Initiates of 1888 would indeed remain incomprehensible and ever a seemingly impossible myth, were notlike Initiates shown to have lived in every other age of history. This could be done only by naming Chapter and Verse where may befound mention of these great characters, who were preceded and followed by a long and interminable line of other famousAntediluvian and Post-diluvian Masters in the arts. Thus only could be shown, on semi-traditional and semi-historical authority, thatknowledge of the Occult and the powers it confers on man, are not altogether fictions, but that they are as old as the world itself.To my judges, past and future, therefore -- whether they are serious literary critics, or those howling dervishes in literature who judge abook according to the popularity or unpopularity of the author's name, who, hardly glancing at its contents, fasten like lethal bacilli onthe weakest points of the body -- I have nothing to say. Nor shall I condescend to notice those crack-brained slanderers -- fortunatelyvery few in number -- who, hoping to attract public attention by throwing discredit on every writer whose name is better known thantheir own, foam and bark at their very shadows. These, having first maintained for years that the doctrines taught in the Theosophist,and which culminated in \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" had been all invented by the present writer, have finally turned round, and denounced\"Isis Unveiled\" and the rest as a plagiarism from Eliphas Levi (!), Paracelsus (!!), and, mirabile------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlvi INTRODUCTORY.dictu, Buddhism and Brahmanism (!!!) As well charge Renan with having stolen his Vie de Jesus from the Gospels, and Max Muller his\"Sacred Books of the East\" or his \"Chips\" from the philosophies of the Brahmins and Gautama, the Buddha. But to the public ingeneral and the readers of the \"Secret Doctrine\" I may repeat what I have stated all along, and which I now clothe in the words ofMontaigne: Gentlemen, \"I HAVE HERE MADE ONLY A NOSEGAY OF CULLED FLOWERS, AND HAVE BROUGHT NOTHING OF MYOWN BUT THE STRING THAT TIES THEM.\"Pull the \"string\" to pieces and cut it up in shreds, if you will. As for the nosegay of FACTS -- you will never be able to make away withthese. You can only ignore them, and no more.We may close with a parting word concerning this Volume I. In an INTRODUCTION prefacing a Part dealing chiefly with Cosmogony,certain subjects brought forward might be deemed out of place, but one more consideration added to those already given have ledme to touch upon them. Every reader will inevitably judge the statements made from the stand-point of his own knowledge,experience, and consciousness, based on what he has already learnt. This fact the writer is constantly obliged to bear in mind: hence,also the frequent references in this first Book to matters which, properly speaking, belong to a later part of the work, but which couldnot be passed by in silence, lest the reader should look down on this work as a fairy tale indeed -- a fiction of some modern brain.Thus, the Past shall help to realise the PRESENT, and the latter to better appreciate the PAST. The errors of the day must beexplained and swept away, yet it is more than probable -- and in the present case it amounts to certitude -- that once more thetestimony of long ages and of history will fail to impress anyone but the very intuitional -- which is equal to saying the very few. But inthis as in all like cases, the true and the faithful may console themselves by presenting the sceptical modern Sadducee with themathematical proof and memorial of his obdurate obstinacy and bigotry. There still exists somewhere in the archives of the FrenchAcademy, the famous law of probabilities worked out by an algebraical process for the benefit of sceptics by certain mathematicians.It runs thus: If two persons give their evidence to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] xlvii INTRODUCTORY.a fact, and thus impart to it each of them 5/6 of certitude; that fact will have then 35/36 of certitude; i.e., its probability will bear to itsimprobability the ratio of 35 to 1. If three such evidences are joined together the certitude will become 215/216. The agreement often persons giving each 1/2 of certitude will produce 1023/1024, etc., etc. The Occultist may remain satisfied, and care for no more.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page xlviii]][[blank]]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page 1]]PROEM.-------PAGES FROM A PRE-HISTORIC PERIOD.AN Archaic Manuscript -- a collection of palm leaves made impermeable to water, fire, and air, by some specific unknown process -- isbefore the writer's eye. On the first page is an immaculate white disk within a dull black ground. On the following page, the same disk,but with a central point. The first, the student knows to represent Kosmos in Eternity, before the re-awakening of still slumberingEnergy, the emanation of the Word in later systems. The point in the hitherto immaculate Disk, Space and Eternity in Pralaya,denotes the dawn of differentiation. It is the Point in the Mundane Egg (see Part II., \"The Mundane Egg\"), the germ within the latterwhich will become the Universe, the ALL, the boundless, periodical Kosmos, this germ being latent and active, periodically and byturns. The one circle is divine Unity, from which all proceeds, whither all returns. Its circumference -- a forcibly limited symbol, in viewof the limitation of the human mind -- indicates the abstract, ever incognisable PRESENCE, and its plane, the Universal Soul,although the two are one. Only the face of the Disk being white and the ground all around black, shows clearly that its plane is theonly knowledge, dim and hazy though it still is, that is attainable by man. It is on this plane that the Manvantaric manifestationsbegin; for it is in this SOUL that slumbers, during the Pralaya, the Divine Thought,* wherein lies concealed the plan of every futureCosmogony and Theogony.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is hardly necessary to remind the reader once more that the term \"Divine Thought,\" like that of \"Universal Mind,\" must not beregarded as even vaguely shadowing forth an intellectual process akin to that exhibited by man. The \"Unconscious,\" according to vonHartmann, arrived at the vast creative, or rather Evolutionary Plan, \"by a clairvoyant wisdom superior to all consciousness,\" which inthe Vedantic language would mean absolute Wisdom. Only those who realise how far Intuition soars above the tardy processes ofratiocinative thought can form the faintest conception of [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 2 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.It is the ONE LIFE, eternal, invisible, yet Omnipresent, without beginning or end, yet periodical in its regular manifestations, betweenwhich periods reigns the dark mystery of non-Being; unconscious, yet absolute Consciousness; unrealisable, yet the one self-existingreality; truly, \"a chaos to the sense, a Kosmos to the reason.\" Its one absolute attribute, which is ITSELF, eternal, ceaseless Motion, iscalled in esoteric parlance the \"Great Breath,\"* which is the perpetual motion of the universe, in the sense of limitless, ever-presentSPACE. That which is motionless cannot be Divine. But then there is nothing in fact and reality absolutely motionless within theuniversal soul.Almost five centuries B.C. Leucippus, the instructor of Democritus, maintained that Space was filled eternally with atoms actuated bya ceaseless motion, the latter generating in due course of time, when those atoms aggregated, rotatory motion, through mutualcollisions producing lateral movements. Epicurus and Lucretius taught the same, only adding to the lateral motion of the atoms theidea of affinity -- an occult teaching.From the beginning of man's inheritance, from the first appearance of the architects of the globe he lives in, the unrevealed Deity wasrecognised and considered under its only philosophical aspect -- universal motion, the thrill of the creative Breath in Nature.Occultism sums up the \"One Existence\" thus: \"Deity is an arcane, living (or moving) FIRE, and the eternal witnesses to this unseenPresence are Light, Heat, Moisture,\" -- this trinity including, and being the cause of, every[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] that absolute Wisdom which transcends the ideas of Time and Space. Mind, as we know it,is resolvable into states of consciousness, of varying duration, intensity, complexity, etc. -- all, in the ultimate, resting on sensation,which is again Maya. Sensation, again, necessarily postulates limitation. The personal God of orthodox Theism perceives, thinks, andis affected by emotion; he repents and feels \"fierce anger.\" But the notion of such mental states clearly involves the unthinkablepostulate of the externality of the exciting stimuli, to say nothing of the impossibility of ascribing changelessness to a Being whoseemotions fluctuate with events in the worlds he presides over. The conceptions of a Personal God as changeless and infinite are thusunpsychological and, what is worse, unphilosophical.* Plato proves himself an Initiate, when saying in Cratylus that [[theos]] is derived from the verb [[theein]], \"to move,\" \"to run,\" as thefirst astronomers who observed the motions of the heavenly bodies called the planets [[theoi]], the gods.

As an eternal abstraction it is the EVER-PRESENT; as a manifestation, it is finite both in thecoming direction and the opposite, the two being the alpha and omega of successive reconstructions. Kosmos -- the NOUMENON --has nought to do with the causal relations of the phenomenal World. It is only with reference to the intra-cosmic soul, the idealKosmos in the immutable Divine Thought, that we may say: \"It never had a beginning nor will it have an end.\" With regard to its bodyor Cosmic organization, though it cannot be said that it had a first, or will ever have a last construction, yet at each new Manvantara,its organization may be regarded as the first and the last of its kind, as it evolutes every time on a higher plane . . . .A few years ago only, it was stated that:--\"The esoteric doctrine teaches, like Buddhism and Brahminism, and even the Kabala, that the one infinite and unknown Essenceexists from all eternity, and in regular and harmonious successions is either passive or active. In the poetical phraseology of Manuthese conditions are called the \"Days\" and the \"Nights\" of Brahma. The latter is either \"awake\" or \"asleep.\" The Svabhavikas, orphilosophers of the oldest school of Buddhism (which still exists in Nepaul), speculate only upon the active condition of this \"Essence,\"which they call Svabhavat, and deem it foolish to theorise upon the abstract and \"unknowable\" power in its passive condition. Hencethey are called atheists by both Christian theologians and modern scientists, for neither of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Nominalists, arguing with Berkeley that \"it is impossible . . . to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving\" (\"Prin.of Human Knowledge,\" Introd., par. 10), may put the question, \"What is that body, the producer of that motion?

The former will allow of no other God than the personifiedsecondary powers which have worked out the visible universe, and which became with them the anthropomorphic God of theChristians -- the male Jehovah, roaring amid thunder and lightning. In its turn, rationalistic science greets the Buddhists and theSvabhavikas as the \"positivists\" of the archaic ages. If we take a one-sided view of the philosophy of the latter, our materialists may beright in their own way. The Buddhists maintained that there is no Creator, but an infinitude of creative powers, which collectively formthe one eternal substance, the essence of which is inscrutable -- hence not a subject for speculation for any true philosopher. Socratesinvariably refused to argue upon the mystery of universal being, yet no one would ever have thought of charging him with atheism,except those who were bent upon his destruction. Upon inaugurating an active period, says the Secret Doctrine, an expansion of thisDivine essence from without inwardly and from within outwardly, occurs in obedience to eternal and immutable law, and thephenomenal or visible universe is the ultimate result of the long chain of cosmical forces thus progressively set in motion. In likemanner, when the passive condition is resumed, a contraction of the Divine essence takes place, and the previous work of creation isgradually and progressively undone. The visible universe becomes disintegrated, its material dispersed; and 'darkness' solitary andalone, broods once more over the face of the 'deep.' To use a Metaphor from the Secret Books, which will convey the idea still moreclearly, an out-breathing of the 'unknown essence' produces the world; and an inhalation causes it to disappear. This process has beengoing on from all eternity, and our present universe is but one of an infinite series, which had no beginning and will have no end.\" --(See \"Isis Unveiled\"; also \"The Days and Nights of Brahma\" in Part II.)This passage will be explained, as far as it is possible, in the present work. Though, as it now stands, it contains nothing new to theOrientalist, its esoteric interpretation may contain a good deal which has hitherto remained entirely unknown to the Western student.The first illustration being a plain disc [[diagram]] the second one in the Archaic symbol shows [[diagram]], a disc with a point in it --the first differentiation in the periodical manifestations of the ever-eternal nature, sexless and infinite \"Aditi in THAT\" (Rig Veda), thepoint in the disc, or potential Space within abstract Space. In its third stage the point is transformed into a diameter, thus [[diagram]] Itnow symbolises a divine immaculate Mother-Nature within the all-embracing absolute Infinitude.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 5 PROEM.When the diameter line is crossed by a vertical one [[diagram]], it becomes the mundane cross. Humanity has reached its third root-race; it is the sign for the origin of human life to begin. When the circumference disappears and leaves only the [[diagram]] it is a signthat the fall of man into matter is accomplished, and the FOURTH race begins. The Cross within a circle symbolises pure Pantheism;when the Cross was left uninscribed, it became phallic. It had the same and yet other meanings as a TAU inscribed within a circle[[diagram]] or as a \"Thor's hammer,\" the Jaina cross, so-called, or simply Svastica within a circle [[diagram]]"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"By the third symbol -- the circle divided in two by the horizontal line of the diameter -- the first manifestation of creative (still passive,because feminine) Nature was meant. The first shadowy perception of man connected with procreation is feminine, because manknows his mother more than his father. Hence female deities were more sacred than the male. Nature is therefore feminine, and, to adegree, objective and tangible, and the spirit Principle which fructifies it is concealed. By adding to the circle with the horizontal linein it, a perpendicular line, the tau was formed -- [[diagram]] -- the oldest form of the letter. It was the glyph of the third root-race to theday of its symbolical Fall -- i.e., when the separation of sexes by natural evolution took place -- when the figure became [[diagram]],the circle, or sexless life modified or separated -- a double glyph or symbol.

If not all of them philosophers, they are, at any rate,all logicians, their objections and arguments being based on strict reasoning. Indeed, if the Parabrahmam of the Hindus may be takenas a representative of the hidden and nameless deities of other nations, this absolute Principle will be found to be the prototype fromwhich all the others were copied. Parabrahm is not \"God,\" because It is not a God. \"It is that which is supreme, and not supreme(paravara),\" explains Mandukya Upanishad (2.28). IT is \"Supreme\" as CAUSE, not supreme as effect. Parabrahm is simply, as a\"Secondless Reality,\" the all-inclusive Kosmos -- or, rather, the infinite Cosmic Space -- in the highest spiritual sense, of course.Brahma (neuter) being the unchanging, pure, free, undecaying supreme Root, \"the ONE true Existence, Paramarthika,\" and theabsolute Chit and Chaitanya (intelligence, consciousness) cannot be a cogniser, \"for THAT can have no subject of cognition.\" Can theflame be called the essence of Fire? This Essence is \"the LIFE and LIGHT of the Universe, the visible fire and flame are destruction,death, and evil.\" \"Fire and Flame destroy the body of an Arhat, their essence makes him immortal.\" (Bodhi-mur, Book II.) \"Theknowledge of the absolute Spirit, like the effulgence of the sun, or like heat in fire, is naught else than the absolute Essence itself,\"says Sankaracharya. IT -- is \"the Spirit of the Fire,\" not fire itself; therefore, \"the attributes of the latter, heat or flame, are not theattributes of the Spirit, but of that of which that Spirit is the unconscious cause.\" Is not the above sentence the true key-note of laterRosicrucian[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We are told by the Western mathematicians and some American Kabalists, that in the Kabala also \"the value of the Jehovah nameis that of the diameter of a circle.\" Add to this the fact that Jehovah is the third Sephiroth, Binah, a feminine word, and you have thekey to the mystery. By certain Kabalistic transformations this name, androgynous in the first chapters of Genesis, becomes in itstransformations entirely masculine, Cainite and phallic. The fact of choosing a deity among the pagan gods and making of it aspecial national God, to call upon it as the \"One living God,\" the \"God of Gods,\" and then proclaim this worship Monotheistic, doesnot change it into the ONE Principle whose \"Unity admits not of multiplication, change, or form,\" especially in the case of a priapicdeity, as Jehovah now demonstrated to be.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 7 PROEM.philosophy? Parabrahm is, in short, the collective aggregate of Kosmos in its infinity and eternity, the \"THAT\" and \"THIS\" to whichdistributive aggregates can not be applied.* \"In the beginning THIS was the Self, one only\" (Aitareya Upanishad); the greatSankaracharya, explains that \"THIS\" referred to the Universe (Jagat); the sense of the words, \"In the beginning,\" meaning before thereproduction of the phenomenal Universe.Therefore, when the Pantheists echo the Upanishads, which state, as in the Secret Doctrine, that \"this\" cannot create, they do notdeny a Creator, or rather a collective aggregate of creators, but only refuse, very logically, to attribute \"creation\" and especiallyformation, something finite to an Infinite Principle. With them, Parabrahmam is a passive because an Absolute Cause, theunconditioned Mukta. It is only limited Omniscience and Omnipotence that are refused to the latter, because these are still attributes(as reflected in man's perceptions); and because Parabrahm, being the \"Supreme ALL,\" the ever invisible spirit and Soul of Nature,changeless and eternal, can have no attributes; absoluteness very naturally precluding any idea of the finite or conditioned frombeing connected with it. And if the Vedantin postulates attributes as belonging simply to its emanation, calling it \"Iswara plus Maya,\"and Avidya (Agnosticism and Nescience rather than ignorance), it is difficult to find any Atheism in this conception.** Since there canbe neither two INFINITES nor two ABSOLUTES in a Universe supposed to be Boundless, this Self-Existence can hardly be conceivedof as creating personally. In the sense and perceptions of finite \"Beings,\" THAT is Non-\"being,\" in the sense that it is the one BE-NESS; for, in this ALL lies concealed its coeternal and coeval emanation or inherent radiation, which, upon becoming periodically"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Brahma (the male-female Potency) becomes or expands itself into the manifested Universe.

Yet, no philosopher among them will view this \"death\"in any other sense than as a temporary disappearance from the manifested plane of existence, or as a periodical rest.The Occultists are, therefore, at one with the Adwaita Vedantin philosophers as to the above tenet. They show the impossibility ofaccepting on philosophical grounds the idea of the absolute ALL creating or even evolving the \"Golden Egg,\" into which it is said toenter in order to transform itself into Brahma -- the Creator, who expands himself later into gods and all the visible Universe. They saythat Absolute Unity cannot pass to infinity; for infinity presupposes the limitless extension of something, and the duration of that\"something\"; and the One All is like Space -- which is its only mental and physical representation on this Earth, or our plane ofexistence -- neither an object of, nor a subject to, perception. If one could suppose the Eternal Infinite All, the Omnipresent Unity,instead of being in Eternity, becoming through periodical manifestation a manifold Universe or a multiple personality, that Unitywould cease to be one. Locke's idea that \"pure Space is capable of neither resistance nor Motion\" -- is incorrect. Space is neither a\"limitless void,\" nor a \"conditioned fulness,\" but both: being, on the plane of absolute abstraction, the ever-incognisable Deity, whichis void only to finite minds,* and on that of mayavic perception, the Plenum, the absolute Container of all that is, whether manifestedor unmanifested: it is, therefore, that ABSOLUTE ALL. There is no difference between the Christian Apostle's \"In Him we live andmove and have our being,\" and the Hindu Rishi's \"The Universe lives in, proceeds from, and will[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The very names of the two chief deities, Brahma and Vishnu, ought to have long ago suggested their esoteric meanings.

And the answer made is -- SPACE.It is not the One Unknown ever-present God in Nature, or Nature in abscondito, that is rejected, but the God of human dogma and hishumanized \"Word.\" In his infinite conceit and inherent pride and vanity, man shaped it himself with his sacrilegious hand out of thematerial he found in his own small brain-fabric, and forced it upon mankind as a direct revelation from the one unrevealed SPACE.**The Occultist[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Manu's account of Brahma separating his body into male and female, the latter the female Vach, in whom he creates Viraj,and compare this with the esotericism of Chapters II., III., and IV. of Genesis.** Occultism is indeed in the air at the close of this our century. Among many other works recently published, we would recommendone especially to students of theoretical Occultism who would not venture beyond the realm of our special human plane. It is called\"New Aspects of Life and Religion,\" by Henry Pratt, M.D. It is full of esoteric dogmas and philosophy, the latter rather limited, in theconcluding chapters, by what seems to be a spirit of conditioned positivism. Nevertheless, what is said of Space as \"the Unknown FirstCause,\" merits quotation. \"This unknown something, thus recognised as, and identified with, the primary embodiment of SimpleUnity, is invisible and impalpable\" -- (abstract space, granted); \"and because invisible and impalpable, therefore incognisable. And"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"this incognisability has led to the error of supposing it to be a simple void, a mere receptive capacity. But, even viewed as an absolutevoid, space must be admitted to be either Self-existent, infinite, and eternal, or to have had a first cause outside, behind, and beyonditself.\"And yet could such a cause be found and defined, this would only lead to the transferring thereto of the attributes otherwise accruingto space, and thus merely throw the difficulty of origination a step farther back, without gaining additional light as to primarycausation.\" (p. 5.)This is precisely what has been done by the believers in an anthropomorphic Creator, an extracosmic, instead of an intracosmic God.Many -- most of Mr. Pratt's subjects, we may say -- are old Kabalistic ideas and theories which he presents in quite a new garb: \"NewAspects\" of the Occult in Nature, indeed. Space, however, viewed as a \"Substantial Unity\" -- the \"living Source of Life\" -- is as the \"Un-[[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 10 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.accepts revelation as coming from divine yet still finite Beings, the manifested lives, never from the Unmanifestable ONE LIFE; fromthose entities, called Primordial Man, Dhyani-Buddhas, or Dhyan-Chohans, the \"Rishi-Prajapati\" of the Hindus, the Elohim or \"Sons ofGod,\" the Planetary Spirits of all nations, who have become Gods for men. He also regards the Adi-Sakti -- the direct emanation ofMulaprakriti, the eternal Root of THAT, and the female aspect of the Creative Cause Brahma, in her A'kasic form of the Universal Soul-- as philosophically a Maya, and cause of human Maya. But this view does not prevent him from believing in its existence so long asit lasts, to wit, for one Mahamanvantara; nor from applying Akasa, the radiation of Mulaprakriti,* to practical purposes, connected asthe World-Soul is with all natural phenomena, known or unknown to science.The oldest religions of the world -- exoterically, for the esoteric root or foundation is one -- are the Indian, the Mazdean, and theEgyptian. Then comes the Chaldean, the outcome of these -- entirely lost to the world now, except in its disfigured Sabeanism as atpresent rendered by the archaeologists; then, passing over a number of religions that will be mentioned later, comes the Jewish,esoterically, as in the Kabala, following in the line of Babylonian Magism; exoterically, as in Genesis and the Pentateuch, acollection of allegorical legends.

Matteris dual in religious metaphysics, and septenary in esoteric teachings, like everything else in the universe. As Mulaprakriti, it isundifferentiated and eternal; as Vyakta, it becomes differentiated and conditioned, according to Svetasvatara Upanishad, I. 8, andDevi Bhagavata Purana. The author of the Four Lectures on the Bhagavad Gita, says, in speaking of Mulaprakriti: \"From its (theLogos') objective standpoint, Parabrahmam appears to it as Mulaprakriti. . . . Of course this Mulaprakriti is material to it, as anymaterial object is material to us. . . .

To have let them serve asa prologue to Christianity was a cruel revenge on the part of the Rabbis, who knew better what their Pentateuch meant. It was a silentprotest against their spoliation, and the Jews have certainly now the better of their traditional persecutors. The above-named exotericcreeds will be explained in the light of the Universal doctrine as we proceed with it.The Occult Catechism contains the following questions and answers:\"What is it that ever is?\" \"Space, the eternal Anupadaka.\"* \"What is it that ever was?\" \"The Germ in the Root.\" \"What is it that is evercoming and going?\" \"The Great Breath.\" \"Then, there are three Eternals?\" \"No, the three are one.

The remaining two are as yet absolutely beyond the range ofhuman perception. These latter will, however, appear as presentments during the 6th and 7th Races of this Round, and will becomeknown in the 6th and 7th Rounds respectively.* These seven elements with their numberless Sub-Elements[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] from within outwardly, every atom being said to contain in itself creative energy of thedivine breath.

Had Mr.Herbert Spencer read and studied ancient Hindu philosophers when he wrote a certain passage in his \"First Principles\" (p. 482), or is itan independent flash of inner perception that made him say half correctly, half incorrectly, \"motion as well as matter, being fixed inquantity (?), it would seem that the change in the distribution of Matter which Motion effects, coming to a limit in whichever directionit is carried (?), the indestructible Motion thereupon necessitates a reverse distribution. Apparently, the universally co-existent forces ofattraction and repulsion which, as we have seen, necessitate rhythm in all minor changes throughout the Universe, also necessitaterhythm in the totality of its changes -- produce now an immeasurable period during which the attracting forces predominating, causeuniversal concentration, and then an immeasurable period, during which the repulsive forces predominating, cause universal diffusion-- alternate eras of Evolution and dissolution.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 13 PROEM.far more numerous than those known to Science) are simply conditional modifications and aspects of the ONE and only Element. Thislatter is not Ether,* not even A'kasa but the Source of these. The Fifth Element, now advocated quite freely by Science, is not theEther hypothesised by Sir Isaac Newton -- although he calls it by that name, having associated it in his mind probably with the AEther,\"Father-Mother\" of Antiquity. As Newton intuitionally says, \"Nature is a perpetual circulatory worker, generating fluids out of solids,fixed things out of volatile, and volatile out of fixed, subtile out of gross, and gross out of subtile. . . . . Thus, perhaps, may all thingsbe originated from Ether,\" (Hypoth, 1675).The reader has to bear in mind that the Stanzas given treat only of the Cosmogony of our own planetary System and what is visiblearound it, after a Solar Pralaya. The secret teachings with regard to the Evolution of the Universal Kosmos cannot be given, sincethey could not be understood by the highest minds in this age, and there seem to be very few Initiates, even among the greatest, whoare allowed to speculate upon this subject. Moreover the Teachers say openly that not even the highest Dhyani-Chohans have everpenetrated the mysteries beyond those boundaries that separate the milliards of Solar systems from the \"Central Sun,\" as it is called.Therefore, that which is given, relates only to our visible Kosmos, after a \"Night of Brahma.\"Before the reader proceeds to the consideration of the Stanzas from the Book of Dzyan which form the basis of the present work, it isabsolutely necessary that he should be made acquainted with the few fundamental conceptions which underlie and pervade theentire system of thought to which his attention is invited. These basic ideas are few in number, and on their clear apprehension"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"depends the understanding of all that follows; therefore no apology is required for asking the reader to make himself familiar withthem first, before entering on the perusal of the work itself.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Whatever the views of physical Science upon the subject, Occult Science has been teaching for ages that A'kasa -- of which Ether isthe grossest form -- the fifth universal Cosmic Principle (to which corresponds and from which proceeds human Manas) is, cosmically, aradiant, cool, diathermanous plastic matter, creative in its physical nature, correlative in its grossest aspects and portions, immutablein its higher principles. In the former condition it is called the Sub-Root; and in conjunction with radiant heat, it recalls \"dead worldsto life.\" In its higher aspect it is the Soul of the World; in its lower -- the DESTROYER.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 14 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The Secret Doctrine establishes three fundamental propositions:--(a) An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable PRINCIPLE on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends thepower of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude. It is beyond the range and reach ofthought -- in the words of Mandukya, \"unthinkable and unspeakable.\"To render these ideas clearer to the general reader, let him set out with the postulate that there is one absolute Reality whichantecedes all manifested, conditioned, being. This Infinite and Eternal Cause -- dimly formulated in the \"Unconscious\" and\"Unknowable\" of current European philosophy -- is the rootless root of \"all that was, is, or ever shall be.\" It is of course devoid of allattributes and is essentially without any relation to manifested, finite Being. It is \"Be-ness\" rather than Being (in Sanskrit, Sat), and isbeyond all thought or speculation.This \"Be-ness\" is symbolised in the Secret Doctrine under two aspects. On the one hand, absolute abstract Space, representing baresubjectivity, the one thing which no human mind can either exclude from any conception, or conceive of by itself. On the other,absolute Abstract Motion representing Unconditioned Consciousness. Even our Western thinkers have shown that Consciousness isinconceivable to us apart from change, and motion best symbolises change, its essential characteristic. This latter aspect of the oneReality, is also symbolised by the term \"The Great Breath,\" a symbol sufficiently graphic to need no further elucidation. Thus, then,the first fundamental axiom of the Secret Doctrine is this metaphysical ONE ABSOLUTE -- BE-NESS -- symbolised by finiteintelligence as the theological Trinity.It may, however, assist the student if a few further explanations are given here.Herbert Spencer has of late so far modified his Agnosticism, as to assert that the nature of the \"First Cause,\"* which the Occultist morelogically derives from the \"Causeless Cause,\" the \"Eternal,\" and the \"Unknowable,\" may be essentially the same as that of theConsciousness which wells up within us: in short, that the impersonal reality pervading[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The \"first\" presupposes necessarily something which is the \"first brought forth, the first in time, space, and rank\" -- and therefore finiteand conditioned. The \"first\" [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 15 PROEM.the Kosmos is the pure noumenon of thought. This advance on his part brings him very near to the esoteric and Vedantin tenet.*Parabrahm (the One Reality, the Absolute) is the field of Absolute Consciousness, i.e., that Essence which is out of all relation toconditioned existence, and of which conscious existence is a conditioned symbol. But once that we pass in thought from this (to us)Absolute Negation, duality supervenes in the contrast of Spirit (or consciousness) and Matter, Subject and Object.Spirit (or Consciousness) and Matter are, however, to be regarded, not as independent realities, but as the two facets or aspects of theAbsolute (Parabrahm), which constitute the basis of conditioned Being whether subjective or objective.Considering this metaphysical triad as the Root from which proceeds all manifestation, the great Breath assumes the character ofprecosmic Ideation. It is the fons et origo of force and of all individual consciousness, and supplies the guiding intelligence in the vastscheme of cosmic Evolution. On the other hand, precosmic root-substance (Mulaprakriti) is that aspect of the Absolute which underliesall the objective planes of Nature.Just as pre-Cosmic Ideation is the root of all individual consciousness, so pre-Cosmic Substance is the substratum of matter in thevarious grades of its differentiation.Hence it will be apparent that the contrast of these two aspects of the Absolute is essential to the existence of the \"ManifestedUniverse.\" Apart from Cosmic Substance, Cosmic Ideation could not manifest as individual consciousness, since it is only through avehicle** of matter that consciousness wells up as \"I am I,\" a physical basis being necessary to focus a ray of the Universal Mind at a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"certain stage of complexity. Again, apart from Cosmic Ideation, Cosmic Substance would remain an empty abstraction, and noemergence of consciousness could ensue.The \"Manifested Universe,\" therefore, is pervaded by duality, which is, as it were, the very essence of its EX-istence as \"manifestation.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] cannot be the absolute, for it is a manifestation. Therefore, Eastern Occultism calls theAbstract All the \"Causeless One Cause,\" the \"Rootless Root,\" and limits the \"First Cause\" to the Logos, in the sense that Plato gives tothis term.* See Mr. Subba Row's four able lectures on the Bhagavad Gita, \"Theosophist,\" February, 1887.** Called in Sanskrit: \"Upadhi.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 16 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.But just as the opposite poles of subject and object, spirit and matter, are but aspects of the One Unity in which they are synthesized,so, in the manifested Universe, there is \"that\" which links spirit to matter, subject to object.This something, at present unknown to Western speculation, is called by the occultists Fohat. It is the \"bridge\" by which the \"Ideas\"existing in the \"Divine Thought\" are impressed on Cosmic substance as the \"laws of Nature.\" Fohat is thus the dynamic energy ofCosmic Ideation; or, regarded from the other side, it is the intelligent medium, the guiding power of all manifestation, the \"ThoughtDivine\" transmitted and made manifest through the Dhyan Chohans,* the Architects of the visible World. Thus from Spirit, or CosmicIdeation, comes our consciousness; from Cosmic Substance the several vehicles in which that consciousness is individualised andattains to self -- or reflective -- consciousness; while Fohat, in its various manifestations, is the mysterious link between Mind andMatter, the animating principle electrifying every atom into life.The following summary will afford a clearer idea to the reader.(1.) The ABSOLUTE; the Parabrahm of the Vedantins or the one Reality, SAT, which is, as Hegel says, both Absolute Being and Non-Being.(2.) The first manifestation, the impersonal, and, in philosophy, unmanifested Logos, the precursor of the \"manifested.\" This is the\"First Cause,\" the \"Unconscious\" of European Pantheists.(3.) Spirit-matter, LIFE; the \"Spirit of the Universe,\" the Purusha and Prakriti, or the second Logos.(4.) Cosmic Ideation, MAHAT or Intelligence, the Universal World-Soul; the Cosmic Noumenon of Matter, the basis of the intelligentoperations in and of Nature, also called MAHA-BUDDHI.The ONE REALITY; its dual aspects in the conditioned Universe.Further, the Secret Doctrine affirms:--(b.) The Eternity of the Universe in toto as a boundless plane; periodically \"the playground of numberless Universes incessantlymanifesting and disappearing,\" called \"the manifesting stars,\" and the \"sparks of Eternity.\" \"The Eternity of the Pilgrim\"** is like a wink[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Called by Christian theology: Archangels, Seraphs, etc., etc.** \"Pilgrim\" is the appellation given to our Monad (the two in one) during its cycle of incarnations. It is the only immortal and eternalprinciple in us, being an indivisible part of the integral whole -- the Universal Spirit, from which it emanates, and into which it isabsorbed at the end of the cycle. When it is said to emanate from the one [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 17 PROEM.of the Eye of Self-Existence (Book of Dzyan.) \"The appearance and disappearance of Worlds is like a regular tidal ebb of flux andreflux.\" (See Part II., \"Days and Nights of Brahma.\")This second assertion of the Secret Doctrine is the absolute universality of that law of periodicity, of flux and reflux, ebb and flow,which physical science has observed and recorded in all departments of nature. An alternation such as that of Day and Night, Life andDeath, Sleeping and Waking, is a fact so common, so perfectly universal and without exception, that it is easy to comprehend that init we see one of the absolutely fundamental laws of the universe."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Moreover, the Secret Doctrine teaches:--(c) The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over-Soul, the latter being itself an aspect of the Unknown Root; and theobligatory pilgrimage for every Soul -- a spark of the former -- through the Cycle of Incarnation (or \"Necessity\") in accordance withCyclic and Karmic law, during the whole term. In other words, no purely spiritual Buddhi (divine Soul) can have an independent(conscious) existence before the spark which issued from the pure Essence of the Universal Sixth principle, -- or the OVER-SOUL, -- has(a) passed through every elemental form of the phenomenal world of that Manvantara, and (b) acquired individuality, first by naturalimpulse, and then by self-induced and self-devised efforts (checked by its Karma), thus ascending through all the degrees ofintelligence, from the lowest to the highest Manas, from mineral and plant, up to the holiest archangel (Dhyani-Buddha). The pivotaldoctrine of the Esoteric philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts in man, save those won by his own Ego through personal effortand merit throughout a long series of metempsychoses and reincarnations. This is why the Hindus say that the Universe is Brahma andBrahmâ, for Brahma is in every atom of the universe, the six principles in Nature being all the outcome -- the variously differentiatedaspects -- of the SEVENTH and ONE, the only reality in the Universe whether Cosmical or micro-cosmical; and also why thepermutations (psychic, spiritual and physical), on the plane of manifestation and form, of the sixth (Brahmâ the vehicle of Brahma) areviewed by metaphysical[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] spirit, an awkward and incorrect expression has to be used, for lack of appropriate words inEnglish. The Vedantins call it Sutratma (Thread-Soul), but their explanation, too, differs somewhat from that of the occultists; toexplain which difference, however, is left to the Vedantins themselves.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 18 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.antiphrasis as illusive and Mayavic. For although the root of every atom individually and of every form collectively, is that seventhprinciple or the one Reality, still, in its manifested phenomenal and temporary appearance, it is no better than an evanescent illusionof our senses. (See, for clearer definition, Addendum \"Gods, Monads and Atoms,\" and also \"Theophania,\" \"Bodhisatvas andReincarnation,\" etc., etc.)In its absoluteness, the One Principle under its two aspects (of Parabrahmam and Mulaprakriti) is sexless, unconditioned and eternal.Its periodical (manvantaric) emanation -- or primal radiation -- is also One, androgynous and phenomenally finite. When the radiationradiates in its turn, all its radiations are also androgynous, to become male and female principles in their lower aspects. After Pralaya,whether the great or the minor Pralaya (the latter leaving the worlds in statu quo*), the first that re-awakes to active life is the plasticA'kasa, Father-Mother, the Spirit and Soul of Ether, or the plane on the surface of the Circle. Space is called the \"Mother\" before itsCosmic activity, and Father-Mother at the first stage of re-awakening. (See Comments, Stanza II.) In the Kabala it is also Father-Mother-Son. But whereas in the Eastern doctrine, these are the Seventh Principle of the manifested Universe, or its \"Atma-Buddhi-Manas\" (Spirit, Soul, Intelligence), the triad branching off and dividing into the seven cosmical and seven human principles, in theWestern Kabala of the Christian mystics it is the Triad or Trinity, and with their occultists, the male-female Jehovah, Jah-Havah. In thislies the whole difference between the esoteric and the Christian trinities. The Mystics and the Philosophers, the Eastern and WesternPantheists, synthesize their pregenetic triad in the pure divine abstraction. The orthodox, anthropomorphize it. Hiranyagarbha, Hari,and Sankara -- the three hypostases of the manifesting \"Spirit of the Supreme Spirit\" (by which title Prithivi -- the Earth -- greetsVishnu in his first Avatar) -- are the purely metaphysical abstract qualities of formation, preservation, and destruction, and are the threedivine Avasthas (lit. hypostases) of that which \"does[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is not the physical organisms that remain in statu quo, least of all their psychical principles, during the great Cosmic or even Solarpralayas, but only their Akasic or astral \"photographs.\" But during the minor pralayas, once over-taken by the \"Night,\" the planetsremain intact, though dead, as a huge animal, caught and embedded in the polar ice, remains the same for ages.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 19 PROEM.not perish with created things\" (or Achyuta, a name of Vishnu); whereas the orthodox Christian separates his personal creative Deityinto the three personages of the Trinity, and admits of no higher Deity. The latter, in Occultism, is the abstract Triangle; with theorthodox, the perfect Cube. The creative god or the aggregate gods are regarded by the Eastern philosopher as Bhrantidarsanatah --\"false apprehension,\" something \"conceived of, by reason of erroneous appearances, as a material form,\" and explained as arisingfrom the illusive conception of the Egotistic personal and human Soul (lower fifth principle). It is beautifully expressed in a newtranslation of Vishnu Purana. \"That Brahma in its totality has essentially the aspect of Prakriti, both evolved and unevolved(Mulaprakriti), and also the aspect of Spirit and the aspect of Time. Spirit, O twice born, is the leading aspect of the SupremeBrahma.* The next is a twofold aspect, -- Prakriti, both evolved and unevolved, and is the time last.\" Kronos is shown in the Orphictheogony as being also a generated god or agent.At this stage of the re-awakening of the Universe, the sacred symbolism represents it as a perfect Circle with the (root) point in theCentre. This sign was universal, therefore we find it in the Kabala also. The Western Kabala, however, now in the hands of Christianmystics, ignores it altogether, though it is plainly shown in the Zohar. These sectarians begin at the end, and show as the symbol of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"pregenetic Kosmos this sign [[diagram]], calling it \"the Union of the Rose and Cross,\" the great mystery of occult generation, fromwhence the name -- Rosicrucians (Rose Cross)!As may be judged, however, from the most important, as the best known of the Rosicrucians' symbols, there is one which has neverbeen hitherto understood even by modern mystics. It is that of the \"Pelican\" tearing open its breast to feed its seven little ones -- thereal creed of the Brothers of the Rosie-Cross and a direct outcome from the Eastern[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Thus Spencer, who, nevertheless, like Schopenhauer and von Hartmann, only reflects an aspect of the old esoteric philosophers,and hence lands his readers on the bleak shore of Agnostic despair -- reverently formulates the grand mystery; \"that which persistsunchanging in quantity, but ever changing in form, under these sensible appearances which the Universe presents to us, is anunknown and unknowable power, which we are obliged to recognise as without limit in Space and without beginning or end in time.\"It is only daring Theology -- never Science or philosophy -- which seeks to gauge the Infinite and unveil the Fathomless andUnknowable.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 20 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Secret Doctrine. Brahma (neuter) is called Kalahansa, meaning, as explained by Western Orientalists, the Eternal Swan or goose (seeStanza III., Comment. 8), and so is Brahma, the Creator. A great mistake is thus brought under notice; it is Brahma (neuter) who oughtto be referred to as Hansa-vahana (He who uses the swan as his Vehicle) and not Brahma the Creator, who is the real Kalahansa,while Brahma (neuter) is hamsa, and \"A-hamsa,\" as will be explained in the Commentary. Let it be understood that the terms Brahmaand Parabrahmam are not used here because they belong to our Esoteric nomenclature, but simply because they are more familiar tothe students in the West. Both are the perfect equivalents of our one, three, and seven vowelled terms, which stand for the ONE ALL,and the One \"All in all.\"Such are the basic conceptions on which the Secret Doctrine rests.It would not be in place here to enter upon any defence or proof of their inherent reasonableness; nor can I pause to show how theyare, in fact, contained -- though too often under a misleading guise -- in every system of thought or philosophy worthy of the name.Once that the reader has gained a clear comprehension of them and realised the light which they throw on every problem of life, theywill need no further justification in his eyes, because their truth will be to him as evident as the sun in heaven. I pass on, therefore, tothe subject matter of the Stanzas as given in this volume, adding a skeleton outline of them, in the hope of thereby rendering the taskof the student more easy, by placing before him in a few words the general conception therein explained.Stanza I. The history of cosmic evolution, as traced in the Stanzas, is, so to say, the abstract algebraical formula of that Evolution.Hence the student must not expect to find there an account of all the stages and transformations which intervene between the firstbeginnings of \"Universal\" evolution and our present state. To give such an account would be as impossible as it would beincomprehensible to men who cannot even grasp the nature of the plane of existence next to that to which, for the moment, theirconsciousness is limited.The Stanzas, therefore, give an abstract formula which can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to all evolution: to that of our tiny earth, to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 21 PROEM.that of the chain of planets of which that earth forms one, to the solar Universe to which that chain belongs, and so on, in anascending scale, till the mind reels and is exhausted in the effort.The seven Stanzas given in this volume represent the seven terms of this abstract formula. They refer to, and describe the seven greatstages of the evolutionary process, which are spoken of in the Puranas as the \"Seven Creations,\" and in the Bible as the \"Days\" ofCreation.---------------------The First Stanza describes the state of the ONE ALL during Pralaya, before the first flutter of re-awakening manifestation.A moment's thought shows that such a state can only be symbolised; to describe it is impossible. Nor can it be symbolised except innegatives; for, since it is the state of Absoluteness per se, it can possess none of those specific attributes which serve us to describeobjects in positive terms. Hence that state can only be suggested by the negatives of all those most abstract attributes which men feelrather than conceive, as the remotest limits attainable by their power of conception.The stage described in Stanza II. is, to a western mind, so nearly identical with that mentioned in the first Stanza, that to express theidea of its difference would require a treatise in itself. Hence it must be left to the intuition and the higher faculties of the reader tograsp, as far as he can, the meaning of the allegorical phrases used. Indeed it must be remembered that all these Stanzas appeal tothe inner faculties rather than to the ordinary comprehension of the physical brain."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Stanza III. describes the Re-awakening of the Universe to life after Pralaya. It depicts the emergence of the \"Monads\" from their stateof absorption within the ONE; the earliest and highest stage in the formation of \"Worlds,\" the term Monad being one which may applyequally to the vastest Solar System or the tiniest atom.Stanza IV. shows the differentiation of the \"Germ\" of the Universe------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 22 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.into the septenary hierarchy of conscious Divine Powers, who are the active manifestations of the One Supreme Energy. They are theframers, shapers, and ultimately the creators of all the manifested Universe, in the only sense in which the name \"Creator\" isintelligible; they inform and guide it; they are the intelligent Beings who adjust and control evolution, embodying in themselvesthose manifestations of the ONE LAW, which we know as \"The Laws of Nature.\"Generically, they are known as the Dhyan Chohans, though each of the various groups has its own designation in the Secret Doctrine.This stage of evolution is spoken of in Hindu mythology as the \"Creation\" of the Gods.In Stanza V. the process of world-formation is described:--- First, diffused Cosmic Matter, then the fiery \"whirlwind,\" the first stage in theformation of a nebula. That nebula condenses, and after passing through various transformations, forms a Solar Universe, a planetarychain, or a single planet, as the case may be.The subsequent stages in the formation of a \"World\" are indicated in Stanza VI., which brings the evolution of such a world down toits fourth great period, corresponding to the period in which we are now living.Stanza VII. continues the history, tracing the descent of life down to the appearance of Man; and thus closes the first Book of theSecret Doctrine.The development of \"Man\" from his first appearance on this earth in this Round to the state in which we now find him will form thesubject of Book II.---------------------NOTE.The Stanzas which form the thesis of every section are given throughout in their modern translated version, as it would be worse------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 23 PROEM.than useless to make the subject still more difficult by introducing the archaic phraseology of the original, with its puzzling style andwords. Extracts are given from the Chinese Thibetan and Sanskrit translations of the original Senzar Commentaries and Glosses onthe Book of DZYAN -- these being now rendered for the first time into a European language. It is almost unnecessary to state that onlyportions of the seven Stanzas are here given. Were they published complete they would remain incomprehensible to all save the fewhigher occultists. Nor is there any need to assure the reader that, no more than most of the profane, does the writer, or rather thehumble recorder, understand those forbidden passages. To facilitate the reading, and to avoid the too frequent reference to foot-notes, it was thought best to blend together texts and glosses, using the Sanskrit and Tibetan proper names whenever those cannot beavoided, in preference to giving the originals. The more so as the said terms are all accepted synonyms, the former only being usedbetween a Master and his chelas (or disciples).Thus, were one to translate into English, using only the substantives and technical terms as employed in one of the Tibetan andSenzar versions, Verse I would read as follows:--- \"Tho-ag in Zhi-gyu slept seven Khorlo. Zodmanas zhiba. All Nyug bosom. Konch-hognot; Thyan-Kam not; Lha-Chohan not; Tenbrel Chugnyi not; Dharmakaya ceased; Tgenchang not become; Barnang and Ssa inNgovonyidj; alone Tho-og Yinsin in night of Sun-chan and Yong-grub (Parinishpanna), &c., &c.,\" which would sound like pureAbracadabra.As this work is written for the instruction of students of Occultism, and not for the benefit of philologists, we may well avoid such foreignterms wherever it is possible to do so. The untranslateable terms alone, incomprehensible unless explained in their meanings, areleft, but all such terms are rendered in their Sanskrit form. Needless to remind the reader that these are, in almost every case, the latedevelopments of the later language, and pertain to the Fifth Root-Race. Sanskrit, as now known, was not spoken by the Atlanteans,and most of the philosophical terms used in the systems of the India of the post-Mahabharatan period are not found in the Vedas, norare they to be met with in the original Stanzas, but only their equivalents. The reader who is not a Theosophist, is once more invitedto regard all that which follows as a fairy tale, if he likes; at best as one of the yet unproven speculations of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 24 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"dreamers; and, at the worst, as an additional hypothesis to the many Scientific hypotheses past, present and future, some exploded,others still lingering.

Space is the one eternal thing that we can most easily imagine, immovable in its abstractionand uninfluenced by either the presence or absence in it of an objective Universe. It is without dimension, in every sense, and self-existent. Spirit is the first differentiation from THAT, the causeless cause of both Spirit and Matter. It is, as taught in the esotericcatechism, neither limitless void, nor conditioned fulness, but both. It was and ever will be. (See Proem pp. 2 et seq.)Thus, the \"Robes\" stand for the noumenon of undifferentiated Cosmic Matter. It is not matter as we know it, but the spiritual essence ofmatter, and is co-eternal and even one with Space in its abstract sense. Root-nature is also the source of the subtile invisibleproperties in visible matter. It is the Soul, so to say, of the ONE infinite Spirit. The Hindus call it Mulaprakriti, and say that it is theprimordial substance, which is the basis of the Upadhi or vehicle of every phenomenon, whether physical, mental or psychic. It is thesource from which Akasa radiates.(a) By the Seven \"Eternities,\" aeons or periods are meant. The word \"Eternity,\" as understood in Christian theology, has no meaningto the Asiatic ear, except in its application to the ONE existence; nor is------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 36 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the term sempiternity, the eternal only in futurity, anything better than a misnomer.* Such words do not and cannot exist inphilosophical metaphysics, and were unknown till the advent of ecclesiastical Christianity. The Seven Eternities meant are the sevenperiods, or a period answering in its duration to the seven periods, of a Manvantara, and extending throughout a Maha-Kalpa or the\"Great Age\" -- 100 years of Brahma -- making a total of 311,040,000,000,000 of years; each year of Brahma being composed of 360\"days,\" and of the same number of \"nights\" of Brahma (reckoning by the Chandrayana or lunar year); and a \"Day of Brahma\"consisting of 4,320,000,000 of mortal years. These \"Eternities\" belong to the most secret calculations, in which, in order to arrive atthe true total, every figure must be 7x (7 to the power of x); x varying according to the nature of the cycle in the subjective or realworld; and every figure or number relating to, or representing all the different cycles from the greatest to the smallest -- in theobjective or unreal world -- must necessarily be multiples of seven. The key to this cannot be given, for herein lies the mystery ofesoteric calculations, and for the purposes of ordinary calculation it has no sense. \"The number seven,\" says the Kabala, \"is the greatnumber of the Divine Mysteries;\" number ten is that of all human knowledge (Pythagorean decade); 1,000 is the number ten to thethird power, and therefore the number 7,000 is also symbolical. In the Secret Doctrine the figure and number 4 are the male symbolonly on the highest plane of abstraction; on the plane of matter the 3 is the masculine and the 4 the female: the upright and thehorizontal in the fourth stage of symbolism, when the symbols became the glyphs of the generative powers on the physical plane.-------STANZA I. -- Continued.2. TIME WAS NOT, FOR IT LAY ASLEEP IN THE INFINITE BOSOM OF DURATION (a).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is stated in Book II., ch. viii., of Vishnu Purana: \"By immortality is meant existence to the end of the Kalpa;\" and Wilson, thetranslator, remarks in a footnote: \"This, according to the Vedas, is all that is to be understood of the immortality (or eternity) of thegods; they perish at the end of universal dissolution (or Pralaya).\" And Esoteric philosophy says: They \"perish\" not, but are re-absorbed.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 37 TIME AND UNIVERSAL MIND."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"(a) Time is only an illusion produced by the succession of our states of consciousness as we travel through eternal duration, and itdoes not exist where no consciousness exists in which the illusion can be produced; but \"lies asleep.\" The present is only amathematical line which divides that part of eternal duration which we call the future, from that part which we call the past. Nothingon earth has real duration, for nothing remains without change -- or the same -- for the billionth part of a second; and the sensation wehave of the actuality of the division of \"time\" known as the present, comes from the blurring of that momentary glimpse, or successionof glimpses, of things that our senses give us, as those things pass from the region of ideals which we call the future, to the region ofmemories that we name the past. In the same way we experience a sensation of duration in the case of the instantaneous electricspark, by reason of the blurred and continuing impression on the retina. The real person or thing does not consist solely of what isseen at any particular moment, but is composed of the sum of all its various and changing conditions from its appearance in thematerial form to its disappearance from the earth. It is these \"sum-totals\" that exist from eternity in the \"future,\" and pass by degreesthrough matter, to exist for eternity in the \"past.\" No one could say that a bar of metal dropped into the sea came into existence as itleft the air, and ceased to exist as it entered the water, and that the bar itself consisted only of that cross-section thereof which at anygiven moment coincided with the mathematical plane that separates, and, at the same time, joins, the atmosphere and the ocean.Even so of persons and things, which, dropping out of the to-be into the has-been, out of the future into the past -- presentmomentarily to our senses a cross-section, as it were, of their total selves, as they pass through time and space (as matter) on their wayfrom one eternity to another: and these two constitute that \"duration\" in which alone anything has true existence, were our senses butable to cognize it there.-------STANZA I. -- Continued.3. . . . UNIVERSAL MIND WAS NOT, FOR THERE WERE NO AH-HI (celestial beings) TO CONTAIN (hence to manifest) IT (a).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 38 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(a) Mind is a name given to the sum of the states of Consciousness grouped under Thought, Will, and Feeling. During deep sleep,ideation ceases on the physical plane, and memory is in abeyance; thus for the time-being \"Mind is not,\" because the organ, throughwhich the Ego manifests ideation and memory on the material plane, has temporarily ceased to function. A noumenon can become aphenomenon on any plane of existence only by manifesting on that plane through an appropriate basis or vehicle; and during thelong night of rest called Pralaya, when all the existences are dissolved, the \"UNIVERSAL MIND\" remains as a permanent possibility ofmental action, or as that abstract absolute thought, of which mind is the concrete relative manifestation. The AH-HI (Dhyan-Chohans)are the collective hosts of spiritual beings -- the Angelic Hosts of Christianity, the Elohim and \"Messengers\" of the Jews -- who are thevehicle for the manifestation of the divine or universal thought and will. They are the Intelligent Forces that give to and enact inNature her \"laws,\" while themselves acting according to laws imposed upon them in a similar manner by still higher Powers; but theyare not \"the personifications\" of the powers of Nature, as erroneously thought. This hierarchy of spiritual Beings, through which theUniversal Mind comes into action, is like an army -- a \"Host,\" truly -- by means of which the fighting power of a nation manifests itself,and which is composed of army corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and so forth, each with its separate individuality or life, and itslimited freedom of action and limited responsibilities; each contained in a larger individuality, to which its own interests aresubservient, and each containing lesser individualities in itself.-------STANZA I. -- Continued.4. THE SEVEN WAYS TO BLISS (Moksha* or Nirvana) WERE NOT (a).

Each is the effect of its antecedent cause, and a cause, in its turn, to its successor; the sumtotal of the Nidanas being based on the four truths, a doctrine especially characteristic of the Hinayana System.* They belong to thetheory of the stream of catenated law which produces merit and demerit, and finally brings Karma into full sway. It is based upon the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"great truth that re-incarnation is to be dreaded, as existence in this world only entails upon man suffering, misery and pain; Deathitself being unable to deliver man from it, since death is merely the door through which he passes to another life on earth after a littlerest on its threshold -- Devachan. The Hinayana System, or School of the \"Little Vehicle,\" is of very ancient growth; while theMahayana is of a later period, having originated after the death of Buddha. Yet the tenets of the latter are as old as the hills thathave contained such schools from time immemorial, and the Hinayana and Mahayana Schools (the latter, that of the \"Great Vehicle\")both teach the same doctrine in reality. Yana, or Vehicle (in Sanskrit, Vahan) is a mystic expression, both \"vehicles\" inculcating thatman may escape the sufferings of rebirths and even the false bliss of Devachan, by obtaining Wisdom and Knowledge, which alonecan dispel the Fruits of Illusion and Ignorance.Maya or illusion is an element which enters into all finite things, for everything that exists has only a relative, not an absolute, reality,since the appearance which the hidden noumenon assumes for any observer depends upon his power of cognition. To the untrainedeye of the savage, a painting is at first an unmeaning confusion of streaks and daubs of color, while an educated eye sees instantly aface or a landscape. Nothing is permanent except the one hidden absolute existence which contains in itself the noumena of allrealities. The existences belonging to every plane of being, up to the highest Dhyan-Chohans, are, in degree, of the nature ofshadows cast by a magic lantern on a colourless screen; but all things are relatively real, for the cogniser is also a reflection, and thethings cognised are therefore as real to him as himself. Whatever reality things possess must be looked for in them[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Wassilief on Buddhism, pp. 97-950.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 40 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.before or after they have passed like a flash through the material world; but we cannot cognise any such existence directly, so long aswe have sense-instruments which bring only material existence into the field of our consciousness. Whatever plane our consciousnessmay be acting in, both we and the things belonging to that plane are, for the time being, our only realities. As we rise in the scale ofdevelopment we perceive that during the stages through which we have passed we mistook shadows for realities, and the upwardprogress of the Ego is a series of progressive awakenings, each advance bringing with it the idea that now, at last, we have reached\"reality;\" but only when we shall have reached the absolute Consciousness, and blended our own with it, shall we be free from thedelusions produced by Maya.-------STANZA I. -- Continued.5. DARKNESS ALONE FILLED THE BOUNDLESS ALL (a), FOR FATHER, MOTHER AND SON WERE ONCE MORE ONE, AND THESON HAD NOT AWAKENED YET FOR THE NEW WHEEL* AND HIS PILGRIMAGE THEREON (b).(a) \"Darkness is Father-Mother: light their son,\" says an old Eastern proverb. Light is inconceivable except as coming from some sourcewhich is the cause of it; and as, in the instance of primordial light, that source is unknown, though as strongly demanded by reasonand logic, therefore it is called \"Darkness\" by us, from an intellectual point of view. As to borrowed or secondary light, whatever itssource, it can be but of a temporary mayavic character. Darkness, then, is the eternal[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* That which is called \"wheel\" is the symbolical expression for a world or globe, which shows that the ancients were aware that ourEarth was a revolving globe, not a motionless square as some Christian Fathers taught. The \"Great Wheel\" is the whole duration ofour Cycle of being, or Maha Kalpa, i.e., the whole revolution of our special chain of seven planets or Spheres from beginning to end;the \"Small Wheels\" meaning the Rounds, of which there are also Seven.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 41 WHAT IS DARKNESS IN PHILOSOPHY?matrix in which the sources of light appear and disappear. Nothing is added to darkness to make of it light, or to light to make itdarkness, on this our plane. They are interchangeable, and scientifically light is but a mode of darkness and vice versa. Yet both arephenomena of the same noumenon -- which is absolute darkness to the scientific mind, and but a gray twilight to the perception ofthe average mystic, though to that of the spiritual eye of the Initiate it is absolute light. How far we discern the light that shines indarkness depends upon our powers of vision. What is light to us is darkness to certain insects, and the eye of the clairvoyant seesillumination where the normal eye perceives only blackness. When the whole universe was plunged in sleep -- had returned to its oneprimordial element -- there was neither centre of luminosity, nor eye to perceive light, and darkness necessarily filled the boundlessall.(b) The Father-Mother are the male and female principles in root-nature, the opposite poles that manifest in all things on every planeof Kosmos, or Spirit and Substance, in a less allegorical aspect, the resultant of which is the Universe, or the Son. They are \"oncemore One\" when in \"The Night of Brahma,\" during Pralaya, all in the objective Universe has returned to its one primal and eternalcause, to reappear at the following Dawn -- as it does periodically. \"Karana\" -- eternal cause -- was alone.

In esoteric parlance, Brahma is Father-Mother-Son, or Spirit, Soul and Body at once; each personage being symbolical of an attribute, and each attribute or quality being agraduated efflux of Divine Breath in its cyclic differentiation, involutionary and evolutionary. In the cosmicophysical sense, it is theUniverse, the planetary chain and the earth; in the purely spiritual, the Unknown Deity, Planetary Spirit, and Man -- the Son of thetwo, the creature of Spirit and Matter, and a manifestation of them in his periodical appearances on Earth during the \"wheels,\" or theManvantaras. -- (See Part II. §: \"Days and Nights of Brahma.\")------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 42 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.STANZA I. -- Continued.6. THE SEVEN SUBLIME LORDS AND THE SEVEN TRUTHS HAD CEASED TO BE (a), AND THE UNIVERSE, THE SON OFNECESSITY, WAS IMMERSED IN PARANISHPANNA (b) (absolute perfection, Paranirvana, which is Yong-Grub) TO BE OUT-BREATHED BY THAT WHICH IS AND YET IS NOT. NAUGHT WAS (c).(a) The seven sublime lords are the Seven Creative Spirits, the Dhyan-Chohans, who correspond to the Hebrew Elohim. It is the samehierarchy of Archangels to which St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and others belong, in the Christian theogony. Only while St. Michael, forinstance, is allowed in dogmatic Latin theology to watch over all the promontories and gulfs, in the Esoteric System, the Dhyaniswatch successively over one of the Rounds and the great Root-races of our planetary chain. They are, moreover, said to send theirBhodisatvas, the human correspondents of the Dhyani-Buddhas (of whom vide infra) during every Round and Race. Out of the SevenTruths and Revelations, or rather revealed secrets, four only have been handed to us, as we are still in the Fourth Round, and theworld also has only had four Buddhas, so far. This is a very complicated question, and will receive more ample treatment later on.So far \"There are only Four Truths, and Four Vedas\" -- say the Hindus and Buddhists. For a similar reason Irenaeus insisted on thenecessity of Four Gospels. But as every new Root-race at the head of a Round must have its revelation and revealers, the next Roundwill bring the Fifth, the following the Sixth, and so on.(b) \"Paranishpanna\" is the absolute perfection to which all existences attain at the close of a great period of activity, or Maha-Manvantara, and in which they rest during the succeeding period of repose. In Tibetan it is called Yong-Grub. Up to the day of theYogacharya school the true nature of Paranirvana was taught publicly, but since then it has become entirely esoteric; hence so manycontradictory interpretations of it. It is only a true Idealist who can understand it. Everything has to be viewed as ideal, with theexception of Paranirvana, by him who would comprehend that state, and acquire a knowledge of how Non Ego, Voidness, andDarkness are Three in One and alone Self-existent and perfect. It is absolute, however, only in a relative------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 43 MOTIONS, THE \"GREAT BREATH.\"sense, for it must give room to still further absolute perfection, according to a higher standard of excellence in the following period ofactivity -- just as a perfect flower must cease to be a perfect flower and die, in order to grow into a perfect fruit, -- if a somewhat Irishmode of expression may be permitted.The Secret Doctrine teaches the progressive development of everything, worlds as well as atoms; and this stupendous developmenthas neither conceivable beginning nor imaginable end. Our \"Universe\" is only one of an infinite number of Universes, all of them\"Sons of Necessity,\" because links in the great Cosmic chain of Universes, each one standing in the relation of an effect as regards itspredecessor, and being a cause as regards its successor.The appearance and disappearance of the Universe are pictured as an outbreathing and inbreathing of \"the Great Breath,\" which iseternal, and which, being Motion, is one of the three aspects of the Absolute -- Abstract Space and Duration being the other two.When the \"Great Breath\" is projected, it is called the Divine Breath, and is regarded as the breathing of the Unknowable Deity -- theOne Existence -- which breathes out a thought, as it were, which becomes the Kosmos. (See \"Isis Unveiled.\") So also is it when theDivine Breath is inspired again the Universe disappears into the bosom of \"the Great Mother,\" who then sleeps \"wrapped in herinvisible robes.\"(c) By \"that which is and yet is not\" is meant the Great Breath itself, which we can only speak of as absolute existence, but cannotpicture to our imagination as any form of existence that we can distinguish from Non-existence. The three periods -- the Present, thePast, and the Future -- are in the esoteric philosophy a compound time; for the three are a composite number only in relation to thephenomenal plane, but in the realm of noumena have no abstract validity. As said in the Scriptures: \"The Past time is the Presenttime, as also the Future, which, though it has not come into existence, still is\"; according to a precept in the Prasanga Madhyamikateaching, whose dogmas have been known ever since it broke away from the purely esoteric schools.* Our ideas, in short, on durationand time are all derived from our[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Dzungarian \"Mani Kumbum,\" the \"Book of the 10,000 Precepts.\" Also consult Wassilief's \"Der Buddhismus,\" pp. 327 and 357,etc."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 44 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.sensations according to the laws of Association. Inextricably bound up with the relativity of human knowledge, they nevertheless canhave no existence except in the experience of the individual ego, and perish when its evolutionary march dispels the Maya ofphenomenal existence. What is Time, for instance, but the panoramic succession of our states of consciousness? In the words of aMaster, \"I feel irritated at having to use these three clumsy words -- Past, Present, and Future -- miserable concepts of the objectivephases of the subjective whole, they are about as ill-adapted for the purpose as an axe for fine carving.\" One has to acquireParamartha lest one should become too easy a prey to Samvriti -- is a philosophical axiom.*-------STANZA I. -- Continued.7. THE CAUSES OF EXISTENCE HAD BEEN DONE AWAY WITH (a); THE VISIBLE THAT WAS, AND THE INVISIBLE THAT IS,RESTED IN ETERNAL NON-BEING, THE ONE BEING (b).(a) \"The Causes of Existence\" mean not only the physical causes known to science, but the metaphysical causes, the chief of which isthe desire to exist, an outcome of Nidana and Maya. This desire for a sentient life shows itself in everything, from an atom to a sun,and is a reflection of the Divine Thought propelled into objective existence, into a law that the Universe should exist. According toesoteric teaching, the real cause of that supposed desire, and of all existence, remains for ever hidden, and its first emanations arethe most complete abstractions mind can conceive. These abstractions must of necessity be postulated as the cause of the materialUniverse which presents itself to the senses and intellect; and they underlie the secondary and subordinate powers of Nature, which,anthropomorphized, have been worshipped as God and gods by the common herd of every age. It is impossible to conceive anythingwithout a cause; the attempt to do so makes the mind a blank.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In clearer words: \"One has to acquire true Self-Consciousness in order to understand Samvriti, or the 'origin of delusion.'\" Paramarthais the synonym of the Sanskrit term Svasam-vedana, or \"the reflection which analyses itself.\" There is a difference in the interpretationof the meaning of \"Paramartha\" between the Yogacharyas and the Madhyamikas, neither of whom, however, explain the real andtrue esoteric sense of the expression. See further, sloka No. 9.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 45 BEING AND NON-BEING.This is virtually the condition to which the mind must come at last when we try to trace back the chain of causes and effects, but bothscience and religion jump to this condition of blankness much more quickly than is necessary; for they ignore the metaphysicalabstractions which are the only conceivable cause of physical concretions. These abstractions become more and more concrete asthey approach our plane of existence, until finally they phenomenalise in the form of the material Universe, by a process ofconversion of metaphysics into physics, analogous to that by which steam can be condensed into water, and the water frozen into ice.(b) The idea of Eternal Non-Being, which is the One Being, will appear a paradox to anyone who does not remember that we limitour ideas of being to our present consciousness of existence; making it a specific, instead of a generic term. An unborn infant, could itthink in our acceptation of that term, would necessarily limit its conception of being, in a similar manner, to the intrauterine life whichalone it knows; and were it to endeavour to express to its consciousness the idea of life after birth (death to it), it would, in the absenceof data to go upon, and of faculties to comprehend such data, probably express that life as \"Non-Being which is Real Being.\" In ourcase the One Being is the noumenon of all the noumena which we know must underlie phenomena, and give them whatever shadowof reality they possess, but which we have not the senses or the intellect to cognize at present. The impalpable atoms of goldscattered through the substance of a ton of auriferous quartz may be imperceptible to the naked eye of the miner, yet he knows thatthey are not only present there but that they alone give his quartz any appreciable value; and this relation of the gold to the quartzmay faintly shadow forth that of the noumenon to the phenomenon. But the miner knows what the gold will look like when extractedfrom the quartz, whereas the common mortal can form no conception of the reality of things separated from the Maya which veilsthem, and in which they are hidden. Alone the Initiate, rich with the lore acquired by numberless generations of his predecessors,directs the \"Eye of Dangma\" toward the essence of things in which no Maya can have any influence. It is here that the teachings ofesoteric philosophy in relation to the Nidanas and the Four Truths become of the greatest importance; but they are secret.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 46 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.STANZA I. -- Continued.8.

The SecretDoctrine carries this idea into the region of metaphysics and postulates a \"One Form of Existence\" as the basis and source of allthings. But perhaps the phrase, the \"One Form of Existence,\" is not altogether correct. The Sanskrit word is Prabhavapyaya, \"theplace, or rather plane, whence emerges the origination, and into which is the resolution of all things,\" says a commentator. It is notthe \"Mother of the World,\" as translated by Wilson (see Book I., Vishnu Purana); for Jagad Yoni (as shown by FitzEdward Hall) isscarcely so much \"the Mother of the World\" or \"the Womb of the World\" as the \"Material Cause of the Universe.\" The PuranicCommentators explain it by Karana -- \"Cause\" -- but the Esoteric philosophy, by the ideal spirit of that cause. It is, in its secondarystage, the Svabhavat of the Buddhist philosopher, the eternal cause and effect, omnipresent yet abstract, the self-existent plasticEssence and the root of all things, viewed in the same dual light as the Vedantin views his Parabrahm and Mulaprakriti, the oneunder two aspects. It seems indeed extraordinary to find great scholars speculating on the possibility of the Vedanta, and the Uttara-Mimansa especially, having been \"evoked by the teachings of the Buddhists,\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In India it is called \"The Eye of Siva,\" but beyond the great range it is known as \"Dangma's opened eye\" in esoteric phraseology.** Dangma means a purified soul, one who has become a Jivanmukta, the highest adept, or rather a Mahatma so-called. His \"openedeye\" is the inner spiritual eye of the seer, and the faculty which manifests through it is not clairvoyance as ordinarily understood, i.e.,the power of seeing at a distance, but rather the faculty of spiritual intuition, through which direct and certain knowledge isobtainable. This faculty is intimately connected with the \"third eye,\" which mythological tradition ascribes to certain races of men.Fuller explanations will be found in Book II.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 47 THE EYE OF DANGMA.whereas, it is on the contrary Buddhism (of Gautama, the Buddha) that was \"evoked\" and entirely upreared on the tenets of the SecretDoctrine, of which a partial sketch is here attempted, and on which, also, the Upanishads are made to rest.* The above, according tothe teachings of Sri Sankaracharya,** is undeniable.(b) Dreamless sleep is one of the seven states of consciousness known in Oriental esotericism. In each of these states a differentportion of the mind comes into action; or as a Vedantin would express it, the individual is conscious in a different plane of his being.The term \"dreamless sleep,\" in this case is applied allegorically to the Universe to express a condition somewhat analogous to thatstate of consciousness in man, which, not being remembered in a waking state, seems a blank, just as the sleep of the mesmerisedsubject seems to him an unconscious blank when he returns to his normal condition, although he has been talking and acting as aconscious individual would.-------STANZA I. -- Continued.9. BUT WHERE WAS THE DANGMA WHEN THE ALAYA OF THE UNIVERSE (Soul as the basis of all, Anima Mundi) WAS INPARAMARTHA (a) (Absolute Being and Consciousness which are Absolute Non-Being and Unconsciousness) AND THE GREATWHEEL WAS ANUPADAKA (b)?[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* And yet, one, claiming authority, namely, Sir Monier Williams, Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, has just denied this fact. Thisis what he taught his audience, on June the 4th, 1888, in his annual address before the Victoria Institute of Great Britain: \"Originally,Buddhism set its face against all solitary asceticism . . . to attain sublime heights of knowledge. It had no occult, no esoteric system ofdoctrine . . . withheld from ordinary men\" (!!) And, again: \" . . . When Gautama Buddha began his career, the later and lower form ofYoga seems to have been little known.\" And then, contradicting himself, the learned lecturer forthwith informs his audience that \"Welearn from Lalita-Vistara that various forms of bodily torture, self-maceration, and austerity were common in Gautama's time.\" (!!) Butthe lecturer seems quite unaware that this kind of torture and self-maceration is precisely the lower form of Yoga, Hatha Yoga, whichwas \"little known\" and yet so \"common\" in Gautama's time.** It is even argued that all the Six Darsanas (Schools of philosophy) show traces of Buddha's influence, being either taken fromBuddhism or due to Greek teaching! (See Weber, Max Muller, etc.) We labour under the impression that Colebrooke, \"the highestauthority\" in such matters, had long ago settled the question by showing, that \"the Hindus were in this instance the teachers, not thelearners.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 48 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(a) Here we have before us the subject of centuries of scholastic disputations. The two terms \"Alaya\" and \"Paramartha\" have been thecauses of dividing schools and splitting the truth into more different aspects than any other mystic terms. Alaya is literally the \"Soul ofthe World\" or Anima Mundi, the \"Over-Soul\" of Emerson, and according to esoteric teaching it changes periodically its nature. Alaya,though eternal and changeless in its inner essence on the planes which are unreachable by either men or Cosmic Gods (DhyaniBuddhas), alters during the active life-period with respect to the lower planes, ours included. During that time not only the Dhyani-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Buddhas are one with Alaya in Soul and Essence, but even the man strong in the Yoga (mystic meditation) \"is able to merge his soulwith it\" (Aryasanga, the Bumapa school). This is not Nirvana, but a condition next to it. Hence the disagreement. Thus, while theYogacharyas (of the Mahayana school) say that Alaya is the personification of the Voidness, and yet Alaya (Nyingpo and Tsang inTibetan) is the basis of every visible and invisible thing, and that, though it is eternal and immutable in its essence, it reflects itself inevery object of the Universe \"like the moon in clear tranquil water\"; other schools dispute the statement. The same for Paramartha:the Yogacharyas interpret the term as that which is also dependent upon other things (paratantra); and the Madhyamikas say thatParamartha is limited to Paranishpanna or absolute perfection; i.e., in the exposition of these \"two truths\" (out of four), the formerbelieve and maintain that (on this plane, at any rate) there exists only Samvritisatya or relative truth; and the latter teach theexistence of Paramarthasatya, the \"absolute truth.\"* \"No Arhat, oh mendicants, can reach absolute knowledge before he becomes onewith Paranirvana. Parikalpita and Paratantra are his two great enemies\" (Aphorisms of the Bodhisattvas). Parikalpita (in Tibetan Kun-ttag) is error, made by those unable to realize the emptiness and illusionary nature of all; who believe something to exist which doesnot -- e.g., the Non-Ego. And[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Paramartha\" is self-consciousness in Sanskrit, Svasamvedana, or the \"self-analysing reflection\" -- from two words, parama (aboveeverything) and artha (comprehension), Satya meaning absolute true being, or Esse. In Tibetan Paramarthasatya isDondampaidenpa. The opposite of this absolute reality, or actuality, is Samvritisatya -- the relative truth only -- \"Samvriti\" meaning\"false conception\" and being the origin of illusion, Maya; in Tibetan Kundzabchi-denpa, \"illusion-creating appearance.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 49 ALAYA, THE UNIVERSAL SOUL.Paratantra is that, whatever it is, which exists only through a dependent or causal connexion, and which has to disappear as soon asthe cause from which it proceeds is removed -- e.g., the light of a wick. Destroy or extinguish it, and light disappears.Esoteric philosophy teaches that everything lives and is conscious, but not that all life and consciousness are similar to those ofhuman or even animal beings. Life we look upon as \"the one form of existence,\" manifesting in what is called matter; or, as in man,what, incorrectly separating them, we name Spirit, Soul and Matter. Matter is the vehicle for the manifestation of soul on this plane ofexistence, and soul is the vehicle on a higher plane for the manifestation of spirit, and these three are a trinity synthesized by Life,which pervades them all. The idea of universal life is one of those ancient conceptions which are returning to the human mind in thiscentury, as a consequence of its liberation from anthropomorphic theology. Science, it is true, contents itself with tracing orpostulating the signs of universal life, and has not yet been bold enough even to whisper \"Anima Mundi!\" The idea of \"crystallinelife,\" now familiar to science, would have been scouted half a century ago. Botanists are now searching for the nerves of plants; notthat they suppose that plants can feel or think as animals do, but because they believe that some structure, bearing the same relationfunctionally to plant life that nerves bear to animal life, is necessary to explain vegetable growth and nutrition. It hardly seemspossible that science can disguise from itself much longer, by the mere use of terms such as \"force\" and \"energy,\" the fact that thingsthat have life are living things, whether they be atoms or planets.But what is the belief of the inner esoteric Schools? the reader may ask. What are the doctrines taught on this subject by the Esoteric\"Buddhists\"? With them \"Alaya\" has a double and even a triple meaning. In the Yogacharya system of the contemplative Mahayanaschool, Alaya is both the Universal Soul (Anima Mundi) and the Self of a progressed adept. \"He who is strong in the Yoga canintroduce at will his Alaya by means of meditation into the true Nature of Existence.\" The \"Alaya has an absolute eternal existence,\"says Aryasanga -- the rival of Nagarjuna.* In one sense it is Pradhana; which[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Aryasanga was a pre-Christian Adept and founder of a Buddhist esoteric school, though Csoma di Koros places him, for somereasons of his own, in the seventh century [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 50 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.is explained in Vishnu Purana as: \"that which is the unevolved cause, is emphatically called by the most eminent sages Pradhana,original base, which is subtile Prakriti, viz., that which is eternal, and which at once is (or comprehends) what is and what is not, or ismere process.\" \"Prakriti,\" however, is an incorrect word, and Alaya would explain it better; for Prakriti is not the \"uncognizableBrahma.\"* It is a mistake of those who know nothing of the Universality of the Occult doctrines from the very cradle of the humanraces, and especially so of those scholars who reject the very idea of a \"primordial revelation,\" to teach that the Anima Mundi, theOne Life or \"Universal Soul,\" was made known only by Anaxagoras, or during his age. This philosopher brought the teaching forwardsimply to oppose the too materialistic conceptions on Cosmogony of Democritus, based on his exoteric theory of blindly driven atoms.Anaxagoras of Clazomene was not its inventor but only its propagator, as also was Plato. That which he called Mundane Intelligence,the nous ([[nous]]), the principle that according to his views is absolutely separated and free from matter and acts on design,** wascalled Motion, the ONE LIFE, or Jivatma, ages before the year 500 B.C. in India. Only the Aryan philosophers never endowed theprinciple, which with them is infinite, with the finite \"attribute\" of \"thinking.\"This leads the reader naturally to the \"Supreme Spirit\" of Hegel and the German Transcendentalists as a contrast that it may beuseful to point out. The schools of Schelling and Fichte have diverged widely from the primitive archaic conception of an ABSOLUTEprinciple, and have mirrored only an aspect of the basic idea of the Vedanta. Even the \"Absoluter Geist\" shadowed forth by von"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Hartman in his pessimistic philosophy of the Unconscious, while it is, perhaps, the closest approximation made by Europeanspeculation to the Hindu Adwaitee Doctrines, similarly falls far short of the reality.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] A.D. There was another Aryasanga, who lived during the first centuries of our era and theHungarian scholar most probably confuses the two.* \"The indiscreet cause which is uniform, and both cause and effect, and which those who are acquainted with first principles callPradhana and Prakriti, is the incognizable Brahma who was before all\" (Vayu Purana); i.e., Brahma does not put forth evolution itselfor create, but only exhibits various aspects of itself, one of which is Prakriti, an aspect of Pradhana.** Finite Self-consciousness, I mean. For how can the absolute attain it otherwise than as simply an aspect, the highest of which knownto us is human consciousness?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 51 CAN THE FINITE CONCEIVE THE INFINITE?According to Hegel, the \"Unconscious\" would never have undertaken the vast and laborious task of evolving the Universe, except inthe hope of attaining clear Self-consciousness. In this connection it is to be borne in mind that in designating Spirit, which theEuropean Pantheists use as equivalent to Parabrahm, as unconscious, they do not attach to that expression of \"Spirit\" -- oneemployed in the absence of a better to symbolise a profound mystery -- the connotation it usually bears.The \"Absolute Consciousness,\" they tell us, \"behind\" phenomena, which is only termed unconsciousness in the absence of anyelement of personality, transcends human conception. Man, unable to form one concept except in terms of empirical phenomena, ispowerless from the very constitution of his being to raise the veil that shrouds the majesty of the Absolute. Only the liberated Spirit isable to faintly realise the nature of the source whence it sprung and whither it must eventually return. . . . As the highest DhyanChohan, however, can but bow in ignorance before the awful mystery of Absolute Being; and since, even in that culmination ofconscious existence -- \"the merging of the individual in the universal consciousness\" -- to use a phrase of Fichte's -- the Finite cannotconceive the Infinite, nor can it apply to it its own standard of mental experiences, how can it be said that the \"Unconscious\" and theAbsolute can have even an instinctive impulse or hope of attaining clear self-consciousness?* A Vedantin would never admit thisHegelian idea; and the Occultist would say that it applies perfectly to the awakened MAHAT, the Universal Mind already projectedinto the phenomenal world as the first aspect of the changeless ABSOLUTE, but never to the latter. \"Spirit and Matter, or Purusha andPrakriti are but the two primeval aspects of the One and Secondless,\" we are taught.The matter-moving Nous, the animating Soul, immanent in every atom, manifested in man, latent in the stone, has different degreesof power; and this pantheistic idea of a general Spirit-Soul pervading all Nature is the oldest of all the philosophical notions.

The whole series of the numberless speculations of this kind are butvariations on this theme, the key-note of which was struck in this primeval Revelation. (See Part II., \"Primordial Substance.\")(b) The term Anupadaka, \"parentless,\" or without progenitors, is a mystical designation having several meanings in the philosophy. Bythis name celestial beings, the Dhyan-Chohans or Dhyani-Buddhas, are generally meant. But as these correspond mystically to thehuman Buddhas and Bodhisattwas, known as the \"Manushi (or human) Buddhas,\" the latter are also designated \"Anupadaka,\" oncethat their whole personality is merged in their compound sixth and seventh principles -- or Atma-Buddhi, and that they have becomethe \"diamond-souled\" (Vajra-sattvas),* the full Mahatmas. The \"Concealed Lord\" (Sangbai Dag-po), \"the one merged with theabsolute,\" can have no parents since he is Self-existent, and one with the Universal Spirit (Svayambhu),** the Svabhavat in thehighest aspect. The mystery in the hierarchy of the Anupadaka is great, its apex being the universal Spirit-Soul, and the lower rungthe Manushi-Buddha; and even every Soul-endowed man is an Anupadaka in a latent state. Hence, when speaking of the Universe inits formless, eternal, or absolute condition, before it was fashioned by the \"Builders\" -- the expression, \"the Universe was Anupadaka.\"(See Part II., \"Primordial Substance.\")[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vajra -- diamond-holder.

THERE WAS NEITHER SILENCE, NOR SOUND (a).NAUGHT SAVE CEASELESS, ETERNAL BREATH (Motion) WHICH KNOWS ITSELF NOT (b).(a) The idea that things can cease to exist and still BE, is a fundamental one in Eastern psychology. Under this apparent contradictionin terms, there rests a fact of Nature to realise which in the mind, rather than to argue about words, is the important thing. A familiarinstance of a similar paradox is afforded by chemical combination. The question whether Hydrogen and Oxygen cease to exist, whenthey combine to form water, is still a moot one, some arguing that since they are found again when the water is decomposed theymust be there all the while; others contending that as they actually turn into something totally different they must cease to exist asthemselves for the time being; but neither side is able to form the faintest conception of the real condition of a thing, which hasbecome something else and yet has not ceased to be itself. Existence as water may be said to be, for Oxygen and Hydrogen, a stateof Non-being which is \"more real being\" than their existence as gases; and it may faintly symbolise the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Hence Non-being is \"ABSOLUTE Being,\" in esoteric philosophy.

The One Eternal Element, or element-containing Vehicle, isSpace, dimensionless in every sense; co-existent with which are -- endless duration, primordial (hence indestructible) matter, andmotion -- absolute \"perpetual motion\" which is the \"breath\" of the \"One\" Element. This breath, as seen, can never cease, not evenduring the Pralayic eternities. (See \"Chaos, Theos, Kosmos,\" in Part II.)But the \"Breath of the One Existence\" does not, all the same, apply to the One Causeless Cause or the \"All Be-ness\" (incontradistinction to All-Being, which is Brahma, or the Universe). Brahma (or Hari) the four-faced god who, after lifting the Earth out ofthe waters, \"accomplished the Creation,\" is held to be only the instrumental, and not, as clearly implied, the ideal Cause. NoOrientalist, so far, seems to have thoroughly comprehended the real sense of the verses in the Purana, that treat of \"creation.\"Therein Brahma is the cause of the potencies that are to be generated subsequently for the work of \"creation.\" When a translator says,\"And from him proceed the potencies to be created, after they had become the real cause\": \"and from IT proceed the potencies thatwill create as they become the real cause\" (on the material plane) would perhaps be more correct? Save that one (causeless) idealcause there is no other to which the universe can be referred. \"Worthiest of ascetics! through its potency -- i.e., through the potency ofthat cause -- every created thing comes by its inherent or proper nature.\" If, in the Vedanta and Nyaya, nimitta is the efficient cause,as contrasted with upadana, the material cause, (and in the Sankhya, pradhana implies the functions of both); in the Esotericphilosophy, which reconciles all these systems, and the nearest exponent of which is the Vedanta as expounded by the AdvaitaVedantists, none but the upadana can be speculated upon; that which is in the minds of the Vaishnavas (the Vasishta-dvaita) as theideal in contradistinction to the real -- or Parabrahm and Isvara -- can find no room in published speculations, since------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 56 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.that ideal even is a misnomer, when applied to that of which no human reason, even that of an adept, can conceive.To know itself or oneself, necessitates consciousness and perception (both limited faculties in relation to any subject exceptParabrahm), to be cognized. Hence the \"Eternal Breath which knows itself not.\" Infinity cannot comprehend Finiteness. TheBoundless can have no relation to the bounded and the conditioned. In the occult teachings, the Unknown and the UnknowableMOVER, or the Self-Existing, is the absolute divine Essence. And thus being Absolute Consciousness, and Absolute Motion -- to thelimited senses of those who describe this indescribable -- it is unconsciousness and immoveableness. Concrete consciousness cannotbe predicated of abstract Consciousness, any more than the quality wet can be predicated of water -- wetness being its own attributeand the cause of the wet quality in other things. Consciousness implies limitations and qualifications; something to be conscious of,and someone to be conscious of it. But Absolute Consciousness contains the cognizer, the thing cognized and the cognition, all threein itself and all three one. No man is conscious of more than that portion of his knowledge that happens to have been recalled to hismind at any particular time, yet such is the poverty of language that we have no term to distinguish the knowledge not activelythought of, from knowledge we are unable to recall to memory. To forget is synonymous with not to remember. How much greatermust be the difficulty of finding terms to describe, and to distinguish between, abstract metaphysical facts or differences. It must not beforgotten, also, that we give names to things according to the appearances they assume for ourselves. We call absolute consciousness\"unconsciousness,\" because it seems to us that it must necessarily be so, just as we call the Absolute, \"Darkness,\" because to our finiteunderstanding it appears quite impenetrable, yet we recognize fully that our perception of such things does not do them justice. Weinvoluntarily distinguish in our minds, for instance, between unconscious absolute consciousness, and unconsciousness, by secretlyendowing the former with some indefinite quality that corresponds, on a higher plane than our thoughts can reach, with what we knowas consciousness in ourselves. But this is not any kind of consciousness that we can manage to distinguish from what appears to us asunconsciousness.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 57 THE GERM OF LIFE.STANZA II. -- Continued.3.

The popular reasons given are, firstly, the fact just mentioned, that the Lotus-seedcontains within itself a perfect miniature of the future plant, which typifies the fact that the spiritual prototypes of all things exist in theimmaterial world before those things become materialised on Earth. Secondly, the fact that the Lotus plant grows up through thewater, having its root in the Ilus, or mud, and spreading its flower in the air above. The Lotus thus typifies the life of man and also thatof the Kosmos; for the Secret Doctrine teaches that the elements of both are the same, and that both are developing in the samedirection. The root of the Lotus sunk in the mud represents material life, the stalk passing up through the water typifies existence in theastral world, and the flower floating on the water and opening to the sky is emblematical of spiritual being.-------STANZA II. -- Continued.4. HER HEART HAD NOT YET OPENED FOR THE ONE RAY TO ENTER, THENCE TO FALL AS THREE INTO FOUR IN THE LAPOF MAYA (a).(a) The Primordial Substance had not yet passed out of its precosmic latency into differentiated objectivity, or even become the (toman, so far,) invisible Protyle of Science. But, as the hour strikes and it becomes receptive of the Fohatic impress of the DivineThought (the Logos, or the male aspect of the Anima Mundi, Alaya) -- its heart opens. It differentiates, and the THREE (Father,Mother, Son) are transformed into four. Herein lies the origin of the double mystery of the Trinity and the immaculate Conception.The first and Fundamental dogma of Occultism is Universal Unity (or Homogeneity) under three aspects. This led to a possibleconception of Deity, which as an absolute unity must remain forever incomprehensible to finite intellects. \"If thou wouldest believe inthe Power which acts within the root of a plant, or imagine the root concealed under the soil, thou hast to think of its stalk or trunk andof its leaves and flowers. Thou canst not imagine that Power independently of these objects. Life can be known only by the Tree ofLife. . . .\" (Precepts for Yoga). The idea of Absolute Unity------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 59 ASTRAL LIGHT IS NOT THE ANIMA MUNDI.would be broken entirely in our conception, had we not something concrete before our eyes to contain that Unity. And the deity beingabsolute, must be omnipresent, hence not an atom but contains IT within itself. The roots, the trunk and its many branches are threedistinct objects, yet they are one tree. Say the Kabalists: \"The Deity is one, because It is infinite. It is triple, because it is evermanifesting.\" This manifestation is triple in its aspects, for it requires, as Aristotle has it, three principles for every natural body tobecome objective: privation, form, and matter.* Privation meant in the mind of the great philosopher that which the Occultists call theprototypes impressed in the Astral Light -- the lowest plane and world of Anima Mundi. The union of these three principles dependsupon a fourth -- the LIFE which radiates from the summits of the Unreachable, to become an universally diffused Essence on themanifested planes of Existence. And this QUATERNARY (Father, Mother, Son, as a UNITY, and a quaternary, as a livingmanifestation) has been the means of leading to the very archaic Idea of Immaculate Conception, now finally crystallized into adogma of the Christian Church, which carnalized this metaphysical idea beyond any common sense. For one has but to read theKabala and study its numerical methods of interpretation to find the origin of that dogma. It is purely astronomical, mathematical,and pre-eminently metaphysical: the Male element in Nature (personified by the male deities and Logoi -- Viraj, or Brahma; Horus, orOsiris, etc., etc.) is born through, not from, an immaculate source, personified by the \"Mother\"; because that Male having a Mothercannot have a \"Father\" -- the abstract Deity being sexless, and not even a Being but Be-ness, or Life itself. Let us render this in themathematical language of the author of \"The Source of Measures.\" Speaking of the \"Measure of a Man\" and his numerical(Kabalistic) value, he writes that in Genesis, ch. iv., v. 1, \"It is called the 'Man even Jehovah'"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* A Vedantin of the Visishtadwaita philosophy would say that, though the only independent Reality, Parabrahmam is inseparablefrom his trinity.

Here the Man-number 113 becomes a factor of 56.5 x 10, and the (Kabalistic) reading of this last numbered expression isJod, He, Vau, He, or Jehovah. . . . The expansion of 565 into 56.5 x 10 is purposed to show the emanation of the male (Jod) from thefemale (Eva) principle; or, so to speak, the birth of a male element from an immaculate source, in other words, an immaculateconception.\"Thus is repeated on Earth the mystery enacted, according to the Seers, on the divine plane. The \"Son\" of the immaculate CelestialVirgin (or the undifferentiated cosmic protyle, Matter in its infinitude) is born again on Earth as the Son of the terrestrial Eve -- ourmother Earth, and becomes Humanity as a total -- past, present, and future -- for Jehovah or Jod-he-vau-he is androgyne, or both maleand female. Above, the Son is the whole KOSMOS; below, he is MANKIND. The triad or triangle becomes Tetraktis, the SacredPythagorean number, the perfect Square, and a 6-faced cube on Earth. The Macroprosopus (the Great Face) is now Microprosopus(the lesser face); or, as the Kabalists have it, the \"Ancient of Days,\" descending on Adam Kadmon whom he uses as his vehicle tomanifest through, gets transformed into Tetragrammaton.

The \"Seven Sons,\" therefore, are the creators of the latter. This teaching will be explained more fully hereafter.(See Part II., \"Theogony of the Creative Gods.\")------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 61 DIVINE THOUGHT, DIVINE THINKERS.Svabhavat, the \"Plastic Essence\" that fills the Universe, is the root of all things. Svabhavat is, so to say, the Buddhistic concrete aspectof the abstraction called in Hindu philosophy Mulaprakriti. It is the body of the Soul, and that which Ether would be to Akasa, thelatter being the informing principle of the former. Chinese mystics have made of it the synonym of \"being.\" In the Ekasloka-Shastra ofNagarjuna (the Lung-shu of China) called by the Chinese the Yih-shu-lu-kia-lun, it is said that the original word of Yeu is \"Being\" or\"Subhava,\" \"the Substance giving substance to itself,\" also explained by him as meaning \" without action and with action,\" \"thenature which has no nature of its own.\" Subhava, from which Svabhavat, is composed of two words: Su \"fair,\" \"handsome,\" \"good\";Sva, \"self\"; and bhava, \"being\" or \"states of being.\"-------STANZA II. -- Continued.6. THESE TWO ARE THE GERM, AND THE GERM IS -- ONE. THE UNIVERSE WAS STILL CONCEALED IN THE DIVINE THOUGHTAND THE DIVINE BOSOM.The \"Divine Thought\" does not imply the idea of a Divine thinker. The Universe, not only past, present, and future -- which is a humanand finite idea expressed by finite thought -- but in its totality, the Sat (an untranslateable term), the absolute being, with the Past andFuture crystallized in an eternal Present, is that Thought itself reflected in a secondary or manifest cause. Brahma (neuter) as theMysterium Magnum of Paracelsus is an absolute mystery to the human mind. Brahma, the male-female, its aspect andanthropomorphic reflection, is conceivable to the perceptions of blind faith, though rejected by human intellect when it attains itsmajority. (See Part II., \"Primordial Substance and Divine Thought.\")Hence the statement that during the prologue, so to say, of the drama of Creation, or the beginning of cosmic evolution, the Universeor the \"Son\" lies still concealed \"in the Divine Thought,\" which had not yet penetrated \"into the Divine Bosom.\" This idea, note well,is at the root, and forms the origin of all the allegories about the \"Sons of God\" born of immaculate virgins."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 62 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.STANZA III.COMMENTARY.1. THE LAST VIBRATION OF THE SEVENTH ETERNITY THRILLS THROUGH INFINITUDE (a). THE MOTHER SWELLS,EXPANDING FROM WITHIN WITHOUT LIKE THE BUD OF THE LOTUS (b).(a) The seemingly paradoxical use of the sentence \"Seventh Eternity,\" thus dividing the indivisible, is sanctified in esotericphilosophy. The latter divides boundless duration into unconditionally eternal and universal Time and a conditioned one(Khandakala). One is the abstraction or noumenon of infinite time (Kala); the other its phenomenon appearing periodically, as theeffect of Mahat (the Universal Intelligence limited by Manvantaric duration). With some schools, Mahat is \"the first-born\" of Pradhana(undifferentiated substance, or the periodical aspect of Mulaprakriti, the root of Nature), which (Pradhana) is called Maya, the Illusion.In this respect, I believe, esoteric teaching differs from the Vedantin doctrines of both the Adwaita and the Visishtadwaita schools. Forit says that, while Mulaprakriti, the noumenon, is self-existing and without any origin -- is, in short, parentless, Anupadaka (as one withBrahmam) -- Prakriti, its phenomenon, is periodical and no better than a phantasm of the former, so Mahat, with the Occultists, thefirst-born of Gnana (or gnosis) knowledge, wisdom or the Logos -- is a phantasm reflected from the Absolute NIRGUNA (Parabrahm, theone reality, \"devoid of attributes and qualities\"; see Upanishads); while with some Vedantins Mahat is a manifestation of Prakriti, orMatter.(b) Therefore, the \"last vibration of the Seventh Eternity\" was \"fore-ordained\" -- by no God in particular, but occurred in virtue of theeternal and changeless LAW which causes the great periods of Activity and Rest, called so graphically, and at the same time sopoetically, the \"Days and Nights of Brahma.\" The expansion \"from within without\" of the Mother, called elsewhere the \"Waters ofSpace,\" \"Universal Matrix,\" etc., does not allude to an expansion from a small centre or focus, but, without reference to size orlimitation or area, means the development of limitless subjectivity into as limitless objectivity. \"The ever (to us) invisible andimmaterial Substance present in eternity, threw its periodical shadow from its own plane into the lap------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 63 THE UNIVERSE, A FLITTING SHADOW.of Maya.\" It implies that this expansion, not being an increase in size -- for infinite extension admits of no enlargement -- was achange of condition. It \"expanded like the bud of the Lotus\"; for the Lotus plant exists not only as a miniature embryo in its seed (aphysical characteristic), but its prototype is present in an ideal form in the Astral Light from \"Dawn\" to \"Night\" during the Manvantaricperiod, like everything else, as a matter of fact, in this objective Universe; from man down to mite, from giant trees down to the tiniestblades of grass.All this, teaches the hidden Science, is but the temporary reflection, the shadow of the eternal ideal prototype in Divine Thought --the word \"Eternal,\" note well again, standing here only in the sense of \"AEon,\" as lasting throughout the seemingly interminable, butstill limited cycle of activity, called by us Manvantara. For what is the real esoteric meaning of Manvantara, or rather a Manu-Antara?It means, esoterically, \"between two Manus,\" of whom there are fourteen in every \"Day of Brahma,\" such a \"Day\" consisting of 1,000aggregates of four ages, or 1,000 \"Great Ages,\" Mahayugas. Let us now analyse the word or name Manu. Orientalists and theirDictionaries tell us that the term \"Manu\" is from the root Man, \"to think\"; hence \"the thinking man.\" But, esoterically, every Manu, asan anthropomorphized patron of his special cycle (or Round), is but the personified idea of the \"Thought Divine\" (as the Hermetic\"Pymander\"); each of the Manus, therefore, being the special god, the creator and fashioner of all that appears during his ownrespective cycle of being or Manvantara. Fohat runs the Manus' (or Dhyan-Chohans') errands, and causes the ideal prototypes toexpand from within without -- viz., to cross gradually, on a descending scale, all the planes from the noumenon to the lowestphenomenon, to bloom finally on the last into full objectivity -- the acme of illusion, or the grossest matter.-------STANZA III. -- continued.2.

Itsoriginal is the Brahminical Narayana (the mover on the Waters), who is the personification of the eternal Breath of the unconscious All(or Parabrahm) of the Eastern Occultists. The Waters of Life, or Chaos -- the female principle in symbolism -- are the vacuum (to ourmental sight) in which lie the latent Spirit and Matter. This it was that made Democritus assert, after his instructor Leucippus, that theprimordial principles of all were atoms and a vacuum, in the sense of space, but not of empty space, as \"Nature abhors a vacuum\"according to the Peripatetics, and every ancient philosopher."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"In all Cosmogonies \"Water\" plays the same important part.

THE RAY SHOOTS THROUGH THE VIRGIN-EGG; THE RAY CAUSES THE ETERNAL EGG TO THRILL, AND DROP THENON-ETERNAL (periodical) GERM, WHICH CONDENSES INTO THE WORLD EGG (a).(a) The solitary ray dropping into the mother deep may be taken as meaning Divine Thought or Intelligence, impregnating chaos.This, however, occurs on the plane of metaphysical abstraction, or rather the plane whereon that which we call a metaphysicalabstraction is a reality. The Virgin-egg being in one sense abstract Egg-ness, or the power of becoming developed throughfecundation, is eternal and for ever the same. And just as the fecundation of an egg takes place before it is dropped; so the non-eternal periodical germ which becomes later in------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 65 NATURE'S SYMBOLS.symbolism the mundane egg, contains in itself, when it emerges from the said symbol, \"the promise and potency\" of all the Universe.Though the idea per se is, of course, an abstraction, a symbolical mode of expression, it is a symbol truly, as it suggests the idea ofinfinity as an endless circle. It brings before the mind's eye the picture of Kosmos emerging from and in boundless space, a Universeas shoreless in magnitude if not as endless in its objective manifestation. The simile of an egg also expresses the fact taught inOccultism that the primordial form of everything manifested, from atom to globe, from man to angel, is spheroidal, the sphere havingbeen with all nations the emblem of eternity and infinity -- a serpent swallowing its tail. To realize the meaning, however, the spheremust be thought of as seen from its centre. The field of vision or of thought is like a sphere whose radii proceed from one's self inevery direction, and extend out into space, opening up boundless vistas all around. It is the symbolical circle of Pascal and theKabalists, \"whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere,\" a conception which enters into the compound idea of thisemblem.The \"Mundane Egg\" is, perhaps, one of the most universally adopted symbols, highly suggestive as it is, equally in the spiritual,physiological, and cosmological sense. Therefore, it is found in every world-theogony, where it is largely associated with the serpentsymbol; the latter being everywhere, in philosophy as in religious symbolism, an emblem of eternity, infinitude, regeneration, andrejuvenation, as well as of wisdom. (See Part II. \"Tree and Serpent and Crocodile Worship.\") The mystery of apparent self-generationand evolution through its own creative power repeating in miniature the process of Cosmic evolution in the egg, both being due toheat and moisture under the efflux of the unseen creative spirit, justified fully the selection of this graphic symbol. The \"Virgin Egg\" isthe microcosmic symbol of the macrocosmic prototype -- the \"Virgin Mother\" -- Chaos or the Primeval Deep. The male Creator (underwhatever name) springs forth from the Virgin female, the immaculate root fructified by the Ray. Who, if versed in astronomy andnatural sciences, can fail to see its suggestiveness? Cosmos as receptive Nature is an Egg fructified -- yet left immaculate; onceregarded as boundless, it could have no other representation than a spheroid. The Golden Egg was surrounded by seven naturalelements (ether, fire, air, water), \"four ready, three secret.\" It may be found------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 66 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.stated in Vishnu Purana, where elements are translated \"Envelopes\" and a secret one is added: \"Aham-kara\" (see Wilson's VishnuPurana, Book I., p. 40).

In the \"Book of Dzyan,\" as in the Kabala, there are two kinds of numerals to bestudied -- the figures, often simple blinds, and the Sacred Numbers, the values of which are all known to the Occultists throughInitiation.

From an astronomical point of view this is easy ofexplanation: it is the \"milky way,\" the world-stuff, or primordial matter in its first form. It is more difficult, however, to explain it in a fewwords or even lines, from the standpoint of Occult Science and Symbolism, as it is the most complicated of glyphs. Herein areenshrined more than a dozen symbols. To begin with, the whole pantheon of mysterious objects,** every one of them having somedefinite Occult meaning, extracted from the allegorical \"churning of the ocean\" by the Hindu gods. Besides Amrita, the water of life orimmortality, \"Surabhi\" the \"cow of plenty,\" called \"the fountain of milk and curds,\" was extracted from this \"Sea of Milk.\" Hence theuniversal adoration of the cow and bull, one the productive, the other the generative power in Nature: symbols connected with boththe Solar and the Cosmic deities. The specific properties, for occult purposes, of the \"fourteen precious things,\" being explained onlyat the fourth Initiation, cannot be given here; but the following may be remarked. In the \"Satapatha Brahmana\" it is stated that thechurning of the \"Ocean of Milk\" took place in the Satya Yug, the first age which immediately followed the \"Deluge.\" As, however,neither the Rig-Veda nor[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Number, truly; but never MOTION. It is Motion which begets the Logos, the Word, in occultism.** The \"Fourteen precious things.\" The narrative or allegory is found in the Satapatha Brahmana and others.

This \"churning\" relates to aperiod before the earth's formation, and is in direct connection with that other universal legend, the various and contradictory versionsof which culminated in the Christian dogma of the \"War in Heaven,\" and the fall of the Angels (see Book II., also Revelations chap.xii.). The Brahmanas, reproached by the Orientalists with their versions on the same subjects, often clashing with each other, are pre-eminently occult works, hence used purposely as blinds. They were allowed to survive for public use and property only because theywere and are absolutely unintelligible to the masses. Otherwise they would have disappeared from circulation as long ago as the daysof Akbar.-------STANZA III. -- Continued.5.

Fire and Water, or Father* and Mother, may be taken here to mean the divine Ray andChaos. \"Chaos, from this union with Spirit obtaining sense, shone with pleasure, and thus was produced the Protogonos (the first-bornlight),\" says a fragment of Hermas. Damascius calls it Dis in \"Theogony\" -- \"The disposer of all things.\" (See Cory's \"AncientFragments,\" p. 314.)According to the Rosicrucian tenets, as handled and explained by the profane for once correctly, if only partially, so \"Light andDarkness are identical in themselves, being only divisible in the human mind\"; and according to Robert Fludd, \"Darkness adoptedillumination in order to make itself visible\" (On Rosenkranz). According to the tenets of Eastern Occultism, DARKNESS is the one trueactuality, the basis and the root of light, without which the latter could never manifest itself, nor even exist. Light is matter, andDARKNESS pure Spirit. Darkness, in its radical, metaphysical basis, is subjective and absolute light; while the latter in all its seemingeffulgence and glory, is merely a mass of shadows, as it can never be eternal, and is simply an illusion, or Maya.Even in the mind-baffling and science-harassing Genesis, light is created out of darkness \"and darkness was upon the face of thedeep\" (ch. i. v. 2.) -- and not vice versa. \"In him (in darkness) was life; and the life was the light of men\" (John i. 4). A day may comewhen the eyes of men will be opened; and then they may comprehend better than they do now, that verse in the Gospel of John thatsays \"And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not.\" They will see then that the word \"darkness\" does notapply to man's spiritual eyesight, but indeed to \"Darkness,\" the absolute, that comprehendeth not (cannot cognize) transient light,however transcendent to human eyes.

Jehovah -- esoterically (as Elohim) -- is also the Serpent or Dragon that tempted Eve, and the \"Dragon\" isan old glyph for \"Astral Light\" (Primordial Principle), \"which is the Wisdom of Chaos.\" Archaic philosophy, recognizing neither Goodnor Evil as a fundamental or independent power, but starting from the Absolute ALL (Universal Perfection eternally), traced boththrough the course of natural evolution to pure Light condensing gradually into form, hence becoming Matter or Evil. It was left withthe early and ignorant Christian fathers to degrade the philosophical and highly scientific idea of this emblem (the Dragon) into theabsurd superstition called the \"Devil.\" They took it from the later Zoroastrians, who saw devils or the Evil in the Hindu Devas, and theword Evil thus became by a double transmutation D'Evil in every tongue (Diabolos, Diable, Diavolo, Teufel). But the Pagans havealways shown a philosophical discrimination in their symbols. The primitive symbol of the serpent symbolised divine Wisdom andPerfection, and had always stood for psychical Regeneration and Immortality. Hence -- Hermes, calling the serpent the most spiritualof all beings; Moses, initiated in the wisdom of Hermes, following suit in Genesis; the Gnostic's Serpent with the seven vowels over itshead, being the emblem of the seven hierarchies of the Septenary or Planetary Creators. Hence, also, the Hindu serpent Sesha orAnanta, \"the Infinite,\" a name of Vishnu, whose first Vahan or vehicle on the primordial waters is this serpent.* Yet they all made adifference between the good and the bad Serpent (the Astral Light of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Like the logoi and the Hierarchies of Powers, however, the \"Serpents\" have to be distinguished one from the other. Sesha or Ananta,\"the couch of Vishnu,\" is an allegorical abstraction, symbolizing infinite Time in Space, which contains the germ and throws offperiodically the efflorescence of this germ, the manifested Universe; whereas, the gnostic Ophis contained the same triple symbolismin its seven vowels as the One, Three and Seven-syllabled Oeaohoo of the Archaic doctrine; i.e., the One Unmanifested Logos, theSecond manifested, the triangle concreting into the Quaternary or Tetragrammaton, and the rays of the latter on the material plane.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 74 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Kabalists) -- between the former, the embodiment of divine Wisdom in the region of the Spiritual, and the latter, Evil, on theplane of matter.* Jesus accepted the serpent as a synonym of Wisdom, and this formed part of his teaching: \"Be ye wise as serpents,\"he says. \"In the beginning, before Mother became Father-Mother, the fiery Dragon moved in the infinitudes alone\" (Book ofSarparajni.) The Aitareya Brahmana calls the Earth Sarparajni, \"the Serpent Queen,\" and \"the Mother of all that moves.\" Before ourglobe became egg-shaped (and the Universe also) \"a long trail of Cosmic dust (or fire mist) moved and writhed like a serpent inSpace.\" The \"Spirit of God moving on Chaos\" was symbolized by every nation in the shape of a fiery serpent breathing fire and lightupon the primordial waters, until it had incubated cosmic matter and made it assume the annular shape of a serpent with its tail in itsmouth -- which symbolises not only Eternity and Infinitude, but also the globular shape of all the bodies formed within the Universefrom that fiery mist. The Universe, as well as the Earth and Man, cast off periodically, serpent-like, their old skins, to assume new onesafter a time of rest. The serpent is, surely, a not less graceful or a more unpoetical image than the caterpillar and chrysalis from whichsprings the butterfly, the Greek emblem of Psyche, the human soul. The \"Dragon\" was also the symbol of the Logos with theEgyptians, as with the Gnostics. In the \"Book of Hermes,\" Pymander, the oldest and the most spiritual of the Logoi of the WesternContinent, appears to Hermes in the shape of a Fiery Dragon of \"Light, Fire, and Flame.\" Pymander, the \"Thought Divine\"personified, says: The Light is me, I am the Nous (the mind or Manu), I am thy God, and I am far older than the human principlewhich escapes from the shadow (\"Darkness,\" or the concealed Deity). I am the germ of thought, the resplendent Word, the Son of God.All that thus sees and hears in thee is the Verbum of the Master, it is the Thought (Mahat) which is God, the Father.**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Astral Light, or the AEther, of the ancient pagans (for the name of Astral Light is quite modern) is Spirit-Matter.

Only the latter does not place at the headand Evolution of Life \"the Father,\" who comes third and is the \"Son of the Mother,\" but the \"Eternal and Ceaseless Breath of theALL.\" The Mahat (Understanding, Universal Mind, Thought, etc.), before it manifests itself as Brahma or Siva, appears as Vishnu, saysSankhya Sara (p. 16); hence Mahat has several aspects, just as the logos has. Mahat is called the Lord, in the Primary Creation, andis, in this sense, Universal Cognition or Thought Divine; but, \"That Mahat which was first produced is (afterwards) called Ego-ism,when it is born as \"I,\" that is said to be the second Creation\" (Anugita, ch. xxvi.). And the translator (an able and learned Brahmin, nota European Orientalist) explains in a foot-note (6), \"i.e., when Mahat develops into the feeling of Self-Consciousness -- I -- then itassumes the name of Egoism,\" which, translated into our esoteric phraseology, means when Mahat is transformed into the humanManas (or even that of the finite gods), and becomes Aham-ship. Why it is called the Mahat of the Second creation (or the ninth, thatof the Kumara in Vishnu Purana) will be explained in Book II. The \"Sea of Fire\" is then the Super-Astral (i.e., noumenal) Light, thefirst radiation from the Root, the Mulaprakriti, the undifferentiated Cosmic Substance, which becomes Astral Matter. It is also calledthe \"Fiery Serpent,\" as above described. If the student bears in mind that there is but One Universal Element, which is infinite,unborn, and undying, and that all the rest -- as in the world of phenomena -- are but so many various differentiated aspects andtransformations (correlations, they are now called) of that One, from Cosmical down to microcosmical effects, from super-human downto human and sub-human beings, the totality, in short, of objective existence -- then the first and chief difficulty will disappear andOccult Cosmology may be mastered.* All the Kabalists and Occultists, Eastern and Western, recognise (a)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the Egyptian as in the Indian theogony there was a concealed deity, the ONE, and the creative, androgynous god. Thus Shoo isthe god of creation and Osiris is, in his original primary form, the \"god whose name is unknown.\" (See Mariette's Abydos II., p. 63, andVol. III., pp. 413, 414, No. 1122.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 76 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the identity of \"Father-Mother\" with primordial AEther or Akasa, (Astral Light)*; and (b) its homogeneity before the evolution of the\"Son,\" cosmically Fohat, for it is Cosmic Electricity. \"Fohat hardens and scatters the seven brothers\" (Book III. Dzyan); which meansthat the primordial Electric Entity -- for the Eastern Occultists insist that Electricity is an Entity -- electrifies into life, and separatesprimordial stuff or pregenetic matter into atoms, themselves the source of all life and consciousness. \"There exists an universal agentunique of all forms and of life, that is called Od,** Ob, and Aour, active and passive, positive and negative, like day and night: it isthe first light in Creation\" (Eliphas Levi's Kabala):--- the first Light of the primordial Elohim -- the Adam, \"male and female\" -- or(scientifically) ELECTRICITY AND LIFE.(c) The ancients represented it by a serpent, for \"Fohat hisses as he glides hither and thither\" (in zigzags). The Kabala figures it withthe Hebrew letter Teth [[hebrew]], whose symbol is the serpent which played such a prominent part in the Mysteries. Its universal valueis nine, for it is the ninth letter of the alphabet and the ninth door of the fifty portals or gateways that lead to the concealed mysteriesof being. It is the magical agent par excellence, and designates in Hermetic philosophy \"Life infused into primordial matter,\" theessence that composes all things, and the spirit that determines their form. But there are two secret Hermetical operations, onespiritual, the other material-correlative, and for ever united. \"Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the solid . . .that which ascends from earth to heaven and descends again from heaven to earth.

It indicates the existence of things imperceptible to our physical senses which areof far greater importance, more real and more permanent, than those that appeal to these senses themselves.

This word of Hansa or esoterically \"hamsa\" is just such a case. Hamsa is equal to a-ham-sa, threewords meaning \"I am he\" (in English), while divided in still another way it will read \"So-ham,\" \"he (is) I\" -- Soham being equal to Sah,\"he,\" and aham, \"I,\" or \"I am he.\" In this alone is contained the universal mystery, the doctrine of the identity of man's essence withgod-essence, for him who understands the language of wisdom. Hence the glyph of, and the allegory about, Kalahansa (or hamsa),and the name given to Brahma neuter (later on, to the male Brahma) of \"Hansa-Vahana,\" he who uses the Hansa as his vehicle.\" Thesame word may be read \"Kalaham-sa\" or \"I am I\" in the eternity of Time, answering to the Biblical, or rather Zoroastrian \"I am that Iam.\" The same doctrine is found in the Kabala, as witness the following extract from an unpublished MS. by Mr. S. Liddell McGregorMathers, the learned Kabalist: \"The three pronouns [[hebrew]], Hoa, Atah, Ani; He, Thou, I; are used to symbolize the ideas ofMacroprosopus and Microprosopus in the Hebrew Qabalah. Hoa, \"He,\" is applied to the hidden and concealed Macroprosopus; Atah,\"Thou,\" to Microprosopus; and Ani, \"I,\" to the latter when He is represented as speaking. (See Lesser Holy Assembly, 204 et seq.) It isto be noted that each of these names consists of three letters, of which the letter Aleph [[hebrew]], A, forms the conclusion of the firstword Hoa, and the commencement of Atah and Ani, as if it were the connecting link between them. But [[hebrew]] is the symbol ofthe Unity and consequently of the unvarying Idea of the Divine operating through all these. But behind the [[hebrew]] in the nameHoa are the letters [[hebrew]] and [[hebrew]], the symbols of the numbers Six and Five, the Male and the Female, the Hexagram andthe Pentagram. And the numbers of these three words, Hoa Atah Ani, are 12, 406, and 61, which are resumed in the key numbers of3, 10, and 7, by the Qabalah of the Nine Chambers, which is a form of the exegetical rule of Temura.\"It is useless to attempt to explain the mystery in full. Materialists and the men of modern Science will never understand it, since, inorder------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 79 PRIMEVAL RADIATIONS FROM THE UNITY.to obtain clear perception of it, one has first of all to admit the postulate of a universally diffused, omnipresent, eternal Deity inNature; secondly, to have fathomed the mystery of electricity in its true essence; and thirdly, to credit man with being the septenarysymbol, on the terrestrial plane, of the One Great UNIT (the Logos), which is Itself the Seven-vowelled sign, the Breath crystallizedinto the WORD.* He who believes in all this, has also to believe in the multiple combination of the seven planets of Occultism and ofthe Kabala, with the twelve zodiacal signs; to attribute, as we do, to each planet and to each constellation an influence which, in thewords of Ely Star (a French Occultist), \"is proper to it, beneficent or maleficent, and this, after the planetary Spirit which rules it, who,in his turn, is capable of influencing men and things which are found in harmony with him and with which he has any affinity.\" Forthese reasons, and since few believe in the foregoing, all that can now be given is that in both cases the symbol of Hansa (whether \"I,\"\"He,\" Goose or Swan) is an important symbol, representing, for instance, Divine Wisdom, Wisdom in darkness beyond the reach ofmen. For all exoteric purposes, Hansa, as every Hindu knows, is a fabulous bird, which, when given milk mixed with water for its food(in the allegory) separated the two, drinking the milk and leaving the water; thus showing inherent wisdom -- milk standingsymbolically for spirit, and water for matter.That this allegory is very ancient and dates from the very earliest archaic period, is shown by the mention (in Bhagavata Purana) of acertain caste named \"Hamsa\" or \"Hansa,\" which was the \"one caste\" par excellence; when far back in the mists of a forgotten pastthere was among the Hindus only \"One Veda, One Deity, One Caste.\" There is also a range in the Himalayas, described in the oldbooks as being situated north of Mount Meru, called \"Hamsa,\" and connected with episodes pertaining to the history of religiousmysteries and initiations.

Brahma, the neuter, is called by them Kala-Hansa and Brahma, the male, Hansa-Vahana, becauseforsooth \"his vehicle or Vahan is a swan or goose\" (vide \"the Hindu Classical Dictionary.\") This is a purely exoteric gloss. Esotericallyand logically, if Brahma, the infinite, is all that is described by the Orientalists, namely, agreeably with the Vedantic texts, an abstractdeity in no way characterised by the description of any human attributes, and it is still maintained that he or it is called Kala-Hansa --then how can it ever become the Vahan of Brahma, the manifested finite god? It is quite the reverse. The \"Swan or goose\" (Hansa) isthe symbol of that male or temporary deity, as he, the emanation of the primordial Ray, is made to serve as a Vahan or vehicle forthat divine Ray, which otherwise could not manifest itself in the Universe, being, antiphrastically, itself an emanation of \"Darkness\" --for our human intellect, at any rate. It is Brahma, then, who is Kala-Hansa, and the Ray, the Hansa-Vahana.As to the strange symbol chosen, it is equally suggestive; the true mystic significance being the idea of a universal matrix, figured bythe primordial waters of the \"deep,\" or the opening for the reception, and subsequently for the issue, of that one ray (the Logos), whichcontains in itself the other seven procreative rays or powers (the logoi or builders). Hence the choice by the Rosecroix of the aquaticfowl -- whether swan or pelican,* with seven young ones for a symbol, modified and adapted to the religion of every country. En-Sophis called the \"Fiery Soul of the Pelican\" in the Book of Numbers.** (See Part II. \"The Hidden Deity and its Symbols and Glyphs.\")Appearing with every Manvantara as Narayan, or Swayambhuva (the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Whether the genus of the bird be cygnus, anser, or pelecanus, it is no matter, as it is an aquatic bird floating or moving on the waterslike the Spirit, and then issuing from those waters to give birth to other beings.

Because in the order of Cosmic evolution (as taught by the Occultist), theenergy that actuates matter after its first formation into atoms is generated on our plane by Cosmic heat; and because Kosmos, in thesense of dissociated matter, was not, before that period. The first primordial matter, eternal and coeval with Space, \"which has neithera beginning nor an end,\" is \"neither hot nor cold, but is of its own special nature,\" says the Commentary (Book II). Heat and cold arerelative qualities and pertain to the realms of the manifested worlds, which all proceed from the manifested Hyle, which, in itsabsolutely latent aspect, is referred to as the \"cold Virgin,\" and when awakened to life, as the \"Mother.\" The ancient WesternCosmogonic myths state that at first there was but cold mist which was the Father, and the prolific slime (the Mother, Ilus or Hyle), fromwhich crept forth the Mundane snake-matter, (Isis, vol. i., p. 146). Primordial matter, then, before it emerges from the plane of thenever-manifesting, and awakens to the thrill of action under the impulse of Fohat, is but \"a cool Radiance, colourless, formless,tasteless, and devoid of every quality and aspect.\" Even such are her first-born, the \"four sons,\" who \"are One, and become Seven,\" --the entities, by whose qualifications and names the ancient Eastern Occultists called the four of the seven primal \"centres of Forces,\"or atoms, that develop later into the great Cosmic \"Elements,\" now divided into the seventy or so sub-elements, known to science. Thefour primal natures of the first Dhyan Chohans, are the so-called (for want of better terms) \"Akasic,\" \"Ethereal,\" \"Watery,\" and \"Fiery,\"answering, in the terminology of practical occultism, to scientific definitions of gases, which, to convey a clear idea to both Occultistsand laymen, must be defined as Parahydrogenic,* Paraoxygenic, Oxyhydrogenic, and Ozonic, or perhaps Nitr-ozonic; the latter forcesor gases (in Occultism, supersensuous, yet atomic substances) being the most effective and active when energising on the plane ofmore grossly differentiated matter.** These are both electro-positive and electro-negative.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* [[para]], \"beyond,\" outside.** Each of these and many more are probably the missing links of chemistry.

But it is also suggestive of something else. It shows that the ancientswere acquainted with that which is now the puzzle of many scientists and especially of astronomers: the cause of the first ignition ofmatter or the world-stuff, the paradox of the heat produced by the refrigerative contraction and other such Cosmic riddles. For it pointsunmistakeably to a knowledge by the ancients of such phenomena. \"There is heat internal and heat external in every atom,\" say themanuscript Commentaries, to which the writer has had access; \"the breath of the Father (or Spirit) and the breath (or heat) of theMother (matter);\" and they give explanations which show that the modern theory of the extinction of the solar fires by loss of heatthrough radiation, is erroneous. The assumption is false even on the Scientists' own admission. For as Professor Newcomb points out(Popular Astronomy, pp. 506-508), \"by losing heat, a gaseous body contracts, and the heat generated by the contraction exceeds thatwhich it had to lose in order to produce the contraction.\" This paradox, that a body gets hotter as the shrinking produced by its gettingcolder is greater, led to long disputes. The surplus of heat, it was argued, was lost by radiation, and to assume that the temperature isnot lowered pari passu with a decrease of volume under a constant pressure, is to set at nought the law of Charles (Nebular Theory,Winchell). Contraction develops heat, it is true; but contraction (from cooling) is incapable of developing the whole amount of heat atany time existing in the mass, or even of maintaining a body at a constant temperature, etc. Professor Winchell tries to reconcile theparadox -- only a seeming one in fact, as------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 85 CONSCIOUS ELECTRICITY.Homer Lanes proved, -- by suggesting \"something besides heat.\" \"May it not be,\" he asks, \"simply a repulsion among the molecules,which varies according to some law of the distance?\" But even this will be found irreconcileable, unless this \"something besides heat\"is ticketed \"Causeless Heat,\" the \"Breath of Fire,\" the all-creative Force Plus ABSOLUTE INTELLIGENCE, which physical science isnot likely to accept.However it may be, the reading of this Stanza shows it, notwithstanding its archaic phraseology, to be more scientific than evenmodern science.-------STANZA III. -- Continued.12.

Some faint idea of the nature of Fohat may begathered from the appellation \"Cosmic Electricity\" sometimes applied to it; but to the commonly known properties of electricity must,in this case, be added others, including intelligence.

By theone a man goes never to come back, by the other he returns.\" Now these names, \"Fire,\" \"Flame,\" \"Day,\" the \"bright fortnight,\" etc., as\"Smoke,\" \"Night,\" and so on, leading only to the end of the lunar path are incomprehensible without a knowledge of Esotericism.These are all names of various deities which preside over the Cosmo-psychic Powers. We often speak of the Hierarchy of \"Flames\" (seeBook II.) of the \"Sons of Fire,\" etc. Sankaracharya the greatest of the Esoteric masters of India, says that fire means a deity whichpresides over Time (kala). The able translator of Bhagavatgita, Kashinath Trimbak Telang, M.A., of Bombay, confesses he has \"noclear notion of the meaning of these verses\" (p. 81, footnote). It seems quite clear, on the contrary, to him who knows the occultdoctrine. With these verses the mystic sense of the solar and lunar symbols are connected: the Pitris are lunar deities and ourancestors, because they created the physical man.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 87 THE SEVEN MYSTIC SENSES.The Agnishwatha, the Kumara (the seven mystic sages), are solar deities, though the former are Pitris also; and these are the\"fashioners of the Inner Man.\" (See Book II.) They are:--\"The Sons of Fire\" -- because they are the first Beings (in the Secret Doctrine they are called \"Minds\"), evolved from Primordial Fire.\"The Lord is a consuming Fire\" (Deuteronomy iv. 24); \"The Lord (Christos) shall be revealed with his mighty angels in flaming fire\" (2Thessal. i. 7, 8). The Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles like \"cloven tongues of fire,\" (Acts ii. v. 3); Vishnu will return on Kalki, theWhite Horse, as the last Avatar amid fire and flames; and Sosiosh will be brought down equally on a White Horse in a \"tornado offire.\" \"And I saw heaven open and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him . . . . is called the Word of God,\" (Rev. xix. 13)amid flaming Fire. Fire is AEther in its purest form, and hence is not regarded as matter, but it is the unity of Aether -- the secondmanifested deity -- in its universality. But there are two \"Fires\" and a distinction is made between them in the Occult teachings. Thefirst, or the purely Formless and invisible Fire concealed in the Central Spiritual Sun, is spoken of as \"triple\" (metaphysically); whilethe Fire of the manifested Kosmos is Septenary, throughout both the Universe and our Solar System. \"The fire or knowledge burns upall action on the plane of illusion,\" says the commentary. \"Therefore, those who have acquired it and are emancipated, are called'Fires.' \" Speaking of the seven senses symbolised as Hotris, priests, the Brahmana says in Anugita: \"Thus these seven (senses, smelland taste, and colour, and sound, etc., etc.) are the causes of emancipation;\" and the commentator adds: \"It is from these seven fromwhich the Self is to be emancipated. 'I' (am here devoid of qualities) must mean the Self, not the Brahmana who speaks.\" (\"SacredBooks of the East,\" ed. by Max Muller, Vol. VIII., 278.)(b) The expression \"All is One Number, issued from No Number\" relates again to that universal and philosophical tenet just explainedin Stanza III. (Comm. 4). That which is absolute is of course No Number; but in its later significance it has an application in Space asin Time. It means that not only every increment of time is part of a larger increment, up to the most indefinitely prolonged durationconceivable by the human intellect, but also that no manifested thing can------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 88 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.be thought of except as part of a larger whole: the total aggregate being the One manifested Universe that issues from theunmanifested or Absolute -- called Non-Being or \"No-Number,\" to distinguish it from BEING or \"the One Number.\"-------STANZA IV. -- Continued.(2) LEARN WHAT WE, WHO DESCEND FROM THE PRIMORDIAL SEVEN, WE, WHO ARE BORN FROM THE PRIMORDIAL FLAME,HAVE LEARNED FROM OUR FATHERS (a).(a) This is explained in Book II., and this name, \"Primordial Flame,\" corroborates what is said in the first paragraph of the precedingcommentary on Stanza IV.The distinction between the \"Primordial\" and the subsequent seven Builders is this: The former are the Ray and direct emanation ofthe first \"Sacred Four,\" the Tetraktis, that is, the eternally Self-Existent One (Eternal in Essence note well, not in manifestation, anddistinct from the universal ONE). Latent, during Pralaya, and active, during Manvantara, the \"Primordial\" proceed from \"Father-Mother\" (Spirit-Hyle, or Ilus); whereas the other manifested Quaternary and the Seven proceed from the Mother alone. It is the latterwho is the immaculate Virgin-Mother, who is overshadowed, not impregnated, by the Universal MYSTERY -- when she emerges fromher state of Laya or undifferentiated condition. In reality, they are, of course, all one; but their aspects on the various planes of beingare different.

AND FROM THE DIVINE MAN EMANATED THE FORMS, THE SPARKS, THE SACRED ANIMALS, ANDTHE MESSENGERS OF THE SACRED FATHERS (the Pitris) WITHIN THE HOLY FOUR.*(a) This relates to the sacred Science of the Numerals: so sacred, indeed, and so important in the study of Occultism that the subjectcan hardly be skimmed, even in such a large work as the present. It is on the Hierarchies and correct numbers of these Beings invisible(to us) except upon very rare occasions, that the mystery of the whole Universe is built. The Kumaras, for instance, are called the\"Four\" though in reality seven in number, because Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana and Sanat-Kumara are the chief Vaidhatra (theirpatronymic name), as they spring from the \"four-fold mystery.\" To make the whole clearer we have to turn for our illustrations to tenetsmore familiar to some of our readers, namely, the Brahminical.According to Manu, Hiranyagarbha is Brahma the first male formed by the undiscernible Causeless CAUSE in a \"Golden Eggresplendent as the Sun,\" as states the Hindu Classical Dictionary. \"Hiranyagarbha\" means the golden, or rather the \"Effulgent Womb\"or Egg. The meaning tallies awkwardly with the epithet of \"male.\" Surely the esoteric meaning of the sentence is clear enough. In theRig Veda it is said:-- \"THAT, the one Lord of all beings . . . . the one animating principle of gods and man,\" arose, in the beginning,in the Golden Womb, Hiranyagarbha -- which is the Mundane Egg or sphere of our Universe. That Being is surely androgynous, andthe allegory of Brahma separating into two and recreating in one of his halves (the female Vach) himself as Viraj, is a proof of it.\"The One from the Egg, the Six and the Five,\" give the number 1065, the value of the first-born (later on the male and femaleBrahma-Prajapati), who answers to the numbers 7, and 14, and 21 respectively. The Prajapati are, like the Sephiroth, only seven,including the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The 4, represented in the Occult numerals by the Tetraktis, the Sacred or Perfect Square, is a Sacred Number with the mystics ofevery nation and race. It has one and the same significance in Brahmanism, Buddhism, the Kabala and in the Egyptian, Chaldeanand other numerical systems.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 90 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.synthetic Sephira of the triad from which they spring. Thus from Hiranyagarbha or Prajapati, the triune (primeval Vedic Trimurti, Agni,Vayu, and Surya), emanate the other seven, or again ten, if we separate the first three which exist in one, and one in three, all,moreover, being comprehended within that one \"supreme\" Parama, called Guhya or \" secret,\" and Sarvatma, the \"Super-Soul.\" \"Theseven Lords of Being lie concealed in Sarvatma like thoughts in one brain.\" So are the Sephiroth. It is either seven when countingfrom the upper Triad headed by Kether, or ten -- exoterically. In the Mahabharata the Prajapati are 21 in number, or ten, six, and five(1065), thrice seven.*(b) \"The Three, the One, the Four, the One, the Five\" (in their totality -- twice seven) represent 31415 -- the numerical hierarchy of theDhyan-Chohans of various orders, and of the inner or circumscribed world.** When placed on the boundary of the great circle of \"Passnot\" (see Stanza V.), called also the Dhyanipasa, the \"rope of the Angels,\" the \"rope\" that hedges off the phenomenal from thenoumenal Kosmos, (not falling within the range of our present objective consciousness); this number, when not enlarged bypermutation and expansion, is ever 31415 anagrammatically and Kabalistically, being both the number of the circle and the mysticSvastica, the twice seven once more; for whatever way the two sets of figures are counted, when added separately, one figure afteranother, whether crossways, from right or from left, they will always yield fourteen. Mathematically they represent the well-knowncalculation, namely, that the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle is as 1 to 3.1415, or the value of the (pi), as thisratio is called -- the symbol being always used in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the Kabala the same numbers are a value of Jehovah, viz., 1065, since the numerical values of the three letters which composehis name -- Jod, Vau and twice He -- are respectively 10 ( [[hebrew]]), 6 ( [[hebrew]]) and 5 ( [[hebrew]]); or again thrice seven, 21.\"Ten is the Mother of the Soul, for Life and Light are therein united,\" says Hermes. \"For number one is born of the Spirit and thenumber ten from matter (chaos, feminine); the unity has made the ten, the ten the unity\" (Book of the Keys).

It came to the Jews fromChaldaea.

This set of figures must have the same meaning, since the 1 : 314,159, and then again 1 : 3 :1,415,927 are worked out in the secret calculations to express the various cycles and ages of the \"first born,\" or 311,040,000,000,000with fractions, and yield the same 13,415 by a process we are not concerned with at present. And it may be shown that Mr. RalstonSkinner, author of The Source of Measures, reads the Hebrew word Alhim in the same number values, by omitting, as said, the ciphersand by permutation -- 13,514: since [[hebrew]] (a) is 1 : [[hebrew]] (l) is 3 (or 30); [[hebrew]] (h) is 5; [[hebrew]] (i) 1 for 10; and[[hebrew]] (m) is 4 (40), and anagrammatically -- 31,415 as explained by him.Thus, while in the metaphysical world, the circle with the one central Point in it has no number, and is called Anupadaka (parentlessand numberless) -- viz., it can fall under no calculation, -- in the manifested world the mundane Egg or Circle is circumscribed withinthe groups called the Line, the Triangle, the Pentacle, the second Line and the Cube (or 13514); and when the Point havinggenerated a Line, thus becomes a diameter which stands for the androgynous Logos, then the figures become 31415, or a triangle, aline, a cube, the second line, and a pentacle. \"When the Son separates from the Mother he becomes the Father,\" the diameterstanding for Nature, or the feminine principle. Therefore it is said: \"In the world of being, the one Point fructifies the Line -- the VirginMatrix of Kosmos (the egg-shaped zero) -- and the immaculate Mother gives birth to the form that combines all forms.\" Prajapati iscalled the first procreating male, and \"his Mother's husband.\"* This gives the key-note to all the later divine sons from immaculatemothers. It is greatly corroborated by the significant fact that Anna (the name of the Mother of the Virgin Mary) now represented by theRoman Catholic church as having given birth to her daughter in an immaculate way (\"Mary conceived without sin\"), is derived fromthe Chaldean Ana, heaven, or Astral Light, Anima Mundi; whence Anaitia, Devi-durga, the wife of Siva, is also called Annapurna,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We find the same expression in Egypt. Mout signifies, for one thing, \"Mother,\" and shows the character assigned to her in the triad ofthat country. \"She was no less the mother than the wife of Ammon, one of the principle titles of the god being \"the husband of hismother.\" The goddess Mout, or Mut, is addressed as \"our lady,\" the \"queen of Heaven\" and of \"the Earth,\" thus \"sharing these titleswith the other mother goddesses, Isis, Hathor, etc.\" (Maspero).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 92 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and Kanya, the Virgin; \"Uma-Kanya\" being her esoteric name, and meaning the \"Virgin of light,\" Astral Light in one of itsmultitudinous aspects.(c) The Devas, Pitris, Rishis; the Suras and the Asuras; the Daityas and Adityas; the Danavas and Gandharvas, etc., etc., have all theirsynonyms in our Secret Doctrine, as well as in the Kabala and the Hebrew Angelology; but it is useless to give their ancient names, asit would only create confusion. Many of these may be also found now, even in the Christian hierarchy of divine and celestial powers.All those Thrones and Dominions, Virtues and Principalities, Cherubs, Seraphs and demons, the various denizens of the SiderealWorld, are the modern copies of archaic prototypes. The very symbolism in their names, when transliterated and arranged in Greekand Latin, are sufficient to show it, as will be proved in several cases further on.The \"Sacred Animals\" are found in the Bible as well as in the Kabala, and they have their meaning (a very profound one, too) on thepage of the origins of Life. In the Sepher Jezirah it is stated that \"God engraved in the Holy Four the throne of his glory, the Ophanim(Wheels or the World-Spheres), the Seraphim,* the Sacred Animals, and the ministering angels, and from these three (the Air, Water,and Fire or Ether) he formed his habitation.\" Thus was the world made \"through three Seraphim -- Sepher, Saphar, and Sipur,\" or\"through Number, Numbers, and Numbered.\" With the astronomical key these \"Sacred Animals\" become the signs of the Zodiac.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This is the literal translation from the IXth and Xth Sections: \"Ten numbers without what? One: the spirit of the living God . . . . wholiveth in eternities! Voice and Spirit and Word, and this is the Holy Spirit. Two: Spirit out of Spirit.

To this Hierarchy correspond the actual types into which humanity may be divided; for humanity, as awhole, is in reality a materialized though as yet imperfect expression thereof. The \"army of the Voice\" is a term closely connectedwith the mystery of Sound and Speech, as an effect and corollary of the cause -- Divine Thought. As beautifully expressed by P.Christian, the learned author of \"The History of Magic\" and of \"L'Homme Rouge des Tuileries,\" the word spoken by, as well as thename of, every individual largely determine his future fate. Why? Because ---- \"When our Soul (mind) creates or evokes a thought, the representative sign of that thought is self-engraved upon the astral fluid,which is the receptacle and, so to say, the mirror of all the manifestations of being.\"The sign expresses the thing: the thing is the (hidden or occult) virtue of the sign.\"To pronounce a word is to evoke a thought, and make it present: the magnetic potency of the human speech is the commencementof every manifestation in the Occult World. To utter a Name is not only to define a Being (an Entity), but to place it under andcondemn it through the emission of the Word (Verbum), to the influence of one or more Occult potencies. Things are, for every one ofus, that which it (the Word) makes them while naming them. The Word (Verbum) or the speech of every man is, quite unconsciously tohimself, a BLESSING or a CURSE; this is why our present ignorance about the properties or attributes of the IDEA as well as about theattributes and properties of MATTER, is often fatal to us.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The literal signification of the word is, among the Eastern Occultists of the North, a circular wind, whirlwind; but in this instance, it isa term to denote the ceaseless and eternal Cosmic Motion; or rather the Force that moves it, which Force is tacitly accepted as theDeity but never named. It is the eternal Karana, the ever-acting Cause.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 94 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"Yes, names (and words) are either BENEFICENT or MALEFICENT; they are, in a certain sense, either venomous or health-giving,according to the hidden influences attached by Supreme Wisdom to their elements, that is to say, to the LETTERS which composethem, and the NUMBERS correlative to these letters.\"This is strictly true as an esoteric teaching accepted by all the Eastern Schools of Occultism. In the Sanskrit, as also in the Hebrew andall other alphabets, every letter has its occult meaning and its rationale; it is a cause and an effect of a preceding cause and acombination of these very often produces the most magical effect. The vowels, especially, contain the most occult and formidablepotencies. The Mantras (esoterically, magical rather than religious) are chanted by the Brahmins and so are the Vedas and otherScriptures.The \"Army of the Voice,\" is the prototype of the \"Host of the Logos,\" or the \"WORD\" of the Sepher Jezirah, called in the SecretDoctrine \"the One Number issued from No-Number\" -- the One Eternal Principle. The esoteric theogony begins with the One,manifested, therefore not eternal in its presence and being, if eternal in its essence; the number of the numbers and numbered -- thelatter proceeding from the Voice, the feminine Vach, Satarupa \"of the hundred forms,\" or Nature. It is from this number 10, or creativenature, the Mother (the occult cypher, or \"nought,\" ever procreating and multiplying in union with the Unit \"I,\" one, or the Spirit ofLife), that the whole Universe proceeded.In the Anugita a conversation is given (ch. vi., 15) between a Brahmana and his wife, on the origin of Speech and its occultproperties.* The wife asks how Speech came into existence, and which was prior to the other, Speech or Mind. The Brahmana tellsher that the Apana (inspirational breath) becoming lord, changes that intelligence, which does not understand Speech or Words, intothe state of Apana, and thus opens the mind. Thereupon he tells her a story, a dialogue between Speech and Mind. \"Both went tothe Self of Being (i.e., to the individual Higher Self, as Nilakantha thinks, to Prajapati, according to the commentator Arjuna Misra),and asked him to destroy their doubts and decide which of them preceded and was superior to the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Anugita forms part of the Asvamedha Parvan of the \"Mahabharata.\" The translator of the Bhagavatgita, edited by Max Muller,regards it as a continuation of the Bhagavatgita.

To this the lord said: 'Mind is Superior.' But Speech answered the Self of Being, by saying: 'I verily yield (you) your desires,'meaning that by speech he acquired what he desired. Thereupon again, the Self told her that there are two minds, the 'movable' andthe 'immovable.' 'The immovable is with me,' he said, 'the movable is in your dominion' (i.e. of Speech) on the plane of matter. Tothat you are superior. But inasmuch, O beautiful one, as you came personally to speak to me (in the way you did, i.e. proudly),therefore, O, Sarasvati! you shall never speak after (hard) exhalation.\" \"The goddess Speech\" (Sarasvati, a later form or aspect ofVach, the goddess also of secret learning or Esoteric Wisdom), \"verily, dwelt always between the Prana and the Apana. But O nobleone! going with the Apana wind (vital air), though impelled, without the Prana (expirational breath), she ran up to Prajapati (Brahma),saying, 'Be pleased, O venerable sir!' Then the Prana appeared again, nourishing Speech. And, therefore, Speech never speaks after(hard or inspirational) exhalation. It is always noisy or noiseless. Of these two, the noiseless is the superior to the noisy (Speech). . . . .The (speech) which is produced in the body by means of the Prana, and which then goes (is transformed) into Apana, and thenbecoming assimilated with the Udana (physical organs of Speech) . . . then finally dwells in the Samana ('at the navel in the form ofsound, as the material cause of all words,' says Arjuna Misra). So Speech formerly spoke. Hence the mind is distinguished by reason ofits being immovable, and the Goddess (Speech) by reason of her being movable.\"This allegory is at the root of the Occult law, which prescribes silence upon the knowledge of certain secret and invisible thingsperceptible only to the spiritual mind (the 6th sense), and which cannot be expressed by \"noisy\" or uttered speech. This chapter ofAnugita explains, says Arjuna Misra, Pranayama, or regulation of the breath in Yoga practices. This mode, however, without theprevious acquisition of, or at least full understanding of the two higher senses, of which there are seven, as will be shown, pertainsrather to the lower Yoga. The Hatha so called was and still is discountenanced by the Arhats. It is injurious to the health and alonecan never develop into Raj Yoga. This story is quoted to show how inseparably connected are, in the metaphysics of old, intelligentbeings, or rather \"Intelligences,\" with every sense or------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 96 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.function whether physical or mental. The Occult claim that there are seven senses in man, as in nature, as there are seven states ofconsciousness, is corroborated in the same work, chapter vii., on Pratyahara (the restraint and regulation of the senses, Pranayamabeing that of the \"vital winds\" or breath). The Brahmana speaks in it \"of the institution of the seven sacrificial Priests (Hotris). He says:\"The nose and the eyes, and the tongue, and the skin and the ear as the fifth (or smell, sight, taste, touch and hearing), mind andunderstanding are the seven sacrificial priests separately stationed\"; and which \"dwelling in a minute space (still) do not perceiveeach other\" on this sensuous plane, none of them except mind. For mind says: \"The nose smells not without me, the eye does nottake in colour, etc., etc. I am the eternal chief among all elements (i.e., senses). Without me, the senses never shine, like an emptydwelling, or like fires the flames of which are extinct. Without me, all beings, like fuel half dried and half moist, fail to apprehendqualities or objects even with the senses exerting themselves.\"*This, of course, with regard only to mind on the sensuous plane. Spiritual mind (the upper portion or aspect of the impersonalMANAS) takes no cognisance of the senses in physical man. How well the ancients were acquainted with the correlation of forces andall the recently discovered phenomena of mental and physical faculties and functions, with many more mysteries also -- may be foundin reading chapters vii. and viii. of this (in philosophy and mystic learning) priceless work. See the quarrel of the senses about theirrespective superiority and their taking the Brahman, the lord of all creatures, for their arbiter. \"You are all greatest and not greatest,\" orsuperior to objects, as A. Misra says, none being independent of the other. \"You are all possessed of one another's qualities. All aregreatest in their own spheres and all support one another. There is one unmoving (life-wind or breath, the 'Yoga inhalation,' so called,which is the breath of the One or Higher SELF). That is the (or my) own Self, accumulated in numerous (forms).\"This Breath, Voice, Self or \"Wind\" (pneuma?) is the Synthesis of the Seven Senses, noumenally all minor deities and esoterically --the septenary and the \"Army of the VOICE.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This shows the modern metaphysicians, added to all past and present Haegels, Berkeleys, Schopenhauers, Hartmanns, HerbertSpencers, and even the modern Hylo-Idealists to boot, no better than the pale copyists of hoary antiquity.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 97 NATURE, THE PERPETUAL MOTION.(b) Next we see Cosmic matter scattering and forming itself into elements; grouped into the mystic four within the fifth element --Ether, the lining of Akasa, the Anima Mundi or Mother of Kosmos. \"Dots, Lines, Triangles, Cubes, Circles\" and finally \"Spheres\" -- whyor how? Because, says the Commentary, such is the first law of Nature, and because Nature geometrizes universally in all hermanifestations. There is an inherent law -- not only in the primordial, but also in the manifested matter of our phenomenal plane -- bywhich Nature correlates her geometrical forms, and later, also, her compound elements; and in which there is no place for accident orchance. It is a fundamental law in Occultism, that there is no rest or cessation of motion in Nature.* That which seems rest is only thechange of one form into another; the change of substance going hand in hand with that of form -- as we are taught in Occult physics,which thus seem to have anticipated the discovery of the \"Conservation of matter\" by a considerable time. Says the ancientCommentary** to Stanza IV.:--\"The Mother is the fiery Fish of Life. She scatters her spawn and the Breath (Motion) heats and quickens it. The grains (of spawn) aresoon attracted to each other and form the curds in the Ocean (of Space).

The ancient Commentary gives an allegory and explains it:--\"Eight houses were built by Mother. Eight houses for her Eight Divine sons; four large and four small ones. Eight brilliant suns,according to their age and merits. Bal-ilu (Martanda) was not satisfied, though his house was the largest. He began (to work) as thehuge elephants do. He breathed (drew in) into his stomach the vital airs of his brothers. He sought to devour them. The larger fourwere far away; far, on the margin of their kingdom.* They were not robbed (affected), and laughed. Do your worst, Sir, you cannotreach us, they said. But the smaller wept. They complained to the Mother. She exiled Bal-i-lu to the centre of her Kingdom, fromwhence he could not move. (Since then) he (only) watches and threatens. He pursues them, turning slowly around himself, theyturning swiftly from him, and he following from afar the direction in which his brothers move on the path that encircles their houses.**From that day he feeds on the sweat of the Mother's body. He fills himself with her breath and refuse. Therefore, she rejected him.\"Thus the \"rejected Son\" being our Sun, evidently, as shown above, the \"Sun-Sons\" refer not only to our planets but to the heavenlybodies in general.

The error only seems important, but was not so in practical results, if the ancientastrologers replaced Uranus by the Sun, which is a central Star relatively motionless, turning only on its axis and regulating time andmeasure; and which cannot be turned aside from its true functions.\" . . . . . .

He is called indifferently the Son of Dyaus and of Aditi, because nodistinction is made with reference to, or scope allowed for, the esoteric meaning.

This \"One Element\" is called figuratively \"FIRE.\" The Vedas (Aitareya-Brahmana of Haug also; p. i) teach \"that the fireverily is all the deities.\" (Narada in Anugita).The meaning of the allegory is plain, for we have both the Dzyan Commentary and modern science to explain it, though the twodiffer in more than one particular.

Having evolved from Cosmic Space, andbefore the final formation of the primaries and the annulation of the planetary nebula, the Sun, we are taught, drew into the depthsof its mass all the Cosmic vitality he could, threatening to engulf his weaker \"brothers\" before the law of attraction and repulsion wasfinally adjusted; after which he began feeding on \"The Mother's refuse and sweat\"; in other words, on those portions of Ether (the\"breath of the Universal Soul\") of the existence and constitution of which science is as yet absolutely ignorant. A theory of this kindhaving been propounded by Sir William Grove (see \"Correlation of the Physical Forces,\" 1843, p. 81; and \"Address to the BritishAssociation, 1866\"), who theorized that the systems \"are gradually changing by atmospheric additions or subtractions, or by accretionsand diminutions arising from nebular substances\" . . . and again that \"the Sun may condense gaseous matter as it travels in Spaceand so heat may be produced\" -- the archaic teaching seems scientific enough, even in this age.* Mr. W. Mattieu Williams suggestedthat the diffused matter or Ether which is the recipient of the heat radiations of the Universe is thereby drawn into the depths of thesolar mass. Expelling thence the previously condensed and thermally exhausted Ether, it becomes compressed and gives up its heat,to be in turn itself driven out in a rarified and cooled state, to absorb a fresh supply of heat, which he supposes to be in this way takenup by the Ether, and again concentrated and redistributed by the Suns of the Universe.**This is about as close an approximation to the Occult teachings as Science ever imagined; for Occultism explains it by \"the deadbreath\" given back by Martanda and his feeding on the \"sweat and refuse\" of \"Mother Space.\" What could affect Neptune,*** Saturnand Jupiter,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Very similar ideas in Mr. W.

They evolve into Manvantaric life from primaeval Chaos (now the noumenon of irresolvable nebulae) by aggregation andaccumulation of the primary differentiations of the eternal matter, according to the beautiful expression in the Commentary, \"Thus theSons of Light clothed themselves in the fabric of Darkness.\" They are called allegorically \"the Heavenly Snails,\" on account of their(to us) formless INTELLIGENCES inhabiting unseen their starry and planetary homes, and, so to speak, carrying them as the snails doalong with themselves in their revolution.

As it is the Lipika who project into objectivity from the passive Universal Mind the ideal plan of the universe,upon which the \"Builders\" reconstruct the Kosmos after every Pralaya, it is they who stand parallel to the Seven Angels of thePresence, whom the Christians recognise in the Seven \"Planetary Spirits\" or the \"Spirits of the Stars;\" for thus it is they who are thedirect amanuenses of the Eternal Ideation -- or, as called by Plato, the \"Divine Thought.\" The Eternal Record is no fantastic dream,for we meet with the same records in the world of gross matter. \"A shadow never falls upon a wall without leaving thereupon apermanent trace which might be made visible by resorting to proper processes,\" says Dr. Draper. . . . \"The portraits of our friends orlandscape-views may be hidden on the sensitive surface from the eye, but they are ready to make their appearance as soon as properdevelopers are resorted to. A spectre is concealed on a silver or a glassy surface, until, by our necromancy, we make it come forth intothe visible world. Upon the walls of our most private apartments, where we think the eye of intrusion is altogether shut out, and ourretirement can never be profaned, there exist the vestiges of all our acts, silhouettes of whatever we have done.\"** Drs. Jevons andBabbage believe that every thought, displacing the particles of the brain and setting them in motion, scatters them throughout theUniverse, and they think that \"each particle of the existing matter must be a register of all that has happened.\" (Principles of Science,Vol. II. p. 455.) Thus the ancient doctrine has begun to acquire rights of citizenship in the speculations of the scientific world.The forty \"Assessors\" who stand in the region of Amenti as the accusers of the Soul before Osiris, belong to the same class of deities asthe Lipika, and might stand paralleled, were not the Egyptian gods so[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* These are the four \"Immortals\" which are mentioned in Atharva Veda as the \"Watchers\" or Guardians of the four quarters of the sky(see ch. lxxvi., 1-4, et seq.).** \"Conflict between Religion and Science.\" -- Draper, pp. 132 and 133.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 105 THE DIVINE RECORDERS.little understood in their esoteric meaning.

THE PRIMORDIAL SEVEN, THE FIRST SEVEN BREATHS OF THE DRAGON OF WISDOM, PRODUCE IN THEIR TURN FROMTHEIR HOLY CIRCUMGYRATING BREATHS THE FIERY WHIRLWIND (a).COMMENTARY.(a) This is, perhaps, the most difficult of all the Stanzas to explain. Its language is comprehensible only to him who is thoroughlyversed in Eastern allegory and its purposely obscure phraseology. The question will surely be asked, \"Do the Occultists believe in allthese 'Builders,' 'Lipika,' and 'Sons of Light' as Entities, or are they merely imageries?\" To this the answer is given as plainly: \"Afterdue allowance for the imagery of personified Powers, we must admit the existence of these Entities, if we would not reject theexistence of spiritual humanity within physical mankind. For the hosts of these Sons of Light and 'Mind-born Sons' of the firstmanifested Ray of the UNKNOWN ALL, are the very root of spiritual man.\" Unless we want to believe the unphilosophical dogma of aspecially created soul for every human birth -- a fresh supply of these pouring in daily, since \"Adam\" -- we have to admit the occultteachings. This will be explained in its place. Let us see, now, what may be the occult meaning of this Stanza.The Doctrine teaches that, in order to become a divine, fully conscious god, -- aye, even the highest -- the Spiritual primevalINTELLIGENCES must pass through the human stage. And when we say human, this does not apply merely to our terrestrialhumanity, but to the mortals that inhabit any world, i.e., to those Intelligences that have reached the appropriate equilibrium betweenmatter and spirit, as we have now, since the middle point of the Fourth Root Race of the Fourth Round was passed. Each Entity musthave won for itself the right of becoming divine, through self-experience. Hegel, the great German thinker, must have known or sensedintuitionally this truth when saying, as he did, that the Unconscious evolved the Universe only \"in the hope of attaining clear self-consciousness,\" of becoming, in other words, MAN; for this is also the secret meaning of the usual Puranic phrase about------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 107 NO MAN -- NO GOD.Brahma being constantly \"moved by the desire to create.\" This explains also the hidden Kabalistic meaning of the saying: \"TheBreath becomes a stone; the stone, a plant; the plant, an animal; the animal, a man; the man, a spirit; and the spirit, a god.\" TheMind-born Sons, the Rishis, the Builders, etc., were all men -- of whatever forms and shapes -- in other worlds and the precedingManvantaras.This subject, being so very mystical, is therefore the most difficult to explain in all its details and bearings; since the whole mystery ofevolutionary creation is contained in it. A sentence or two in it vividly recalls to mind similar ones in the Kabala and the phraseologyof the King Psalmist (civ.), as both, when speaking of God, show him making the wind his messenger and his \"ministers a flaming fire.\"But in the Esoteric doctrine it is used figuratively. The \"fiery Wind\" is the incandescent Cosmic dust which only follows magnetically,as the iron filings follow the magnet, the directing thought of the \"Creative Forces.\" Yet, this cosmic dust is something more; for everyatom in the Universe has the potentiality of self-consciousness in it, and is, like the Monads of Leibnitz, a Universe in itself, and foritself. It is an atom and an angel.In this connection it should be noted that one of the luminaries of the modern Evolutionist School, Mr. A. R. Wallace, when discussingthe inadequacy of \"natural selection\" as the sole factor in the development of physical man, practically concedes the whole pointhere discussed. He holds that the evolution of man was directed and furthered by superior Intelligences, whose agency is a necessaryfactor in the scheme of Nature. But once the operation of these Intelligences is admitted in one place, it is only a logical deduction toextend it still further. No hard and fast line can be drawn.-------STANZA V. -- Continued.2.

Dzyu is the one real (magical) knowledge, or Occult Wisdom; which, dealingwith eternal truths and primal causes, becomes almost omnipotence when applied in the right direction. Its antithesis is Dzyu-mi, thatwhich deals with illusions and false appearances only, as in our exoteric modern sciences. In this case, Dzyu is the expression of thecollective Wisdom of the Dhyani-Buddhas.(b) As the reader is supposed not to be acquainted with the Dhyani-Buddhas, it is as well to say at once that, according to theOrientalists, there are five Dhyanis who are the \"celestial\" Buddhas, of whom the human Buddhas are the manifestations in the worldof form and matter. Esoterically, however, the Dhyani-Buddhas are seven, of whom five only have hitherto manifested,* and two are tocome in the sixth and seventh Root-races. They are, so to speak, the eternal prototypes of the Buddhas who appear on this earth, eachof whom has his particular divine prototype. So, for instance, Amitabha is the Dhyani-Buddha of Gautama Sakyamuni, manifestingthrough him whenever this great Soul incarnates on earth as He did in Tzon-kha-pa.** As the synthesis of the seven Dhyani-Buddhas,Avalokiteswara was the first Buddha (the Logos), so Amitabha is the inner \"God\" of Gautama, who, in China, is called Amita(-Buddha).They are, as Mr. Rhys Davids[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See A. P. Sinnett's \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" 5th annotated edition, pp. 171-173.** The first and greatest Reformer who founded the \"Yellow-Caps,\" Gyalugpas.

They are the \"Buddhas ofContemplation,\" and are all Anupadaka (parentless), i.e., self-born of divine essence. The exoteric teaching which says that everyDhyani-Buddha has the faculty of creating from himself, an equally celestial son -- a Dhyani-Bodhisattva -- who, after the decease ofthe Manushi (human) Buddha, has to carry out the work of the latter, rests on the fact that owing to the highest initiation performed byone overshadowed by the \"Spirit of Buddha\" -- (who is credited by the Orientalists with having created the five Dhyani-Buddhas!), -- acandidate becomes virtually a Bodhisattva, created such by the High Initiator.(c) Fohat, being one of the most, if not the most important character in esoteric Cosmogony, should be minutely described. As in theoldest Grecian Cosmogony, differing widely from the later mythology, Eros is the third person in the primeval trinity: Chaos, Gaea,Eros: answering to the Kabalistic En-Soph (for Chaos is SPACE, [[chaino]], \"void\") the Boundless ALL, Shekinah and the Ancient ofDays, or the Holy Ghost; so Fohat is one thing in the yet unmanifested Universe and another in the phenomenal and Cosmic World. Inthe latter, he is that Occult, electric, vital power, which, under the Will of the Creative Logos, unites and brings together all forms,giving them the first impulse which becomes in time law. But in the unmanifested Universe, Fohat is no more this, than Eros is thelater brilliant winged Cupid, or LOVE. Fohat has naught to do with Kosmos yet, since Kosmos is not born, and the gods still sleep inthe bosom of \"Father-Mother.\" He is an abstract philosophical idea. He produces nothing yet by himself; he is simply that potentialcreative power in virtue of whose action the NOUMENON of all future phenomena divides, so to speak, but to reunite in a mysticsupersensuous act, and emit the creative ray. When the \"Divine Son\" breaks forth, then Fohat becomes the propelling force, the activePower which causes the ONE to become TWO and THREE -- on the Cosmic plane of manifestation. The triple One differentiates intothe many, and then Fohat is transformed into that force which brings together the elemental atoms and makes them aggregate andcombine. We find an echo of this primeval teaching------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 110 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.in early Greek mythology. Erebos and Nux are born out of Chaos, and, under the action of Eros, give birth in their turn to Ether andHemera, the light of the superior and the light of the inferior or terrestrial regions. Darkness generates light. See in the PuranasBrahma's \"Will\" or desire to create; and in the Phoenician Cosmogony of Sanchoniathon the doctrine that Desire, [[pothos]], is theprinciple of creation.Fohat is closely related to the \"ONE LIFE.\" From the Unknown One, the Infinite TOTALITY, the manifested ONE, or the periodical,Manvantaric Deity, emanates; and this is the Universal Mind, which, separated from its Fountain-Source, is the Demiurgos or thecreative Logos of the Western Kabalists, and the four-faced Brahma of the Hindu religion. In its totality, viewed from the standpoint ofmanifested Divine Thought in the esoteric doctrine, it represents the Hosts of the higher creative Dhyan Chohans. Simultaneously withthe evolution of the Universal Mind, the concealed Wisdom of Adi-Buddha -- the One Supreme and eternal -- manifests itself asAvalokiteshwara (or manifested Iswara), which is the Osiris of the Egyptians, the Ahura-Mazda of the Zoroastrians, the Heavenly Manof the Hermetic philosopher, the Logos of the Platonists, and the Atman of the Vedantins.* By the action of the manifested Wisdom,or Mahat, represented by these innumerable centres of spiritual Energy in the Kosmos, the reflection of the Universal Mind, which isCosmic Ideation and the intellectual Force accompanying such ideation, becomes objectively the Fohat of the Buddhist esotericphilosopher. Fohat, running along the seven principles of AKASA, acts upon manifested substance or the One Element, as declared"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"above, and by differentiating it into various centres of Energy, sets in motion the law of Cosmic Evolution, which, in obedience to theIdeation of the Universal Mind, brings into existence all the various states of being in the manifested Solar System.The Solar System, brought into existence by these agencies, consists of Seven Principles, like everything else within these centres.Such is the teaching of the trans-Himalayan Esotericism. Every philosophy, however, has its own way of dividing these principles.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Mr. Subba Row seems to identify him with, and to call him, the LOGOS. (See his four lectures on the \"Bhagavadgita\" in theTheosophist.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 111 THE PROTEAN SPIRIT-SUBSTANCE.Fohat, then, is the personified electric vital power, the transcendental binding Unity of all Cosmic Energies, on the unseen as on themanifested planes, the action of which resembles -- on an immense scale -- that of a living Force created by WILL, in thosephenomena where the seemingly subjective acts on the seemingly objective and propels it to action. Fohat is not only the livingSymbol and Container of that Force, but is looked upon by the Occultists as an Entity -- the forces he acts upon being cosmic, humanand terrestrial, and exercising their influence on all those planes respectively. On the earthly plane his influence is felt in themagnetic and active force generated by the strong desire of the magnetizer. On the Cosmic, it is present in the constructive power thatcarries out, in the formation of things -- from the planetary system down to the glow-worm and simple daisy -- the plan in the mind ofnature, or in the Divine Thought, with regard to the development and growth of that special thing. He is, metaphysically, theobjectivised thought of the gods; the \"Word made flesh,\" on a lower scale, and the messenger of Cosmic and human ideations: theactive force in Universal Life. In his secondary aspect, Fohat is the Solar Energy, the electric vital fluid,* and the preserving fourth[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In 1882 the President of the Theosophical Society, Col. Olcott, was taken to task for asserting in one of his lectures that Electricity ismatter. Such, nevertheless, is the teaching of the Occult Doctrine. \"Force,\" \"Energy,\" may be a better name for it, so long as EuropeanScience knows so little about its true nature; yet matter it is, as much as Ether is matter, since it is as atomic, though several removesfrom the latter. It seems ridiculous to argue that because a thing is imponderable to Science, therefore it cannot be called matter.Electricity is \"immaterial\" in the sense that its molecules are not subject to perception and experiment; yet it may be -- and Occultismsays it is -- atomic; therefore it is matter. But even supposing it were unscientific to speak of it in such terms, once Electricity is calledin Science a source of Energy, Energy simply, and a Force -- where is that Force or that Energy which can be thought of withoutthinking of matter? Maxwell, a mathematician and one of the greatest authorities upon Electricity and its phenomena, said, yearsago, that Electricity was matter, not motion merely. \"If we accept the hypothesis that the elementary substances are composed ofatoms we cannot avoid concluding that electricity also, positive as well as negative, is divided into definite elementary portions,which behave like atoms of electricity.\" (Helmholtz, Faraday Lecture, 1881). We will go further than that, and assert that Electricity isnot only Substance but that it is an emanation from an Entity, which is neither God nor Devil, but one of the numberless Entities thatrule and guide our world according to the eternal Law of KARMA.

In India, Fohat is connected with Vishnu and Surya in the earlycharacter of the (first) God; for Vishnu is not a high god in the Rig Veda. The name Vishnu is from the root vish, \"to pervade,\" andFohat is called the \"Pervader\" and the Manufacturer, because he shapes the atoms from crude material.* In the sacred texts of the RigVeda, Vishnu, also, is \"a manifestation of the Solar Energy,\" and he is described as striding through the Seven regions of the Universein three steps, the Vedic God having little in common with the Vishnu of later times. Therefore the two are identical in this particularfeature, and one is the copy of the other.The \"three and seven\" strides refer to the Seven spheres inhabited by man, of the esoteric Doctrine, as well as to the Seven regions ofthe Earth. Notwithstanding the frequent objections made by would-be Orientalists, the Seven Worlds or spheres of our planetary chainare distinctly referred to in the exoteric Hindu scriptures. But how strangely all these numbers are connected with like numbers in otherCosmogonies and with their symbols, can be seen from comparisons and parallelisms made by students of old religions. The \"threestrides of Vishnu\" through the \"seven regions of the Universe,\" of the Rig Veda, have been variously explained by commentators asmeaning \"fire, lightning and the Sun\" cosmically; and as having been taken in the Earth, the atmosphere, and the sky; also as the\"three steps\" of the dwarf (Vishnu's incarnation), though more philosophically -- and in the astronomical sense, very correctly -- theyare explained by Aurnavabha as being the various positions of the sun, rising, noon, and setting. Esoteric philosophy alone explains itclearly, and the Zohar laid it down very philosophically and comprehensively. It is said and plainly demonstrated therein that in thebeginning the Elohim (Elhim) were called Echod, \"one,\" or the \"Deity is one in many,\" a very simple idea in a pantheistic conception(in its philosophical sense, of course). Then came the change, \"Jehovah is Elohim,\" thus unifying the multiplicity and taking the firststep towards Monotheism. Now to the query, \"How is Jehovah Elohim?\" the answer is, \"By three Steps\" from below.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is well known that sand, when placed on a metal plate in vibration assumes a series of regular curved figures of variousdescriptions.

Stepping out of the Circle of Infinity, that no mancomprehendeth, Ain-Soph (the Kabalistic synonym for Parabrahm, for the Zeroana Akerne, of the Mazdeans, or for any other\"UNKNOWABLE\") becomes \"One\" -- the ECHOD, the EKA, the AHU -- then he (or it) is transformed by evolution into the One in many,the Dhyani-Buddhas or the Elohim, or again the Amshaspends, his third Step being taken into generation of the flesh, or \"Man.\" Andfrom man, or Jah-Hova, \"male female,\" the inner divine entity becomes, on the metaphysical plane, once more the Elohim.The Kabalistic idea is identical with the Esotericism of the Archaic period. This esotericism is the common property of all, andbelongs neither to the Aryan 5th Race, nor to any of its numerous Sub-races. It cannot be claimed by the Turanians, so-called, theEgyptians, Chinese, Chaldeans, nor any of the Seven divisions of the Fifth Root Race, but really belongs to the Third and Fourth RootRaces, whose descendants we find in the Seed of the Fifth, the earliest Aryans. The Circle was with every nation the symbol of theUnknown -- \"Boundless Space,\" the abstract garb of an ever present abstraction -- the Incognisable Deity. It represents limitless Timein Eternity. The Zeroana Akerne is also the \"Boundless Circle of the Unknown Time,\" from which Circle issues the radiant light -- theUniversal SUN, or Ormazd** -- and the latter[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The numbers 3, 5, and 7 are prominent in speculative masonry, as shown in \"Isis.\" A mason writes:-- \"There are the 3, 5, and 7 stepsto show a circular walk.

For the circle is Sar, and Saros, or cycle, and was the Babylonian godwhose circular horizon was the visible symbol of the invisible, while the sun was the ONE Circle from which proceeded the Cosmicorbs, and of which he was considered the leader. Zero-ana, is the Chakra or circle of Vishnu, the mysterious emblem which is,according to the definition of a mystic, \"a curve of such a nature that as to any, the least possible part thereof, if the curve beprotracted either way it will proceed and finally re-enter upon itself, and form one and the same curve -- or that which we call thecircle.\" No better definition could thus be given of the natural symbol and the evident nature of Deity, which having its circumferenceeverywhere (the boundless) has, therefore, its central point also everywhere; in other words, is in every point of the Universe. Theinvisible Deity is thus also the Dhyan Chohans, or the Rishis, the primitive seven, and the nine, without, and ten, including, theirsynthetical unit; from which IT steps into Man. Returning to the Commentary (4) of Stanza IV. the reader will understand why, whilethe trans-Himalayan Chackra has inscribed within it [[diagram]] | [[diagram]] | [[diagram]] (triangle, first line, cube second line, and apentacle with a dot in the centre thus: [[diagram]], and some other variations), the Kabalistic circle of the Elohim reveals, when theletters of the word [[hebrew]] (Alhim or Elohim) are numerically read, the famous numerals 13514, or by anagram 31415 -- theastronomical (pi) number, or the hidden meaning of Dhyani-Buddhas, of the Gebers, the Geborim, the Kabeiri, and the Elohim, allsignifying \"great men,\" \"Titans,\" \"Heavenly Men,\" and, on earth, \"the giants.\"The Seven was a Sacred Number with every nation; but none applied it to more physiologically materialistic uses than the Hebrews.With these it was pre-eminently the generative number and 9 the male causative one, forming as shown by the Kabalists the [[hebrewwith numbers above]] or otz -- \"the Tree of the Garden of Eden,\"* the \"double hermaphrodite rod\" of the fourth race.

The Hindu Glyph shows by its insufficiency inthe large admixture of adventitious sides the same borrowed plumage that the Greeks (the lying Greeks) had, and that Masonry has:which in the rough monosyllabic (and apparent) poverty of the Hebrew, shows the latter to have come down from a far more remoteantiquity than any of these, and to have been the source (!?), or nearer the old original source than any of them.\" This is entirelyerroneous. Our learned brother and correspondent judges apparently the Hindu religious systems by their Shastras and Puranas,probably the latter, and in their modern translation moreover, which is disfigured out of all recognition, by the Orientalists. It is to theirphilosophical systems that one has to turn, to their esoteric teaching, if he would make a point of comparison. No doubt thesymbology of the Pentateuch and even of the New Testament, comes from the same source. But surely the Pyramid of Cheops, whosemeasurements are all found repeated by Professor Piazzi Smythe in Solomon's alleged and mythical temple, is not of a later datethan the Mosaic books? Hence, if there is any such great identity as claimed, it must be due to servile copying on the part of the Jews,not on that of the Egyptians. The Jewish glyphs -- and even their language, the Hebrew -- are not original. They are borrowed fromthe Egyptians, from whom Moses got his Wisdom; from the Coptic, the probable kinsman, if not parent, of the old Phoenician andfrom the Hyksos, their (alleged) ancestors, as Josephus shows in his \"Against Apion,\" I., 25. Aye; but who are the Hyksos shepherds?And who the Egyptians? History knows nothing of the question, and speculates and theorizes out of the depths of the respectiveconsciousnesses of her historians. (See Isis Unveiled, vol. II., p. 430-438.) \"Khamism, or old Coptic,\" says Bunsen, \"is from WesternAsia, and contains some germ of the Semitic, thus bearing witness to the primitive cognate unity of the Aryan and Semitic races\"; andhe places the great events in Egypt 9,000 years B.C. The fact is that in archaic Esotericism and Aryan thought we find a grandphilosophy, whereas in the Hebrew records we find only the most surprising ingenuity in inventing apotheoses for phallic worship andsexual theogony.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 116 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.nothing to do with the classification of the septenary chain and belong to the purely aethereal, invisible worlds.

Leucippus, and Democritus of Abdera -- the pupil of the Magi -- taught that this gyratorymovement of the atoms and spheres existed from eternity.* Hicetas, Heraclides, Ecphantus, Pythagoras, and all his pupils, taught therotation of the earth; and Aryabhata of India, Aristarchus, Seleucus, and Archimedes calculated its revolution as scientifically as theastronomers do now; while the theory of the Elemental Vortices was known to Anaxagoras, and maintained by him 500 years B.C., ornearly 2,000 before it was taken up by Galileo, Descartes, Swedenborg, and finally, with slight modifications, by Sir W.

It is heatand light and motion, and a correlation of physical and chemical forces in general. And this scientific definition is philosophicallysupplemented by the theological one in Webster's Dictionary, which explains fire as \"the instrument of punishment, or the punishmentof the impenitent in another state\" -- the \"state,\" by the bye, being supposed to be spiritual; but, alas! the presence of fire would seemto be a convincing proof of its material nature. Yet, speaking of the illusion of regarding phenomena as simple, because they arefamiliar, Professor Bain says (Logic. Part II.): \"Very familiar facts seem to stand in no need of explanation themselves and to be themeans of explaining whatever can be assimilated to them. Thus, the boiling and evaporation of a liquid is supposed to be a verysimple phenomenon requiring no explanation, and a satisfactory explanation of rarer phenomena. That water should dry up is, to theuninstructed mind, a thing wholly intelligible; whereas to the man acquainted with physical science the liquid state is anomalous andinexplicable.

There are two esoteric schools -- or rather one school, divided into two parts -- one for the inner Lanoos, the other forthe outer or semi-lay chelas beyond the Himalayas; the first teaching a septenary, the other a six-fold division of human principles.From a Cosmic point of view, Fohat taking \"five strides\" refers here to the five upper planes of Consciousness and Being, the sixth andthe seventh (counting downwards) being the astral and the terrestrial, or the two lower planes.(b) \"Four winged wheels at each corner . . . . . for the four holy ones and their armies (hosts)\" . . . . .

These BEINGS are also connected with Karma, as the latter needsphysical and material agents to carry out her decrees, such as the four kinds of winds, for instance, professedly admitted by Science tohave their respective evil and beneficent influences upon the health of Mankind and every living thing. There is occult philosophy inthat Roman Catholic doctrine which traces the various public calamities, such as epidemics of disease, and wars, and so on, to theinvisible \"Messengers\" from North and West. \"The glory of God comes from the way of the East\" says Ezekiel; while Jeremiah, Isaiah,and the Psalmist assure their readers that all the evil under the Sun comes from the North and the West -- which proposition, whenapplied to the Jewish nation, sounds like an undeniable prophecy for themselves. And this accounts also for St. Ambrose (On Amos,ch. iv.) declaring that it is precisely for that reason that \"we curse the North-Wind, and that during the ceremony of baptism we beginby turning towards the West (Sidereal), to renounce the better him who inhabits it; after which we turn to the East.\"Belief in the \"Four Maharajahs\" -- the Regents of the Four cardinal points -- was universal and is now that of Christians,* who callthem, after St. Augustine, \"Angelic Virtues,\" and \"Spirits\" when enumerated by themselves, and \"Devils\" when named by Pagans. Butwhere is the difference between the Pagans and the Christians in this cause? Following Plato, Aristotle explained that the term[[stoicheia]] was understood only as meaning the incorporeal principles placed at each of the four great divisions of our Cosmicalworld to supervise them. Thus, no more than the Christians did, do they adore and worship the Elements and the cardinal (imaginary)points, but the \"gods\" that ruled these respectively.

For the Kabalist and Occultist there is but one; and neither of them makes any difference between \"the Rectorsof Light\" and the Cosmocratores, or \"Rectores tenebrarum harum,\" whom the Roman Church imagines and discovers in a \"Rector ofLight\" as soon as he is called by another name than the one she addresses him by. It is not the \"Rector\" or \"Maharajah\" who punishesor rewards, with or without \"God's\" permission or order, but man himself -- his deeds or Karma, attracting individually and collectively(as in the case of whole nations sometimes), every kind of evil and calamity. We produce CAUSES, and these awaken thecorresponding powers in the sidereal world; which powers are magnetically and irresistibly attracted to -- and react upon -- those whoproduced these causes; whether such persons are practically the evil-doers, or simply Thinkers who brood mischief. Thought is matter,*we are taught by modern Science; and \"every particle of the existing matter must be a register of all that has happened,\" as in their\"Principles of Science\" Messrs. Jevons and Babbage tell the profane. Modern Science is drawn more every day into the maelstrom ofOccultism; unconsciously, no doubt, still very sensibly. The two main theories of science -- re the relations between Mind and Matter --are Monism and Materialism. These two cover the whole ground of negative psychology with the exception of the quasi-occult viewsof the pantheistic German schools.**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Not of course in the sense of the German Materialist Moleschott, who assures us that \"Thought is the movement of matter,\" astatement of almost unequalled absurdity. Mental states and bodily states are utterly contrasted as such. But that does not affect theposition that every thought, in addition to its physical accompaniment (brain-change), exhibits an objective -- though to ussupersensuously objective -- aspect on the astral plane. (See \"The Occult World,\" pp. 89, 90.)** The views of our present-day scientific thinkers as to the relations between mind and matter may be reduced to two hypotheses.These show that both views equally exclude the possibility of an independent Soul, distinct from the physical brain through which itfunctions.

The Jews had the same. In both, the curtain was drawn over five pillars (the Pentacle) symbolising our five senses andfive Root-races esoterically, while the four colours of the curtain represented the four cardinal points and the four terrestrial elements.The whole was an allegorical symbol. It is through the four high Rulers over the four points and Elements that our five senses maybecome cognisant of the hidden truths of Nature; and not at all, as Clemens would have it, that it is the elements per se that furnishedthe Pagans with divine Knowledge or the knowledge of God.* While the Egyptian emblem was spiritual, that of the Jews was purelymaterialistic, and, indeed, honoured only the blind Elements and the imaginary \"Points.\" For what was the meaning of the squaretabernacle raised by Moses in the wilderness, if it had not the same cosmical significance? \"Thou shalt make an hanging . . . of blue,purple, and scarlet\" and \"five pillars of shittim wood for the hanging . . . four brazen rings in the four corners thereof . . . boards of finewood for the four sides, North, South, West, and East . . . of the Tabernacle . . . with Cherubims of cunning work.\" (Exodus, ch. xxvi.,xxvii.) The Tabernacle and the square courtyard, Cherubim and all, were precisely the same as those in the Egyptian temples. Thesquare form of the Tabernacle meant just the same thing as it still means, to this day, in the exoteric worship of the Chinese andTibetans -- the four cardinal points signifying that which the four sides of the pyramids, obelisks, and other such square erectionsmean. Josephus takes care to explain the whole thing. He declares that the Tabernacle pillars are the same[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Materialism.\" This doctrine, which commands a very wide assent, counting among itsupholders such men as Lewis, Spencer, Ferrier, and others, while positing thought and mental phenomena generally as radicallycontrasted with matter, regards both as equal to the two sides, or aspects, of one and the same substance in some of its conditions.Thought as thought, they say, is utterly contrasted with material phenomena, but it must be also regarded as only \"the subjective sideof nervous motion\" whatever our learned men may mean by this.* Thus the sentence, \"Natura Elementorum obtinet revelationem Dei,\" (In Clemens's Stromata, R. IV., para. 6), is applicable to both orneither.

This is shown definitely by Layard, who finds the four cardinal points, and the four primitive elements,in the religion of every country, under the shape of square obelisks, the four sides of the pyramids, etc., etc. Of these elements andtheir points the four Maharajahs were the regents and the directors.If the student would know more of them, he has but to compare the Vision of Ezekiel (chap. i.) with what is known of ChineseBuddhism (even in its exoteric teachings); and examine the outward shape of these \"Great Kings.\" In the opinion of the Rev. JosephEdkins, they are \"the Devas who preside each over one of the four continents into which the Hindus divide the world.\"* Each leads anarmy of spiritual beings to protect mankind and Buddhism. With the exception of favouritism towards Buddhism, the four celestialbeings are precisely this. They are the protectors of mankind and also the Agents of Karma on Earth, whereas the Lipika areconcerned with Humanity's hereafter. At the same time they are the four living creatures \"who have the likeness of a man\" of Ezekiel'svisions, called by the translators of the Bible, \"Cherubim,\" \"Seraphim,\" etc.; and by the Occultists, \"the winged Globes,\" the \"FieryWheels,\" and in the Hindu Pantheon by a number of different names. All these Gandharvas, the \"Sweet Songsters,\" the Asuras,Kinnaras, and Nagas, are the allegorical descriptions of the \"four Maharajahs.\" The Seraphim are the fiery Serpents of Heaven whichwe find in a passage describing Mount Meru as: \"the exalted mass of glory, the venerable haunt of gods and heavenly choristers . . . .not to be reached by sinful men . . . . because guarded by Serpents.\" They are called the Avengers, and the \"Winged Wheels.\"Their mission and character being explained, let us see what the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Hindus happen to divide the world into seven continents, exoterically as esoterically; and their four cosmic Devas are eight,presiding over the eight points of the compass and not the Continents.

Very well; and vague as the information is, it shows that the Cherub placed at thegate of the garden of Eden after the \"Fall,\" suggested to the venerable Interpreters the idea of punishment connected with forbiddenScience or divine Knowledge -- one that generally leads to another \"Fall,\" that of the gods, or \"God,\" in man's estimation. But as thegood old Cruden knew nought of Karma, he may be forgiven. Yet the allegory is suggestive. From Meru, the abode of gods, to Eden,the distance is very small, and from the Hindu Serpents to the Ophite Cherubim, the third out of the seven of which was the Dragon,the separation is still smaller, for both watched the entrance to the realm of Secret Knowledge. But Ezekiel plainly describes the fourCosmic Angels: \"I looked, and behold, a whirlwind, a cloud and fire infolding it . . . also out of the midst thereof came the likeness offour living creatures . . . they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces and four wings . . . the face of a man, and theface of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle . . . \" (\"Man\" was here substituted for \"Dragon.\" Compare the \"OphiteSpirits.\"*) . . . \"Now as I beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the Earth with his four faces . . . as it were a wheel in themiddle of a wheel . . . for the support of the living creature was in the wheel . . . their appearance was like coals of fire . . .\" etc.(Ezekiel, ch. i.)There are three chief groups of Builders and as many of the Planetary Spirits and the Lipika, each group being again divided intoSeven sub-groups. It is impossible, even in such a large work as this, to enter into a minute examination of even the three principalgroups, as it would demand an extra volume. The \"Builders\" are the representatives of the first \"Mind-Born\" Entities, therefore of theprimeval Rishi-Prajapati: also of the Seven great Gods of Egypt, of which Osiris is the chief: of the Seven Amshaspends of theZoroastrians, with[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Angels recognised by the Roman Catholic Church who correspond to these \"Faces\" were with the Ophites:-- Dragon -- Raphael;Lion -- Michael; Bull, or ox -- Uriel; and Eagle -- Gabriel.

In the Hindu exoteric Pantheon they are the guardian deities who preside overthe eight points of the compass -- the four cardinal and the four intermediate points -- and are called Loka-Palas, \"Supporters orguardians of the World\" (in our visible Kosmos), of which Indra (East), Yama (South), Varuna (West), and Kuvera (North) are the chief;their elephants and their spouses pertaining of course to fancy and afterthought, though all of them have an occult significance.The Lipika (a description of whom is given in the Commentary on Stanza IV. No. 6) are the Spirits of the Universe, whereas theBuilders are only our own planetary deities. The former belong to the most occult portion of Cosmogenesis, which cannot be givenhere. Whether the Adepts (even the highest) know this angelic order in the completeness of its triple degrees, or only the lower oneconnected with the records of our world, is something which the writer is unprepared to say, and she would incline rather to the lattersupposition. Of its highest grade one thing only is taught: the Lipika are connected with Karma -- being its direct Recorders.**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Jews, save the Kabalists, having no names for East, West, South, and North, expressed the idea by words signifying before,behind, right and left, and very often confounded the terms exoterically, thus making the blinds in the Bible more confused anddifficult to interpret. Add to this the fact that out of the forty-seven translators of King James I. of England's Bible \"only threeunderstood Hebrew, and of these two died before the Psalms were translated\" (Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia), and one may easilyunderstand what reliance can be placed on the English version of the Bible. In this work the Douay Roman Catholic version isgenerally followed.** The Symbol for Sacred and Secret Knowledge was universally in antiquity, a Tree, by which a Scripture or a Record was alsomeant.

From the group of Four and Seven emanates the\"mind-born\" group of Ten, of Twelve, of Twenty-one, etc., all these divided again into sub-groups of septenaries, novenaries,duodecimals, and so on, until the mind is lost in this endless enumeration of celestial hosts and Beings, each having its distinct task inthe ruling of the visible Kosmos during its existence.(a) The esoteric meaning of the first sentence of the Sloka is, that those who have been called Lipikas, the Recorders of the Karmicledger, make an impassible barrier between the personal EGO and the impersonal SELF, the Noumenon and Parent-Source of theformer. Hence the allegory. They circumscribe the manifested world of matter within the RING \"Pass-Not.\" This world is the symbol(objective) of the ONE divided into the many, on the planes of Illusion, of Adi (the \"First\") or of Eka (the \"One\"); and this One is thecollective aggregate, or totality, of the principal Creators or Architects of this visible universe. In Hebrew Occultism their name is bothAchath, feminine, \"One,\" and Achod, \"One\" again, but masculine. The monotheists have taken (and are still taking) advantage of theprofound esotericism of the Kabala to apply the name by which the One Supreme Essence is known to ITS manifestation, theSephiroth-Elohim, and call it Jehovah. But this is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] \"writers\" or scribes; the \"Dragons,\" symbols of wisdom, who guard the Trees of Knowledge;the \"golden\" apple Tree of the Hesperides; the \"Luxuriant Trees\" and vegetation of Mount Meru guarded by a Serpent.

The former can neither emanate nor be divided, as it is eternal, absolute, and immutable. The Second, being, so tospeak, the reflection of the first One (for it is the Logos, or Eswara, in the Universe of Illusion), can do all this.** It emanates from itself -- as the upper Sephirothal Triad emanates the lower seven Sephiroth -- the seven Rays or Dhyan Chohans; in other words, theHomogeneous becomes the Heterogeneous, the \"Protyle\" differentiates into the Elements.

Now Parabrahmam, is the one essence from which starts intoexistence a centre of energy, which I shall for the present call the Logos. . . . It is called the Verbum . . . by the Christians, and it is thedivine Christos who is eternal in the bosom of his father. It is called Avalokiteshwara by the Buddhists. . . . In almost every doctrine,they have formulated the existence of a centre of spiritual energy which is unborn and eternal, and which exists in the bosom ofParabrahmam at the time of Pralaya, and starts as a centre of conscious energy at the time of Cosmic activity. . . .\" For, as the lecturerpremised by saying, Parabraham is not this or that, it is not even consciousness, as it cannot be related to matter or anythingconditioned. It is not Ego nor is it Non-ego, not even Atma, but verily the one source of all manifestations and modes of existence.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 131 THE SIDEREAL BOOK OF LIFE.nising fully the non-separateness of the Ego within his personality -- erroneously regarded as his own -- from the UNIVERSAL EGO(Anima Supra-Mundi), merges thereby into the One Essence to become not only one \"with us\" (the manifested universal lives whichare \"ONE\" LIFE), but that very life itself.Astronomically, the \"Ring PASS-NOT\" that the Lipika trace around the Triangle, the First One, the Cube, the Second One, and thePentacle to circumscribe these figures, is thus shown to contain the symbol of 31415 again, or the coefficient constantly used inmathematical tables (the value of, pi), the geometrical figures standing here for numerical figures. According to the generalphilosophical teachings, this ring is beyond the region of what are called nebulae in astronomy. But this is as erroneous a conceptionas that of the topography and the descriptions, given in Puranic and other exoteric Scriptures, about the 1008 worlds of the Devalokaworlds and firmaments. There are worlds, of course, in the esoteric as well as in the profane scientific teachings, at such incalculabledistances that the light of the nearest of them which has just reached our modern Chaldees, had left its luminary long before the dayon which the words \"Let there be Light\" were pronounced; but these are no worlds on the Devaloka plane, but in our Kosmos.The chemist goes to the laya or zero point of the plane of matter with which he deals, and then stops short. The physicist or theastronomer counts by billions of miles beyond the nebulae, and then they also stop short; the semi-initiated Occultist will representthis laya-point to himself as existing on some plane which, if not physical, is still conceivable to the human intellect. But the fullInitiate knows that the ring \"Pass-Not\" is neither a locality nor can it be measured by distance, but that it exists in the absoluteness ofinfinity. In this \"Infinity\" of the full Initiate there is neither height, breadth nor thickness, but all is fathomless profundity, reaching downfrom the physical to the \"para-para-metaphysical.\" In using the word \"down,\" essential depth -- \"nowhere and everywhere\" -- is meant,not depth of physical matter.If one searches carefully through the exoteric and grossly anthropomorphic allegories of popular religions, even in these the doctrineembodied in the circle of \"Pass-Not\" thus guarded by the Lipika, may be dimly perceived. Thus one finds it even in the teachings of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 132 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Vedantin sect of the Visishtadwaita, the most tenaciously anthropomorphic in all India. For we read of the released soul that:--After reaching Moksha (a state of bliss meaning \"release from Bandha\" or bondage), bliss is enjoyed by it in a place calledPARAMAPADHA, which place is not material, but made of Suddasatwa (the essence, of which the body of Iswara -- \"the Lord\" -- isformed). There, Muktas or Jivatmas (Monads) who have attained Moksha, are never again subject to the qualities of either matter orKarma. \"But if they choose, for the sake of doing good to the world, they may incarnate on Earth.\"* The way to Paramapadha, or theimmaterial worlds, from this world, is called Devayana. When a person has attained Moksha and the body dies:--\"The Jiva (Soul) goes with Sukshma Sarira** from the heart of the body, to the Brahmarandra in the crown of the head, traversingSushumna, a nerve connecting the heart with the Brahmarandra. The Jiva breaks through the Brahmarandra and goes to the regionof the Sun (Suryamandala) through the solar Rays. Then it goes, through a dark spot in the Sun, to Paramapadha. The Jiva isdirected on its way by the Supreme Wisdom acquired by Yoga.*** The Jiva thus proceeds to Paramapadha by the aid of Athivahikas(bearers in transit), known by the names of Archi-Ahas . . .

The ant mayalso, for all we know, see the avenging finger of a personal God in the hand of the urchin who, in one moment, under the impulse ofmischief, destroys its anthill, the labour of many weeks -- long years in the chronology of insects. The ant, feeling it acutely, andattributing the undeserved calamity to a combination of Providence and sin, may also, like man, see in it the result of the sin of its firstparent. Who knows and who can affirm or deny? The refusal to admit in the whole Solar system of any other reasonable andintellectual beings on the human plane, than ourselves, is the greatest conceit of our age. All that science has a right to affirm, is thatthere are no invisible Intelligences living under the same conditions as we do. It cannot deny point-blank the possibility of there beingworlds within worlds, under totally different conditions to those that constitute the nature of our world; nor can it deny that there maybe a certain limited communication* between some of those worlds and our own. To the highest, we are taught, belong the sevenorders of the purely divine Spirits; to the six lower ones belong hierarchies that can occasionally be seen and heard by men, and whodo communicate with their progeny of the Earth; which progeny is indissolubly linked with them, each principle in man having itsdirect source in the nature of those great Beings, who furnish us with the respective invisible elements in us. Physical Science iswelcome to speculate upon the physiological mechanism of living beings, and to continue her fruitless efforts in trying to resolve ourfeelings, our sensations, mental and spiritual, into functions of their inorganic vehicles. Nevertheless, all that will ever beaccomplished in this direction has already been done, and Science will go no farther.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The greatest philosopher of European birth, Imanuel Kant, assures us that such a communication is in no way improbable. \"I confessI am much disposed to assert the existence of Immaterial natures in the world, and to place my own soul in the class of these beings.It will hereafter, I know not where, or when, yet be proved that the human soul stands even in this life in indissoluble connection withall immaterial natures in the spirit-world, that it reciprocally acts upon these and receives impressions from them.\" (Traume einesGeistersehers, quoted by C.

Its significance is not soeasily revealed to a public, unacquainted with the mystic tenets of Occultism, or rather of Esoteric Wisdom or \"Budhism.\" It is anexpression peculiar to the latter, and as hazy for the profane as that of the Egyptians who called the same the \"Day of COME-TO-US,\"** which[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* E.g., all that modern physiological research in connection with psychological problems has, and owing to the nature of things, couldhave shown, is, that every thought, sensation, and emotion is attended with a re-marshalling of the molecules of certain nerves. Theinference drawn by scientists of the type of Buchner, Vogt, and others, that thought is molecular motion, necessitates a completeabstraction being made of the fact of our subjective consciousness.** See \"Le Livre des Morts,\" by Paul Pierret; \"Le Jour de 'Viens a nous' . . . c'est le jour ou Osiris a dit au Soleil: Viens! Je le voisrencontrant le Soleil dans l'Amenti.\" (Chap. xvii., p. 61.) The Sun here stands for the Logos (or Christos, or Horus) as central Essencesynthetically, and as a diffused essence of radiated Entities, different in substance, but not in essence. As expressed by theBhagavadgita lecturer, \"it must not be supposed that the Logos is but a single centre of energy manifested from Parabrahmam; thereare innumerable other centres . . . and their number is almost infinite in the bosom of Parabrahmam.\" Hence the expressions, \"TheDay of Come to us\" and \"The Day of Be with us,\" etc. Just as the square is the Symbol of the Four sacred Forces or Powers -- Tetraktis -- so the Circle shows the boundary within the Infinity that no man can cross, even in spirit, nor Deva nor Dhyan Chohan.

As in the exoteric interpretation of the Egyptianrites the soul of every defunct person -- from the Hierophant down to the sacred bull Apis -- became an Osiris, was Osirified, though theSecret Doctrine had always taught, that the real Osirification was the lot of every Monad only after 3,000 cycles of Existences; so inthe present case. The \"Monad,\" born of the nature and the very Essence of the \"Seven\" (its highest principle becoming immediatelyenshrined in the Seventh Cosmic Element), has to perform its septenary gyration throughout the Cycle of Being and forms, from thehighest to the lowest; and then again from man to God.

Thus in the Esotericism of the Vedantins,Daiviprakriti, the Light manifested through Eswara, the Logos,** is at one and the same time the Mother and also the Daughter of theLogos or Verbum of Parabrahmam; while in that of the trans-Himalayan teachings it is -- in the hierarchy of allegorical andmetaphysical theogony -- \"the MOTHER\" or abstract, ideal matter, Mulaprakriti, the Root of Nature; -- from the metaphysicalstandpoint, a correlation of Adi-Bhuta, manifested in the Logos, Avalokiteshwara; -- and from the purely occult and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This stanza is translated from the Chinese text, and the names, as the equivalents of the original terms, are preserved.

No exoteric religious system has ever adopted a female Creator, and thus woman was regarded andtreated, from the first dawn of popular religions, as inferior to man. It is only in China and Egypt that Kwan-Yin and Isis were placedon a par with the male gods. Esotericism ignores both sexes. Its highest Deity is sexless as it is formless, neither Father nor Mother; andits first manifested beings, celestial and terrestrial alike, become only gradually androgynous and finally separate into distinct sexes.** The \"Theosophist\" of February, 1887, p. 305, first lecture on the Bhagavadgita.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 137 THE MYSTERY OF THE FEMALE LOGOS.Cosmical, Fohat,* the \"Son of the Son,\" the androgynous energy resulting from this \"Light of the Logos,\" and which manifests in theplane of the objective Universe as the hidden, as much as the revealed, Electricity -- which is LIFE.(b) Kwan-Yin-Tien means the \"melodious heaven of Sound,\" the abode of Kwan-Yin, or the \"Divine Voice\" literally. This \"Voice\" is asynonym of the Verbum or the Word: \"Speech,\" as the expression of thought. Thus may be traced the connection with, and even theorigin of the Hebrew Bath-Kol, the \"daughter of the Divine Voice,\" or Verbum, or the male and female Logos, the \"Heavenly Man\" orAdam Kadmon, who is at the same time Sephira. The latter was surely anticipated by the Hindu Vach, the goddess of Speech, or ofthe Word. For Vach -- the daughter and the female portion, as is stated, of Brahma, one \"generated by the gods\" -- is, in company withKwan-Yin, with Isis (also the daughter, wife and sister of Osiris) and other goddesses, the female Logos, so to speak, the goddess of theactive forces in Nature, the Word, Voice or Sound, and Speech.

It has often been asked what was the exactdefinition of Fohat and his powers and functions, as he seems to exercise those of a Personal God as understood in the popularreligions. The answer has just been given in the comment on Stanza V. As well said in the Bhagavadgita Lectures, \"The wholeKosmos must necessarily exist in the One Source of energy from which this light (Fohat) emanates.\" Whether we count the principlesin Kosmos and man as seven or only as four, the forces of, and in, physical Nature are Seven; and it is stated by the same authoritythat \"Pragna, or the capacity of perception, exists in seven different aspects corresponding to the seven conditions of matter\" (Personaland impersonal God). For, \"just as a human being is composed of seven principles, differentiated matter in the Solar System exists inseven different conditions\" (ibid). So does Fohat.* He is One and Seven, and on the Cosmic plane is behind all such manifestationsas light, heat, sound, adhesion, etc., etc., and is the \"spirit\" of ELECTRICITY, which is the LIFE of the Universe. As an abstraction, wecall it the ONE LIFE; as an objective and evident Reality, we speak of a septenary scale of manifestation, which begins at the upperrung with the One Unknowable CAUSALITY, and ends as Omnipresent Mind and Life immanent in every atom of Matter. Thus, whilescience speaks of its evolution through brute matter, blind force, and senseless motion, the Occultists point to intelligent LAW andsentient LIFE, and add that Fohat is the guiding Spirit of all this. Yet he is no personal god at all, but the emanation of those otherPowers behind him whom the Christians call the \"Messengers\" of their God (who is in reality only the Elohim, or rather one of theSeven Creators called Elohim), and we, the \"Messenger of the primordial Sons of Life and Light.\"(b.)

LASTLY, SEVEN SMALL WHEELS REVOLVING;ONE GIVING BIRTH TO THE OTHER (b).(a.) Although these Stanzas refer to the whole Universe after a Mahapralaya (universal destruction), yet this sentence, as any studentof Occultism may see, refers also by analogy to the evolution and final formation of the primitive (though compound) Seven Elementson our Earth. Of these, four elements are now fully manifested, while the fifth -- Ether -- is only partially so, as we are hardly in thesecond half of the Fourth Round, and consequently the fifth Element will manifest fully only in the Fifth Round. The Worlds, includingour own, were of course, as germs, primarily evolved from the ONE Element in its second stage (\"Father-Mother,\" the differentiatedWorld's Soul, not what is termed the \"Over-Soul\" by Emerson), whether we call it, with modern Science, Cosmic dust and Fire Mist, orwith Occultism -- Akasa, Jivatma, divine Astral Light, or the \"Soul of the World.\" But this first stage of Evolution was in due course oftime followed by the next. No world, as no heavenly body, could be constructed on the objective plane, had not the Elements beensufficiently differentiated already from their primeval Ilus, resting in Laya. The latter term is a synonym of Nirvana. It is, in fact, theNirvanic dissociation of all substances, merged after a life-cycle into the latency of their primary conditions. It is the luminous butbodiless shadow of the matter that was, the realm of negativeness -- wherein lie latent during their period of rest the active Forces ofthe Universe. Now, speaking of Elements, it is made the standing reproach of the Ancients, that they \"supposed their Elements simpleand undecomposable.\"* Once more this is an unwarrantable state-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The shades of our pre-historical ancestors might return the compliment to modern physicists, now that new discoveries in chemistryhave led Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., to admit that Science is yet a thousand leagues from the knowledge of the compound nature of thesimplest molecule. From him we learn that such a thing as a really simple [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 141 WERE THE ANCIENTS IGNORANT OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES?ment; as, at any rate, their initiated philosophers can hardly come under such an imputation, since it is they who have inventedallegories and religious myths from the beginning. Had they been ignorant of the Heterogeneity of their Elements they would havehad no personifications of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and AEther; their Cosmic gods and goddesses would never have been blessed withsuch posterity, with so many sons and daughters, elements born from and within each respective Element. Alchemy and occultphenomena would have been a delusion and a snare, even in theory, had the Ancients been ignorant of the potentialities andcorrelative functions and attributes of every element that enters into the composition of Air, Water, Earth, and even Fire -- the latter aterra incognita to this day to modern Science, which is obliged to call it Motion, evolution of light and heat, state of ignition, --defining it by its outward aspects in short, and remaining ignorant of its nature. But that which[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] molecule entirely homogeneous is terra incognita in chemistry. \"Where are we to draw theline?\" he asks; \"is there no way out of this perplexity? Must we either make the elementary examinations so stiff that only 60 or 70candidates can pass, or must we open the examination doors so wide that the number of admissions is limited only by the number ofapplicants?\" And then the learned gentleman gives striking instances. He says: \"Take the case of yttrium. It has its definite atomicweight, it behaved in every respect as a simple body, an element, to which we might indeed add, but from which we could not takeaway. Yet this yttrium, this supposed homogeneous whole, on being submitted to a certain method of fractionation, is resolved intoportions not absolutely identical among themselves, and exhibiting a gradation of properties. Or take the case of didymium. Here wasa body betraying all the recognised characters of an element. It had been separated with much difficulty from other bodies whichapproximated closely to it in their properties, and during this crucial process it had undergone very severe treatment and very closescrutiny. But then came another chemist, who, treating this assumed homogeneous body by a peculiar process of fractionation,resolved it into the two bodies praseodymium and neodymium, between which certain distinctions are perceptible. Further, we evennow have no certainty that neodymium and praseodymium are simple bodies. On the contrary, they likewise exhibit symptoms ofsplitting up. Now, if one supposed element on proper treatment is thus found to comprise dissimilar molecules, we are surelywarranted in asking whether similar results might not be obtained in other elements, perhaps in all elements, if treated in the rightway. We may even ask where the process of sorting-out is to stop -- a process which of course pre-supposes variations between theindividual molecules of each species. And in these successive separations we naturally find bodies approaching more and moreclosely to each other.\" (Presidential address before the Royal Society of Chemists, March, 1888.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 142 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"modern Science seems to fail to perceive is that, differentiated as may have been those simple chemical atoms -- which archaicphilosophy called \"the creators of their respective Parents,\" fathers, brothers, husbands of their mothers, and those mothers thedaughters of their own sons, like Aditi and Daksha, for example -- differentiated as these elements were in the beginning, still, theywere not the compound bodies known to science, as they are now. Neither Water, Air, Earth (synonym for solids generally) existed intheir present form, representing the three states of matter alone recognised by Science; for all these are the productions alreadyrecombined by the atmospheres of globes completely formed -- even to fire -- so that in the first periods of the earth's formation theywere something quite sui generis. Now that the conditions and laws ruling our solar system are fully developed; and that theatmosphere of our earth, as of every other globe, has become, so to say, a crucible of its own, Occult Science teaches that there is aperpetual exchange taking place in space of molecules, or of atoms rather, correlating, and thus changing their combiningequivalents on every planet. Some men of Science, and those among the greatest physicists and chemists, begin to suspect this fact,which has been known for ages to the Occultists. The spectroscope only shows the probable similarity (on external evidence) ofterrestrial and sidereal substance; it is unable to go any farther, or to show whether atoms gravitate towards one another in the sameway and under the same conditions as they are supposed to do on our planet, physically and chemically. The scale of temperature,from the highest degree to the lowest that can be conceived of, may be imagined to be one and the same in and for the wholeUniverse; nevertheless, its properties, other than those of dissociation and reassociation, differ on every planet; and thus atoms enterinto new forms of existence, undreamt of, and incognizable to, physical Science. As already expressed in \"Five Years of Theosophy,\"the essence of Cometary matter, for instance, \"is totally different from any of the chemical or physical characteristics with which thegreatest chemists and physicists of the earth are acquainted\" (p. 242).

Once caught by the latter, the atom is lost; its pristine purity is gone for ever, unless Fate dissociates it by leading it to \"acurrent of EFFLUX\" (an occult term meaning quite a different process from that which the ordinary term implies); when it may becarried once more to the borderland where it had perished, and taking its flight, not into Space above but into Space within, it will bebrought under a state of differential equilibrium and happily re-absorbed.

Therefore there must be many Fohats, whom we consider as conscious and intelligent Forces. This, no doubt, to the disgust ofscientific minds.

It is aneverlasting work of perfection with every new appearance, but the Substance-Matter and Forces are all one and the same. But thisLAW acts on every planet through minor and varying laws. The \"imperishable Laya Centres\" have a great importance, and theirmeaning must be fully understood if we would have a clear conception of the Archaic Cosmogony, whose theories have now passedinto Occultism. At present, one thing may be stated. The worlds are built neither upon, nor over, nor in the Laya centres, the zero-point being a condition, not any mathematical point.(b) Bear in mind that Fohat, the constructive Force of Cosmic Electricity, is said, metaphorically, to have sprung like Rudra fromBrahma \"from the brain of the Father and the bosom of the Mother,\" and then to have metamorphosed himself into a male and afemale, i.e., polarity, into positive and negative electricity. He has seven sons who are his brothers; and Fohat is forced to be borntime after time whenever any two of his son-brothers indulge in too close contact -- whether an embrace or a fight. To avoid this, hebinds together and unites those of unlike nature and separates those of similar temperaments. This, of course, relates, as any one cansee, to electricity generated by friction and to the law involving attraction between two objects of unlike, and repulsion between thoseof like polarity. The Seven \"Sons-brothers,\" however, represent and personify the seven forms of Cosmic magnetism called in practicalOccultism the \"Seven Radicals,\" whose co-operative and active progeny are, among other energies, Electricity, Magnetism, Sound,Light, Heat, Cohesion, etc. Occult Science defines all these as Super-sensuous effects in their hidden behaviour, and as objectivephenomena in the world of senses; the former requiring abnormal faculties to perceive them -- the latter, our ordinary physical senses.They all pertain to, and are the emanations of, still more supersensuous spiritual qualities, not personated by, but belonging to, realand conscious CAUSES. To attempt a description of such ENTITIES would be worse than useless. The reader must bear in mind that,according to our teaching which regards this phenomenal Universe as a great Illusion, the nearer a body is to the UNKNOWNSUBSTANCE, the more it approaches reality, as being removed the farther------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 146 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.from this world of Maya. Therefore, though the molecular constitution of their bodies is not deducible from their manifestations on thisplane of consciousness, they nevertheless (from the standpoint of the adept Occultist) possess a distinctive objective if not materialstructure, in the relatively noumenal -- as opposed to the phenomenal -- Universe. Men of science may term them Force or Forcesgenerated by matter, or \"modes of its motion,\" if they will; Occultism sees in the effects \"Elemental\" (forces), and, in the direct causesproducing them, intelligent DIVINE Workmen. The intimate connection of those Elementals (guided by the unerring hand of theRulers) -- their correlation we might call it -- with the elements of pure Matter, results in our terrestrial phenomena, such as light, heat,magnetism, etc., etc. Of course we shall never agree with the American Substantialists* who call every Force and Energy -- whetherLight, Heat, Electricity or Cohesion -- an \"Entity\"; for this would be equivalent to calling the noise produced by the rolling of thewheels of a vehicle an Entity -- thus confusing and identifying that \"noise\" with the driver outside, and the guiding Master Intelligencewithin the vehicle. But we certainly give that name to the \"drivers\" and to these guiding Intelligences -- the ruling Dhyan Chohans, asshown. The \"Elementals,\" the Nature-Forces, are the acting, though invisible, or rather imperceptible, secondary Causes and inthemselves the effects of primary Causes behind the Veil of all terrestrial phenomena. Electricity, light, heat, etc., have been aptlytermed the \"Ghost or Shadow of Matter in Motion,\" i.e., supersensuous states of matter whose effects only we are able to cognize. Toexpand, then, the simile given above. The sensation of light is like the sound of the rolling wheels -- a purely phenomenal effect,having no existence outside the observer; the proximate exciting cause of the sensation is comparable to the driver -- a supersensuousstate of matter in motion, a Nature-Force or Elemental. But, behind even this, stand -- just as the owner of the carriage directs thedriver from within -- the higher and noumenal causes, the Intelligences from whose essence radiate these States of \"Mother,\"generating the countless milliards of Elementals or psychic Nature-Spirits, just as every drop of water generates its physical"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Scientific Arena,\" a monthly Journal devoted to current philosophical teaching and its bearing upon the religious thought ofthe Age.

(See \"Gods, Monads, and Atoms,\" in Part III.) It is Fohat who guides the transfer of the principles from oneplanet to the other, from one star to another -- child-star. When a planet dies, its informing principles are transferred to a laya orsleeping centre, with potential but latent energy in it, which is thus awakened into life and begins to form itself into a new siderealbody. (Vide infra, \"A Few Theosophical Misconceptions, etc.\")It is most remarkable that, while honestly confessing their entire ignorance of the true Nature of even terrestrial matter -- primordialsubstance being regarded more as a dream than as a sober reality -- the physicists should set themselves up as judges, nevertheless,of that matter, and claim to know what it is able and is not able to do, in various combinations. Scientists know it (matter) hardly skin-deep, and yet they will dogmatise. It is \"a mode of motion\" and nothing else. But the force that is inherent in a living person's breath,when blowing a speck of dust from the table, is also, and undeniably, \"a mode of motion\"; and it is as undeniably not a quality of thematter, or the particles of that speck, and it emanates from the living and thinking Entity that breathed, whether the impulseoriginated consciously or unconsciously. Indeed, to endow matter -- something of which nothing is known so far -- with an inherentquality called Force, of the nature of which still less is known, is to create a far more serious difficulty than that which lies in theacceptation of the intervention of our \"Nature-Spirits\" in every natural phenomenon.The Occultists, who do not say -- if they would express themselves correctly -- that matter, but only the substance or essence of matter,is indestructible and eternal, (i.e., the Root of all, Mulaprakriti): assert that all the so-called Forces of Nature, Electricity, Magnetism,Light, Heat, etc., etc., far from being modes of motion of material particles, are in esse, i.e., in their ultimate constitution, thedifferentiated aspects of that Universal Motion which is discussed and explained in the first pages of this volume (See Proem). WhenFohat is said to produce \"Seven Laya Centres,\" it means that for formative or creative purposes, the GREAT LAW (Theists may call itGod) stops, or rather modifies its perpetual motion on seven invisible points within the area of the manifested Universe. \"The greatBreath digs through Space seven holes into Laya to cause them to circumgyrate during Manvantara\" (Occult Catechism). We------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 148 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.have said that Laya is what Science may call the Zero-point or line; the realm of absolute negativeness, or the one real absoluteForce, the NOUMENON of the Seventh State of that which we ignorantly call and recognise as \"Force\"; or again the Noumenon ofUndifferentiated Cosmic Substance which is itself an unreachable and unknowable object to finite perception; the root and basis of allstates of objectivity and subjectivity too; the neutral axis, not one of the many aspects, but its centre. It may serve to elucidate themeaning if we attempt to imagine a neutral centre -- the dream of those who would discover perpetual motion. A \"neutral centre\" is,in one aspect, the limiting point of any given set of senses. Thus, imagine two consecutive planes of matter as already formed; eachof these corresponding to an appropriate set of perceptive organs. We are forced to admit that between these two planes of matter anincessant circulation takes place; and if we follow the atoms and molecules of (say) the lower in their transformation upwards, thesewill come to a point where they pass altogether beyond the range of the faculties we are using on the lower plane. In fact, to us thematter of the lower plane there vanishes from our perception into nothing -- or rather it passes on to the higher plane, and the state ofmatter corresponding to such a point of transition must certainly possess special and not readily discoverable properties. Such \"SevenNeutral Centres,\"* then, are produced by Fohat, who, when, as Milton has it --\"Fair foundations (are) laid whereon to build . . .\"quickens matter into activity and evolution.The Primordial Atom (anu) cannot be multiplied either in its pregenetic state, or its primogeneity; therefore it is called \"SUM TOTAL,\"figuratively, of course, as that \"SUM TOTAL\" is boundless. (See Addendum to this Book.) That which is the abyss of nothingness to thephysicist, who knows only the world of visible causes and effects, is the boundless Space of the Divine Plenum to the Occultist. Amongmany other objections to the doctrine of an endless evolution and re-involution (or re-absorption) of the Kosmos, a process which,according to the Brahminical and Esoteric Doctrine, is without a beginning or an end, the Occultist is told that it cannot be, since \"byall the admissions of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Such, we believe, is the name applied by Mr. Keely, of Philadelphia, the inventor of the famous \"Motor\" -- destined, as his admirershave hoped, to revolutionise the motor power of the world -- to what he again calls the \"Etheric Centres.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 149 THE MOON IS NOT DEAD, BUT ONLY SLEEPETH."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"modern scientific philosophy it is a necessity of Nature to run down.\" If the tendency of Nature \"to run down\" is to be considered soforcible an objection to Occult Cosmogony, \"How,\" we may ask, \"do your Positivists and Free-thinkers and Scientists account for thephalanx around us of active stellar systems?\" They had eternity to \"run down\" in; why, then, is not the Kosmos a huge inert mass?Even the moon is only hypothetically believed to be a dead planet, \"run down,\" and astronomy does not seem to be acquainted withmany such dead planets.* The query is unanswerable. But apart from this it must be noted that the idea of the amount of\"transformable energy\" in our little system coming to an end is based purely on the fallacious conception of a \"white-hot,incandescent Sun\" perpetually radiating away his heat without compensation into Space. To this we reply that nature runs down anddisappears from the objective plane, only to re-emerge after a time of rest out of the subjective and to reascend once more. OurKosmos and Nature will run down only to reappear on a more perfect plane after every PRALAYA. The matter of the Easternphilosophers is not the \"matter\" and Nature of the Western metaphysicians. For what is Matter? And above all, what is our scientificphilosophy but that which was so justly and so politely defined by Kant as \"the Science of the limits to our Knowledge\"?

These changeless and eternal molecules -- far thicker in space than the grainson the ocean shore -- may differ in their constitution along the line of their planes of existence, as the soul-substance differs from itsvehicle, the body. Each atom has seven planes of being or existence, we are taught; and each plane is governed by its specific lawsof evolution and absorption.

It is on this fact, mathematically demonstrated during the time of Laplace, that this great astronomer,calculating on the theory of probabilities, offered to bet three milliards to one that the next planet discovered would have in its systemthe same peculiarity of motion Eastward. The immutable laws of scientific mathematics got \"worsted by further experiments andobservations,\" it was said. This idea of Laplace's mistake prevails generally to this day; but some astronomers have finally succeededin demonstrating (?) that the mistake had been in accepting Laplace's assertion for a mistake; and steps to correct it without attractinggeneral attention to the bevue are now being taken. Many such unpleasant surprises are in store for hypotheses of even a purelyphysical character. What further disillusions, then, may there not be in questions of a transcendental, Occult Nature? At any rate,Occultism teaches that the so-called \"reverse rotation\" is a fact.* The Occultists, having most perfect faith in their own exact records, astronomical and mathematical, calculate the age of Humanity,and assert that the latter (as separate sexes) has existed in this Round just 18,618,727 years, as the Brahmanical teachings and evensome Hindu calendars declare.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 151 NATURE CAN NEVER CEASE.turned seven times,\" before one comes to understand it. Occult philosophy is the only science that can teach it. How, then, cananyone hang the truth or the untruth of the Occultist's proposition that \"the Kosmos is eternal in its unconditioned collectivity, andfinite but in its conditioned manifestations\" on this one-sided physical enunciation that \"it is a necessity of Nature to run down?\"---------------------"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"With these verses -- the 4th Sloka of Stanza VI. -- ends that portion of the Stanzas which relates to the Universal Cosmogony after thelast Mahapralaya or Universal destruction, which, when it comes, sweeps out of Space every differentiated thing, Gods as atoms, likeso many dry leaves. From this verse onwards, the Stanzas are concerned only with our Solar System in general, with the planetarychains therein, inferentially, and with the history of our globe (the 4th and its chain) especially. All the Stanzas and verses whichfollow in this Book I. refer only to the evolution of, and on, our Earth. With regard to the latter, a strange tenet -- strange from themodern scientific stand-point only, of course -- is held, which ought to be made known.But before entirely new and rather startling theories are presented to the reader, they must be prefaced by a few words of explanation.This is absolutely necessary, as these theories clash not only with modern science, but contradict, on certain points, earlier statementsmade by other Theosophists, who claim to base their explanations and renderings of these teachings on the same authority as we do.*This may give rise to the idea that there is a decided contradiction between the expounders of the same doctrine; whereas thedifference, in reality, arises from the incompleteness of the information given to earlier writers, who thus drew some erroneousconclusions and indulged in premature speculations, in their endeavour to present a complete system to the public. Thus the reader,who is already a student of Theosophy, must not be surprised to find in these pages the rectification of certain statements made invarious Theosophical works, and also the explanation of certain points which have remained obscure, because they were necessarilyleft incomplete. Many are the questions upon which even the author of \"Esoteric Buddhism\" (the best and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Esoteric Buddhism\" and \"Man.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 152 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.most accurate of all such works) has not touched. On the other hand, even he has introduced several mistaken notions which must nowbe presented in their true mystic light, as far as the present writer is capable of doing so.Let us then make a short break between the Slokas just explained and those which follow, for the Cosmic periods which separate themare of immense duration. This will afford us ample time to take a bird's eye view of some points pertaining to the Secret Doctrine,which have been presented to the public under a more or less uncertain and sometimes mistaken light.-------A FEW EARLY THEOSOPHICAL MISCONCEPTIONS CONCERNING PLANETS, ROUNDS, AND MAN.Among the eleven Stanzas omitted* there is one which gives a full description of the formation of the planetary chains one afteranother, after the first Cosmic and Atomic differentiation had commenced in the primitive Acosmism. It is idle to speak of \"laws arisingwhen Deity prepares to create\" for (a) laws or rather LAW is eternal and uncreated; and (b) that Deity is Law, and vice versa. Moreover,the one eternal LAW unfolds everything in the (to be) manifested Nature on a sevenfold principle; among the rest, the countlesscircular chains of worlds, composed of seven globes, graduated on the four lower planes of the world of formation (the three othersbelonging to the Archetypal Universe). Out of these seven only one, the lowest and the most material of those globes, is within ourplane or means of perception, the six others lying outside of it and being therefore invisible to the terrestrial eye. Every such chain ofworlds is the progeny and creation of another, lower, and dead chain -- its reincarnation, so to say. To make it clearer: we are told ofthe planets -- of which seven only were held as sacred, as being ruled by the highest regents or gods, and not at all because theancients knew nothing of the others** -- that each of these, whether known or unknown, is a septenary, as is the chain to which theEarth belongs (see \"Esoteric[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See the note which follows the Commentary on the preceding page, and also the summary of the Stanzas in the Proem, page 22.** Many more planets are enumerated in the Secret Books than in modern astronomical works.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 153 DESCENDING AND RE-ASCENDING STATES.Buddhism\"). For instance, all such planets as Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc., etc., or our Earth, are as visible to us as ourglobe, probably, is to the inhabitants of the other planets, if any, because they are all on the same plane; while the superior fellow-globes of these planets are on other planes quite outside that of our terrestrial senses. As their relative position is given further on, andalso in the diagram appended to the Comments on Verse 7 of Stanza VI., a few words of explanation is all that is needed at present.These invisible companions correspond curiously to that which we call \"the principles in Man.\" The seven are on three materialplanes and one spiritual plane, answering to the three Upadhis (material bases) and one spiritual vehicle (Vahan) of our sevenprinciples in the human division.

Ofcourse, as regards the human principles, the diagram does not place them quite in order, yet it shows the correspondence andanalogy to which attention is now drawn. As the reader will see, it is a case of descent into matter, the adjustment -- in both the mysticand the physical senses -- of the two, and their interblending for the great coming \"struggle of life\" that awaits both the entities.\"Entity\" may be thought a strange term to use in the case of a globe; but the ancient philosophers, who saw in the earth a huge\"animal,\" were wiser in their generation than our modern geologists are in theirs; and Pliny, who called the Earth our kind nurse andmother, the only element which is not inimical to man, spoke more truly than Watts, who fancied that he saw in her the footstool ofGod. For Earth is only the footstool of man in his ascension to higher regions; the vestibule --\". . . . . . . to glorious mansions,Through which a moving crowd for ever press.\"But this only shows how admirably the occult philosophy fits everything in Nature, and how much more logical are its tenets than thelifeless hypothetical speculations of physical science.Having learned thus much, the mystic will be better prepared to understand the occult teaching, though every formal student ofmodern science may, and probably will, regard it as preposterous nonsense. The student of occultism, however, holds that the theoryat present under discussion is far more philosophical and probable than any other. It is more logical, at any rate, than the theoryrecently advanced which made of the moon the projection of a portion of our Earth extruded when the latter was but a globe infusion, a molten plastic mass.*It is said that the planetary chains having their \"Days\" and their[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"* Says the author of \"Modern Science and Modern Thought,\" Mr. Samuel Laing: \"The astronomical conclusions are theories based ondata so uncertain, that while in some cases they give results incredibly short, like that of 15 millions of years for the whole past processof formation of the solar system, in others they give results almost incredibly long, as in that which supposes the moon to have beenthrown off when the Earth was rotating in three hours, while the utmost actual retardation obtained from observation would require600 millions of years to make it rotate in twenty-three hours instead of twenty-four\" (p. 48).

When a planetary chain is in its last Round, its Globe 1 or A, before finally dying out, sends all its energy and\"principles\" into a neutral centre of latent force, a \"laya centre,\" and thereby informs a new nucleus of undifferentiated substance ormatter, i.e., calls it into activity or gives it life. Suppose such a process to have taken place in the lunar \"planetary\" chain; supposeagain, for argument's sake (though Mr. Darwin's theory quoted below has lately been upset, even if the fact has not yet beenascertained by mathematical calculation) that the moon is far older than the Earth. Imagine the six fellow-globes of the moon --aeons before the first globe of our seven was evolved -- just in the same position in relation to each other as the fellow-globes of ourchain occupy in regard to our Earth now. (See in \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" \"The Constitution of Man,\" and the \"Planetary Chain.\") Andnow it will be easy to imagine further Globe A of the lunar chain informing Globe A of the terrestrial chain, and -- dying; Globe B ofthe former sending after that its energy into Globe B of the new chain; then Globe C of the lunar, creating its progeny sphere C of theterrene chain; then the Moon (our Satellite*) pouring forth into[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* She is the satellite, undeniably, but this does not invalidate the theory that she has given to the Earth all but her corpse. ForDarwin's theory to hold good, besides the hypothesis just upset (vide last footnote), other still more incongruous speculations had to beinvented. The Moon, it is said, has cooled nearly six times as rapidly as the Earth (Winchell's \"World-Life\"): \"The Moon, if the earth is14,000,000 years old since its incrustation, is only eleven and two thirds millions of years old since that stage . . .\" etc. And if ourMoon is but a splash from our Earth, why can no similar inference be established for the Moons of other planets? The Astronomers \"donot know.\" Why should Venus and Mercury have no satellites, and by what, when they exist, were they formed? Because, we say,science has only one key -- the key of matter -- to open the mysteries of nature withal, while occult philosophy has seven keys andexplains that which science fails to see. Mercury and Venus have no satellites but they had \"parents\" just as the earth had. Both arefar older than the Earth and, before the latter reaches her seventh Round, her mother Moon will have dissolved [[Footnote continuedon next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 156 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the lowest globe of our planetary ring -- Globe D, our Earth -- all its life, energy and powers; and, having transferred them to a newcentre becoming virtually a dead planet, in which rotation has almost ceased since the birth of our globe. The Moon is now the coldresidual quantity, the shadow dragged after the new body, into which her living powers and \"principles\" are transfused. She now isdoomed for long ages to be ever pursuing the Earth, to be attracted by and to attract her progeny. Constantly vampirised by her child,she revenges herself on it by soaking it through and through with the nefarious, invisible, and poisoned influence which emanatesfrom the occult side of her nature. For she is a dead, yet a living body. The particles of her decaying corpse are full of active anddestructive life, although the body which they had formed is soulless and lifeless. Therefore its emanations are at the same timebeneficent and maleficent -- this circumstance finding its parallel on earth in the fact that the grass and plants are nowhere more juicyand thriving than on the graves; while at the same time it is the graveyard or corpse-emanations, which kill. And like all ghouls orvampires, the moon is the friend of the sorcerers and the foe of the unwary. From the archaic aeons and the later times of the witchesof Thessaly, down to some of the present tantrikas of Bengal, her nature and properties were known to every Occultist, but haveremained a closed book for physicists.Such is the moon from the astronomical, geological, and physical standpoints. As to her metaphysical and psychic nature it mustremain an occult secret in this work, as it was in the volume on \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" notwithstanding the rather sanguine statementmade therein on p. 113 (5th edition) that \"there is not much mystery left now in the riddle of the eighth sphere.\" These are topics,indeed, \"on which the adepts are very reserved in their communications to uninitiated pupils,\" and since they have, moreover, neversanctioned or permitted any published speculations upon them, the less said the better.Yet without treading upon the forbidden ground of the \"eighth sphere,\" it may be useful to state some additional facts with regard toex-monads of the lunar chain -- the \"lunar ancestors\" -- as they play a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] into thin air, as the \"Moons\" of the other planets have, or have not, as the case may be,since there are planets which have several moons -- a mystery again which no OEdipus of astronomy has solved."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 157 OPINIONS DIFFER AND YET AGREE.leading part in the coming Anthropogenesis. This brings us directly to the septenary constitution of man; and as some discussion hasarisen of late about the best classification to be adopted for the division of the microcosmic entity, two systems are now appendedwith a view to facilitate comparison. The subjoined short article is from the pen of Mr. T. Subba Row, a learned Vedantin scholar. Heprefers the Brahmanical division of the Raja Yoga, and from a metaphysical point of view he is quite right. But, as it is a question ofsimple choice and expediency, we hold in this work to the \"time-honoured\" classification of the trans-Himalayan \"Arhat EsotericSchool.\" The following table and its explanatory text are reprinted from the \"Theosophist\" of Madras, and they are also contained in\"Five Years of Theosophy\":--SEPTENARY DIVISION IN DIFFERENT INDIAN SYSTEMS.\"We give below in a tabular form the classifications adopted by the Buddhist and Vedantic teachers of the principles of man:--CLASSIFICATION IN ESOTERIC BUDDHISM.1.

It will also be seen that the Fourth principle is included in the third Kosa(Sheath), as the same principle is but the vehicle of will-power, which is but an energy of the mind. It must also be noticed that theVignanamaya Kosa is considered to be distinct from the Manomaya Kosa, as a division is made after death between the lower part ofthe mind, as it were, which has a closer affinity with the fourth principle than with the sixth; and its higher part, which attaches itself tothe latter, and which is, in fact, the basis for the higher spiritual individuality of man.We may also here point out to our readers that the classification mentioned in the last column is, for all practical purposes, connectedwith Raja Yoga, the best and simplest. Though there are seven principles in man, there are but three distinct Upadhis (bases), in eachof which his Atma may work independently of the rest. These three Upadhis can be separated by an Adept without killing himself. Hecannot separate the seven principles from each other without destroying his constitution.\""},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The student will now be better prepared to see that between the three Upadhis of the Raja Yoga and its Atma, and our three Upadhis,Atma, and the additional three divisions, there is in reality but very little difference. Moreover, as every adept in cis-Himalayan ortrans-Himalayan India, of the Patanjali, the Aryasanga or the Mahayana schools, has to become a Raja Yogi, he must, therefore,accept the Taraka Raja classification in principle and theory whatever classification he resorts to for practical and occult purposes.Thus, it matters very little whether one speaks of the three Upadhis with their three aspects and Atma, the eternal and immortalsynthesis, or calls them the \"seven principles.\"For the benefit of those who may not have read, or, if they have, may not have clearly understood, in Theosophical writings, thedoctrine of the septenary chains of worlds in the Solar Kosmos, the teaching is briefly thus:--1. Everything in the metaphysical as in the physical Universe is septenary. Hence every sidereal body, every planet, whether visible------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 159 THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF THE EGO.or invisible, is credited with six companion globes. (See Diagram No. 3, after verse 6 of this commentary.) The evolution of lifeproceeds on these seven globes or bodies from the 1st to the 7th in Seven ROUNDS or Seven Cycles.2. These globes are formed by a process which the Occultists call the \"rebirth of planetary chains (or rings).\" When the seventh andlast Round of one of such rings has been entered upon, the highest or first globe \"A,\" followed by all the others down to the last,instead of entering upon a certain time of rest -- or \"obscuration,\" as in their previous Rounds -- begins to die out. The \"planetary\"dissolution (pralaya) is at hand, and its hour has struck; each globe has to transfer its life and energy to another planet. (See diagramNo. 2 infra, \"The Moon and the Earth.\")3. Our Earth, as the visible representative of its invisible superior fellow globes, its \"lords\" or \"principles\" (see diagram No. 1), has tolive, as have the others, through seven Rounds. During the first three, it forms and consolidates; during the fourth it settles andhardens; during the last three it gradually returns to its first ethereal form: it is spiritualised, so to say.4. Its Humanity develops fully only in the Fourth -- our present Round. Up to this fourth Life-Cycle, it is referred to as \"humanity\" onlyfor lack of a more appropriate term. Like the grub which becomes chrysalis and butterfly, Man, or rather that which becomes man,passes through all the forms and kingdoms during the first Round and through all the human shapes during the two following Rounds.Arrived on our Earth at the commencement of the Fourth in the present series of life-cycles and races, MAN is the first form thatappears thereon, being preceded only by the mineral and vegetable kingdoms -- even the latter having to develop and continue itsfurther evolution through man. This will be explained in Book II. During the three Rounds to come, Humanity, like the globe on whichit lives, will be ever tending to reassume its primeval form, that of a Dhyan Chohanic Host. Man tends to become a God and then --GOD, like every other atom in the Universe.\"Beginning so early as with the 2nd round, Evolution proceeds already on quite a different plan. It is only during the 1st round that(heavenly) man becomes a human being on globe A (rebecomes) a mineral, a plant, an animal, on globe B and C, etc. The processchanges------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 160 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.entirely from the second round -- but you have learned prudence . . . and I advise you to say nothing before the time for saying it hascome. . .\" (Extract from the Teacher's letters on various topics.)5. Every life-cycle on Globe D (our Earth)* is composed of seven root-races. They commence with the Ethereal and end with thespiritual on the double line of physical and moral evolution -- from the beginning of the terrestrial round to its close. (One is a\"planetary round\" from Globe A to Globe G, the seventh; the other, the \"globe round,\" or the terrestrial).This is very well described in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" and needs no further elucidation for the time being.6. The first root-race, i.e., the first \"men\" on earth (irrespective of form) were the progeny of the \"celestial men,\" called rightly in Indianphilosophy the \"Lunar Ancestors\" or the Pitris, of which there are seven classes or Hierarchies. As all this will be sufficiently explainedin the following sections and in Book II., no more need be said of it here.But the two works already mentioned, both of which treat of subjects from the occult doctrine, need particular notice. \"EsotericBuddhism\" is too well known in Theosophical circles, and even to the outside world, for it to be necessary to enter at length upon itsmerits here. It is an excellent book, and has done still more excellent work. But this does not alter the fact that it contains somemistaken notions, and that it has led many Theosophists and lay-readers to form an erroneous conception of the Secret EasternDoctrines. Moreover it seems, perhaps, a little too materialistic.\"MAN,\" which came later, was an attempt to present the archaic doctrine from a more ideal standpoint, to translate some visions inand from the Astral Light, to render some teachings partly gathered from a Master's thoughts, but unfortunately misunderstood. Thiswork also speaks of the evolution of the early Races of men on Earth, and contains some excellent pages of a philosophical character.But so far it is only an interesting little mystical romance. It has failed in its mission, because the conditions required for a correct"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"translation of these visions were not present. Hence the reader must not wonder if our Volumes contradict these earlier descriptions inseveral particulars.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We are not concerned with the other Globes in this work except incidentally.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 161 A RE-ADJUSTMENT OF FACTS.Esoteric \"Cosmogony\" in general, and the evolution of the human Monad especially, differ so essentially in these two books and inother Theosophical works written independently by beginners, that it becomes impossible to proceed with the present work withoutspecial mention of these two earlier volumes, for both have a number of admirers -- \"Esoteric Buddhism\" especially. The time hasarrived for the explanation of some matters in this direction. Mistakes have now to be checked by the original teachings and corrected.If one of the said works has too pronounced a bias toward materialistic science, the other is decidedly too idealistic, and is, at times,fantastic.From the doctrine -- rather incomprehensible to western minds -- which deals with the periodical \"obscurations\" and successive\"Rounds\" of the Globes along their circular chains, were born the first perplexities and misconceptions. One of such has reference tothe \"Fifth-\" and even \"Sixth-Rounders.\" Those who knew that a Round was preceded and followed by a long Pralaya, a pause of restwhich created an impassable gulf between two Rounds until the time came for a renewed cycle of life, could not understand the\"fallacy\" of talking about \"fifth and sixth Rounders\" in our Fourth Round. Gautama Buddha, it was held, was a Sixth-Rounder, Platoand some other great philosophers and minds, \"Fifth-Rounders.\" How could it be? One Master taught and affirmed that there weresuch \"Fifth-Rounders\" even now on Earth; and though understood to say that mankind was yet \"in the Fourth Round,\" in another placehe seemed to say that we were in the Fifth. To this an \"apocalyptic answer\" was returned by another Teacher:-- \"A few drops of rain donot make a Monsoon, though they presage it.\" . . . \"No, we are not in the Fifth Round, but Fifth Round men have been coming in forthe last few thousand years.\" This was worse than the riddle of the Sphinx! Students of Occultism subjected their brains to the wildestwork of speculation. For a considerable time they tried to outvie OEdipus and reconcile the two statements. And as the Masters kept assilent as the stony Sphinx herself, they were accused of inconsistency, \"contradiction,\" and \"discrepancies.\" But they were simplyallowing the speculations to go on, in order to teach a lesson which the Western mind sorely needs. In their conceit and arrogance, asin their habit of materializing every metaphysical conception and term without allowing any margin for Eastern------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 162 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.metaphor and allegory, the Orientalists have made a jumble of the Hindu exoteric philosophy, and the Theosophists were now doingthe same with regard to esoteric teachings. To this day it is evident that the latter have utterly failed to understand the meaning of theterm \"Fifth and Sixth Rounders.\" But it is simply this: every \"Round\" brings about a new development and even an entire change inthe mental, psychic, spiritual and physical constitution of man, all these principles evoluting on an ever ascending scale. Thence itfollows that those persons who, like Confucius and Plato, belonged psychically, mentally and spiritually to the higher planes ofevolution, were in our Fourth Round as the average man will be in the Fifth Round, whose mankind is destined to find itself, on thisscale of Evolution, immensely higher than is our present humanity. Similarly Gautama Buddha -- Wisdom incarnate -- was still higherand greater than all the men we have mentioned, who are called Fifth Rounders, while Buddha and Sankaracharya are termed SixthRounders, allegorically. Thence again the concealed wisdom of the remark, pronounced at the time \"evasive\" -- that a few drops ofrain do not make the Monsoon, though they presage it.\"And now the truth of the remark made in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" by its author will be fully apparent:--\"It is impossible, when the complicated facts of an entirely unfamiliar science are being presented to untrained minds for the firsttime, to put them forward with all their appropriate qualifications . . . and abnormal developments. . . . We must be content to take thebroad rules first and deal with the exceptions afterwards, and especially is this the case with study, in connection with which thetraditional methods of teaching, generally followed, aim at impressing every fresh idea on the memory by provoking the perplexity itat last relieves.\"As the author of the remark was himself, as he says, \"an untrained mind\" in Occultism, his own inferences, and his better knowledge ofmodern astronomical speculations than of archaic doctrines led him quite naturally, and as unconsciously to himself, to commit a fewmistakes of detail rather than of any \"broad rule.\" One such will now be noticed. It is a trifling one, still it is calculated to lead many abeginner into erroneous conceptions. But as the mistaken notions of the earlier editions were corrected in the annotations of the fifthedition, so the sixth may be revised and perfected. There were several reasons------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 163 LIKE QUESTIONS, LIKE ANSWERS.for such mistakes. (1) They were due to the necessity under which the teachers laboured of giving what were considered as \"evasiveanswers\": the questions being too persistently pressed to be left unnoticed, while, on the other hand, they could only be partiallyanswered. (2) This position notwithstanding, the confession that \"half a loaf is better than no bread\" was but too often misunderstoodand hardly appreciated as it ought to have been. As a result thereof gratuitous speculations were sometimes indulged in by theEuropean lay-chelas. Among such were (a) the \"Mystery of the Eighth Sphere\" in its relation to the Moon; and (b) the erroneous"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"statement that two of the superior Globes of the terrestrial chain were two of our well-known planets: \"besides the Earth . . . there areonly two other worlds of our chain which are visible. . . . Mars and Mercury. . . .\" (Esoteric Buddhism; p. 136.)This was a great mistake. But the blame for it is to be attached as much to the vagueness and incompleteness of the Master's answeras to the question of the learner itself, which was equally vague and indefinite.It was asked: \"What planets, of those known to ordinary science, besides Mercury, belong to our system of worlds?\" Now if by \"Systemof Worlds\" our terrestrial chain or \"string\" was intended in the mind of the querist, instead of the \"Solar System of Worlds,\" as it shouldhave been, then of course the answer was likely to be misunderstood. For the reply was: \"Mars, etc., and four other planets of whichastronomy knows nothing. Neither A, B, nor YZ are known nor can they be seen through physical means however perfected.\" This isplain: (a) Astronomy as yet knows nothing in reality of the planets, neither the ancient ones, nor those discovered in modern times. (b)No companion planets from A to Z, i.e., no upper globes of any chain in the Solar System, can be seen.* As to Mars, Mercury, and\"the four other planets,\" they bear[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* With the exception of course of all the planets which come fourth in number, as our earth, the moon, etc., etc. Copies of all theletters ever received or sent, with the exception of a few private ones -- \"in which there was no teaching\" the Master says -- are with thewriter. As it was her duty, in the beginning, to answer and explain certain points not touched upon, it is more than likely thatnotwithstanding the many annotations on these copies, the writer, in her ignorance of English and her fear of saying too much, mayhave bungled the information given. She takes the whole blame for it upon herself in any and every case. But it is impossible for herto allow students to remain any longer under erroneous impressions, or to believe that the fault lies with the esoteric system.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 164 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.a relation to Earth of which no master or high Occultist will ever speak, much less explain the nature.*Let it now be distinctly stated, then, that the theory broached is impossible, with or without the additional evidence furnished bymodern Astronomy. Physical Science can supply corroborative, though still very uncertain, evidence, but only as regards heavenlybodies on the same plane of materiality as our objective Universe. Mars and Mercury, Venus and Jupiter, like every hithertodiscovered planet (or those still to be discovered), are all, per se, the representatives on our plane of such chains. As distinctly statedin one of the numerous letters of Mr. Sinnett's \"Teacher,\" \"there are other and innumerable Manvantaric chains of globes which bearintelligent Beings both in and outside our solar system.\" But neither Mars nor Mercury belong to our chain. They are, along with theother planets, septenary Units in the great host of \"chains\" of our system, and all are as visible as their upper globes are invisible.If it is still argued that certain expressions in the Teacher's letters were liable to mislead, the answer comes:-- Amen; so it was. Theauthor of \"Esoteric Buddhism\" understood it well when he wrote that such are \"the traditional modes of teaching . . . by provoking theperplexity\" . . . they do, or do not relieve -- as the case may be. At all events, if it is urged that this might have been explained earlier,and the true nature of the planets given out as they now are, the answer comes that: \"it was not found expedient to do so at the time,as it would have opened the way to a series of additional questions which could never be answered on account of their esotericnature, and thus would only become embarrassing.\" It had been declared from the first and has been repeatedly asserted since that(1st) no Theosophist, not even as an accepted chela -- let alone lay students -- could expect to have the secret teachings explained tohim thoroughly and completely, before he had irretrievably pledged himself to the Brotherhood and passed through at least oneinitiation, because no figures and numbers could be given to the public, for figures and numbers are the key to the esoteric system.(2.) That[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In this same letter the impossibility is distinctly stated:-- . . . \"Try to understand that you are putting me questions pertaining to thehighest initiation; that I can give you (only) a general view, but that I dare not nor will I enter upon details . . .\" wrote one of theTeachers to the author of \"Esoteric Buddhism.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 165 AN AUTHORITATIVE LETTER.what was revealed was merely the esoteric lining of that which is contained in almost all the exoteric Scriptures of the world-religions -- pre-eminently in the Brahmanas, and the Upanishads of the Vedas and even in the Puranas. It was a small portion of what isdivulged far more fully now in the present volumes; and even this is very incomplete and fragmentary.When the present work was commenced, the writer, feeling sure that the speculation about Mars and Mercury was a mistake, appliedto the Teachers by letter for explanation and an authoritative version. Both came in due time, and verbatim extracts from these arenow given.\". . . . . It is quite correct that Mars is in a state of obscuration at present, and Mercury just beginning to get out of it. You might addthat Venus is in her last Round. . . . . . . . . . . If neither Mercury nor Venus have satellites, it is because of the reasons . . . (videfootnote supra, where those reasons are given), and also because Mars has two satellites to which he has no right. . . . . Phobos, thesupposed INNER satellite, is no satellite at all. As remarked long ago by Laplace and now by Faye (see COMPTES RENDUS, Tome"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"XC., p. 569), Phobos keeps a too short periodic time, and therefore there 'must exist some defect in the mother idea of the theory' asFaye justly observes. . . . . Again, both (Mars and Mercury) are septenary chains, as independent of the Earth's sidereal lords andsuperiors as you are independent of the 'principles' of Daumling (Tom Thumb) -- which were perhaps his six brothers, with or withoutnight-caps. . . . . . . . . . 'Gratification of curiosity is the end of knowledge for some men,' was said by Bacon, who was as right inpostulating this truism, as those who were familiar with it before him were right in hedging off WISDOM from Knowledge, and tracinglimits to that which is to be given out at one time. . . . Remember:--'. . . . . . . . . . . knowledge dwellsIn heads replete with thoughts of other men,Wisdom in minds attentive to their own. . . .'You can never impress it too profoundly on the minds of those to whom you impart some of the esoteric teachings. . .\"Again, here are more extracts from another letter written by the same authority.

He had declared thatif there were such companion Earths \"they must be only a wee bit less material than our globe.\" How then was it that they could notbe seen? The answer was:--\". . . . Were psychic and spiritual teachings more fully understood, it would become next to impossible to even imagine such anincongruity. Unless less trouble is taken to reconcile the irreconcileable -- that is to say, the metaphysical and spiritual sciences withphysical or natural philosophy, 'natural' being a synonym to them (men of science) of that matter which falls under the perception oftheir corporeal senses -- no progress can be really achieved. Our Globe, as taught from the first, is at the bottom of the arc of descent,where the matter of our perceptions exhibits itself in its grossest form. . . . . . . Hence it only stands to reason that the globes whichovershadow our Earth must be on different and superior planes. In short, as Globes, they are in CO-ADUNITION but not INCONSUBSTANTIALITY WITH OUR EARTH and thus pertain to quite another state of consciousness. Our planet (like all those we see)is adapted to the peculiar state of its human stock, that state which enables us to see with our naked eye the sidereal bodies which areco-essential with our terrene plane and substance, just as their respective inhabitants, the Jovians, Martians and others can perceiveour little world: because our planes of consciousness, differing as they do in degree but being the same in kind, are on the same layerof differentiated matter. . . . . What I wrote was 'The minor Pralaya concerns only our little STRINGS OF GLOBES.' (We called chains'Strings' in those days of lip-confusion.) . . . 'To such a string our Earth belongs.' This ought to have shown plainly that the otherplanets were also 'strings' or CHAINS. . . If he (meaning the objector) would perceive even the dim silhouette of one of such 'planets'on the higher planes, he has to first throw off even the thin clouds of the astral matter that stands between him and the next plane. . . ..\"It becomes patent why we could not perceive, even with the help of the best earthly telescopes, that which is outside our world ofmatter.

And they tell us plainly:--\"Lead the life necessary for the acquisition of such knowledge and powers, and Wisdom will come to you naturally.

Meanwhile, be prudent. Do not give out thegreat Truths that are the inheritance of the future Races, to our present generation. Do not attempt to unveil the secret of being andnon-being to those unable to see the hidden meaning of Apollo's HEPTACHORD -- the lyre of the radiant god, in each of the sevenstrings of which dwelleth the Spirit, Soul and Astral body of the Kosmos, whose shell only has now fallen into the hands of ModernScience. . . . . .

To a correspondent who called a \"Round\" a \"World-Ring,\" the Teacher wrote: \"I believe this willlead to a further confusion. A Round we are agreed to call the passage------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 168 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of a monad from Globe A to Globe G or Z. . . The 'World-Ring' is correct. . . Advise Mr. . . . strongly, to agree upon a nomenclaturebefore going any further. . . \"Notwithstanding this agreement, many mistakes, owing to this confusion, crept into the earliest teachings. The Races even wereoccasionally mixed up with the \"Rounds\" and \"Rings,\" and led to similar mistakes in \"Man.\" From the first the Master had written --\"Not being permitted to give you the whole truth, or divulge the number of isolated fractions . . . I am unable to satisfy you.\"This in answer to the questions, \"If we are right, then the total existence prior to the man-period is 637,\" etc., etc. To all the queriesrelating to figures, the reply was, \"Try to solve the problem of 777 incarnations. . . . Though I am obliged to withhold information . . .yet if you should work out the problem by yourself, it will be my duty to tell you so.\"But they never were so worked out, and the results were -- never-ceasing perplexity and mistakes.Even the teaching about the Septenary constitution of the sidereal bodies and of the macrocosm -- from which the septenary divisionof the microcosm, or Man -- has until now been among the most esoteric. In olden times it used to be divulged only at the Initiationand along with the most sacred figures of the cycles. Now, as stated in one of the Theosophical journals,* the revelation of the wholesystem of Cosmogony had not been contemplated, nor even thought for one moment possible, at a time when a few bits ofinformation were sparingly given out in answer to letters written by the author of \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" in which he put forward amultiplicity of questions. Among these were questions on such problems as no MASTER, however high and independent he might be,would have the right to answer, thus divulging to the world the most time-honoured and archaic of the mysteries of the ancientcollege-temples. Hence only a few of the doctrines were revealed in their broad outlines, while details were constantly withheld, andall the efforts made to elicit more information about them were systematically eluded from the beginning. This is perfectly natural. Ofthe four Vidyas -- out of the seven branches of Knowledge mentioned in the Puranas -- namely, \"Yajna-Vidya\" (the performance ofreligious rites in order to[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Lucifer,\" May, 1888.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 169 THE SEVEN BRANCHES OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.produce certain results); \"Maha-Vidya,\" the great (Magic) knowledge, now degenerated into Tantrika worship; \"Guhya-Vidya,\" thescience of Mantras and their true rhythm or chanting, of mystical incantations, etc. -- it is only the last one, \"Atma-Vidya,\" or the trueSpiritual and Divine wisdom, which can throw absolute and final light upon the teachings of the three first named. Without the help ofAtma-Vidya, the other three remain no better than surface sciences, geometrical magnitudes having length and breadth, but nothickness. They are like the soul, limbs, and mind of a sleeping man: capable of mechanical motions, of chaotic dreams and evensleep-walking, of producing visible effects, but stimulated by instinctual not intellectual causes, least of all by fully conscious spiritualimpulses. A good deal can be given out and explained from the three first-named sciences. But unless the key to their teachings isfurnished by Atma-Vidya, they will remain for ever like the fragments of a mangled text-book, like the adumbrations of great truths,dimly perceived by the most spiritual, but distorted out of all proportion by those who would nail every shadow to the wall.Then, again, another great perplexity was created in the minds of students by the incomplete exposition of the doctrine of theevolution of the Monads. To be fully realised, both this process and that of the birth of the Globes must be examined far more fromtheir metaphysical aspect than from what one might call a statistical standpoint, involving figures and numbers which are rarelypermitted to be broadly used. Unfortunately, there are few who are inclined to handle these doctrines only metaphysically. Even thebest of the Western writers upon our doctrine declares in his work that \"on pure metaphysics of that sort we are not now engaged,\"when speaking of the evolution of the Monads (\"Esoteric Buddhism,\" p. 46). And in such case, as the Teacher remarks in a letter tohim, \"Why this preaching of our doctrines, all this uphill work and swimming in adversum flumen? Why should the West . . . learn . . .from the East . . . that which can never meet the requirements of the special tastes of the aesthetics?\" And he draws hiscorrespondent's attention \"to the formidable difficulties encountered by us (the Adepts) in every attempt we make to explain ourmetaphysics to the Western mind.\"And well he may; for outside of metaphysics no occult philosophy, no esotericism is possible.

On p. 47 (fifth edition) it is said:--\" . . . the spiritual monads . . . do not fully complete their mineral existence on Globe A, then complete it on Globe B, and so on.They pass several times round the whole circle as minerals, and then again several times round as vegetables, and several times asanimals. We purposely refrain for the present from going into figures,\" etc., etc.This was a wise course to adopt in view of the great secrecy maintained with regard to figures and numbers. This reticence is nowpartially relinquished; but it would perhaps have been better had the real numbers concerning Rounds and evolutional gyrationsbeen either entirely divulged at the time, or as entirely withheld. Mr. Sinnett understood this difficulty well when saying (p. 140) that:\"For reasons which are not easy for the outsider to divine, the possessors of occult knowledge are especially reluctant to give out factsrelating to Cosmogony, though it is hard for the uninitiated to understand why they should be withheld.\"That there were such reasons is evident. Nevertheless, it is to this reticence that most of the confused ideas of some Eastern as well asWestern pupils are due. The difficulties in the way of the acceptance of the two particular tenets under consideration seemed great,just because of the absence of any data to go upon. But there it was. For the figures belonging to the Occult calculations cannot begiven -- as the Masters have many times declared -- outside the circle of pledged chelas, and not even these can break the rules.To make things plainer, without touching upon the mathematical aspects of the doctrine, the teaching given may be expanded andsome obscure------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 171 THE MYSTERY OF THE MOON, UNVEILED.points solved. As the evolution of the Globes and that of the Monads are so closely interblended, we will make of the two teachingsone. In reference to the Monads, the reader is asked to bear in mind that Eastern philosophy rejects the Western theological dogma ofa newly-created soul for every baby born, as being as unphilosophical as it is impossible in the economy of Nature. There must be alimited number of Monads evolving and growing more and more perfect through their assimilation of many successive personalities,in every new Manvantara. This is absolutely necessary in view of the doctrines of Rebirth, Karma, and the gradual return of the humanMonad to its source -- absolute Deity. Thus, although the hosts of more or less progressed Monads are almost incalculable, they arestill finite, as is everything in this Universe of differentiation and finiteness.As shown in the double diagram of the human \"principles\" and the ascending Globes of the world-chains, there is an eternalconcatenation of causes and effects, and a perfect analogy which runs through, and links together, all the lines of evolution. Onebegets the other -- globes as personalities. But, let us begin at the beginning.The general outline of the process by which the successive planetary chains are formed has just been given. To prevent futuremisconceptions, some further details may be offered which will also throw light on the history of humanity on our own chain, theprogeny of that of the Moon.In the diagrams on p. 172, Fig. 1 represents the \"lunar-chain\" of seven planets at the outset of its seventh or last Round; while Fig. 2represents the \"earth-chain\" which will be, but is not yet in existence. The seven Globes of each chain are distinguished in their cyclicorder by the letters A to G, the Globes of the Earth-chain being further marked by a cross -- + -- the symbol of the Earth.Now, it must be remembered that the Monads cycling round any septenary chain are divided into seven classes or hierarchiesaccording to their respective stages of evolution, consciousness, and merit. Let us follow, then, the order of their appearance onplanet A, in the first Round. The time-spaces between the appearances of these hierarchies on any one Globe are so adjusted thatwhen Class 7, the last, appears on Globe A, Class 1, the first, has just passed on to Globe B, and so on, step by step, all round thechain.Again, in the Seventh Round on the Lunar chain, when Class 7, the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 172 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.last, quits Globe A, that Globe, instead of falling asleep, as it had done in previous Rounds, begins to die (to go into its planetarypralaya);* and in dying it transfers successively, as just said, its \"principles,\" or life-elements and energy, etc., one after the other to anew \"laya-centre,\" which commences the formation of Globe A of the Earth Chain. A similar process takes place for each of theGlobes of the \"lunar chain\" one after the other, each forming a fresh Globe of the \"earth-chain.\" Our Moon was the fourth Globe ofthe series, and was"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"EARTH CHAIN.FIG. 2.A+ G+B+ F+C+ E+D+ (Our Earth)LUNAR CHAIN.FIG. 1.A GB FC ED (Our Moon)DIAGRAM II.[[above is in diagram format in the original text]]on the same plane of perception as our Earth. But Globe A of the lunar chain is not fully \"dead\" till the first Monads of the first classhave passed from Globe G or Z, the last of the \"lunar chain,\" into the Nirvana[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Occultism divides the periods of Rest (Pralaya) into several kinds; there is the individual pralaya of each Globe, as humanity and lifepass on to the next; seven minor Pralayas in each Round; the planetary Pralaya, when seven Rounds are completed; the SolarPralaya, when the whole system is at an end; and finally the Universal Maha -- or Brahma -- Pralaya at the close of the \"Age ofBrahma.\" These are the three chief pralayas or \"destruction periods.\" There are many other minor ones, but with these we are notconcerned at present.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 173 THE EARTH, THE CHILD OF THE MOON.which awaits them between the two chains; and similarly for all the other Globes as stated, each giving birth to the correspondingglobe of the \"earth-chain.\"Further, when Globe A of the new chain is ready, the first class or Hierarchy of Monads from the Lunar chain incarnate upon it in thelowest kingdom, and so on successively. The result of this is, that it is only the first class of Monads which attains the human state ofdevelopment during the first Round, since the second class, on each planet, arriving later, has not time to reach that stage. Thus theMonads of Class 2 reach the incipient human stage only in the Second Round, and so on up to the middle of the Fourth Round. Butat this point -- and on this Fourth Round in which the human stage will be fully developed -- the \"Door\" into the human kingdomcloses; and henceforward the number of \"human\" Monads, i.e., Monads in the human stage of development, is complete. For theMonads which had not reached the human stage by this point will, owing to the evolution of humanity itself, find themselves so farbehind that they will reach the human stage only at the close of the seventh and last Round. They will, therefore, not be men on thischain, but will form the humanity of a future Manvantara and be rewarded by becoming \"Men\" on a higher chain altogether, thusreceiving their Karmic compensation. To this there is but one solitary exception, for very good reasons, of which we shall speak fartheron. But this accounts for the difference in the races.It thus becomes apparent how perfect is the analogy between the processes of Nature in the Kosmos and in the individual man. Thelatter lives through his life-cycle, and dies. His \"higher principles,\" corresponding in the development of a planetary chain to thecycling Monads, pass into Devachan, which corresponds to the \"Nirvana\" and states of rest intervening between two chains. The Man'slower \"principles\" are disintegrated in time and are used by Nature again for the formation of new human principles, and the sameprocess takes place in the disintegration and formation of Worlds. Analogy is thus the surest guide to the comprehension of the Occultteachings.This is one of the \"seven mysteries of the Moon,\" and it is now revealed. The seven \"mysteries\" are called by the JapaneseYamaboosis, the mystics of the Lao-Tze sect and the ascetic monks of Kioto, the Dzenodoo -- the \"seven jewels.\" Only the Japaneseand the Chinese------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 174 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Buddhist ascetics and Initiates are, if possible, even more reticent in giving out their \"Knowledge\" than are the Hindus.But the reader must not be allowed to lose sight of the Monads, and must be enlightened as to their nature, as far as permitted,without trespassing upon the highest mysteries, of which the writer does not in any way pretend to know the last or final word."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Monadic Host may be roughly divided into three great classes:--1. The most developed Monads (the Lunar Gods or \"Spirits,\" called, in India, the Pitris), whose function it is to pass in the first Roundthrough the whole triple cycle of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms in their most ethereal, filmy, and rudimentary forms, inorder to clothe themselves in, and assimilate, the nature of the newly formed chain. They are those who first reach the human form (ifthere can be any form in the realm of the almost subjective) on Globe A in the first Round. It is they, therefore, who lead andrepresent the human element during the second and third Rounds, and finally evolve their shadows at the beginning of the FourthRound for the second class, or those who come behind them.2. Those Monads that are the first to reach the human stage during the three and a half Rounds, and to become men.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We are forced to use here the misleading word \"Men,\" and this is a clear proof of how little any European language is adapted toexpress these subtle distinctions.It stands to reason that these \"Men\" did not resemble the men of to-day, either in form or nature. Why then, it may be asked, call them\"Men\" at all? Because there is no other term in any Western language which approximately conveys the idea intended. The word\"Men\" at least indicates that these beings were \"MANUS,\" thinking entities, however they differed in form and intellection fromourselves. But in reality they were, in respect of spirituality and intellection, rather \"gods\" than \"Men.\"The same difficulty of language is met with in describing the \"stages\" through which the Monad passes. Metaphysically speaking, it isof course an absurdity to talk of the \"development\" of a Monad, or to say that it becomes \"Man.\" But any attempt to preservemetaphysical accuracy of language in the use of such a tongue as the English would necessitate at least three extra volumes of thiswork, and would entail an amount of verbal repetition which would be wearisome in the extreme. It stands to reason that a MONADcannot either progress or develop, or even be affected by the changes of states it passes through. It is not of this world or plane, andmay be compared only to an indestructible star of divine light and fire, thrown down on to our [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 175 THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MONADS.3. The laggards; the Monads which are retarded, and which will not reach, by reason of Karmic impediments, the human stage at allduring this cycle or Round, save one exception which will be spoken of elsewhere as already promised.Now the evolution of the external form or body round the astral is produced by the terrestrial forces, just as in the case of the lowerkingdoms; but the evolution of the internal or real MAN is purely spiritual. It is now no more a passage of the impersonal Monadthrough many and various forms of matter -- endowed at best with instinct and consciousness on quite a different plane -- as in thecase of external evolution, but a journey of the \"pilgrim-soul\" through various states of not only matter but Self-consciousness and self-perception, or of perception from apperception. (See \"Gods, Monads and Atoms.\")The MONAD emerges from its state of spiritual and intellectual unconsciousness; and, skipping the first two planes -- too near theABSOLUTE to permit of any correlation with anything on a lower plane -- it gets direct into the plane of Mentality. But there is noplane in the whole universe with a wider margin, or a wider field of action in its almost endless gradations of perceptive andapperceptive qualities, than this plane, which has in its turn an appropriate smaller plane for every \"form,\" from the \"mineral\" monadup to the time when that monad blossoms forth by evolution into the DIVINE MONAD. But all the time it is still one and the sameMonad, differing only in its incarnations, throughout its ever succeeding cycles of partial or total obscuration of spirit, or the partial ortotal obscuration of matter -- two polar antitheses -- as it ascends into the realms of mental spirituality, or descends into the depths ofmateriality.To return to \"Esoteric Buddhism.\" It is there stated with regard to the enormous period intervening between the mineral epoch onGlobe A, and the man-epoch,* that: \"The full development of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Earth as a plank of salvation for the personalities in which it indwells. It is for the latter tocling to it; and thus partaking of its divine nature, obtain immortality. Left to itself the Monad will cling to no one; but, like the \"plank,\"be drifted away to another incarnation by the unresting current of evolution.* The term \"Man epoch\" is here used because of the necessity of giving a name to that fourth kingdom which follows the animal. Butin truth the \"Man\" on Globe A during the First Round is no Man, but only his prototype or dimensionless image from the astral regions.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 176 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.mineral epoch on Globe A, prepares the way for the vegetable development, and, as soon as this begins, the mineral life-impulseoverflows into Globe B. Then, when the vegetable development on Globe A is complete and the animal development begins, the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"vegetable life-impulse overflows to Globe B, and the mineral impulse passes on to Globe C. Then finally comes the human life-impulse on Globe A.\" (Page 49.)And so it goes on for three Rounds, when it slackens, and finally stops at the threshold of our Globe, at the Fourth Round; because thehuman period (of the true physical men to be), the seventh, is now reached. This is evident, for as said, \" . . . there are processes ofevolution which precede the mineral kingdom, and thus a wave of evolution, indeed several waves of evolution, precede the mineralwave in its progress round the spheres\" (ibid).And now we have to quote from another article, \"The Mineral Monad\" in \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" p. 273 et seq.\"There are seven kingdoms. The first group comprises three degrees of elementals, or nascent centres of forces -- from the first stage ofdifferentiation of (from) Mulaprakriti (or rather Pradhana, primordial homogeneous matter) to its third degree -- i.e., from fullunconsciousness to semi-perception; the second or higher group embraces the kingdoms from vegetable to man; the mineral kingdomthus forming the central or turning point in the degrees of the \"Monadic Essence,\" considered as an evoluting energy. Three stages(sub-physical) on the elemental side; the mineral kingdom; three stages on the objective physical* side -- these are the (first orpreliminary) seven links of the evolutionary chain.\"\"Preliminary\" because they are preparatory, and though belonging in fact to the natural, they yet would be more correctly describedas sub-natural evolution. This process makes a halt in its stages at the Third, at the threshold of the Fourth stage, when it becomes, onthe plane of the natural evolution, the first really manward stage, thus forming with the three elemental kingdoms, the ten, theSephirothal number. It is at this point that begins:--\"A descent of spirit into matter equivalent to an ascent in physical[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Physical\" here means differentiated for cosmical purposes and work; that \"physical side,\" nevertheless, if objective to theapperception of beings from other planes, is yet quite subjective to us on our plane.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 177 AS ABOVE, SO BELOW, IS THE LAW.evolution; a re-ascent from the deepest depths of materiality (the mineral) towards its status quo ante, with a corresponding dissipationof concrete organism -- up to Nirvana, the vanishing point of differentiated matter.\" (\"Five Years of Theosophy,\" p. 276.)Therefore it becomes evident why that which is pertinently called in Esoteric Buddhism \"Wave of Evolution,\" and mineral-, vegetable-, animal- and man-\"impulse,\" stops at the door of our Globe, at its Fourth cycle or Round. It is at this point that the Cosmic Monad(Buddhi) will be wedded to and become the vehicle of the Atmic Ray, i.e., it (Buddhi) will awaken to an apperception of it (Atman);and thus enter on the first step of a new septenary ladder of evolution, which will lead it eventually to the tenth (counting from thelowest upwards) of the Sephirothal tree, the Crown.Everything in the Universe follows analogy. \"As above, so below\"; Man is the microcosm of the Universe. That which takes place onthe spiritual plane repeats itself on the Cosmic plane. Concretion follows the lines of abstraction; corresponding to the highest must bethe lowest; the material to the spiritual. Thus, corresponding to the Sephirothal Crown (or upper triad) there are the three elementalKingdoms, which precede the Mineral (see diagram on p. 277 in Five Years of Theosophy), and which, using the language of theKabalists, answer in the Cosmic differentiation to the worlds of Form and Matter from the Super-Spiritual to the Archetypal.Now what is a \"Monad?\" And what relation does it bear to an Atom? The following reply is based upon the explanations given inanswer to these questions in the above-cited article: \"The Mineral Monad,\" written by the author.\"None whatever,\" is answered to the second question, \"to the atom or molecule as existing in the scientific conception at present. Itcan neither be compared with the microscopic organism, once classed among polygastric infusoria, and now regarded as vegetable,and classed among Algae; nor is it quite the Monas of the Peripatetics. Physically or constitutionally the mineral monad differs, ofcourse, from the human monad, which is neither physical nor can its constitution be rendered by chemical symbols and elements.\" Inshort, as the spiritual Monad is One, Universal, Boundless and Impartite, whose rays, nevertheless, form what we, in our ignorance,call the \"Individual Monads\" of men,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 178 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.so the Mineral Monad -- being at the opposite point of the circle -- is also One -- and from it proceed the countless physical atoms,which Science is beginning to regard as individualized.Otherwise how could one account for and explain mathematically the evolutionary and spiral progress of the Four Kingdoms? The\"Monad\" is the combination of the last two \"principles\" in man, the 6th and the 7th, and, properly speaking, the term \"human monad\"applies only to the dual soul (Atma-Buddhi), not to its highest spiritual vivifying Principle, Atma, alone. But since the Spiritual Soul, ifdivorced from the latter (Atma) could have no existence, no being, it has thus been called . . . . Now the Monadic, or rather Cosmic,Essence (if such a term be permitted) in the mineral, vegetable, and animal, though the same throughout the series of cycles from the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"lowest elemental up to the Deva Kingdom, yet differs in the scale of progression. It would be very misleading to imagine a Monad asa separate Entity trailing its slow way in a distinct path through the lower Kingdoms, and after an incalculable series of transformationsflowering into a human being; in short, that the Monad of a Humboldt dates back to the Monad of an atom of horneblende. Instead ofsaying a \"Mineral Monad,\" the more correct phraseology in physical Science, which differentiates every atom, would of course havebeen to call it \"the Monad manifesting in that form of Prakriti called the Mineral Kingdom.\" The atom, as represented in the ordinaryscientific hypothesis, is not a particle of something, animated by a psychic something, destined after aeons to blossom as a man. Butit is a concrete manifestation of the Universal Energy which itself has not yet become individualized; a sequential manifestation ofthe one Universal Monas. The ocean (of matter) does not divide into its potential and constituent drops until the sweep of the life-impulse reaches the evolutionary stage of man-birth. The tendency towards segregation into individual Monads is gradual, and in thehigher animals comes almost to the point. The Peripatetics applied the word Monas to the whole Kosmos, in the pantheistic sense;and the Occultists, while accepting this thought for convenience sake, distinguish the progressive stages of the evolution of theconcrete from the abstract by terms of which the \"Mineral, Vegetable, Animal, (etc.), Monad\" are examples. The term merely meansthat the tidal wave of spiritual evolution is passing through that arc of its circuit. The \"Monadic------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 179 THE LUNAR MONADS.Essence\" begins to imperceptibly differentiate towards individual consciousness in the Vegetable Kingdom. As the Monads areuncompounded things, as correctly defined by Leibnitz, it is the spiritual essence which vivifies them in their degrees ofdifferentiation, which properly constitutes the Monad -- not the atomic aggregation, which is only the vehicle and the substancethrough which thrill the lower and the higher degrees of intelligence.Leibnitz conceived of the Monads as elementary and indestructible units endowed with the power of giving and receiving with respectto other units, and thus of determining all spiritual and physical phenomena. It is he who invented the term apperception, whichtogether with nerve- (not perception, but rather) -- sensation, expresses the state of the Monadic consciousness through all theKingdoms up to Man.Thus it may be wrong on strictly metaphysical lines to call Atma-Buddhi a MONAD, since in the materialistic view it is dual andtherefore compound. But as Matter is Spirit, and vice versa; and since the Universe and the Deity which informs it are unthinkableapart from each other; so in the case of Atma-Buddhi. The latter being the vehicle of the former, Buddhi stands in the same relationto Atma, as Adam-Kadmon, the Kabalistic Logos, does to En-Soph, or Mulaprakriti to Parabrahm.A few words more of the Moon.What, it may be asked, are the \"Lunar Monads,\" just spoken of? The description of the seven classes of Pitris will come later, but nowsome general explanations may be given. It must be plain to everyone that they are Monads, who, having ended their life-cycle onthe lunar chain, which is inferior to the terrestrial chain, have incarnated on this one. But there are some further details which may beadded, though they border too closely on forbidden ground to be treated of fully. The last word of the mystery is divulged only to theadepts, but it may be stated that our satellite is only the gross body of its invisible principles. Seeing then that there are 7 Earths, sothere are 7 Moons, the last one alone being visible; the same for the Sun, whose visible body is called a Maya, a reflection, just asman's body is. \"The real Sun and the real Moon are as invisible as the real man,\" says an occult maxim.And it may be remarked en passant that those ancients were not so foolish after all who first started the idea of \"the seven moons.\" Forthough------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 180 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.this conception is now taken solely as an astronomical measure of time, in a very materialised form, yet underlying the husk there canstill be recognised the traces of a profoundly philosophical idea.In reality the Moon is only the satellite of the Earth in one respect, viz., that physically the Moon revolves round the Earth. But inevery other respect it is the Earth which is the satellite of the Moon, and not vice versa. Startling as the statement may seem it is notwithout confirmation from scientific knowledge. It is evidenced by the tides, by the cyclic changes in many forms of disease whichcoincide with the lunar phases; it can be traced in the growth of plants, and is very marked in the phenomena of human gestation andconception. The importance of the Moon and its influence on the Earth were recognized in every ancient religion, notably theJewish, and have been remarked by many observers of psychical and physical phenomena. But, so far as Science knows, the Earth'saction on the Moon is confined to the physical attraction, which causes her to circle in her orbit. And should an objector insist that thisfact alone is sufficient evidence that the Moon is truly the Earth's satellite on other planes of action, one may reply by asking whethera mother, who walks round and round her child's cradle keeping watch over the infant, is the subordinate of her child or dependentupon it; though in one sense she is its satellite, yet she is certainly older and more fully developed than the child she watches.It is, then, the Moon that plays the largest and most important part, as well in the formation of the Earth itself, as in the peoplingthereof with human beings. The \"Lunar Monads\" or Pitris, the ancestors of man, become in reality man himself. They are the\"Monads\" who enter on the cycle of evolution on Globe A, and who, passing round the chain of planets, evolve the human form ashas just been shown. At the beginning of the human stage of the Fourth Round on this Globe, they \"ooze out\" their astral doublesfrom the \"ape-like\" forms which they had evolved in Round III. And it is this subtle, finer form, which serves as the model round whichNature builds physical man. These \"Monads\" or \"divine sparks\" are thus the \"Lunar\" ancestors, the Pitris themselves. For these \"Lunar"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Spirits\" have to become \"Men\" in order that their \"Monads\" may reach a higher plane of activity and self-consciousness, i.e., theplane of the Manasa-Putras, those who------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 181 A TRIPLE EVOLUTION IN NATURE.endow the \"senseless\" shells, created and informed by the Pitris, with \"mind\" in the latter part of the Third Root-Race.In the same way the \"Monads\" or Egos of the men of the seventh Round of our Earth, after our own Globes A, B, C, D, et seq., partingwith their life-energy, will have informed and thereby called to life other laya-centres destined to live and act on a still higher plane ofbeing -- in the same way will the Terrene \"Ancestors\" create those who will become their superiors.It now becomes plain that there exists in Nature a triple evolutionary scheme, for the formation of the three periodical Upadhis; orrather three separate schemes of evolution, which in our system are inextricably interwoven and interblended at every point. Theseare the Monadic (or spiritual), the intellectual, and the physical evolutions. These three are the finite aspects or the reflections on thefield of Cosmic Illusion of ATMA, the seventh, the ONE REALITY.1. The Monadic is, as the name implies, concerned with the growth and development into still higher phases of activity of the Monadin conjunction with:--2. The Intellectual, represented by the Manasa-Dhyanis (the Solar Devas, or the Agnishwatta Pitris) the \"givers of intelligence andconsciousness\"* to man and:--3. The Physical, represented by the Chhayas of the lunar Pitris, round which Nature has concreted the present physical body. Thisbody serves as the vehicle for the \"growth\" (to use a misleading word) and the transformations through Manas and -- owing to theaccumulation of experiences -- of the finite into the INFINITE, of the transient into the Eternal and Absolute.Each of these three systems has its own laws, and is ruled and guided by different sets of the highest Dhyanis or \"Logoi.\" Each isrepresented in the constitution of man, the Microcosm of the great Macrocosm; and it is the union of these three streams in him whichmakes him the complex being he now is.\"Nature,\" the physical evolutionary Power, could never evolve intelligence unaided -- she can only create \"senseless forms,\" as will beseen in our \"ANTHROPOGENESIS.\" The \"Lunar Monads\" cannot progress, for they have not yet had sufficient touch with the forms[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide CONCLUSION in Part II. of this Book.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 182 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.created by \"Nature\" to allow of their accumulating experiences through its means. It is the Manasa-Dhyanis who fill up the gap, andthey represent the evolutionary power of Intelligence and Mind, the link between \"Spirit\" and \"Matter\" -- in this Round.Also it must be borne in mind that the Monads which enter upon the evolutionary cycle upon Globe A, in the first Round, are in verydifferent stages of development. Hence the matter becomes somewhat complicated. . . . Let us recapitulate.The most developed Monads (the lunar) reach the human germ-stage in the first Round; become terrestrial, though very etherealhuman beings towards the end of the Third Round, remaining on it (the globe) through the \"obscuration\" period as the seed for futuremankind in the Fourth Round, and thus become the pioneers of Humanity at the beginning of this, the Fourth Round. Others reachthe Human stage only during later Rounds, i.e., in the second, third, or first half of the Fourth Round. And finally the most retarded ofall, i.e., those still occupying animal forms after the middle turning-point of the Fourth Round -- will not become men at all during thisManwantara. They will reach to the verge of humanity only at the close of the seventh Round to be, in their turn, ushered into a newchain after pralaya -- by older pioneers, the progenitors of humanity, or the Seed-Humanity (Sishta), viz., the men who will be at thehead of all at the end of these Rounds.The student hardly needs any further explanation on the part played by the fourth Globe and the fourth Round in the scheme ofevolution.From the preceding diagrams, which are applicable, mutatis mutandis, to Rounds, Globes or Races, it will be seen that the fourthmember of a series occupies a unique position. Unlike the others, the Fourth has no \"sister\" Globe on the same plane as itself, and itthus forms the fulcrum of the \"balance\" represented by the whole chain. It is the sphere of final evolutionary adjustments, the world ofKarmic scales, the Hall of Justice, where the balance is struck which determines the future course of the Monad during the remainderof its incarnations in the cycle. And therefore it is, that, after this central turning-point has been passed in the Great Cycle, -- i.e., afterthe middle point of the Fourth Race in the Fourth Round on our Globe -- no more Monads can enter the human kingdom. The door isclosed for this Cycle and the balance struck. For were it otherwise -- had there been a new soul------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 1, Page]] 183 MAN, THE OLDEST SON OF THE EARTH.created for each of the countless milliards of human beings that have passed away, and had there been no reincarnation -- it wouldbecome difficult indeed to provide room for the disembodied \"Spirits;\" nor could the origin and cause of suffering ever be accountedfor. It is the ignorance of the occult tenets and the enforcement of false conceptions under the guise of religious education, whichhave created materialism and atheism as a protest against the asserted divine order of things.The only exceptions to the rule just stated are the \"dumb races,\" whose Monads are already within the human stage, in virtue of thefact that these \"animals\" are later than, and even half descended from man, their last descendants being the anthropoid and otherapes. These \"human presentments\" are in truth only the distorted copies of the early humanity. But this will receive full attention inthe next Book.As the Commentary, broadly rendered, says:--1. \"Every form on earth, and every speck (atom) in Space strives in its efforts towards self-formation to follow the model placed for it inthe ' HEAVENLY MAN.' . . . Its (the atom's) involution and evolution, its external and internal growth and development, have all oneand the same object -- man; man, as the highest physical and ultimate form on this earth; the MONAD, in its absolute totality andawakened condition -- as the culmination of the divine incarnations on Earth.\"2. \"The Dhyanis (Pitris) are those who have evolved their BHUTA (doubles) from themselves, which RUPA (form) has become thevehicle of monads (seventh and sixth principles) that had completed their cycle of transmigration in the three preceding Kalpas(Rounds). Then, they (the astral doubles) became the men of the first Human Race of the Round. But they were not complete, andwere senseless.\"This will be explained in the Books that follow. Meanwhile man -- or rather his Monad -- has existed on the earth from the verybeginning of this Round. But, up to our own Fifth Race, the external shapes which covered those divine astral doubles changed andconsolidated with every sub-race; the form and physical structure of the fauna changing at the same time, as they had to be adaptedto the ever-changing conditions of life on this globe during the geological periods of its formative cycle. And thus shall they go onchanging with every------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 184 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Root Race and every chief sub-race down to the last one of the Seventh in this Round.3. \"The inner, now concealed, man, was then (in the beginnings) the external man. The progeny of the Dhyanis (Pitris), he was 'theson like unto his father.' Like the lotus, whose external shape assumes gradually the form of the model within itself, so did the form ofman in the beginning evolve from within without. After the cycle in which man began to procreate his species after the fashion of thepresent animal kingdom, it became the reverse. The human foetus follows now in its transformations all the forms that the physicalframe of man had assumed throughout the three Kalpas (Rounds) during the tentative efforts at Plastic formation around the monadby senseless, because imperfect, matter, in her blind wanderings. In the present age, the physical embryo is a plant, a reptile, ananimal, before it finally becomes man, evolving within himself his own ethereal counterpart, in his turn. In the beginning it was thatcounterpart (astral man) which, being senseless, got entangled in the meshes of matter.\"But this \"man\" belongs to the fourth Round. As shown, the MONAD had passed through, journeyed and been imprisoned in, everytransitional form throughout every kingdom of nature during the three preceding Rounds. But the monad which becomes human is notthe Man. In this Round -- with the exception of the highest mammals after man, the anthropoids destined to die out in this our race,when their monads will be liberated and pass into the astral human forms (or the highest elementals) of the Sixth* and the SeventhRaces, and then into lowest human forms in the fifth Round -- no units of either of the kingdoms are animated any longer by monadsdestined to become human in their next stage, but only by the lower Elementals of their respective realms.**The last human Monad incarnated before the beginning of the 5th[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Nature never repeats herself, therefore the anthropoids of our day have not existed at any time since the middle of the Mioceneperiod; when, like all cross breeds, they began to show a tendency, more and more marked as time went on, to return to the type oftheir first parent, the black and yellow gigantic Lemuro-Atlantean. To search for the \"Missing Link\" is useless. To the scientists of theclosing sixth Root-race, millions and millions of years hence, our modern races, or rather their fossils, will appear as those of smallinsignificant apes -- an extinct species of the genus homo.** These \"Elementals\" will become human Monads, in their turn, only at the next great planetary Manvantara.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 185 THE MAN, OR THE APE; WHICH THE FIRST?Root-Race.* The cycle of metempsychosis for the human monad is closed, for we are in the Fourth Round and the Fifth Root-Race.The reader will have to bear in mind -- at any rate one who has made himself acquainted with \"Esoteric Buddhism\" -- that the Stanzas"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"which follow in this Book and Book II speak of the evolution in our Fourth Round only. The latter is the cycle of the turning-point, afterwhich, matter,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Such anthropoids form an exception because they were not intended by Nature, but are the direct product and creation of\"senseless\" man. The Hindus give a divine origin to the apes and monkeys because the men of the Third Race were gods fromanother plane who had become \"senseless\" mortals. This subject had already been touched upon in \"Isis Unveiled\" twelve years agoas plainly as was then possible. On pp. 278-279, the reader is referred \"to the Brahmins, if he would know the reason of the regardthey have for the monkeys. For then he (the reader) would perhaps learn -- were the Brahman to judge him worthy of an explanation --that the Hindu sees in the ape but what Manu desired he should: the transformation of species most directly connected with that of thehuman family, a bastard branch engrafted on their own stock before the final perfection of the latter. He might learn, further, that inthe eyes of the educated 'heathen' the spiritual or inner man is one thing, and his terrestrial physical casket another. That physicalnature, the great combination of physical correlations of forces, ever creeping onward towards perfection, has to avail herself of thematerial at hand; she models and remodels as she proceeds, and finishing her crowning work in man, presents him alone as a fittabernacle for the overshadowing of the divine Spirit.\"Moreover, a German scientific work is mentioned in a footnote on the same page. It says that a Hanoverian scientist had recentlypublished a Book entitled \"Ueber die Auflosung der Arten durch Naturliche Zucht-wahl,\" in which he shows, with great ingenuity, thatDarwin was wholly mistaken in tracing man back to the ape. On the contrary, he maintains that it is the ape which is evolved fromman. He shows that, in the beginning, mankind were morally and physically the types and prototypes of our present Race, and of ourhuman dignity, by their beauty of form, regularity of feature, cranial development, nobility of sentiments, heroic impulses, andgrandeur of ideal conception. This is a purely Brahmanic, Buddhistic and Kabalistic philosophy. The Book is copiously illustrated withdiagrams, tables, etc. It asserts that the gradual debasement and degradation of man, morally and physically, can be readily tracedthroughout the ethnological transformation down to our time. And, as one portion has already degenerated into apes, so the civilizedman of the present day will at last, under the action of the inevitable law of necessity, be also succeeded by like descendants. If wemay judge of the future by the actual Present, it certainly does seem possible that so unspiritual and materialistic a body should endas Simia rather than as Seraphs. But though the apes descend from man, it is certainly not the fact that the human Monad, which hasonce reached the level of humanity, ever incarnates again in the form of an animal.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 186 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.having reached its lowest depths, begins to strive onward and to get spiritualized with every new Race and with every fresh cycle.Therefore the student must take care not to see contradiction where there is none, as in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" Rounds are spoken of ingeneral, while here only the Fourth, or our present Round, is meant. Then it was the work of formation; now it is that of reformationand evolutionary perfection.Finally, to close this chapter anent various, but unavoidable misconceptions, we must refer to a statement in \"Esoteric Buddhism\"which has produced a very fatal impression upon the minds of many Theosophists. One unfortunate sentence from the work justreferred to is constantly brought forward to prove the materialism of the doctrine. On p. 48, 5th Edition, the Author, referring to theprogress of organisms on the Globes, says that \"the mineral kingdom will no more develop the vegetable . . . than the Earth was ableto develop man from the ape, till it received an impulse.\"Whether this sentence renders literally the thought of the author, or is simply (as we believe it is) a lapsus calami, may remain anopen question.It is really with surprise that we have ascertained the fact that \"Esoteric Buddhism\" was so little understood by some Theosophists, asto have led them into the belief that it thoroughly supported Darwinian evolution, and especially the theory of the descent of manfrom a pithecoid ancestor. As one member writes: \"I suppose you realise that three-fourths of Theosophists and even outsiders imaginethat, as far as the evolution of man is concerned, Darwinism and Theosophy kiss one another.\" Nothing of the kind was ever realised,nor is there any great warrant for it, so far as we know, in \"Esoteric Buddhism.\" It has been repeatedly stated that evolution as taughtby Manu and Kapila was the groundwork of the modern teachings, but neither Occultism nor Theosophy has ever supported the wildtheories of the present Darwinists -- least of all the descent of man from an ape. Of this, more hereafter. But one has only to turn to p.47 of \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" 5th edition, to find there the statement that \"Man belongs to a kingdom distinctly separate from that of theanimals.\" With such a plain and unequivocal statement before him, it is very strange that any careful student should have been somisled unless he is prepared to charge the author with a gross contradiction.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 187 AN ERRONEOUS OPINION.Every Round repeats on a higher scale the evolutionary work of the preceding Round. With the exception of some higher anthropoids,as just mentioned, the Monadic inflow, or inner evolution, is at an end till the next Manvantara. It can never be too often repeated,that the full-blown human Monads have to be first disposed of, before the new crop of candidates appears on this Globe at thebeginning of the next cycle. Thus there is a lull; and this is why, during the Fourth Round, man appears on Earth earlier than anyanimal creation, as will be described."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"But it is still urged that the author of \"Esoteric Buddhism\" has \"preached Darwinism\" all along. Certain passages would undoubtedlyseem to lend countenance to this inference. Besides which the Occultists themselves are ready to concede partial correctness to theDarwinian hypothesis, in later details, bye-laws of Evolution, and after the midway point of the Fourth Race. Of that which has takenplace, physical science can really know nothing, for such matters lie entirely outside of its sphere of investigation. But what theOccultists have never admitted, nor will they ever admit, is that man was an ape in this or in any other Round; or that he ever couldbe one, however much he may have been \"ape-like.\" This is vouched for by the very authority from whom the author of \"EsotericBuddhism\" got his information.Thus to those who confront the Occultists with these lines from the above-named volume: \"It is enough to show that we may asreasonably -- and that we must, if we would talk about these matters at all -- conceive a life-impulse giving birth to mineral form, as ofthe same sort of impulse concerned to raise a race of apes into a race of rudimentary men.\" To those who bring this passage forwardas showing \"decided Darwinism,\" the Occultists answer by pointing to the explanation of the Master (Mr. Sinnett's \"teacher\") whichwould contradict these lines, were they written in the spirit attributed to them. A copy of this letter was sent to the writer, together withothers, two years ago (1886), with additional marginal remarks, to quote from, in the \"Secret Doctrine.\" It begins by considering thedifficulty experienced by the Western student, in reconciling some facts, previously given, with the evolution of man from the animal,i.e., from the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, and advises the student to hold to the doctrine of analogy andcorrespondences. Then it touches upon the mystery of the Devas,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 188 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and even Gods, having to pass through states which it was agreed to refer to as \"Inmetallization, Inherbation, Inzoonization andfinally Incarnation,\" and explains this by hinting at the necessity of failures even in the ethereal races of Dhyan Chohans. Concerningthis it says:\"Still, as these 'failures' are too far progressed and spiritualized to be thrown back forcibly from Dhyan Chohanship into the vortex of anew primordial evolution through the lower kingdoms. . . . .\" After which only a hint is given about the mystery contained in theallegory of the fallen Asuras, which will be expanded and explained in Book II. When Karma has reached them at the stage of humanevolution, \"they will have to drink it to the last drop in the bitter cup of retribution. Then they become an active force and comminglewith the Elementals, the progressed entities of the pure animal kingdom, to develop little by little the full type of humanity.\"These Dhyan Chohans, as we see, do not pass through the three kingdoms as do the lower Pitris; nor do they incarnate in man untilthe Third Root Race. Thus, as the teaching stands:\"Man in the First Round and First Race on Globe D, our Earth, was an ethereal being (a Lunar Dhyani, as man), non-intelligent butsuperspiritual; and correspondingly, on the law of analogy, in the First Race of the Fourth Round. In each of the subsequent races andsub-races . . . he grows more and more into an encased or incarnate being, but still preponderatingly ethereal. . . . He is sexless, and,like the animal and vegetable he develops monstrous bodies correspondential with his coarser surroundings.\"II. Round.

For, on the downward arc, he has now reached a point where his primordial spirituality is eclipsed andovershadowed by nascent mentality (2).

All this must be taken in its relative sense. And therefore there is little to bewondered at, if, left to his own speculations, an author, however eager to learn, yet quite inexperienced in these abstruse teachings,has fallen[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Natures of the seven hierarchies or classes of Pitris and Dhyan Chohans which compose our nature and Bodies are here meant.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 190 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.into an error. Neither was the difference between the \"Rounds\" and the \"Races\" sufficiently defined in the letters received, nor wasthere anything of the kind required before, as the ordinary Eastern disciple would have found out the difference in a moment.Moreover, to quote from a letter of the Master's (188-), \"the teachings were imparted under protest. . . . They were, so to say, smuggledgoods . . . and when I remained face to face with only one correspondent, the other, Mr. . . . ., had so far tossed all the cards intoconfusion, that little remained to be said without trespassing upon law.\" Theosophists, \"whom it may concern,\" will understand what ismeant.The outcome of all this is that nothing had ever been said in the \"letters\" to warrant the assurance that the Occult doctrine has evertaught, or any Adept believed in, the preposterous modern theory of the descent of man from a common ancestor with the ape -- ananthropoid of the actual animal kind, unless metaphorically. To this day the world is more full of \"ape-like men\" than the woods are of\"men-like apes.\" The ape is sacred in India because its origin is well known to the Initiates, though concealed under a thick veil ofallegory. Hanuman is the son of Pavana (Vayu, \"the god of the wind\") by Anjana, a monster called Kesari, though his genealogyvaries. The reader who bears this in mind will find in Book II. passim, the whole explanation of this ingenious allegory. The \"Men\" ofthe Third Race (who separated) were \"Gods\" by their spirituality and purity, though senseless, and as yet destitute of mind, as men.These \"Men\" of the Third Race -- the ancestors of the Atlanteans -- were just such ape-like, intellectually senseless giants as werethose beings, who, during the Third Round, represented Humanity. Morally irresponsible, it was these third Race \"men\" who, throughpromiscuous connection with animal species lower than themselves, created that missing link which became ages later (in the tertiaryperiod only) the remote ancestor of the real ape as we find it now in the pithecoid family.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* And if this is found clashing with that other statement which shows the animal later than man, then the reader is asked to bear inmind that the placental mammal only is meant. In those days there were animals of which zoology does not even dream in our own;and the modes of reproduction were not identical with the notions which modern physiology has upon the subject. It is not altogetherconvenient to touch upon such questions in public, but there is no contradiction or impossibility in this whatever.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 191 THE PRELIMINARY CREATION OF MAN.Thus the earlier teachings, however unsatisfactory, vague and fragmentary, did not teach the evolution of \"man\" from the \"ape.\" Nordoes the author of \"Esoteric Buddhism\" assert it anywhere in his work in so many words; but, owing to his inclination towards modernscience, he uses language which might perhaps justify such an inference. The man who preceded the Fourth, the Atlantean race,however much he may have looked physically like a \"gigantic ape\" -- \"the counterfeit of man who hath not the life of a man\" -- wasstill a thinking and already a speaking man. The \"Lemuro-Atlantean\" was a highly civilized race, and if one accepts tradition, which isbetter history than the speculative fiction which now passes under that name, he was higher than we are with all our sciences and thedegraded civilization of the day: at any rate, the Lemuro-Atlantean of the closing Third Race was so.And now we may return to the Stanzas.-------STANZA VI. -- Continued.5.

And it so happens that we are in the Fourth Round, at themiddle point of which the perfect equilibrium between Spirit and Matter had to take place.* Says the Commentary explaining theverse:--\"The holy youths (the gods) refused to multiply and create species after their likeness, after their kind. They are not fit forms (rupas) forus. They have to grow. They refuse to enter the chhayas (shadows or images) of their inferiors.

THE CURSE IS PRONOUNCED (a): THEY WILL BE BORN IN THE FOURTH (Race), SUFFER AND CAUSE SUFFERING (b). THIS ISTHE FIRST WAR (c).(a) It is a universal tradition that, before the physiological \"Fall,\" propagation of one's kind, whether human or animal, took placethrough the WILL of the Creators, or of their progeny. It was the Fall of Spirit into generation, not the Fall of mortal man. It hasalready been stated that, to become a Self-Conscious Spirit, the latter must pass through every cycle of being, culminating in itshighest point on earth in Man.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It was, as we shall see, at this period -- during the highest point of civilization and knowledge, as also of human intellectuality, of thefourth, Atlantean Race -- that, owing to the final crisis of physiologico-spiritual adjustment of the races, humanity branched off into itstwo diametrically opposite paths: the RIGHT- and the LEFT-hand paths of knowledge or of Vidya. \"Thus were the germs of the Whiteand the Black Magic sown in those days. The seeds lay latent for some time, to sprout only during the early period of the Fifth (ourRace).\" (Commentary.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 193 THE FIRST CAUSE OF SIN.Spirit per se is an unconscious negative ABSTRACTION. Its purity is inherent, not acquired by merit; hence, as already shown, tobecome the highest Dhyan Chohan it is necessary for each Ego to attain to full self-consciousness as a human, i.e., conscious Being,which is synthesized for us in Man. The Jewish Kabalists arguing that no Spirit could belong to the divine hierarchy unless Ruach(Spirit) was united to Nephesh (living Soul), only repeat the Eastern Esoteric teaching. \"A Dhyani has to be an Atma-Buddhi; once theBuddhi-Manas breaks loose from its immortal Atma of which it (Buddhi) is the vehicle, Atman passes into NON-BEING, which isabsolute Being.\" This means that the purely Nirvanic state is a passage of Spirit back to the ideal abstraction of Be-ness which has norelation to the plane on which our Universe is accomplishing its cycle.(b) \"The curse is pronounced\" does not mean, in this instance, that any personal Being, god, or superior Spirit, pronounced it, butsimply that the cause which could but create bad results had been generated, and that the effects of a Karmic cause could lead the\"Beings\" that counteracted the laws of Nature, and thus impeded her legitimate progress, only to bad incarnations, hence to suffering.(c) \"There were many wars\" refers to several struggles of adjustment, spiritual, cosmical, and astronomical, but chiefly to the mystery ofthe evolution of man as he is now. Powers -- pure Essences -- \"that were told to create\" is a sentence that relates to a mysteryexplained, as already said, elsewhere. It is not only one of the most hidden secrets of Nature -- that of generation, over whose solutionthe Embryologists have vainly put their heads together -- but likewise a divine function that involves that other religious, or ratherdogmatic, mystery, the \"Fall\" of the Angels, as it is called. Satan and his rebellious host would thus prove, when the meaning of theallegory is explained, to have refused to create physical man, only to become the direct Saviours and the Creators of \"divine Man.\"The symbolical teaching is more than mystical and religious, it is purely scientific, as will be seen later on. For, instead of remaining amere blind, functioning medium, impelled and guided by fathomless LAW, the \"rebellious\" Angel claimed and enforced his right ofindependent judgment and will, his------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 194 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"right of free-agency and responsibility, since man and angel are alike under Karmic Law.*\"And there was war in Heaven. . . .

And the Dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil andSatan, which deceiveth the whole world.\"The Kabalistic version of the same story is given in the Codex Nazareus, the scripture of the Nazarenes, the real mystic Christians ofJohn the Baptist and the Initiates of Christos. Bahak-Zivo, the \"Father of the Genii,\" is ordered to construct creatures (to create). But, ashe is \"ignorant of Orcus,\" he fails to do so, and calls in Fetahil, a still purer spirit, to his aid, who fails still worse. This is a repetition ofthe failure of the \"Fathers,\" the lords of light who fail one after the other. (Book II, Sloka 17.)We will now quote from our earlier Volumes:--\"Then steps on the stage of creation the spirit** (of the Earth so-called, or the Soul, Psyche, which St. James calls 'devilish') the lowerportion the Anima Mundi or Astral Light. (See the close of this Sloka). With the Nazarenes and the Gnostics this Spirit was[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Explaining Kabalistic views, the author of the \"New Aspects of Life\" says of the Fallen Angels that, \"According to the symbolicalteaching, Spirit, from being simply a functionary agent of God, became volitional in its developed and developing action; and,substituting its own will for the Divine desire in its regard, so fell. Hence the Kingdom and reign of Spirits and spiritual action, whichflow from and are the product of Spirit-volition, are outside, and contrasted with, and in contradiction to the Kingdom of Souls andDivine action.\" So far, so good; but what does the Author mean by saying, \"When man was created, he was human in constitution,with human affections, human hopes and aspirations. From this state he fell -- into the brute and savage\"? This is diametricallyopposite to our Eastern teaching, and even to the Kabalistic notion so far as we understand it, and to the Bible itself. This looks likeCorporealism and Substantialism colouring positive philosophy, though it is rather hard to feel quite sure of the Author's meaning (seep. 235). A FALL, however, \"from the natural into the supernatural and the animal\" -- supernatural meaning the purely spiritual in thiscase -- means what we suggest.** On the authority of Irenaeus, of Justin Martyr and the \"Codex\" itself, Dunlap shows that the Nazarenes regarded \"Spirit\" as a femaleand Evil Power in its connection with our Earth.

Thus the spirit of the Earth perceiving that for Fetahil,* the newest man (the latest), the splendour was 'changed,' and thatfor splendour existed 'decrease and damage,' she awakes Karabtanos,** 'who was frantic and without sense and judgment,' and says tohim:-- 'Arise, see, the splendour (light) of the newest man (Fetahil) has failed (to produce or create men), the decrease of thissplendour is visible. Rise up, come with thy MOTHER (the Spiritus) and free thee from limits by which thou art held, and those moreample than the whole world.' After which follows the union of the frantic and blind matter, guided by the insinuations of the spirit (notthe Divine breath but the Astral spirit, which by its double essence is already tainted with matter); and the offer of the MOTHER beingaccepted, the Spiritus conceives \"Seven Figures,\" and the seven stellars (planets) which represent also the seven capital sins, theprogeny of an astral soul separated from its divine source (spirit) and matter, the blind demon of concupiscence. Seeing this, Fetahilextends his hand towards the abyss of matter, and says:-- 'Let the Earth exist, just as the abode of the powers has existed.'

It is already the outline of thetwo \"Supremes\" -- God and Satan. But in the Stanzas no such idea exists.Most of the Western Christian Kabalists -- pre-eminently Eliphas Levi -- in their desire to reconcile the Occult Sciences with Churchdogmas, did their best to make of the \"Astral Light\" only and preeminently the Pleroma of early Church Fathers, the abode of theHosts of the Fallen Angels, of the \"Archons\" and \"Powers.\" But the Astral Light, while only the lower aspect of the Absolute, is yetdual. It is the Anima Mundi, and ought never to be viewed otherwise, except for Kabalistic purposes. The difference which existsbetween its \"light\" and its \"Living Fire\" ought to be ever present in the mind of the Seer and the \"Psychic.\" The higher aspect, withoutwhich only creatures of matter from that Astral Light can be produced, is this Living Fire, and it is the Seventh Principle. It is said in\"Isis Unveiled,\" in a complete description of it:--\"The Astral Light or Anima Mundi is dual and bisexual. The (ideal) male part of it is purely divine and spiritual, it is the Wisdom, it isSpirit or Purusha; while the female portion (the Spiritus of the Nazarenes) is tainted, in one sense, with matter, is indeed matter, andtherefore is evil already. It is the life-principle of every living creature, and furnishes the astral soul, the fluidic perisprit, to men,animals, fowls of the air, and everything living. Animals have only the latent germ of the highest immortal soul in them. . . . .

Book I.) If one studies the Comments attentively he will find the same progression inthe angelic natures, viz., from the passive down to the active, the last of these Beings being as near to the Ahamkara element (theregion or plane wherein Egoship or the feeling of I-am-ness is beginning to be defined) as the first ones are near to theundifferentiated essence. The former are Arupa, incorporeal; the latter, Rupa, corporeal.In Volume II. of Isis (p. 183 et seq.) the philosophical systems of the Gnostics and the primitive Jewish Christians, the Nazarenes andthe Ebionites, are fully considered. They show the views held in those days -- outside the circle of Mosaic Jews -- about Jehovah. Hewas identified by all the Gnostics with the evil, rather than with the good principle. For them, he was Ilda-Baoth, \"the son of Darkness,\"whose mother, Sophia Achamoth, was the daughter of Sophia, the Divine Wisdom (the female Holy Ghost of the early Christians) --Akasa;** while Sophia Achamoth personified the lower Astral Light or Ether.

(See Isis, Vol. II. p. 186.) Thisconnects the \"Stellar\" and \"Lunar\" Spirits with the higher planetary Angels and the Saptarishis (the seven Rishis of the Stars) of theHindus -- as subordinate Angels (Messengers) to these \"Rishis,\" the emanations, on the descending scale, of the former. Such, in theopinion of the philosophical Gnostics, were the God and the Archangels now worshipped by the Christians! The \"Fallen Angels\" andthe legend of the \"War in Heaven\" is thus purely pagan in its origin and comes from India via Persia and Chaldea. The only referenceto it in the Christian canon is found in Revelations xii., as quoted a few pages back.Thus \"SATAN,\" once he ceases to be viewed in the superstitious, dogmatic, unphilosophical spirit of the Churches, grows into thegrandiose image of one who made of terrestrial a divine MAN; who gave him, throughout the long cycle of Maha-kalpa the law of theSpirit of Life, and made him free from the Sin of Ignorance, hence of death.

Therein will be found the very history of the evolution of thosecountless Globes which evolve after a periodical Pralaya, rebuilt from old material into new forms. The previous Globes disintegrateand reappear transformed and perfected for a new phase of life. In the Kabala, worlds are compared to sparks which fly from under thehammer of the great Architect -- LAW, the law which rules all the smaller Creators.The following comparative diagram shows the identity between the two systems, the Kabalistic and the Eastern. The three upper arethe three higher planes of consciousness, revealed and explained in both schools only to the Initiates, the lower ones represent thefour lower planes -- the lowest being our plane, or the visible Universe.These seven planes correspond to the seven states of consciousness in man.

We rejoice to hear it, for ours is an Occult teaching lost in the darkness of archaic ages. We havetreated of it fully in \"Isis Unveiled,\" and the idea of Darwinian-like evolution, of struggle for life and supremacy, and of the \"survival ofthe fittest\" among the Hosts above as the Hosts below, runs throughout both the volumes of our earlier work, written in 1876 (SeeIndex in \"Isis Unveiled\" at the words \"Evolution\" -- \"Darwin\" -- \"Kapila\" -- \"Battle of Life,\" etc. etc.) But the idea was not ours, it is thatof antiquity. Even the Puranic writers have ingeniously interwoven allegory with Cosmic facts and human events. Any symbologistmay discern the astro-cosmical allusion even though he be unable to grasp the whole meaning. The great \"Wars in Heaven,\" in thePuranas; the wars of the Titans, in Hesiod and other classical writers; the \"struggles,\" also in the Egyptian legend between Osiris andTyphon, and even those in the Scandinavian legends, all refer to the same subject. Northern Mythology refers to it as the battle of theFlames, the sons of Muspel who fought on the field of Wigred. All these relate to Heaven and Earth, and have a double and ofteneven a triple meaning, and esoteric application to things above as to things below. They relate severally to astronomical, theogonicaland human struggles; to the adjustment of orbs, and the supremacy among nations and tribes. The \"Struggle for Existence\" and the\"Survival of the Fittest\" reigned supreme from the moment that Kosmos manifested into being, and could hardly escape the observanteye of the ancient Sages. Hence the incessant fights of Indra, the god of the Firmament, with the Asuras -- degraded from high godsinto Cosmic demons; and with Vritri or Ah-hi; the battles fought between stars and constellations, between Moon and planets -- lateron incarnated as kings and mortals. Hence also the War in Heaven of Michael and his Host against the Dragon (Jupiter and Lucifer-Venus), when a third of the stars of the rebellious host was hurled down into Space, and \"its place was found no more in Heaven.\" Assaid long ago -- \"This is the basic and fundamental stone of the secret cycles.

There were old worlds that perished conquered by the new,\" etc., etc. (\"Isis Unveiled,\" Vol. II., p. 260.) Theassertion that all the worlds (Stars, planets, etc.) -- as soon as a nucleus of primordial substance in the laya (undifferentiated) state isinformed by the freed principles, of a just deceased sidereal body -- become first comets, and then Suns to cool down to inhabitableworlds, is a teaching as old as the Rishis.Thus the Secret Books distinctly teach, as we see, an astronomy that would not be rejected even by modern speculation could thelatter thoroughly understand its teachings.For, archaic astronomy, and the ancient, physical and mathematical sciences, expressed views identical with those of modern science,and many of far more momentous import. A \"struggle for life\" as a \"survival of the fittest\" in the worlds above, as on our planet herebelow, are distinctly taught. This teaching, however, although it would not be \"entirely rejected\" by Science, is sure to be repudiatedas an integral whole. For it avers that there are only seven Self-born primordial \"gods\" emanated from the trinitarian ONE. In otherwords, it means that all the worlds or sidereal bodies (always on strict analogy) are formed one from the other, after the primordialmanifestation at the beginning of the \"Great Age\" is accomplished. The birth of the celestial bodies in Space is compared to a crowdor multitude of \"pilgrims\" at the festival of the \"Fires.\" Seven ascetics appear on the threshold of the temple with seven lighted sticksof incense. At the light of these the first row of pilgrims light their incense sticks. After which every ascetic begins whirling his stickaround his head in space, and furnishes the rest with fire. Thus with the heavenly bodies. A laya-centre is lighted and awakened intolife by the fires of another \"pilgrim,\" after which the new \"centre\" rushes into space and becomes a comet. It is only after losing itsvelocity, and hence its fiery tail, that the \"Fiery Dragon\" settles down into quiet and steady life as a regular respectable citizen of thesidereal family. Therefore it is said:--Born in the unfathomable depths of Space, out of the homogeneous Element called the World-Soul, every nucleus of Cosmic matter,suddenly launched into being, begins life under the most hostile circumstances.

It circles round and round between denser and already fixed bodies, moving by jerks, and pullingtowards some given point or centre that attracts it, trying to avoid, like a ship drawn into a channel dotted with reefs and sunken rocks,other bodies that draw and repel it in turn; many perish, their mass disintegrating through stronger masses, and, when born within asystem, chiefly within the insatiable stomachs of various Suns. (See Comm. to Stanza IV). Those which move slower and arepropelled into an elliptic course are doomed to annihilation sooner or later. Others moving in parabolic curves generally escapedestruction, owing to their velocity.Some very critical readers will perhaps imagine that this teaching, as to the cometary stage passed through by all heavenly bodies, isin contradiction with the statements just made as to the moon being the mother of the earth. They will perhaps fancy that intuition isneeded to harmonize the two. But no intuition is in truth required. What does Science know of Comets, their genesis, growth, andultimate behaviour? Nothing -- absolutely nothing! And what is there so impossible that a laya centre -- a lump of cosmic protoplasm,homogeneous and latent, when suddenly animated or fired up -- should rush from its bed in Space and whirl throughout the abysmaldepths in order to strengthen its homogeneous organism by an accumulation and addition of differentiated elements? And whyshould not such a comet settle in life, live, and become an inhabited globe!\"The abodes of Fohat are many,\" it is said. \"He places his four fiery (electro-positive) Sons in the \"Four circles\"; these Circles are theEquator, the Ecliptic, and the two parallels of declination, or the tropics -- to preside over the climates of which are placed the Fourmystical Entities. Then again: \"Other seven (sons) are commissioned to preside over the seven hot, and seven cold lokas (the hells ofthe orthodox Brahmins) at the two ends of the Egg of Matter (our Earth and its poles). The seven lokas are also called the \"Rings,\"elsewhere, and the \"Circles.\" The ancients made the polar circles seven instead of two, as Europeans do; for Mount Meru, which is theNorth Pole, is said to have seven gold and seven silver steps leading to it.The strange statement made in one of the Stanzas: \"The Songs of Fohat and his Sons were radiant as the noon-tide Sun and theMoon combined;\" and that the four Sons on the middle four-fold------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 205 SEEING SOUND, HEARING COLOURS.Circle \"saw their father's songs and heard his Solar-selenic radiance;\" is explained in the Commentary in these words: \"The agitationof the Fohatic Forces at the two cold ends (North and South Poles) of the Earth which resulted in a multicoloured radiance at night,have in them several of the properties of Akasa (Ether) colour and sound as well.\" . . . . . . \"Sound is the characteristic of Akasa (Ether):it generates air, the property of which is Touch; which (by friction) becomes productive of Colour and Light.\" . . . . . .

The two poles are said tobe the store-houses, the receptacles and liberators, at the same time, of Cosmic and terrestrial Vitality (Electricity); from the surplus ofwhich the Earth, had it not been for these two natural \"safety-valves,\" would have been rent to pieces long ago. At the same time it isnow a theory that has lately become an axiom, that the phenomenon of polar lights is accompanied by, and productive of, strongsounds, like whistling, hissing, and cracking.

We know that by \"Eternity\" the seventh part of311,040,000,000,000 years, or an age of Brahma is meant. But what of that? We also know that, to begin with, if we take for our basisthe above figures, we have first of all to eliminate from the 100 years of Brahma (or 311,040,000,000,000 years) two years taken up bythe Sandhyas (twilights), which leaves 98, as we have to bring it to the mystical combination 14 x 7. But we have no knowledge atwhat time precisely the evolution and formation of our little earth began. Therefore it is impossible to calculate its age, unless the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"time of its birth is given -- which the TEACHERS refuse to do, so far. At the close of this Book and in Book II., however, somechronological hints will be given. We must remember, moreover, that the law of Analogy holds good for the worlds, as it does for man;and that as \"The ONE (Deity) becomes Two (Deva or Angel) and Two becomes Three (or man),\" etc., etc., so we are taught that theCurds (world-stuff) become wanderers, (Comets), these become stars, and the stars (the centres of vortices) our sun and planets -- to putit briefly.*(b) There are four grades of initiation mentioned in exoteric works, which are known respectively in Sanskrit as \"Srotapanna,\"\"Sagardagan,\" \"Anagamin,\" and \"Arhan\" -- the four paths to Nirvana, in this, our fourth Round, bearing the same appellations. TheArhan, though he can see the Past, the Present, and the Future, is not yet the highest Initiate; for the Adept himself, the initiatedcandidate, becomes chela (pupil) to a higher Initiate. Three further higher grades have to be conquered by the Arhan who wouldreach the apex of the ladder of Arhatship.

Thus there willalways be Initiates and the Profane till the end of this minor Manvantara, the present life-cycle. The Arhats of the \"fire-mist\" of the 7thrung are but one remove from the Root-Base of their Hierarchy -- the highest on Earth, and our Terrestrial chain. This \"Root-Base\" hasa name which can only be translated by several compound words into English\" -- \"the ever-living-human-Banyan.\" This \"WondrousBeing\" descended from a \"high region,\" they say, in the early part of the Third Age, before the separation of the sexes of the ThirdRace.This Third Race is sometimes called collectively \"the Sons of Passive Yoga,\" i.e., it was produced unconsciously by the second Race,which, as it was intellectually inactive, is supposed to have been constantly plunged in a kind of blank or abstract contemplation, asrequired by the conditions of the Yoga state. In the first or earlier portion of the existence of this third race, while it was yet in its stateof purity, the \"Sons of Wisdom,\" who, as will be seen, incarnated in this Third Race, produced by Kriyasakti a progeny called the\"Sons of Ad\" or \"of the Fire-Mist,\" the \"Sons of Will and Yoga,\" etc. They were a conscious production, as a portion of the race wasalready animated with the divine spark of spiritual, superior intelligence. It was not a Race, this progeny. It was at first a wondrousBeing, called the \"Initiator,\" and after him a group of semi-divine and semi-human beings. \"Set apart\" in Archaic genesis for certainpurposes, they are those in whom are said to have incarnated the highest Dhyanis, \"Munis and Rishis from previous Manvantaras\" -- toform the nursery for future human adepts, on this earth and during the present cycle. These \"Sons of Will and Yoga\" born, so to speak,in an immaculate way, remained, it is explained, entirely apart from the rest of mankind.The \"BEING\" just referred to, which has to remain nameless, is the Tree from which, in subsequent ages, all the great historicallyknown Sages and Hierophants, such as the Rishi Kapila, Hermes, Enoch, Orpheus, etc., etc., have branched off. As objective man, heis the mysterious (to the profane -- the ever invisible) yet ever present Personage about whom legends are rife in the East, especiallyamong the Occultists and the students of the Sacred Science. It is he who changes form, yet remains ever the same. And it is heagain who holds spiritual sway over the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 208 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.initiated Adepts throughout the whole world. He is, as said, the \"Nameless One\" who has so many names, and yet whose names andwhose very nature are unknown. He is the \"Initiator,\" called the \"GREAT SACRIFICE.\" For, sitting at the threshold of LIGHT, he looksinto it from within the circle of Darkness, which he will not cross; nor will he quit his post till the last day of this life-cycle. Why does thesolitary Watcher remain at his self-chosen post? Why does he sit by the fountain of primeval Wisdom, of which he drinks no longer, ashe has naught to learn which he does not know -- aye, neither on this Earth, nor in its heaven? Because the lonely, sore-footedpilgrims on their way back to their home are never sure to the last moment of not losing their way in this limitless desert of illusion andmatter called Earth-Life. Because he would fain show the way to that region of freedom and light, from which he is a voluntary exilehimself, to every prisoner who has succeeded in liberating himself from the bonds of flesh and illusion. Because, in short, he hassacrificed himself for the sake of mankind, though but a few Elect may profit by the GREAT SACRIFICE.It is under the direct, silent guidance of this MAHA -- (great) -- GURU that all the other less divine Teachers and instructors of mankindbecame, from the first awakening of human consciousness, the guides of early Humanity. It is through these \"Sons of God\" that infanthumanity got its first notions of all the arts and sciences, as well as of spiritual knowledge; and it is they who have laid the firstfoundation-stone of those ancient civilizations that puzzle so sorely our modern generation of students and scholars.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"* Let those who doubt this statement explain the mystery of the extraordinary knowledge possessed by the ancients -- alleged to havedeveloped from lower and animal-like savages, the cave-men of the Palaeolithic age -- on any other equally reasonable grounds. Letthem turn to such works as those of Vitruvius Pollio of the Augustan age, on architecture, for instance, in which all the rules ofproportion are those taught anciently at initiations, if he would acquaint himself with the truly divine art, and understand the deepesoteric significance hidden in every rule and law of proportion. No man descended from a Palaeolithic cave-dweller could everevolve such a science unaided, even in millenniums of thought and intellectual evolution. It is the pupils of those incarnated Rishisand Devas of the third Root Race, who handed their knowledge from one generation to another, to Egypt and Greece with its now lostcanon of proportion; as it is the Disciples of the Initiates of the 4th, the Atlanteans, who handed it over to their Cyclopes, the \"Sons ofCycles\" or of the \"Infinite,\" from whom the name passed to the still later generations of Gnostic priests. \"It is owing to the divineperfection [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 209 THE SACRED ISLAND.Although these matters were barely hinted at in \"Isis Unveiled,\" it will be well to remind the reader of what was said in Vol. I., pp. 587to 593, concerning a certain Sacred Island in Central Asia, and to refer him for further details to the chapter in Book II. on \"The Sonsof God and the Sacred Island.\" A few more explanations, however, though thrown out in a fragmentary form, may help the student toobtain a glimpse into the present mystery.To state at least one detail concerning these mysterious \"Sons of God\" in plain words. It is from them, these Brahmaputras, that thehigh Dwijas, the initiated Brahmins of old justly claimed descent, while the modern Brahmin would have the lowest castes believeliterally that they issued direct from the mouth of Brahma. This is the esoteric teaching, which adds moreover that, although thesedescendants (spiritually of course) from the \"sons of Will and Yoga,\" became in time divided into opposite sexes, as their \"Kriyasakti\"progenitors did themselves, later on; yet even their degenerate descendants have down to the present day retained a veneration andrespect for the creative[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] of those architectural proportions that the Ancients could build those wonders of all thesubsequent ages, their Fanes, Pyramids, Cave-Temples, Cromlechs, Cairns, Altars, proving they had the powers of machinery and aknowledge of mechanics to which modern skill is like a child's play, and which that skill refers to itself as the 'works of hundred-handedgiants.'\" (See \"Book of God,\" Kenealy.) Modern architects may not altogether have neglected those rules, but they have superaddedenough empirical innovations to destroy those just proportions. It is Vitruvius who gave to posterity the rules of construction of theGrecian temples erected to the immortal gods; and the ten books of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio on Architecture, of one, in short, who wasan initiate, can only be studied esoterically. The Druidical circles, the Dolmen, the Temples of India, Egypt and Greece, the Towersand the 127 towns in Europe which were found \"Cyclopean in origin\" by the French Institute, are all the work of initiated Priest-Architects, the descendants of those primarily taught by the \"Sons of God,\" justly called \"The Builders.\" This is what appreciativeposterity says of those descendants. \"They used neither mortar nor cement, nor steel nor iron to cut the stones with; and yet they wereso artfully wrought that in many places the joints are not seen, though many of the stones, as in Peru, are 18 ft. thick, and in the wallsof the fortress of Cuzco there are stones of a still greater size.\" (Acosta, vi., 14.) \"Again, the walls of Syene, built 5,400 years ago,when that spot was exactly under the tropic, which it has now ceased to be, were so constructed that at noon, at the precise moment ofthe solar solstice, the entire disc of the Sun was seen reflected on their surface -- a work which the united skill of all the astronomers ofEurope would not now be able to effect.\" -- (Kenealy, \"Book of God.\")------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 210 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.function, and still regard it in the light of a religious ceremony, whereas the more civilized nations consider it as a mere animalfunction. Compare the western views and practice in these matters with the Institutions of Manu in regard to the laws of Grihasta andmarried life. The true Brahmin is thus indeed \"he whose seven forefathers have drunk the juice of the moon-plant (Soma),\" and who isa \"Trisuparna,\" for he has understood the secret of the Vedas.And, to this day, such Brahmins know that, during its early beginnings, psychic and physical intellect being dormant andconsciousness still undeveloped, the spiritual conceptions of that race were quite unconnected with its physical surroundings. Thatdivine man dwelt in his animal -- though externally human -- form; and, if there was instinct in him, no self-consciousness came toenlighten the darkness of the latent fifth principle. When, moved by the law of Evolution, the Lords of Wisdom infused into him thespark of consciousness, the first feeling it awoke to life and activity was a sense of solidarity, of one-ness with his spiritual creators. Asthe child's first feeling is for its mother and nurse, so the first aspirations of the awakening consciousness in primitive man were forthose whose element he felt within himself, and who yet were outside, and independent of him. DEVOTION arose out of that feeling,and became the first and foremost motor in his nature; for it is the only one which is natural in our heart, which is innate in us, andwhich we find alike in human babe and the young of the animal. This feeling of irrepressible, instinctive aspiration in primitive man isbeautifully, and one may say intuitionally, described by Carlyle. \"The great antique heart,\" he exclaims, \"how like a child's in itssimplicity, like a man's in its earnest solemnity and depth! heaven lies over him wheresoever he goes or stands on the earth; makingall the earth a mystic temple to him, the earth's business all a kind of worship.

As time rolled on the holy caste of Initiates produced but rarely, and fromage to age, such perfect creatures: beings apart, inwardly, though the same as those who produced them, outwardly.While in the infancy of the third primitive race:--\"A creature of a more exalted kindWas wanting yet, and therefore was designed;Conscious of thought, of more capacious breastFor empire formed and fit to rule the rest. . . . .\"It was called into being, a ready and perfect vehicle for the incarnating denizens of higher spheres, who took forthwith their abodes inthese forms born of Spiritual WILL and the natural divine power in man. It was a child of pure Spirit, mentally unalloyed with anytincture of earthly element. Its physical frame alone was of time and of life, as it drew its intelligence direct from above. It was theliving tree of divine wisdom; and may therefore be likened to the Mundane Tree of the Norse Legend, which cannot wither and dieuntil the last battle of life shall be fought, while its roots are gnawed all the time by the dragon Nidhogg; for even so, the first and holySon of Kriyasakti had his body gnawed by the tooth of time, but the roots of his inner being remained for ever undecaying and strong,because they grew and expanded in heaven not on earth. He was the first of the FIRST, and he was the seed of all the others. Therewere other \"Sons of Kriyasakti\" produced by a second Spiritual effort, but the first one has remained to this day the Seed of divineKnowledge, the One and the Supreme among the terrestrial \"Sons of Wisdom.\" Of this subject we can say no more, except to add thatin every age -- aye, even in our own -- there have been great intellects who have understood the problem correctly.How comes our physical body to the state of perfection it is found in now? Through millions of years of evolution, of course, yet neverthrough, or from, animals, as taught by materialism. For, as Carlyle says:-- \". . . The essence of our being, the mystery in us that callsitself 'I,' -- what words have we for such things? -- it is a breath of Heaven,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 212 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the highest Being reveals himself in man. This body, these faculties, this life of ours, is it not all as a vesture for the UNNAMED?\"The breath of heaven, or rather the breath of life, called in the Bible Nephesh, is in every animal, in every animate speck as in everymineral atom. But none of these has, like man, the consciousness of the nature of that highest Being,* as none has that divineharmony in its form which man possesses. It is, as Novalis said, and no one since has said it better, as repeated by Carlyle:--\"There is but one temple in the universe, and that is the body of man. Nothing is holier than that high form . . . . We touch heavenwhen we lay our hand on a human body!\" \"This sounds like a mere flourish of rhetoric,\" adds Carlyle, \"but it is not so. If wellmeditated it will turn out to be a scientific fact; the expression . . . of the actual truth of the thing.

All this is subdivided intonumberless groups of divine Spiritual, semi-Spiritual, and ethereal Beings.The Chief Hierarchies among these are hinted at in the great Quaternary, or the \"four bodies and the three faculties\" of Brahmaexoterically, and the Panchasyam, the five Brahmas, or the five Dhyani-Buddhas in the Buddhist system.The highest group is composed of the divine Flames, so-called, also spoken of as the \"Fiery Lions\" and the \"Lions of Life,\" whoseesotericism is securely hidden in the Zodiacal sign of Leo. It is the nucleole of the superior divine World (see Commentary in firstpages of Addendum). They are the formless Fiery Breaths, identical in one aspect with the upper Sephirothal TRIAD, which is placedby the Kabalists in the \"Archetypal World.\"The same hierarchy, with the same numbers, is found in the Japanese system, in the \"Beginnings\" as taught by both the Shinto andthe Buddhist sects. In this system, Anthropogenesis precedes Cosmogenesis, as the Divine merges into the human, and creates --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This relates to the Cosmic principles.** The seven creative Rishis now connected with the constellation of the Great Bear------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 214 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.midway in its descent into matter -- the visible Universe. The legendary personages -- remarks reverentially Omoie -- \"having to beunderstood as the stereotyped embodiment of the higher (secret) doctrine, and its sublime truths.\" To state it at full length, however,would occupy too much of our space, but a few words on this old system cannot be out of place. The following is a short synopsis ofthis Anthropo-Cosmogenesis, and it shows how closely the most separated notions echoed one and the same Archaic teaching.When all was as yet Chaos (Kon-ton) three spiritual Beings appeared on the stage of future creation: (1) Ame no ani naka nushi noKami, \"Divine Monarch of the Central Heaven\"; (2) Taka mi onosubi no Kami, \"Exalted, imperial Divine offspring of Heaven and theEarth\"; and (3) Kamu mi musubi no Kami, \"Offspring of the Gods,\" simply.These were without form or substance (our arupa triad), as neither the celestial nor the terrestrial substance had yet differentiated, \"norhad the essence of things been formed.\"In the Zohar -- which, as now arranged and re-edited by Moses de Leon, with the help of Syrian and Chaldean Christian Gnostics inthe XIIth century, and corrected and revised still later by many Christian hands, is only a little less exoteric than the Bible itself -- thisdivine \"Vehicle\" no longer appears as it does in the \"Chaldean Book of Numbers.\" True enough, Ain-Soph, the ABSOLUTEENDLESS NO-THING, uses also the form of the ONE, the manifested \"Heavenly man\" (the FIRST CAUSE) as its chariot (Mercabah, inHebrew; Vahan, in Sanskrit) or vehicle to descend into, and manifest through, in the phenomenal world. But the Kabalists neithermake it plain how the ABSOLUTE can use anything, or exercise any attribute whatever, since, as the Absolute, it is devoid ofattributes; nor do they explain that in reality it is the First Cause (Plato's Logos) the original and eternal IDEA, that manifests throughAdam Kadmon, the Second Logos, so to speak. In the \"Book of Numbers\" it is explained that EN (or Ain, Aior) is the only self-existent,whereas its \"Depth\" (Bythos or Buthon of the Gnostics, called Propator) is only periodical. The latter is Brahm as differentiated fromBrahma or Parabrahm. It is the Depth, the Source of Light, or Propator, which is the unmanifested Logos or the abstract Idea, and notAin-Soph, whose ray uses Adam-Kadmon or the manifested Logos (the objective Universe) \"male and female\" -- as a chariot throughwhich to manifest. But in the Zohar we read the following incongruity: \"Senior------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 215 ONE PARENT FLAME, COUNTLESS FLAMES.occultatus est et absconditus; Microprosopus manifestus est, et non manifestus.\" (Rosenroth; Liber Mysterii, IV., 1.) This is a fallacy,since Microprosopus or the microcosm, can only exist during its manifestations, and is destroyed during the Maha-Pralayas.Rosenroth's Kabala is no guide, but very often a puzzle.(b) As in the Japanese system, in the Egyptian, and every old cosmogony -- at this divine FLAME, The \"One,\" are lit the threedescending groups. Having their potential being in the higher group, they now become distinct and separate Entities. These arecalled the \"Virgins of Life,\" the \"Great Illusion,\" etc., etc., and collectively the \"Six-pointed Star.\" The latter is the symbol, in almostevery religion, of the Logos as the first emanation. It is that of Vishnu in India (the Chakra, or wheel), and the glyph of theTetragrammaton, the \"He of the four letters\" or -- metaphorically -- \"the limbs of Microprosopos\" in the Kabala, which are ten and sixrespectively. The later Kabalists however, especially the Christian mystics, have played sad havoc with this magnificent symbol.* Forthe \"ten limbs\" of the Heavenly Man are the ten Sephiroth; but the first Heavenly Man is the unmanifested Spirit of the Universe, andought never to be degraded into Microprosopus -- the lesser Face or Countenance, the prototype of man on the terrestrial plane.** Of"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"this, however, later on.

This fact cannot be too frequentlyimpressed upon the reader.** The Microprosopus is, as just said, the Logos manifested, and of such there are many.*** Sephira is the Crown, KETHER, in the abstract principle only, as a mathematical x (the unknown quantity). On the plane ofdifferentiated nature she is the female counterpart of Adam Kadmon -- the first Androgyne. The Kabala teaches that the word \"FiatLux\" (Genesis ch. i.) referred to the formation and evolution of the Sephiroth, and not to light as opposed to darkness.

In its Unity, primordial light is the seventh, or highest, principle, Daivi-prakriti, the light of the unmanifestedLogos. But in its differentiation it becomes Fohat, or the \"Seven Sons.\" The former is symbolised by the Central point in the double-Triangle; the latter by the hexagon itself, or the \"six limbs\" of the Microprosopus the Seventh being Malkuth, the \"Bride\" of theChristian Kabalists, or our Earth. Hence the expressions:\"The first after the 'One' is divine Fire; the second, Fire and AEther; the third is composed of Fire, AEther and Water; the fourth of Fire,AEther, Water, and Air.\"* The One is not concerned with Man-bearing globes, but with the inner invisible Spheres. \"The 'First-Born'are the LIFE, the heart and pulse of the Universe; the Second are its MIND or Consciousness,\"**as said in the Commentary.(c) The second Order of Celestial Beings, those of Fire and AEther (corresponding to Spirit and Soul, or the Atma-Buddhi) whosenames are legion, are still formless, but more definitely \"substantial.\" They are the first differentiation in the Secondary Evolution or\"Creation\" -- a misleading word. As the name shows, they are the prototypes of the incarnating Jivas or Monads, and are composed ofthe Fiery Spirit of Life. It is through these that passes, like a pure solar beam, the ray which is furnished by them with its future vehicle,the Divine Soul, Buddhi. These are directly concerned with the Hosts of the higher world of our system. From these twofold Unitsemanate the threefold.In the cosmogony of Japan, when, out of the chaotic mass, an egglike nucleus appears, having within itself the germ and potency ofall the universal as well as of all terrestrial life, it is the \"three-fold\" just named, which differentiates. \"The male aethereal\" (Yo)principle[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] panions, companions, man as an emanation was both man and woman, Adam Kadmonverily, and this is the sense of the words 'Let there be Light, and it was Light.'

From this the female, the mother, the first rudimentary objective being is born. It is ethereal,without form or sex, and yet it is from this and the mother that the Seven Divine Spirits are born, from whom will emanate the sevencreations, just as in the Codex Nazaraeus from Karabtanos and the Mother Spiritus the seven evilly disposed (material) spirits are born.It would be too long to give here the Japanese names, but once translated they stand in this order:--(1.)

As seen above, the very first group of the Rupa Angels is quaternary, an element being added toeach in descending order.

Then follow the septenary groupsor hosts. Placed on parallel lines in a diagram with Atoms, the Natures of those Beings would be seen to correspond in their downwardscale of progression to composite elements in a mathematically identical manner, as to analogy. This refers, of course, only todiagrams made by the Occultists; for were the scale of Angelic Beings to be placed on a parallel line with the scale of the chemicalatoms of Science -- from the hypothetical Helium down to Uranium -- they would of course be found to differ. For these have, ascorrespondents on the Astral plane, only the four lowest orders -- the higher three principles in the atom, or rather molecule orchemical element, being perceptible only to the initiated Dangma's eye. But then, if Chemistry desired to find itself on the right path,it would have to correct its tabular arrangement by that of the Occultists -- which it may refuse to do. In Esoteric Philosophy, everyphysical particle corresponds to and depends on its higher noumenon -- the Being to whose essence it belongs; and above as below,the Spiritual evolves from the Divine, the psycho-mental from the Spiritual -- tainted from its lower plane by the astral -- the wholeanimate and (seemingly) inanimate Nature evolving on parallel lines, and drawing its attributes from above as well as from below.** The number seven does not imply only seven Entities, but seven groups or Hosts, as explained before.

For the latter are the field wherein lies concealed in its privation the germ that will fall into generation. That germwill become the spiritual potency in the physical cell that guides the development of the embryo, and which is the cause of thehereditary transmission of faculties and all the inherent qualities in man. The Darwinian theory, however, of the transmission ofacquired faculties, is neither taught nor accepted in Occultism. Evolution, in it, proceeds on quite other lines; the physical, accordingto esoteric teaching, evolving gradually from the spiritual, mental, and psychic. This inner soul of the physical cell -- this \"spiritualplasm\" that dominates the germinal plasm -- is the key that must open one day the gates of the terra incognita of the Biologist, nowcalled the dark mystery of Embryology.

I am merged in Sekten.\"This last sentence gives the corroboration of, and repeats the doctrine of, esoteric Buddhism, for it alludes directly to the fifth principle(Manas), or the most spiritual part of its essence rather, which merges into, is absorbed by, and made one with Atma-Buddhi after thedeath of man. For Se-khen is the residence or loka of the god Khem (Horus-Osiris, or Father and Son), hence the \"Devachan\" of Atma-Buddhi. In the Ritual of the Dead the defunct is shown entering into Sekhem with Horus-Thot and \"emerging from it as pure spirit\"(lxiv., 29). Thus the defunct says (v. 130): \"I see the forms of (myself, as various) men transforming eternally . . . I know this (chapter).He who knows it . . . takes all kinds of living forms.\" . . .And in verse 35, addressing in magic formula that which is called, in Egyptian esotericism, the \"ancestral heart,\" or the re-incarnatingprinciple, the permanent EGO, the defunct says:--\"Oh my heart, my ancestral heart necessary for my transformations, . . . . . . do not separate thyself from me before the guardian of theScales. Thou art my personality within my breast, divine companion watching over my fleshes (bodies). . . . . . .\"It is in Sekhem that lies concealed \"the Mysterious Face,\" or the real man concealed under the false personality, the triple-crocodileof Egypt, the symbol of the higher Trinity or human Triad, Atma, Buddhi and Manas.* In all the ancient papyri the crocodile is calledSebek (Seventh), while the water is the fifth principle esoterically; and, as already stated, Mr. Gerald Massey shows that the crocodilewas \"the Seventh Soul, the supreme one of seven -- the Seer unseen.\" Even exoterically Sekhem is the residence of the god Khem,and Khem is Horus avenging the death of his father Osiris, hence punishing the Sins of man when he becomes a disembodied Soul.Thus the defunct[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* One of the explanations of the real though hidden meaning of this Egyptian religious glyph is easy. The crocodile is the first toawait and meet the devouring fires of the morning sun, and very soon came to personify the solar heat.

When askedhow that can be? How is it possible to conceive that those \"gods,\" or angels, can be at the same time their own emanations and theirpersonal selves? Is it in the same sense in the material world, where the son is (in one way) his father, being his blood, the bone of hisbone and the flesh of his flesh?

Before resorting to it, however, I would ask whether it seems unnatural,least of all \"supernatural,\" to any one of us, when we consider that process known as the growth and development of a foetus into ahealthy baby weighing several pounds evolves from what? From the segmentation of an infinitesimally small ovum and aspermatozoon; and afterwards we see that baby develop into a six-foot man!

Science has provided for all this; and, I dare say, her theories, embryological, biological, and physiological, are correctenough so far as exact observation of the material goes. Nevertheless, the two chief difficulties of the science of embryology --namely, what are the forces at work in the formation of the foetus, and the cause of \"hereditary transmission\" of likeness, physical,moral or mental -- have never been properly answered; nor will they ever be solved till the day when scientists condescend to acceptthe Occult theories.* But if this physical pheno-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The materialists and the evolutionists of the Darwinian school would be ill-advised to accept the newly worked-out theories ofProfessor Weissmann, the author of Beitrage zur Descendenzlehre, with regard to one of the two mysteries of Embryology, as abovespecified, which he seems to have solved -- as he thinks. For, when it is solved, Science will have stepped over into the domain of thetruly occult, and stepped for ever out of the realm of transformation, as taught by Darwin. The two are irreconcileable, from thestandpoint of materialism. Regarded from that of the Occultists, it solves all these mysteries. Those who are not acquainted with thenew discovery of Professor Weissman -- at one time a fervent Darwinist -- ought to hasten to repair the deficiency. The GermanEmbryologist-philosopher shows -- thus stepping over the heads of the Greek Hippocrates and Aristotle, right back into the teachings ofthe old Aryans -- one infinitesimal cell, out of millions of others at work in the formation of an organism, determining alone and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"unaided, by means of constant segmentation and multiplication, the correct image of the future man (or animal) in its physical,mental, and psychic characteristics. It is that cell which impresses on the face and form of the new individual the features of theparents or of some distant ancestor; it is that cell again which transmits to him the intellectual and mental idiosyncracies of his sires,and so on. This Plasm is the immortal portion of our bodies -- simply through the process of successive assimilations. Darwin's theory,viewing the embryological cell as an essence or the extract from all other cells, is set aside; it is incapable of accounting for hereditarytransmission. There are but two ways of explaining the mystery of heredity; either the substance of the germinal cell is endowed withthe faculty of crossing the whole cycle of transformations that lead to the construction of a separate organism and then to thereproduction of identical germinal cells; or, those germinal cells do not have their genesis at all in the body of the individual, butproceed directly from the ancestral germinal cell passed from father to son through long generations. It is the latter hypothesis thatWeissmann accepted and has worked upon; and it is to this cell that he traces the immortal portion of man. So far, so good; and whenthis almost correct theory is accepted, how will Biologists explain the first appearance of this everlasting cell? Unless man \"grew\" likethe \"immortal Topsy,\" and was not born at all, but fell from the clouds, how was that embryological cell born in him?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 224 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.menon astonishes no one, except in so far as it puzzles the Embryologists, why should our intellectual and inner growth, the evolutionof the human-spiritual to the Divine-Spiritual, be regarded as, or seem, more impossible than the other? Now to the simile.Complete the physical plasm, mentioned in the last foot-note, the \"Germinal Cell\" of man with all its material potentialities, with the\"spiritual plasm,\" so to say, or the fluid that contains the five lower principles of the six-principled Dhyan -- and you have the secret, ifyou are spiritual enough to understand it.\"When the seed of the animal man is cast into the soil of the animal woman, that seed cannot germinate unless it has been fructifiedby the five virtues (the fluid of, or the emanation from the principles) of the six-fold Heavenly man. Wherefore the Microcosm isrepresented as a Pentagon, within the Hexagon Star, the \"Macrocosm.\" (\"[[Anthropos]],\") a work on Occult Embryology, Book I.). Then:\"The functions of Jiva on this Earth are of a five-fold character. In the mineral atom it is connected with the lowest principles of theSpirits of the Earth (the six-fold Dhyanis); in the vegetable particle, with their second -- the Prana (life); in the animal, with all theseplus the third and the fourth; in man, the germ must receive the fruition of all the five. Otherwise he will be born no higher than ananimal\"; namely, a congenital idiot. Thus in man alone the Jiva is complete. As to his seventh principle, it is but one of the Beams ofthe Universal Sun. Each rational creature receives only the temporary loan of that which has to return to its source; while his physicalbody is shaped by the lowest terrestrial lives, through physical, chemical, and physiological evolution. \"The Blessed Ones havenought to do with the purgations of matter.\" (Kabala, Chaldean Book of Numbers).It comes to this: Mankind in its first prototypal, shadowy form, is the offspring of the Elohim of Life (or Pitris); in its qualitative andphysical aspect it is the direct progeny of the \"Ancestors,\" the lowest Dhyanis, or Spirits of the Earth; for its moral, psychic, and spiritualnature, it is indebted to a group of divine Beings, the name and characteristics of which will be given in Book II. Collectively, men arethe handiwork of hosts of various spirits; distributively, the tabernacles of those hosts; and occasionally and singly, the vehicles of someof them. In our present all-material Fifth Race, the earthly Spirit of the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 225 SPIRIT FALLING INTO MATTER.Fourth is still strong in us; but we are approaching the time when the pendulum of evolution will direct its swing decidedly upwards,bringing Humanity back on a parallel line with the primitive third Root-Race in Spirituality. During its childhood, mankind wascomposed wholly of that Angelic Host, who were the indwelling Spirits that animated the monstrous and gigantic tabernacles of clayof the Fourth Race built by (as they are now also) and composed of countless myriads of lives.* This sentence will be explained lateron in the present Commentary. The \"tabernacles\" have improved in texture and symmetry of form, growing and developing with theglobe that bore them; but the physical improvement took place at the expense of the spiritual inner man and nature. The threemiddle principles in earth and man became with every race more material; the Soul stepping back to make room for the physicalintellect; the essence of elements becoming the material and composite elements now known.Man is not, nor could he ever be, the complete product of the \"Lord God\"; but he is the child of the Elohim, so arbitrarily changedinto the singular masculine gender. The first Dhyanis, commissioned to \"create\" man in their image, could only throw off theirshadows, like a delicate model for the Nature Spirits of matter to work upon. (See Book II.) Man is, beyond any doubt, formedphysically out of the dust of the Earth, but his creators and fashioners were many. Nor can it be said that the \"Lord God breathed intohis nostrils the breath of life,\" unless that God is identified with the \"ONE LIFE,\" Omnipresent though invisible, and unless the sameoperation is attributed to \"God\" on behalf of every living Soul -- or Nephesch, which is the vital Soul, not the divine Spirit or Ruach,which ensures to man alone a divine degree of immortality, that no animal, as such, could ever attain in this cycle of incarnation. It isthe inadequate distinctions made by the Jews, and now by our Western metaphysicians, who, not knowing of, and being unable tounderstand, hence to accept, more than a triune man -- Spirit, Soul,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Science, dimly perceiving the truth, may find Bacteria and other infinitesimals in the human body, and see in them but occasionaland abnormal visitors to which diseases are attributed.

III. in the Fourth Gospel, have entirely perverted the meaning. Indeed the verse is made to say \"The windbloweth where it listeth,\" instead of \"the Spirit goeth where it willeth,\" as in the original and also in the translation of the GreekEastern Church.Thus the philosophy of psychic, spiritual, and mental relations with man's physical functions is in almost inextricable confusion.Neither the old Aryan, nor the Egyptian psychology are now properly understood. Nor can they be assimilated without accepting theesoteric septenary, or, at any rate, the Vedantic quinquepartite division of the human inner principles. Failing which, it will be for everimpossible to understand the metaphysical and purely psychic and even physiological relations between the Dhyan-Chohans, orAngels, on the one plane, and humanity on the other. No Eastern (Aryan) esoteric works are so far published, but we possess theEgyptian papyri which speak clearly[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The learned and very philosophical author of \"New Aspects of Life\" would impress upon his reader that the Nephesh chaiah (livingsoul), according to the Hebrews, \"proceeded from, or was produced by, the infusion of the Spirit or Breath of Life into the quickeningbody of man, and was to supersede and take the place of that spirit in the thus constituted self, so that the spirit passed into, was lostsight of, and disappeared in the living Soul.\" The human body, he thinks, ought to be viewed as a matrix in which, and from which,the Soul (which he seems to place higher than the spirit) is developed -- considered functionally and from the standpoint of activity,the Soul stands undeniably higher in this finite and conditioned world of Maya -- the Soul, he says, \"is ultimately produced from theanimated body of man.\" Thus the author identifies \"Spirit\" (Atma) simply with \"the breath of life.\" The Eastern Occultists will demur tothis statement, for it is based on the erroneous conception that Prana and Atma or Jivatma are one and the same thing. The authorsupports the argument by showing that with the ancient Hebrews, Greeks and even Latins, Ruach, Pneuma and Spiritus -- with theJews undeniably, and with the Greeks and Romans very probably -- meant Wind; the Greek word Anemos (wind) and the Latin Anima\"Soul\" having a suspicious relation.This is very far fetched. A legitimate battle-field for deciding this question is hardly to be found, since Mr. Pratt seems to be apractical, matter-of-fact metaphysician, a kind of Kabalist-Positivist, and the Eastern metaphysicians, especially the Vedantins, are allIdealists. The Occultists are also of the extreme esoteric Vedantin school, and they call the One Life (Parabrahm), the Great Breathand the Whirlwind; but they disconnect the seventh principle entirely from matter or any relation to, or connection with it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 227 THE EGYPTIAN SYSTEM.of the seven principles or the \"Seven Souls of Man.\"* The Book of the Dead gives a complete list of the \"transformations\" that everydefunct undergoes, while divesting himself, one by one, of all those principles -- materialised for the sake of clearness into etherealentities or bodies. We must, moreover, remind those who try to prove that the ancient Egyptians knew nothing of and did not teachReincarnation, that the \"Soul\" (the Ego or Self) of the defunct is said to be living in Eternity: it is immortal, \"co-eval with, anddisappearing with the Solar boat,\" i.e., for the cycle of necessity. This \"Soul\" emerges from the Tiaou (the realm of the cause of life)and joins the living on Earth by day, to return to Tiaou every night. This expresses the periodical existences of the Ego. (Book of theDead, cvxliii.)The shadow, the astral form, is annihilated, \"devoured by the Uraeus\" (cxlix., 51), the Manes will be annihilated; the two twins (the 4thand 5th principles) will be scattered; but the Soul-bird, \"the divine Swallow -- and the Uraeus of Flame\" (Manas and Atma-Buddhi) willlive in the eternity, for they are their mother's husbands.**Like alone produces like. The Earth gives Man his body, the gods (Dhyanis) his five inner principles, the psychic Shadow, of whichthose gods are often the animating principle. SPIRIT (Atman) is one -- and indiscrete. It is not in the Tiaou.For what is the Tiaou? The frequent allusion to it in the \"Book of the Dead\" contains a mystery. Tiaou is the path of the Night Sun,the inferior hemisphere, or the infernal region of the Egyptians, placed by them on the concealed side of the moon. The humanbeing, in their[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide in Part II., Book II., \"The Seven Souls of Man,\" the divisions made respectively by Messrs.

The former call the Pitris \"the lunarancestors\" of men; and the Egyptians made of the Moon-God, Taht-Esmun, the first human ancestor. This \"moon-god\" \"expressed theSeven nature-powers that were prior to himself, and were summed up in him as his seven souls, of which he was the manifestor as theeighth one (hence the eighth sphere).

Thus the defunct is shown arriving in the West,receiving his judgment before Osiris, resurrecting as the god Horus, and circling round the sidereal heavens, which is an allegoricalassimilation to Ra, the Sun; then having crossed the Noot (the celestial abyss), returning once more to Tiaou: an assimilation to Osiris,who, as the God of life and reproduction, inhabits the moon. Plutarch (Isis and Osiris, ch. xliii.) shows the Egyptians celebrating afestival called \"The Ingress of Osiris into the moon.\" In chapter xli. life is promised after death; and the renovation of life is placedunder the patronage of Osiris-Lunus, because the moon was the symbol of life-renewals or reincarnations, owing to its growth, waning,dying, and reappearance every month. In the Dankmoe, (iv. 5) it is said:-- \"Oh, Osiris-Lunus! That renews to thee thy renewal.\" AndSafekh says to Seti I. (Mariette's Abydos, plate 51), \"Thou renewest thyself as the god Lunus when a babe.\" It is still better explainedin a Louvre papyrus (P. Pierret, \"Etudes Egyptologiques\"): \"Couplings and conceptions abound when he (Osiris-Lunus) is seen inheaven on that day.\" Says Osiris: \"Oh, sole radiant beam of the moon! I issue from the circulating multitudes (of stars) . . . . . . Openme the Tiaou, for Osiris N. I will issue by day to do what I have to do amongst the living\" (\"Book of the Dead,\" ch. ii.), -- i.e., toproduce conceptions.Osiris was \"God manifest in generation,\" because the ancients knew, far better than the moderns, the real occult influences of thelunar body upon the mysteries of conception.* Later on, when the moon became connected with female goddesses** -- with Diana,Isis, Artemis,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the oldest systems we find the Moon always male.

For itis the Moon and her [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 229 MANY STREAMS, BUT ONE SOURCE.Juno, etc., that connection was due to a thorough knowledge of physiology and female nature, physical as much as psychic. But,primarily, the Sun and Moon were the only visible and, so to say, tangible [by their effects] psychic and physiological deities -- theFather and the Son, while Space and air in general, or that expanse of Heaven called Noot by the Egyptians, was the concealedSpirit or Breath of the two. These \"Father and Son\" were interchangeable in their functions and worked harmoniously together in theireffects upon terrestrial nature and humanity; hence they were regarded as ONE, though TWO in personified Entities. They were bothmales, and both had their distinct and also collaborative work in the causative generation of Humanity. So much from theastronomical and cosmic standpoints viewed and expressed in symbolical language -- which became in our last races theological anddogmatic. But behind this veil of Cosmic and Astrological symbols, there were the Occult mysteries of Anthropography and theprimeval genesis of man. And in this, no knowledge of symbols -- or even the key to the post-diluvian symbolical language of the Jews-- will, or can help, save only with reference to that which was laid down in national scriptures for exoteric uses; the sum of which,however cleverly veiled, was only the smallest portion of the real primitive history of each people, often relating, moreover, -- as in theHebrew Scriptures -- merely to the terrestrial human, not divine life of that nation. That psychic and spiritual element belonged toMYSTERY and INITIATION. There were things never recorded in scrolls, but, as in Central Asia, on rocks and in subterranean crypts.Nevertheless, there was a time when the whole world was \"of one lip and of one knowledge,\" and Man knew more of his origin thanhe does now, and thus knew that the Sun and Moon, however large a part they do play in the constitution, growth and developmentof the human body, were not the direct causative agents of his appearance on Earth;[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] conjunctions that regulate conceptions, and every astrologer in India knows it. During theprevious and the present races, at least at the beginning of this one, those who indulged in marital relations during certain lunarphases that made those relations sterile were regarded as sorcerers and sinners. But even now those sins of old, based on the Occultknowledge and the abuse of it, would appear preferable to the crimes of to-day, which are perpetrated because of the completeignorance of, and disbelief in all such occult influences.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 230 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.these agents being, in truth, the living and intelligent Powers which the Occultists call Dhyan Chohans."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"As to this, a very learned admirer of the Jewish Esotericism tells us that \"the Kabala says expressly that Elohim is a 'generalabstraction'; what we call in mathematics 'a constant co-efficient' or a 'general function' entering into all construction, not particular;that is, by the general ratio 1 to 31415, (the astro-Dhyanic and) Elohistic figures.\" To this the Eastern Occultist replies: Quite so, it isan abstraction to our physical senses. To our spiritual perceptions, however, and to our inner spiritual eye, the Elohim or Dhyanis areno more an abstraction than our soul and spirit are to us. Reject the one and you reject the other -- since that which is the survivingEntity in us is partly the direct emanation from, and partly those celestial Entities themselves. One thing is sure; the Jews wereperfectly acquainted with sorcery and various maleficent forces; but, with the exception of some of their great prophets and seers likeDaniel and Ezekiel (Enoch belonging to a far distant race and not to any nation but to all, as a generic character), they knew little of,nor would they deal with, the real divine Occultism, their national character being averse to anything which had no direct bearingupon their own ethnical, tribal, and individual benefits -- witness their own prophets, and the curses thundered by them against the\"stiff-necked race.\" But even the Kabala plainly shows the direct relation between the Sephiroth, or Elohim, and men.Therefore, when it is proved to us that the Kabalistic identification of Jehovah with Binah, a female Sephiroth, has still another, asub-occult meaning in it, then and then only the Occultist will be ready to pass the palm of perfection to the Kabalist. Until then, it isasserted that, as Jehovah is in the abstract sense of a \"one living God,\" a single number, a metaphysical figment, and a reality onlywhen put in his proper place as an emanation and a Sephiroth -- we have a right to maintain that the Zohar (as witnessed by theBOOK OF NUMBERS, at any rate), gave out originally, before the Christian Kabalists had disfigured it, and still gives out the samedoctrine that we do; i.e., it makes Man emanate, not from one Celestial MAN, but from a Septenary group of Celestial men or Angels,just as in \"Pymander, the Thought Divine.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 231 THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE \"ONE.\"STANZA VII. -- Continued.(3) WHEN THE ONE BECOMES TWO -- THE \"THREE-FOLD\" APPEARS (a).

The Egyptian Ra, issuing from the DEEP, is the Divine Universal Soul in its manifested aspect, and so is Narayana, thePurusha, \"concealed in Akasa and present in Ether.\"This is the metaphysical explanation, and refers to the very beginning of Evolution, or, as we should rather say, of Theogony. Themeaning of the Stanza when explained from another standpoint in its reference to the mystery of man and his origin, is still moredifficult to comprehend. In order to form a clear conception of what is meant by the One becoming two, and then being transformedinto the \"three-fold,\" the student has to make himself thoroughly acquainted with what we call \"Rounds.\" If he refers to \"EsotericBuddhism\" -- the first attempt to sketch out an approximate outline of archaic Cosmogony -- he will find that by a \"Round\" is meantthe serial evolution of nascent material nature, of the seven globes of our chain* with their mineral,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Several inimical critics are anxious to prove that no seven principles of man nor septenary constitution of our chain were taught inour earlier volume, \"Isis Unveiled.\" Though in that work the doctrine could only be hinted at, there are many passages, nevertheless,in which the septenary constitution of both man and chain is openly mentioned. Speaking of the Elohim in Vol. II., page 420, it issaid: \"They remain over the seventh heaven (or spiritual world), for it is they who, according to the Kabalists, formed in succession thesix material worlds, or rather, attempts at worlds that preceded our own, which, they say, is the seventh.\" Our globe is, of course, uponthe diagram representing the \"chain,\" the seventh and the lowest; though, [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 232 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.vegetable, and animal kingdoms (man being there included in the latter and standing at the head of it) during the whole period of alife-cycle. The latter would be called by the Brahmins \"a Day of Brahma.\" It is, in short, one revolution of the \"Wheel\" (our planetarychain), which is composed of seven globes (or seven separate \"Wheels,\" in another sense this time). When evolution has rundownward into matter, from planet A to planet G, or Z, as the Western students call it, it is one Round. In the middle of the Fourthrevolution, which is our present \"Round\": \"Evolution has reached its acme of physical development, crowned its work with the perfectphysical man, and, from this point, begins its work spirit-ward.\" All this needs little repetition, as it is well explained in \"EsotericBuddhism.\" That which was hardly touched upon, and of which the little that was said has misled many, is the origin of man, and it isupon this that a little more light may now be thrown, just enough to make the Stanza more comprehensible, as the process will befully explained only in its legitimate place, in Book II.Now every \"Round\" (on the descending scale) is but a repetition in a more concrete form of the Round which preceded it, as everyglobe -- down to our fourth sphere (the actual earth) -- is a grosser and more material copy of the more shadowy sphere which"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"precedes it in their successive order, on the three higher planes. (See diagram in Stanza VI. Comm. 6). On its way upwards on theascending arc, Evolution spiritualises and etherealises, so to speak, the general nature of all, bringing it on to a level with the planeon which the twin globe on the opposite side is placed; the result being, that when the seventh globe is reached (in whatever Round)the nature of everything that is evolving returns to the condition it was in at its starting point -- plus, every time, a new and superiordegree in the states of consciousness. Thus it becomes clear that the \"origin of man,\" so-called, on this our present[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] as the evolution on these globes is cyclic, it is the fourth in descending the arc of matter.And again, on page 367, Vol. II., it is written: \"In the Egyptian notions, as in those of all other faiths founded on philosophy, man wasnot merely . . . an union of soul and body; he was a trinity when spirit was added to it; and besides that doctrine made him consist ofbody, astral form, or shadow, the animal soul, the higher soul, and terrestrial intelligence and a sixth principle, etc., etc. -- the seventh-- SPIRIT.\" So clearly are these principles mentioned, that even in the Index, one finds on page 683:-- \"Six principles of man\" -- theseventh being the synthesis of the six, and not a principle but a ray of the Absolute ALL -- in strict truth.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 233 WHAT INCARNATES IN ANIMAL MAN.Round, or life-cycle on this planet, must occupy the same place in the same order -- save details based on local conditions and time --as in the preceding Round. Again, it must be explained and remembered that, as the work of each Round is said to be apportioned toa different group of so-called \"Creators\" or \"Architects,\" so is that of every globe; i.e., it is under the supervision and guidance ofspecial \"Builders\" and \"Watchers\" -- the various Dhyan-Chohans.The group of the hierarchy which is commissioned to \"create\"* men is a special group, then; yet it evolved shadowy man in this cyclejust as a higher and still more spiritual group evolved him in the Third Round. But as it is the Sixth -- on the downward scale ofSpirituality -- the last and seventh being the terrestrial Spirits (elementals) which gradually form, build, and condense his physicalbody -- this Sixth group evolves no more than the future man's shadowy form, a filmy, hardly visible transparent copy of themselves. Itbecomes the task of the fifth Hierarchy -- the mysterious beings that preside over the constellation Capricornus, Makara, or \"Crocodile\"in India as in Egypt -- to inform the empty and ethereal animal form and make of it the Rational Man. This is one of those subjectsupon which very little may be said to the general public. It is a MYSTERY, truly, but only to him who is prepared to reject theexistence of intellectual and conscious spiritual Beings in the Universe, limiting full Consciousness to man alone, and that only as a\"function of the Brain.\" Many are those among the Spiritual Entities, who have incarnated bodily in man, since the beginning of hisappearance, and who, for all that, still exist as independently as they did before, in the infinitudes of Space. . . .To put it more clearly: the invisible Entity may be bodily present on earth without abandoning, however, its status and functions in thesupersensuous regions. If this needs explanation, we can do no better than remind the reader of like cases in Spiritualism, thoughsuch cases are very rare, at least as regards the nature of the Entity incarnating,**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Creation is an incorrect word to use, as no religion, not even the sect of the Visishta Adwaitees in India -- one whichanthropomorphises even Parabrahmam -- believes in creation out of nihil as Christians and Jews do, but in evolution out ofpreexisting materials.** The so-called \"Spirits\" that may occasionally possess themselves of the bodies of mediums are not the Monads or Higher Principlesof disembodied personalities. Such a \"Spirit\" can only be either an Elementary, or -- a Nirmanakaya.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 234 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.or taking temporary possession of a medium. Just as certain persons -- men and women, reverting to parallel cases among livingpersons -- whether by virtue of a peculiar organization, or through the power of acquired mystic knowledge, can be seen in their\"double\" in one place, while the body is many miles away; so the same thing can occur in the case of superior Beings.Man, philosophically considered, is, in his outward form, simply an animal, hardly more perfect than his pithecoid-like ancestor of thethird round. He is a living body, not a living being, since the realisation of existence, the \"Ego-Sum,\" necessitates self-consciousness,and an animal can only have direct consciousness, or instinct. This was so well understood by the Ancients that the Kabalist evenmade of soul and body two lives, independent of each other.* The soul, whose body vehicle is the Astral, ethero-substantial envelope,could die and man be still living on earth -- i.e., the soul could free itself from and quit the tabernacle for various reasons -- such asinsanity, spiritual and physical depravity, etc.** Therefore, that which living men (Initiates)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* On p. 340-351 (Genesis of the Soul) in the \"New Aspects of Life,\" the Author states the Kabalistic teaching: \"They held that,functionally, Spirit and Matter of corresponding opacity and density tended to coalesce; and that the resultant created Spirits, in thedisembodied state, were constituted on a scale in which the differing opacities and transparencies of Elemental or uncreated Spiritwere reproduced. And that these Spirits in the disembodied state attracted, appropriated, digested and assimilated Elemental Spiritand Elemental Matter whose condition was conformed to their own.\" \"They therefore taught that there was a wide difference in the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"condition of created Spirits; and that in the intimate association between the Spirit-world and the world of Matter, the more opaqueSpirits in the disembodied state were drawn towards the more dense parts of the material world, and therefore tended towards thecentre of the Earth, where they found the conditions most suited to their state; while the more transparent Spirits passed into thesurrounding aura of the planet, the most rarified finding their home in its satellite.\"This relates exclusively to our Elementary Spirits, and has naught to do with either the Planetary, Sidereal, Cosmic or Inter-EthericIntelligent Forces or \"Angels\" as they are termed by the Roman Church. The Jewish Kabalists, especially the practical Occultists whodealt with ceremonial magic, busied themselves solely with the spirits of the Planets and the \"Elementals\" so-called. Therefore thiscovers only a portion of the Esoteric Teaching.** The possibility of the \"Soul\" (i.e., the eternal Spiritual Ego) dwelling in the unseen worlds, while its body goes on living on Earth, isa pre-eminently occult doctrine, especially in Chinese and Buddhist philosophy. See \"Isis Unveiled,\" vol. i., [[Footnote continued onnext page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 235 DII SUNT DEMONES INVERSI.can do, the Dhyanis, who have no physical body to hamper them, can do still better. This was the belief of the Antediluvians, and it isfast becoming that of modern intellectual society, in Spiritualism, besides the Greek and Roman Churches, which teach the ubiquityof their angels. The Zoroastrians regarded their Amshaspends as dual entities (Ferouers), applying this duality -- in esotericphilosophy, at any rate -- to all the spiritual and invisible denizens of the numberless worlds in space which are visible to our eye. In anote of Damascius (sixth century) on the Chaldean oracles, we have a triple evidence of the universality of this doctrine, for he says:\"In these oracles the seven Cosmocratores of the world, ('The World-Pillars,') mentioned likewise by St. Paul, are double -- one setbeing commissioned to rule the superior worlds the spiritual and the sidereal, and the other to guide and watch over the worlds ofmatter.\" Such is also the opinion of Jamblichus, who makes an evident distinction between the archangels and the \"Archontes.\" (See\"De Mysteriis,\" sec. ii., ch. 3.) The above may be applied, of course, to the distinction made between the degrees or orders of spiritualbeings, and it is in this sense that the Roman Catholic Church tries to interpret and teach the difference; for while the archangels arein her teaching divine and holy, their doubles are denounced by her as devils.* But the word \"ferouer\" is not to be understood in thissense, for it means simply the reverse or the opposite side of some attribute or quality. Thus when the Occultist says that the \"Demonis the lining of God\" (evil, the reverse of the medal), he does not mean two separate[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] p. 602, for an illustration. Many are the Soulless men among us, for the occurrence isfound to take place in wicked materialists as well as in persons \"who advance in holiness and never turn back.\" (See ibid and also\"Isis,\" vol. ii., p. 369.)* This identity between the Spirit and its material \"double\" (in man it is the reverse) explains still better the confusion, alluded toalready in this work, made in the names and individualities, as well as the numbers, of the Rishis and the Prajapatis; especiallybetween those of the Satyayuga and the Mahabharatan period. It also throws additional light on what the Secret Doctrine teacheswith regard to the Root and the Seed Manus (see Book ii. \"On the primitive Manus of humanity\"). Not only those progenitors of ourmankind, but every human being, we are taught, has its prototype in the Spiritual Spheres; which prototype is the highest essence ofhis seventh principle. Thus the seven Manus become 14, the Root Manu being the Prime Cause, and the \"Seed-Manu\" its effect; andwhen the latter reach from Satyayuga (the first stage) to the heroic period, these Manus or Rishis become 21 in number.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 236 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.actualities, but the two aspects or facets of the same Unity. Now the best man living would appear, side by side with an Archangel -- asdescribed in Theology -- a fiend. Hence a certain reason to depreciate a lower \"double,\" immersed far deeper in matter than itsoriginal. But there is still as little cause to regard them as devils, and this is precisely what the Roman Catholics maintain against allreason and logic.(b) The concluding sentence of this sloka shows how archaic is the belief and the doctrine that man is seven-fold in his constitution.The thread of being which animates man and passes through all his personalities, or rebirths on this Earth (an allusion to Sutratma),the thread on which moreover all his \"Spirits\" are strung -- is spun from the essence of the \"threefold,\" the \"fourfold\" and the \"fivefold\";which contain all the preceding. Panchasikha, agreeably to Bhagavata Purana (V. XX. 25-28), is one of the seven Kumaras who go toSveta-Dvipa to worship Vishnu. We shall see further on, what connection there is between the \"celibate\" and chaste sons of Brahma,who refuse \"to multiply,\" and terrestrial mortals. Meanwhile it is evident that \"the Man-Plant,\" Saptaparna, thus refers to the sevenprinciples, and man is compared to the seven-leaved plant of this name* so sacred among Buddhists.For further details as to Saptaparna and the importance of the number seven in occultism, as well as in symbology, the reader isreferred to Part II., Book II., on Symbolism: Sections on \"Saptaparna,\" \"The Septenary in the Vedas,\" etc. etc.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Egyptian allegory in the \"Book of the Dead\" already mentioned, the hymn that relates to the reward \"of the Soul,\" is assuggestive of our Septenary Doctrine as it is poetical.

In the case of the last-mentioned, the Kabalistic worksoffer abundant proof of this statement. The entire system of the Kabalistic numerals is based on the divine septenary hanging fromthe Triad (thus forming the Decade) and its permutations 7, 5, 4, and 3, which, finally, all merge into the ONE itself: an endless andboundless Circle.\"The Deity (the ever Invisible Presence),\" says the Zohar, \"manifests itself through the ten Sephiroth which are its radiating witnesses.The Deity is like the Sea from which outflows a stream called WISDOM, the waters of which fall into a lake named Intelligence. Fromthe basin, like seven channels, issue the Seven Sephiroth. . . . . For ten equal seven: the Decade contains four Unities and threeBinaries.\" The ten Sephiroth correspond to the limbs of MAN. \"When I framed Adam Kadmon,\" the Elohim are made to say, \"theSpirit of the Eternal shot out of his Body like a sheet of lightning that radiated at once on the billows of the Seven millions of skies,and my ten splendours were his limbs.\" But neither the Head nor the shoulders of Adam-Kadmon can be seen; therefore we read inthe Sephra Dzenioutha (the \"Book of the Concealed Mystery\"):--\"In the beginning of Time, after the Elohim (the \"Sons of Light and Life,\" or the \"Builders\") had shaped out of the eternal Essence theHeavens and the Earth, they formed the worlds six by six, the seventh being Malkuth, which is our Earth (see Mantuan Codex) on itsplane, and the lowest on all the other planes of conscious existence. The Chaldean Book of Numbers contains a detailed explanationof all this. \"The first triad of the body of Adam Kadmon (the three upper planes of the seven*) cannot be seen before the soul standsin the presence of the Ancient of Days.\" The Sephiroth of this upper triad are:-- \"1, Kether (the Crown) represented by the brow ofMacroprosopos; 2, Chochmah (Wisdom, a male Principle) by his right shoulder; and 3, Binah (Intelligence, a female Principle) by theleft shoulder.\" Then come the seven limbs (or Sephiroth) on the planes of manifestation, the totality of these four planes beingrepresented by Microprosopus (the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The formation of the \"living Soul\" or man, would render the idea more clearly. \"A Living Soul\" is a synonym of man in the Bible.These are our seven \"Principles.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 240 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.lesser Face) or Tetragrammaton, the \"four-lettered\" Mystery. \"The seven manifested and the three concealed limbs are the Body ofthe Deity.\"Thus our Earth, Malkuth, is both the Seventh and the Fourth world, the former when counting from the first globe above, the latter ifreckoned by the planes. It is generated by the sixth globe or Sephiroth called Yezod, \"foundation,\" or as said in the Book of Numbers\"by Yezod, He (Adam Kadmon) fecundates the primitive Heva\" (Eve or our Earth). Rendered in mystic language this is theexplanation why Malkuth, called \"the inferior Mother,\" Matrona, Queen, and the Kingdom of the Foundation, is shown as the Bride ofTetragrammaton or Microprosopus (the 2nd Logos) the Heavenly Man. When free from all impurity she will become united with theSpiritual Logos, i.e., in the 7th Race of the 7th Round -- after the regeneration, on the day of \"SABBATH.\" For the \"seventh day\" hasagain an occult significance undreamt of by our theologians.\"When Matronitha, the Mother, is separated and brought face to face with the King, in the excellence of the Sabbath, all thingsbecome one body,\" says verse 746, in chapter xxii. of \"Ha Idra Zuta Kadisha.\" \"Becomes one body\" means that all is reabsorbed oncemore into the one element, the spirits of men becoming Nirvanees and the elements of everything else becoming again what theywere before -- protyle or undifferentiated substance. \"Sabbath\" means rest or Nirvana. It is not the seventh day after six days but aperiod the duration of which equals that of the seven \"days\" or any period made up of seven parts. Thus a pralaya is equal in durationto the manwantara, or a night of Brahma is equal to this \"day.\" If the Christians will follow Jewish customs they ought to adopt thespirit and not the dead letter thereof: i.e., to work one week of seven days and rest seven days. That the word \"Sabbath\" had a mysticsignificance is shown in the contempt shown by Jesus for the Sabbath day, and by what is said in Luke xviii. 12. Sabbath is theretaken for the whole week. (See Greek text where the week is called Sabbath. \"I fast twice in the Sabbath.\") Paul, an Initiate, knew itwell when referring to the eternal rest and felicity in heaven, as Sabbath; \"and their happiness will be eternal, for they will ever be(one) with the Lord and will enjoy an eternal Sabbath.\" (Hebrew iv. 2.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 241 THE TRUE AND THE FALSE KABALA.The difference between the two systems, taking the Kabala as contained in the Chaldean Book of Numbers, not as misrepresented byits now disfigured copy, the Kabala of the Christian mystics --the Kabala and the archaic esoteric Vidya, is very small indeed, beingconfined to unimportant divergences of form and expression. Thus Eastern occultism refers to our earth as the fourth world, the lowestof the chain, above which run upward on both its sides the six globes, three on each side. The Zohar, on the other hand, calls the"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"earth the lower, or the Seventh, adding that upon the six depend all things which are in it, \"Microprosopus.\" The \"smaller face,\"smaller because manifested and finite, \"is formed of six Sephiroth,\" says the same work. \"Seven kings come and die in the thrice-destroyed world\" -- (Malkuth our earth, destroyed after each of the three rounds which it has gone through). \"And their reign (of theseven kings) will be broken up.\" (Book of Numbers, 1. viii., 3.) This relates to the Seven Races, five of which have already appeared,and two more have still to appear in this Round.The Shinto allegorical accounts of Cosmogony and the origin of man in Japan hint at the same belief.Captain C. Pfoundes studied for nearly nine years in the monasteries of Japan the religion underlying the various sects of the land. . .. . . \"The Shinto idea of creation,\" he says, \"is as follows: Out of chaos (Konton) the earth (in) was the sediment precipitated, and theHeavens (yo) the ethereal essences which ascended: Maa (jin) appeared between the two. The first man was called Kuni-to ko tatchi-no-mikoto, and five other names were given to him, and then the human race appeared, male and female. Isanagi and Isanamibegat Tenshoko doijin, the first of the five gods of the Earth.\" These \"gods\" are simply our five races, Isanagi and Isanami being thetwo kinds of the \"ancestors,\" the two preceding races which give birth to animal and to rational man.It will be shown (Vol. II. Pt. II.) that the number seven, as well as the doctrine of the septenary constitution of man, was pre-eminent inall the secret systems. It plays as important a part in Western Kabala as in Eastern Occultism. Eliphas Levi calls the number seven \"thekey to the Mosaic creation and the symbols of every religion.\" He shows the Kabala following faithfully even the septenary division ofman, as the diagram he gives in his \"Clef des Grands Mysteres\" is septenary.

One needs also only to look at the diagram (Plate VII. in Mr. Mathers' Kabala) \"the formation of the Soul\"* from the same \"Keyof the Great Mysteries\" by Levi to find the same, though with a different interpretation.Thus it stands with both the Kabalistic and the Occult names attached:--7 Neschanah [[--]] Pure Spirit [[--]] Atma6 Ruach [[--]] Spiritual Soul [[--]] Buddhi5 Nephesch [[--]] Plastic Mediator [[--]] ManasN.

The Monad or Jiva, as said in \"Isis Unveiled,\" vol. i., p. 302, is, first of all, shot down bythe law of Evolution into the lowest form of matter -- the mineral. After a sevenfold gyration encased in the stone (or that which willbecome mineral and stone in the Fourth Round), it creeps out of it, say, as a lichen.

Theyembrace a metaphysical conception of some indefinite period in the eternity, when successive attempts were being made by the lawof evolution at the formation of universes. The idea is plainly stated in the Zohar: \"There were old worlds, which perished as soon asthey came into existence, were formless, and were called Sparks. Thus, the smith, when hammering the iron, lets the sparks fly in alldirections. The sparks are the primordial worlds, which could not continue because the Sacred Aged (Sephira) had not as yet assumedits form (of androgyne, or opposite sexes) of King and Queen (Sephira and Kadmon), and the Master was not yet at his work.\" SeeZohar, \"Idra Suta,\" Book iii., p. 292, b.

All this, up to the Third Round, is formless, as matter, and senseless, as consciousness. Forthe Monad or Jiva per se cannot be even called spirit: it is a ray, a breath of the ABSOLUTE, or the Absoluteness rather, and theAbsolute Homogeneity, having no relations with the conditioned and relative finiteness, is unconscious on our plane. Therefore,besides the material which will be needed for its future human form, the monad requires (a) a spiritual model, or prototype, for thatmaterial to shape itself into; and (b) an intelligent consciousness to guide its evolution and progress, neither of which is possessed bythe homogeneous monad, or by senseless though living matter. The Adam of dust requires the Soul of Life to be breathed into him:the two middle principles, which are the sentient life of the irrational animal and the Human Soul, for the former is irrational withoutthe latter. It is only when, from a potential androgyne, man has become separated into male and female, that he will be endowedwith this conscious, rational, individual Soul, (Manas) \"the principle, or the intelligence, of the Elohim,\" to receive which, he has toeat of the fruit of Knowledge from the Tree of Good and Evil. How is he to obtain all this? The Occult doctrine teaches that while themonad is cycling on downward into matter, these very Elohim -- or Pitris, the lower Dhyan-Chohans -- are evolving pari passu with it ona higher and more spiritual plane, descending also relatively into matter on their own plane of consciousness, when, after havingreached a certain point, they will meet the incarnating senseless monad, encased in the lowest matter, and blending the twopotencies, Spirit and Matter, the union will produce that terrestrial symbol of the \"Heavenly Man\" in space -- PERFECT MAN. In theSankhya philosophy, Purusha (spirit) is spoken of as something impotent unless he mounts on the shoulders of Prakriti (matter), which,left alone, is -- senseless. But in the secret philosophy they are viewed as graduated. Though one and the same thing in their origin,Spirit and Matter, when once they are on the plane of differentiation, begin each of them their evolutionary progress in contrarydirections -- Spirit falling gradually into matter, and the latter ascending to its original condition, that of a pure spiritual substance.Both are inseparable, yet ever separated. In polarity, on the physical plane, two like poles will always repel each other, while thenegative and the positive are mutually attracted, so do Spirit and Matter stand to each other -- the two poles of the samehomogeneous substance, the root-principle of the universe.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 248 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Therefore, when the hour strikes for Purusha to mount on Prakriti's shoulders for the formation of the Perfect Man -- rudimentary manof the first 2 1/2 Races being only the first, gradually evolving into the most perfect of mammals -- the Celestial \"Ancestors\" (Entitiesfrom preceding worlds, called in India the Sishta) step in on this our plane, as the Pitris had stepped in before them for the formationof the physical or animal-man, and incarnate in the latter. Thus the two processes -- for the two creations: the animal and the divineman -- differ greatly. The Pitris shoot out from their ethereal bodies, still more ethereal and shadowy similitudes of themselves, orwhat we should now call \"doubles,\" or \"astral forms,\" in their own likeness.* This furnishes the Monad with its first dwelling, and blindmatter with a model around and upon which to build henceforth. But Man is still incomplete. From Swayambhuva Manu (in Manu,Book I.), from whom descended the seven primitive Manus or Prajapati, each of whom gave birth to a primitive race of men, down tothe Codex Nazareus, in which Karabtanos or Fetahil (blind concupiscent matter) begets on his Mother, \"Spiritus,\" seven figures, eachof which stands as the progenitor of one of the primaeval seven races -- this doctrine has left its impress on every Archaic Scripture.\"Who forms Manu (the Man) and who forms his body? The LIFE and the LIVES. Sin** and the MOON.\" Here Manu stands for thespiritual, heavenly man, the real and non-dying EGO in us, which is the direct emanation of the \"One Life\" or the Absolute Deity. Asto our outward physical bodies, the house of the tabernacle of the Soul, the Doctrine teaches a strange lesson; so strange that unlessthoroughly explained and as rightly comprehended, it is only the exact Science of the future that is destined to vindicate the theoryfully.It has been stated before now that Occultism does not accept anything inorganic in the Kosmos. The expression employed byScience, \"inorganic substance,\" means simply that the latent life slumbering in the molecules of so-called \"inert matter\" isincognizable.

That there exist in Nature Beings or Lives that can live and thrive without air, even on our globe,was demonstrated by the same men of science. Pasteur found that many of the lower lives, such as Vibriones, and some microbes andbacteria, could exist without air, which, on the contrary, killed them. They derived the oxygen necessary for their multiplication fromthe various substances that surround them. He calls them AErobes, living on the tissues of our matter when the latter has ceased toform a part of an integral and living whole (then called very unscientifically by science \"dead matter\"), and Anaerobes. The one kindbinds oxygen, and contributes vastly to the destruction of animal life and vegetable tissues, furnishing to the atmosphere materialswhich enter later on into the constitution of other organisms; the other destroys, or rather annihilates finally, the so-called organicsubstance; ultimate decay being impossible without their participation. Certain germ-cells, such as those of yeast, develop andmultiply in air, but when deprived of it, they will adapt themselves to life without air and become ferments, absorbing oxygen fromsubstances coming in contact with them, and thereby ruining the latter. The cells in fruit, when lacking free oxygen, act as fermentsand stimulate fermentation. \"Therefore the vegetable cell manifests in this case its life as an anaerobic being. Why, then, should anorganic cell form in this case an exception\"? asks Professor Bogolubof. Pasteur shows that in the substance of our tissues and organs,the cell, not finding sufficient oxygen for itself, stimulates fermentation in the same way as the fruit-cell, and Claude Bernard thoughtthat Pasteur's idea of the formation of ferments found its application and corroboration in the fact that Urea increases in the bloodduring strangulation: LIFE therefore is everywhere in the Universe, and, Occultism teaches us, it is also in the atom.

These fought, and a great heat wasdeveloped by the encountering and collision, which produced rotation. Then came the first manifested MATERIAL, Fire, the hotflames, the wanderers in heaven (comets); heat generates moist vapour; that forms solid water (?); then dry mist, then liquid mist,watery, that puts out the luminous brightness of the pilgrims (comets?) and forms solid watery wheels (MATTER globes). Bhumi (theEarth) appears with six sisters.* These produce by their continuous motion the inferior fire, heat, and an aqueous mist, which yields thethird World-Element -- WATER; and from the breath of all (atmospheric) AIR is born. These four are the four lives of the first fourperiods (Rounds) of Manvantara. The three last will follow.\"This means that every new Round develops one of the Compound Elements, as now known to Science, -- which rejects the primitivenomenclature, preferring to subdivide them into constituents. If Nature is the \"Ever-becoming\" on the manifested plane, then thoseElements are to be regarded in the same light: they have to evolve, progress, and increase to the Manvantaric end. Thus the FirstRound, we are taught, developed but one Element, and a nature and humanity in what may be called one aspect of Nature -- calledby some, very unscientifically, though it may be so de facto, \"One-dimensional Space.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is a Vedic teaching that \"there are three Earths corresponding to three Heavens, and our Earth (the fourth) is called Bhumi.\" This isthe explanation given by our exoteric Western Orientalists. But the esoteric meaning and allusion to it in the Vedas is that it refers toour planetary chain, three \"Earths\" on the descending arc, and three \"heavens\" which are the three Earths or globes also, only farmore ethereal, on the ascending or spiritual arc: by the first three we descend into matter, by the other three we ascend into Spirit; the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"lower one, Bhumi, our Earth, forming the turning point, so to say, and containing potentially as much of Spirit as it does of Matter.

The familiar phrase can only be an abbreviation ofthe fuller form -- the \"Fourth dimension of MATTER in Space.\"** But it is an unhappy phrase even thus expanded, because while it isperfectly true that the progress of evolution may be destined to introduce us to new characteristics of matter, those with which we arealready familiar are really more numerous than the three dimensions. The faculties, or what is perhaps the best available term, thecharacteristics of matter, must clearly bear a direct relation always to the senses of man. Matter has extension, colour, motion(molecular motion), taste, and smell, corresponding to the existing senses of man, and by the time that it fully develops the nextcharacteristic -- let us call it for the moment PERMEABILITY -- this will correspond to the next sense of man -- let us call it \"NORMALCLAIRVOYANCE;\" thus, when some bold thinkers have been thirsting for a fourth dimension to explain the passage of matter throughmatter, and the production of knots upon an endless cord, what they were really in want of, was a sixth characteristic of matter. Thethree dimensions belong really but to one attribute or characteristic of matter -- extension; and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Professor Zollner's theory has been more than welcomed by several Scientists --who are Spiritualists -- Professors Butlerof andWagner, of St. Petersburg, for instance.** \"The giving reality to abstractions is the error of Realism. Space and Time are frequently viewed as separated from all the concreteexperiences of the mind, instead of being generalizations of these in certain aspects.\" (Bain, Logic, Part II., p. 389.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 252 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.popular common sense justly rebels against the idea that under any condition of things there can be more than three of suchdimensions as length, breadth, and thickness. These terms, and the term \"dimension\" itself, all belong to one plane of thought, to onestage of evolution, to one characteristic of matter. So long as there are foot-rules within the resources of Kosmos, to apply to matter, solong will they be able to measure it three ways and no more; and from the time the idea of measurement first occupied a place in thehuman understanding, it has been possible to apply measurement in three directions and no more. But these considerations do notmilitate in any way against the certainty that in the progress of time -- as the faculties of humanity are multiplied -- so will thecharacteristics of matter be multiplied also. Meanwhile, the expression is far more incorrect than even the familiar one of the \"Sunrising or setting.\"We now return to the consideration of material evolution through the Rounds. Matter in the second Round, it has been stated, may befiguratively referred to as two-dimensional. But here another caveat must be entered. That loose and figurative expression may beregarded -- in one plane of thought, as we have just seen -- as equivalent to the second characteristic of matter corresponding to thesecond perceptive faculty or sense of man. But these two linked scales of evolution are concerned with the processes going on withinthe limits of a single Round. The succession of primary aspects of Nature with which the succession of Rounds is concerned, has to do,as already indicated, with the development of the \"Elements\" (in the Occult sense) -- Fire, Air, Water,* Earth. We are only in the fourthRound, and our catalogue so far stops short. The centres of consciousness (destined to develop into humanity as we know it) of thethird Round arrived at a perception of the third Element Water.** Those of the fourth Round have added[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The order in which these Elements are placed above is the correct one for esoteric purposes and in the Secret Teachings. Miltonwas right when he spoke of the \"Powers of Fire, Air, Water, Earth\"; the Earth, such as we know it now, had no existence before the 4thRound, hundreds of million years ago, the commencement of our geological Earth. The globe was \"fiery, cool and radiant as itsethereal men and animals during the first Round,\" says the Commentary, uttering a contradiction or paradox in the opinion of ourpresent Science; \"luminous and more dense and heavy during the second Round; watery during the Third!\" Thus are the elementsreversed.** If we had to frame our conclusions according to the data furnished to us by the [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 253 THE GREAT ARCHAEUS."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"earth as a state of matter to their stock as well as the three other elements in their present transformation.

We are told that gigantic masses of carbon, which existed formerly spread in the atmosphere as Carbonic Acid, were absorbedby plants, while a large proportion of that gas was mixed in the water. Now, if this be so, and we have to believe that all the CarbonicAcid which went to compose those plants that formed bituminous coal, lignite, etc., and went towards the formation of limestone, andso on, that all this was at that period in the atmosphere in gaseous form, then, there must have been seas and oceans of liquidcarbonic acid? But how then could the carboniferous period be preceded by the Devonian and Silurian ages -- those of Fishes andMolluscs -- on that assumption? Barometric pressure, moreover, must have exceeded several hundred times the pressure of our presentatmosphere. How could organisms, even so simple as those of certain fishes and molluscs, stand that? There is a curious work byBlanchard, on the Origin of Life, wherein he shows some strange contradictions and confusions in the theories of his colleagues, andwhich we recommend to the reader's attention.* Eliphas Levi shows it very truly \"a force in Nature,\" by means of which \"a single man who can master it . . . might throw the world intoconfusion and transform its face\"; for it is the \"great Arcanum of transcendent Magic.\" Quoting the words of the great Western Kabalistin their translated form (see The Mysteries of Magic, by A. E. Waite), we may explain them perhaps the better by the occasionaladdition of a word or two to show the difference between Western and Eastern explanations of the same subject. The Author says ofthe great Magic Agent -- \"This ambient and all-penetrating fluid, this ray detached from the (Central or 'Spiritual') Sun's splendour . . .fixed by the weight of the atmosphere (?!) and the power of central attraction . . . the Astral Light, this electromagnetic ether, this vitaland luminous caloric, is represented on ancient monuments by the girdle of Isis which twines round two poles and in ancienttheogonies by the serpent devouring its own tail, emblem of prudence and of Saturn\" -- emblem of infinity, immortality, and Kronos --\"Time\" -- not the god Saturn or the planet. \"It is the winged dragon of Medea, the double serpent of the caduceus, and the tempter ofGenesis; but it is also the brazen snake of Moses encircling the Tau lastly, it is the devil of exoteric dogmatism, and is really the blindforce (it is not blind, and Levi knew it), which souls must conquer in order to detach themselves from the chains of Earth; 'for if theyshould not,' they will be absorbed by the same power which first produced them and will return to the central and eternal fire.\" Thisgreat archaeus is now discovered by, and only for one man -- Mr. J. W. Keeley, of [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 254 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Nitrogen, \"the breath of the Supporters of the Heavenly Dome,\" as the Mohammedan mystics call it; WATER, that primordial fluidwhich was required, according to Moses, to make a living soul with. And this may account for the flagrant discrepancies andunscientific statements found in Genesis. Separate the first from the second chapter; read the former as a scripture of the Elohists, andthe latter as that of the far younger Jehovists; still one finds, if one reads between the lines, the same order in which things createdappear -- namely, Fire (light), Air, Water, and MAN (or the Earth). For the sentence: \"In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth\"is a mistranslation; it is not \"Heaven and Earth,\" but the duplex or dual Heaven, the upper and the lower Heavens, or the separation ofprimordial substance that was light in its upper and dark in its lower portions -- or the manifested Universe -- in its duality of theinvisible (to the senses) and the visible to our perceptions. God divided the light from the Darkness (v. 4); and then made thefirmament, air (5), \"a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters,\" (6), i.e., \"the waters which wereunder the firmament (our manifested visible Universe) from the waters above the firmament,\" or the (to us) invisible planes of being. Inthe second chapter (the Jehovistic), plants and herbs are created before water, just as in the first, light is produced before the Sun.\"God made the Earth and the Heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the Earth and every herb of the field before itgrew; for the Elohim ('gods') had not caused it to rain upon the earth, etc.\" (v. 5) -- an absurdity unless the esoteric explanation isaccepted. The plants were created before they were in the earth -- for there was no earth then such as it is now; and the herb of thefield was in existence before it grew as it does now in the fourth Round.Discussing and explaining the nature of the invisible Elements and the \"primordial fire\" mentioned above, Eliphas Levi calls itinvariably the \"Astral Light.\" It is the \"grand Agent Magique\" with him; undeniably it is so, but -- only so far as Black Magic isconcerned, and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Philadelphia. For others, however, it is discovered, yet must remain almost useless. \"So farshalt thou go. . . .\"All the above is as practical as it is correct, save one error, which we will explain in the text further on. Eliphas Levi commits a greatblunder in always identifying the Astral Light with what we call Akasa. What it really is will be given in Part II. of Vol. II.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 255 BUT WHY SLANDER THE INDIAN HIEROPHANTS?on the lowest planes of what we call Ether, the noumenon of which is Akasa; and even this would be held incorrect by orthodoxOccultists. The \"Astral Light\" is simply the older \"sidereal Light\" of Paracelsus; and to say that \"everything which exists has been"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"evolved from it, and it preserves and reproduces all forms,\" as he writes, is to enunciate truth only in the second proposition. The firstis erroneous; for if all that exists was evolved through (or via) it, it is not the astral light. The latter is not the container of all things butonly the reflector, at best, of this all. Eliphas Levi writes:--\"The great Magic agent is the fourth emanation of the life principle (we say -- it is the first in the inner, and the second in the outer(our) Universe), of which the Sun is the third form . . . for the day-star (the sun) is only the reflection and material shadow of the CentralSun of truth, which illuminates the intellectual (invisible) world of Spirit and which itself is but a gleam borrowed from theABSOLUTE.\"So far he is right enough. But when the great authority of the Western Kabalists adds that nevertheless, \"it is not the immortal Spirit asthe Indian Hierophants have imagined\" -- we answer that he slanders the said Hierophants, as they have said nothing of the kind;while even the Puranic exoteric writings flatly contradict the assertion. No Hindu has ever mistaken Prakriti -- the Astral Light beingonly above the lowest plane of Prakriti, the material Kosmos -- for the \"immortal Spirit.\" Prakriti is ever called Maya, illusion, and isdoomed to disappear with the rest, the gods included, at the hour of the Pralaya; for it is shown that Akasa is not even the Ether, leastof all then, we imagine, can it be the Astral Light. Those unable to penetrate beyond the dead letter of the Puranas, haveoccasionally confused Akasa with Prakriti, with Ether, and even with the visible Sky! It is true also that those who have invariablytranslated the term Akasa by \"Ether\" (Wilson, for instance), finding it called \"the material cause of sound\" possessing, moreover, thisone single property (Vishnu Purana), have ignorantly imagined it to be \"material,\" in the physical sense. True, again, that if thecharacteristics are accepted literally, then, since nothing material or physical, and therefore conditioned and temporary can beimmortal -- according to metaphysics and philosophy -- it would follow that Akasa is neither infinite nor immortal. But all this iserroneous, since both the words Pradhana------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 256 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(primeval matter) and sound, as a property, have been misunderstood; the former term (Pradhana) being certainly synonymous withMulaprakriti and Akasa, and the latter (sound) with the Verbum, the Word or the Logos. This is easy to demonstrate; for it is shown inthe following sentences in Vishnu Purana: \"In the beginning there was neither day nor night, nor sky, nor earth, nor darkness, nor light.. . . . Save only ONE, unapprehensible by intellect, or that which is Brahma and Pums (Spirit) and Pradhana (primordial matter).\" . . . .(Book I., ch. ii.).Now, what is Pradhana, if it is not Mulaprakriti, the root of all, in another aspect? For Pradhana, though said further on to merge intothe Deity as everything else does, in order to leave the ONE absolute during the Pralaya, yet is held as infinite and immortal. TheCommentator describes the Deity as: \"One Pradhanika Brahma Spirit: THAT, was,\" and interprets the compound term as asubstantive, not as a derivative word used attributively, i.e., like something conjoined with Pradhana.* Hence Pradhana even in thePuranas is an aspect of Parabrahmam, not an evolution, and must be the same as the Vedantic Mulaprakriti. \"Prakriti in its primarystate is Akasa,\" says a Vedantin scholar (see \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" p. 169). It is almost abstract Nature.Akasa, then, is Pradhana in another form, and as such cannot be Ether, the ever-invisible agent, courted even by physical Science.Nor is it Astral Light. It is, as said, the noumenon of the seven-fold differentiated Prakriti** -- the ever immaculate \"Mother\" of thefatherless Son, who becomes \"Father\" on the lower manifested plane. For MAHAT is the first product of Pradhana, or Akasa, andMahat -- Universal intelligence \"whose characteristic property is Buddhi\" -- is no other than the Logos, for he is called \"Eswara\"Brahma, Bhava, etc. (See Linga Purana, sec. lxx. 12 et seq.; and Vayu Purana, but especially the former Purana -- prior, section viii.,67-74). He is, in short, the \"Creator\" or the divine mind in creative operation, \"the cause of all things.\" He is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The student has to note, moreover, that the Purana is a dualistic system, not evolutionary, and that, in this respect, far more will befound, from an esoteric standpoint, in Sankhya, and even in the Manava-dharma-Sastra, however much the latter differs from theformer.** In the Sankhya philosophy, the seven Prakritis or \"productive productions\" are Mahat, Ahamkara, and the five tanmatras. See\"Sankhya-karika,\" III., and the Commentary thereon.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 257 AKASA IS NOT ETHER.the \"first-born\" of whom the Puranas tell us that \"Mahat and matter are the inner and outer boundaries of the Universe,\" or, in ourlanguage, the negative and the positive poles of dual nature (abstract and concrete), for the Purana adds: \"In this manner -- as werethe seven forms (principles) of Prakriti reckoned from Mahat to Earth -- so at the time of pralaya (pratyahara) these seven successivelyre-enter into each other. The egg of Brahma (Sarva-mandala) is dissolved with its seven zones (dwipa), seven oceans, seven regions,etc.\" (Vishnu Purana, Book vi., ch. iv.)*These are the reasons why the Occultists refuse to give the name of Astral Light to Akasa, or to call it Ether. \"In my Father's house aremany mansions,\" may be contrasted with the occult saying, \"In our Mother's house there are seven mansions,\" or planes, the lowest ofwhich is above and around us -- the Astral Light."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The elements, whether simple or compound, could not have remained the same since the commencement of the evolution of ourchain.

So on this identical subject of the seven Prakritis or the seven zones of Brahma's egg, the two accounts differtotally. In Vol. 1, page 40, the egg is said to be externally invested by seven envelopes -- Wilson comments: \"by Water, Air, Fire,Ether, and Ahamkara\" (which last word does not exist in the Sanskrit texts); and in vol. v., p. 198, of the same Vishnu Purana it iswritten, \"in this manner were the seven forms of nature (Prakriti) reckoned from Mahat to Earth\" (?). Between Mahat or Maha-Buddhiand \"Water, etc.,\" the difference is very considerable.** According to the great metaphysician Hegel also. For him Nature was a perpetual becoming. A purely esoteric conception. Creationor Origin, in the Christian sense of the term, is absolutely unthinkable.

And only during that Round will those higher senses, the growth and development of which Akasasubserves, be susceptible of a complete expansion. As already indicated, a partial familiarity with the characteristic of matter --permeability -- which should be developed concurrently with the sixth sense, may be expected to develop at the proper period in thisRound. But with the next element added to our resources in the next Round, permeability will become so manifest a characteristic ofmatter, that the densest forms of this will seem to man's perceptions as obstructive to him as a thick fog, and no more.Let us return to the life-cycle now. Without entering at length upon the description given of the higher LIVES, we must direct ourattention at present simply to the earthly beings and the earth itself. The latter, we are told, is built up for the first Round by the\"Devourers\" which disintegrate and differentiate the germs of other lives in the Elements; pretty much, it must be supposed, as in thepresent stage of the world, the aerobes do, when, undermining and loosening the chemical structure in an organism, they transformanimal matter and generate substances that vary in their constitutions. Thus Occultism disposes of the so-called Azoic age of Science,for it shows that there never was a time when the Earth was without life upon it. Wherever there is an atom of matter, a particle or amolecule, even in its most gaseous condition, there is life in it, however latent and unconscious. \"Whatsoever quits the Laya State,becomes active life; it is drawn into the vortex of MOTION (the alchemical solvent of Life); Spirit and Matter are the two States of theONE, which is neither Spirit nor Matter, both being the absolute life, latent.\" (Book of Dzyan, Comm. III., par. 18). . . . \"Spirit is the firstdifferentiation of (and in) SPACE; and Matter the first differentiation of Spirit. That, which is neither Spirit nor matter -- that is IT -- theCauseless CAUSE of Spirit and Matter, which are the Cause of Kosmos. And THAT we call the ONE LIFE or the Intra-Cosmic Breath.\"Once more we will say -- like must produce like. Absolute Life cannot produce an inorganic atom whether single or complex, andthere is life------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 259 ATOMS ARE INVISIBLE LIVES.even in laya just as a man in a profound cataleptic state -- to all appearance a corpse -- is still a living being.When the \"Devourers\" (in whom the men of science are invited to see, with some show of reason, atoms of the Fire-Mist, if they will, asthe Occultist will offer no objection to this); when the \"Devourers,\" we say, have differentiated \"the fire-atoms\" by a peculiar process ofsegmentation, the latter become life-germs, which aggregate according to the laws of cohesion and affinity. Then the life-germsproduce lives of another kind, which work on the structure of our globes. * * * *Thus, in the first Round, the globe, having been built by the primitive fire-lives, i.e., formed into a sphere -- had no solidity, norqualifications, save a cold brightness, nor form nor colour; it is only towards the end of the First Round that it developed one Elementwhich from its inorganic, so to say, or simple Essence became now in our Round the fire we know throughout the system. The Earthwas in her first rupa, the essence of which is the Akasic principle named *** \"that which is now known as, and very erroneously termed,Astral Light, which Eliphas Levi calls \"the imagination of Nature,\"** probably to avoid giving it its correct name, as others do.\"It is through and from the radiations of the seven bodies of the seven orders of Dhyanis, that the seven discrete quantities (Elements),whose motion and harmonious Union produce the manifested Universe of Matter, are born.\" (Commentary.)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"** Speaking of it in his Preface to the \"History of Magic\" Eliphas Levi says: \"It is through this Force that all the nervous centres secretlycommunicate with each other; from it -- that sympathy and antipathy are born; from it -- that we have our dreams; and that thephenomena of second sight and extra-natural visions take place. . . . . Astral Light, acting under the impulsion of powerful wills,destroys, coagulates, separates, breaks, gathers in all things. . . . God created it on that day when he said: Fiat Lux, and it is directedby the Egregores, i.e., the chiefs of the souls who are the spirits of energy and action.\" Eliphas Levi ought to have added that theastral light, or primordial substance, if matter at all, is that which, called Light, LUX, esoterically explained, is the body of those Spiritsthemselves, and their very essence. Our physical light is the manifestation on our plane and the reflected radiance of the Divine Lightemanating from the collective body of those who are called the \"LIGHTS\" and the \"FLAMES.\" But no other Kabalist has ever had thetalent of heaping up one contradiction on the other, of making one paradox chase another in the same sentence and in such flowinglanguage, as Eliphas Levi. He leads his reader through the most lovely, gorgeously blooming valleys, to strand him after all on adesert and barren rocky island.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 260 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The Second Round brings into manifestation the second element AIR, that element, the purity of which would ensure continuous lifeto him who would use it. There have been two occultists only in Europe who have discovered and even partially applied it in practice,though its composition has always been known among the highest Eastern Initiates. The ozone of the modern chemists is poisoncompared with the real universal solvent which could never be thought of unless it existed in nature. \"From the second Round, Earth --hitherto a foetus in the matrix of Space -- began its real existence: it had developed individual sentient life, its second principle. Thesecond corresponds to the sixth (principle); the second is life continuous, the other, temporary.\"The Third Round developed the third Principle -- WATER; while the Fourth transformed the gaseous fluids and plastic form of ourglobe into the hard, crusted, grossly material sphere we are living on. \"Bhumi\" has reached her fourth principle. To this it may beobjected that the law of analogy, so much insisted upon, is broken. Not at all. Earth will reach her true ultimate form -- (inversely inthis to man) -- her body shell -- only toward the end of the manvantara after the Seventh Round. Eugenius Philalethes was right whenhe assured his readers on his word of honour that no one had yet seen the Earth (i.e., MATTER in its essential form). Our globe is, sofar, in its Kamarupic state -- the astral body of desires of Ahamkara, dark Egotism, the progeny of Mahat, on the lower plane. . . .It is not molecularly constituted matter -- least of all the human body (sthulasarira) -- that is the grossest of all our \"principles,\" butverily the middle principle, the real animal centre; whereas our body is but its shell, the irresponsible factor and medium throughwhich the beast in us acts all its life. Every intellectual theosophist will understand my real meaning. Thus the idea that the humantabernacle is built by countless lives, just in the same way as the rocky crust of our Earth was, has nothing repulsive in it for the truemystic. Nor can Science oppose the occult teaching, for it is not because the microscope will ever fail to detect the ultimate livingatom or life, that it can reject the doctrine.(c) Science teaches us that the living as well as the dead organism of both man and animal are swarming with bacteria of a hundredvarious------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 261 THE OCCULT CHEMISTRY.kinds; that from without we are threatened with the invasion of microbes with every breath we draw, and from within by leucomaines,aerobes, anaerobes, and what not. But Science never yet went so far as to assert with the occult doctrine that our bodies, as well asthose of animals, plants, and stones, are themselves altogether built up of such beings; which, except larger species, no microscopecan detect. So far, as regards the purely animal and material portion of man, Science is on its way to discoveries that will go fartowards corroborating this theory. Chemistry and physiology are the two great magicians of the future, who are destined to open theeyes of mankind to the great physical truths. With every day, the identity between the animal and physical man, between the plantand man, and even between the reptile and its nest, the rock, and man -- is more and more clearly shown. The physical and chemicalconstituents of all being found to be identical, chemical science may well say that there is no difference between the matter whichcomposes the ox and that which forms man. But the Occult doctrine is far more explicit. It says:--- Not only the chemical compoundsare the same, but the same infinitesimal invisible lives compose the atoms of the bodies of the mountain and the daisy, of man andthe ant, of the elephant, and of the tree which shelters him from the sun. Each particle -- whether you call it organic or inorganic -- is alife. Every atom and molecule in the Universe is both life-giving and death-giving to that form, inasmuch as it builds by aggregationuniverses and the ephemeral vehicles ready to receive the transmigrating soul, and as eternally destroys and changes the forms andexpels those souls from their temporary abodes. It creates and kills; it is self-generating and self-destroying; it brings into being, andannihilates, that mystery of mysteries -- the living body of man, animal, or plant, every second in time and space; and it generatesequally life and death, beauty and ugliness, good and bad, and even the agreeable and disagreeable, the beneficent andmaleficent sensations. It is that mysterious LIFE, represented collectively by countless myriads of lives, that follows in its own sporadicway, the hitherto incomprehensible law of Atavism; that copies family resemblances as well as those it finds impressed in the aura ofthe generators of every future human being, a mystery, in short, that will receive fuller attention elsewhere. For the present, oneinstance may be cited in illustration. Modern science begins to find out that ptomaine (the alkaloid poison generated by decayingmatter and corpses -- a life also) extracted------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 262 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"with the help of volatile ether, yields a smell as strong and equal to that of the freshest orange-blossoms; but that free from oxygen,these alkaloids yield either a most sickening, disgusting smell, or the most agreeable aroma which recalls that of the most delicatelyscented flowers. And it is suspected that such blossoms owe their agreeable smell to the poisonous ptomaine; the venomous essenceof certain mushrooms (fungi) being nearly identical with the venom of the cobra of India, the most deadly of serpents.* Thus, havingdiscovered the effects, Science has to find their PRIMARY CAUSES; and this it can never do without the help of the old sciences, ofalchemy, occult botany and physics. We are taught that every physiological change, in addition to pathological phenomena; diseases-- nay, life itself -- or rather the objective phenomena of life, produced by certain conditions and changes in the tissues of the bodywhich allow and force life to act in that body; that all this is due to those unseen CREATORS and DESTROYERS that are called insuch a loose and general way, microbes.** Such[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The French savants Arnaud, Gautier, and Villiers, have found in the saliva of living men the same venomous alkaloid as in that ofthe toad, the salamander, the cobra, and the trigonocephalus of Portugal. It is proven that venom of the deadliest kind, whethercalled ptomaine, or leucomaine, or alkaloid, is generated by living men, animals, and plants. The same savant, Gautier, discoveredan alkaloid in the fresh meat of an ox and in its brains, and a venom which he calls Xanthocreatinine similar to the substanceextracted from the poisonous saliva of reptiles. It is the muscular tissues, as being the most active organ in the animal economy, thatare suspected of being the generators or factors of venoms, having the same importance as carbonic acid and urea in the functions oflife, which venoms are the ultimate products of inner combustion. And though it is not yet fully determined whether poisons can begenerated by the animal system of living beings without the participation and interference of microbes, it is ascertained that theanimal does produce venomous substances in its physiological or living state.** It might be supposed that these \"fiery lives\" and the microbes of science are identical. This is not true. The \"fiery lives\" are theseventh and highest subdivision of the plane of matter, and correspond in the individual with the One Life of the Universe, thoughonly on that plane. The microbes of science are the first and lowest sub-division on the second plane -- that of material prana (or life).The physical body of man undergoes a complete change of structure every seven years, and its destruction and preservation are dueto the alternate function of the fiery lives as \"destroyers\" and \"builders.\" They are \"builders\" by sacrificing themselves in the form ofvitality to restrain the destructive influence of the microbes, and, by supplying the microbes with what is necessary, they compel themunder that restraint to build up the material body and its cells. They are \"destroyers\" also when that restraint is [[Footnote continuedon next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 263 PARACELSUS DIED TOO EARLY.experimenters as Pasteur are the best friends and helpers of the Destroyers and the worst enemies of the Creators -- if the latter werenot at the same time destroyers too. However it may be, one thing is sure in this: The knowledge of these primary causes and of theultimate essence of every element, of its lives, their functions, properties, and conditions of change -- constitutes the basis of MAGIC.Paracelsus was, perhaps, the only Occultist in Europe, during the last centuries since the Christian era, who was versed in this mystery.Had not a criminal hand put an end to his life, years before the time allotted him by Nature, physiological Magic would have fewersecrets for the civilized world than it now has.(d) But what has the Moon to do in all this? we may be asked. What have \"Fish, Sin and Moon\" in the apocalyptic saying of theStanza to do in company with the \"Life-microbes\"? With the latter nothing, except availing themselves of the tabernacle of clayprepared by them; with divine perfect man everything, since \"Fish, Sin and Moon\" make conjointly the three symbols of the immortalBeing.This is all that can be given. Nor does the writer pretend to know more of this strange symbol than may be inferred about it fromexoteric religions; from the mystery perhaps, which underlies the Matsya (fish)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] removed and the microbes, unsupplied with vital constructive energy, are left to run riot asdestructive agents. Thus, during the first half of a man's life (the first five periods of seven years each) the \"fiery lives\" are indirectlyengaged in the process of building up man's material body; life is on the ascending scale, and the force is used in construction andincrease. After this period is passed the age of retrogression commences, and, the work of the \"fiery lives\" exhausting their strength,the work of destruction and decrease also commences.An analogy between cosmic events in the descent of spirit into matter for the first half of a manvantara (planetary as human) and itsascent at the expense of matter in the second half, may here be traced. These considerations have to do solely with the plane ofmatter, but the restraining influence of the \"fiery lives\" on the lowest sub-division of the second plane -- the microbes -- is confirmed bythe fact mentioned in the foot-note on Pasteur (vide supra) that the cells of the organs, when they do not find sufficient oxygen forthemselves, adapt themselves to that condition and form ferments, which, by absorbing oxygen from substances coming in contactwith them, ruin the latter. Thus the process is commenced by one cell robbing its neighbour of the source of its vitality when thesupply is insufficient; and the ruin so commenced steadily progresses.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 264 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Avatar of Vishnu, the Chaldean Oannes -- the Man-Fish, recorded in the imperishable sign of the Zodiac, Pisces, and runningthroughout the two Testaments in the personages of Joshua \"Son of the Fish (Nun)\" and Jesus; the allegorical \"Sin\" or Fall of Spiritinto matter, and the Moon -- in so far as it relates to the \"Lunar\" ancestors, the Pitris.For the present it may be as well to remind the reader that while the Moon-goddesses were connected in every mythology, especiallythe Grecian, with child-birth, because of the lunar influence on women and conception, the occult and actual connection of oursatellite with fecundation is to this day unknown to physiology, which regards every popular practice in this reference as grosssuperstition.

The latter simile answers only to one side of thequestion -- the most material; since re-absorption is by no means such a \"dreamless sleep,\" but, on the contrary, absolute existence,an unconditioned unity, or a state, to describe which human language is absolutely and hopelessly inadequate. The only approach toanything like a comprehensive conception of it can be attempted solely in the panoramic visions of the soul, through spiritualideations of the divine monad.

And that Doctrine says that the Dhyani-Buddhas of the two higher groups, namely, the \"Watchers\" or the\"Architects,\" furnished the many and various races with divine kings and leaders. It is the latter who taught humanity their arts andsciences, and the former who revealed to the incarnated Monads that had just shaken off their vehicles of the lower Kingdoms -- andwho had, therefore, lost every recollection of their divine origin -- the great spiritual truths of the transcendental worlds. (See Book II.,\"Divine Dynasties.\")Thus, as expressed in the Stanza, the Watchers descended on Earth and reigned over men -- \"who are themselves.\" The reigningkings had finished their cycle on Earth and other worlds, in the preceding Rounds. In the future manvantaras they will have risen tohigher systems than our planetary world; and it is the Elect of our Humanity, the Pioneers on the hard and difficult path of Progress,who will take the places of their predecessors. The next great Manvantara will witness the men of our own life-cycle becoming theinstructors and guides of a mankind whose Monads may now yet be imprisoned -- semi-conscious -- in the most intellectual of theanimal kingdom, while their lower principles will be animating, perhaps, the highest specimens of the Vegetable world.Thus proceed the cycles of the septenary evolution, in Septennial nature; the Spiritual or divine; the psychic or semi-divine; theintellectual, the passional, the instinctual, or cognitional; the semi-corporeal and the purely material or physical natures.

The reason for this I venture to state here as I learned itfrom a Master.The name, \"Upanishads,\" is usually translated \"esoteric doctrine.\" These treatises form part of the Sruti or \"revealed knowledge,\"Revelation, in short, and are generally attached to the Brahmana------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 270 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.portion of the Vedas,* as their third division. There are over 150 Upanishads enumerated by, and known to, Orientalists, who credit theoldest with being written probably about 600 years B.C.; but of genuine texts there does not exist a fifth of the number. TheUpanishads are to the Vedas what the Kabala is to the Jewish Bible. They treat of and expound the secret and mystic meaning of theVedic texts. They speak of the origin of the Universe, the nature of Deity, and of Spirit and Soul, as also of the metaphysicalconnection of mind and matter. In a few words: They CONTAIN the beginning and the end of all human knowledge, but they havenow ceased to REVEAL it, since the day of Buddha. If it were otherwise, the Upanishads could not be called esoteric, since they arenow openly attached to the Sacred Brahmanical books, which have, in our present age, become accessible even to the Mlechchhas(out-castes) and the European Orientalists. One thing in them -- and this in all the Upanishads -- invariably and constantly points totheir ancient origin, and proves (a) that they were written, in some of their portions, before the caste system became the tyrannicalinstitution which it still is; and (b) that half of their contents have been eliminated, while some of them were rewritten and abridged.\"The great Teachers of the higher Knowledge and the Brahmans are continually represented as going to Kshatriya (military caste)kings to become their pupils.\" As Cowell pertinently remarks, the Upanishads \"breathe an entirely different spirit\" (from otherBrahmanical writings), \"a freedom of thought unknown in any earlier work except in the Rig Veda hymns themselves.\" The second factis explained by a tradition recorded in one of the MSS. on Buddha's life. It says that the Upanishads were originally attached to theirBrahmanas after the beginning of a reform, which led to the exclusiveness of the present caste system among the Brahmins, a fewcenturies after the invasion of India by the \"twice-born.\" They were complete in those days, and were used for the instruction of thechelas who were preparing for their initiation.[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* . . . \"The Vedas have a distinct dual meaning -- one expressed by the literal sense of the words, the other indicated by the metre andthe swara -- intonation -- which are as the life of the Vedas. . . .

Thenit was that the Brahmins, seeing that their sacred knowledge and Occult wisdom was falling into the hands of the \"Mlechchhas,\"abridged the texts of the Upanishads, originally containing thrice the matter of the Vedas and the Brahmanas together, withoutaltering, however, one word of the texts. They simply detached from the MSS. the most important portions containing the last word ofthe Mystery of Being. The key to the Brahmanical secret code remained henceforth with the initiates alone, and the Brahmins werethus in a position to publicly deny the correctness of Buddha's teaching by appealing to their Upanishads, silenced for ever on thechief questions. Such is the esoteric tradition beyond the Himalayas.Sri Sankaracharya, the greatest Initiate living in the historical ages, wrote many a Bhashya on the Upanishads. But his originaltreatises, as there are reasons to suppose, have not yet fallen into the hands of the Philistines, for they are too jealously preserved inhis maths (monasteries, mathams). And there are still weightier reasons to believe that the priceless Bhashyas (Commentaries) on theesoteric doctrine of the Brahmins, by their greatest expounder, will remain for ages yet a dead letter to most of the Hindus, except theSmartava Brahmins.

The reason of this is that they alone, I am informed, have occasionally real Initiates at their head in theirmathams, as for instance, in the \"Sringa-giri,\" in the Western Ghats of Mysore. On the other hand, there is no sect in that desperatelyexclusive caste of the Brahmins, more exclusive than is the Smartava; and the reticence of its followers to say what they may know ofthe Occult sciences and the esoteric doctrine, is only equalled by their pride and learning.Therefore the writer of the present statement must be prepared beforehand to meet with great opposition and even the denial of suchstatements as are brought forward in this work. Not that any claim to infallibility, or to perfect correctness in every detail of all thatwhich is herein said, was ever put forward. Facts are there, and they can hardly be denied. But, owing to the intrinsic difficulties of thesubjects treated, and the almost insurmountable limitations of the English tongue (as of all other European languages) to expresscertain ideas, it is more than probable that the writer has failed to present the explanations in the best and in the clearest form; yet allthat could be done was done under every adverse circumstance, and this is the utmost that can be expected of any writer.Let us recapitulate and show, by the vastness of the subjects expounded, how difficult, if not impossible, it is to do them full justice.(1.) The Secret Doctrine is the accumulated Wisdom of the Ages, and its cosmogony alone is the most stupendous and elaboratesystem: e.g., even in the exotericism of the Puranas. But such is the mysterious power of Occult symbolism, that the facts which haveactually occupied countless generations of initiated seers and prophets to marshal, to set down and explain, in the bewildering seriesof evolutionary progress, are all recorded on a few pages of geometrical signs and glyphs. The flashing gaze of those seers haspenetrated into the very kernel of matter, and recorded the soul of things there, where an ordinary profane, however learned, wouldhave perceived but the external work of form. But modern science believes not in the \"soul of things,\" and hence will reject the wholesystem of ancient cosmogony. It is useless to say that the system in question is no fancy of one or several isolated individuals. That itis the uninterrupted record covering thousands of generations of Seers whose respective experiences were made to test and to verifythe------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 273 THE PITH AND MARROW OF OCCULTISM.traditions passed orally by one early race to another, of the teachings of higher and exalted beings, who watched over the childhoodof Humanity. That for long ages, the \"Wise Men\" of the Fifth Race, of the stock saved and rescued from the last cataclysm and shiftingof continents, had passed their lives in learning, not teaching. How did they do so? It is answered: by checking, testing, and verifyingin every department of nature the traditions of old by the independent visions of great adepts; i.e., men who have developed andperfected their physical, mental, psychic, and spiritual organisations to the utmost possible degree. No vision of one adept wasaccepted till it was checked and confirmed by the visions -- so obtained as to stand as independent evidence -- of other adepts, and bycenturies of experiences.(2.) The fundamental Law in that system, the central point from which all emerged, around and toward which all gravitates, and uponwhich is hung the philosophy of the rest, is the One homogeneous divine SUBSTANCE-PRINCIPLE, the one radical cause.. . . \"Some few, whose lamps shone brighter, have been ledFrom cause to cause to nature's secret head,And found that one first Principle must be. . . .\""},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"It is called \"Substance-Principle,\" for it becomes \"substance\" on the plane of the manifested Universe, an illusion, while it remains a\"principle\" in the beginningless and endless abstract, visible and invisible SPACE. It is the omnipresent Reality: impersonal, becauseit contains all and everything. Its impersonality is the fundamental conception of the System. It is latent in every atom in the Universe,and is the Universe itself. (See in chapters on Symbolism, \"Primordial Substance, and Divine Thought.\")(3.) The Universe is the periodical manifestation of this unknown Absolute Essence. To call it \"essence,\" however, is to sin against thevery spirit of the philosophy. For though the noun may be derived in this case from the verb esse, \"to be,\" yet IT cannot be identifiedwith a being of any kind, that can be conceived by human intellect. IT is best described as neither Spirit nor matter, but both.\"Parabrahmam and Mulaprakriti\" are One, in reality, yet two in the Universal conception of the manifested, even in the conception ofthe One Logos, its first manifestation, to which, as the able lecturer in the \"Notes on the Bhagavadgita\" shows, IT appears from theobjective standpoint of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 274 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the One Logos as Mulaprakriti and not as Parabrahmam; as its veil and not the one REALITY hidden behind, which is unconditionedand absolute.(4.) The Universe is called, with everything in it, MAYA, because all is temporary therein, from the ephemeral life of a fire-fly to that ofthe Sun. Compared to the eternal immutability of the ONE, and the changelessness of that Principle, the Universe, with itsevanescent ever-changing forms, must be necessarily, in the mind of a philosopher, no better than a will-o'-the-wisp. Yet, the Universeis real enough to the conscious beings in it, which are as unreal as it is itself.(5.) Everything in the Universe, throughout all its kingdoms, is CONSCIOUS: i.e., endowed with a consciousness of its own kind and onits own plane of perception. We men must remember that because we do not perceive any signs -- which we can recognise -- ofconsciousness, say, in stones, we have no right to say that no consciousness exists there. There is no such thing as either \"dead\" or\"blind\" matter, as there is no \"Blind\" or \"Unconscious\" Law. These find no place among the conceptions of Occult philosophy. Thelatter never stops at surface appearances, and for it the noumenal essences have more reality than their objective counterparts; itresembles therein the mediaeval Nominalists, for whom it was the Universals that were the realities and the particulars which existedonly in name and human fancy.(6.) The Universe is worked and guided from within outwards. As above so it is below, as in heaven so on earth; and man -- themicrocosm and miniature copy of the macrocosm -- is the living witness to this Universal Law, and to the mode of its action. We seethat every external motion, act, gesture, whether voluntary or mechanical, organic or mental, is produced and preceded by internalfeeling or emotion, will or volition, and thought or mind. As no outward motion or change, when normal, in man's external body cantake place unless provoked by an inward impulse, given through one of the three functions named, so with the external or manifestedUniverse. The whole Kosmos is guided, controlled, and animated by almost endless series of Hierarchies of sentient Beings, eachhaving a mission to perform, and who -- whether we give to them one name or another, and call them Dhyan-Chohans or Angels -- are\"messengers\" in the sense only that they are the agents of Karmic and Cosmic Laws. They vary infinitely in their------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 275 THE NATURE OF THE CELESTIAL MEN.respective degrees of consciousness and intelligence; and to call them all pure Spirits without any of the earthly alloy \"which time iswont to prey upon\" is only to indulge in poetical fancy. For each of these Beings either was, or prepares to become, a man, if not inthe present, then in a past or a coming cycle (Manvantara). They are perfected, when not incipient, men; and differ morally from theterrestrial human beings on their higher (less material) spheres, only in that they are devoid of the feeling of personality and of thehuman emotional nature -- two purely earthly characteristics. The former, or the \"perfected,\" have become free from those feelings,because (a) they have no longer fleshly bodies -- an ever-numbing weight on the Soul; and (b) the pure spiritual element being leftuntrammelled and more free, they are less influenced by maya than man can ever be, unless he is an adept who keeps his twopersonalities -- the spiritual and the physical -- entirely separated. The incipient monads, having never had terrestrial bodies yet, canhave no sense of personality or EGO-ism. That which is meant by \"personality,\" being a limitation and a relation, or, as defined byColeridge, \"individuality existing in itself but with a nature as a ground,\" the term cannot of course be applied to non-human entities;but, as a fact insisted upon by generations of Seers, none of these Beings, high or low, have either individuality or personality asseparate Entities, i.e., they have no individuality in the sense in which a man says, \"I am myself and no one else;\" in other words, theyare conscious of no such distinct separateness as men and things have on earth. Individuality is the characteristic of their respectivehierarchies, not of their units; and these characteristics vary only with the degree of the plane to which those hierarchies belong: thenearer to the region of Homogeneity and the One Divine, the purer and the less accentuated that individuality in the Hierarchy. Theyare finite, in all respects, with the exception of their higher principles -- the immortal sparks reflecting the universal divine flame --individualized and separated only on the spheres of Illusion by a differentiation as illusive as the rest. They are \"Living Ones,\"because they are the streams projected on the Kosmic screen of illusion from the ABSOLUTE LIFE; beings in whom life cannotbecome extinct, before the fire of ignorance is extinct in those who sense these \"Lives.\" Having sprung into being under thequickening influence of the uncreated beam, the reflection of the great Central Sun that------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 276 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"radiates on the shores of the river of Life, it is the inner principle in them which belongs to the waters of immortality, while itsdifferentiated clothing is as perishable as man's body. Therefore Young was right in saying that\"Angels are men of a superior kind\"and no more. They are neither \"ministering\" nor \"protecting\" angels; nor are they \"Harbingers of the Most High\" still less the\"Messengers of wrath\" of any God such as man's fancy has created. To appeal to their protection is as foolish as to believe that theirsympathy may be secured by any kind of propitiation; for they are, as much as man himself is, the slaves and creatures of immutableKarmic and Kosmic law. The reason for it is evident. Having no elements of personality in their essence they can have no personalqualities, such as attributed by men, in their exoteric religions, to their anthropomorphic God -- a jealous and exclusive God whorejoices and feels wrathful, is pleased with sacrifice, and is more despotic in his vanity than any finite foolish man. Man, as shown inBook II., being a compound of the essences of all those celestial Hierarchies may succeed in making himself, as such, superior, in onesense, to any hierarchy or class, or even combination of them. \"Man can neither propitiate nor command the Devas,\" it is said. But, byparalyzing his lower personality, and arriving thereby at the full knowledge of the non-separateness of his higher SELF from the Oneabsolute SELF, man can, even during his terrestrial life, become as \"One of Us.\" Thus it is, by eating of the fruit of knowledge whichdispels ignorance, that man becomes like one of the Elohim or the Dhyanis; and once on their plane the Spirit of Solidarity andperfect Harmony, which reigns in every Hierarchy, must extend over him and protect him in every particular.The chief difficulty which prevents men of science from believing in divine as well as in nature Spirits is their materialism. The mainimpediment before the Spiritualist which hinders him from believing in the same, while preserving a blind belief in the \"Spirits\" of theDeparted, is the general ignorance of all, except some Occultists and Kabalists, about the true essence and nature of matter. It is onthe acceptance or rejection of the theory of the Unity of all in Nature, in its ultimate Essence, that mainly rests the belief or unbelief inthe existence around us of other conscious beings besides the Spirits of the Dead.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 277 MANY BODIES BUT ONE SOUL.It is on the right comprehension of the primeval Evolution of Spirit-Matter and its real essence that the student has to depend for thefurther elucidation in his mind of the Occult Cosmogony, and for the only sure clue which can guide his subsequent studies.In sober truth, as just shown, every \"Spirit\" so-called is either a disembodied or a future man. As from the highest Archangel (DhyanChohan) down to the last conscious \"Builder\" (the inferior class of Spiritual Entities), all such are men, having lived aeons ago, inother Manvantaras, on this or other Spheres; so the inferior, semi-intelligent and non-intelligent Elementals -- are all future men. Thatfact alone -- that a Spirit is endowed with intelligence -- is a proof to the Occultist that that Being must have been a man, andacquired his knowledge and intelligence throughout the human cycle. There is but one indivisible and absolute Omniscience andIntelligence in the Universe, and this thrills throughout every atom and infinitesimal point of the whole finite Kosmos which hath nobounds, and which people call SPACE, considered independently of anything contained in it. But the first differentiation of itsreflection in the manifested World is purely Spiritual, and the Beings generated in it are not endowed with a consciousness that hasany relation to the one we conceive of. They can have no human consciousness or Intelligence before they have acquired such,personally and individually. This may be a mystery, yet it is a fact, in Esoteric philosophy, and a very apparent one too.The whole order of nature evinces a progressive march towards a higher life. There is design in the action of the seemingly blindestforces. The whole process of evolution with its endless adaptations is a proof of this. The immutable laws that weed out the weak andfeeble species, to make room for the strong, and which ensure the \"survival of the fittest,\" though so cruel in their immediate action --all are working toward the grand end. The very fact that adaptations do occur, that the fittest do survive in the struggle for existence,shows that what is called \"unconscious Nature\"* is in reality an aggregate of forces mani-[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* Nature taken in its abstract sense, cannot be \"unconscious,\" as it is the emanation from, and thus an aspect (on the manifestedplane) of the ABSOLUTE consciousness. Where is that daring man who would presume to deny to vegetation and even to minerals aconsciousness of their own. All he can say is, that this consciousness is beyond his comprehension.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 278 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.pulated by semi-intelligent beings (Elementals) guided by High Planetary Spirits, (Dhyan Chohans), whose collective aggregate formsthe manifested verbum of the unmanifested LOGOS, and constitutes at one and the same time the MIND of the Universe and itsimmutable LAW.Three distinct representations of the Universe in its three distinct aspects are impressed upon our thought by the esoteric philosophy:the PRE-EXISTING (evolved from) the EVER-EXISTING; and the PHENOMENAL -- the world of illusion, the reflection, and shadowthereof. During the great mystery and drama of life known as the Manvantara, real Kosmos is like the object placed behind the whitescreen upon which are thrown the Chinese shadows, called forth by the magic lantern. The actual figures and things remain invisible,while the wires of evolution are pulled by the unseen hands; and men and things are thus but the reflections, on the white field, of therealities behind the snares of Mahamaya, or the great Illusion. This was taught in every philosophy, in every religion, ante as well aspost diluvian, in India and Chaldea, by the Chinese as by the Grecian Sages. In the former countries these three Universes wereallegorized, in exoteric teachings, by the three trinities emanating from the Central eternal germ and forming with it a Supreme Unity:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"the initial, the manifested, and the Creative Triad, or the three in One. The last is but the symbol, in its concrete expression, of thefirst ideal two. Hence Esoteric philosophy passes over the necessarianism of this purely metaphysical conception, and calls the firstone, only, the Ever Existing. This is the view of every one of the six great schools of Indian philosophy -- the six principles of that unitbody of WISDOM of which the \"gnosis,\" the hidden knowledge, is the seventh.The writer hopes that, superficially handled as may be the comments on the Seven Stanzas, enough has been given in thiscosmogonic portion of the work to show Archaic teachings to be more scientific (in the modern sense of the word) on their very face,than any other ancient Scriptures left to be regarded and judged on their exoteric aspect. Since, however, as confessed before, thiswork withholds far more than it gives out, the student is invited to use his own intuitions. Our chief care is to elucidate that which hasalready been given out, and, to our regret, very incorrectly at times; to supplement the knowledge hinted at -- whenever and whereverpossible -- by addi-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 279 HERMES, OR ARISTOTLE?tional matter; and to bulwark our doctrines against the too strong attacks of modern Sectarianism, and more especially against thoseof our latter-day Materialism, very often miscalled Science, whereas, in reality, the words \"Scientists\" and \"Sciolists\" ought alone tobear the responsibility for the many illogical theories offered to the world. In its great ignorance, the public, while blindly acceptingeverything that emanates from \"authorities,\" and feeling it to be its duty to regard every dictum coming from a man of Science as aproven fact -- the public, we say, is taught to scoff at anything brought forward from \"heathen\" sources. Therefore, as materialisticScientists can be fought solely with their own weapons -- those of controversy and argument -- an Addendum is added to every Bookcontrasting our respective views and showing how even great authorities may often err. We believe that this can be done effectuallyby showing the weak points of our opponents, and by proving their too frequent sophisms -- made to pass for scientific dicta -- to beincorrect. We hold to Hermes and his \"Wisdom\" -- in its universal character; they -- to Aristotle as against intuition and the experienceof the ages, fancying that Truth is the exclusive property of the Western world. Hence the disagreement. As Hermes says, \"Knowledgediffers much from sense; for sense is of things that surmount it, but Knowledge (gyi) is the end of sense\" -- i.e., of the illusion of ourphysical brain and its intellect; thus emphasizing the contrast between the laboriously acquired knowledge of the senses and mind(manas), and the intuitive omniscience of the Spiritual divine Soul -- Buddhi.Whatever may be the destiny of these actual writings in a remote future, we hope to have proven so far the following facts:(1) The Secret Doctrine teaches no Atheism, except in the Hindu sense of the word nastika, or the rejection of idols, including everyanthropomorphic god. In this sense every Occultist is a Nastika.(2) It admits a Logos or a collective \"Creator\" of the Universe; a Demi-urgos -- in the sense implied when one speaks of an \"Architect\"as the \"Creator\" of an edifice, whereas that Architect has never touched one stone of it, but, while furnishing the plan, left all themanual labour to the masons; in our case the plan was furnished by the Ideation of the Universe, and the constructive labour was leftto the Hosts of intelligent Powers and Forces. But that Demiurgos is no------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 280 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.personal deity, -- i.e., an imperfect extra-cosmic god, -- but only the aggregate of the Dhyan-Chohans and the other forces.As to the latter --(3) They are dual in their character; being composed of (a) the irrational brute energy, inherent in matter, and (b) the intelligent soulor cosmic consciousness which directs and guides that energy, and which is the Dhyan-Chohanic thought reflecting the Ideation of theUniversal mind. This results in a perpetual series of physical manifestations and moral effects on Earth, during manvantaric periods,the whole being subservient to Karma. As that process is not always perfect; and since, however many proofs it may exhibit of aguiding intelligence behind the veil, it still shows gaps and flaws, and even results very often in evident failures -- therefore, neitherthe collective Host (Demiurgos), nor any of the working powers individually, are proper subjects for divine honours or worship. All areentitled to the grateful reverence of Humanity, however, and man ought to be ever striving to help the divine evolution of Ideas, bybecoming to the best of his ability a co-worker with nature in the cyclic task. The ever unknowable and incognizable Karana alone,the Causeless Cause of all causes, should have its shrine and altar on the holy and ever untrodden ground of our heart -- invisible,intangible, unmentioned, save through \"the still small voice\" of our spiritual consciousness. Those who worship before it, ought to doso in the silence and the sanctified solitude of their Souls*; making their spirit the sole mediator between them and the UniversalSpirit, their good actions the only priests, and their sinful intentions the only visible and objective sacrificial victims to the Presence.(See Part II., \"On the Hidden Deity.\")(4) Matter is Eternal. It is the Upadhi (the physical basis) for the One infinite Universal Mind to build thereon its ideations. Therefore,the Esotericists maintain that there is no inorganic or dead matter in nature, the distinction between the two made by Science beingas unfounded as it is arbitrary and devoid of reason.[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* \"When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are . . . but enter into thine inner chamber and having shut thy door, pray tothy Father which is in secret.\" Matt. vi.).

Having been endowed with the germs of becoming, matter(objective) is brought into birth, for the creative force fashions it according to the ideal forms. Matter not yet engendered had no form;it becomes when it is put into operation.\" (The Definitions of Asclepios, p. 134, \"Virgin of the World.\")\"Everything is the product of one universal creative effort. . . . There is nothing dead, in Nature. Everything is organic and living, andtherefore the whole world appears to be a living organism.\" (Paracelsus, \"Philosophia ad Athenienes,\" F. Hartmann's translations, p.44.)(5.) The Universe was evolved out of its ideal plan, upheld through Eternity in the unconsciousness of that which the Vedantins callParabrahm. This is practically identical with the conclusions of the highest Western Philosophy -- \"the innate, eternal, and self-existingIdeas\" of Plato, now reflected by Von Hartmann. The \"unknowable\" of Herbert Spencer bears only a faint resemblance to thattranscendental Reality believed in by Occultists, often appearing merely a personification of a \"force behind phenomena\" -- aninfinite and eternal Energy[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* To this the late Mrs. (Dr.) Kingsford, the able translator and compiler of the Hermetic Fragments (see \"The Virgin of the World\")remarks in a foot-note; \"Dr. Menard observes that in Greek the same word signifies to be born and to become. The idea here is thatthe material of the world is in its essence eternal, but that before creation or 'becoming' it is in a passive and motionless condition.Thus it 'was' before being put into operation; now it 'becomes,' that is, it is mobile and progressive.\" And she adds the purely Vedanticdoctrine of the Hermetic philosophy that \"Creation is thus the period of activity (Manvantara) of God, who, according to Hermeticthought (or which, according to the Vedantin) has two modes -- Activity or Existence, God evolved (Deus explicitus); and Passivity ofBeing (Pralaya) God involved (Deus implicitus). Both modes are perfect and complete, as are the waking and sleeping states of man.Fichte, the German philosopher, distinguished Being (Seyn) as One, which we know only through existence (Dasein) as the Manifold.This view is thoroughly Hermetic. The 'Ideal Forms' are the archetypal or formative ideas of the Neo-Platonists; the eternal andsubjective concepts of things subsisting in the divine mind prior to 'becoming'\" (p. 134).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 282 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.from which all things proceed, while the author of the \"Philosophy of the Unconscious\" has come (in this respect only) as near to asolution of the great Mystery as mortal man can. Few were those, whether in ancient or mediaeval philosophy, who have dared toapproach the subject or even hint at it. Paracelsus mentions it inferentially. His ideas are admirably synthesized by Dr. F. Hartmann,F.T.S., in his \"Life of Paracelsus.\"All the Christian Kabalists understood well the Eastern root idea: The active Power, the \"Perpetual motion of the great Breath\" onlyawakens Kosmos at the dawn of every new Period, setting it into motion by means of the two contrary Forces,* and thus causing it tobecome objective on the plane of Illusion. In other words, that dual motion transfers Kosmos from the plane of the Eternal Ideal intothat of finite manifestation, or from the Noumenal to the Phenomenal plane. Everything that is, was, and will be, eternally IS, eventhe countless forms, which are finite and perishable only in their objective, not in their ideal Form. They existed as Ideas, in theEternity,** and, when they pass away, will exist as reflections. Neither the form of man, nor that of any animal, plant or stone has everbeen created, and it is only on this plane of ours that it commenced \"becoming,\" i.e., objectivising into its present materiality, orexpanding from within outwards, from the most sublimated and supersensuous essence into its grossest appearance. Therefore ourhuman forms have existed in the Eternity as astral or ethereal prototypes; according to which models, the Spiritual Beings (or Gods)whose duty it was to bring them into objective being and terrestrial Life, evolved the protoplasmic forms of the future Egos from theirown essence. After which, when this human Upadhi, or basic mould was ready, the natural terrestrial Forces began to work on thosesupersensuous moulds which contained, besides their own, the elements of all the past vegetable and future animal forms of thisglobe in them.

This Primordial essence is of a monistic nature,and manifests itself not only as vital activity, a spiritual force, an invisible, incomprehensible, and indescribable power, but also asvital matter of which the substance of living beings consists.\" In this Ideos of primordial matter, or the proto-ilos -- which is the matrix ofall created things -- is contained the substance from which everything is formed. It is the Chaos . . . out of which the Macrocosm, and,later on, by evolution and division in Mysteria Specialia,* each separate being, came into existence. \"All things and all elementarysubstances were contained in it in potentia but not in actu\" -- which makes the translator, Dr. F. Hartmann, justly observe that \"it seemsthat Paracelsus anticipated the modern discovery of the 'potency of matter' three hundred years ago\" (P. 42).This Magnus Limbus, then, or Yliaster of Paracelsus, is simply our old friend \"Father-Mother,\" within, before it appeared in Space, ofthe second and other Stanzas. It is the universal matrix of Kosmos, personified in the dual character of Macro- and Microcosm (or theUniverse and our Globe)** by Aditi-Prakriti, the Spiritual and the physical nature. For we find it explained in Paracelsus that \"theMagnus Limbus is the nursery out of which all creatures have grown, in the same sense as a tree grows out of a small seed; with thedifference, however, that the great Limbus takes its origin from the Word, while the Limbus minor (the terrestrial seed or sperm) takes itfrom the earth.[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* This word is explained by Dr. Hartmann from the original texts of Paracelsus before him, as follows. According to this greatRosicrucian: \"Mysterium is everything out of which something may be developed, which is only germinally contained in it. A seed isthe 'Mysterium' of a plant, an egg that of a living bird, etc.\"** It is only the mediaeval Kabalists who, following the Jewish and one or two Neo-Platonists, applied the term Microcosm to man.Ancient philosophy called the Earth the Microcosm of the Macrocosm, and man the outcome of the two.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 284 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The great Limbus is the seed out of which all beings have come, and the little Limbus is each ultimate being that reproduces its form,and that has itself been produced by the 'great.' The latter possesses all the qualifications of the great one, in the same sense as a sonhas an organization similar to that of his father.\" (See Comment. Book II. para. iii.) . . . \"As Yliaster dissolved, Ares, the dividing,differentiating, and individualising power (Fohat, another old friend,) . . . began to act. All production took place in consequence ofseparation. There were produced out of the Ideos, the elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth, whose birth, however, did not take placein a material mode, or by simple separation,\" but by spiritual and dynamical, not even complex, combinations -- e.g., mechanicalmixture as opposed to chemical combination -- just as fire may come out of a pebble, or a tree out of a seed, although there isoriginally no fire in the pebble, nor a tree in the seed. Spirit is living, and Life is Spirit, and Life and Spirit (Prakriti Purusha) (?)produce all things, but they are essentially one and not two. . . . The elements too, have each one its own Yliaster, because all theactivity of matter in every form is only an effluvium of the same fount. But as from the seed grow the roots with their fibres, and afterthat the stalk with its branches and leaves, and lastly the flowers and seeds; likewise all beings were born from the elements, andconsist of elementary substances out of which other forms may come into existence, bearing the characteristics of their parents.\" (\"Thisdoctrine, preached 300 years ago,\" remarks the translator, \"is identical with the one that has revolutionized modern thought, afterhaving been put into new shape and elaborated by Darwin. It was still more elaborated by Kapila in the Sankhya philosophy\") . . . .The elements as the mothers of all creatures are of an invisible, spiritual nature, and have souls.* They all spring from the \"MysteriumMagnum.\" (Philosophia ad Athenienses.)Compare this with Vishnu Purana.\"From Pradhana (primordial substance) presided over by Kshetrajna (embodied Spirit?) proceeds the evolution of those qualities. . . .From the great Principle Mahat (Universal Intellect, or mind) . . . proceeds[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* The Eastern Occultist says -- \"are guided and informed by the Spiritual Beings\" the Workmen in the invisible worlds and behind theveil of Occult nature, or nature in Abscondito.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 285 HERMES CHRISTIANIZED.the origin of the subtle elements and from these the organs of sense (Book I., ii.)."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Thus it may be shown that all the fundamental truths of nature were universal in antiquity, and that the basic ideas upon spirit, matter,and the universe, or upon God, Substance, and man, were identical. Taking the two most ancient religious philosophies on the globe,Hinduism and Hermetism, from the scriptures of India and Egypt, the identity of the two is easily recognisable.This becomes apparent to one who reads the latest translation and rendering of the \"Hermetic Fragments\" just mentioned, by our latelamented friend, Dr. Anna Kingsford. Disfigured and tortured as these have been in their passage through Sectarian Greek andChristian hands, the translator has most ably and intuitionally seized the weak points and tried to remedy them by means ofexplanations and foot-notes. And she says:.......... The creation of the visible world by the 'working gods' or Titans, as agents of theSupreme God,* is a thoroughly Hermetic idea, recognisable in all religious systems, and in accordance with modern scientificresearch (?), which shows us everywhere the Divine power operating through natural Forces.\"\"That Universal Being, that contains all, and which is all, put into motion the Soul and the World, all that nature comprises, saysHermes. In the manifold unity of universal life, the innumerable individualities distinguished by their variations, are, nevertheless,united in such a manner that the whole is one, and that everything proceeds from Unity.\" (Asclepios, Part I.)\"God is not a mind, but the cause that the mind is; not a spirit, but the cause that the Spirit is; not light, but the cause that the Lightis.\" (Divine Pymander, Book IX., v. 64.)The above shows plainly that \"Divine Pyrnander,\" however much distorted in some passages by Christian \"smoothing,\" wasnevertheless written by a philosopher, while most of the so-called \"hermetic Fragments\" are the production of sectarian pagans with atendency towards an anthropomorphic Supreme Being. Yet both are the echo of the Esoteric philosophy and the Hindu Puranas.Compare two invocations, one to the Hermetic \"Supreme All,\" the[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* A frequent expression in the said Fragments, to which we take exception. The Universal Mind is not a Being or \"God.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 286 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.other to the \"Supreme All\" of the later Aryans. Says a Hermetic Fragment cited by Suidas (see Mrs. Kingsford's \"The Virgin of theWorld\"): -\"I adjure thee, Heaven, holy work of the great God; I adjure thee, Voice of the Father, uttered in the beginning when the universalworld was framed; I adjure thee by the word, only Son of the Father who upholds all things; be favourable, be favourable.\"This just preceded by the following: \"Thus the Ideal Light was before the Ideal Light, and the luminous Intelligence of Intelligencewas always, and its unity was nothing else than the Spirit enveloping the Universe. Out of whom is neither God nor Angels, nor anyother essentials, for He (It?) is the Lord of all things and the power and the Light; and all depends on Him (It) and is in Him (It), etc.\"(Fragments of the writings of Hermes to Ammon.)This is contradicted by the very same Trismegistos, who is made to say: \"To speak of God is impossible. For corporeal cannot expressthe incorporeal. . . . . That which has not any body nor appearance, nor form, nor matter, cannot be apprehended by sense. Iunderstand, Tatios, I understand, that which it is impossible to define -- that is God.\" (Physical Eclogues, Florilegium of Stobaeus.)The contradiction between the two passages is evident; and this shows (a) that Hermes was a generic nom-de-plume used by a seriesof generations of mystics of every shade, and (b) that a great discernment has to be used before accepting a Fragment as esotericteaching only because it is undeniably ancient. Let us now compare the above with a like invocation in the Hindu Scriptures --undoubtedly as old, if not far older. Here it is Parasara, the Aryan \"Hermes\" who instructs Maitreya, the Indian Asclepios, and callsupon Vishnu in his triple hypostasis.\"Glory to the unchangeable, holy, eternal Supreme Vishnu, of one universal nature, the mighty over all; to him who is Hiranyagarbha,Hari, and Sankara (Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva), the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer of the world; to Vasudeva, the liberator (ofhis worshippers); to him whose essence is both single and manifold; who is both subtile and corporeal, indiscreet and discreet; toVishnu the cause of final emancipation, the cause of the creation, existence, the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 287 ALONE THE ETERNAL IS REST.end of the world; who is the root of the world, and who consists of the world.\" (Vish. Purana, Book L.)This is a grand invocation, full of philosophical meaning underlying it; but, for the profane masses, as suggestive as is the first of ananthropomorphic Being. We must respect the feeling that dictated both; but we cannot help finding it in full disharmony with its innermeaning, even with that which is found in the same Hermetic treatise where it is said:"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"\"Reality is not upon the earth, my son, and it cannot be thereon. . . . Nothing on earth is real, there are only appearances. . . He (man)is not real, my son, as man. The real consists solely in itself and remains what it is. . . Man is transient, therefore he is not real, he isbut appearance, and appearance is the supreme illusion.Tatios: Then the celestial bodies themselves are not real, my father, since they also vary?Trismegistos: That which is subject to birth and to change is not real. . . . . There is in them a certain falsity, seeing that they too arevariable.......Tatios: And what then is the primordial Reality?Trismeg.: That which is one and alone, 0 Tatios; That which is not made of matter, nor in any body. Which has neither colour norform, which changes not nor is transmitted but which always is.\"This is quite consistent with the Vedantic teaching. The leading thought is Occult; and many are the passages in the HermeticFragments that belong bodily to the Secret Doctrine.The latter teaches that the whole universe is ruled by intelligent and semi-intelligent Forces and Powers, as stated from the verybeginning. Christian Theology admits and even enforces belief in such, but makes an arbitrary division and refers to them as \"Angels\"and \"Devils.\" Science denies the existence of such, and ridicules the very idea. Spiritualists believe in the Spirits of the Dead, and,outside these, deny entirely any other kind or class of invisible beings. The Occultists and Kabalists are thus the only rationalexpounders of the ancient traditions, which have now culminated in dogmatic faith on the one hand, and dogmatic denials on theother. For, both belief and unbelief embrace but one small corner each of the infinite horizons of spiritual and physicalmanifestations; and thus both are right from------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 288 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.their respective standpoints, and both are wrong in believing that they can circumscribe the whole within their own special and narrowbarriers; for -- they can never do so. In this respect Science, Theology, and even Spiritualism show little more wisdom than the ostrichdoes, when it hides its head in the sand at its feet, feeling sure that there can be thus nothing beyond its own point of observation andthe limited area occupied by its foolish head.As the only works now extant upon the subject under consideration within reach of the profane of the Western \"civilized\" races are theabove-mentioned Hermetic Books, or rather Hermetic Fragments, we may contrast them in the present case with the teachings ofEsoteric philosophy. To quote for this purpose from any other would be useless, since the public knows nothing of the Chaldean workswhich are translated into Arabic and preserved by some Sufi initiates. Therefore the \"Definitions of Asclepios,\" as lately compiled andglossed by Mrs. A. Kingsford, F.T.S., some of which sayings are in remarkable agreement with the Esoteric Eastern doctrine, have tobe resorted to for comparison. Though not a few passages show a strong impression of some later Christian hand, yet on the whole thecharacteristics of the genii* and gods are those of eastern teachings, while concerning other things there are passages which differwidely in our doctrines. The following are a few:--[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* The Hermetic philosophers called Theoi, gods, Genii and Daimones (in the original texts), those Entities whom we call Devas (gods),Dhyan Chohans, Chitkala (Kwan-yin, the Buddhists call them), and by other names. The Daimones are -- in the Socratic sense, andeven in the Oriental and Latin theological sense -- the guardian spirits of the human race; \"those who dwell in the neighbourhood ofthe immortals, and thence watch over human affairs,\" as Hermes has it. In Esoteric parlance, they are called Chitkala, some of whichare those who have furnished man with his fourth and fifth Principles from their own essence; and others the Pitris so-called. This willbe explained when we come to the production of the complete man. The root of the name is Chiti, \"that by which the effects andconsequences of actions and kinds of knowledge are selected for the use of the soul,\" or conscience the inner Voice in man. With theYogis, the Chiti is a synonym of Mahat, the first and divine intellect; but in Esoteric philosophy Mahat is the root of Chiti, its germ; andChiti is a quality of Manas in conjunction with Buddhi, a quality that attracts to itself by spiritual affinity a Chitkala when it developssufficiently in man. This is why it is said that Chiti is a voice acquiring mystic life and becoming Kwan-Yin.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 289 A FEW OCCULT APHORISMS.EXTRACTS FROM A PRIVATE COMMENTARY,* hitherto secret:--(xvii.) \"The Initial Existence in the first twilight of the Maha-Manwantara (after the MAHA-PRALAYA that follows every age of Brahma)is a CONSCIOUS SPIRITUAL QUALITY.

Around him, like an army of Satellites, areinnumerable choirs of genii. These dwell in the neighbourhood of the Immortals, and thence watch over human things. They fulfil thewill of the gods (Karma) by means of storms, tempests, transitions of fire and earthquakes; likewise by famines and wars, for thepunishment of impiety.* . . . It is the sun who preserves and nourishes all creatures; and even as the Ideal World which environs thesensible world fills this last with the plenitude and universal variety of forms, so also the Sun, enfolding all in his light, accomplisheseverywhere the birth and development of creatures.\" . . . \"Under his orders is the choir of Genii, or rather the choirs, for there are manyand diverse, and their number corresponds to that of the stars. Every star has its genii, good and evil by nature, or rather by theiroperation, for operation is the essence of the genii. . . . All these Genii preside over mundane affairs,** they shake and overthrow theconstitution of States and of individuals; they imprint their likeness on our Souls, they are present in our nerves, our marrow, our veins,our arteries, and our very brain-substance . . . at the moment when each of us receives life and being, he is taken in charge by thegenii (Elementals) who preside over births,*** and who are classed beneath the astral powers (Superhuman astral Spirits.) Theychange perpetually, not always identically, but revolving in circles.**** They permeate by the body two parts of the Soul, that it mayreceive from each the impress of his own energy.

That element which predominates ina certain constitution will be the ruling element throughout life. For instance, if man has a preponderance of the Earthly, gnomicelement, the gnomes will lead him towards assimilating metals -- money and wealth, and so on. \"Animal man is the son of the animalelements out of which his Soul (life) was born, and animals are the mirrors of man,\" says Paracelsus (De Fundamento Sapientiae).Paracelsus was cautious, and wanted the Bible to agree with what he said, and therefore did not say all.**** Cyclic progress in development.------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 1, Page]] 295 UNIVERSAL ILLUSION.for the reception of (the) God,* who enlightens it with a sunny ray.

But it is not againstmetaphysicians, but against physicists and materialists that Esoteric teachings have to fight, and for these Vital Force, Light, Sound,Electricity, even to the objectively pulling force of magnetism, have no objective being, and are said to exist merely as \"modes ofmotion,\" \"sensations and affections of matter.\"Neither the Occultists generally, nor the Theosophists, reject, as erroneously believed by some, the views and theories of the modernscientists, only because these views are opposed to Theosophy. The first rule of our Society is to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.The Theosophists, therefore, are the first to recognize the intrinsic value of science. But when its high priests resolve consciousnessinto a secretion from the grey matter of the brain, and everything else in nature into a mode of motion, we protest against the doctrineas being unphilosophical, self-contradictory, and simply absurd, from a scientific point of view, as much and even more than from theoccult aspect of the esoteric knowledge.For truly the astral light of the derided Kabalists has strange and weird secrets for him who can see in it; and the mysteries concealedwithin its incessantly disturbed waves are there, the whole body of Materialists and scoffers notwithstanding.* These secrets, along with[[Footnote(s) -------------------------------------------------]]* The astral light of the Kabalists is very incorrectly translated by some \"AEther;\" the latter is confused with the hypothetical Ether ofScience, and both are referred to by some theosophists as synonymous with Akasa. This is a great mistake.\"A characteristic of Akasa will serve to show how inadequately it is represented by Ether,\" writes the author of Rational Refutations,thus unconsciously helping Occultism. \"In dimension it is infinite; it is not made up of parts; and colour, taste, smell, and tangibility donot appertain to it. So far forth it corresponds exactly to time, space, Isvara, (\"The Lord,\" but rather creative potency and soul -- animamundi). Its speciality, as compared therewith, consists in its being the material cause of sound. Except for its being so, one might takeit to be one with vacuity\" (p. 120.)It is vacuity, no doubt, especially for Rationalists. At any rate Akasa is sure to produce vacuity in the brain of a materialist.Nevertheless, though Akasa is not that Ether of Science, not even the Ether of the Occultist, who defines the latter as one of theprinciples of Akasa only, it is as certainly, together with its primary, the cause of sound, only a physical and spiritual, not a materialcause by any means.

But, as a Columbus was born to re-discover, and to force the Old World to believein Antipodal countries, so will there be born scientists who will discover the marvels now claimed by Occultists to exist in the regions ofEther, with their varied and multiform denizens and conscious Entities. Then, nolens volens, Science will have to accept the old\"Superstition,\" as it has several others. And having been once forced to accept it -- judging from past experience -- its learnedprofessors will, in all probability, as in the case of MESMERISM and Magnetism, now re-baptised Hypnotism, father the thing andreject its name. The choice of the new appellation will depend, in its turn, on the \"modes of motion,\" the new name for the older\"automatic physical processes among the nerve fibrils of the (Scientific) brain\" of Moleschott; as also, very likely, upon the last meal ofthe namer; since, according to the Founder of the new Hylo-Idealistic Scheme, \"Cerebration is generically the same as chylification.\"*Thus, were one to believe this preposterous proposition, the new name of the archaic thing would have to take its chance, on theinspiration of the namer's liver, and then only would these truths have a chance of becoming scientific!But TRUTH, however distasteful to the generally blind majorities, has always had her champions, ready to die for her, and it is not theOccultists who will protest against its adoption by Science under whatever new name. But, until absolutely forced on the notice andacceptance of Scientists, many an Occult truth will be tabooed, as the phenomena of the Spiritualists and other psychicmanifestations were, to be finally appropriated by its ex-traducers without the least acknowledgment or thanks.

But if we look into history we shall clearly see that, although the origin of a new opinion may bethus due to a single man, the result which the new opinion produces will depend on the condition of the people among whom it ispropagated. If either a religion or a philosophy is too much in advance of a nation it can do no present service but must bide its time*until the minds of men are ripe for its reception. . . . Every science, every creed has had its martyrs. According to the ordinary course ofaffairs, a few generations pass away, and then there comes a period when these very truths are looked upon as commonplace facts,and a little later there comes another period in which they are declared to be necessary, and even the dullest intellect wonders howthey could ever have been denied.\"It is barely possible that the minds of the present generations are not quite ripe for the reception of Occult truths. Such will be theretrospect furnished to the advanced thinkers of the Sixth Root Race of the history of the acceptance of Esoteric Philosophy -- fully andunconditionally. Meanwhile the generations of our Fifth Race will continue to be led away by prejudice and preconceptions. OccultSciences will have the finger of scorn pointed at them from every street corner, and everyone will seek to ridicule and crush them inthe name, and for the greater glory, of Materialism and its so-called Science. The Addendum which completes the present Bookshows, however, in an anticipatory answer to several of the forthcoming Scientific objections, the true and mutual positions of thedefendant and plaintiff. The Theosophists and Occultists stand arraigned by public opinion, which still holds high the banner of theinductive Sciences. The latter have, then, to be examined; and it must be shown how far their achievements and discoveries in therealm of natural laws are opposed, not so much to our claims, as to the facts in nature. The hour has now struck to ascertain whetherthe[[Footnote(s)]]-------------------------------------------------* This is Cyclic law, but this law itself is often defied by human stubbornness.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 299 MEN WELCOME ERROR, AND CRUCIFY THE TRUTH.walls of the modern Jericho are so impregnable that no blast of the Occult trumpet is ever likely to make them crumble."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The so-called Forces, with Light and Electricity heading them, and the constitution of the Solar orb must be carefully examined; asalso Gravitation and the Nebular theories.

She is one of those who feel convinced that nomythological story, no traditional event in the folk-lore of a people has ever been, at any time, pure fiction, but that every one of suchnarratives has an actual, historical lining to it. In this the writer disagrees with those symbologists, however great their reputation, whofind in every myth nothing save additional proofs of the superstitious bent of mind of the ancients, and believe that all mythologiessprung from and are built upon solar myths. Such superficial thinkers were admirably disposed of by Mr. Gerald Massey, the poet andEgyptologist, in a lecture on \"Luniolatry, Ancient and Modern.\" His pointed criticism is worthy of reproduction in this part of this work,as it echoes so well our own feelings, expressed openly so far back as 1875, when \"Isis Unveiled\" was written.\"For thirty years past Professor Max Muller has been teaching in his books and lectures, in the Times and various magazines, from theplatform of the Royal Institution, the pulpit of Westminster Abbey, and his chair at Oxford, that mythology is a disease of language,and that the ancient symbolism was a result of something like a primitive aberration.\"'We know,' says Renouf, echoing Max Muller, in his Hibbert lectures, 'we know that mythology is the disease which springs up at apeculiar stage of human culture.' Such is the shallow explanation of the non-evolutionists, and such explanations are still accepted bythe British public, that gets its think-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 304 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.ing done by proxy. Professor Max Muller, Cox, Gubernatis, and other propounders of the Solar Mythos, have portrayed the primitivemyth-maker for us as a sort of Germanised-Hindu metaphysician, projecting his own shadow on a mental mist, and talking ingeniouslyconcerning smoke, or, at least, cloud; the sky overhead becoming like the dome of dreamland, scribbled over with the imagery ofaboriginal nightmares! They conceive the early man in their own likeness, and look upon him as perversely prone to self-mystification,or, as Fontenelle has it, 'subject to beholding things that are not there.' They have misrepresented primitive or archaic man as havingbeen idiotically misled from the first by an active but untutored imagination into believing all sorts of fallacies, which were directlyand constantly contradicted by his own daily experience; a fool of fancy in the midst of those grim realities that were grinding hisexperience into him, like the grinding icebergs making their imprints upon the rocks submerged beneath the sea. It remains to be said,and will one day be acknowledged, that these accepted teachers have been no nearer to the beginnings of mythology and languagethan Burns' poet Willie had been near to Pegasus. My reply is, 'Tis but a dream of the metaphysical theorist that mythology was adisease of language, or of anything else except his own brain. The origin and meaning of mythology have been missed altogether bythese solarites and weather-mongers! Mythology was a primitive mode of thinking the early thought. It was founded on natural facts,and is still verifiable in phenomena. There is nothing insane, nothing irrational in it, when considered in the light of evolution, andwhen its mode of expression by sign-language is thoroughly understood. The insanity lies in mistaking it for human history or DivineRevelation.* Mythology is the repository of man's most ancient science, and what concerns us chiefly is this -- when truly interpretedonce more, it is destined to be the death of those false theologies to which it has unwittingly given birth.** In modern phraseology astatement is sometimes said to be mythical in proportion to its being untrue; but the ancient mythology was not a system or mode offalsifying in that sense. Its fables were the means of conveying facts; they were neither forgeries nor fictions. . . . For example, whenthe Egyptians portrayed the moon as a Cat, they were not ignorant enough to suppose that the moon was a cat; nor did theirwandering fancies see any likeness in the moon to a cat; nor was a cat-myth any mere expansion of verbal metaphor; nor had theyany intention of making puzzles or riddles. . . . They had observed the simple fact that the cat saw in the dark, and that her eyesbecame full-orbed, and grew most luminous by night. The moon was the seer by night in heaven, and the cat was its equivalent onthe earth; and so the familiar cat was adopted as a representative, a natural sign, a living pictograph of the lunar orb. . . . And so it"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"followed that the sun which saw down in the under-world at night could also be called the cat, as it was, because it also saw in thedark. The name of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* As far as divine revelation is concerned, we agree. Not so with regard to \"human history.\" . . . For there is \"history\" in most of theallegories and \"myths\" of India, and events, real actual events, are concealed under them.** When the \"false theologies\" disappear, then true prehistoric realities will be found, contained especially in the mythology of theAryans -- ancient Hindoos, and even the pre-Homeric Hellenes.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 305 EMBLEM AND SYMBOL DIFFER.cat in Egyptian is mau, which denotes the seer, from mau, to see. One writer on mythology asserts that the Egyptians 'imagined agreat cat behind the sun, which is the pupil of the cat's eye.' But this imagining is all modern. It is the Mullerite stock in trade. Themoon as cat was the eye of the sun, because it reflected the solar light, and because the eye gives back image in its mirror. In theform of the goddess Pasht, the cat keeps watch for the sun, with her paw holding down and bruising the head of the serpent ofdarkness, called his eternal enemy. . . .\"This is a very correct exposition of the lunar-mythos from its astronomical aspect. Selenography, however, is the least esoteric of thedivisions of lunar Symbology. To master thoroughly -- if one is permitted to coin a new word -- Selenognosis, one must becomeproficient in more than its astronomical meaning. The moon (vide § VII. Deus Lunus) is intimately related to the Earth, as shown inStanza VI. of Book I., and is more directly concerned with all the mysteries of our globe than is even Venus-Lucifer, the occult sisterand alter-ego of the Earth.The untiring researches of Western, and especially German, symbologists, during the last and the present centuries, have broughtevery Occultist and most unprejudiced persons to see that without the help of symbology (with its seven departments, of which themoderns know nothing) no ancient Scripture can ever be correctly understood. Symbology must be studied from every one of itsaspects, for each nation had its own peculiar methods of expression. In short, no Egyptian papyrus, no Indian tolla, no Assyrian tile, orHebrew scroll, should be read and accepted literally.This every scholar now knows. The able lectures of Mr. G. Massey alone are sufficient in themselves to convince any fair-mindedChristian that to accept the dead-letter of the Bible is equivalent to falling into a grosser error and superstition than any hithertoevolved by the brain of the savage South Sea Islander. But the point to which even the most truth-loving and truth-searchingOrientalists -- whether Aryanists or Egyptologists -- seem to remain blind, is the fact that every symbol in papyrus or olla is a many-faced diamond, each of whose facets not merely bears several interpretations, but relates likewise to several sciences. This isinstanced in the just quoted interpretation of the moon symbolized by the cat -- an example of sidero-terrestrial imagery; the moonbearing many other meanings besides this with other nations.As a learned Mason and Theosophist, the late Mr. Kenneth Mackenzie, has shown in his Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia, there is a greatdifference between emblem and symbol. The former \"comprises a larger series of thoughts than a symbol, which may be said rather toillustrate some single special idea.\" Hence, the symbols (say lunar, or solar) of several countries, each illustrating such a special idea,or series of ideas, form collectively an esoteric emblem. The latter is \"a concrete visible------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 306 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.picture or sign representing principles, or a series of principles, recognizable by those who have received certain instructions\"(initiates). To put it still plainer, an emblem is usually a series of graphic pictures viewed and explained allegorically, and unfoldingan idea in panoramic views, one after the other. Thus the Puranas are written emblems. So are the Mosaic and Christian Testaments,or the Bible, and all other exoteric Scriptures. As the same authority shows:--\"All esoteric Societies have made use of emblems and symbols, such as the Pythagorean Society, the Eleusinian, the HermeticBrethren of Egypt, the Rosicrucians, and the Freemasons. Many of these emblems it is not proper to divulge to the general eye, and avery minute difference may make the emblem or symbol differ widely in its meaning. The magical sigillae, being founded on certainprinciples of numbers, partake of this character, and although monstrous or ridiculous in the eyes of the uninstructed, convey a wholebody of doctrine to those who have been trained to recognise them.\"The above enumerated societies are all comparatively modern, none dating back earlier than the middle ages. How much moreproper, then, that the students of the oldest Archaic School should be careful not to divulge secrets of far more importance tohumanity (in the sense of being dangerous in the hands of the latter) than any of the so-called \"Masonic Secrets,\" which have nowbecome, as the French say, those of \"Polichinelle!\" But this restriction can apply only to the psychological or rather psycho-physiological and Cosmical significance of symbol and emblem, and even to that only partially. An adept must refuse to impart theconditions and means that lead to a correlation of elements, whether psychic or physical, that may produce a hurtful result as well asa beneficent one. But he is ever ready to impart to the earnest student the secret of the ancient thought in anything that regardshistory concealed under mythological symbolism, and thus to furnish a few more land-marks towards a retrospective view of the past,as containing useful information with regard to the origin of man, the evolution of the races and geognosy; yet it is the crying"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"complaint of to-day, not only among theosophists, but also among the few profane interested in the subject. \"Why do not the adeptsreveal that which they know?\" To this, one might answer, \"Why should they, since one knows beforehand that no man of science willaccept, even as an hypothesis, let alone as a theory or axiom, the facts imparted.

Notwithstanding such an unenviable prospect, a mass of facts is given in thepresent work. And now the origin of man, the evolution of the globe and------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 307 MAGIC POTENCY OF SOUND.the races, human and animal, are as fully treated here as the writer is able to treat them.The proofs brought forward in corroboration of the old teachings are scattered widely throughout the old scriptures of ancientcivilizations. The Puranas, the Zendavesta, and the old classics are full of them; but no one has ever gone to the trouble of collectingand collating together those facts. The reason for this is, that all such events were recorded symbolically; and that the best scholars,the most acute minds, among our Aryanists and Egyptologists, have been too often darkened by one or another preconception; stilloftener, by one-sided views of the secret meaning. Yet even a parable is a spoken symbol: a fiction or a fable, as some think; anallegorical representation, we say, of life-realities, events, and facts. And, as a moral was ever drawn from a parable, that moral beingan actual truth and fact in human life, so an historical, real event was deduced -- by those versed in the hieratic sciences -- fromcertain emblems and symbols recorded in the ancient archives of the temples. The religious and esoteric history of every nation wasembedded in symbols; it was never expressed in so many words. All the thoughts and emotions, all the learning and knowledge,revealed and acquired, of the early races, found their pictorial expression in allegory and parable. Why? Because the spoken word hasa potency unknown to, unsuspected and disbelieved in, by the modern \"sages.\" Because sound and rhythm are closely related to thefour Elements of the Ancients; and because such or another vibration in the air is sure to awaken corresponding powers, union withwhich produces good or bad results, as the case may be. No student was ever allowed to recite historical, religious, or any real eventsin so many unmistakable words, lest the powers connected with the event should be once more attracted. Such events were narratedonly during the Initiation, and every student had to record them in corresponding symbols, drawn out of his own mind and examinedlater by his master, before they were finally accepted. Thus was created in time the Chinese Alphabet, as, before that, the hieraticsymbols were fixed upon in old Egypt. In the Chinese language, the alphabet of which may be read in any language,* and which isonly a little less ancient than the Egyptian alphabet of Thoth, every word has its corresponding symbol conveying the word needed ina pictorial form. The language possesses many thousands of such symbol letters, or logograms, each meaning a whole word; forletters proper, or an alphabet, do not exist in the Chinese language any more than they did in the Egyptian till a far later period.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Thus, a Japanese who does not understand one word of Chinese, meeting with a Chinaman who has never heard the language ofthe former, will communicate in writing with him, and they will understand each other perfectly -- because the writing is symbolical.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 308 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The explanation of the chief symbols and emblems is now attempted, as Book II., which treats of Anthropogenesis, would be mostdifficult to understand without a preparatory acquaintance with the metaphysical symbols at least.Nor would it be just to enter upon an esoteric reading of symbolism without giving due honour to one who has rendered it the greatestservice in this century, by discovering the chief key to ancient Hebrew symbology, interwoven strongly with metrology, one of the keysto the once universal mystery language. Mr. Ralston Skinner, of Cincinnati, the author of \"The Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery and theSource of Measures\" has our thanks. A mystic and a Kabalist by nature, he has laboured for many years in this direction, and his effortswere certainly crowned with great success. In his own words:--\"The writer is quite certain that there was an ancient language which modernly and up to this time appears to have been lost, thevestiges of which, however, abundantly exist. . . . The author discovered that this (integral ratio in numbers of diameter tocircumference of a circle) geometrical ratio was the very ancient, and probably the divine origin of linear measures. . . . It appearsalmost proven that the same system of geometry, numbers, ratio, and measures were known and made use of on the continent ofNorth America, even prior to the knowledge of the same by the descending Semites. . . . .\"\"The peculiarity of this language was that it could be contained in another, concealed and not to be perceived, save through the helpof special instruction; letters and syllabic signs possessing at the same time the powers or meaning of numbers, of geometrical shapes,pictures, or ideographs and symbols, the designed scope of which would be determinatively helped out by parables in the shape ofnarratives or parts of narratives; while also it could be set forth separately, independently, and variously, by pictures, in stone work, orin earth construction.\"\"To clear up an ambiguity as to the term language: Primarily the word means the expression of ideas by human speech; but,secondarily, it may mean the expression of ideas by any other instrumentality. This old language is so composed in the Hebrew text,that by the use of the written characters, which will be the language first defined, a distinctly separated series of ideas may beintentionally communicated, other than those ideas expressed by the reading of the sound signs. This secondary language sets forth,under a veil, series of ideas, copies in imagination of things sensible, which may be pictured, and of things which may be classed as"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"real without being sensible; as, for instance, the number 9 may be taken as a reality, though it has no sensible existence, so also arevolution of the moon, as separate from the moon itself by which that revolution has been made, may be taken as giving rise to, orcausing a real idea, though such a revolution has no substance. This idea-language may consist of symbols restricted to arbitraryterms and signs, having a very limited range of conceptions, and quite valueless, or it may be a reading of nature in some of hermanifestations of a value almost immeasurable, as regards human civilization. A picture of something natural may give rise to ideasof co-ordina-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 309 MYSTERY LANGUAGE.tive subject-matter, radiating out in various and even opposing directions, like the spokes of a wheel, and producing natural realitiesin departments very foreign to the apparent tendency of the reading of the first or starting picture. Notion may give rise to connectednotion, but if it does, then, however apparently incongruous, all resulting ideas must spring from the original picture and beharmonically connected, or related. . . . Thus with a pictured idea radical enough, the imagination of the Cosmos itself even in itsdetails of construction might result. Such a use of ordinary language is now obsolete, but it has become a question with the writerwhether at one time, far back in the past, it, or such, was not the language of the world and of universal use, possessed, however, as itbecame more and more moulded into its arcane forms, by a select class or caste. By this I mean that the popular tongue or vernacularcommenced even in its origin to be made use of as the vehicle of this peculiar mode of conveying ideas. Of this the evidences arevery strong; and, indeed, it would seem that in the history of the human race there happened, from causes which at present, at anyrate, we cannot trace, a lapse or loss from an original perfect language and a perfect system of science -- shall we say perfect becausethey were of divine origin and importation?\"\"Divine origin\" does not mean here a revelation from an anthropomorphic god on a mount amidst thunder and lightning; but, as weunderstand it, a language and a system of science imparted to the early mankind by a more advanced mankind, so much higher as tobe divine in the sight of that infant humanity. By a \"mankind,\" in short, from other spheres; an idea which contains nothingsupernatural in it, but the acceptance or rejection of which depends upon the degree of conceit and arrogance in the mind of him towhom it is stated. For, if the professors of modern knowledge would only confess that, though they know nothing of the future of thedisembodied man -- or rather will accept nothing -- yet this future may be pregnant with surprises and unexpected revelations to them,once their Egos are rid of their gross bodies -- then materialistic unbelief would have fewer chances than it has. Who of them knows, orcan tell, what may happen when once the life cycle of this globe is run down and our mother earth herself falls into her last sleep?Who is bold enough to say that the divine Egos of our mankind -- at least the elect out of the multitudes passing on to other spheres --will not become in their turn the \"divine\" instructors of a new mankind generated by them on a new globe, called to life and activityby the disembodied \"principles\" of our Earth? (See Stanza VI., Book I., Part 1.) All this may have been the experience of the PAST,and these strange records lie embedded in the \"Mystery language\" of the prehistoric ages, the language now called SYMBOLISM.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 310 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.§ II.THE MYSTERY LANGUAGE AND ITS KEYS.RECENT discoveries made by great mathematicians and Kabalists thus prove, beyond a shadow of doubt, that every theology, fromthe earliest and oldest down to the latest, has sprung not only from a common source of abstract beliefs, but from one universalesoteric, or \"Mystery\" language. These scholars hold the key to the universal language of old, and have turned it successfully, thoughonly once, in the hermetically closed door leading to the Hall of Mysteries. The great archaic system known from prehistoric ages asthe sacred Wisdom Science, one that is contained and can be traced in every old as well as in every new religion, had, and still has,its universal language -- suspected by the Mason Ragon -- the language of the Hierophants, which has seven \"dialects,\" so to speak,each referring, and being specially appropriated, to one of the seven mysteries of Nature. Each had its own symbolism. Nature couldthus be either read in its fulness, or viewed from one of its special aspects.The proof of this lies, to this day, in the extreme difficulty which the Orientalists in general, the Indianists and Egyptologistsespecially, experience in interpreting the allegorical writings of the Aryans and the hieratic records of old Egypt. This is because theywill never remember that all the ancient records were written in a language which was universal and known to all nations alike in daysof old, but which is now intelligible only to the few. Like the Arabic figures which are plain to a man of whatever nation, or like theEnglish word and, which becomes et for the Frenchman, und for the German, and so on, yet which may be expressed for all civilizednations in the simple sign & -- so all the words of that mystery language signified the same thing to each man of whatever nationality.There have been several men of note who have tried to re-establish such a universal and philosophical tongue: Delgarme, Wilkins,Leibnitz; but Demaimieux, in his Pasigraphie, is the only one who has proven its possibility. The scheme of Valentinius, called the\"Greek Kabala,\" based on the combination of Greek letters, might serve as a model.The many-sided facets of the mystery language have led to the adoption of widely varied dogmas and rites in the exotericism of theChurch rituals. It is they, again, which are at the origin of most of the dogmas of the Christian Church, e.g., the seven Sacraments, theTrinity, the Resurrection; the seven capital Sins and the seven Virtues. The seven keys to the mystery tongue, however, having alwaysbeen in------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 1, Page]] 311 EGYPT'S MANY RELIGIONS.the keeping of the highest among the initiated Hierophants of antiquity, it is only the partial use of a few out of the seven whichpassed, through the treason of some early Church Fathers -- ex-initiates of the Temples -- into the hands of the new sect of theNazarenes. Some of the early Popes were Initiates, but the last fragments of their knowledge have now fallen into the power of theJesuits, who have turned them into a system of sorcery.It is maintained that INDIA (not in its present limits, but including its ancient boundaries) is the only country in the world which still hasamong her sons adepts, who have the knowledge of all the seven sub-systems and the key to the entire system. Since the fall ofMemphis, Egypt began to lose those keys one by one, and Chaldea had preserved only three in the days of Berosus. As for theHebrews, in all their writings they show no more than a thorough knowledge of the astronomical, geometrical and numerical systemsof symbolizing all the human, and especially the physiological functions. They never had the higher keys.\"Every time I hear people talking of the religion of Egypt,\" writes M. Gaston Maspero, the great French Egyptologist and the successorof Mariette Bey, \"I am tempted to ask which of the Egyptian religions they are talking about? Is it of the Egyptian religion of the 4thDynasty, or of the Egyptian religion of the Ptolemaic period? Is it of the religion of the rabble, or of that of the learned men? Of thatwhich was taught in the schools of Heliopolis, or of that other which was in the minds and conceptions of the Theban sacerdotal class?For, between the first tomb of Memphis, which bears the cartouche of a king of the third dynasty, and the last stones at Esneh underCaesar-Philippus, the Arabian, there is an interval of at least five thousand years. Leaving aside the invasion of the Shepherds, theEthiopian and Assyrian dominions, the Persian conquest, Greek colonization, and the thousand revolutions of its political life, Egypthas passed during those five thousand years through many vicissitudes of life, moral and intellectual. Chapter XVII. of the Book of theDead which seems to contain the exposition of the system of the world as it was understood at Heliopolis during the time of the firstdynasties, is known to us only by a few copies of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties. Each of the verses composing it was already atthe time interpreted in three or four different ways; so different, indeed, that according to this or another school, the Demiurgebecame the solar fire -- Ra-shoo, or the primordial water. Fifteen centuries later, the number of readings had increased considerably.Time had, in its course, modified the ideas about the universe and the forces that ruled it. During the hardly 18 centuries thatChristianity exists, it has worked,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 312 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.developed and transformed most of its dogmas; how many times, then, might not the Egyptian clergy have altered its dogmas duringthose fifty centuries that separate Theodosius from the King Builders of the Pyramids?\"Here we believe the eminent Egyptologist is going too far. The exoteric dogmas may often have been altered, the esoteric never. Hedoes not take into account the sacred immutability of the primitive truths, revealed only during the mysteries of initiation. TheEgyptian priests have forgotten much, they altered nothing. The loss of a good deal of the primitive teaching was due to the suddendeaths of the great Hierophants, who passed away before they had time to reveal all to their successors; mostly, to the absence ofworthy heirs to the knowledge. Yet they have preserved in their rituals and dogmas the principal teachings of the secret doctrine.Thus, in the seventeenth chapter mentioned by Maspero, one finds (1) Osiris saying he is Toum (the creative force in nature, givingform to all Beings, spirits and men), self-generated and self-existent, issued from Noun, the celestial river, called Father-mother of thegods, the primordial deity, which is chaos or the Deep, impregnated by the unseen spirit. (2) He has found Shoo (solar force) on thestaircase in the City of the Eight (the two cubes of good and Evil), and he has annihilated the evil principles in Noun (chaos) thechildren of Rebellion. (3) He is the Fire and Water, i.e., Noun the primordial parent, and he created the gods out of his limbs -- 14gods (twice seven) seven dark and seven light gods (the seven Spirits of the Presence of the Christians and the Seven dark Evil Spirits).(4) He is the Law of existence and Being (v. 10), the Bennoo (or phoenix, the bird of resurrection in Eternity), in whom night followsthe day, and day the night -- an allusion to the periodical cycles of cosmic resurrection and human re-incarnation; for what can thismean? \"The wayfarer who crosses millions of years, in the name of One, and the great green (primordial water or Chaos) the name ofthe other\" (v. 17), one begetting millions of years in succession, the other engulfing them, to restore them back. (5) He speaks of theSeven Luminous ones who follow their Lord, who confers justice (Osiris in Amenti).All this is now shown to have been the source and origin of Christian dogmas. That which the Jews had from Egypt, through Mosesand other initiates, was confused and distorted enough in later days; and that which the Church got from both, is still moremisinterpreted.Yet their system is now proven identical in this special department of symbology -- the key, namely, to the mysteries of astronomy asconnected with those of generation and conception -- with those ideas of ancient religions, the theology of which has developed thephallic element. The Jewish system of sacred measures applied to religious symbols is the same,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 313 THE JEWS, AND THEIR SYSTEM.so far as geometrical and numerical combinations go, as those of Chaldea, Greece, and Egypt, having been adopted by the Jewsduring the centuries of their slavery and captivity with those nations.* What was that system? It is the intimate conviction of the authorof \"The Source of Measures\" that \"the Mosaic Books were intended, by a mode of art speech, to set forth a geometrical and numericalsystem of exact science, which should serve as an origin of measures.\" Piazzi Smyth believes likewise. This system and thesemeasures are found by some scholars to be identical with those used in the construction of the great pyramid -- but this is only partiallyso. \"The foundation of these measures was the Parker ratio,\" says Mr. R. Skinner, in \"The Source of Measures.\""},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The author of this very extraordinary work has found it out, he says, in the use of the integral ratio in numbers of diameter tocircumference of a circle, discovered by John Parker, of New York. This ratio is 6,561 for diameter, and 20,612 for circumference.Furthermore, that this geometrical ratio was the very ancient (and probably) the divine origin of what have now become throughexoteric handling and practical application the British linear measures, \"the underlying unit of which, viz., the inch, was likewise thebase of one of the royal Egyptian cubits and of the Roman foot. He also found out that there was a modified form of the ratio, viz.,113-355 (explained in his work); and that while this last ratio pointed through its origin to the exact integral pi, or to 6,561 to 20,612,it also served as a base for astronomical calculations. The author discovered that a system of exact science, geometrical, numerical,and astronomical, founded on these ratios and to be found in use in the construction of the Great Egyptian Pyramid, was in part theburden of this language as contained in, and concealed under, the verbiage of the Hebrew text of the Bible. The inch and the two-foot rule of 24 inches interpreted for use through the elements of the circle (see first pages of Book I.) and the ratios mentioned, werefound to be at the basis or foundation of this natural and Egyptian and Hebrew system of science, while, moreover, it seems evidentenough that the system itself was looked upon as of divine origin and of divine revela-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* As we said in Isis (Vol. II. p. 438-9), \"To the present moment, in spite of all controversies and researches, History and Science remainas much as ever in the dark as to the origin of the Jews. They may be as well the exiled Tchandalas of old India, the 'bricklayers'mentioned by Vina-Svata, Veda-Vyasa and Manu, as the Phoenicians of Herodotus, or the Hyk-Sos of Josephus, or descendants ofPali shepherds, or a mixture of all these. The Bible names the Tyrians as a kindred people, and claims dominion over them. . . . Yetwhatever they may have been, they became a hybrid people, not long after Moses, as the Bible shows them freely intermarrying notalone with the Canaanites, but with every other nation or race they came in contact with.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 314 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.tion. . . .\" But let us see what is said by the opponents of Prof. Piazzi Smyth's measurements of the Pyramid.Mr. Petrie seems to deny them, and to have made short work altogether of Piazzi Smyth's calculations in their Biblical connection. Sodoes Mr. Proctor, the champion \"Coincidentalist\" for many years past in every question of ancient arts and sciences. Speaking of \"themultitude of relations independent of the Pyramid, which have turned up while the Pyramidalists have been endeavouring to connectthe pyramid with the solar system . . . . these coincidences,\" he says, \"are altogether more curious than any coincidence between thePyramid and astronomical numbers: the former are as close and remarkable as they are real\" (i.e., those \"coincidences\" that wouldremain if even the pyramid had no existence); \"the latter which are only imaginary (?) have only been established by the processwhich schoolboys call 'fudging,' and now new measures have left the work to be done all over again\" (Petrie's letter to the Academy,Dec. 17, 1881.) To this Mr. Staniland Wake justly observes in his work on \"The Origin and Significance of the Great Pyramid\"(London, 1882): \"They must, however, have been more than mere coincidences, if the builders of the Pyramid had the astronomicalknowledge displayed in its perfect orientation and in its other admitted astronomical features.\"They had it; and it is on this \"knowledge\" that the programme of the MYSTERIES and of the series of Initiations was based: thence,the construction of the Pyramids, the everlasting record and the indestructible symbol of these Mysteries and Initiations on Earth, asthe courses of the stars are in Heaven. The cycle of Initiation was a reproduction in miniature of that great series of Cosmic changes towhich astronomers have given the name of tropical or sidereal year. Just as, at the close of the cycle of the sidereal year [25,868years], the heavenly bodies return to the same relative positions as they occupied at its outset, so at the close of the cycle of Initiationthe inner man has regained the pristine state of divine purity and knowledge from which he set out on his cycle of terrestrialincarnation.Moses, an Initiate into the Egyptian Mystagogy, based the religious mysteries of the new nation which he created, upon the sameabstract formula derived from this sidereal cycle, which he symbolised under the form and measurements of the tabernacle, that he issupposed to have constructed in the wilderness. On these data, the later Jewish High Priests constructed the allegory of Solomon'sTemple -- a building which never had a real existence, any more than had King Solomon himself, who is simply, and as much a solarmyth as is the still later Hiram Abif, of the Masons, as Ragon has well demonstrated. Thus, if the measurements of this allegoricaltemple, the symbol of the cycle of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 315 PIAZZA SMYTH AND PETRIE DISAGREE.Initiation, coincide with those of the Great Pyramid, it is due to the fact that the former were derived from the latter through theTabernacle of Moses.That our author has undeniably discovered one and even two of the keys is fully demonstrated in the work just quoted. One has but toread it to feel a growing conviction that the hidden meaning of the allegories and parables of both Testaments is now unveiled. Butthat he owes this discovery far more to his own genius than to Parker and Piazzi Smyth, is as certain, if not more so. For, as just shown,whether the measures of the great Pyramid taken and adopted as the correct ones by the Biblical \"Pyramidalists\" are beyondsuspicion, is not so sure. A proof of this is the work called \"The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh,\" by Mr. F. Petrie, besides other workswritten quite recently to oppose the said calculations, which were called biassed. We gather that nearly every one of Piazzi Smyth'smeasurements differs from the later and more carefully made measurements of Mr. Petrie, who concludes the Introduction to his workwith this sentence:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"\"As to the results of the whole investigation, perhaps many theories will agree with an American who was a warm believer in Pyramidtheories when he came to Gizeh. I had the pleasure of his company there for a couple of days, and at our last meal together he saidto me in a saddened tone -- 'Well, Sir! I feel as if I had been to a funeral. By all means let the old theories have a decent burial,though we should take care that in our haste none of the wounded ones are buried alive.'\"As regards the late J. Parker's calculation in general, and his third proposition especially, we have consulted some eminentmathematicians, and this is the substance of what they say:Parker's reasoning rests on sentimental, rather than mathematical, considerations, and is logically inconclusive.Proposition III., namely, that --\"The circle is the natural basis or beginning of all area, and the square being made so in mathematical science, is artificial andarbitrary --\"-- is an illustration of an arbitrary proposition, and cannot safely be relied upon in mathematical reasoning. The same observationapplies, even more strongly, to Proposition VII., which states that:\"Because the circle is the primary shape in nature, and hence the basis of area; and because the circle is measured by, and is equalto the square only in ratio of half its circumference by the radius, therefore, circumference and radius, and not the square of diameter,are the only natural and legitimate elements of area, by which all regular shapes are made equal to the square, and equal to thecircle.\"Proposition IX. is a remarkable example of faulty reasoning, and it is the one on which Mr. Parker's Quadrature mainly rests. Here it is:--------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 316 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"The circle and the equilateral triangle are opposite to one another in all the elements of their construction, and hence the fractionaldiameter of one circle, which is equal to the diameter of one square, is in the opposite duplicate ratio to the diameter of anequilateral triangle whose area is one,\" etc., etc.Granting, for the sake of argument, that a triangle can be said to have a radius in the sense in which we speak of the radius of a circle,-- for what Parker calls the radius of the triangle is the radius of a circle inscribed in the triangle and therefore not the radius of thetriangle at all, -- and granting for the moment the other fanciful and mathematical propositions united in his premises, why must weconclude that if the triangle and circle are opposite in all the elements of their construction, the diameter of any defined circle is inthe opposite duplicate ratio of the diameter of any given equivalent triangle? What necessary connection is there between thepremises and the conclusion? The reasoning is of a kind not known in geometry, and would not be accepted by strict mathematicians.Whether the Archaic esoteric system originated the British inch or not, is of little consequence, however, to the strict and truemetaphysician. Nor does Mr. Ralston Skinner's esoteric reading of the Bible become incorrect, merely because the measurements ofthe Pyramid will not be found to agree with those of Solomon's temple, the ark of Noah, etc.; or because Mr. Parker's Quadrature ofthe Circle is rejected by mathematicians. For Mr. Skinner's reading depends first of all on the Kabalistic methods and the Rabbinicalvalue of the Hebrew letters. But it is extremely important to ascertain whether the measures used in the evolution and building of theAryan symbolic religion, in the construction of their temples, the figures given in the Puranas, and especially in their chronology, theirastronomical symbols, the duration of the cycles, and other computations, were, or were not, the same as those used in the Biblicalmeasurements and glyphs. For this will prove that the Jews, unless they took their sacred cubit and measurements from the Egyptians(Moses being an initiate of the Priests) must have got those notions from India. At any rate they passed them to the early Christians.Hence, it is the Occultists and Kabalists who are the \"true\" heirs to the KNOWLEDGE, or the secret wisdom which is still found in theBible; for they alone now understand its real meaning, whereas profane Jews and Christians cling to the husks and dead letter thereof.That it is the system of measures which led to the invention of the God-names Elohim and Jehovah, and their adaptation tophallicism, and that Jehovah is a not very flattered copy of Osiris, is now demonstrated by the author of the \"Source of Measures.\" Butthe latter and Mr. Piazzi Smyth both seem to labour under the impression that (a) the priority of the system belongs to the Israelites,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 317 TRUTH MUST PREVAIL AT LAST.the Hebrew language being the divine language, and that (b) this universal language belongs to direct revelation!The latter hypothesis is correct only in the sense shown in the last paragraph of the preceding §; but we have yet to agree as to thenature and character of the divine \"Revealer.\" With regard to priority, this, to the profane, will of course depend on (a) the internal andexternal evidence of the revelation, and (b) on each scholar's individual preconception. This, however, cannot prevent either thetheistic Kabalist, or the Pantheistic Occultist, from believing each in his way; neither of the two convincing the other. The datafurnished by history are too meagre and unsatisfactory for either of them to prove to the sceptic which of them is right."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"On the other hand, the proofs afforded by tradition are too constantly rejected for us to hope to settle the question in our present age.Meanwhile, materialistic science will be laughing impartially at both Kabalists and Occultists. But the said vexed question of priorityonce laid aside, Science, in its departments of philology and comparative religion, will find itself finally taken to task, and becompelled to admit the common claim.* Its greatest scholars, instead of pooh-poohing that supposed[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* One by one the claims become admitted, as one Scientist after another is compelled to recognize the facts given out from theSecret Doctrine -- though he rarely, if ever, recognizes that he has been anticipated in his statements. Thus, in the palmy days of Mr.Piazzi Smyth's authority on the Pyramid of Gizeh, his theory was, that the porphyry sarcophagus of the King's Chamber \"is the unit ofmeasure for the two most enlightened nations of the earth, England and America,\" and was no better than a \"corn bin.\" This wasvehemently denied by us in Isis Unveiled just published at that time. Then the New York press arose in arms (the \"Sun\" and the\"World\" chiefly) against our presuming to correct or find fault with such a star of learning. On p. 519, vol. I., we had said, thatHerodotus when treating of that Pyramid \"might have added that, externally it symbolized the creative principle of Nature, andillustrated also the principles of geometry, mathematics, astrology, and astronomy. Internally, it was a majestic fane, in whose sombrerecesses were performed the mysteries, and whose walls had often witnessed the initiation-scenes of members of the royal family. Theporphyry sarcophagus, which Professor Piazzi Smyth, Astronomer Royal of Scotland, degrades into a corn-bin, was the baptismal font,upon emerging from which the neophyte was \"born again\" and became an adept.\"Our statement was laughed at in those days. We were accused of having got our ideas from the \"craze\" of Shaw, an English writer whohad maintained that the Sarcophagus had been used for the celebration of the Mysteries of Osiris; (we had never heard of thatwriter!). And now, six or seven years later, this is what Mr. Staniland Wake writes on p. 93 of his paper, on \"The Origin andSignificance of the Great Pyramid.\"\"The so-called King's Chamber, of which an enthusiastic pyramidist says, 'The polished walls, fine materials, grand proportions, andexalted place, eloquently tell of glories yet to come -- if not, the chamber of perfections of Cheops' tomb, was probably the place towhich the initiant was admitted after he had passed through the narrow upward passage and the grand gallery, with its lowlytermination, which gradually prepared him for the [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 318 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"farrago of absurd fiction and superstitions,\" as the Brahminical literature is generally termed, will endeavour to learn the symbolicaluniversal language with its numerical and geometrical keys. But here again they will hardly be successful if they share the belief thatthe Jewish Kabalistic system contains the key to the whole mystery: for, it does not. Nor does any other Scripture at present possess itin its entirety, for even the Vedas are not complete. Every old religion is but a chapter or two of the entire volume of archaic primevalmysteries -- Eastern Occultism alone being able to boast that it is in possession of the full secret, with its seven keys. Comparisons willbe instituted, and as much as possible will be explained in this work -- the rest is left to the student's personal intuition. For in sayingthat Eastern Occultism has the secret, it is not as if a \"complete\" or even an approximate knowledge was claimed by the writer, whichwould be absurd. What I know, I give out; that which I cannot explain, the student must find out for himself.But while supposing that the whole cycle of the universal mystery language will not be mastered for whole centuries to come, eventhat which has been hitherto discovered in the Bible by some scholars is quite sufficient to demonstrate the claim -- mathematically.Judaism having availed itself of two keys out of the seven, and these two keys having been now rediscovered, it becomes no longer amatter of individual speculation and hypothesis, least of all of \"coincidence,\" but one of a correct reading of the Bible texts, asanyone acquainted with arithmetic reads and verifies an addition or total.* A few years longer and this system will kill the dead letterof the Bible, as it will that of all the other exoteric faiths, by showing the dogmas in their real, naked meaning.And then this undeniable meaning, however incomplete, will unveil the mystery of Being, besides changing entirely the modernscientific systems of Anthropology, Ethnology and especially that of Chronology. The element of Phallicism, found in every God-name and narrative in the Old (and to some degree in the New) Testament, may also in time considerably change modernmaterialistic views in Biology and Physiology.Divested of their modern repulsive crudeness, such views of nature and man, on the authority of the celestial bodies and theirmysteries,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] final stage of the SACRED MYSTERIES.\" Had Mr. Staniland Wake been a Theosophist, hemight have added that the narrow upward passage leading to the King's chamber had a \"narrow gate\" indeed; the same \"strait gate\"which \"leadeth unto life,\" or the new spiritual re-birth alluded to by Jesus in Matthew vii. 13 et seq; and that it is this gate in theInitiation temple, that the writer who recorded the words alleged to have been spoken by an Initiate, was thinking of.* All we have said in Isis is now found corroborated in the \"Egyptian Mystery; or The Source of Measures,\" by those readings of theBible with the numerical and geometrical keys thereto.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 319 MOSES COPIED FROM SARGON."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"will unveil the evolutions of the human mind and show how natural was such a course of thought. The so-called phallic symbols havebecome offensive only because of the element of materiality and animality in them. As they originated with the archaic races, which,issuing to their personal knowledge from an androgyne ancestry, were the first phenomenal manifestations in their own sight of theseparation of sexes and the ensuing mystery of creating in their turn -- such symbols were but natural. If later races have degradedthem, especially the \"chosen people,\" this does not affect the origin of those symbols. The little Semitic tribe -- one of the smallestbranchlets from the commingling of the 4th and 5th sub-races (the Mongolo-Turanian and the Indo-European, so-called, after thesinking of the great Continent) -- could only accept its symbology in the spirit which was given to it by the nations from which it wasderived. Perchance, in the Mosaic beginnings, that symbology was not as crude as it became later under the handling of Ezra, whoremodelled the whole Pentateuch. For the glyph of Pharaoh's daughter (the woman), the Nile (the Great Deep and Water), and thebaby-boy found floating therein in the ark of rushes, has not been primarily composed for, or by, Moses. It has been found anticipatedin the Babylonian fragments on the tiles, in the story of King Sargon,* who lived far earlier than Moses. Now, what is the logicalinference? Most assuredly that which gives us the right to say that the story told of Moses by Ezra had been learned by him while atBabylon,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* On page 224 of Assyrian Antiquities Mr. George Smith says: \"In the palace of Sennacherib at Kouyunjik I found another fragment ofthe curious history of Sargon. . . . published in my translation in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. I. part I.p. 46.\" The capital of Sargon, the Babylonian Moses, \"was the great city of Agadi, called by the Semitics Akkad -- mentioned inGenesis as the capital of Nimrod.\" (Gen. x. 10) . . . \"Akkad lay near the City of Sippara on the Euphrates and North of Babylon.\" (SeeIsis, vol. II. p. 442-3,) Another strange coincidence is found in the fact that the name of the neighbouring above-mentioned City ofSippara is the same as the name of the wife of Moses -- Zipporah (Exodus ii.). Of course the story is a clever addition by Ezra, whocould not be ignorant of it. This curious story is found on fragments of tablets from Kouyunjik, and reads as follows:--1. Sargona, the powerful king, the king of Akkad am I.2. My mother was a princess, my father I did not know; a brother of my father ruled over the country.3. In the city of Azupiran, which is by the side of the River Euphrates.4. My mother, the princess, conceived me; in difficulty she brought me forth.5. She placed me in an ark of rushes, with bitumen my exit she sealed up.6. She launched me in the river, which did not drown me.7. The river carried me, to Akki the water-carrier it brought me.8. Akki, the water-carrier, in tenderness of bowels, lifted me, etc., etc.And now Exodus (ii): \"And when she (Moses' mother) could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed itwith slime and with pitch, and put the child therein, and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 320 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and that he applied the allegory told of Sargon to the Jewish lawgiver. In short, that Exodus was never written by Moses, but re-fabricated from old materials by Ezra.And if so, then why should not other symbols and glyphs far more crude in their phallic element have been added by this adept in thelater Chaldean and Sabaean phallic worship? We are taught that the primeval faith of the Israelites was quite different from thatwhich was developed centuries later by the Talmudists, and before them by David and Hezekiah.All this, notwithstanding the exoteric element, as now found in the two Testaments, is quite sufficient to class the Bible amongesoteric works, and to connect its secret system with Indian, Chaldean, and Egyptian symbolism. The whole cycle of biblical glyphsand numbers as suggested by astronomical observations -- astronomy and theology being closely connected -- is found in Indianexoteric, as well as esoteric, systems. These figures and their symbols, the signs of the Zodiac, the planets, their aspects and nodes --the last term having now passed even into our modern botany to distinguish male and female plants (the unisexual, polygamous,monoecious, dioecious, etc., etc.) -- are known in astronomy as sextiles, quartiles and so on, and have been used for ages and aeonsby the archaic nations, and in one sense have the same meaning as the Hebrew numerals. The earliest forms of elementary geometrymust have certainly been suggested by the observation of the heavenly bodies and their groupings. Hence the most archaic symbolsin Eastern Esotericism are a circle, a point, a triangle, a plane, a cube, a pentacle, and a hexagon, and plane figures with varioussides and angles. This shows the knowledge and use of geometrical symbology to be as old as the world.Starting from this, it becomes easy to understand how nature herself could have taught primeval mankind, even without the help of itsdivine instructors, the first principles of a numerical and geometrical symbol language.* Hence one finds numbers and figures used asan[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] \"The story,\" says Mr. G. Smith, \"is supposed to have happened about 1600 B.C. ratherearlier than the supposed age of Moses.

They are ever the same, with only certain variations growingout of the first figures. Thus the evolution and correlation of the mysteries of Kosmos, of its growth and development -- spiritual andphysical, abstract and concrete -- were first recorded in geometrical changes of shape. Every Cosmogony began with a circle, a point,a triangle, and a cube, up to number 9, when it was synthesized by the first line and a circle -- the Pythagorean mystic Decade, thesum of all, involving and expressing the mysteries of the entire Kosmos; recorded a hundred times more fully in the Hindu system, forhim who can understand its mystic language. The numbers 3 and 4, in their blending of 7, as those of 5, 6, 9, and 10, are the verycorner-stone of Occult Cosmogonies. This decade and its thousand combinations are found in every portion of the globe. Onerecognizes them in the caves and rock-cut temples of Hindostan and Central Asia, as in the pyramids and lithoi of Egypt and America;in the Catacombs of Ozimandyas, in the mounds of the Caucasian snowcapped fastnesses, in the ruins of Palenque, in Easter Island,everywhere whither the foot of ancient man has ever journeyed. The 3 and the 4, the triangle and the cube, or the male and femaleuniversal glyph, showing the first aspect of the evolving deity, is stamped for ever in the Southern Cross in the Heavens, as in theEgyptian Crux-Ansata. As well expressed, \"The Cube unfolded is in display a cross of the tau, or Egyptian form, or of the Christiancross form. . . . A circle attached to the first, gives the ansated cross. . . numbers 3 and 4 counted on the cross, showing a form of the(Hebrew) golden candlestick (in the Holy of Holies), and of the 3 + 4 = 7, and 6 + 1 = 7, days in the circle of the week, as 7 lights of thesun. So also as the week of 7 lights gave origin to the month and year, so it is the time marker of birth. . . . The cross form beingshown, then, by the connected use of the form 113 : 355, the symbol is completed by the attachment of a man to the cross.* This kindof measure was made to co-ordinate with the idea of the origin of human life, and hence the phallic form.**\"The Stanzas show the cross and these numbers playing a prominent part in archaic cosmogony.

In the face of the crushing discoveries of Geology and Anthropologywith regard to the antiquity of man, shall we -- in order to avoid the usual penalty that awaits every one who strays outside the beatenpaths of either Theology or Materialism -- hold to the 6,000 years and \"special creation,\" or accept in submissive admiration ourgenealogy and descent from the ape? Not so, as long as it is known that the secret records hold the said SEVEN keys to the mystery ofthe genesis of man. Faulty, materialistic, and biassed as the scientific theories may be, they are a thousand times nearer the truththan the vagaries of theology. The latter are in their death agony for every one but the most uncompromising bigot and fanatic.*Hence we have no choice but either to blindly accept the deductions of Science, or to cut adrift from it, and withstand it fearlessly toits face, stating what the Secret Doctrine teaches us, being fully prepared to bear the consequences.But let us see whether Science in its materialistic speculations, and even theology in its death-rattle and supreme struggle toreconcile the 6,000 years since Adam with Sir Charles Lyell's \"Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man,\" do not themselves giveus unconsciously a helping hand.

For, enumerating the repeated births of Siva, the latter show him in one Kalpa of a white complexion, in another of a blackcolour, in still another of a red colour, after which the Kumara becomes \"four youths of a yellow colour.\" This strange coincidence, asMr. Proctor would say, speak only in favour of scientific intuition, as Siva-Kumara represents only allegorically the human races duringthe genesis of man. But it led to another intuitional phenomenon -- in the theological ranks this time. The unknown author of\"Primeval Man\" in a desperate effort to screen the divine Revelation from the merciless and eloquent discoveries of geology andanthropology, remarking that \"it would be unfortunate if the defenders of the Bible should be driven into the position of eithersurrendering the inspiration of Scripture, or denying the conclusions of geologists\" -- finds a compromise. Nay, he devotes a thickvolume to proving this fact: \"Adam was not the first man** created upon this earth.\" . . . The exhumed relics of pre-Adamic man,\"instead of shaking our confidence in Scripture, supply additional proof of its veracity\" (p. 194). How so? In the simplest wayimaginable; for the author argues that, henceforth \"we\" (the clergy) \"are enabled to leave scientific men to pursue their studieswithout attempting to coerce them by the fear of heresy\" . . .

Lyell).. . . \"The Bible narrative does not commence with creation, as is commonly supposed, but with the formation of Adam and Eve,millions of years after our planet had been created.

The modern Christian bride -- who does not often blush nowadays before her gay modern lovers -- mighteven derive a moral lesson from this daughter of Satan, in the exuberant fancy of her first human biographer. These pictures -- and toappreciate them at their true value they must be examined in the volume that describes them -- are all suggested with a view toreconcile the infallibility of revealed Scripture with Sir C. Lyell's \"Antiquity of Man\" and other damaging scientific works. But this doesnot prevent truth and fact appearing at the foundation of these vagaries, which the author has never dared to sign with his own, oreven a borrowed name. For, his pre-Adamic races -- not Satanic but simply Atlantic, and the Hermaphrodites before the latter -- arementioned in the Bible when read esoterically, as they are in the Secret Doctrine. The SEVEN KEYS open the mysteries, past andfuture, of the seven great Root Races, as of the seven Kalpas. Though the genesis of man, and even the esoteric geology, will surelybe rejected by Science just as much as the Satanic and pre-Adamic races, yet if having no other way out of their difficulties theScientists have to choose between the two, we feel certain that, Scripture notwithstanding, once the mystery language isapproximately mastered, it is the archaic teaching that will be accepted.-------§ III.PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE AND DIVINE THOUGHT.\"As it would seem irrational to affirm that we already know all existing causes, permission must be given to assume, if need be, anentirely new agent.\"Assuming, what is not strictly accurate as yet, that the undulatory hypothesis accounts for all the facts, we are called on to decidewhether the existence of an undulating Ether is thereby proved.

Still, it is extremely desirable in all such hypotheses to find some collateral confirmation, someevidence aliunde, of THE SUPPOSED ETHER. . . . .

Their only merit is theirsuitability to express the phenomena. They are REPRESENTATIVE FICTIONS.\" -- (\"Logic,\" by Alexander Bain, LL.D., Part II., p. 133)Ether, this hypothetical Proteus, one of the \"representative Fictions\" of modern Science -- which, nevertheless, was so long accepted --is one of the lower \"principles\" of what we call PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE (Akasa, in Sanskrit), one of the dreams of old, and whichhas now become again the dream of modern science. It is the greatest, just as it is the boldest, of the surviving speculations of ancientphilosophers. For the Occultists, however, both ETHER and the Primordial Substance are a reality. To put it plainly, ETHER is theAstral Light, and the Primordial Substance is AKASA, the Upadhi of DIVINE THOUGHT.In modern language, the latter would be better named COSMIC IDEATION -- Spirit; the former, COSMIC SUBSTANCE, Matter.These, the Alpha and the Omega of Being, are but the two facets of the one Absolute Existence. The latter was never addressed, oreven mentioned, by any name in antiquity, except allegorically. In the oldest Aryan race, the Hindu, the worship of the intellectualclasses never consisted (as with the Greeks) in a fervent adoration of marvellous form and art, which led later on to anthropomorphism.But while the Greek philosopher adored form, and the Hindu sage alone \"perceived the true relation of earthly beauty and eternaltruth\" -- the uneducated of every nation understood neither, at any time."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"They do not understand it even now.

The ideals of both are only------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 327 DIVINE THOUGHT, OR CINERITIOUS MATTER.the necessary results of their temperaments, and the outcome of that phase of intellectual progress to which a nation, in itscollectivity, has attained. Hence, as already remarked, the highest flights of modern (Western) metaphysics have fallen far short of thetruth. Much of current Agnostic speculation on the existence of the \"First Cause\" is little better than veiled materialism -- theterminology alone being different. Even so great a thinker as Mr. Herbert Spencer speaks of the \"Unknowable\" occasionally in termsthat demonstrate the lethal influence of materialistic thought, which, like the deadly Sirocco, has withered and blighted all currentontological speculation.*From the early ages of the Fourth Race, when Spirit alone was worshipped and the mystery was made manifest, down to the lastpalmy days of Grecian art at the dawn of Christianity -- the Hellenes alone had dared to raise publicly an altar to the UNKNOWN GOD.Whatever St. Paul may have had in his profound mind when declaring to the Athenians that this \"unknown,\" ignorantly worshipped bythem, was the true God announced by himself -- that Deity was not \"Jehovah\" (see \"The Holy of Holies\"), nor was he \"The Maker ofthe world and all things.\" For it is not the \"God of Israel\" but the \"Unknown\" of the ancient and modern Pantheist that \"dwelleth not intemples made with hands\" (Acts xviii., 23-4).Divine thought cannot be defined, or its meaning explained, except by the numberless manifestations of Cosmic Substance in whichthe former is sensed spiritually by those who can do so. To say this, after having defined it as the Unknown Deity, abstract, impersonal,sexless, which must be placed at the root of every Cosmogony and its subsequent evolution, is equivalent to saying nothing at all. It islike attempting a transcendental equation of conditions for the true values of a set, having in hand for deducing them only a numberof unknown quantities. Its place is found in the old primitive Symbolic charts, in which, as shown in the text, it is represented by aboundless darkness, on the ground of which appears the first central point in white -- thus symbolising coeval and co-eternal SPIRIT-MATTER making its appearance in the phenomenal world, before its first differentiation. When \"the one becomes two,\" it may thenbe[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For instance, when he terms the \"First Cause\" -- the UNKNOWABLE -- a \"power manifesting through phenomena,\" and \"an infiniteeternal Energy\" (?) it is clear that he has grasped solely the physical aspect of the mystery of Being -- the Energies of CosmicSubstance only. The co-eternal aspect of the ONE REALITY -- Cosmic Ideation -- (as to its noumenon, it seems non-existent in themind of the great thinker) is absolutely omitted from consideration. Without doubt, this one-sided mode of dealing with the problem isdue largely to the pernicious Western practice of subordinating consciousness, or regarding it as a \"by-product\" of molecular motion.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 328 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.referred to as Spirit and matter. To \"Spirit\" is referable every manifestation of consciousness, reflective or direct, and of unconsciouspurposiveness (to adopt a modern expression used in Western philosophy, so-called) as evidenced in the Vital Principle, and Nature'ssubmission to the majestic sequence of immutable law. \"Matter\" must be regarded as objectivity in its purest abstraction -- the self-existing basis whose septenary manvantaric differentiations constitute the objective reality underlying the phenomena of each phaseof conscious existence. During the period of Universal Pralaya, Cosmic Ideation is nonexistent; and the variously differentiated statesof Cosmic Substance are resolved back again into the primary state of abstract potential objectivity.Manvantaric impulse commences with the re-awakening of Cosmic Ideation (the \"Universal Mind\") concurrently with, and parallel tothe primary emergence of Cosmic Substance -- the latter being the manvantaric vehicle of the former -- from its undifferentiatedpralayic state. Then, absolute wisdom mirrors itself in its Ideation; which, by a transcendental process, superior to andincomprehensible by human Consciousness, results in Cosmic Energy (Fohat). Thrilling through the bosom of inert Substance, Fohatimpels it to activity, and guides its primary differentiations on all the Seven planes of Cosmic Consciousness. There are thus SevenProtyles (as they are now called), while Aryan antiquity called them the Seven Prakriti, or Natures, serving, severally, as the relativelyhomogeneous basis, which in the course of the increasing heterogeneity (in the evolution of the Universe) differentiate into themarvellous complexity presented by phenomena on the planes of perception. The term \"relatively\" is used designedly, because thevery existence of such a process, resulting in the primary segregations of undifferentiated Cosmic Substance into its septenary bases ofevolution, compels us to regard the protyle* of each plane as only a mediate phase assumed by Substance in its passage fromabstract, into full objectivity.Cosmic Ideation is said to be non-existent during Pralayic periods, for the simple reason that there is no one, and nothing, to perceiveits effects. There can be no manifestation of Consciousness, semi-consciousness, or even \"unconscious purposiveness,\" except throughthe"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The term Protyle is due to Mr. Crookes, the eminent chemist, who has given that name to pre-Matter, if one may so call primordialand purely homogeneous substances, suspected, if not actually yet found, by Science in the ultimate composition of the atom. Butthe incipient segregation of primordial matter into atoms and molecules takes its rise subsequent to the evolution of the SevenProtyles. It is the last of these -- having recently detected the possibility of its existence on our plane -- that Mr. Crookes is in search of.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 329 THE UNIVERSAL ILLUSION.vehicle of matter; that is to say, on this our plane, wherein human consciousness in its normal state cannot soar beyond what is knownas transcendental metaphysics, it is only through some molecular aggregation or fabric that Spirit wells up in a stream of individual orsub-conscious subjectivity. And as Matter existing apart from perception is a mere abstraction, both of these aspects of the ABSOLUTE-- Cosmic Substance and Cosmic Ideation -- are mutually inter-dependent. In strict accuracy -- to avoid confusion and misconception --the term \"Matter\" ought to be applied to the aggregate of objects of possible perception, and \"Substance\" to noumena; for inasmuchas the phenomena of our plane are the creation of the perceiving Ego -- the modifications of its own subjectivity -- all the \"states ofmatter representing the aggregate of perceived objects\" can have but a relative and purely phenomenal existence for the children ofour plane. As the modern Idealists would say, the co-operation of Subject and Object results in the Sense-object or phenomenon. Butthis does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that it is the same on all other planes; that the co-operation of the two on the planesof their septenary differentiation results in a septenary aggregate of phenomena which are likewise non-existent per se, thoughconcrete realities for the Entities of whose experience they form a part, in the same manner as the rocks and rivers around us are realfrom the stand-point of a physicist, though unreal illusions of sense from that of the metaphysician. It would be an error to say, or evenconceive such a thing. From the stand-point of the highest metaphysics, the whole Universe, gods included, is an illusion; but theillusion of him who is in himself an illusion differs on every plane of consciousness; and we have no more right to dogmatise aboutthe possible nature of the perceptive faculties of an Ego on, say, the sixth plane, than we have to identify our perceptions with, ormake them a standard for, those of an ant, in its mode of consciousness. The pure object apart from consciousness* is unknown to us,while living on the plane of our three-dimensional World; as we know only the mental states it excites in the perceiving Ego. And, solong as the contrast of Subject and Object endures -- to wit, as long as we enjoy our five senses and no more, and do not know how todivorce our all-perceiving Ego (the Higher Self) from the thraldom of these senses -- so long will it be impossible for the personal Egoto break through the barrier which separates it from a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Cosmic Ideation focussed in a principle or upadhi (basis) results as the consciousness of the individual Ego. Its manifestation varieswith the degree of upadhi, e.g., through that known as Manas it wells up as Mind-Consciousness; through the more finelydifferentiated fabric (sixth state of matter) of the Buddhi resting on the experience of Manas as its basis -- as a stream of spiritualINTUITION.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 330 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.knowledge of things in themselves (or Substance). That Ego, progressing in an arc of ascending subjectivity, must exhaust theexperience of every plane. But not till the Unit is merged in the ALL, whether on this or any other plane, and Subject and Object alikevanish in the absolute negation of the Nirvanic State (negation, again, only from our plane), is scaled that peak of Omniscience -- theKnowledge of things-in-themselves; and the solution of the yet more awful riddle approached, before which even the highest DhyanChohan must bow in silence and ignorance -- the unspeakable mystery of that which is called by the Vedantins, the PARABRAHMAM.Therefore, such being the case, all those who sought to give a name to the incognizable Principle have simply degraded it. Even tospeak of Cosmic Ideation -- save in its phenomenal aspect -- is like trying to bottle up primordial Chaos, or to put a printed label onETERNITY.What, then, is the \"primordial Substance,\" that mysterious object of which Alchemy was ever talking, and which became the subject ofphilosophical speculation in every age? What can it be finally, even in its phenomenal pre-differentiation? Even that is ALL inmanifested Nature and -- nothing to our senses. It is mentioned under various names in every Cosmogony, referred to in everyphilosophy, and shown to be, to this day, the ever grasp-eluding PROTEUS in Nature. We touch and do not feel it; we look at itwithout seeing it; we breathe it and do not perceive it; we hear and smell it without the smallest cognition that it is there; for it is inevery molecule of that which in our illusion and ignorance we regard as Matter in any of its states, or conceive as a feeling, a thought,an emotion. . . . In short, it is the \"upadhi,\" or vehicle, of every possible phenomenon, whether physical, mental, or psychic. In theopening sentences of Genesis, as in the Chaldean Cosmogony; in the Puranas of India, and in the Book of the Dead of Egypt, itopens everywhere the cycle of manifestation. It is termed \"Chaos,\" and the face of the waters, incubated by the Spirit proceeding fromthe Unknown, under whatever name.

Theseptenary gradation, and the innumerable subdivisions and differences, made by the ancients between the powers of Ethercollectively, from its outward fringe of effects, with which our Science is so familiar, up to the \"Imponderable Substance,\" onceadmitted as the \"Ether of Space,\" now about to be rejected, has been ever a vexing riddle for every branch of knowledge. Themythologists and symbologists of our day, confused by this incomprehensible glorification, on the one hand, and degradation on theother, of the same deified entity and in the same religious systems, are often driven to the most ludicrous mistakes. The Church, firmas a rock in each and all of her early errors of interpretation, has made of Ether the abode of her Satanic legions.* The wholehierarchy of the \"Fallen\" angels is there; the Cosmocratores -- or the \"world bearers,\" (according to Bossuet); Mundi Tenentes -- the\"world holders,\" as Tertullian calls them; and Mundi Domini \"world dominations,\" or rather dominators, the Curbati, or \"Curved,\" etc.,who thus make of the stars and celestial orbs in their course -- Devils!The difference made between the seven states of Ether (itself one of the Seven Cosmic principles), while the AEther of the Ancients isuniversal Fire, may be seen in the injunctions by Zoroaster and Psellus, respectively. The former said: \"Consult it only when it iswithout form or figure,\" absque forma et figura, which means without flames or burning coals. \"When it has a form -- heed it not,\"teaches Psellus; \"but when it is formless, obey it, for it is then sacred fire, and all it will reveal thee, shall be true.\"** This proves thatEther, itself an aspect of Akasa, has in its turn several aspects or \"principles.\"All the ancient nations deified AEther in its imponderable aspect and potency. Virgil calls Jupiter, Pater omnipotens AEther, \"thegreat AEther.\"*** The Hindus have also placed it among their deities; under the name of Akasa (the synthesis of AEther).

With the philosophical Hindus the elements are Tamas, i.e., \"unenlightened by intellect, which they obscure.\"We have now to exhaust the question of the mystical meaning of \"Primordial Chaos\" and of the Root-Principle, and show how theywere connected in the ancient philosophies with Akasa, wrongly translated AEther, and also with Maya (illusion) -- of which Ishwara isthe male aspect. We shall speak further on of the intelligent \"principle,\" or rather of the invisible immaterial properties, in the visibleand material elements, that \"sprung from the primordial Chaos.\"For, \"What is the primordial Chaos but AEther?\" it is asked in \"ISIS UNVEILED.\" Not the modern Ether; not such as is recognised now,but such as was known to the ancient philosophers long before the time of Moses; but AEther, with all its mysterious and occultproperties, containing in itself the germs of universal creation. Upper AEther or Akasa, is the celestial virgin and mother of everyexisting form and being, from whose bosom, as soon as \"incubated\" by the Divine Spirit, are called into existence Matter and Life,Force and Action. AEther is the Aditi of the Hindus, and it is Akasa. Electricity, magnetism, heat, light, and chemical action are solittle understood even now that fresh facts are constantly widening the range of our knowledge.

In that he cast seed. . . . . That became a golden Egg.\" (V.6, 7, 8, 9.) Whence this Self-existent Lord? It is called THIS, and is spoken of as \"Darkness, imperceptible, without definite qualities,undiscoverable as if wholly in sleep.\" (V. 5.) Having dwelt in that Egg for a whole divine year, he \"who is called in the world Brahma,\"splits that Egg in two, and from the upper portion he forms the heaven, from the lower the earth, and from the middle the sky and \"theperpetual place of waters.\" (12, 13.)But there is, directly following these verses, something more important for us, as it corroborates entirely our esoteric teachings. Fromverse 14 to 36, evolution is given in the order described in the Esoteric philosophy. This cannot be easily gainsaid. Even Medhatithi,the son of Viraswamin, and the author of the Commentary, \"the Manubhasya,\" whose date, according to the western Orientalists, is1,000 A.D., helps us with his remarks to the elucidation of the truth. He showed himself either unwilling to give out more, because heknew that truth which has to be kept from the profane, or else he was really puzzled. Still, what he does give out makes the septenaryprinciple in men and nature plain enough.Let us begin with Chapter 1. of the \"Ordinances\" or \"Laws\" after the Self-existent Lord, the unmanifesting Logos of the Unknown\"Darkness,\" becomes manifested in the golden Egg. It is from this \"Egg,\" from ----(11.) That which is the undiscrete (undifferentiated) cause, eternal, which Is and Is not, from It issued that male who is called in theworld Brahma. . . . .Here we find, as in all genuine philosophical systems, even the \"Egg\" or the Circle (or Zero), boundless Infinity, referred to as IT,* andBrahma, the first unit only, referred to as the male god, i.e., the fructifying Principle. It is [[diagram]] or 10 (ten) the Decade. On theplane of the Septenary or our World only, it is called Brahma. On that of the Unified Decade in the realm of Reality, this maleBrahma is an illusion.(14.) \"From Self (atmanah) he created mind, (1) which is and is not;[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The ideal apex of the Pythagorean triangle: vide Sections in Vol. II., \"Cross and Circle,\" and the \"Earliest Symbolics of the Cross.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 334 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(2) and from mind, Ego-ism (Self-Consciousness) the ruler; (3) the Lord.\"(1.) The mind is Manas. Medhatithi, the commentator, justly observes here that it is the reverse of this and shows already interpolationand rearranging; for it is Manas that springs from Ahamkara or (Universal) Self-Consciousness, as Manas in the microcosm springs fromMahat, or Maha-Buddhi (Buddhi, in man). For Manas is dual, and as shown and translated by Colebrooke, \"is serving both for senseand action, is an organ by affinity, being cognate with the rest.\" \"The rest\" means, here, that Manas, our fifth principle (the fifth,because the body was named the first, which is the reverse of the true philosophical order)* is in affinity both with Atma-Buddhi andwith the lower four principles. Hence, our teaching: namely, that Manas follows Atma-Buddhi to Devachan, and that the lower (dregs,the residue of) Manas remains with Kama rupa, in Limbus, or Kama-loka, the abode of the \"Shells.\"(2.) Such is the meaning of Manas, which \"is, and is not.\"(3.) Medhatithi translates it as \"the one conscious of the I,\" or Ego, not \"ruler,\" as the Orientalists do. Thus they translate verse 16: \"Healso, having made the subtile parts of those six (the Great Self and the five organs of sense) of unmeasured brightness, to enter intothe elements of Self (Atmamatrasu) created all beings.\"When, according to Medhatithi, it ought to read matra-Chit instead of \"Atmamatrasu,\" and thus be made to say:--\"He having pervaded the subtile parts of those six, of unmeasured brightness, by elements of self, created all beings.\""},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"This latter reading must be the correct one, since he, the Self, is what we call Atma, and thus constitutes the seventh principle, thesynthesis of the \"six.\" Such is also the opinion of the editor of Manava-dharma Shastra, who seems to have intuitionally entered fardeeper into the spirit of the philosophy than has the translator of the \"Ordinances of Manu,\" the late Dr. Burnell. For he hesitates littlebetween the text of Kulluka and the Commentaries of Medhatithi. Rejecting the tanmatra, or subtile elements, and the atmamatrasuof Kulluka, he says, applying the principles to the Cosmic Self: \"The six appear rather to be the manas plus the five principles ofEther, air, fire, water, earth\"; \"having united five portions of these six with the spiritual element (the seventh) he (thus) created allexisting things;\" atmamatra is therefore the spiritual atom as opposed to the elementary, not reflective \"elements of himself.\" Thus hecorrects the translation of verse -- \"17. As the subtile elements of bodily forms of This One depend on these six, so[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide A. Coke Burnell's translation, edited by Ed. W.

This non-eternal (Universe) arises then from the Eternal, by means of the subtile elements of forms of those seven very gloriousprinciples\" (purusha).Commenting upon which, according to Medhatithi, the Editor remarks that \"the five elements plus mind (Manas) and Self-Consciousness (Ahamkara)* are meant;\" \"subtile elements,\" as before (meaning) \"five portions of form\" (or principles). For verse 20shows it, when saying of these (five elements, or \"five portions of form\" (rupa, plus Manas and Self-Consciousness) that they constitutethe \"seven purusha,\" or principles, called in the Puranas the \"Seven Prakritis.\"Moreover, these \"five elements\" or \"five portions\" are spoken of in verse 27 as \"those which are called the atomic destructible portions\"-- therefore \"distinct from the atoms of the nyaya.\"This creative Brahma, issuing from the mundane or golden egg, unites in himself both the male and the female principles. He is, inshort, the same as all the creative Protologoi. Of Brahma, however, it could not be said, as of Dionysos: \"[[protogonon diphue trigononBaccheion Hanakta Hagrion arreton kruphion dikerota dimorphon]]\" -- a lunar Jehovah -- Bacchus truly, with David dancing nudebefore his symbol in the ark -- because no licentious Dionysia were ever established in his name and honour. All such public worshipwas exoteric, and the great universal symbols were distorted universally, as those of Krishna are now by the Vallabacharyas ofBombay, the followers of the infant god. But are these popular gods the true Deity? Are they the Apex and synthesis of the sevenfoldcreation, man included? Never! Each and all are one of the rungs of that septenary ladder of Divine Consciousness, pagan asChristian. For Ain-Soph also is said to manifest through the Seven Letters of Jehovah's name who, having usurped the place of theUnknown Limitless, was given by his devotees his Seven Angels of the Presence -- his Seven Principles. Yet they are mentioned inalmost every school. In the pure Sankhya philosophy mahat, ahamkara and the five tanmatras are called the seven Prakritis (orNatures), and they are counted from Maha-Buddhi or Mahat down to Earth. (See Sankhya Karika III. and Commentaries.)Nevertheless, however disfigured for Rabbinical purposes is the original Elohistic version by Ezra, however repulsive at times even the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Ahamkara, as universal Self-Consciousness, has a triple aspect, as also Manas.

There is more wisdom concealed under the exoteric fables of Puranas and Bible than inall the exoteric facts and science in the literature of the world, and more OCCULT true Science, than there is of exact knowledge inall the academies. Or, in plainer and stronger language, there is as much esoteric wisdom in some portions of the exoteric Puranasand Pentateuch, as there is of nonsense and of designed childish fancy in it, when read only in the dead-letter murderousinterpretations of great dogmatic religions, and especially of sects.Let anyone read the first verses of chapter i. of Genesis and reflect upon them.

It does not mean\"infinite duration,\" and the word for ever in the Old Testament, only signifies a \"long time.\" Nor is the term \"eternity\" used in theChristian sense in the Puranas. For in Vishnu Purana, it is clearly stated that by Eternity and Immortality only \"existence to the end ofthe Kalpa\" is meant (Book II. chap. viii.).*** Orphic theogony is purely Oriental and Indian in its Spirit. The successive transformations it has undergone, have now separated itwidely from the spirit of ancient Cosmogony, as may be seen by comparing it even with Hesiod's theogony. Yet the truly Aryan Hinduspirit breaks forth everywhere in both Hesiod's and the Orphic theogony. (See the remarkable work of James Darmesteter,Cosmogonies Aryennes, in his Essais Orientaux.) Thus the original Greek conception of Chaos is that of the Secret Wisdom Religion.In Hesiod, therefore, Chaos is infinite, boundless, endless and beginningless in duration, an abstraction at the same time as a visiblepresence. SPACE filled with darkness, which is primordial matter in its precosmic state.

For to whom are those words of command addressed? And who is it whocommands? That which commands is the eternal Law, and he who obeys, the Elohim, the known quantity acting in and with x, or thecoefficient of the unknown quantity, the Forces of the ONE Force. All this is Occultism, and is found in the archaic STANZAS. It isperfectly immaterial whether we call these \"Forces\" the Dhyan Chohans, or the Ophanim, as St. John does.\"The one Universal Light, which to Man is Darkness, is ever existent,\" says the Chaldean \"Book of Numbers.\" From it proceedsperiodically the ENERGY, which is reflected in the \"Deep\" or Chaos, the store-house of future worlds, and, once awakened, stirs upand fructifies the latent Forces, which are the ever present eternal potentialities in it.

As truly expressed by an opponent, Magus and magnes are two branches growing from the same trunk andshooting forth the same resultants.

Science and amiable speech,\" i.e., develops anextraordinary eloquence in the sybil, the sensitive, and even some orators.This \"fire\" is spoken of in all the Hindu Books, as also in the Kabalistic works. The Zohar explains it as the \"white hidden fire, in theResha trivrah\" (the White Head), whose Will causes the fiery fluid to flow in 370 currents in every direction of the universe. It isidentical with the \"Serpent that runs with 370 leaps\" of the Siphrah Dzenioota, which, when the \"Perfect Man,\" the Metatron, is raised,i.e., when the divine man indwells in the animal man, it, the Serpent, becomes three spirits, that is to say, is Atma-Buddhi-Manas, inour theosophical phraseology. (Vide Part II. in Vol. II., §§ 3, \"The Many Meanings of the War in Heaven.\")Spirit, then, or Cosmic Ideation, and Cosmic Substance -- one of whose principles is Ether -- are one, and include the ELEMENTS, inthe sense St. Paul attaches to them. These Elements are the veiled Synthesis standing for Dhyan Chohans, Devas, Sephiroth,Amshaspends, Archangels, etc., etc. The Ether of science -- the Ilus of Berosus, or the Protyle of Chemistry -- constitutes, so to speak,the rude material (relatively) out of which the above-named \"Builders,\" following the plan traced out for them eternally in the DIVINETHOUGHT, fashion the systems in the Cosmos. They are \"myths,\" we are told. \"No more so than Ether and the Atoms,\" we answer.The two latter are absolute necessities of physical science; the \"Builders\" are as absolute a necessity of metaphysics. We are twittedwith: \"You never saw them.\" We ask the materialists: \"Have you ever seen Ether, or your Atoms, or, again, your FORCE?\" Moreover,one of the greatest Western Evolutionists of our modern day, the coadjutor of Darwin, Mr. A. R. Wallace, when discussing theinadequacy of Natural Selection alone to account for the physical form of Man, admits the guiding action of \"higher intelligences\" asa \"necessary part of the great laws which govern the material Universe\" (\"Contributions to Theory of Natural Selection\").These \"higher intelligences\" are the Dhyan Chohans of the Occultists.Indeed, there are few Myths in any religious system worthy of the name, but have an historical as well as a scientific foundation.\"Myths,\" justly observes Pococke, \"are now proved to be fables, just in proportion as we misunderstand them; truths, in proportion asthey were once understood.\"The one prevailing, most distinct idea -- found in all ancient teaching,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 340 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"with reference to Cosmic Evolution and the first \"creation\" of our Globe with all its products, organic and inorganic (strange word foran Occultist to use) -- is that the whole Kosmos has sprung from the DIVINE THOUGHT.

The former of these is, so to say, the aspect of the central point turned inward into regions quiteinaccessible to human intellect, and is absolute abstraction; whereas, in its aspect as Mulaprakriti -- the eternal root of all, -- it givesone some hazy comprehension at least of the Mystery of Being.\"Therefore, it was taught in the inner temples that this visible universe of spirit and matter is but the concrete image of the idealabstraction; it was built on the model of the first DIVINE IDEA. Thus our universe existed from Eternity in a latent state. The soulanimating this purely spiritual universe is the central sun, the highest deity itself. It was not the One who built the concrete form of theidea, but the first-begotten; and as it was constructed on the geometrical figure of the dodecahedron,* the first-begotten 'was pleasedto employ twelve thousand years in its creation.' The latter number is expressed in the Tyrrhenian cosmogony,** which shows mancreated in the sixth millennium. This agrees with the Egyptian theory of 6,000 'years'*** and with the Hebrew computation. But it isthe exoteric form of it. The secret computation explains that the 'twelve thousand and the 6,000 years' are YEARS OF BRAHMA -- oneday of Brahma being equal to 4,320,000,000 years.

Nevertheless, occult Science -- having survivedeven the great Flood that submersed the antediluvian giants and with them their very memory, save in the Secret Doctrine, the Bibleand other Scriptures -- still holds the Key to all the world problems.Let us apply that Key to the rare fragments of long-forgotten cosmogonies and try by their scattered parts to re-establish the onceUniversal Cosmogony of the Secret Doctrine. The Key fits them all. No one can study ancient philosophies seriously withoutperceiving that the striking similitude of conception between all -- in their exoteric form very often, in their hidden spirit invariably -- isthe result of no mere coincidence, but of a concurrent design: and that there was, during the youth of mankind, one languages, oneknowledge, one universal religion, when there were no churches, no creeds or sects, but when every man was a priest unto himself.And, if it is shown that already in those ages which are shut out from our sight by the exuberant growth of tradition, human religiousthought developed in uniform sympathy in every portion of the globe; then, it becomes evident that, born under whatever latitude, inthe cold North or the burning South, in the East or West, that thought was inspired by the same revelations, and man was nurturedunder the protecting shadow of the same TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"* Bordj is called a fire-mountain -- a volcano; therefore it contains fire, rock, earth and water: the male, or active and the female, orpassive, elements.

It is abody of limitless extent, whose PRINCIPLES, in Occult phraseology -- each being in its turn a septenary -- manifest in ourphenomenal world only the grossest fabric of their sub-divisions. \"No one has ever seen the Elements in their fulness,\" the Doctrineteaches. We have to search for our Wisdom in the original expressions of the primeval people and in their synonyms. Even the latestof them -- the Jews -- show in their Kabalistic teachings this idea, e.g., the seven-headed Serpent of Space, called \"the great Sea.\" \"Inthe beginning, the Alhim created the heavens and the earth; the 6 (Sephiroth). . . . They created six, and on these all things arebased. And those (six) depend upon the seven forms of the cranium up to Dignity of all Dignities (Siphrah Dzenioota, i, § 16), see partii., vol. ii. \"Ancient Divisions and the Mystic Numbers.\"Now Wind, Air and Spirit have ever been synonymous with every nation. Pneuma (Spirit) and Anemos (the wind) with the Greeks,Spiritus and Ventus with the Latins, were convertible terms even if dissociated from the original idea of the breath of life. In the\"Forces\" of Science we see but the material effect of the spiritual affect of one or the other of the four primordial Elements,transmitted to us by the 4th Race, as we shall transmit Ether (or rather the gross subdivision of it) in its fulness to the Sixth Root Race.This is explained in the text of this and the following Book.\"Chaos\" is called senseless by the ancients, because it represented and contained in itself (Chaos and Space being synonymous) allthe Elements in their rudimentary, undifferentiated State.

Their AEtherwas the Akasa of the Hindus; the Ether accepted in physics is but one of its subdivisions, on our plane, -- the Astral Light of theKabalists with all its evil as well as good effects.On account of the Essence of AEther, or the Unseen Space, being held divine as the supposed veil of Deity, it was regarded as themedium between this life and the next one. The ancients considered that when the directing active \"Intelligences\" (the gods) retiredfrom any portion of Ether in our Space -- the four realms which they superintend -- then that particular place was left in the possessionof evil, so called by reason of the absence of the Good from it.\"The existence of spirit in the common mediator, the ether, is denied by materialism; while theology makes of it a personal god. Butthe Kabalist holds that both are wrong, saying that in ether, the elements represent but matter -- the blind cosmic forces of nature;while Spirit represents the intelligence which directs them. The Aryan, Hermetic, Orphic, and Pythagorean cosmogonical doctrines, aswell as those of Sanchoniathon and Berosus, are all based upon one irrefutable formula, viz., that the aether and chaos, or, in thePlatonic language, mind and matter, were the two primeval and eternal principles of the universe, utterly independent of anythingelse. The former was the all-vivifying intellectual principle; the chaos, a shapeless liquid principle, without 'form or sense,' from theunion of which two sprung into existence the universe, or rather the universal world, the first androgynous deity -- the chaotic matterbecoming its body, and ether its soul. According to the phraseology of a Fragment of Hermias, 'chaos, from this union with spirit,obtaining sense, shone with pleasure, and thus was produced the Protogonos (the first-born) light.'* This is the universal trinity, basedon the metaphysical conceptions of the ancients, who, reasoning by analogy, made of man, who is a compound of intellect andmatter, the microcosm of the macrocosm, or great universe.\" (Isis Unveiled.)\"Nature abhors Vacuum\" said the Peripatetics, who comprehended perhaps, though materialists in their way, why Democritus, with hisinstructor Leucippus, taught that the first principles of all things contained in the Universe were atoms and a vacuum. The lattermeans simply latent Deity or force; which, before its first manifestation when it became WILL -- communicating the first impulse tothese atoms -- was the great Nothingness, Ain-Soph, or NO-THING; was, therefore, to every sense, a Void -- or CHAOS."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"That Chaos, however, became the \"Soul of the World,\" according to Plato and the Pythagoreans.

This was the belief of the Chaldees. \"These Chaldeans,\" writes Philo, the Jew, speakingvery flippantly of the first instructors of his ancestors, \"were of opinion that the Kosmos, among the things that exist (?) is a single point,either being itself God (Theos) or that in it is God, comprehending the soul of all things.\" (See his \"Migration of Abraham,\" 32.)Chaos-Theos-Kosmos are but the three aspects of their synthesis -- SPACE. One can never hope to solve the mystery of this Tetraktisby holding to the dead-letter even of the old philosophies, as now extant. But, even in these CHAOS-THEOS-KOSMOS = SPACE, areidentified in all Eternity, as the One Unknown Space, the last word about which will, perhaps, never be known before our seventhRound. Nevertheless, the allegories and metaphysical symbols about the primeval and perfect CUBE, are remarkable even in theexoteric Puranas.There, also, Brahma is the Theos, evolving out of Chaos, or the great \"Deep,\" the waters, over which Spirit = SPACE, personified byayana -- the Spirit moving over the face of the future boundless Kosmos -- is silently hovering, in the first hour of re-awakening. It isalso Vishnu, sleeping on Ananta-Sesha, the great Serpent of Eternity, of which Western theology, ignorant of the Kabala, the only keythat opens the secrets of the Bible, has made -- the Devil. It is the first triangle or the Pythagorean triad, the \"God of the threeAspects,\" before it is transformed through its perfect quadrature of the infinite Circle into the \"four-faced Brahma.\"\"Of him who is and yet is not, from the not-being, Eternal Cause, is born the Being-Purusha,\" says Manu, the legislator.In Isis Unveiled, it is said that:--\"In the Egyptian mythology, Kneph, the Eternal Unrevealed God, is represented by a snake emblem of Eternity encircling a water urn,with its head hovering over the waters, which it incubates with its breath. In this case the serpent is the Agathodaemon, the good spirit:in its opposite aspect, it is the Kakodaemon -- the bad one. In the Scandinavian Eddas, the honey dew, the fruit of the gods and ofthe creative busy Yggdrasill (bees), falls during the hours of night, when the atmosphere is impregnated with humidity; and in theNorthern mythologies, as the passive principle of creation, it typifies the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 345 THE BIRTH OF MIND.creation of the universe out of water; this dew is the astral light in one of its combinations, and possesses creative as well asdestructive properties. In the Chaldean legend of Berosus, Oannes or Dagon, the man-fish, instructing the people, shows the infantworld created out of water, and all beings originating from this prima materia. Moses teaches that only earth and water can bring aliving soul: and we read in the Scriptures that herbs could not grow until the Eternal caused it to rain upon earth. In the MexicanPopol-Vuh, man is created out of mud or clay (terre glaise), taken from under the water. Brahma creates the great Muni (or first man)seated on his lotus, only after having called into being spirits who thus enjoyed over mortals a priority of existence, and he createshim out of water, air and earth. Alchemists claim that the primordial or pre-Adamic earth, when reduced to its first substance, is in itssecond stage of transformation like clear water, the first being the alkahest proper. This primordial substance is said to contain withinitself the essence of all that goes to make up man; it has not only all the elements of his physical being, but even the \"breath of life\"itself in a latent state, ready to be awakened. This it derives from the \"incubation\" of the \"Spirit of God\" upon the face of the waters --CHAOS: in fact, this substance is chaos itself. From this it was that Paracelsus claimed to be able to make his \"homunculi;\" and this iswhy Thales, the great natural philosopher, maintained that water was the principle of all things in nature.* . . . Job says, in chap. xxvi.5, that \"dead things are formed from under the waters, and inhabitants thereof.\" In the original text, instead of \"dead things,\" it iswritten dead Rephaim (giants or mighty primitive men), from whom \"Evolution\" may one day trace our present race.\"\"In the primordial state of the creation,\" says Polier's Mythologie des Indous, \"the rudimental universe, submerged in water, reposed inthe bosom of Vishnu. Sprung from this chaos and darkness, Brahma, the architect of the world, poised on a lotus-leaf, floated (moved)upon the waters, unable to discern anything but water and darkness.\" Perceiving such a dismal state of things, Brahma soliloquises inconsternation: \"Who am I? Whence came I?\" Then he hears a voice:** \"Direct your thoughts to Bhagavat.\" Brahma, rising from hisnatatory position, seats himself upon the lotus in an attitude of contemplation, and reflects upon the Eternal, who, pleased with thisevidence of piety, disperses the primeval darkness and opens his understanding. \"After this Brahma issues from the universal egg(infinite chaos) as light, for his understanding is now opened, and he sets himself to work: he moves on the eternal waters, with thespirit of God within himself; and in his capacity of mover of the waters he is Vishnu, or Narayana.\" This is"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* With the Greeks, the \"River-gods,\" all of them the Sons of the primeval ocean (Chaos in its masculine aspect), were the respectiveancestors of the Hellenic races.

Similarly in the Jewish Scriptures, the history of the creationopens with the spirit of God and his creative emanation -- another Deity.**The Zohar teaches that it is the primordial elements -- the trinity of Fire, Air and Water -- the four cardinal points, and all the Forces ofNature, which form collectively the VOICE of the WILL Memrab, or the \"Word,\" the Logos of the Absolute Silent ALL. \"The indivisiblepoint, limitless and unknowable\" spreads itself over the endless space, and thus forms a veil (the Mulaprakriti of Parabraham) whichconceals this Absolute point.

In the Bible it is first Alhim, then Jahva-Alhim, and finally Jehovah --after theseparation of the sexes in chapter iv. of Genesis. It is noticeable that nowhere, except in the later, the last Cosmogonies of our Fifthrace, is the ineffable and unutterable NAME*** -- the symbol of the Unknown Deity, which was used only in the MYSTERIES -- used inconnection with the \"Creation\" of the Universe. It is the \"Movers,\" the \"Runners,\" the theoi (from [[theein]], \"to run\"), who do the work offormation, the \"Messengers\" of the manvantaric law, who have now become in Christianity the \"messengers\" (malachim); and it seemsthe same in Hinduism or early Brahmanism. For it is not Brahma who creates in the Rig Veda, but the Prajapati, the \"Lords of Being,\"who are the Rishis; the word Rishi (according to Professor Mahadeo Kunte) being connected with the word to move, to lead on,applied to them in their terrestrial character, when, as Patriarchs, they lead their hosts on the Seven Rivers.Moreover, the very word \"God\" in the singular, embracing all the gods -- or theos from theoi -- came to the \"superior\" civilized nationsfrom a strange source, one entirely and as pre-eminently phallic as the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Orthography of the \"Archaic Dictionary.\"** We do not mean the current or accepted Bible, but the real Jewish one, now explained kabalistically.*** It is \"unutterable\" for the simple reason that it is non-existent.

The attempt to derive God from the Anglo-Saxon synonym \"good\" is an abandoned idea, forin no other language, in all of which the term varies more or less, from the Persian Khoda down to the Latin Deus, has an instancebeen found of a name of God being derived from the attribute of Goodness. To the Latin races it comes from the Aryan Dyaus (theDay); to the Slavonian, from the Greek Bacchus (Bagh-bog); and to the Saxon races directly from the Hebrew Yodh or Jod. The latteris [[diagram]], the number-letter 10, male and female, and Jod the phallic hook:-- hence the Saxon Godh, the Germanic Gott, andthe English God. This symbolic term may be said to represent the Creator of physical \"Humanity,\" on the terrestrial plane; but surely ithad nothing to do with the formation or \"Creation\" of Spirit, gods, or Kosmos!Chaos-Theos-Kosmos, the triple deity, is all in all. Therefore, it is said to be male and female, good and evil, positive and negative:the whole series of contrasted qualities. When latent (in pralaya) it is incognizable and becomes the unknowable Deity. It can beknown only in its active functions; hence as matter-Force and living Spirit, the correlations and outcome, or the expression, on thevisible plane, of the ultimate and ever-to-be unknown UNITY.In its turn this triple unit is the producer of the four primary \"Elements,\"* which are known in our visible terrestrial nature as the seven(so far the five) Elements, each divisible into forty-nine (or seven times seven) sub-elements, with about seventy of which Chemistry isacquainted. Every Cosmical Element such as Fire, Air, Water, Earth, partaking of the qualities and defects of their Primaries, are intheir nature Good and Evil, Force (or Spirit) and Matter, etc., etc.; and each, therefore, is at one and the same time Life and Death,Health and Disease, Action and Reaction.

In the primordial Chaos, before it became developed into theSeven Oceans (Sapta Samudra) -- emblematical of the seven gunas (conditioned qualities) composed of trigunas (Satwa, Rajas andTamas, see Puranas) -- lie latent both Amrita (immortality) and Visha (poison, death, evil). This allegory is found in the \"Churning ofthe Ocean\" by the gods. Amrita is beyond any guna, for it is UNCONDITIONED per se; yet when fallen into the phenomenal creationit got mixed up with EVIL, Chaos, with latent theos in it, and before Kosmos was evolved. Hence, one finds Vishnu -- standing here foreternal Law -- periodically calling forth Kosmos into activity -- \"churning out of the primitive Ocean (boundless Chaos) the Amrita ofEternity, reserved only for the gods and devas; and he has to employ in the task Nagas and Asuras -- demons in exoteric Hinduism.The whole allegory is highly philosophical, and we find it repeated in every philosophical System. Plato, having fully embraced theideas of Pythagoras -- who had brought them from India -- compiled and published them in a form more intelligible than themysterious numerals of the Greek Sage. Thus the Kosmos is \"the Son\" with Plato, having for his father and mother the Divine Thoughtand Matter.*\"The Egyptians,\" says Dunlap,** \"distinguish between an older and younger Horus; the former the brother of Osiris, the latter the son ofOsiris and Isis.\" The first is the Idea of the world remaining in the Demiurgic Mind, \"born in darkness before the creation of the world.\"The second Horus is this \"Idea\" going forth from the Logos, becoming clothed with matter, and assuming an actual existence.***\"The Mundane God, eternal, boundless, young and old, of winding form,\"**** say the Chaldean oracles.This \"winding form\" is a figure to express the vibratory motion of the Astral Light, with which the ancient priests were perfectly wellacquainted, though its name was invented by the Martinists.Now Cosmolatry has the finger of scorn pointed at its superstitions by modern Science, which ought, however, as advised by a French[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Plutarch, \"Isis and Osiris,\" I., vi.** \"Spirit History of Man,\" p. 88.*** Mover's \"Phoinizer,\" 268.**** Cory, \"Fragments,\" 240.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 349 THE MANY ARE ONE.savant, before laughing at it \"to remodel entirely its own system of cosmo-pneumatological education.\" Satis eloquentiae, sapientiaeparvum.

The latter are nowaccepted by those who reject Romulus as a myth, and are represented as living and historical Entities. Verbum satis sapienti.In the Zohar, En-Soph is also the ONE, and the infinite Unity. This was known to the very few learned Fathers of the Church, who wereaware that Jehovah was but a third rate potency and no \"highest\" God. But while complaining bitterly of the Gnostics and saying . . .\"our Heretics hold . . . that PROPATOR is known but to the Only begotten Son* (who is Brahma among the rest) that is to the mind\"(nous), Irenaeus never mentioned that the Jews did the same in their real secret books. Valentinus, \"the profoundest doctor of theGnosis,\" held that \"there was a perfect AION who existed before Bythos, or Buthon (the first father of unfathomable nature, which isthe second Logos) called Propator.\" It is thus AION, who springs as a Ray from Ain-Soph (who does not create), and AION, whocreates, or through whom, rather, everything is created, or evolves.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* As Mulaprakriti is known only to Iswar, the LOGOS, as he is called now by Mr. T. Subba Row, of Madras. (See his BhagavadgitaLectures.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 350 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.For, as the Basilidians taught, \"there was a supreme god, Abraxas, by whom was created mind\" (Mahat, in Sanskrit, Nous in Greek).\"From Mind proceeded the word, Logos, from the word, Providence (Divine Light, rather), then from it Virtue and Wisdom inPrincipalities, Powers, Angels, etc., etc.\" By these (Angels) the 365 AEons were created. \"Amongst the lowest, indeed, and those whomade this world, he (Basilides) sets last of all the God of the Jews, whom he denies to be God (and very rightly), affirming he is one ofthe angels\" (Ibid.). Here, then, we find the same system as in the Puranas, wherein the Incomprehensible drops a seed, whichbecomes the golden egg, from which Brahma is produced. Brahma produces Mahat, etc., etc. True Esoteric philosophy, however,speaks neither of \"creation\" nor of \"evolution\" in the sense the exoteric religions do. All these personified Powers are not evolutionsfrom one another, but so many aspects of the one and sole manifestation of the ABSOLUTE all. The same system as the gnosticprevails in the Sephirothal aspects of Ain-Soph, yet, as these aspects are in Space and Time, a certain order is maintained in theirsuccessive appearances. Therefore, it becomes impossible not to take notice of the great changes that the Zohar has undergoneunder the handling of generations of Christian Mystics. For, even in the metaphysics of the Talmud, the \"lower Face\" (or \"LesserCountenance\"), the microprosopus, in fact, could never be placed on the plane of the same abstract ideal as the Higher, or \"GreaterCountenance,\" macroprosopus. The latter is, in the Chaldean Kabala, a pure abstraction; the Word or LOGOS, or DABAR (in Hebrew),which Word, though it becomes in fact a plural number, or \"Words\" -- D(a)B(a)RIM, when it reflects itself, or falls into the aspect of aHost (of angels, or Sephiroth, \"numbers\") is still collectively ONE, and on the ideal plane a nought -- 0, a \"No-thing.\" IT is without formor being, \"with no likeness with anything else.\" (Franck, \"Die Kabbala,\" p. 126.) And even Philo calls the Creator, the Logos whostands next God, \"the SECOND GOD,\" and \"the second God who is his (Highest God's) WISDOM\" (Philo. Quaest. et Solut). Deity is notGod. It is NOTHING, and DARKNESS. It is nameless, and therefore called Ain-Soph -- \"the word Ayin meaning nothing.\" See Franck\"Die Kabbala,\" p. 153. See also Section XII., \"Theogony of the Creative Gods.\" The \"Highest God\" (the unmanifested LOGOS) is itsSon.Nor are most of the gnostic systems, which come down to us mutilated by the Church Fathers, anything better than the distorted shellsof the original speculations. Nor were they open to the public or reader, at any time; i.e., had their hidden meaning or esotericismbeen revealed, it would have been no more an esoteric teaching, and this could never be. Alone Marcus (the chief of the Marcosians,2nd century), who taught------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 351 THE GNOSTIC IDEA.that deity had to be viewed under the symbol of four syllables, gave out more of the esoteric truths than any other Gnostic. But evenhe was never well understood. For it is only on the surface or dead letter of his Revelation that it appears that God is a quaternary, towit: \"the Ineffable, the Silence, the Father, and Truth,\" -- in reality it is quite erroneous, and divulges only one more esoteric riddle.This teaching of Marcus was that of the early Kabalists and ours. For he makes of Deity, the number 30 in 4 syllables, which,translated esoterically, means a Triad or Triangle, and a Quaternary or a square, in all seven, which, on the lower plane made theseven divine or secret letters of which the God-name is composed. This requires demonstration. In his \"Revelation,\" speaking of divinemysteries expressed by means of letters and numbers, Marcus narrates how the \"Supreme Tetrad came down unto me (him) from theregion which cannot be seen nor named, in a female form, because the world would have been unable to bear her appearing undera male figure,\" and revealed to him \"the generation of the universe, untold before to either gods or men.\"This first sentence already contains a double meaning. Why should a female figure be more easily borne or listened to by the worldthan a male figure? On the very face of it this appears nonsensical. Withal it is quite simple and clear to one who is acquainted withthe mystery-language. Esoteric Philosophy, or the Secret Wisdom, was symbolized by a female form, while a male figure stood for theUnveiled mystery. Hence, the world not being ready to receive, could not bear it, and the Revelation of Marcus had to be givenallegorically. Then he writes:\"When first the Inconceivable, the Beingless and Sexless (the Kabalistic Ain-Soph) began to be in labour (i.e., when the hour ofmanifesting Itself had struck) and desired that Its Ineffable should be born (the first LOGOS, or AEon, or Aion), and its invisible should"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"be clothed with form, its mouth opened and uttered the word like unto itself. This word (logos) manifested itself in the form of theInvisible One. The uttering of the (ineffable) name (through the word) came to pass in this manner.

Then the third,composed of ten letters; and after this the fourth, which contains twelve letters. The whole name consists thus of thirty letters and offour syllables. Each letter has its own accent and way of writing, but neither understands nor ever beholds that form of the wholeName, -- no; not even the power of the letter that stands next to Itself (to the Beingless and the Inconceivable.)* All these sounds whenunited are the collective Beingless,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Iswara, or the Logos, cannot see Parabrahmam, but only Mulaprakriti, says the lecturer, in the Four Lectures on Bhagavatgita.

It is as Kabalistic, but less veiled than the Zohar in which the mystic namesor attributes are also four syllabled, twelve, forty-two, and even seventy-two syllabled words! The Tetrad shows to Marcus the TRUTHin the shape of a naked woman, and letters every limb of that figure, calling her head [[omega]], her neck [[psi]], shoulders and hands[[gamma]], and [[chi]], etc., etc. In this Sephira is easily recognised, the Crown (Kether) or head being numbered one; the brain orChochmah, 2; the heart, or Intelligence (Binah), 3; and the other seven Sephiroth representing the limbs of the body. TheSephirothal Tree is the Universe, and Adam Kadmon represents it in the West as Brahma represents it in India.Throughout, the 10 Sephiroth are represented as divided into the three higher, or the spiritual Triad, and the lower Septenary. Thetrue Esoteric meaning of the sacred number seven is cleverly veiled in the Zohar; yet was betrayed by the double way of writing \"inthe beginning\" or Be-resheeth, and Be-raishath, the latter the \"Higher, or Upper Wisdom.\" As shown by Mr. Macgregor Mathers in hisKabbalah (p. 47), and in the Qabbalah of Mr. T. Myer (p. 233), both of these Kabalists being supported by the best ancientauthorities, these words have a dual and secret meaning. Braisheeth bara Elohim means that the six, over which stands the seventhSephiroth, belong to the lower material class, or, as the author says: \"Seven . . . . are applied to the Lower Creation, and three to thespiritual man, the Heavenly Prototypic or first Adam.\"When the Theosophists and Occultists say that God is no BEING, for IT is nothing, No-Thing, they are more reverential and religiouslyrespectful to the Deity than those who call God a HE, and thus make of Him a gigantic MALE.He who studies the Kabala will soon find the same idea in the ultimate thought of its authors, the earlier and great Hebrew Initiates,who got this secret Wisdom at Babylonia from the Chaldean Hierophants, while Moses got his in Egypt. The Zohar cannot well bejudged by its after translations in Latin and other tongues, as all those ideas were, of course, softened and made to fit in with theviews and policy of its Christian arrangers; but in truth its ideas are identical with those of all other religious systems. The variousCosmogonies show that the Archaic Universal Soul was held by every nation as the \"Mind\" of the Demiurgic Creator; and that it[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The \"Seven Angels of the Face,\" with the Christians.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 353 THE EGYPTIAN VERSION.was called the \"Mother,\" Sophia with the Gnostics (or the female Wisdom), the Sephira with the Jews, Saraswati or Vach, with theHindus, the Holy Ghost being a female Principle.Hence, born from it, the Kurios or Logos was, with the Greeks, the \"God, mind\" (nous). \"Now Koros (Kurios) signifies the pure andunmixed nature of intellect -- wisdom,\" says Plato in \"Cratylus\"; and Kurios is Mercury, the Divine Wisdom, and \"mercury is the Sol\"(Sun) (\"Arnobius\" vi., xii.), from whom Thot-Hermes received this divine Wisdom. While, then, the Logoi of all countries and religionsare correlative (in their sexual aspects) with the female Soul of the World or the \"Great Deep;\" the deity, from which these two in onehave their being, is ever concealed and called the \"Hidden One,\" connected only indirectly with Creation,* as it can act only throughthe Dual Force emanating from the Eternal Essence. Even AEsculapius, called the \"Saviour of all,\" is identical, according to ancientclassics, with Phta, the Egyptian Creative Intellect (or Divine Wisdom), and with Apollo, Baal, Adonis and Hercules (see Dunlap's\"Mystery of Adonis,\" pp. 23 and 95); and Phta is, in one of its aspects, the \"Anima Mundi,\" the Universal Soul of Plato, the \"DivineSpirit\" of the Egyptians, the \"Holy Ghost\" of the early Christians and Gnostics, and the Akasa of the Hindus, and even, in its loweraspect, the Astral Light. For Phta was originally the \"God of the Dead,\" he in whose bosom they were received, hence the Limbus ofthe Greek Christians, or the Astral Light. It is far later that Phta was classed with the Sun-gods, his name signifying \"he who opens,\" ashe is shown to be the first to unveil the face of the dead mummy, to call the soul to life in his bosom. (See Maspero's \"BulaqMuseum.\") KNEPH, the Eternal Unrevealed, is represented by the snake-emblem of eternity encircling a water-urn, with its headhovering over the \"waters\" which it incubates with its breath -- another form of one and the same idea of \"Darkness,\" its ray moving onthe waters, &c. As \"Logos-Soul,\" this permutation is called Phta; as Logos-Creator, he becomes Imhot-pou, his son, \"the god of the"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"handsome face.\" In their primitive characters these two were the first Cosmic Duad, Noot, \"space or Sky,\" and Noo, \"the primordialWaters,\" the Androgyne Unity, above whom was the Concealed BREATH of Kneph. And all of them had the aquatic animals andplants sacred to them, the ibis, the swan, the goose, the crocodile, and the lotus.Returning to the Kabalistic deity, this Concealed Unity is then [[hebrew]] = [[to pan]] = [[apeiros]], Endless, Boundless, non-Existent,[[hebrew]] so[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We use the term as one accepted and sanctioned by use, and therefore more comprehensible to the reader.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 354 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.long as the Absolute is within Oulom,* the boundless and termless time, as such, En-Soph cannot be the Creator or even the modellerof the Universe, nor can he be Aur (light). Therefore En-Soph is also Darkness. The immutably Infinite and the absolutely Boundlesscan neither will, think, nor act. To do this it has to become finite, and it does so, by its ray penetrating into the mundane egg -- infinitespace -- and emanating from it as a finite god. All this is left to the ray latent in the one. When the period arrives, the absolute willexpands naturally the force within it, according to the Law of which it is the inner and ultimate Essence. The Hebrews did not adoptthe egg as a symbol, but they substituted for it the \"Duplex heavens,\" for, translated correctly, the sentence \"God made the heavensand the earth\" would read:-- \"In and out of his own essence as a womb (the mundane egg), God created the two heavens.\" But theChristians have chosen as the symbol of their Holy Ghost, the dove.\"Whosoever acquaints himself with [[hebrew]] the Mercaba and the lahgash (secret speech or incantation), will learn the secret ofsecrets.\" Lahgash is nearly identical in meaning with Vach, the hidden power of the Mantras.When the active period has arrived, from within the eternal essence of Ain-Soph, comes forth Sephira, the active Power, called thePrimordial Point, and the Crown, Kether. It is only through her that the \"Un-bounded Wisdom\" could give a concrete form to theabstract Thought. Two sides of the upper triangle by which the ineffable Essence and the universe -- its manifested body -- aresymbolized, the right side and the base are composed of unbroken lines; the third, the left side, is dotted. It is through the latter thatemerges Sephira. Spreading in every direction, she finally encompasses the whole triangle. In this emanation the triple triad isformed. From the invisible Dew falling from the higher Uni-triad (thus leaving 7 sephiroths only), the \"Head\" Sephira creates primevalwaters, i.e., Chaos takes shape. It is the first stage towards the solidification of spirit which through various modifications will produceearth. \"It requires earth and water to make a living soul,\" says Moses. It requires the image of an aquatic bird to connect it with water,the female element of procreation with the egg and the bird that fecundates it.When Sephira emerges like an active power from within the latent Deity, she is female; when she assumes the office of a creator, shebecomes a male; hence, she is androgyne. She is the \"Father and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* With the ancient Jews, as shown by Le Clerc, the word Oulom meant only a time whose beginning or end is not known.

The frog in the moon, typicalof his generative character, was the most frequent. All the birds and animals now held \"unclean\" in the Bible had been the symbols ofthe Deity in days of old. It was because they were too sacred that a mask of uncleanness was placed over them, in order to preservethem from destruction. The brazen serpent was not a bit more poetical than the goose or swan, if symbols are to be accepted a lalettre.In the words of the Zohar: \"The Indivisible Point, which has no limit and cannot be comprehended because of its purity andbrightness, expanded from without, forming a brightness that served the indivisible Point as a veil;\" yet the latter also \"could not beviewed in consequence of its immeasurable light. It too expanded from without, and this expansion was its garment. Thus through aconstant upheaving (motion) finally the world originated\" (Zohar I. 20a). The Spiritual substance sent forth by the Infinite Light is thefirst Sephira or Shekinah: Sephira exoterically contains all the other nine Sephiroths in her. Esoterically she contains but two,*Chochmah or Wisdom, \"a masculine, active potency whose divine name is Jah ([[diagram]]),\" and BINAH, a feminine passive potency,Intelligence, represented by the divine name Jehovah ([[diagram]]); which two potencies form, with Sephira the third, the Jewishtrinity or the Crown, KETHER. These two Sephiroths called Father, Abba, and Mother Amona, are the duad or the double-sexed logosfrom which issued the other seven Sephiroths. (See Zohar.) This first Jewish triad (Sephira, Chochmah, and Binah) is the HinduTrimurti.* However veiled, even in the Zohar, and more still in the exoteric Pantheon of India, every particular connected with one isreproduced in the other. The Prajapati are the Sephiroths. Ten with Brahma they dwindle to seven, when the Trimurti, and theKabalistic triad, are separated from the rest.

If Aditi is the mother of the gods, Deva-Matri,Eve is the mother of all living; they are the Sakti or generative power in their female aspect of the \"Heavenly man,\" and they are allcompound Creators. Says a \"Gupta Vidya\" Sutra: \"In the beginning, a ray issuing from Paramarthika (the one and only true existence),it became manifested in Vyavaharika (conventional existence) which was used as a Vahan to descend into the Universal Mother, andto cause her to expand (swell, brih).\" And in the Zohar it is stated: \"The Infinite Unity, formless and without similitude, after the form ofthe heavenly man was created, used it. The Unknown Light* (Darkness) used the [[hebrew]](heavenly form) as a chariot [[hebrew]]through which to descend, and wished to be called by this form, which is the sacred name Jehovah.\"As the Zohar says: \"In the beginning was the Will of the King, prior to any other existence. . . . It (the Will) sketched the forms of allthings that had been concealed but now came into view. And there went forth as a sealed secret from the head of Ain Soph, anebulous spark of matter, without shape or form. . . . Life is drawn from below, and from above the source renews itself, the sea isalways full and spreads its waters everywhere.\" Thus the deity is compared to a shoreless sea, to water which is \"the fountain of life\"(Zohar iii., 290). \"The seventh palace, the fountain of life, is the first in the order from above\" (ii. 261). Hence the Kabalistic tenet onthe lips of the very Kabalistic Solomon, who says in Proverbs ix., 1: \"Wisdom hath builded her house; it hath hewn out its sevenpillars.\"Whence then, all this identity of ideas, if there was no primeval UNIVERSAL Revelation? The few points shown are like a few straws ina hayrick, in comparison to that which will be shown as the work proceeds. If we turn to that most hazy of all Cosmogonies -- theChinese, even there the same idea is found. Tsi-tsai (the Self-Existent) is the unknown Darkness, the root of the Wuliang-sheu(Boundless Age), Amitabhe, and Tien (heaven) come later on.

If we turn to Chaldea we find in itAnu, the concealed deity, the One, whose name, moreover, shows it to be of Sanskrit origin. Anu, which means in Sanskrit \"atom,\"aniyamsam aniyasam (smallest of the small), is a name of Parabrahm in the Vedantic philosophy; Parabrahm being described assmaller than the smallest atom, and greater than the greatest sphere or universe: \"Anagraniyam and Mahatorvavat.\" This is whatGeorge Smith gives as the first verses of the Akkadian Genesis as found in the Cuneiform Texts on the \"Lateras Coctiles.\" There also,we find Anu the passive deity or En-Soph, Bel, the Creator, the Spirit of God (Sephira) moving on the face of the waters, hence wateritself, and Hea, the Universal Soul or wisdom of the three combined.The first eight verses read thus:1. When above, were not raised the heavens;2. And below on the earth a plant had not grown up.3. The abyss had not broken its boundaries.4.

A goose,or even a swan, may appear unfit, no doubt, to represent the grandeur of the Spirit. Nevertheless, it must have had some deep occultmeaning, since it figures not only in every cosmogony and world religion, but even was chosen by the mediaeval Christians, theCrusaders, as the vehicle of the Holy Ghost supposed to lead the army to Palestine, to wrench the Tomb of the Saviour from thehands of the Saracen. If we are to credit Professor Draper's statement in his \"Intellectual Development of Europe,\" the Crusaders, ledon by Peter the Hermit, were preceded, at the head of the army, by the Holy Ghost under the shape of a white gander in company ofa goat. The Egyptian God of Time, Seb, carries a goose on his head. Jupiter assumes the form of a swan and Brahma also, becausethe root of all this is that mystery of mysteries -- the MUNDANE EGG.

The dual element of Air and Water is that of the ibis, swan, gooseand pelican, of crocodiles and frogs, lotus flowers and water lilies, &c.; and the result is the choice of the most unseemly symbolsamong the modern as much as the ancient mystics. Pan, the great god of nature, was generally figured in connection with aquaticbirds, geese especially, and so were other gods. If, later on, with the gradual degeneration of religion, the gods to whom geese weresacred, became Priapic deities, it does not stand to reason that water fowls were made sacred to Pan and other Phallic deities assome scoffers even of antiquity would have it (see Petronii Satyrica, cxxxvi.); but that the abstract and divine power of procreativenature had become grossly anthropomorphized. Nor does the Swan of Leda show \"Priapic doings and her enjoyment thereof,\" as Mr.Hargrave Jennings chastely expresses it -- for the myth is but another version of the same philosophical idea of cosmogony. Swans arefrequently found associated with Apollo, as they are the emblems of water and fire (sun-light also), before the separation of theElements.Our modern symbologists might profit by some remarks made by a well-known writer, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child. \"From time immemorialan emblem has been worshipped in Hindostan as the type of creation, or the origin of life. . . . Siva or the Mahadeva being not onlythe reproducer of human forms, but also the fructifying principle, the generative power that pervades the Universe. The maternalemblem is likewise a religious type. This reverence for the production of life, introduced into the worship of Osiris the sexual emblems.Is it strange that they regarded with reverence the great mystery of human birth? Were they impure thus to regard it? Or are we impurethat do not so regard it? But no clean and thoughtful mind could so regard them. . . . We have travelled far, and unclean have beenthe paths, since those old Anchorites first spoke of God and the soul in the solemn depths of their first sanctuaries. Let us not smile attheir mode of tracing the infinite and the incomprehensible Cause throughout all the mysteries of nature, lest by so doing we cast theshadow of our own grossness on their patriarchal simplicity.\" (\"Progress of Religious Ideas,\" Vol. 1, p. 17, et seq.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 359 THE EGG-BORN GOD.§ VI.THE MUNDANE EGG.WHENCE this universal symbol? The Egg was incorporated as a sacred sign in the cosmogony of every people on the Earth, and wasrevered both on account of its form and its inner mystery. From the earliest mental conceptions of man, it was known as that whichrepresented most successfully the origin and secret of being. The gradual development of the imperceptible germ within the closedshell; the inward working, without any apparent outward interference of force, which from a latent nothing produced an activesomething, needing nought save heat; and which, having gradually evolved into a concrete, living creature, broke its shell, appearingto the outward senses of all a self-generated, and self-created being -- must have been a standing miracle from the beginning.The secret teaching explains the reason for this reverence by the Symbolism of the prehistoric races. The \"First Cause\" had no namein the beginnings. Later it was pictured in the fancy of the thinkers as an ever invisible, mysterious Bird that dropped an Egg intoChaos, which Egg becomes the Universe. Hence Brahm was called Kalahansa, \"the swan in (Space and) Time.\" He became the\"Swan of Eternity,\" who lays at the beginning of each Mahamanvantara a \"Golden Egg.\" It typifies the great Circle, or O, itself asymbol for the universe and its spherical bodies.The second reason for its having been chosen as the symbolical representation of the Universe, and of our earth, was its form. It was aCircle and a Sphere; and the ovi-form shape of our globe must have been known from the beginning of symbology, since it was souniversally adopted. The first manifestation of the Kosmos in the form of an egg was the most widely diffused belief of antiquity. AsBryant shows (iii., 165), it was a symbol adopted among the Greeks, the Syrians, Persians, and Egyptians. In chap. liv. of the EgyptianRitual, Seb, the god of Time and of the Earth, is spoken of as having laid an egg, or the Universe, \"an egg conceived at the hour ofthe great one of the Dual Force\" (Sec. V., 2, 3, etc.)."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Ra is shown like Brahma gestating in the Egg of the Universe. The deceased is \"resplendent in the Egg of the land of mysteries\" (xxii.,1).

Faber and Bryant have tried to show that the egg typified the ark of Noah, which, unless the latter is accepted aspurely allegorical and symbolical, is a wild belief. It can have typified the ark only as a synonym of the moon, the argha which carriesthe universal seed of life; but had surely nothing to do with the ark of the Bible. Anyhow, the belief that the universe existed in thebeginning in the shape of an egg was general. And as Wilson has it: \"A similar account of the first aggregation of the elements in theform of an egg is given in all the (Indian) Puranas, with the usual epithet Haima or Hiranya, 'golden' as it occurs in Manu.\" Hiranya,however, means \"resplendent,\" \"shining,\" rather than \"golden,\" as proven by the great Indian scholar, the late Swami DayanandSarasvati, in his unpublished polemics with Professor Max Muller. As said in the Vishnu Purana: \"Intellect (Mahat) . . . the(unmanifested) gross elements inclusive, formed an egg . . . and the lord of the Universe himself abided in it, in the character ofBrahma. In that egg, O Brahman, were the continents, and seas and mountains, the planets and divisions of the universe, the gods,the demons and mankind.\" (Book i., ch. 2.) Both in Greece and in India the first visible male being, who united in himself the natureof either sex, abode in the egg and issued from it. This \"first born of the world\" was Dionysius, with some Greeks; the god who sprangfrom the mundane egg, and from whom the mortals and immortals were derived. The god Ra is shown in the Ritual (Book of theDead, xvii., 50) beaming in his egg (the Sun), and he starts off as soon as the god Shoo (the Solar energy) awakens and gives him theimpulse. \"He is in the Solar egg, the egg to which is given life among the gods\" (Ibid., xlii., 13). The Solar god exclaims: \"I am thecreative soul of the celestial abyss. None sees my nest, none can break my egg, I am the Lord!\" (Ibid., LXXXV.).In view of this circular form, the \"|\" issuing from the \"[[diagram]],\" or the egg, or the male from the female in the androgyne, it isstrange to find a scholar saying -- on the ground that the most ancient Indian MSS. show no trace of it -- that the ancient Aryans wereignorant of the decimal notation. The 10, being the sacred number of the universe, was secret and esoteric, both as the unit andcipher, or zero, the circle. Moreover, Professor Max Muller says that \"the two words cipher and zero, which are but one, are sufficient toprove that our figures are borrowed from the Arabs.* Cipher is the Arabic \"cifron,\" and means[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Max Muller's \"Our Figures.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 361 WHENCE OUR FIGURES?empty, a translation of the Sanscrit name of nought \"sunya,\" he says.* The Arabs had their figures from Hindustan, and never claimedthe discovery for themselves.** As to the Pythagoreans, we need but turn to the ancient manuscripts of Boethius's Geometry,composed in the sixth century, to find among the Pythagorean numerals*** the 1 and the nought, as the first and final ciphers. AndPorphyry, who quotes from the Pythagorean Moderatus,**** says that the numerals of Pythagoras were \"hieroglyphical symbols, bymeans whereof he explained ideas concerning the nature of things,\" or the origin of the universe.Now, if, on the other hand, the most ancient Indian manuscripts show as yet no trace of decimal notation in them, and Max Mullerstates very clearly that until now he has found but nine letters (the initials of the Sanscrit numerals) in them; on the other hand, wehave records as ancient to supply the wanted proof. We speak of the sculptures and the sacred imagery in the most ancient temples ofthe far East. Pythagoras derived his knowledge from India; and we find Professor Max Muller corroborating this statement, at least sofar as to allow the Neo-Pythagoreans to have been the first teachers of \"ciphering,\" among the Greeks and Romans; that \"they atAlexandria, or in Syria, became acquainted with the Indian figures, and adapted them to the Pythagorean abacus\" (our figures). Thiscautious admission implies that Pythagoras himself was acquainted with but nine figures. Thus we might reasonably answer that,although we possess no certain proof (exoterically) that the decimal notation was known by Pythagoras, who lived on the very close ofthe archaic ages,***** we have yet sufficient evidence to show that the full numbers, as given by Boethius, were known to thePythagoreans, even before Alexandria was built.****** This evidence we find in Aristotle, who says that \"some philosophers hold thatideas and numbers are of the same nature, and amount to TEN in all.\"******* This, we believe, will be sufficient to show that thedecimal notation was known among them at least as early as four centuries B.C., for Aristotle does not seem to treat the question asan innovation of the \"Neo-Pythagoreans.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* A Kabalist would be rather inclined to believe that as the Arabic cifron was taken from the Indian Synya, nought, so the JewishKabalistic Sephiroth (Sephrim) were taken from the word cipher, not in the sense of emptiness but the reverse -- that of creation bynumber and degrees in their evolution. And the Sephiroth are 10 or [[diagram]].** See Max Muller's \"Our Figures.\"*** See King's \"Gnostics and their Remains,\" plate xiii."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"**** \"Vita Pythag.\"***** 608 B.C.****** This city was built 332 B.C.******* \"Metaph.\" vii., F.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 362 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.But we know more than that: we know that the decimal system must have been known to the mankind of the earliest archaic ages,since the whole astronomical and geometrical portion of the secret sacerdotal language was built upon the number 10, or thecombination of the male and female principles, and since the Pyramid of \"Cheops\" is built upon the measures of this decimalnotation, or rather upon the digits and their combinations with the nought. Of this, however, sufficient was said in Isis Unveiled, and itis useless to repeat and return to the same subject.The symbolism of the Lunar and Solar Deities is so inextricably mixed up, that it is next to impossible to separate such glyphs as theegg, the lotus, and the \"sacred\" animals from each other. The ibis, for instance, sacred to Isis, who is often represented with the headof that bird, sacred also to Mercury or Thoth, because that god assumed its form while escaping from Typhon, -- the ibis was held inthe greatest veneration in Egypt. There were two kinds of ibises, Herodotus tells us (Lib. II. c. 75 et seq.) in that country: one quiteblack, the other black and white. The former is credited with fighting and exterminating the winged serpents which came every springfrom Arabia and infested the country. The other was sacred to the moon, because the latter planet is white and brilliant on herexternal side, dark and black on that side which she never turns to the earth. Moreover, the ibis kills land serpents, and makes the mostterrible havoc amongst the eggs of the crocodile, and thus saves Egypt from having the Nile infested by those horrible Saurians. Thebird is credited with doing so in the moonlight, and thus being helped by Isis, as the moon, her sidereal symbol. But the neareresoteric truth underlying these popular myths is, that Hermes, as shown by Abenephius (De cultu Egypt.), watched under the form ofthat bird over the Egyptians, and taught them the occult arts and sciences. This means simply that the ibis religiosa had and has\"magical\" properties in common with many other birds, the albatross pre-eminently, and the mythical white swan, the swan of Eternityor Time, the KALAHANSA.Were it otherwise, indeed, why should all the ancient peoples, who were no more fools than we are, have had such a superstitiousdread of killing certain birds? In Egypt, he who killed an ibis, or the golden hawk -- the symbol of the Sun and Osiris -- risked and couldhardly escape death. The veneration of some nations for birds was such that Zoroaster, in his precepts, forbids their slaughter as aheinous crime. We laugh in our age at every kind of divination. Yet why should so many generations have believed in divination bybirds, and even in zoomancy, said by Suidas to have been imparted by Orpheus, who taught how to perceive in the yoke and white of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 363 EGG-BORN LOGOI.the egg, under certain conditions, that which the bird born from it would have seen around it during its short life. This occult art, whichdemanded 3,000 years ago the greatest learning and the most abstruse mathematical calculations, has now fallen into the depths ofdegradation: it is old cooks and fortune-tellers who read their future to servant-girls in search of husbands, by means of the white of anegg in a glass.Nevertheless, even Christians have to this day their sacred birds; for instance, the dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost. Nor have theyneglected the sacred animals. The Evangelical zoolatry -- the Bull, the Eagle, the Lion, and the Angel (in reality the Cherub, orSeraph, the fiery-winged Serpent), is as much pagan as that of the Egyptians or the Chaldeans. These four animals are, in reality, thesymbols of the four elements, and of the four lower principles in man. Nevertheless, they correspond physically and materially to thefour constellations that form, so to speak, the suite or cortege of the Solar God, and occupy during the winter solstice the four cardinalpoints of the zodiacal circle. These four \"animals\" may be seen in many of the Roman Catholic New Testaments where the portraits ofthe evangelists are given. They are the animals of Ezekiel's Mercabah.As truly stated by Ragon, \"the ancient Hierophants have combined so cleverly the dogmas and symbols of their religious philosophies,that these symbols can be fully explained only by the combination and knowledge of all the keys.\" They can be only approximatelyinterpreted, even if one finds out three out of these seven systems: the anthropological, the psychic, and the astronomical. The twochief interpretations, the highest and the lowest, the spiritual and the physiological, they preserved in the greatest secrecy until thelatter fell into the dominion of the profane. Thus far, with regard only to the pre-historic Hierophants, with whom that which has nowbecome purely (or impurely) phallic, was a science as profound and as mysterious as biology and physiology are now. This was theirexclusive property, the fruit of their studies and discoveries. The other two were those which dealt with the creative gods (theogony),and with creative man, i.e., the ideal and the practical mysteries. These interpretations were so cleverly veiled and combined, thatmany were those who, while arriving at the discovery of one meaning, were baffled in understanding the significance of the others,and could never unriddle them sufficiently to commit dangerous indiscretions. The highest, the first and the fourth -- theogony inrelation to anthropogony -- were almost impossible to fathom. We find the proofs of this in the Jewish \"Holy Writ.\"It is owing to the serpent being oviparous, that it became a symbol of wisdom and an emblem of the Logoi, or the self-born. In thetemple of Philoe in Upper Egypt, an egg was artificially prepared of clay made of"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 364 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.various incenses, and it was made to hatch by a peculiar process, when a cerastes (the horned viper) was born. The same was done inantiquity for the cobra in the Indian temples. The creative God emerges from the egg that issues from the mouth of Kneph -- as awinged serpent -- because the Serpent is the symbol of the All-wisdom. With the Hebrews he is glyphed by the \"flying or fiery serpents\"of the Wilderness and Moses, and with the Alexandrian mystics he becomes the Ophio-Christos, the Logos of the Gnostics. TheProtestants try to show that the allegory of the Brazen Serpent and of the \"fiery serpents\" has a direct reference to the mystery of Christand Crucifixion*; but it has a far nearer relation, in truth, to the mystery of generation, when dissociated from the egg with the centralgerm, or the circle with its central point. The brazen Serpent had no such holy meaning as that; nor was it, in fact, glorified above the\"fiery serpents\" for the bite of which it was only a natural remedy. The symbological meaning of the word \"brazen\" being the feminineprinciple, and that of fiery, or \"gold,\" the male one.**In the Book of the Dead, as just shown, reference is often made to the Egg. Ra, the mighty one, remains in his Egg, during thestruggle between the \"children of the rebellion\" and Shoo (the Solar Energy and the Dragon of Darkness) (ch. xvii.). The deceased isresplendent in his[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* And this only because the brazen serpent was lifted on a pole! It had rather a reference to Mico the Egyptian egg standing uprightsupported by the sacred Tau; since the Egg and the Serpent are inseparable in the old worship and symbology of Egypt, and sinceboth the Brazen and \"fiery\" serpents were Saraphs, the \"burning fiery\" messengers, or the serpent Gods, the nagas of India. It was apurely phallic symbol without the egg, while when associated with it -- it related to cosmic creation.** \"Brass was a metal symbolizing the nether world . . . . that of the womb where life should be given . . . The word for serpent was inHebrew Nakash, but this is the same term for brass.\" It is said in Numbers (xxi.) that the Jews complained of the Wilderness where therewas no water (v. 5); after which \"the Lord sent fiery serpents\" to bite them, when, to oblige Moses, he gives him as a remedy thebrazen serpent on a pole to look at; after which \"any man when he beheld the serpent of brass . . . . lived\" (?). After that the \"Lord,\"gathering the people together at the well of Beer, gives them water, (14-16), and grateful Israel sang this song, \"Spring up, O Well,\"(v. 17). When, after studying symbology, the Christian reader comes to understand the innermost meaning of these three symbols --water, brazen, the serpent, and a few more -- in the sense given to them in the Holy Bible, he will hardly like to connect the sacredname of his Saviour with the \"Brazen Serpent\" incident. The Seraphim [[hebrew]] (fiery winged serpents) are no doubt connectedwith, and inseparable from, the idea \"of the serpent of eternity -- God,\" as explained in Kenealy's Apocalypse. But the word cherubalso meant serpent, in one sense, though its direct meaning is different; because the Cherubim and the Persian winged [[gruphes]]\"griffins\" -- the guardians of the golden mountain -- are the same, and their compound name shows their character, as it is formed of[[hebrew]] (kr) circle, and [[hebrew]] \"aub,\" or ob -- serpent -- therefore, a \"serpent in a circle.\" And this settles the phallic character ofthe Brazen Serpent, and justifies Hezekiah for breaking it.

He is the Egg of Seb (liv. 1-3). . . . The Egg was the symbol of life in immortalityand eternity; as also the glyph of the generative matrix; and the tau, associated with it, only of life and birth in generation. TheMundane Egg was placed in Khnoom, the \"Water of Space,\" or the feminine abstract principle (Khnoom becoming, with the fall ofmankind into generation and phallicism, Ammon, the creative God); and when Phtah, the \"fiery god,\" carries the Mundane egg in hishand, then the symbolism becomes quite terrestrial and concrete in its significance. In conjunction with the hawk, the symbol of Osiris-Sun, the symbol is dual: it relates to both lives -- the mortal and the immortal. In Kircher's OEdipus Egyptiacus (vol. iii., p. 124) onecan see, on the papyrus engraved in it, an egg floating above the mummy. This is the symbol of hope and the promise of a secondbirth for the Osirified dead; his Soul, after due purification in the Amenti, will gestate in this egg of immortality, to be reborn from itinto a new life on earth. For this Egg, in the esoteric Doctrine, is the Devachan, the abode of Bliss; the winged scarabeus being alike asymbol of it. The \"winged globe\" is but another form of the egg, and has the same significance as the scarabeus, the Khopiroo (fromthe root Khoproo \"to become,\" \"to be reborn,\") which relates to the rebirth of man, as well as to his spiritual regeneration.In the Theogony of Mochus, we find AEther first, and then the air, from which Ulom, the intelligible ([[noetos]]) deity (the visibleUniverse of Matter) is born out of the Mundane Egg. (Mover's Phoinizer, p. 282.)In the Orphic Hymns, the Eros-Phanes evolves from the divine Egg, which the AEthereal Winds impregnate, wind being \"the Spirit ofthe unknown Darkness\" -- \"the spirit of God\" (as explains K. O. Muller, 236); the divine \"Idea,\" says Plato, \"who is said to moveAEther.\"In the Hindu Katakopanishad, Purusha, the divine spirit, already stands before the original matter, \"from whose union springs the greatsoul of the world,\" Maha-Atma, Brahma, the Spirit of Life,* etc., etc.** Besides this there are many charming allegories on this subjectscattered through the sacred books of the Brahmins. In one place it is the female creator who is first a germ, then a drop of heavenlydew, a pearl, and then an egg. In such cases -- of which there are too many to enumerate them separately -- the Egg gives birth to thefour elements within the fifth, Ether, and is covered with seven coverings, which become later on the seven upper and the seven lowerworlds.

Then again, it is Vishnu who emerges from within the egg with a lotus in his hand. Vinata, a daughter of Daksha and wifeof Kasyapa (\"the Self-born sprung from Time,\" one of the seven \"creators\" of our world), brought forth an egg from which was bornGaruda, the vehicle of Vishnu, the latter allegory having a relation to our Earth only, as Garuda is the Great Cycle.The egg was sacred to Isis; the priests of Egypt never ate eggs on that account.*Diodorus Siculus states that Osiris was born from an Egg, like Brahma. From Leda's Egg Apollo and Latona were born, as also Castorand Pollux -- the bright Gemini. And though the Buddhists do not attribute the same origin to their Founder, yet, no more than theancient Egyptians or the modern Brahmins, do they eat eggs, lest they should destroy the germ of life latent in them, and committhereby Sin. The Chinese believe that their first man was born from an egg, which Tien, a god, dropped down from heaven to earthinto the waters.** This symbol is still regarded by some as representing the idea of the origin of life, which is a scientific truth, thoughthe human ovum is invisible to the naked eye. Therefore we see respect shown to it from the remotest past, by the Greeks,Phoenicians, Romans, the Japanese, and the Siamese, the North and South American tribes, and even the savages of the remotestislands.With the Egyptians, the concealed god was Ammon (Mon). All their gods were dual: the scientific reality for the Sanctuary; its double,the fabulous and mythical Entity, for the masses. For instance, as observed in \"Chaos, Theos, Kosmos,\" the older Horus was the Ideaof the world remaining in the demiurgic mind \"born in Darkness before the creation of the world;\" the second Horus*** was the sameIdea going forth from the Logos, becoming clothed with matter and assuming an actual existence. (Compare Mover's \"Phoinizer,\" p.268.) The same with Khnoum and Ammon;**** both are represented ram-headed, and both often confused, though their functions aredifferent. Khnoum is \"the modeller of men,\" fashioning men and things out of the Mundane Egg on a potter's wheel;[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Isis is almost always represented holding a lotus in one hand and in the other a circle and the Cross (crux ansata), the Egg beingsacred to her.** The Chinese seem to have thus anticipated Sir William Thomson's theory that the first living germ had dropped to the Earth fromsome passing comet. Query! why should this be called scientific and the Chinese idea a superstitious, foolish theory?*** Horus -- the \"older,\" or Haroiri, is an ancient aspect of the solar god, contemporary with Ra and Shoo; Haroiri is often mistaken forHor (Horsusi), Son of Osiris and Isis. The Egyptians very often represented the rising Sun under the form of Hor the older, rising from afull-blown lotus, the Universe, when the solar disc is always found on the hawk-head of that god. Haroiri is Khnoum.**** Ammon or Mon, the \"hidden,\" the Supreme Spirit.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 367 THE SCANDINAVIAN LOGOS.Ammon-Ra, the generator, is the secondary aspect of the concealed deity. Khnoum was adored at Elephanta and Philoe,* Ammon atThebes. But it is Emepht, the One, Supreme Planetary principle, who blows the egg out of his mouth, and who is, therefore, Brahma.The shadow of the deity, Kosmic and universal, of that which broods over and permeates the egg with its vivifying Spirit until thegerm contained in it is ripe, was the mystery god whose name was unpronounceable. It is Phtah, however, \"he who opens,\" theopener of life and Death,** who proceeds from the egg of the world to begin his dual work. (Book of Numbers.)According to the Greeks, the phantom form of the Chemis (Chemi, ancient Egypt) which floats on the ethereal waves of the EmpyreanSphere, was called into being by Horus-Apollo, the Sun god, who caused it to evolve out of the Mundane egg.***In the Scandinavian Cosmogony -- placed by Professor Max Muller, in point of time, as \"far anterior to the Vedas\" in the poem ofVoluspa (the song of the prophetess), the Mundane egg is again discovered in the phantom-germ of the Universe, which isrepresented as lying in the Ginnungagap -- the cup of illusion (Maya) the boundless and void abyss. In this world's matrix, formerly aregion of night and desolation, Nebelheim (the mist-place, the nebular as it is called now, in the astral light) dropped a ray of coldlight which overflowed this cup and froze in it. Then the Invisible blew a scorching wind which dissolved the frozen waters and clearedthe mist. These waters (chaos), called the streams of Elivagar, distilling in vivifying drops, fell down and created the earth and thegiant Ymir, who only had \"the semblance of man\" (the Heavenly man), and the cow, Audhumla (the \"mother\" or astral light, CosmicSoul) from whose udder flowed four streams of milk (the four cardinal points: the four heads of the four rivers of Eden, etc., etc.) andwhich \"four\" allegorically are symbolized by the cube in all its various and mystical meanings."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Christians -- especially the Greek and Latin Churches -- have fully adopted the symbol, and see in it a commemoration of lifeeternal,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* His triadic goddesses are Sati and Anouki.** Phtah was originally the god of death, of destruction, like Siva. He is a solar god only by virtue of the sun's fire killing as well asvivifying. He was the national god of Memphis, the radiant and \"fair-faced God.\" (See Saqquarah Bronzes, Saitic Epoch.)*** The Brahmanda Purana contains the mystery about Brahma's golden egg fully; and this is why, perhaps, it is inaccessible to theOrientalists, who say that this Purana, like the Skanda, is \"no longer procurable in a collective body,\" but \"is represented by a varietyof Khandas and Mahatmyas professing to be derived from it.\" The \"Brahmanda Purana\" is described as \"that which is declared in12,200 verses, the magnificence of the egg of Brahma, and in which an account of the future Kalpas is contained as revealed byBrahma.\" Quite so, and much more, perchance.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 368 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of salvation and of resurrection. This is found in and corroborated by the time-honoured custom of exchanging \"Easter Eggs.\" Fromthe anguinum, the \"Egg\" of the \"pagan\" Druid, whose name alone made Rome tremble with fear, to the red Easter Egg of theSlavonian peasant, a cycle has passed. And yet, whether in civilized Europe, or among the abject savages of Central America, wefind the same archaic, primitive thought; if we only search for it and do not disfigure -- in the haughtiness of our fancied mental andphysical superiority -- the original idea of the symbol.--------------§ VII.THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF BRAHMA.THIS is the name given to the Periods called MANVANTARA (Manuantara, or between the Manus) and PRALAYA (Dissolution); onereferring to the active periods of the Universe, the other to its times of relative and complete rest -- according to whether they occur atthe end of a \"Day,\" or an \"Age\" (a life) of Brahma. These periods, which follow each other in regular succession, are also calledKalpas, small and great, the minor and the Maha Kalpa; though, properly speaking, the Maha Kalpa is never a \"day,\" but a whole lifeor age of Brahma, for it is said in the Brahma Vaivarta: \"Chronologers compute a Kalpa by the Life of Brahma; minor Kalpas, asSamvarta and the rest, are numerous.\" In sober truth they are infinite; as they have never had a commencement, i.e., there never wasa first Kalpa, nor will there ever be a last one, in Eternity.One Parardha -- in the ordinary acceptation of this measure of time -- or half of the existence of Brahma (in the present Maha Kalpa)has already expired; the last Kalpa was the Padma, or that of the Golden Lotos; the present one being Varaha* (the \"boar\"incarnation, or Avatar).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* There is a curious piece of information in the Buddhist esoteric traditions. The exoteric or allegorical biography of Gautama Buddhashows this great Sage dying of an indigestion of pork and rice, a very prosaic end, indeed, having little of the solemn element in it.This is explained as an allegorical reference to his having been born in the \"Boar,\" or Varaha-Kalpa when Brahma assumed the formof that animal to raise the Earth out of the \"Waters of Space.\" And as the Brahmins descend direct from Brahma and are, so to speak,identified with him; and as they are at the same time the mortal enemies of Buddha and Buddhism, we have the curious allegoricalhint and combination. Brahminism (of the Boar, or Varaha Kalpa) has slaughtered the religion of Buddha in India, swept it away fromits face; therefore Buddha, identified with his philosophy, is said to have died from the effects of eating of the flesh of a wild hog.[[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 369 HUMAN GODS AND DIVINE MEN.By the scholar who studies the Hindu religion from the Puranas, one thing is to be especially noted. He must not take literally, and inone sense only, the statements therein found; since those which especially concern the Manvantaras or Kalpas have to be understoodin their several references. So, for instance, these periods relate in the same language to both the great and the small periods, toMaha Kalpas and to minor Cycles. The Matsya, or Fish Avatar, happened before the Varaha or Boar Avatar; the allegories, therefore,must relate to both the Padma and the present manvantara, and also to the minor cycles which took place since the reappearance ofour Chain of Worlds and Earth. And, as the Matsya Avatar of Vishnu and Vaivasvata's Deluge are correctly connected with an eventthat happened on our Earth during this Round, it is evident that while it may relate to pre-cosmic events (in the sense of our Kosmosor Solar system) it has reference in our case to a distant geological period. Not even Esoteric philosophy can claim to know, except byanalogical inference, that which took place before the reappearance of our Solar System and previous to the last Maha Pralaya. Butit teaches distinctly that after the first geological disturbance in the Earth's axis which ended in the sweeping down to the bottom ofthe Seas of the whole second Continent, with its primeval races -- of which successive \"Earths\" or Continents Atlantis was the fourth --there came another disturbance by the axis resuming as rapidly its previous degree of inclination; when the Earth was indeed raised"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"once more out of the Waters, and -- as above so it is below; and vice versa. There were \"gods\" on Earth in those days -- gods, and notmen, as we know them now, says the tradition. As will be shown in Book II., the computation of periods in exoteric Hinduism refers toboth the great cosmic and the small terrestrial events and cataclysms, and the same may be shown for names. For instanceYudishthira -- the first King of the Sacea, who opens the Kali Yuga era, which has to last 432,000 years -- \"an actual King and manwho lived 3,102 years B.C.,\" applies also, name and all, to the great Deluge at the time of the first sinking of Atlantis.

But this explanation, unveiling the allegory, explains all the rest. The Varaha, however, is nosimple boar, and seems to have meant at first some antediluvian lacustrine animal \"delighting to sport in water.\" (Vayu Purana.)* According to Colonel Wilford, the conclusion of the \"Great War\" was B.C. 1370. (See A. R., Vol.9, p. 116); according to Bentley, 575B.C.!! We may hope, perhaps, that before the end of this century, the Mahabharatean epics will be found and proclaimed identicalwith the wars of the great Napoleon.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 370 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the world beyond which nobody can go\" and \"immediately after the flood.\" (See Royal Asiat. Soc., Vol. 9, p. 364.) We know of no\"Flood\" 3,102 years B.C. -- not even that of Noah, for, agreeably with Judaeo-Christian chronology, it took place 2,349 years B.C.This relates to an esoteric division of time and a mystery explained elsewhere, and may therefore be left aside for the present. Sufficeto remark at this juncture that all the efforts of imagination of the Wilfords, Bentleys, and other would-be OEdipuses of esoteric HinduChronology have sadly failed. No computation of either the Four Ages, or the Manvantaras, has ever been unriddled by our verylearned Orientalists, who have therefore cut the Gordian Knot by proclaiming the whole \"a figment of the Brahmanical brain.\" So beit, and may the great scholars rest in peace. This \"figment\" is given in the Preliminary Sections which preface Anthropogenesis inBook II., and with esoteric additions.Let us see, however, what were the three kinds of pralayas, and what is the popular belief about them. For once it agrees withEsotericism.Of the pralaya before which fourteen Manvantaras elapse, having over them as many presiding Manus, and at whose close occurs the\"incidental\" or Brahma's dissolution, it is said in Vishnu Purana, in condensed form, that \"at the end of a thousand periods of fourages, which complete a day of Brahma, the earth is almost exhausted. The eternal Avyaya (Vishnu) assumes then the character ofRudra (the destroyer, Siva) and re-unites all his creatures to himself. He enters the Seven rays of the Sun and drinks up all the watersof the globe; he causes the moisture to evaporate, thus drying up the whole Earth. Oceans and rivers, torrents and small streams, areall exhaled. Thus fed with abundant moisture the seven solar rays become sevens suns by dilation, and they finally set the world onfire. Hari, the destroyer of all things, who is 'the flame of time, Kalagni,' finally consumes the Earth. Then Rudra, becomingJanardana, breathes clouds and rain.\"There are many kinds of Pralaya, but three chief ones are specially mentioned in old Hindu books; and of these, as Wilson shows:--The first is called NAIMITTIKA* \"occasional\" or \"incidental,\" caused by the intervals of \"Brahma's Days;\" it is the destruction ofcreatures, of all that lives and has a form, but not of the substance which remains in statu quo till the new DAWN in that \"Night.\" The[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the Vedanta and Nyaya \"nimitta\" (from which \"Naimittika\") is rendered as the efficient cause, when antithesized with upadana thephysical or material cause. In the Sankhya pradhana is a cause inferior to Brahma, or rather Brahma being himself a cause, is superiorto Pradhana. Hence \"incidental\" is wrongly translated, and ought to be translated, as shown by some scholars, \"Ideal\" cause, andeven real cause would have been better.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 371 THE RE-BIRTH OF GODS.other is called PRAKRITIKA -- and occurs at the end of the Age or Life of Brahma, when everything that exists is resolved into theprimal element, to be remodelled at the end of that longer night. But the third, Atyantika, does not concern the Worlds or theUniverse, but only the individualities of some people; it is thus individual pralaya or NIRVANA; after having reached which, there is nomore future existence possible, no rebirth till after the Maha Pralaya. The latter night, lasting as it does 311,040,000,000,000 years,and having the possibility of being almost doubled in case the lucky Jivanmukti reaches Nirvana at an early period of a Manvantara,is long enough to be regarded as eternal, if not endless. The Bhagavata (XII., iv, 35) speaks of a fourth kind of pralaya, the Nitya orconstant dissolution, and explains it as the change which takes place imperceptibly in everything in this Universe from the globe downto the atom -- without cessation. It is growth and decay (life and death).When the Maha Pralaya arrives, the inhabitants of Swar-loka (the upper sphere) disturbed by the conflagration, seek refuge \"with thePitris, their progenitors, the Manus, the Seven Rishis, the various orders of celestial Spirits and the Gods, in Maharloka.\" When the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"latter is reached also, the whole of the above enumerated beings migrate in their turn from Maharloka, and repair to Jana-loka in\"their subtile forms, destined to become re-embodied, in similar capacities as their former, when the world is renewed at thebeginning of the succeeding Kalpa;\" (Vayu Purana).\" . . . . These clouds, mighty in size, and loud in thunder, fill up all space (Nabhas-tala),\" goes on Vishnu Purana. -- (Book VI., ch. iii.)\"Showering down torrents of water, these clouds quench the dreadful fires, and then they rain uninterruptedly for a hundred (divine)years, and deluge the whole world (Solar System).

When the waters have reached the region of the Seven Rishis, andthe world (our Solar System) is one ocean, they stop. The breath of Vishnu becomes a strong wind, which blows for another hundred(divine) years until all clouds are dispersed. The wind is then reabsorbed: and \"THAT, of which all things are made, the Lord by whomall things exist, He who is inconceivable, without beginning, the beginning of the universe, reposes, sleeping upon Sesha (theSerpent of Infinity) in the midst of the deep.

Hari, sleeps upon the ocean of Space in the form of Brahma -- glorified by Sanaka* and the Siddha (Saints) of Jana-loka,and contemplated by the holy denizens of Brahma-loka, anxious for final liberation, involved in mystic slumber, the celestialpersonification of his own illusions. . . .\" This is the Pratisanchara (dissolution?) termed incidental because Hari is its incidental (ideal)Cause. . . . .** When the Universal Spirit wakes, the world revives; when he closes his eyes, all things fall upon the bed of mysticslumber. In like manner, as 1,000 great ages constitute a Day of Brahma (in the original it is Padma-yoni, the same as Abjayoni --\"lotos-born,\" not Brahma), so his Night consists of the same period. \"Awaking at the end of his night, the unborn . . . creates theUniverse anew. . . .\" (Vishnu Purana.)This is \"incidental\" pralaya; what is the Elemental Dissolution? \"When by dearth and fire,\" says Parasara to Maitreya, \"all the worldsand Patalas (hells) are withered up . . .*** the progress of elemental dissolution is begun. Then, first the waters swallow up the propertyof Earth (which is the rudiment of smell), and earth deprived of this property proceeds to destruction -- and becomes one with water . .. . when the Universe is thus pervaded by the waves of the watery Element, its rudimentary flavour is locked up by the elements of fire. . . on account of which the waters themselves are destroyed . . . and become one with fire; and the Universe is therefore, entirelyfilled with flame (ethereal) which gradually overspreads the whole world. While Space is one flame, the element of wind seizes uponthe rudimental property or form, which is the cause of light, and that being withdrawn (pralina) all becomes of the nature of air. Therudiment of form being destroyed, and Vibhavasu (fire?) deprived of its rudiment, air extinguishes fire and spreads over space, whichis deprived of light when fire merges into air. Air, then, accompanied by sound, which is the source of Ether, extends everywherethroughout the ten regions . . . . until Ether seizes upon cohesion (Sparsa -- Touch?) its rudimental property, by the loss of which, air isdestroyed, and KHA remains unmodified; devoid of form, flavour, touch (Sparsa), and smell, it exists, embodied (murttimat) and vast,and pervades the whole Space. Akasa, whose characteristic property and rudiment is sound (the \"Word\"), occupies the wholecontainment of Space. Then the origin (Noumenon?) of the Elements (Bhutadi), devours sound (collective Demiurgos); and the hostsof Dhyan Chohans, and all the existing[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The chief Kumara or Virgin-god (a Dhyan Chohan) who refuses to create.

The primary Element, Consciousness, combined with tamasa (spiritual darkness) isitself disintegrated by MAHAT (the Universal Intellect), whose characteristic property is Buddhi, and earth and Mahat are the inner andouter boundaries of the Universe.\" Thus as (in the beginning) \"were the seven forms of Prakriti (nature) reckoned from Mahat to earth,so these seven successively re-enter into each other.\"**\"The Egg of Brahma (Sarva-mandala) is dissolved in the waters that surround it, with its seven zones (dwipas) seven oceans, sevenregions, and their mountains; the investure of water is drunk by the fire; the (stratum of) fire is absorbed by (that of) air; air blends itselfwith ether (Akasa); the Bhutadi (the origin, or rather the cause, of the primary element) devours the ether and is (itself) destroyed byMahat (the Great, the Universal mind), which along with all these is seized upon by Prakriti and disappears. The Prakriti is essentiallythe same, whether discrete or indiscrete; only that which is discrete is finally absorbed by and lost in the indiscrete.

The Creative Force is Eternal asNoumenon; as a phenomenal manifestation in its aspects, it has a beginning and must, therefore, have an end. During that interval ithas its periods of activity and its periods of rest. And these are the \"Days and the nights of Brahma.\" But Brahma, the Noumenon,never rests, as IT never changes and ever IS, though IT cannot be said to be anywhere. . . . .The Jewish Kabalists felt this necessity of immutability in an eternal, infinite Deity, and therefore applied the same thought to theanthropomorphic god. The idea is poetical and very appropriate in its application. In the Zohar we read as follows:--\"As Moses was keeping a vigil on Mount Sinai, in company with the deity, who was concealed from his sight by a cloud, he felt agreat fear overcome him, and suddenly asked: 'Lord, where art thou . . . . sleepest thou, O Lord? . . .' And the Spirit answered him: 'Inever sleep: were I to fall asleep for a moment BEFORE MY TIME, all the creation would crumble into dissolution in one instant.' \"\"Before my time\" is very suggestive. It shows the God of Moses to be only a temporary substitute, like Brahma the male, a substituteand an aspect of THAT which is immutable, and which therefore can take no part in the \"days,\" or in the \"nights,\" nor have anyconcern whatever with reaction or dissolution.While the Eastern Occultists have seven modes of interpretation, the Jews have only four -- namely, the real-mystical; the allegorical;the moral; and the literal or Pashut. The latter is the key of the exoteric Churches and not worth discussion. Read in the first, ormystical key, here are several sentences which show the identity of the foundations of construction in every Scripture. It is given in Mr.T. Myer's excellent book on the Kabalistic works he seems to have well studied. I quote verbatim. \"B'raisheeth barah elohim ath hashama yem v'ath haa'retz -- i.e., 'In the beginning the God(s) created the heavens and the earth;\" (the meaning of which is:) the sixSephiroth of Construction,* over which B'raisheeth stands, all belong Below. It created six (and) on these stand all Things. And thosedepend upon the seven forms of the Cranium up to the Dignity of all Dignities.

These six[[diagram]] whose essence is of the Seventh -- are the Upadhi, the base or fundamental stone on which the objective Universe is built,the noumenoi of all things. Hence they are, at the same time, the Forces of nature, the Seven Angels of the Presence, the sixth andseventh principles in man; the spirito-psycho-physical spheres of the Septenary chain, the Root Races, etc., etc. They all \"dependupon the Seven forms of the Cranium\" up to the highest.

This process isrepeated after every Pralaya before the beginnings of a new Manvantara, or period of sentient individual being. \"Thirteen depend onthirteen forms,\" refers to the thirteen periods personified by the thirteen Manus, with Swayambhuva the fourteenth (13, instead of 14,being an additional veil): those fourteen Manus who reign within the term of a Mahayuga, a \"Day\" of Brahma. These (thirteen-fourteen) of the objective Universe depend on the thirteen (fourteen) paradigmatic, ideal forms. The meaning of the \"Six thousandyears\" which \"hang in the first six words,\" has again to be sought in the Indian Wisdom.

They are the Kings who are \"the Seven Rishis, certain (secondary)divinities, Sakra (Indra), Manu, and the Kings his Sons, who are created and perish at one period,\" as said in Vishnu Purana (Book I.chap. iii.). For the seventh (\"thousand\") (not the millennium of exoteric Christianity, but that of Anthropogenesis) represents both the\"seventh period of creation,\" that of physical man (Vishnu Purana), and the seventh Principle -- both macrocosmic and microcosmic, --as also the pralaya after the Seventh period, the \"Night\" which has the same duration as the \"Day\" of Brahma. \"It was renderedentirely desolate during twelve hours, as is written.\" It is in the Thirteenth (twice six and the Synthesis) that everything shall be restored\"and the six will continue.\"Thus the author of the Qabbalah remarks quite truly that \"Long before his (Ibn Gebirol's) time . . . many centuries before the Christianera, there was in Central Asia a 'Wisdom Religion;' fragments of which subsequently existed among the learned men of the archaicEgyptians, the ancient Chinese, Hindus, etc. . . .\" and that . . . . . \"The Qabbalah most likely originally came from Aryan sources,through Central Asia, Persia, India and Mesopotamia, for from Ur and Haran came Abraham and many others into Palestine\" (p. 221).And such was the firm conviction of C.

Anyhow, it is curious to see how prophetic in almost allthings was the writer of Vishnu Purana when foretelling to Maitreya some of the dark influences and sins of this Kali Yug. For aftersaying that the \"barbarians\" will be masters of the banks of the Indus, of Chandrabhaga and Kasmera, he adds:\"There will be contemporary monarchs, reigning over the earth -- kings of churlish spirit, violent temper, and ever addicted tofalsehood and wickedness.

In the same chapter, cclxxii, it is stated that theMoryas will one day reign over India, after restoring the Kshattriya race many thousand years hence. Only that reign will be purelySpiritual and \"not of this world.\" It will be the kingdom of the next Avatar. Colonel Tod believes the name Morya (or Maureyas) acorruption of Mori, a Rajpoot tribe, and the commentary on Mahavansa thinks that some princes have taken their name Maurya fromtheir town called Mori, or, as Professor Max Muller gives it, Morya-Nagara, which is more correct, after the original Mahavansa.Vachaspattya, we are informed by our Brother, Devan Badhadur R.

Such is the LOTUS. It is the flower sacred to nature and her Gods, and represents the abstract and theConcrete Universes, standing as the emblem of the productive powers of both spiritual and physical nature. It was held sacred from theremotest antiquity by the Aryan Hindus, the Egyptians, and the Buddhists after them; revered in China and Japan, and adopted as aChristian emblem by the Greek and Latin Churches, who made of it a messenger as the Christians do now, who replace it with thewater lily.* It had, and still has, its mystic meaning which is identical with every nation on the earth. We refer the reader to Sir WilliamJones.** With the Hindus, the lotus is the emblem of the productive power of nature, through the agency of fire and water (spirit andmatter). \"Eternal!\" says a verse in the Bhagavad Gita, \"I see Brahm the creator enthroned in thee above the lotus!\"; and Sir W. Jonesshows, as noted in the Stanzas, that the seeds of the lotus contain, even before they germinate, perfectly-formed leaves, the miniatureshapes of what one day, as perfected plants, they will become. The lotus, in India, is the symbol of prolific earth, and what is more, ofMount Meru. The four angels or genii of the four quarters of Heaven (the Maharajahs, see Stanzas) stand each on a lotus. The lotus isthe two-fold type of the Divine and human hermaphrodite, being of dual sex, so to say."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The spirit of Fire (or Heat), which stirs up, fructifies, and develops into concrete form everything (from its ideal prototype), which is bornof WATER or primordial Earth, evolved Brahma -- with the Hindus.

Thus also, Osiris and Horus were represented by the Egyptians constantly in association with the lotus-flower, the two beingSun-gods or Fire (the Holy Ghost being still typified by \"tongues of fire\"), (Acts).** See Sir William Jones' \"Dissertations Relating to Asia.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 380 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.female aspect of Vishnu,* and who is also called Padma, the lotus, is likewise shown floating at \"Creation,\" on a lotus flower, andduring the \"churning of the ocean\" of space, springing from the \"sea of milk,\" like Venus from the froth. \". . . Then seated on a lotusBeauty's bright goddess, peerless Sri, aroseOut of the waves . . . \"sings an English Orientalist and poet (Sir Monier Williams).The underlying idea in this symbol is very beautiful, and it shows, furthermore, its identical parentage in all the religious systems.Whether in the lotus or water-lily shape it signifies one and the same philosophical idea -- namely, the emanation of the objectivefrom the subjective, divine Ideation passing from the abstract into the concrete or visible form. For, as soon as DARKNESS -- or ratherthat which is \"darkness\" for ignorance -- has disappeared in its own realm of eternal Light, leaving behind itself only its divinemanifested Ideation, the creative Logoi have their understanding opened, and they see in the ideal world (hitherto concealed in thedivine thought) the archetypal forms of all, and proceed to copy and build or fashion upon these models forms evanescent andtranscendent.At this stage of action, the Demiurge** is not yet the Architect. Born in the twilight of action, he has yet to first perceive the plan, torealise the ideal forms which lie buried in the bosom of Eternal Ideation, as the future lotus-leaves, the immaculate petals, areconcealed within the seed of that plant. . . . .In chapter lxxxi. of the Ritual (Book of the Dead), called \"Transformation into the Lotus,\" a head emerging from this flower, the godexclaims: \"I am the pure lotus, emerging from the Luminous one. . . . . I carry the messages of Horus. I am the pure lotus which comesfrom the Solar Fields. . . . .\"The lotus-idea may be traced even in the Elohistic chapter, the 1st of Genesis, as stated in Isis.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Lakshmi is Venus -- Aphrodite, and, like the latter, she sprang from the froth of the ocean with a lotus in her hand. In the Ramayanashe is called Padma.** In Esoteric philosophy the Demiurge or Logos, regarded as the CREATOR, is simply an abstract term, an idea, like \"army.\" As thelatter is the all-embracing term for a body of active forces or working units -- soldiers -- so is the Demiurge the qualitative compound ofa multitude of Creators or Builders. Burnouf, the great Orientalist, has seized the idea perfectly when saying that Brahma does notcreate the earth, any more than the rest of the universe. \"Having evolved himself from the soul of the world, once separated from thefirst cause, he evaporates with, and emanates all nature out of himself. He does not stand above it, but is mixed up with it; Brahmaand the universe form one Being, each particle of which is in its essence Brahma himself, who proceeded out of himself.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 381 THE EXOTERIC AND THE ESOTERIC.It is in this idea that we must look for the origin and explanation of the verse in the Jewish cosmogony, which reads: \"And God said,Let the earth bring forth . . . . the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself.\" In all the primitive religions, the \"Son ofthe Father\" is the creative God -- i.e., His thought made visible; and before the Christian era, from the Trimurti of the Hindus down tothe three kabalistic heads of the scriptures as explained by the Jews, the triune godhead of each nation was fully defined andsubstantiated in its allegories.Such is the cosmic and ideal significance of this great symbol with the Eastern peoples. But, applied to practical and exoteric worship-- which had also its esoteric symbology -- the lotus became in time the carrier and container of a more terrestrial idea. No dogmatic"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"religion has ever escaped the sexual element in it; and to this day it soils the moral beauty of the root idea. The following is quotedfrom the same Kabalistic MSS. already mentioned:--\"Pointing to like signification was the lotus growing in the waters of the Nile. Its mode of growth peculiarly fitted it as a symbol of thegenerative activities. The flower of the lotus, which is the bearer of the seed for reproduction, as the result of its maturing, isconnected by its placenta-like attachment with mother-earth, or the womb of Isis, through the water of the womb, that is, the river Nile,by means of the long cord-like stalk, the umbilicus. Nothing can be plainer than the symbol, and to make it perfect in its intendedsignification, a child is sometimes represented as seated in or issuing from the flower.* Thus Osiris and Isis, the children of Chronos, ortime without end, in the development of their nature-forces, in this picture become the parents of man under the name Horus. . .\"(See § X., \"Deus Lunus.\")\"We cannot lay too great stress upon the use of this generative function as a basis for a symbolical language and a scientific art-speech. Thought upon the idea leads at once to reflection upon the subject of creative cause. In its workings Nature is observed tohave fashioned a wonderful piece of living mechanism governed by an added living soul; the life development and history of whichsoul, as to its whence, its present, and its whither, surpasses all efforts of the human intellect.** The new born is an ever-recurringmiracle, an evidence that[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In Indian Puranas it is Vishnu, the first, and Brahma, the second logos, or the ideal and practical creators, who are respectivelyrepresented, one as manifesting the lotus, the other as issuing from it.** Not the \"efforts\" of the trained psychic faculties of an Initiate into Eastern metaphysics, and the mysteries of creative Nature. It is theprofane of the past ages who have degraded the pure ideal of cosmic creation into an emblem of mere human reproduction andsexual functions: it is the esoteric teachings, and the initiates of the Future, whose mission it is, and will be, to redeem and ennobleonce more the primitive conception so sadly profaned by its crude and gross application to exoteric dogmas and personations bytheological and ecclesiastical religionists. The silent worship of abstract or noumenal Nature, the only divine manifestation, is the oneennobling religion of Humanity.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 382 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.within the workshop of the womb an intelligent creative power has intervened to fasten a living soul to a physical machine. Theamazing wonderfulness of the fact attaches a holy sacredness to all connected with the organs of reproduction, as the dwelling andplace of evident constructive intervention of deity.\"This is a correct rendering of the underlying ideas of old, of the purely pantheistic conceptions, impersonal and reverential, of thearchaic philosophers of the prehistoric ages. Not so, however, when applied to sinful humanity, to the gross ideas attached topersonality. Therefore, no pantheistic philosopher would fail to find the remarks that follow the above and which represent theanthropomorphism of Judean symbology, other than dangerous for the sacredness of true religion, and fitting only our materialisticage, which is the direct outcome and result of that anthropomorphic character. For this is the key-note to the entire spirit and essenceof the Old Testament. \"Therefore,\" goes on the MSS., treating of the symbolism of art-speech of the Bible:--\"The locality of the womb is to be taken as the MOST HOLY PLACE, the SANCTUM SANCTORUM, and the veritable TEMPLE OFTHE LIVING GOD.* With man the possession of the woman has always been considered as an essential part of himself, to make oneout of two, and jealously guarded as sacred. Even the part of the ordinary house or home consecrated to the dwelling of the wife wascalled the penetralia, the secret or sacred, and hence the metaphor of the Holy of Holies of sacred constructions taken from the ideaof the sacredness of the organs of generation. Carried to the extreme of description** by metaphor, this part of the house is describedin the Sacred Books as the \"between the thighs of the house,\" and sometimes the idea is carried out constructively in the great door-opening of Churches placed inward between flanking buttresses.\"No such thought \"carried to the extreme\" ever existed among the old primitive Aryans. This is proven by the fact that in the Vedicperiod their women were not placed apart from men in penetralia, or \"Zenanas.\" Their seclusion began when the Mahomedans -- thenext heirs to Hebrew symbolism after Christian ecclesiasticism -- had conquered the land and gradually enforced their ways andcustoms upon the Hindus. The pre- and post-Vedic woman was as free as man; and no impure terrestrial thought was ever mixed withthe religious symbo-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Surely the words of the old Initiate into the primitive mysteries of Christianity, \"Know ye not ye are the Temple of God\" (I Corinth. iii.16) could not be applied in this sense to men? The meaning may have been, and was so, undeniably, in the minds of the Hebrewcompilers of the Old Testament. And here is the abyss that lies between the symbolism of the New Testament and the Jewish canon.This gulf would have remained and ever widened, had not Christianity -- especially and most glaringly the Latin Church -- thrown abridge over it? Modern Popery has now spanned it entirely, by its dogma of the two immaculate conceptions, and theanthropomorphic and at the same time idolatrous character it has conferred upon the Mother of its God.** It was so carried only in the Hebrew Bible, and its servile copyist, Christian theology."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 383 THE PURITY OF EARLY PHALLICISM.logy of the early Aryans. The idea and application are purely Semitic. This is corroborated by the writer of the said intensely learnedand Kabalistic revelation himself, when he closes the above-quoted passages by adding:--\"If to these organs as symbols of creative cosmic agencies the idea of the origin of measures as well as of time-periods can beattached, then indeed, in the constructions of the Temples as Dwellings of Deity, or of Jehovah, that part designated as the Holy ofHolies, or the Most Holy place, should borrow its title from the recognised sacredness of the generative organs, considered as symbolsof measures as well as of creative cause. With the ancient WISE, there was no name and no idea, and no symbol of A FIRSTCAUSE.\" . . . .Most decidedly not. Rather never give a thought to it and leave it for ever nameless, as the early Pantheists did, than degrade thesacredness of that Ideal of Ideals, by dragging down its symbols into such anthropomorphic forms! Here again one perceives theimmense chasm between Aryan and Semitic religious thought: two opposite poles -- Sincerity and Concealment. With the Brahmins,who have never invested with an \"original Sin\" element the natural procreative functions of mankind, it is a religious duty to have ason. A Brahmin, in days of old, having accomplished his mission of human creator, retired to the jungle and passed the rest of hisdays in religious meditations. He had accomplished his duty to nature as mortal man and its co-worker, and henceforth gave all histhoughts to the spiritual immortal portion in himself, regarding the terrestrial as a mere illusion, an evanescent dream -- which it is.With the Semite, it was different. He invented a temptation of flesh in a garden of Eden; showed his God (esoterically, the Tempterand the Ruler of Nature) CURSING for ever an act, which was in the logical programme of that nature.* All this exoterically, as in thecloak and dead letter of Genesis and the rest; and at the same time esoterically he regarded the supposed sin and FALL as an act sosacred, as to choose the organ, the perpetrator of the original sin, as the fittest and most sacred symbol to represent that God, who isshown as branding its entering into function as disobedience and everlasting SIN!Who can ever fathom the paradoxical depths of the Semitic mind? And this paradoxical element, minus its innermost significance,has now passed entirely into Christian theology and dogma!Whether the early Fathers of the Church knew the esoteric meaning of the Hebrew (Old) Testament, or whether only a few of themwere aware of it, while the others remained ignorant of the secret, is for[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The same idea is carried out exoterically in the incidents of Egypt. The Lord God tempts sorely Pharaoh and \"plagues him withgreat plagues,\" lest the king should escape punishment, and thus afford no pretext for one more triumph to his \"Chosen people.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 384 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.posterity to decide. One thing is certain, at any rate. As the esotericism of the New Testament agrees perfectly with that of the HebrewMosaic Books; and since, at the same time, a number of purely Egyptian symbols and pagan dogmas in general -- the Trinity forexample -- have been copied by, and incorporated into, the Synoptics and St. John, it becomes evident that the identity of thosesymbols was known to the writers of the New Testament, whoever they were. They must have been aware also of the priority of theEgyptian esotericism, since they have adopted several such symbols that typify purely Egyptian conceptions and beliefs -- in theiroutward and inward meaning -- and which are not to be found in the Jewish Canon. One of such is the water-lily in the hands of theArchangel in the early representations of his appearance to the Virgin Mary; and these symbolical images are preserved to this day inthe iconography of the Greek and Roman Churches. Thus water, fire, the Cross, as well as the Dove, the Lamb, and other sacredanimals, with all their combinations, yield esoterically an identical meaning, and must have been accepted as an improvement uponJudaism pure and simple.For the Lotus and Water are among the oldest symbols, and in their origin are purely Aryan, though they became common propertyduring the branching-off of the fifth race. Let us give an example. Letters, as much as numbers, were all mystic, whether incombination or each taken separately. The most sacred of all is the letter M. It is both feminine and masculine, or androgyne, and ismade to symbolize WATER, the great deep, in its origin. It is mystic in all the languages, Eastern and Western, and stands as a glyphfor the waves, thus: [[diagram]]. In the Aryan Esotericism, as in the Semitic, this letter has always stood for the waters; e.g., in SanskritMAKARA -- the tenth sign of the Zodiac -- means a crocodile, or rather an aquatic monster associated always with water. The letterMA is equivalent to and corresponds with number 5 -- composed of a binary, the symbol of the two sexes separated, and of theternary, symbol of the third life, the progeny of the binary. This, again, is often symbolised by a Pentagon, the latter being a sacredsign, a divine Monogram. MAITREYA is the secret name of the Fifth Buddha, and the Kalki Avatar of the Brahmins -- the lastMESSIAH who will come at the culmination of the Great Cycle. It is also the initial letter of the Greek Metis or Divine Wisdom; ofMimra, the \"word\" or Logos; and of Mithras (the Mihr), the Monad, Mystery. All these are born in, and from, the great Deep, and arethe Sons of Maya -- the Mother; in Egypt, Mouth, in Greece Minerva (divine wisdom), Mary, or Miriam, Myrrha, etc.; of the Mother ofthe Christian Logos, and of Maya, the mother of Buddha. Madhava and Madhavi are the titles of the most important gods andgoddesses of the Hindu Pantheon. Finally, Mandala is in------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 385 THE EGYPTIAN LOTUS."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Sanskrit \"a circle,\" or an orb (the ten divisions of the Rig Veda). The most sacred names in India begin with this letter generally -- fromMahat, the first manifested intellect, and Mandara, the great mountain used by the gods to churn the Ocean, down to Mandakin, theheavenly Ganga (Ganges), Manu, etc., etc.Shall this be called a coincidence? A strange one it is then, indeed, when we find even Moses -- found in the water of the Nile --having the symbolical consonant in his name. And Pharaoh's daughter \"called his name Moses . . . because,\" she said, \"I drew himout of WATER\" (Exod. ii., 10.)* Besides which the Hebrew sacred name of God applied to this letter M is Meborach, the \"Holy\" or the\"Blessed,\" and the name for the water of the Flood is M'bul. A reminder of the \"three Maries\" at the Crucifixion and their connectionwith Mar, the Sea, or Water, may close this example. This is why in Judaism and Christianity the Messiah is always connected withWater, Baptism, the Fishes (the sign of the Zodiac called Meenam in Sanskrit), and even with the Matsya (fish) Avatar, and the Lotus --the symbol of the womb, or the water-lily, which is the same.In the relics of ancient Egypt, the greater the antiquity of the votive symbols and emblems of the objects exhumed, the oftener are thelotus flowers and the water found in connection with the Solar Gods. The god Khnoom -- the moist power -- water, as Thales taught it,being the principle of all things, sits on a throne enshrined in a lotus (Saitic epoch, Serapeum). The god Bes stands on a lotus, readyto devour his progeny. (Ibid, Abydos.) Thot, the god of mystery and Wisdom, the sacred Scribe of Amenti, wearing the Solar disc ashead gear, sits with a bull's head (the sacred bull of Mendes being a form of Thot) and a human body, on a full blown lotus. (IVthDynasty.) Finally it is the goddess Hiquet, under her shape of a frog, who rests on the lotus, thus showing her connection with water.And it is this frog-symbol, undeniably the most ancient of their Egyptian deities, from whose unpoetical shape the Egyptologists havebeen vainly trying to unravel her mystery and functions. Its adoption in the Church by the early Christians shows that they knew itbetter than our modern Orientalists. The \"frog or toad goddess\" was one of the chief cosmic deities connected with creation, onaccount of her amphibious nature, and chiefly because of her apparent resurrection, after long ages of solitary life enshrined in oldwalls, in rocks, etc. She not only participated in the organization of the world, together with Khnoom, but was also connected with the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Even to the seven daughters of the Midian priest, who, coming to draw the water, had Moses water their flock, for which service theMidian gives to Moses Zipporah (sippara = the shining wave) as wife (Exod. ii.)

The ancient Greeks brought it intoprominence, and the modern poets have worn it threadbare. The Queen of Night, riding in the majesty of her peerless light inheaven, throwing all, even Hesperos, into darkness, and spreading her silver mantle over the whole sidereal world, has ever been afavourite theme with all the poets of Christendom, from Milton and Shakespeare down to the latest versifier. But the refulgent lamp ofnight, with her suite of stars unnumbered, spoke only to the imagination of the profane. Until lately, Religion and Science had noughtto do with the beautiful mythos. Yet, the cold chaste moon, she, in the words of Shelley --. . . . \"Who makes all beautiful on which she smilesThat wandering shrine of soft, yet icy flame,Which ever is transformed, yet still the same,And warms, but not illumines.\" . . . .stands in closer relations to Earth than any other sidereal orb. The Sun is the giver of life to the whole planetary system; the Moon isthe giver of life to our globe; and the early races understood and knew it, even in their infancy. She is the Queen and she is the King,and was King Soma before she became transformed into Phoebe and the chaste Diana. She is pre-eminently the deity of theChristians, through the Mosaic and Kabalistic Jews, though the civilized world may have remained ignorant of the fact for long ages;in fact, ever since the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* With the Egyptians it was the resurrection in rebirth after 3,000 years of purification, either in Devachan or \"the fields of bliss.\"** Such \"frog-goddesses\" may be seen at Bulaq, in the Cairo Museum.

For the \"Fathers\" -- such asOrigen or Clemens Alexandrinus -- the Moon was Jehovah's living symbol: the giver of Life and the giver of Death, the disposer ofbeing -- in our World. For, if Artemis was Luna in Heaven, and, with the Greeks, Diana on Earth, who presided over child-birth and life:with the Egyptians, she was Hekat (Hecate) in Hell, the goddess of Death, who ruled over magic and enchantments. More than this: asthe personified moon, whose phenomena are triadic, Diana-Hecate-Luna is the three in one. For she is Diva triformis, tergemina,triceps -- three heads on one neck,* like Brahma-Vishnu-Siva. Hence she is the prototype of our Trinity, which has not always beenentirely male. The number seven, so prominent in the Bible, so sacred in its seventh (Sabbath) day, came to the Jews from Antiquity,deriving its origin from the four-fold number 7 contained in the 28 days of the lunar month, each septenary portion thereof beingtypified by one quarter of the moon.It is worth the trouble of presenting in this work a bird's-eye view of the origin and development of the lunar myth and worship inhistorical antiquity, on our side of the globe. Its earlier origin is untraceable by exact science, rejecting as it does tradition; while forTheology, which, under the guidance of the crafty Popes, has put a brand on every fragment of literature that does not bear theimprimatur of the Church of Rome, its archaic history is a sealed book. Whether the Egyptian or the Aryan Hindu religious philosophyis the more ancient -- and the Secret Doctrine says it is the latter -- does not much matter in this instance, as the lunar and solar\"worship\" are the most ancient in the world. Both have survived, and prevail to this day throughout the whole world, with some openly,with others -- e.g., in Christian symbolics -- secretly. The cat, a lunar symbol, was sacred to Isis, herself the Moon in one sense, as Osiriswas the Sun. The cat is often seen on the top of the Sistrum in the hand of the goddess. This animal was held in great veneration inthe city of Bubaste, which went into deep mourning after the death of every sacred cat, because Isis, as the Moon, was particularlyworshipped in this city of mysteries. The astronomical symbolism connected with it has already been given in Section I. of\"Symbolism,\" and no one has better described it than Mr. G. Massey, in his Lectures and in \"The Natural Genesis.\" The eye of the cat,it is said, seems to follow the lunar phases in its growth and decline, and its orbs shine like two stars in the darkness of night. Hence themythological allegory which shows Diana hiding under the shape of a cat in the Moon, when, in company with other deities, she wasseeking to[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The goddess [[Trimorphos]] in the statuary of Alcamenes.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 388 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.escape the pursuit of Typhon (Vide the Metamorphoses of Ovid). The moon in Egypt was both the \"Eye of Horus\" and the \"Eye ofOsiris,\" the Sun.The same with the Cynocephalus. The dog-headed ape was a glyph to symbolise the sun and moon, in turn, though theCynocephalus is more a Hermetic than a religious symbol. For it is the hieroglyph of Mercury, the planet, as of the Mercury of theAlchemical philosophers, \"as,\" say the Alchemists, \"Mercury has to be ever near Isis, as her minister, as without Mercury neither Isis norOsiris can accomplish anything in the GREAT WORK.\" Cynocephalus, whenever represented with the Caduceus, the Crescent, or theLotus, is a glyph of the \"philosophical\" Mercury; but when seen with a reed, or a roll of parchment, he stands for Hermes, the secretaryand adviser of Isis, as Hanuman filled the same office with Rama.Though the regular Sun-Worshippers, the Parsis, are few, yet not only is the bulk of the Hindu mythology and history based upon andinterblended with these two worships, but so is also the Christian religion itself. From their origin down to our modern day it hascoloured the theologies of both the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches. The difference, indeed, between the Aryan Hindu andthe Aryan European faiths is very small, if only the fundamental ideas of both are taken into consideration. Hindus are proud ofcalling themselves Suryas and Chandravansas (of the Solar and Lunar dynasties). The Christians pretend to regard it as idolatry, andyet they adhere to a religion entirely based upon the solar and lunar worships. It is useless and vain for the Protestants to exclaimagainst the Roman Catholics for their \"Mariolatry,\" based on the ancient cult of lunar goddesses, when they themselves worshipJehovah, pre-eminently a lunar god, and when both Churches have accepted in their theologies the \"Sun\"-Christ and the lunar trinity.What is known of Chaldaean Moon-Worship, of the Babylonian god, Sin, called by the Greeks \"Deus Lunus,\" is very little, and thatlittle is apt to mislead the profane student who fails to grasp the esoteric significance of the symbols. As popularly known to theancient profane philosophers and writers (for those who were initiated were pledged to silence) the Chaldaea were the worshippers ofthe moon under her (and his) various names, just as were the Jews, who came after them.In the unpublished MSS. on the Art Speech, already mentioned, giving a key to the formation of the ancient (symbolical) languagesa logical raison d'etre is brought forward for this double worship. It is written by a wonderfully well-informed and acute scholar andMystic, who gives it in the comprehensive form of a hypothesis.

It would also be discovered that there was a longest and shortest solar day, and two solar days ofequal day and night, within the period of the solar year; and the points in the year of these could be marked with the greatestprecision in the starry groups of the heavens or the constellations, subject to that retrograde movement thereof, which in time wouldrequire a correction by intercalation, as was the case in the description of the Flood, where correction of 150 days was made for aperiod of 600 years, during which confusion of landmarks had increased. . . . This would naturally come to pass . . . . with all races inall time; and such knowledge must be taken to have been inherent in the human race, prior to what we call the historic period. . . . .\"On this basis, the author seeks for some natural physical function possessed in common by the human race, and connected with theperiodical manifestations, such that \"the connection between the two kinds of phenomena . . . became fixed in popular usage.\" Hefinds it \"(a) in the feminine physiological phenomena every lunar month of 28 days, or\" 4 weeks of 7 days each, so that 13occurrences of the period should happen in 364 days, which is the solar week year of 52 weeks of 7 days each.

It was the mode with the Hebrews, for even to-day they calculate thecalendar by means of the 354 and 355 of the lunar year, and we possess a special evidence that it was the mode with the ancientEgyptians, as to which this is the proof:--[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Ancient Mythology includes ancient Astronomy as well as Astrology. The planets were the hands pointing out, on the dial of oursolar system, the hours of certain periodical events. Thus, Mercury was the messenger appointed to keep time during the daily solarand lunar phenomena, and was otherwise connected with the God and Goddess of Light.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 390 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"The basic idea underlying the religious philosophy of the Hebrews was that God contained all things within himself*; and that manwas his image, man including woman . . . The place of the man and woman with the Hebrews was among the Egyptians occupied bythe bull and the cow, sacred to Osiris and Isis,** who were represented, respectively, by a man having a bull's head, and a womanhaving the head of a cow, which symbols were worshipped. Notoriously Osiris was the Sun and the river Nile, the tropical year of 365days, which number is the value of the word Neilos, and the bull, as he was also the principle of fire and of life-giving force, while Isiswas the Moon, the bed of the river Nile, or the Mother Earth, for the parturient energies of which water was a necessity, the lunar yearof 354-364 days, the time-maker of the periods of gestation, and the cow marked by, or with, the crescent new moon.\" . . . .\"But the use of the cow of the Egyptians for the women of the Hebrews was not intended as of any radical difference of signification,but a concurrence in the teaching intended, and merely as a substitution of a symbol of common import, which was this, viz., theperiod of parturition with the cow and the woman was held to be the same, or 280 days, or ten lunar months of four weeks each. Andin this period consisted the essential value of this animal symbol, whose mark was that of the crescent moon.*** . . . These parturientand natural periods are found to have been subjects of symbolism all over the world. They were thus used by the Hindus, and arefound to be most plainly set forth by the ancient Americans, in the Richardson and Gest tablets, in the Palenque Cross; and manifestlylay at the base of the formation of the calendar forms of the Mayas of Yucatan, the Hindus, the Assyrians, and the ancientBabylonians, as well as the Egyptians and old Hebrews. The natural symbols . . . would be either the phallus or the phallus and yoni, .. . or male and female. Indeed, the words translated by the generalizing terms male and female, in the 27th verse of the 1st chapterof Genesis are . . . sacr and n'cabrah, or literally, phallus and yoni,**** while the representation of the phallic emblems would barelyindicate the genital members of the human body, when their functions and the development of the seed-vesicles emanating fromthem was considered; then would come into indication a mode of measures of lunar time, and, through lunar, of solar time.\" . . .This is the physiological or anthropological key to the Moon symbol. The key that opens the mystery of theogony, or the evolution ofthe Manvantaric gods, is more complicated, and has nothing phallic in it. All is mystical and divine there. But the Jews, beyondconnecting Jehovah directly with the Moon as a generative god, preferred to ignore the higher hierarchies, and have made of someof them (zodiacal constellations and planetary gods) their Patriarchs, thus euhemerizing the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* A caricatured and dwarfed Vedantin notion of Parabrahmam containing within itself the whole Universe as being that boundlessUniverse itself, and there existing nothing outside of itself.** Just as they are to this day in India, the bull of Siva and the cow representing several Sakti -- goddesses."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"*** Hence the worship of the moon by the Hebrews.**** \"Male and female, created he them.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 391 THE TIME PERIODS.purely theosophical idea and dragging it down to the level of sinful humanity. (See section \"Holy of Holies\" in the \"Symbolism\" ofBook II.) The MSS. from which the above is extracted explains very clearly to what hierarchy of gods Jehovah belonged, and who thisJewish GOD was; for it shows in clear language that which the writer has always insisted upon -- namely, that the God with which theChristians have burdened themselves was no better than the lunar symbol of the reproductive or generative faculty in nature. Theyhave ever ignored even the Hebrew secret god of the Kabalists, Ain-Soph, as grand as Parabrahmam in the earliest Kabalistic andmystical conceptions. But it is not the Kabala of Rosenroth that can ever give the true original teachings of Simeon-Ben-Iochai, asmetaphysical and philosophical as any. And how many are there among the students of the Kabala who knew anything of themexcept in their distorted Latin translations. Let us glance at the idea which led the ancient Jews to adopt a substitute for the everUNKNOWABLE, and which has misled the Christians into mistaking the substitute for the reality.\"If to these organs (phallus and yoni) as symbols of creative cosmic agencies the idea of . . . . time periods can be attached, then,indeed, in the construction of Temples as Dwellings of Deity, or of Jehovah, that post designated as the Holy of Holies, or the mostHigh Place, should borrow its title from the recognized sacredness of the generative organs, considered as symbols of measures aswell as of creative Cause.\"\"With the ancient wise, there was no name, and no idea, and no symbol, of a First Cause.* With the Hebrews, the indirect conceptionof such was couched in a term of negation of comprehension -- viz., Ain-Soph, or the Without Bounds. But the symbol of its firstcomprehensible manifestation, was the conception of a circle with its diameter line. . . . . (See the Proem of Book I., Part I.) to carry atonce a geometric, phallic, and astronomic idea . . . . for the one takes its birth from the nought or the Circle, without which it could notbe, and from one, or primal one, spring the nine digits, and, geometrically, all plane shapes. So in the Kabala this Circle, with itsdiameter line, is the picture of the ten Sephiroth or Emanations, composing the Adam Kadmon, the Archetypal Man, the creativeorigin of all things. . . . . This idea of connecting the circle and its diameter line, that is, number ten, with the signification of thereproductive organs, and the Most Holy Place, was carried out constructively in the King's Chamber, or Holy of Holies, of the greatPyramid, in the Tabernacle of Moses, and in the Holy of Holies of the Temple of Solomon. . . . . It is the picture of a double-womb,for in Hebrew the letter he [[diagram]] is at the same time the number 5 and symbol of the womb, and twice 5 is 10, or the phallicnumber.\"This \"double womb\" also shows the duality of the idea carried from[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Because it was too sacred. It is referred to as THAT in the Vedas: it is the \"Eternal Cause,\" and cannot, therefore, be spoken of as a\"First Cause,\" a term implying the absence of any cause, at one time.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 392 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the highest, spiritual, down to the lowest or terrestrial plane; and by the Jews limited to the latter. With them, therefore the number 7has acquired the most prominent place in their exoteric religion, a cult of external forms and empty rituals; as their Sabbath, forinstance, the seventh day sacred to their deity, the moon, symbolical of the generative Jehovah. While with other nations the numberseven was typical of theogonic evolution, of cycles, cosmic planes, and the Seven Forces and Occult Powers in Kosmos, as aboundless whole, whose first upper triangle was unreachable to the finite intellect of man -- while other nations, therefore, busiedthemselves, in their forcible limitation of Kosmos in Space and Time, only with its septenary manifested plane, the Jews centred thismember solely in the moon, and based all their sacred calculations thereupon. Hence we find the thoughtful author of the MSS. justquoted, remarking, in reference to the metrology of the Jews that: \"If 20,612 be multiplied by 4/3 the product will afford a base for theascertainment of the mean revolution of the moon, and if this product be again multiplied by 4/3, this continued product will afford abase for finding the exact period of the mean solar year, . . . this form . . . becoming, for the finding of astronomical periods of time, ofvery great service.\" This double number (male and female) is symbolized also in some well-known idols: e.g., \"Ardanari-Iswara, the Isisof the Hindus, Eridanus, or Ardan, or the Hebrew Jordan, or source of descent. She is standing on a lotus-leaf flowing on the water.But the signification is, that it is androgyne or hermaphrodite, that is phallus and yoni combined, the number 10, the Hebrew letterJod [[diagram]], the containment of Jehovah. She, or rather she-he, gives the minutes of the same circle of 360 degrees.\"\"Jehovah,\" in its best aspect is Binah, \"the Upper mediating Mother, the Great Sea or Holy Spirit;\" therefore rather a synonym of Mary,the Mother of Jesus, than of his Father; that \"Mother, being the Latin Mare\" the Sea is here also, Venus, the Stella del Mare, or \"Starof the Sea.\"The ancestors of the mysterious Akkadians -- the Chandra or Indovansas, the Lunar Kings whom tradition shows reigning at Prayag(Allahabad) ages before our era -- had come from India, and brought with them the worship of their forefathers, of Soma, and his sonBudha, which afterwards became that of the Chaldeans. Yet such adoration, apart from popular Astrolatry and Heliolatry, was in nosense idolatry. No more, at any rate, than the modern Roman Catholic symbolism which connects their Virgin Mary -- the MagnaMater of the Syrians and Greeks -- with the Moon."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Of this worship, the most pious Roman Catholics feel quite proud,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 393 COPIES AND ORIGINALS.and loudly confess to it. In a Memoire to the French Academy, the Marquis De Mirville says:--\"It is only natural that, as an unconscious prophecy, Ammon-Ra should be his mother's husband, since the Magna Mater of theChristians is precisely the spouse of that son she conceives. . . . We (Christians) can understand now why Neithis throws radiance on thesun, while remaining the Moon, since the VIRGIN, who is the QUEEN OF HEAVEN, as Neith was, clothes herself in her radiance, andclothes in his turn the CHRIST-SUN. \"Tu vestis solem et te sol vestit.\". . . is sung by the Roman Catholics during their service, and headds:--\"We (Christians) understand also how it is that the famous inscription at Sais should have stated that 'none has ever lifted my peplum(veil),' considering that this sentence, literally translated, is the summary of what is sung in the Church on the day of the immaculateconception.\" (ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE VIRGIN MOTHER,\" p. 117.)Surely nothing could be more sincere than this! It justifies entirely what Mr. Gerald Massey has said in his Lecture on \"Luniolatry,Ancient and Modern\":--\"The man in the moon (Osiris-Sut, Jehovah-Satan, Christ-Judas, and other Lunar twins) is often charged with bad conduct. . . . In thelunar phenomena the moon was one as the moon, which was two-fold in sex, and three-fold in character -- as mother, child, and adultmale. Thus the child of the moon became the consort of his own mother! It could not be helped if there was to be any reproduction.He was compelled to be his own father! These relationships were repudiated by later sociology, and the primitive man in the moongot tabooed. Yet, in its latest, most inexplicable phase, this has become the central doctrine of the grossest superstition the world hasseen, for these lunar phenomena and their humanly represented relationships, the incestuous included, are the very foundations ofthe Christian Trinity in Unity. Through ignorance of the symbolism, the simple representation of early time has become the mostprofound religious mystery in modern Luniolatry. The Roman Church, without being in any wise ashamed of the proof, portrays theVirgin Mary arrayed with the sun, and the horned moon at her feet, holding the lunar infant in her arms -- as child and consort of themother moon. The mother, child, and adult male, are fundamental.\"\"In this way it can be proved that our Christology is mummified mythology, and legendary lore, which have been palmed off upon usin the Old Testament and the New, as divine revelation uttered by the very voice of God.\"A charming allegory is found in the Zohar, one which unveils better than anything ever did the true character of Jehovah or YHVH inthe primitive conception of the Hebrew Kabalists. It is now found in the philosophy of I'bn Gebirol's Kabbalah, translated by IsaacMyer. \"In the introduction written by R'Hez'quee-yah, which is very old,\" says our author, \"and forms part of our Brody edition of theZohar (I, 5b. sq.) is an account of a journey taken by R. El'azar, son of R. Shim-on b. Io'hai, and Rabbi Abbah.\" They met a man witha heavy burden and asked his name; but he refused to give it and proceeded to explain to them Thorah------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 394 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(Law). \"They asked: 'Who caused thee thus to walk and carry such a heavy load?' He answered: 'The letter [[diagram]], (Yod, which =10, and is the symbolical letter of Kether and the essence and germ of the Holy name [[diagram]] YHVH) . . . . They said to him: 'Ifthou wilt tell us the name of thy father, we will kiss the dust of thy feet.' He replied: 'As to my father, he had his dwelling in the GreatSea, and was a fish therein' (like Vishnu and Dagon or Oannes), 'which (first) destroyed the great sea' . . . . . and he was great andmighty and 'Ancient of Days,' until he swallowed all the other fishes in the (Great) Sea . . . R. El'azar listened and said to him: 'Thouart the Son of the Holy Flame, thou art the Son of Rab Ham -- 'nun-ah Sabah [the old: the fish in Aramaic or Chaldee is nun (noon)]thou art the Son of the Light of the Thorah,\" (Dharma) etc. Then the author explains that the feminine Sephiroth, Binah, is termed bythe Kabalist the great sea: therefore Binah, whose divine names are Jehovah, Yah, and Elohim, is simply the Chaldean Tiamat, thefemale power, the Thalatth of Berosus, who presides over the Chaos, and was made out later by Christian theology to be the serpentand the Devil. She-He (Yah-hovah) is the supernal (Heh, and Eve). This Yah-hovah then or Jehovah, is identical with our Chaos --Father, Mother, Son, -- on the material plane and in the purely physical World. Demon and Deus at one and the same time; the sunand moon, good and evil, God and Demon.Lunar magnetism generates life, preserves and destroys it, psychically as well as physically. And if, astronomically, she is one of theseven planets of the ancient world, in theogony she is one of the regents thereof; with Christians now as much as with Pagans, theformer referring to her under the name of one of their archangels, and the latter under that of one of their gods.Therefore the meaning of the \"fairy tale\" translated by Chwolson from an old Chaldean MSS. translated into Arabic, about Qu-tamybeing instructed by the idol of the moon, is easily understood (vide Book III.) Seldenus tells us the secret as well as Maimonides (MoreNevochim, Book III., ch. xxx). The worshippers of the Teraphim (the Jewish Oracles) \"carved images and claimed that the light of theprincipal stars (planets) permeating these through and through, the angelic VIRTUES (or the regents of the stars and planets)conversed with them, teaching them many most useful things and arts.\" And Seldenus explains that the Teraphim were built andcomposed after the position of certain planets, those which the Greeks called [[stoicheia]], and according to figures that were located"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"in the sky and called [[alexeteroi]], or the tutelary gods.

It is not a fairy tale;and as far as regards pious Churchmen, the same worship may be shown in the Scriptures, however disfigured by translation. Solarand Lunar worship, as well as that of the Stars and Elements, are traced, and figure in the Christian theology; defended by Papists,they are stoutly denied by the Protestants only at their own risk and peril. Two instances may be given.Ammianus Marcellinus teaches that ancient divinations were always accomplished with the help of the Spirits of the Elements,\"Spiritus elementorum, and in Greek [[pneumata ton stoicheion]]\" (1. I., 21).But it is found now that the planets, the Elements, and the Zodiac, were figured not only in Heliopolis by the twelve stones called\"mysteries of the elements,\" elementorum arcana, but also in Solomon's temple, and, as pointed out by various writers, in several oldItalian churches and even at Notre Dame de Paris where they can be seen to this day.No symbol -- the sun included -- was more complex in its manifold meanings than the lunar symbol. The sex was, of course, dual. Withsome it was male, e.g., the Hindu \"King Soma,\" and the Chaldean Sin; with other nations it was female, the beauteous goddessesDiana-Luna, I'lythia, Lucina. In Tauris, human victims were sacrificed to Artemis, a form of the lunar goddess; the Cretans called herDictynna, and the Medes and Persians Anaitis, as shown by an inscription of Koloe: '[[Artemidi 'Anaeiti]]. But, we are now concernedchiefly with the most chaste and pure of the virgin goddesses, Luna-Artemis, to whom Pamphos was the first to give the surname of[[Kalliste]], and of whom Hippolitus wrote: [[Kallista polu parthenon]]. (See Pausanias viii., 35, 8.) This Artemis-Lochia, the goddessthat presided at conception and child-birth (Iliad, Pausanias, etc., etc.), is, in her functions and as the triple Hecate, the Orphic deity,the predecessor of the God of the Rabbins and pre-Christian Kabalists, and his lunar type. The goddess [[Trimorphos]] was thepersonified symbol of the various and successive aspects represented by the moon in each of her three phases; and this interpretationwas already that of the Stoics (Cornut. De Nat, D. 34, 1), while the Orpheans explained the epithet ([[Trimorphos]]) by the threekingdoms of nature over which she reigned. jealous, blood-thirsty, revengeful and exacting, Hecate-Luna is a worthy counterpart of the\"Jealous God\" of the Hebrew prophets.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 396 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The whole riddle of the solar and lunar worship, as now traced in the churches, hangs indeed on this world-old mystery of lunarphenomena. The correlative forces in the \"Queen of Night,\" that lie latent for modern science, but are fully active to the knowledge ofEastern adepts, explain well the thousand and one images under which the moon was represented by the ancients. It also shows howmuch more profoundly learned in the Selenic mysteries were the ancients than are now our modern astronomers. The wholePantheon of the lunar gods and goddesses, Nephtys or Neith, Proserpina, Melytta, Cybele, Isis, Astarte, Venus, and Hecate, on theone hand, and Apollo, Dionysius, Adonis, Bacchus, Osiris, Atys, Thammuz, etc., etc., on the other, all show on the face of their namesand titles -- those of \"Sons\" and \"Husbands\" of their mothers -- their identity with the Christian Trinity. In every religious system thegods were made to merge their functions as Father, Son, and Husband, into one, and the goddesses were identified as \"Wife, Mother,and Sister\" of the male God; the former synthesizing the human attributes as the \"Sun, the giver of Life,\" the latter merging all theother titles in the grand synthesis known as Maia, Maya, Maria, etc., a generic name. Maia, in its forced derivation, has come to meanwith the Greeks, \"mother,\" from the root ma (nurse), and even gave its name to the month of May, which was sacred to all thosegoddesses before it became consecrated to Mary.* Its primitive meaning, however, was Maya, Durga, translated by the Orientalists as\"inaccessible,\" but meaning in truth the \"unreachable,\" in the sense of illusion and unreality; as being the source and cause of spells,the personification of ILLUSION.In religious rites the moon served a dual purpose. Personified as a female goddess for exoteric purposes, or as a male god in allegoryand symbol, in occult philosophy our satellite was regarded as a sexless Potency to be well studied, because it was to be dreaded.With the initiated Aryans, Khaldii, Greeks and Romans, Soma, Sin, Artemis Soteira (the hermaphrodite Apollo, whose attribute is thelyre, and the bearded Diana of the bow and arrow), Deus Lunus, and especially Osiris-lunus and Thot-lunus,** were the occultpotencies of the moon. But whether male or female, whether Thot or Minerva, Soma or Astoreth, the Moon is the Occult mystery ofmysteries, and more a symbol of evil than of good. Her seven phases (original, esoteric division) are divided into three astronomicalphenomena and four[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Roman Catholics are indebted for the idea of consecrating the month of May to the Virgin, to the pagan Plutarch, who showsthat \"May is sacred to Maia ([[Maia]]) or Vesta\" (Aulus-Gellius, word Maia) -- our mother-earth, our nurse and nourisher personified.** Thot-Lunus is \"Budha-Soma\" of India, or \"Mercury and the Moon.\""},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 397 THE MOON, BISEXUAL.purely psychic phases. That the moon was not always reverenced is shown in the Mysteries, in which the death of the moon-god (thethree phases of gradual waning and final disappearance) was allegorized by the moon standing for the genius of evil that triumphs forthe time over the light and life-giving god (the sun), and all the skill and learning of the ancient Hierophants in Magic was required toturn this triumph into a defeat.It was the most ancient worship of all, that of the third Race of our Round, the Hermaphrodites, to whom the male-moon becamesacred, when after the \"Fall\" so-called, the sexes had become separated. \"Deus Lunus\" then became an androgyne, male and femalein turn; to serve finally, for purposes of sorcery, as a dual power, to the Fourth Root-race, the Atlanteans. With the Fifth (our own) thelunar-solar worship divided the nations into two distinct, antagonistic camps. It led to events described aeons later in theMahabharatan War, which to the Europeans is the fabulous, to the Hindus and Occultists the historical, strife between the Suryavansasand the Indovansas. Originating in the dual aspect of the moon, the worship of the female and the male principles respectively, itended in distinct solar and lunar cults. Among the Semitic races, the sun was for a very long time feminine and the moon masculine --the latter notion being adopted by them from the Atlantean traditions. The moon was called \"the Lord of the sun,\" Bel-Skemesh,*before the Shemesh worship. The ignorance of the incipient reasons for such a distinction, and of occult principles, led the nationsinto anthropomorphic idol-worship. But the religion of every ancient nation had been primarily based upon the Occult manifestationsof a purely abstract Force or Principle now called \"God.\" The very establishment of such worship shows, in its details and rites, that thephilosophers who evolved those systems of nature, subjective and objective, possessed profound knowledge, and were acquaintedwith many facts[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* During that period which is absent from the Mosaic books -- from the exile of Eden to the allegorical Flood -- the Jews worshippedwith the rest of the Semites Dayanisi [[hebrew]] \"the Ruler of Men,\" the \"Judge,\" or the SUN. Though the Jewish canon andChristianism have made the sun become the \"Lord God\" and Jehovah in the Bible, yet the latter is full of indiscreet traces of theandrogyne Deity, which was Jehovah the sun, and Astoreth the moon in its female aspect, and quite free from the presentmetaphorical element given to it. God is a \"consuming fire,\" appears in, and is encompassed by fire.\" It was not only in vision thatEzekiel (viii., 16) saw the Jews \"worshipping the sun.\" The Baal of the Israelites (the Shemesh of the Moabites and the Moloch of theAmmonites) was the identical \"Sun-Jehovah,\" and he is till now \"the King of the Host of Heaven,\" the Sun, as much as Astoreth wasthe \"Queen of Heaven\" -- or the moon. The \"Sun of Righteousness\" has become a metaphorical expression only now.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 398 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of a scientific nature. For besides being purely Occult, the rites of lunar worship were based, as just shown, upon a knowledge ofphysiology (quite a modern science with us), psychology, sacred mathematics, geometry and metrology, in their right applications tosymbols and figures, which are but glyphs, recording observed natural and scientific facts; in short, upon a most minute and profoundknowledge of nature. Lunar magnetism generates life, preserves and kills it. Soma embodies the triple power of the Trimurti, though itpasses unrecognized by the profane to this day. The allegory that makes Soma, the moon, produced by the churning of the Ocean ofLife (Space) by the gods in another Manvantara (i.e., in the pregenetic day of our planetary system), and that other allegory, whichshows \"the Rishis milking the earth, whose calf was Soma, the moon,\" has a deep cosmographical meaning; for it is neither our earthwhich is milked, nor was the moon, which we know, the calf.* Had our wise men of science known as much of the mysteries of natureas the ancient Aryans did, they would surely never have imagined that the moon was projected from the Earth. Once more, the oldestof permutations in theogony, the Son becoming his own father and the mother generated by the Son, has to be remembered andtaken into consideration if the symbolical language of the ancients is to be understood by us. Otherwise mythology will be everhaunting the Orientalists as simply \"the disease which springs up at a peculiar stage of human culture!\" -- as Renouf gravely observesin a Hibbert lecture.The ancients taught the, so to speak, auto-generation of the Gods: the one divine essence, unmanifested, perpetually begetting asecond-self, manifested, which second-self, androgynous in its nature, gives birth in an immaculate way to everything macro- andmicro-cosmical in this universe. This was shown in the Circle and the Diameter, or the Sacred 10, a few pages back.But our Orientalists, their extreme desire to discover one homogeneous element in nature notwithstanding, will not see it; cramped intheir researches by such ignorance, they -- the Aryanists and Egyptologists -- are constantly led astray from truth in their speculations.Thus, de Rouge is unable to understand, in the text which he translates, the meaning of Ammon-Ra saying to King Amenophes(supposed to be Memnon), \"Thou art my Son, I have begotten thee\"; and as he[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The earth flees for her life in the allegory, before Prithu, who pursues her. She assumes the shape of a cow, and, trembling withterror, runs away and hides even in the regions of Brahma. Therefore, it is not our Earth. Again, in every Purana, the calf changesname. In one it is Manu Swayambhuva, in another Indra, in a third the Himavat (Himalayas) itself, while Meru was the milker. This isa deeper allegory than one thinks.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 399 THE DIGNITY OF SAIS."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"finds the same idea in many a text and under various forms, this very Christian Orientalist is finally compelled to exclaim that \"for thisidea to have entered the mind of a hierogrammatist, there must have been in their religion a more or less defined doctrine, indicatingas a possible fact that might come to pass, a divine and immaculate incarnation under a human form.\" Precisely. But why throw theexplanation on an impossible prophecy, when the whole secret is explained by the later religion copying the earlier?That doctrine was universal, and it was not the mind of any one hierogrammatist that evolved it; for the Indian avatars are a proof tothe contrary. After which, having come \"to realize clearer\"* what \"the Divine Father and Son\" were with the Egyptians, de Rouge stillfails to account for, and perceive what were the functions attributed to the feminine principle in that primordial generation. He doesnot find it in the goddess Neith, of Sais. Yet he quotes the sentence of the Commander to Cambyses when introducing that king intothe Saitic temple: \"I made known to his Majesty the dignity of Sais, which is the abode of Neith, the great (female) producer, genitrixof the Sun, who is the first-born, and who is not begotten, but only brought forth,\" and hence is the fruit of an immaculate mother.How much more grandiose, philosophical and poetical is the real distinction -- for whoever is able to understand and appreciate it --made between the immaculate virgin of the ancient Pagans and the modern Papal conception. With the former, the ever-youthfulmother nature, the antitype of her prototypes, the sun and moon, generates and brings forth her \"mind-born\" son, the Universe. TheSun and Moon, as male-female deities, fructify the earth, the microcosmical mother, and the latter conceives and brings forth, in herturn. With the Christians, \"the first-born\" (primogenitus) is indeed generated, i.e., begotten, \"genitum, non factum,\" and positivelyconceived and brought forth -- \"Virgo pariet,\" explains the Latin Church. Thus, she drags down the noble spiritual ideal of the VirginMary to the earth, and, making her \"of the earth earthy,\" degrades that ideal to the lowest of the anthropomorphic goddesses of therabble.Truly, Neith, Isis, Diana, etc., etc., were each of them \"a demiurgical goddess, at once visible and invisible, having her place inHeaven, and helping to the generation of species\" -- the moon, in short. Her occult aspects and powers are numberless, and, in one ofthem, the moon becomes with[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* His clear realization of it is, that the Egyptians prophesied Jehovah (!) and his incarnated Redeemer (the good serpent), etc., etc.;even to identifying Typhon with the wicked dragon of the garden of Eden, and this passes as serious and sober science.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 400 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Egyptians Hathor, another aspect of Isis,* and both of these goddesses are shown suckling Horus. Behold in the Egyptian Hall ofthe British Museum, Hathor worshipped by Pharaoh Thotmes, who stands between her and the Lord of Heavens. The monolith wastaken from Karnac; and the same goddess has the following legend inscribed on her throne: \"THE DIVINE MOTHER AND LADY, ORQUEEN OF HEAVEN\"; also \"the MORNING STAR,\" and the \"LIGHT OF THE SEA\" (Stella matutina and Lux maris). All the lunargoddesses had a dual aspect -- one divine, the other infernal. All were the virgin mothers of an immaculately born Son -- the SUN.Raoul Rochetti shows the moon-goddess of the Athenians -- Pallas, or Cybele, Minerva, or again Diana -- holding her child-son on thelap, invoked in her festivals as [[Monogenes Theou]], \"the one Mother of God,\" sitting on a lion, and surrounded by twelvepersonages; in whom the Occultist recognises the twelve great gods, and the pious Christian Orientalist the apostles, or rather theGrecian pagan prophecy thereof.They are both right, for the immaculate goddess of the Latin Church is a faithful copy of the older pagan goddesses; the number(twelve) of the apostles is that of the twelve tribes, and the latter are a personification of the twelve great gods, and of the twelve signsof the Zodiac. Every detail almost in the Christian dogma is borrowed from the heathens. Semele, the wife of Jupiter and mother ofBacchus, the Sun, is, according to Nonnus, also \"carried,\" or made to ascend to heaven after her death, where she presides betweenMars and Venus, under the name of the Queen of the World, or the universe, [[panbasileia]]; \"at the names of which, as at the namesof Hathor, Hecate, and other infernal goddesses,\" \"tremble all the demons.\"**\"[[Semelen premousi daimones]].\" This Greek inscription on a small temple, reproduced on a stone that was found by somebody, andcopied by Montfaucon, as De Mirville tells us (113, Archaeologie de la Vierge mere) informs us of the stupendous fact, that theMagna Mater of the old world was an impudent plagiarism, perpetrated by the Demon, of the Immaculate Virgin Mother of hisChurch. Whether so, or vice versa, is of no importance. That which is interesting to note is the perfect identity between the ARCHAICCOPY and the MODERN ORIGINAL.Did space permit we might show the inconceivable coolness and unconcern exhibited by certain followers of the Roman CatholicChurch, when made to face the revelations of the Past. To Maury's remark that \"the Virgin took possession of all the Sanctuaries ofCeres and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Hathor is the infernal Isis, the goddess pre-eminently of the West or the nether world.** This is De Mirville, who proudly confesses the similarity, and he ought to know.------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 1, Page]] 401 ANTE-HISTORICAL CATHOLICISM.Venus, and that the pagan rites, proclaimed and practised in honour of those goddesses, were in a good measure transferred to themother of Christ,\" the advocate of Rome answers:--\"That such is the fact, and that it is just as it should be and quite natural. As the dogma, the liturgy, and the rites professed by theRoman Apostolical Church in 1862 are found engraved on monuments, inscribed on papyri, and cylinders hardly posterior to theDeluge, it does seem impossible to deny the existence of a FIRST ANTE-HISTORICAL (Roman) CATHOLICISM OF WHICH OUR OWNIS BUT THE FAITHFUL CONTINUATION. . . . But while the former was the culmination, the summum of the impudence of demonsand Goetic necromancy . . . . the latter is divine. If in our (Christian) Revelation (l'Apocalypse), Mary, clothed with the Sun and havingthe moon under her feet, has nothing more in common with the humble servant of Nazareth (sic.), it is because she has now becomethe greatest of theological and cosmological powers in our universe.\" -- (Archaeol. de la Vierge, pp. 116 and 119, and by the Marquisde Mirville).Verily so, since Pindar's Hymns to Minerva (p. 19) . . . \"who sits at the right hand of her Father Jupiter, and who is more powerful thanall the other (angels or) gods,\" are likewise applied to the Virgin. It is St. Bernard, who, quoted by Cornelius a Lapide, is made toaddress the Virgin Mary in this wise:--\"The Sun-Christ lives in thee and thou livest in him.\" (Sermon on the Holy Virgin.) . . . .Again the Virgin is admitted to be the MOON by the same unsophisticated holy man. Being the Lucina of the Church, that is inchildbirth, the verse of Virgil -- \"Casta fove Lucina, tuus jam regnat Apollo\" -- is applied to her. Like the moon, the Virgin is the Queenof Heaven,\" adds the innocent saint; (Apocal., ch. xii., Comm. by Cornelius a Lapide).This settles the question. The more similarity, according to such writers as De Mirville, there exists between the pagan conceptionsand the Christian dogmas, the more divine appears the Christian religion, and the more is it seen to be the only truly inspired one,especially in its Roman Catholic form. The unbelieving scientists and the academicians who think they see in the Latin Church quitethe opposite of divine inspiration, and who will not believe in the satanic tricks of plagiarism by anticipation, are severely taken totask. But then \"they believe in nothing and reject even the 'Nabathean Agriculture' as a romance and a pack of superstitiousnonsense,\" complains the memorialist. \"In their perverted opinion Qu-ta-my's 'idol of the moon' and the statue of the Madonna areone!\" A noble Marquis wrote twenty years ago six huge volumes, or, as he calls them \"Memoires to the French Academy,\" with thesole object of showing Roman Catholicism an inspired and revealed faith. As a proof thereof, he furnishes numberless facts, alltending to show that the entire ancient world, ever since------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 402 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the deluge, had been, with the help of the devil, systematically plagiarizing the rites, ceremonies, and dogmas of the future HolyChurch to be born ages later. What would that faithful son of Rome have said had he heard his co-religionist -- M. Renouf, thedistinguished Egyptologist of the British Museum -- declaring, in one of his learned lectures, that \"neither Hebrews nor Greeksborrowed any of their ideas from Egypt?\"*But perhaps it is just this that M. Renouf intended to say namely -- that it is the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Aryans, who borrowedtheirs from the Latin Church? And if so, why, in the name of logic, do the Papists reject the additional information which the Occultistsmay give them on Moon-worship, since it all tends to show their (the Roman Catholic) worship as old as the world -- OF SABAEANISMAND ASTROLATRY?The reason of early Christian and later Roman Catholic astrolatry, or the symbolical worship of Sun and Moon -- identical with that ofthe Gnostics, though less philosophical and pure than the \"Sun worship\" of the Zoroastrians -- is a natural consequence of its birth andorigin. The adoption by the Latin Church of such symbols as the water, fire, sun, moon and stars, and a good many other things, issimply a continuation by the early Christians of the old worship of Pagan nations. Thus Odin got his wisdom, power, and knowledge,by sitting at the feet of Mimir, the thrice-wise Jotun, who passed his life by the fountain of primeval Wisdom, the crystalline waters ofwhich increased his knowledge daily. Mimir \"drew the highest knowledge from the fountain, because the world was born of water;hence primeval wisdom was to be found in that mysterious element\" (\"Asgard and the Gods,\" 86). The eye which Odin had to pledgeto acquire that knowledge may be \"the Sun, which enlightens and penetrates all things; his other eye being the moon, whosereflection gazes out of the deep, and which at last, when setting, sinks into the Ocean.\" (Ibid.) But it is something more, besides this.Loki, the fire-god, is said to have hidden in the water, as well as in the moon, the light-giver, whose reflection he found therein; andthis belief that the fire finds refuge in the water was not limited to the old Scandinavians. It was shared by all nations and was finallytaken up by the early Christians, who symbolized the Holy Ghost under the shape of Fire, \"cloven tongues like as fire\" -- the breath ofthe Father-SUN. This \"Fire\" descends also into the Water or the Sea: Mar, Mary. The dove was the symbol of the Soul with severalnations, it was sacred to Venus, the goddess born from the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Quoted in Mr. G. Massey's Lecture.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 403 IDENTITY OF TYPOLOGY."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"sea-foam, and it became later the symbol of the Christian Anima Mundi, or the Holy Spirit.One of the most occult chapters in the \"Book of the Dead\" is ch. lxxx., entitled: \"To make the transformation into the god giving lightto the path of Darkness,\" wherein \"Woman-light of the Shadow\" serves Thot in his retreat in the moon. Thot-Hermes is said to hidetherein, because he is the representative of the Secret Wisdom. He is the manifested logos of its light side, the concealed deity or\"Dark Wisdom\" when he is supposed to retire to the opposite hemisphere. Speaking of her power, the moon calls herself repeatedly:\"The Light which shineth in Darkness,\" the \"Woman-Light.\" Hence it became the accepted symbol of all the Virgin-Mother goddesses.As the wicked \"evil\" spirits warred against the moon in days of yore, so they are supposed to war now, without being able to prevail,however, against the actual Queen of Heaven, Mary, the moon. Hence also the moon was intimately connected in all the Pagantheogonies with the Dragon, her eternal enemy; the Virgin, or Madonna, standing on the mythical Satan under that form, crushed andmade powerless, under her feet. This, because the head and tail of the Dragon, which represent in Eastern astronomy to this day theascending and descending nodes of the moon, were also symbolized in ancient Greece by the two serpents. Hercules kills them onthe day of his birth, and so does the babe in his virgin mother's arms. As Mr. Gerald Massey aptly observes in this connection: \"All suchsymbols figured their own facts from the first, and did not pre-figure others of a totally different order. The Iconography (and dogmas,too) had survived in Rome from a period remotely pre-Christian. There was neither forgery nor interpolation of types; nothing but acontinuity of imagery with a perversion of its meaning.\"--------------§ X.TREE, SERPENT, AND CROCODILE WORSHIP.\"Object of horror or of adoration, men have for the serpent an implacable hatred, or prostrate themselves before its genius.

For it taught Adam that if he ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, hewould raise his being immensely by the learning and wisdom he would thus acquire. Such was the exoteric reason given.It is easy to see whence the primal idea of this dual, Janus-like character of the Serpent: the good and the bad. This symbol is one ofthe most ancient, because the reptile preceded the bird, and the bird the mammal. Thence the belief, or rather the superstition, ofthe savage tribes who think that the souls of their ancestors live under this form, and the general association of the Serpent with thetree. The legends about the various things it represents are numberless; but, as most of them are allegorical, they have now passedinto the class of fables based on ignorance and dark superstition. For instance, when Philostratus narrates that the natives of India andArabia fed on the heart and liver of serpents in order to learn the language of all the animals, the serpent being credited with thatfaculty, he certainly never meant his words to be accepted literally. (See De Vita Apollonii, lib. 1, c. xiv.) As will be found more thanonce as we proceed, the \"Serpent\" and \"Dragon\" were the names given to the \"Wise Ones,\" the initiated adepts of olden times. It wastheir wisdom and their learning that were devoured or assimilated by their followers, whence the allegory. When the ScandinavianSigurd is fabled to have roasted the heart of Fafnir, the Dragon, whom he had slain, becoming thereby the wisest of men, it meant thesame thing. Sigurd had become learned in the runes and magical charms; he had received the \"word\" from an initiate of that name,or from a sorcerer, after which the latter died, as many do, after \"passing the word.\" Epiphanius lets out a secret of the Gnostics whiletrying to expose their heresies. The Gnostic Ophites, he says, had a reason for honouring the Serpent: it was because he taught theprimeval men the Mysteries (Adv. Haeres. 37). Verily so; but they did not have Adam and Eve in the garden in their minds whenteaching this dogma, but simply that which is stated above. The Nagas of the Hindu and Tibetan adepts were human Nagas(Serpents), not reptiles. Moreover, the Serpent has ever been the type of consecutive or serial rejuvenation, of IMMORTALITY andTIME.The numerous and extremely interesting readings, the interpretations and facts about Serpent worship, given in \"The NaturalGenesis,\" are very ingenious and scientifically correct. But they are far from covering the whole of the meanings implied. Theydivulge only the astronomical and physiological mysteries, with the addition of some cosmic phenomena. On the lowest plane ofmateriality the Serpent was, no doubt,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 405 THE DEGRADATION OF THE SYMBOL.\"the great mystery in the mysteries,\" and was, very likely, \"adopted as a type of feminine pubescence, on account of its sloughing andself-renewal.\" It was so, however, only with regard to mysteries concerning terrestrial animal life, for as symbol of \"reclothing andrebirth in the (universal) mysteries\" its \"final phase\"* -- or shall we rather say its incipient and culminating phases -- they were not of"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"this plane. They were generated in the pure realm of ideal light, and having accomplished the round of the whole cycle ofadaptations and symbolism, the \"mysteries\" returned from whence they had come -- into the essence of immaterial causality. Theybelonged to the highest gnosis. And surely this could have never obtained its name and fame solely on account of its penetration intophysiological and especially feminine functions!As a symbol, the Serpent had as many aspects and occult meanings as the Tree itself; the \"Tree of Life,\" with which it wasemblematically and almost indissolubly connected. Whether viewed as a metaphysical or a physical symbol, the Tree and Serpent,jointly, or separately, have never been so degraded by antiquity as they are now, in this our age of the breaking of idols, not for truth'ssake, but to glorify the more gross matter. The revelations and interpretations in \"The Rivers of Life\" would have astounded theworshippers of the Tree and Serpent in the days of archaic Chaldean and Egyptian wisdom; and even the early Saivas would haverecoiled in horror at the theories and suggestions of the author of the said work. \"The notion of Payne Knight and Inman that the crossor Tau is simply a copy of the male organs in a triadic form is radically false,\" writes Mr. G. Massey, who proves what he says. But thisis a statement that could be as justly applied to almost all the modern interpretations of ancient symbols. \"The Natural Genesis,\" amonumental work of research and thought, the most complete on that subject that has ever been published, covering as it does awider field, and explaining much more than all the symbologists who have hitherto written, does not yet go beyond the \"psycho-theistic\" stage of ancient thought. Nor were Payne Knight and Inman altogether wrong; except in entirely failing to see that theirinterpretations of the \"Tree of Life,\" as the cross and phallus, fitted the symbol, and approximated it, only on the lowest and last stageof the evolutionary development of the idea of the GIVER OF LIFE. It was the last and the grossest physical transformation of nature,in animal, insect, bird, and even plant; for biune, creative magnetism, in the form of the attraction of the contraries, or sexualpolarization, acts in the constitution of reptile and bird as it does in that of man. Moreover, the modern symbologists and Orientalists --from first to last --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Natural Genesis, by Gerald Massey, Vol. 1, p. 340.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 406 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.being ignorant of the real mysteries revealed by occultism, can necessarily see but this last stage. If told that this mode of procreation,which the whole world of being has now in common on this earth, is but a passing phase, a physical means of furnishing theconditions to, and producing the phenomena of life which will alter with this, and disappear with the next Root-Race -- they wouldlaugh at such a superstitious and unscientific idea. But the most learned Occultists assert this because they know it. The universe ofliving beings, of all those which procreate their species, is the living witness to the various modes of procreation in the evolution ofanimal and human species and races; and the naturalist ought to sense this truth intuitionally, even though he is yet unable todemonstrate it. And how could he, indeed, with the present modes of thought! The landmarks of the archaic history of the past are fewand scarce, and those that men of science come across are mistaken for finger-posts of our little era. Even so-called \"universal\" (?)history embraces but a tiny field in the almost boundless space of the unexplored regions of our latest, fifth Root-Race. Hence, everyfresh sign-post, every new glyph of the hoary Past that is discovered, is added to the old stock of information, to be interpreted on thesame lines of pre-existing conceptions, and without any reference to the special cycle of thought which that particular glyph maybelong to. How can Truth ever come to light if this method is never changed!Thus, in the beginning of their joint existence as a glyph of Immortal Being, the Tree and Serpent were divine imagery, truly. Thetree was reversed, and its roots were generated in Heaven and grew out of the Rootless Root of all-being. Its trunk grew anddeveloped, crossing the planes of Pleroma, it shot out crossways its luxuriant branches, first on the plane of hardly differentiatedmatter, and then downward till they touched the terrestrial plane. Thus, the Asvattha, tree of Life and Being, whose destruction aloneleads to immortality, is said in the Bhagavatgita to grow with its roots above and its branches below (ch. xv.). The roots represent theSupreme Being, or First Cause, the LOGOS; but one has to go beyond those roots to unite oneself with Krishna, who, says Arjuna(XI.), is \"greater than Brahman, and First Cause . . . the indestructible, that which is, that which is not, and what is beyond them.\" Itsboughs are Hiranyagharba (Brahma or Brahman in his highest manifestations, say Sridhara and Madhusudana), the highest DhyanChohans or Devas. The Vedas are its leaves. He only who goes beyond the roots shall never return, i.e., shall reincarnate no moreduring this \"age\" of Brahma.It is only when its pure boughs had touched the terrestrial mud of the garden of Eden, of our Adamic race, that this Tree got soiled bythe contact and lost its pristine purity; and that the Serpent of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 407 THE SEVEN-HEADED DRAGONS.Eternity -- the heaven-born LOGOS -- was finally degraded. In days of old -- of the divine Dynasties on Earth -- the now dreadedReptile was regarded as the first beam of light that radiated from the abyss of divine Mystery. Various were the forms which it wasmade to assume, and numerous the natural symbols adapted to it, as it crossed aeons of Time: as from Infinite Time itself -- Kala -- itfell into the space and time evolved out of human speculation. These forms were Cosmic and astronomical, theistic and pantheistic,abstract and concrete. They became in turn the Polar Dragon and the Southern Cross, the Alpha Draconis of the Pyramid, and theHindu-Buddhist Dragon, which ever threatens, yet never swallows the Sun during its eclipses. Till then, the Tree remained ever green,for it was sprinkled by the waters of life; the great Dragon, ever divine, so long as it was kept within the precincts of the sidereal fields.But the tree grew and its lower boughs touched at last the infernal regions -- our Earth. Then the great serpent Nidhogg -- he whodevours the corpses of the evil-doers in the \"Hall of Misery\" (human life), so soon as they are plunged into \"Hwergelmir,\" the roaring"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"cauldron (of human passions) -- gnawed the World-tree. The worms of materiality covered the once healthy and mighty roots, and arenow ascending higher and higher along the trunk; while the Midgard-snake coiled at the bottom of the Seas, encircles the Earth, and,through its venomous breath, makes her powerless to defend herself.They are all seven-headed, the dragons and serpents of antiquity -- \"one head for each race, and every head with seven hairs on it,\"as the allegory has it. Aye, from Ananta, the Serpent of Eternity which carries Vishnu through the Manvantara, from the originalprimordial Sesha, whose seven heads become \"one thousand heads\" in the Puranic fancy, down to the seven-headed AkkadianSerpent. This typifies the Seven principles throughout nature and man; the highest or middle head being the seventh. It is not of theMosaic, Jewish Sabbath that Philo speaks in his Creation of the World, when saying that the world was completed \"according to theperfect nature of number 6.\" For, \"when that reason (nous) which is holy in accordance with the number seven, has entered the soul(rather the living body), the number six is thus arrested, and all the mortal things which that number makes.\" And again: \"Number 7 isthe festival day of all the earth, the birthday of the world. I know not whether any one would be able to celebrate the number 7 inadequate terms.\" . . . (Par. pp. 30 and 419). The author of The Natural Genesis thinks that \"the Septenary of Stars seen in the greatbear (the Septarshis) and seven-headed Dragon furnished a visible origin for the symbolic seven of time above. The goddess of theseven stars,\" he adds --------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 408 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"Was the mother of time, as Kep; whence Kepti and Sebti for the two times and number seven. So this is the star of the Seven byname. Sevekt (Kronos), the Son of the goddess, has the name of the seven or seventh. So has Sefekh Abu who builds the house onhigh, as Wisdom (Sophia) built hers with seven pillars. . . The primary Kronotypes were seven, and thus the beginning of time inheaven is based on the number and the name of seven, on account of the starry demonstrators. The seven stars as they turned roundannually kept pointing, as it were, with the forefinger of the right hand, and describing a circle in the upper and lower heaven.* Thenumber seven naturally suggested a measure by seven, that led to what may be termed Sevening, and to the marking and mappingout of the circle in seven corresponding divisions which were assigned to the seven great constellations; and thus was formed thecelestial heptanomis of Egypt in the heavens. . . . When the stellar heptanomis was broken up and divided into four quarters, it wasmultiplied by four, and the twenty-eight signs took the place of the primary seven constellations, the lunar zodiac of twenty-eight daysbeing the registered result.** . . . In the Chinese arrangement the four sevens are given to four genii that preside over the four cardinalpoints. . . .\" (In Chinese Buddhism and Esotericism the genii are represented by four Dragons -- the \"Maharajahs\" of the Stanzas.)\"The seven Northern constellations make up the Black Warrior; the seven Eastern (Chinese autumn) constitute the White Tiger; theseven Southern are the Vermilion Bird; and the seven Western (called Vernal) are the Azure Dragon. Each of these four Spiritspresides over its heptanomis during one lunar week. The genetive of the first heptanomis (Typhon of the Seven Stars) now took alunar character; . . . in this phase we find the goddess Sefekh, whose name signifies number 7, is the feminine word, or logos in placeof the mother of Time, who was the earlier Word, as goddess of the Seven Stars\" (\"Typology of Time,\" Vol. II. p. 313, Nat. Gen.).The author shows that it was the goddess of the Great Bear and mother of Time who was in Egypt from the earliest times the \"LivingWord,\" and that \"Sevekh-Kronus, whose type was the Crocodile-Dragon, the pre-planetary form of Saturn, was called her son andconsort; he was her Word-Logos\" (p. 321, Vol. I.).The above is quite plain, but it was not the knowledge of astronomy only that led the ancients to the process of Sevening. The primalcause goes far deeper and will be explained in its place.The above quotations are no digressions. They are brought forward as showing (a) the reason why a full Initiate was called a\"Dragon,\" a \"Snake\" a \"Naga\"; and (b) that our septenary division was used by the priests of the earliest dynasties in Egypt, for thesame reason and on the same basis as by us. This needs further elucidation, however. As already stated, that which Mr. G.

Each lunar week has a distinct occult character in the lunar month; each day of the twenty-eight has itsspecial characteristics; as each of the twelve constellations, whether separately or in combination with other signs, has an occultinfluence either for good or for evil. This represents the sum of knowledge that men can acquire on this earth; yet few are those whoacquire it, and still fewer are the wise men who get to the root of knowledge symbolized by the great Root Dragon, the spiritualLOGOS of these visible signs.

The above is only for the Alchemists.The Serpent became the type and symbol of evil, and of the Devil, only during the middle ages. The early Christians -- besides theOphite Gnostics -- had their dual Logos: the Good and the Bad Serpent, the Agathodaemon and the Kakodaemon. This isdemonstrated by the writings of Marcus, Valentinus, and many others, and especially in Pistis Sophia -- certainly a document of theearliest centuries of Christianity. On the marble sarcophagus of a tomb, discovered in 1852 near the Porta Pia, one sees the scene ofthe adoration of the Magi, \"or else,\" remarks the late C. W.

In the smaller sarcophagi that surrounded the larger one, eleven leaden plates rolled likescrolls were found, three of which have been deciphered. The contents of these ought to be regarded as final proof of a much-vexedquestion, for they show that either the early Christians, up to the VIth Century, were bond fide pagans, or that dogmatic Christianitywas borrowed wholesale, and passed in full into the Christian Church -- Sun, Tree, Serpent, Crocodile and all.\"On the first is seen Anubis . . . holding out a scroll; at his feet are two female busts; below all are two serpents entwined . . . a corpseswathed up like a mummy.

As for the figure of the serpent, supposing these talismans to emanate not from the Isiac but the newer Ophite creed, it maywell stand for that \"True and perfect Serpent,\" who leads forth the souls of all that put their trust in him out of the Egypt of the body,and through the Red Sea of Death into the Land of Promise, saving them on their way from the Serpents of the Wilderness, that is,from the Rulers of the Stars.\" (King's \"Gnostics,\" p. 366.)And this \"True and Perfect Serpent\" is the seven-lettered God who is now credited with being Jehovah, and Jesus One with him. Tothis Seven-vowelled god the candidate for initiation is sent by Christos, in the Pistis Sophia, a work earlier than St. John's Revelation,and evidently of the same school. \"The (Serpent of the) Seven Thunders uttered------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 411 THE MYSTERY OF THE SEVEN THUNDERS.these seven vowels,\" but \"Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not,\" says Revelation. \"Do ye seekafter these mysteries?\" inquiries Jesus in Pistis Sophia. \"No mystery is more excellent than they (the seven vowels): for they shall bringyour souls unto the Light of Lights\" -- i.e., true Wisdom. \"Nothing, therefore, is more excellent than the mysteries which ye seek after,saving only the mystery of the Seven Vowels and their FORTY AND NINE Powers, and the numbers thereof.\"In India, it was the mystery of the Seven FIRES and their forty-nine fires or aspects, or \"the members thereof,\" just the same.These seven vowels are represented by the Swastika signs on the crowns of the seven heads of the Serpent of Eternity, in India,among esoteric Buddhists, in Egypt, in Chaldea, etc. etc., and among the Initiates of every other country. It is on the Seven zones ofpost mortem ascent, in the Hermetic writings, that the \"mortal\" leaves, on each, one of his \"Souls\" (or Principles); until arrived on theplane above all zones he remains as the great Formless Serpent of absolute wisdom -- or the Deity itself. The seven-headed serpenthas more than one signification in the Arcane teachings. It is the seven-headed Draco, each of whose heads is a star of the LesserBear; but it was also, and pre-eminently, the Serpent of Darkness (i.e., inconceivable and incomprehensible) whose seven heads werethe seven Logoi, the reflections of the one and first manifested Light -- the universal LOGOS.--------------"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"§ XI.DEMON EST DEUS INVERSUS.THIS symbolical sentence, in its many-sided forms, is certainly most dangerous and iconoclastic in the face of all the dualistic laterreligions -- or rather theologies -- and especially so in the light of Christianity.

As an \"adversary,\" the opposing Power required by the equilibrium andharmony of things in Nature -- like Shadow to throw off still brighter the Light, like Night to bring into greater relief the Day, and likecold to make one appreciate the more the comfort of heat -- SATAN has ever existed.

If \"God\" is Absolute, Infinite, and the Universal Root of all and everything in Nature and its universe, whencecomes Evil or D'Evil if not from the same \"Golden Womb\" of the absolute? Thus we are forced either to accept the emanation of goodand evil, of Agathodaemon and Kakodaemon as offshoots from the same trunk of the Tree of Being, or to resign ourselves to theabsurdity of believing in two eternal Absolutes!Having to trace the origin of the idea to the very beginnings of human mind, it is but just, meanwhile, to give his due even to theproverbial devil. Antiquity knew of no isolated, thoroughly and absolutely bad \"god of evil.\" Pagan thought represented good and evilas twin brothers, born from the same mother -- Nature; so soon as that thought ceased to be Archaic, Wisdom too became Philosophy.In the beginning the symbols of good and evil were mere abstractions, Light and Darkness; then their types became chosen amongthe most natural and ever-recurrent periodical Cosmic phenomena -- the Day and the Night, or the Sun and Moon. Then the Hosts ofthe Solar and Lunar deities were made to represent them, and the Dragon of Darkness was contrasted with the Dragon of Light (SeeStanzas V., VII. of Book I.) The Host of Satan is a Son of God, no less than the Host of the B'ni Alhim, these children of God comingto \"present themselves before the Lord,\" their father (see Job ii.). \"The Sons of God\" become the \"Fallen Angels\" only after perceivingthat the daughters of men were fair, (Genesis vi.) In the Indian philosophy, the Suras are among the earliest and the brightest gods,and become Asuras only when dethroned by Brahminical fancy. Satan never assumed an anthropomorphic, individualized shape,until the creation by man, of a \"one living personal god,\" had been accomplished; and then merely as a matter of prime necessity. Ascreen was needed; a scape-goat to explain the cruelty, blunders, and but too-evident injustice, perpetrated by him for whom absoluteperfection, mercy, and goodness were claimed. This was the first Karmic effect of abandoning a philosophical and logical Pantheism,to build, as a prop for lazy man, \"a merciful father in Heaven,\" whose daily and hourly actions as Natura naturans, the \"comely motherbut stone cold,\" belie the assumption. This led to the primal twins, Osiris-Typhon, Ormazd-Ahriman, and finally Cain-Abel and thetutti-quanti of contraries.Having commenced by being synonymous with Nature, \"God,\" the Creator, ended by being made its author. Pascal settles thedifficulty very cunningly: \"Nature has perfections, in order to show that she is the image of God: and defects, in order to show that sheis only his image,\" he says.The further back one recedes into the darkness of the prehistoric------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 413 DEATH IS LIFE.ages, the more philosophical does the prototypic figure of the later Satan appear. The first \"Adversary\" in individual human form thatone meets with in old Puranic literature is one of her greatest Rishis and Yogis -- Narada, surnamed the \"Strife-maker.\"And he is a Brahmaputra, a son of Brahma, the male. But of him later on. Who the great \"Deceiver\" really is, one can ascertain bysearching for him with open eyes and an unprejudiced mind, in every old cosmogony and Scripture.It is the anthropomorphised Demiurge, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, when separated from the collective Hosts of his fellow-Creators, whom, so to speak, he represents and synthesizes. It is now the God of theologies. \"The thought is father to the wish.\" Onceupon a time, a philosophical symbol left to perverse human fancy; afterwards fashioned into a fiendish, deceiving, cunning, andjealous God.Dragons and other fallen angels being described in other parts of this work, a few words upon the much-slandered Satan will besufficient. That which the student will do well to remember is that, with every people except the Christian nations, the Devil is to thisday no worse an entity than the opposite aspect in the dual nature of the so-called Creator. This is only natural. One cannot claimGod as the synthesis of the whole Universe, as Omnipresent and Omniscient and Infinite, and then divorce him from evil. As there isfar more evil than good in the world, it follows on logical grounds that either God must include evil, or stand as the direct cause of it,or else surrender his claims to absoluteness. The ancients understood this so well that their philosophers -- now followed by theKabalists -- defined evil as the lining of God or Good: Demon est Deus inversus, being a very old adage. Indeed, evil is but anantagonizing blind force in nature; it is reaction, opposition, and contrast, -- evil for some, good for others. There is no malum in se:only the shadow of light, without which light could have no existence, even in our perceptions. If evil disappeared, good woulddisappear along with it from Earth. The \"Old Dragon\" was pure spirit before he became matter, passive before he became active. Inthe Syro-Chaldean magic both Ophis and Ophiomorphos are joined in the Zodiac, at the sign of the Androgyne Virgo-Scorpio. Beforeits fall on earth the \"Serpent\" was Ophis-Christos, and after its fall it became Ophiomorphos-CHRESTOS. Everywhere the speculations"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"of the Kabalists treat of Evil as a FORCE, which is antagonistic, but at the same time essential, to Good, as giving it vitality andexistence, which it could never have otherwise.

Good is infinite and eternal only in theeternally concealed from us, and this is why we imagine it eternal. On the manifested planes, one equilibrates the other. Few arethose theists and believers in a personal God, who do not make of Satan the shadow of God; or who, confounding both, do notbelieve they have a right to pray to that idol asking its help and protection for the exercise and impunity of their evil and cruel deeds.\"Lead us not into Temptation\" is addressed daily to \"our Father, which art in Heaven,\" and not to the Devil, by millions of humanChristian hearts. They do so, repeating the very words put in the mouth of their Saviour, and do not give one thought to the fact thattheir meaning is contradicted point blank by James \"the brother of the Lord.\" \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted ofGod: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.\" -- (The Gen. Ep. of James, i, 13). Why, then, say that it isthe Devil who tempts us, when the Church teaches us on the authority of Christ that it is God who does so? Open any pious volume inwhich the word \"temptation\" is defined in its theological sense, and forthwith you find two definitions: (1) \"Those afflictions andtroubles whereby God tries his people;\" (2) Those means and enticements which the Devil makes use of to ensnare and alluremankind. (St. James i., 2, 12, and Mat. vi., 13.) If accepted literally, the two teachings of Christ and James contradict each other, andwhat dogma can reconcile the two if the occult meaning is rejected?Between the alternative allurements, wise will be that philosopher who will be able to decide where God disappears to make room forthe Devil! Therefore when we read that \"the Devil is a liar and the father of it,\" i.e., INCARNATE LIE, and are told in the same breaththat Satan -- the Devil -- was a son of God and the most beautiful of his archangels, rather than believe that Father and Son are agigantic, personified and eternal LIE, we prefer to turn to Pantheism and to Pagan philosophy for information.Once that the key to Genesis is in our hands, it is the scientific and symbolical Kabala which unveils the secret. The great Serpent ofthe Garden of Eden and the \"Lord God\" are identical, and so are Jehovah and Cain ONE -- that Cain who is referred to in theology asthe \"murderer\" and the LIAR to God! Jehovah tempts the King of Israel to number the people, and Satan tempts him to do the samein another place. Jehovah turns into the fiery serpents to bite those he is displeased with; and Jehovah informs the brazen serpent thatheals them.These short, and seemingly contradictory, statements in the Old Testament (contradictory because the two Powers are separatedinstead of being regarded as the two faces of one and the same thing) are the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 415 THEOLOGICAL ETYMOLOGIES.echoes -- distorted out of recognition by exotericism and theology -- of the universal and philosophical dogmas in nature, so wellunderstood by the primitive Sages. We find the same groundwork in several personifications in the Puranas, only far more ample andphilosophically suggestive.Thus Pulastya, a \"Son of God\" -- one of the first progeny -- is made the progenitor of Demons, the Rakshasas, the tempters and theDevourers of men. Pisacha (female Demon) is a daughter of Daksha, a \"Son of God\" too, and a God, and the mother of all thePisachas (Padma Purana). The Demons, so called in the Puranas, are very extraordinary devils when judged from the standpoint ofEuropean and orthodox views about these creatures, since all of them -- Danavas, Daityas, Pisachas, and the Rakshasas -- arerepresented as extremely pious, following the precepts of the Vedas, some of them even being great Yogis. But they oppose theclergy and Ritualism, sacrifices and forms -- just what the full-blown Yogins do to this day in India -- and are no less respected for it,though they are allowed to follow neither caste nor ritual; hence all those Puranic giants and Titans are called Devils. TheMissionaries, ever on the watch to show, if they can, the Hindu traditions no better than a reflection of the Jewish Bible, have evolveda whole romance on the alleged identity of Pulastya with Cain, and of the Rakshasas with the Cainites, \"the accursed,\" the cause ofthe Noachian Deluge. (See the work of Abbe Gorresio, who \"etymologises\" Pulastya's name as meaning the \"rejected,\" hence Cain, ifyou please). Pulastya dwells in Kedara, he says, which means a \"dug-up place,\" a mine, and Cain is shown in tradition and the Bibleas the first worker in metals and a miner thereof!While it is very probable that the Gibborim (the giants) of the Bible are the Rakshasas of the Hindus, it is still more certain that bothare Atlanteans, and belong to the submerged races. However it may be, no Satan could be more persistent in slandering his enemy,or more spiteful in his hatred, than the Christian theologians are in cursing him as the father of every evil. Compare their vituperationsand opinions given about the Devil with the philosophical views of the Puranic sages and their Christ-like mansuetude. WhenParasara, whose father was devoured by a Rakshasa, was preparing himself to destroy (magically) the whole race, his grandsire,Vasishta, says a few extremely suggestive words to him. He shows the irate Sage, on his own confession, that there is Evil and Karma,but no \"evil spirits.\" \"Let thy wrath be appeased,\" he says. \"The Rakshasas are not culpable; thy father's death was the work of Karma.Anger is the passion of fools; it becometh not a wise man. By whom, it may be asked, is any one killed? Every man reaps theconsequences of his own acts. Anger, my son, is the destruction of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 416 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"all that man obtains . . . and prevents the attainment of emancipation. The sages shun wrath. Be not thou, my child, subject to itsinfluence. Let not those unoffending spirits of darkness be consumed; let thy sacrifice cease. Mercy is the might of the righteous\"(Vishnu Purana, Book i., ch. i.). Thus, every such \"sacrifice\" or prayer to God for help is no better than an act of black magic. Thatwhich Parasara prayed for, was the destruction of the Spirits of Darkness, for his personal revenge. He is called a Pagan, and theChristians have doomed him as such, to eternal hell. Yet, in what respect is the prayer of sovereigns and generals, who pray beforeevery battle for the destruction of their enemy, any better? Such a prayer is in every case black magic of the worst kind, concealed likea demon \"Mr. Hyde\" under a sanctimonious \"Dr. Jekyll.\"In human nature, evil denotes only the polarity of matter and Spirit, a struggle for life between the two manifested Principles inSpace and Time, which principles are one per se, inasmuch they are rooted in the Absolute. In Kosmos, the equilibrium must bepreserved. The operations of the two contraries produce harmony, like the centripetal and centrifugal forces, which are necessary toeach other -- mutually inter-dependent -- \"in order that both should live.\" If one is arrested, the action of the other will becomeimmediately self-destructive.Since the personification called Satan has been amply analyzed from its triple aspect -- in the Old Testament, Christian theology andthe ancient Gentile attitude of thought -- those who would learn more of it are referred to Vol. II. of ISIS UNVEILED, chap. x. See alsoseveral sections in Book II., Part II. of this work. The present subject is touched upon and fresh explanations attempted for a very goodreason. Before we can approach the evolution of physical and divine man, we have first to master the idea of cyclic evolution, toacquaint ourselves with the philosophies and beliefs of the four races which preceded our present race, to learn what were the ideas ofthose Titans and giants -- giants, verily, mentally as well as physically. The whole of antiquity was imbued with that philosophy whichteaches the involution of spirit into matter, the progressive, downward cyclic descent, or active, self-conscious evolution. TheAlexandrian Gnostics have sufficiently divulged the secret of initiations, and their records are full of \"the sliding down of AEons\" intheir double qualification of Angelic Beings and Periods: the one the natural evolution of the other. On the other hand, Orientaltraditions on both sides of the \"black water\" -- the oceans that separate the two Easts -- are as full of allegories about the downfall ofPleroma, of that of the gods and Devas. One and all, they allegorized and explained the FALL as the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 417 THE ANGELS SLANDERED.desire to learn and acquire knowledge -- to KNOW. This is the natural sequence of mental evolution, the spiritual becomingtransmuted into the material or physical. The same law of descent into materiality and re-ascent into spirituality asserted itself duringthe Christian era, the reaction having stopped only just now, in our own special sub-race.That which, perhaps ten millenniums ago, was allegorized in Pymander in a triune character of interpretation, meant as a record ofan astronomical, anthropological, and even alchemical fact, namely, the allegory of the seven rectors breaking through the sevencircles of fire, was dwarfed into one material and anthropomorphic interpretation -- the rebellion and Fall of the Angels. Themultivocal, profoundly philosophical narrative, under its poetical form of the \"Marriage of Heaven with Earth,\" the love of nature forDivine form and the \"Heavenly man,\" enraptured with his own beauty mirrored in nature -- i.e., Spirit attracted into matter -- has nowbecome, under theological handling: \"the seven Rectors disobeying Jehovah, self admiration generating Satanic Pride, followed bytheir FALL, Jehovah permitting no worship to be lost save upon himself.\" In short, the beautiful Planet-Angels, the glorious cyclicaeons of the ancients, became henceforward synthesized in their most orthodox shape in Samael, the chief of the Demons in theTalmud, \"That great serpent with twelve wings that draws down after himself, in his Fall, the solar system, or the Titans.\" But Schemal,the alter ego and the Sabean type of Samael, meant, in his philosophical and esoteric aspect, the \"year\" in its astrological evilaspect, its twelve months or wings of unavoidable evils, in nature; and in esoteric theogony (see Chwolson in NABATHEANAGRICULTURE, Vol. II., p. 217), both Schemal and Samael represented a particular divinity. With the Kabalists they are \"the Spirit ofthe Earth,\" the personal god that governs it, identical de facto with Jehovah. For the Talmudists admit themselves that SAMAEL is agod-name of one of the seven Elohim. The Kabalists, moreover, show the two, Schemal and Samael, as a symbolical form of Saturn,CHRONOS, the twelve wings standing for the 12 months, and the symbol in its collectivity representing a racial cycle. Jehovah andSaturn are also glyphically identical.This leads in its turn to a very curious deduction from a Roman Catholic dogma. Many renowned writers belonging to the LatinChurch admit that a difference exists, and should be made, between the Uranian Titans, the antediluvian giants (also Titans), andthose post-diluvian giants in whom they (the Roman Catholics) will see the descendants of the mythical Ham. In clearer words, there isa difference to be made between the Cosmic, primordial opposing Forces -- guided by cyclic law -- the Atlantean human giants, andthe post-diluvian great adepts, whether------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 418 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of the right or the left hand. At the same time they show that Michael, \"the generalissimos of the fighting Celestial Host, thebodyguard of Jehovah,\" as it would seem (see de Mirville) is also a Titan, only with the adjective of \"divine\" before the cognomen.Thus those \"Uranides\" who are called everywhere \"divine Titans,\" and who, having rebelled against Kronos (Saturn), are thereforealso shown to be the enemies of Samael (an Elohim, also and synonymous with Jehovah in his collectivity), are identical withMichael and his host. In short, the roles are reversed, all the combatants are confused, and no student is able to distinguish clearlywhich is which. Esoteric explanation may, however, bring some order into this confusion, in which Jehovah becomes Saturn, andMichael and his army, Satan and the rebellious angels, owing to the indiscreet endeavours of the too faithful zealots to see in every"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"pagan god a devil. The true meaning is far more philosophical, and the legend of the first \"Fall\" (of the angels) assumes a scientificcolouring when correctly understood.Kronos stands for endless (hence immovable) Duration, without beginning, without an end, beyond divided Time and beyond Space.Those \"Angels,\" genii, or Devas, who were born to act in space and time, i.e., to break through the seven circles of the superspiritualplanes into the phenomenal, or circumscribed, super-terrestrial regions, are said allegorically to have rebelled against Kronos andfought the (then) one living and highest God. In his turn, when Kronos is represented as mutilating Uranus, his father, the meaning ofthis mutilation is very simple: Absolute Time is made to become the finite and the conditioned; a portion is robbed from the whole,thus showing that Saturn, the father of the gods, has been transformed from Eternal Duration into a limited Period. Chronos cuts downwith his scythe even the longest and (to us) seemingly endless cycles, yet, for all that, limited in Eternity, and puts down with the samescythe the mightiest rebels. Aye, not one will escape the scythe of Time! Praise the god or gods, or flout, one or both, and that scythewill not be made to tremble one millionth of a second in its ascending or descending course.The Titans of Hesiod's Theogony were copied in Greece from the Suras and Asuras of India. These Hesiodic Titans, the Uranides,numbered once upon a time as only six, have been recently discovered to be seven -- the seventh being called Phoreg -- in an oldfragment relating to the Greek myth. Thus their identity with the Seven rectors is fully demonstrated. The origin of the \"War inHeaven\" and the FALL has, in our mind, to be traced unavoidably to India, and perhaps far earlier than the Puranic accounts thereof.For TARAMAYA was in a later age, and there are three accounts, each of a distinct war, to be traced in almost every Cosmogony.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 419 THE WAR OF THE GODS.The first war happened in the night of time, between the gods the (A)-suras, and lasted for the period of one \"divine year.\"* On thisoccasion the deities were defeated by the Daityas, under the leadership of Hrada. After that, owing to a device of Vishnu, to whom theconquered gods applied for help, the latter defeated the Asuras. In the Vishnu Purana no interval is found between the two wars. Inthe Esoteric Doctrine, one war takes place before the building of the Solar system; another, on earth, at the \"creation\" of man; and athird \"war\" is mentioned as taking place at the close of the 4th Race, between its adepts and those of the 5th Race, i.e., between theInitiates of the \"Sacred Island\" and the Sorcerers of Atlantis. We shall notice the first contest, as recounted by Parasara, while trying toseparate the two accounts, purposely blended together. It is there stated that as the Daityas and Asuras were engaged in the duties oftheir respective orders (Varna) and followed the paths prescribed by holy writ, practising also religious penance (a queer employmentfor demons if they are identical with our devils, as it is claimed) -- it was impossible for the gods to destroy them. The prayersaddressed by the gods to Vishnu are curious as showing the ideas involved in an anthropomorphic deity. Having, after their defeat,\"fled to the Northern shore of the Milky Ocean (Atlantic Ocean),** the discomfited gods address many supplications \"to the first[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* One \"Day of Brahma\" lasting 4,320,000,000 years -- multiply this by 365! The Asuras here (no-gods, but demons) are still Suras,gods higher in hierarchy than such secondary gods as are not even mentioned in the Vedas. The duration of the war shows itssignificance, and that they are only the personified Cosmic powers. It is evidently for sectarian purposes and out of odiumtheologicum that the illusive form assumed by Vishnu Mayamoha, was attributed in later rearrangements of old texts to Buddha andthe Daityas, in the Vishnu Purana, unless it was a fancy of Wilson himself. He also fancied he found an allusion to Buddhism inBhagavatgita, whereas, as proved by K. T. Telang, he had only confused the Buddhists and the older Charvaka materialists. Theversion exists nowhere in other Puranas if the inference does, as Professor Wilson claims, in the \"Vishnu Purana\"; the translation ofwhich, especially of Book iii., ch. xviii., where the reverend Orientalist arbitrarily introduces Buddha, and shows him teachingBuddhism to Daityas -- led to another \"great war\" between himself and Col. Vans Kennedy. The latter charged him publicly withwilfully distorting Puranic texts. \"I affirm,\" wrote the Colonel at Bombay, in 1840, \"that the Puranas do not contain what ProfessorWilson has stated is contained in them . . . until such passages are produced I may be allowed to repeat my former conclusions, thatProfessor Wilson's opinion, that the Puranas as now extant are compilations made between the eighth and seventeenth centuries(A.D.!) rests solely on gratuitous assumptions and unfounded assertions, and that his reasoning in support of it is either futile,fallacious, contradictory, or improbable.\" (See Vishnu Purana, trans. by Wilson, edit. by Fitzedward Hall, Vol. V., Appendix.)** This statement belongs to the third War, since the terrestrial continents, seas and rivers are mentioned in connection with it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 420 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of beings, the divine Vishnu,\" and among others this one: \"Glory to thee, who art one with the Saints, whose perfect nature is everblessed. . . .

O Lord, who hast neither colour nor extension, nor size (ghana), nor any predicablequalities, and whose essence (rupa), purest of the pure is appreciable only by holy Paramarshi (greatest of sages or Rishis).

Purana.)The above is quoted as an illustration of the vast field offered by the Puranas to adverse and erroneous criticism, by every Europeanbigot who forms an estimate of an alien religion on mere external evidence.

Thus, he exclaims:--*\"The Puranas constantly teach incompatible doctrines! According to this passage, the Supreme being is not the inert cause ofcreation only, but exercises the functions of an active providence. The Commentator quotes a text of the Veda in support of this view:'Universal Soul entering into men, governs their conduct.' Incongruities, however, are as frequent in the Vedas as in the Puranas. . . ..\"Less frequent, in sober truth, than in the Mosaic Bible. But prejudice is great in the hearts of our Orientalists -- especially in those of\"reverend\" scholars. UNIVERSAL SOUL is not the inert Cause of Creation or (Para) Brahma, but simply that which we call the sixthprinciple of intellectual Kosmos, on the manifested plane of being. It is Mahat, or Mahabuddhi, the great Soul, the vehicle of Spirit,the first primeval reflection of the formless CAUSE, and that which is even beyond SPIRIT.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In Book I., chap. xvii., narrating the story of Prahlada -- the Son of Hiranyakasipu, the Puranic Satan, the great enemy of Vishnu, andthe King of the three worlds -- into whose heart Vishnu entered.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 421 THE DECEPTION OF THE GODS.So much for Professor Wilson's uncalled-for fling. As for the apparently incongruous appeal to Vishnu by the defeated gods, theexplanation is there, in the text of Vishnu Purana, if Orientalists would only notice it.* There is Vishnu, as Brahma, and Vishnu in histwo aspects, philosophy teaches. There is but one Brahma, \"essentially prakriti and Spirit,\" &c.Therefore, it is not Vishnu -- \"the inert cause of creation\" -- which exercised the functions of an active Providence, but the UniversalSoul, that which E. Levi calls Astral Light in its material aspect. And this \"Soul\" is, in its dual aspect of spirit and matter, the trueanthropomorphic God of the Theists; as this God is a personification of that Universal Creative Agent, pure and impure both, owing toits manifested condition and differentiation in this Mayavic World -- God and Devil -- truly. But Dr. Wilson failed to see how Vishnu, inthis character, closely resembles the Lord God of Israel, \"especially in his policy of deception, temptation, and cunning.\"In the Vishnu Purana this is made as plain as can be. For it is said there, that \"at the conclusion of their prayers (stotra) the godsbeheld the Sovereign Deity Hari (Vishnu) armed with the conch, the discus, and the mace, riding on Garuda. .\" Now \"Garuda\" is themanvantaric cycle, as will be shown in its place. Vishnu, therefore, is the deity in space and time; the peculiar God of the Vaishnavas(a tribal or racial God, as they are called in esoteric philosophy): i.e., one of the many Dhyanis or Gods, or Elohim, one of whom wasgenerally chosen for some special reasons by a nation or a tribe, and thus became gradually a \"God above all Gods\" (2 Chronicles ii.5,) the \"highest God\" as Jehovah, Osiris, Bel, or any other of the Seven Regents.\"The tree is known by its fruit,\" -- the nature of a God by his actions. The latter, we have either to judge by the dead-letter narratives,or to accept allegorically. If we compare the two -- Vishnu, as the defender and champion of the defeated gods; and Jehovah, thedefender and champion of the \"chosen\" people, so called by antiphrasis, no doubt, as it is the Jews who had chosen that \"jealous\"God -- we shall find that both use deceit and cunning.

Thus while (according to the Kabalists) Jehovah assumes the shape of the temptingSerpent in the Garden of Eden; sends Satan with a special mission to tempt Job; and harasses and wearies Pharaoh with Sarai,Abraham's wife, and \"hardens\" his heart against Moses, lest there should be no opportunity for plaguing his victims \"with greatplagues\" (Genesis xii., Exodus) -- Vishnu is made in his Purana to resort to a trick no less unworthy of any respectable god.\"Have compassion upon us, O Lord, and protect us, who have come to thee for succour from the Daityas (demons)!\" pray the defeatedGods. \"They have seized upon the three worlds, and appropriated the offerings which are our portion, taking care not to transgress thePrecepts of the Veda.

Go then and fear not. Let this delusive vision precede you. It shall this day be of great serviceunto you, O Gods!\"\"After this, the great Delusion, Mayamoha, descending to earth, beheld the Daityas engaged in ascetic penances, and approachingthem, in the semblance of a Digambara (naked mendicant) with his head shaven . . . he thus addressed them, in gentle accents: \"Ho,lords of the Daitya race, wherefore is it that you practise these acts of penances?\" etc., etc. (Book II., xviii.).Finally the Daityas were seduced by the wily talk of Mahamoha, as Eve was seduced by the advice of the Serpent. They becameapostates to the Vedas. As Dr. Muir translates the passage:--\"The great Deceiver, practising illusion, next beguiled other Daityas, by means of many other sorts of heresy. In a very short time,these Asuras (-Daityas) deluded by the Deceiver (who was Vishnu) abandoned the entire system founded on the ordinances of thetriple Veda. Some reviled the Vedas, others the Gods, others the ceremonial of sacrifice, and others the Brahmans. This, theyexclaimed, is a doctrine which will not bear discussion. The slaughter of animals in sacrifice is not conducive to religious merit. To saythat oblations of butter consumed in the fire produce any future reward, is the assertion of a child. . . . If it be a fact that a beast slainin sacrifice is exalted to heaven, why does not the worshipper slaughter his own father? . . . .

Then followed a combatbetween the gods and the Asuras; and the latter, who had abandoned the right road, were smitten by the former. In previous timesthey had been defended by the armour of righteousness which they bore, but when that had been destroyed they, also, perished.\"(Journal of the Royal Asiat. Society, Vol. XIX., p. 302.)Whatever may be thought of Hindus, no enemy of theirs can regard them as fools. A people whose holy men and sages have left tothe world the greatest and most sublime philosophies that ever emanated from the minds of men, must have known the differencebetween right and wrong. Even a savage can discern white from black, good from bad, and deceit from sincerity and truthfulness.Those who had narrated this event in the biography of their god, must have seen that in this case it was that God who was the arch-Deceiver, and the Daityas, who \"never transgressed the precepts of the Vedas,\" who had the sunny side in the transaction, and whowere the true \"Gods.\" Thence there must have been, and there is a secret meaning hidden under this allegory. In no class of Society,in no nation, are deceit and craft considered as Divine virtues -- except perhaps in the clerical classes of theologians and modernJesuitism.The Vishnu Purana,* like all other works of this kind, has passed at a later period into the hands of the temple-Brahmins, and the oldMSS. have, no doubt, been once more tampered with by sectarians. But there was a time when the Puranas were esoteric works, andso they are still for the Initiates who can read them with the key that is in their possession.Whether the Brahmin Initiates will ever give out the full meaning of these allegories, is a question with which the writer is notconcerned. The present object is to show that, while honouring the creative Powers in their multiple forms, no philosopher could, orever has, accepted the allegory for the true Spirit, except, perhaps, some philosophers belonging to the present \"superior andcivilized\" Christian races. For, as shown, Jehovah is not one whit the superior of Vishnu on the plane of ethics. This is why theOccultists and even some Kabalists, whether they regard or not those creative Forces as living and conscious Entities -- and one doesnot see why they should not be so accepted -- will never confuse the CAUSE with the effect, and accept the Spirit of the Earth forParabrahm or Ain-Soph. At all events they know well the true nature of what was called Father-AEther by the Greeks, Jupiter-Titan,etc., etc. They know that the soul of the ASTRAL LIGHT is divine, and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Wilson's opinion that the \"Vishnu Purana\" is a production of our era, and that in its present form it is not earlier than between theVIIIth and the XVIIth (!!) century, is absurd beyond noticing.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 424 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.its body (the light-waves on the lower planes) infernal.

Exact science -- could the latter soar sohigh, while tracing the operations of nature to their ultimate and original sources -- would call this idea the hierarchy of Forces. Theoriginal, transcendental and philosophical conception was one. But as systems began to reflect with every age more and more theidiosyncracies of nations; and as the latter, after separating, settled into distinct groups, each evolving along its own national or tribalgroove, the main idea gradually became veiled with the overgrowth of human fancy. While in some countries the FORCES, or ratherthe intelligent Powers of nature, received divine honours they were hardly entitled to, in others -- as now in Europe and the civilizedlands -- the very thought of any such Force being endowed with intelligence seems absurd, and is proclaimed unscientific. Thereforeone finds relief in such statements as are found in the Introduction to \"Asgard and the Gods: Tales and Traditions of our NorthernAncestors,\" by W. S. W. Anson. The author remarks, on p. 3: \"Although in Central Asia, or on the banks of the Indus, in the land of thePyramids, and in the Greek and Italian peninsulas, and even in the North, whither Kelts, Teutons and Slavs wandered, the religiousconceptions of the people have taken different forms, yet their common origin is still perceptible. We point out this connectionbetween the stories of the gods, and the deep thought contained in them, and their importance, in order that the reader may see thatit is not a magic world of erratic fancy which opens out before him, but that . . . Life and nature formed the basis of the existence andaction of these divinities.\" And though it is impossible for any Occultist or student of Eastern Esotericism to concur in the strange ideathat \"the religious con-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 425 MYTH IS ORAL TRADITION.ceptions of the most famous nations of antiquity are connected with the beginnings of civilization amongst the Germanic races,\" he isyet glad to find such truths expressed as that: \"These fairy tales are not senseless stories written for the amusement of the idle; theyembody the profound religion of our forefathers . . . \"Precisely so. Not only their religion, but likewise their History. For a myth, in Greek [[mythos]], means oral tradition, passed from mouthto mouth from one generation to the other; and even in the modern etymology the term stands for a fabulous statement conveyingsome important truth; a tale of some extraordinary personage whose biography has become overgrown, owing to the veneration ofsuccessive generations, with rich popular fancy, but which is no wholesale fable. Like our ancestors, the primitive Aryans, we believefirmly in the personality and intelligence of more than one phenomenon-producing Force in nature.As time rolled on, the archaic teaching grew dimmer; and those nations more or less lost sight of the highest and One principle of allthings, and began to transfer the abstract attributes of the \"causeless cause\" to the caused effects -- become in their turn causative --the creative Powers of the Universe: the great nations, out of the fear of profaning the IDEA, the smaller, because they either failed tograsp it or lacked the power of philosophic conception needed to preserve it in all its immaculate purity. But one and all, with theexception of the latest Aryans, now become Europeans and Christians, show this veneration in their Cosmogonies. As Thomas Taylor,*the most intuitional of all the translators of Greek Fragments, shows, no nation has ever conceived the One principle as the immediatecreator of the visible Universe, for no sane man would credit a planner and architect with having built the edifice he admires with hisown hands. On the testimony of Damascius ([[Peri archon]]) they referred to it as \"the Unknown DARKNESS.\" The Babylonians passedover this principle in silence: \"To that god,\" says Porphyry, in [[Peri apoches empsuchon]], \"who is above all things, neither externalspeech ought to be addressed, nor yet that which is inward. . . . .\" Hesiod begins his theogony with: \"Chaos of all things was the firstproduced,\"** thus allowing the inference that its cause or producer must be passed over in reverential silence. Homer in his poemsascends no higher than Night, whom he represents Zeus as reverencing. According to all the ancient theologists, and to the doctrinesof Pythagoras and Plato, Zeus, or the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Magazine\" for April, 1797.** [[Etoi men protista chaos genet; geneto]] being considered in antiquity as meaning \"Was generated\" and not simply was.

Homer, therefore, is not only silent with respect to the first principle, but likewisewith respect to those two principles immediately posterior to the first, the AEther and Chaos of Orpheus and Hesiod, and the boundand infinity of Pythagoras and Plato.* . . . . Proclus says of this highest principle that it is. . . . \"the Unity of Unities, and beyond the firstadyte. . . . . more ineffable than all silence, and more occult than all Essence. . . . . concealed amidst the intelligible gods.\" (Ibid.)"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"To what was written by Thomas Taylor in 1797 -- namely, that the \"Jews appear to have ascended no higher. . . . than the immediateartificer of the universe\"; as \"Moses introduces a darkness on the face of the deep, without even insinuating that there was any causeof its existence,\"** one might add something more. Never have the Jews in their Bible (a purely esoteric, symbolical work) degraded soprofoundly their metaphorical deity as have the Christians, by accepting Jehovah as their one living yet personal God.This first, or rather ONE, principle was called \"the circle of Heaven,\" symbolized by the hierogram of a point within a circle orequilateral triangle, the point being the LOGOS. Thus, in the Rig Veda, wherein Brahma is not even named, Cosmogony is preludedwith the Hiranyagharha, \"the Golden Egg,\" and Prajapati (Brahma later on), from whom emanate all the hierarchies of \"Creators.\"The Monad, or point, is the original and is the unit from which follows the entire numeral system. This Point is the First Cause, butTHAT from which it emanates, or of which, rather, it is the expression, the Logos, is passed over in silence. In its turn, the universalsymbol, the point within the circle, was not yet the Architect, but the cause of that Architect; and the latter stood to it in precisely thesame relation as the point itself stood to the circumference of the Circle, which cannot be defined, according to Hermes Trismegistus.Porphyry shows that the Monad and the Duad of Pythagoras are identical with Plato's infinite and finite in \"Philebus\" -- or what Platocalls the [[apeiron]] and [[peras]]. It is the latter only (the mother) which is substantial, the former being the \"cause of all unity andmeasure of all things\" (Vit. Pyth. p. 47); the Duad (Mulaprakriti, the VEIL) being thus shown to be the mother of the Logos and, at thesame time, his daughter -- i.e., the object of his perception -- the produced[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is the \"bound\" confused with the \"Infinite,\" that Kapila overwhelms with sarcasms in his disputations with the Brahman Yogis, whoclaim in their mystical visions to see the \"Highest One.\"** See T.

With Pythagoras, the MONAD returns into silence and Darkness as soon as it has evolved thetriad, from which emanate the remaining seven numbers of the 10 (ten) numbers which are at the base of the manifested universe.In the Norse cosmogony it is again the same. \"In the beginning was a great abyss (Chaos), neither day nor night existed; the abyss wasGinnungagap, the yawning gulf, without beginning, without end. ALL FATHER, the Uncreated, the Unseen, dwelt in the depth of the'Abyss' (SPACE) and willed, and what was willed came into being.\" (See \"Asgard and the Gods.\") As in the Hindu cosmogony, theevolution of the universe is divided into two acts: called in India the Prakriti and Padma Creations. Before the warm rays pouring fromthe \"Home of Brightness\" awake life in the Great Waters of Space, the Elements of the first creation come into view, and from them isformed the Giant Ymir (also Orgelmir) -- primordial matter differentiated from Chaos (literally seething clay). Then comes the cowAudumla, the nourisher,* from whom is born Buri (the Producer) who, by Bestla, the daughter of the \"Frost-Giants\" (the sons of Ymir)had three sons, Odin, Willi and We, or \"Spirit,\" \"Will,\" and \"Holiness.\" (Compare the Genesis of the Primordial Races, in this work.)This was when Darkness still reigned throughout Space, when the Ases, the creative Powers (Dhyan Chohans) were not yet evolved,and the Yggdrasil, the tree of the universe of Time and of Life, had not yet grown, and there was, as yet, no Walhalla, or Hall ofHeroes. The Scandinavian legends of creation, of our earth and world, begin with time and human life. All that precedes it is for them\"Darkness,\" wherein All-Father, the cause of all, dwells. As observed by the editor of \"Asgard and the Gods,\" though these legendshave in them the idea of that ALL-FATHER, the original cause of all, \"he is scarcely more than mentioned in the poems,\" notbecause, as he thinks, before the preaching of the gospel, the idea \"could not rise to distinct conceptions of the Eternal,\" but onaccount of its great esoteric character. Therefore, all the creative gods, or personal Deities, begin at the secondary stage of Cosmicevolution. Zeus is born in, and out of Kronos -- Time. So is Brahma the production and emanation of Kala, \"eternity and time,\" Kalabeing one of the names of Vishnu. Hence we find Odin, the father of the gods and of the Ases, as Brahma is the father of the godsand of the Asuras, and hence also the androgyne character of all the chief creative gods, from the second MONAD of the Greeks downto the Sephiroth Adam Kadmon, the Brahma or Prajapati-Vach of the Vedas, and the androgyne of Plato, which is but anotherversion of the Indian symbol.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vach -- the \"melodious cow, who milks sustenance and water,\" and yields us \"nourishment and sustenance\" as described in Rig-Veda.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 428 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The best metaphysical definition of primeval theogony in the spirit of the Vedantins may be found in the \"Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita,\" by Mr. T.

This Mulaprakriti is materialto it (the Logos), as any material object is material to us. This Mulaprakriti is no more Parabrahmam than the bundle of attributes of apillar is the pillar itself; Parabrahmam is an unconditioned and absolute reality, and Mulaprakriti is a sort of veil thrown over it.Parabrahmam by itself cannot be seen as it is. It is seen by the Logos with a veil thrown over it, and that veil is the mighty expanse ofCosmic matter. . . .\" \"Parabrahmam, after having appeared on the one hand as the Ego, and on the other as Mulaprakriti, acts as theone energy through the Logos.\"And the lecturer explains what he means by this acting of something which is nothing, though it is the ALL, by a fine simile. Hecompares the Logos to the sun through which light and heat radiate, but whose energy, light and heat, exist in some unknowncondition in Space and are diffused in Space only as visible light and heat, the sun being only the agent thereof. This is the firsttriadic hypostasis.

AIN-SOPH, they taught, could not be comprehended, could not be located, nor named, though thecauseless cause of all. Hence its name -- AIN-SOPH -- is a term of negation, \"the inscrutable, the incognizable, and the unnameable.\"They made of it, therefore, a boundless circle, a sphere, of which human intellect, with the utmost stretch, could only perceive thevault. In the words of one who has unriddled much in the Kabalistical system, in one of its meanings thoroughly, in its numerical andgeometrical esotericism:-- \"Close your eyes, and from your own consciousness of perception try and think outward to the extremestlimits in every direction. You will find that equal lines or rays of perception extend out evenly in all directions, so that the utmost effortof perception will terminate in the vault of a sphere. The limitation of this sphere will, of necessity, be a great Circle, and the directrays of thought in any and every direction must be right line radii of the circle. This, then, must be, humanly speaking, the extremestall-embracing conception of the Ain-Soph manifest, which formulates itself as a geometrical figure, viz., of a circle, with its elementsof curved circumference and right line diameter divided into radii. Hence, a geometrical shape is the first recognisable means ofconnection between the Ain-Soph and the intelligence of man.\"*This great circle (which Eastern Esotericism reduces to the point within the Boundless Circle) is the Avalokiteswara, the Logos orVerbum of which Mr. Subba Row speaks. But this circle or manifested God is as unknown to us, except through its manifested universe,as the ONE, though easier, or rather more possible to our highest conceptions. This Logos which sleeps in the bosom of Parabrahmamduring Pralaya, as our \"Ego is latent (in us) at the time of sushupti, sleep\"; which cannot cognize Parabrahmam otherwise than asMulaprakriti -- the latter being a cosmic veil which is \"the mighty expanse of cosmic matter\" -- is thus only an organ in cosmic creation,through which radiate the energy and wisdom of Parabrahmam, unknown to the Logos, as it is to ourselves. Moreover, as the Logos isas unknown to us as Parabrahmam is unknown in reality to the Logos, both Eastern Esotericism and the Kabala -- in order to bring theLogos within the range of our conceptions -- have resolved the abstract synthesis into concrete images; viz., into the reflections ormultiplied aspects of that Logos or Avalokiteswara, Brahma, Ormazd, Osiris, Adam-Kadmon, call it by any of these names -- whichaspects or Manvantaric emanations are the Dhyan Chohans, the Elohim, the Devas, the Amshaspends, &c., &c.

In the Kabala, Sephira is the same as Shekinah, and is, in another synthesis, the wife,daughter, and mother of the \"Heavenly man,\" Adam Kadmon, and is even identical with him, just as Vach is identical with Brahma,and is called the female Logos. In the Rig-Veda, Vach is \"mystic speech,\" by whom Occult Knowledge and Wisdom arecommunicated to man, and thus Vach is said to have \"entered the Rishis.\" She is \"generated by the gods;\" she is the divine Vach --the \"Queen of gods\"; and she is associated -- like Sephira with the Sephiroth -- with the Prajapati in their work of creation. Moreover,she is called \"the mother of the Vedas,\" \"since it is through her power (as mystic speech) that Brahma revealed them, and also owingto her power that he produced the universe\" -- i.e., through speech, and words (synthesized by the \"WORD\") and numbers.****But Vach being also spoken of as the daughter of Daksha -- \"the god who lives in all the Kalpas\" -- her Mayavic character is therebyshown:[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Called, in the Bhagavat-Gita, Daiviprakriti.** Objective -- in the world of Maya, of course; still as real as we are.*** \"In the course of cosmic manifestation, this Daiviprakriti, instead of being the mother of the Logos, should, strictly speaking, becalled his daughter.\" (\"Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita,\" p. 305, Theosophist.)**** The wise men, like Stanley Jevons amongst the moderns, who invented the scheme which makes the incomprehensible assume atangible form, could only do so by resorting to numbers and geometrical figures.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 431 THE FEMALE LOGOI.during the pralaya she disappears, absorbed in the one, all-devouring Ray.But there are two distinct aspects in universal Esotericism, Eastern and Western, in all those personations of the female Power innature, or nature -- the noumenal and the phenomenal. One is its purely metaphysical aspect, as described by the learned lecturer inhis \"Notes on the Bhagavat-Gita;\" the other terrestrial and physical, and at the same time divine from the stand-point of practicalhuman conception and Occultism. They are all the symbols and personifications of Chaos, the \"Great Deep\" or the Primordial Watersof Space, the impenetrable VEIL between the INCOGNISABLE and the LOGOS of Creation. \"Connecting himself through his mindwith Vach, Brahma (the Logos) created the primordial waters.\" In the Kathaka Upanishad it is stated still more clearly: \"Prajapati wasthis Universe. Vach was a second to him. He associated with her . . . she produced these creatures and again re-entered Prajapati.\"*And here we may incidentally point out one of the many unjust slurs thrown by the pious and good missionaries in India on thereligion of the land. This allegory -- in the \"Satapatha Brahmana\" -- namely, that Brahma, as the father of men, performed the work ofprocreation by incestuous intercourse with his own daughter Vach, also called Sandhya (twilight), and Satarupa (the hundred formed),is incessantly thrown into the teeth of the Brahmins, as condemning their \"detestable, false religion.\" Besides the fact, convenientlyforgotten by the Europeans, that the Patriarch Lot is shown guilty of the same crime under the human form, whereas Brahma, or ratherPrajapati, accomplished the incest under the form of a buck with his daughter, who had that of a hind (rohit), the esoteric reading ofGenesis (ch. iii.) shows the same. Moreover, there is certainly a cosmic, not a physiological meaning attached to the Indian allegory,since Vach is a permutation of Aditi and Mulaprakriti (Chaos), and Brahma a permutation of Narayana, the Spirit of God entering into,and fructifying nature; therefore, there is nothing phallic in the conception at all.As already stated, Aditi-Vach is the female Logos, or the \"word,\" Verbum; and Sephira in the Kabala is the same. These feminineLogoi are all correlations, in their noumenal aspect, of Light, and Sound, and Ether, showing how well-informed were the ancientsboth in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This connects Vach and Sephira with the goddess Kwan-Yin, the \"merciful mother,\" the divine VOICE of the soul even in ExotericBuddhism; and with the female aspect of Kwan-Shai-yin, the Logos, the verbum of Creation, and at the same time with the voice thatspeaks audibly to the Initiate, according to Esoteric Buddhism.

Vaikhari Vach is what we utter.\" It is sound, speech, that again which becomes comprehensive and objective to oneof our physical senses and may be brought under the laws of perception. Hence: \"Every kind of Vaikhari-Vach exists in its Madhyama ."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":". . . Pasyanti and ultimately in its Para form. . . . . The reason why this Pranava* is called Vach is this, that these four principles of thegreat Kosmos correspond to these four forms of Vach. . . . . The whole Kosmos in its objective form is Vaikhari Vach; the light of theLogos is the madhyama form; and the Logos itself the pasyanti form; while Parabrahmam is the para (beyond the noumenon of allNoumena) aspect of that Vach.\" (Notes on the Bhagavad-Gita).Thus Vach, Shekinah, or the \"music of the spheres\" of Pythagoras, are one, if we take for our example instances in the three most(apparently) dissimilar religious philosophies in the world -- the Hindu, the Greek and the Chaldean Hebrew. These personations andallegories may be viewed under four (chief) and three (lesser) aspects or seven in all, as in Esotericism. The para form is the eversubjective and latent Light and Sound, which exist eternally in the bosom of the INCOGNISABLE; when transferred into the ideationof the Logos, or its latent light, it is called pasyanti, and when it becomes that light expressed, it is madhyama.Now the Kabala gives the definition thus: \"There are three kinds of light, and that (fourth) which interpenetrates the others; (1) theclear and the penetrating, the objective light, (2) the reflected light, and (3) the abstract light.

In Exotericism one will always find 10 and 7, of either Sephiroth or Prajapati; in Esoteric rendering always 3and 7, which yield also 10. Only when divided in the manifested sphere into 3 and 7, they form [[diagram]], the androgyne, and[[diagram]], or the figure X manifested and differentiated.This will help the student to understand why Pythagoras esteemed the Deity (the Logos) to be the centre of unity and \"Source ofHarmony.\" We say this Deity was the Logos, not the MONAD that dwelleth in Solitude and Silence, because Pythagoras taught thatUNITY being indivisible is no number. And this is also why it was required of the candidate, who applied for admittance into hisschool, that he should have already studied as a preliminary step, the Sciences of Arithmetic, Astronomy, Geometry and Music, heldas the four divisions of Mathematics.*** Again, this explains why the Pythagoreans asserted that the doctrine of Numbers -- the chief ofall in Esotericism -- had been revealed to man by the celestial deities; that the world had been called forth out of Chaos by Sound orHarmony, and constructed according to the principles of musical proportion; that the seven planets which rule the destiny of mortalshave a harmonious motion \"and intervals corresponding to musical diastemes, rendering various sounds, so perfectly consonant, thatthey produce the sweetest melody, which is inaudible to us, only by reason of the greatness of the sound, which our ears areincapable of receiving.\" (Censorinus.)In the Pythagorean Theogony the hierarchies of the heavenly Host and Gods were numbered and expressed numerically.

Isis is also mystic Nature and also Earth; and her cow's horns identify her with Vach. The latter, after having beenrecognised in her highest form as para, becomes at the lower or material end of creation -- Vaikhari. Hence she is mystic, thoughphysical, Nature, with all her magic ways and properties.Again, as goddess of Speech and of Sound, and a permutation of Aditi -- she is Chaos, in one sense. At any rate, she is the \"Mother ofthe gods,\" and it is from Brahma (Iswara, or the Logos) and Vach, as from Adam Kadmon and Sephira, that the real manifestedtheogony has to start. Beyond, all is darkness and abstract speculation. With the Dhyan Chohans, or the gods, the Seers, the Prophetsand the adepts in general are on firm ground. Whether as Aditi, or the divine Sophia of the Greek Gnostics, she is the mother of theseven sons: the \"Angels of the Face,\" of the \"Deep,\" or the \"Great Green One\" of the \"Book of the Dead.\" Says the Book of Dzyan(Knowledge through meditation) --\"The great mother lay with [[diagram]], and the |, and the [[diagram]], the second | and the [[diagram]]* in her bosom, ready to bringthem forth, the valiant sons of the [[diagram]] [[diagram]] || (or 4,320,000, the Cycle) whose two elders are the [[diagram]] and the(Point).\"At the beginning of every cycle of 4,320,000, the Seven (or, as some nations had it, eight) great gods, descended to establish the neworder of things and give the impetus to the new cycle.

Bunsen was right in admitting for Egypt an antiquity of over 21,000 years, but thisconcession hardly exhausts truth and fact in this question. \"The stories told by Egyptian priests and others of time-keeping in Egypt,are now beginning to look less like lies in the sight of all who have escaped from biblical bondage,\" writes the author of \"The NaturalGenesis.\" \"Inscriptions have lately been found at Sakkarah, making mention of two Sothiac cycles . . . registered at that time, nowsome 6,000 years ago. Thus when Herodotus was in Egypt, the Egyptians had -- as now known -- observed at least five differentSothiac cycles of 1,461 years. The priests informed the Greek inquirer that time had been reckoned by them for so long that the sunhad twice risen where it then set, and twice set where it then arose. This . . . can only be realized as a fact in nature by means of twocycles of Precession, or a period of 51,736 years,\" (vol. ii, p. 318. But see in our Book II., \"CHRONOLOGY OF THE BRAHMINS.\")Mor Isaac (See Kircher's OEdipus, vol. ii., p. 425) shows the ancient Syrians defining their world of the \"Rulers\" and \"active gods\" inthe same way as the Chaldeans. The lowest world was the SUBLUNARY -- our own -- watched by the \"Angels\" of the first or lowerorder; the one that came next in rank, was Mercury, ruled by the \"ARCHANGELS\"; then came Venus, whose gods were thePRINCIPALITIES; the fourth was that of the SUN, the domain and region of the highest and mightiest gods of our system, the solargods of all nations; the fifth was Mars, ruled by the \"VIRTUES\"; the sixth -- that of Bel or Jupiter -- was governed by the DOMINIONS;the seventh -- the world of Saturn -- by the THRONES. These are the worlds of form. Above come the four higher ones, making sevenagain, since the three highest are \"unmentionable and unpronounceable.\" The eighth, composed of 1,122 stars, is the domain of theCherubs; the ninth, belonging to the walking and numberless stars on account of their distance, has the seraphs; as to the tenth --Kircher, quoting Mor Isaac, says that it is composed \"of invisible stars that could be taken, they said, for clouds -- so massed are they inthe zone that we call Via Straminis, the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Appearing at the beginning of Cycles, as also of every sidereal year (of 25,868 years) therefore the Kabeiri or Kabarim received theirname in Chaldea, as it means the measures of Heaven from Kob -- measure of, and Urim -- heavens.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 436 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Milky Way\"; and he hastens to explain that \"these are the stars of Lucifer, engulfed with him in his terrible shipwreck.\" That whichcomes after and beyond the tenth world (our Quaternary, or the Arupa world), the Syrians could not tell. \"All they knew was that it isthere that begins the vast and incomprehensible ocean of the infinite, the abode of the true divinity without boundary or end.\""},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Champollion shows the same belief among the Egyptians. Hermes having spoken of the Father-Mother and Son, whose spirit(collectively the DIVINE FIAT) shapes the Universe, says:-- \"Seven Agents (mediums) were also formed, to contain the material (ormanifested) worlds, within their respective circles and the action of these agents was named DESTINY.\" He further enumerates sevenand ten and twelve orders, which would take too long to detail here.As the \"Rig Vidhana\" together with the \"Brahmanda Purana\" and all such works, whether describing the magic efficacy of the Rig-Vedic Mantras or the future Kalpas, are declared by Dr. Weber and others to be modern compilations \"belonging probably only to thetime of the Puranas,\" it is useless to refer the reader to their mystic explanations; and one may as well quote simply from the archaicbooks utterly unknown to the Orientalists. These works explain that which so puzzles the scholars, namely that the Saptarshi, the\"mind-born sons\" of Brahma, are referred to in the Satapatha Brahmana under one set of names; in the Mahabharata under anotherset; and that the Vayu Purana makes even nine instead of seven Rishis, by adding the names of Bhrigu and Daksha to the list. But thesame occurs in every exoteric Scripture. The secret doctrine gives a long genealogy of Rishis, but separates them into many classes.Like the Gods of the Egyptians, who were divided into seven, and even twelve, classes, so are the Indian Rishis in their Hierarchies.The first three groups are the Divine, the Cosmical and the Sub-lunary. Then come the Solar Gods of our system, the Planetary, theSub-Mundane, and the purely human -- the heroes and the Manoushi.At present, however, we are only concerned with the pre-cosmic, divine gods, the Prajapati or the \"Seven Builders.\" This group isfound unmistakably in every Cosmogony. Owing to the loss of Egyptian archaic documents -- since, according to M. Maspero, \"thematerials and historical data on hand to study the history of the religious evolution in Egypt are neither complete nor very oftenintelligible\" -- in order to have the statements brought forward from the Secret Doctrine corroborated partially and indirectly, theancient hymns and inscriptions on the tombs must be appealed to. One such, at any rate, shows that Osiris was, like Brahma-Prajapati,Adam Kadmon, Ormazd, and so many other Logoi, the chief and synthesis of the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 437 COSMIC GODS.group of \"Creators\" or Builders. Before Osiris became the \"One\" and the highest god of Egypt he was worshipped at Abydos as thehead or leader of the Heavenly Host of the Builders belonging to the higher of the three orders. The hymn engraved on the votivestela of a tomb from Abydos (3rd register) addresses Osiris thus: \"Salutations to thee, Osiris, elder son of Sib; thou the greatest over thesix gods issued from the goddess Noo (primordial Water), thou the great favourite of thy father Ra; father of fathers, King of Duration,master in the eternity . . . who, as soon as these issued from thy mother's bosom, gathered all the crowns and attached the Uraeus(serpent or naja)* on thy head; multiform god, whose name is unknown and who has many names in towns and provinces. . .\" Comingout from the primordial water crowned with the uraeus, which is the serpent emblem of Cosmic fire, and himself the seventh over thesix primary gods issued from Father-Mother, Nou and Nout (the sky), who can Osiris be, but the chief Prajapati, the chief Sephiroth, thechief Amshaspend-Ormazd! That this latter solar and cosmic god stood, in the beginning of religious evolution, in the same positionas the archangel \"whose name was secret,\" is certain. This Archangel was the representative on earth of the Hidden Jewish God,Michael, in short: it is his \"Face\" that is said to have gone before the Jews like a \"Pillar of Fire.\" Burnouf says, \"The sevenAmshaspends, who are most assuredly our archangels, designate also the personifications of the divine Virtues.\" (Comment on theYacna, p. 174.) And these archangels, therefore, are as \"certainly\" the Saptarishi of the Hindus, though it is next to impossible to classeach with its pagan prototype and parallel, since, as in the case of Osiris, they have all so \"many names in towns and provinces.\"Some of the most important, however, will be shown in their order.One thing is thus undeniably proven. The more one studies their Hierarchies and finds out their identity, the more proofs one acquiresthat there is not one of the past and present personal gods, known to us from the earliest days of History, that does not belong to thethird stage of Cosmic manifestation. In every religion we find the concealed deity forming the ground work; then the ray therefrom,that falls into primordial Cosmic matter (first manifestation); then the androgyne result, the dual Male and Female abstract Force,personified (second stage); this separates itself finally, in the third, into seven Forces, called the creative Powers by all the ancientReligions, and the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This Egyptian word Naja reminds one a good deal of the Indian Naga, the Serpent-God.

The later explanation and metaphysical abstract qualifications have never prevented the Romanand Greek Churches from worshipping these \"Virtues\" under the personifications and distinct names of the seven Archangels. In theBook of Druschim (p. 59, 1st Treatise) in the Talmud, a distinction between these groups is given which is the correct Kabalisticalexplanation. It says:\"There are three groups (or orders) of Sephiroth. 1st. The Sephiroth called \"the divine attributes\" (abstract). 2nd. The physical orsidereal Sephiroth (personal) -- one group of seven, the other of ten. 3rd. The metaphysical Sephiroth, or periphrasis of Jehovah, whoare the first three Sephiroth (Kether, Chochma and Binah), the rest of the seven being the (personal) seven spirits of the Presence\"(also of the planets)."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The same division has to be applied to the primary, secondary and tertiary evolution of gods in every theogony, if one wishes totranslate the meaning esoterically. We must not confuse the purely metaphysical personifications of the abstract attributes of Deity,with their reflection -- the sidereal gods. This reflection, however, is in reality the objective expression of the abstraction: living Entitiesand the models formed on that divine prototype. Moreover, the three metaphysical Sephiroth or \"the periphrasis of Jehovah\" are notJehovah; it is the latter himself with the additional titles of Adonai, Elohim, Sabbaoth, and the numerous names lavished on him,who is the periphrasis of the Shaddai, [[hebrew]], the Omnipotent. The name is a circumlocution, indeed, a too abundant figure ofJewish rhetoric, and has always been denounced by the Occultists. To the Jewish Kabalists, and even the Christian Alchemists andRosicrucians, Jehovah was a convenient screen, unified by the folding of its many flaps, and adopted as a substitute: one name of anindividual Sephiroth being as good as another name, for those who had the secret. The Tetragrammaton, the Ineffable, the sidereal\"Sum Total,\" was invented for no other purpose than to mislead the profane and to symbolize life and generation.* The real secretand unpronounceable name -- \"the word that is no word\" -- has to be sought in the seven names of the first seven emanations, or the\"Sons of the Fire,\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Says the translator of Avicebron's \"Qabbalah\" (Mr. Isaac Myer, LL.B., of Philadelphia) of this \"Sum Total\": \"The letter of Kether is[[hebrew]] (Yod), of Binah [[hebrew]](Heh), together YaH, the feminine Name; the third letter, that of Hokhmah, is [[hebrew]] (Vau),making together, [[hebrew]] YHV of [[hebrew]] YHVH, the Tetragrammaton, and really the complete symbols of its efficaciousness.The last [[hebrew]](Heh) of this Ineffable Name being always applied to the Six Lower and the last, together the Seven remainingSephiroth.\" . . .

This statement holds asgood for the Hebrew or Chaldean Kabala as it does for Genesis, had the latter been ever thoroughly understood, and -- what is stillmore important -- correctly translated.** Everywhere there is either a LOGOS -- a \"Light shining[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The statement will, of course, be found preposterous and absurd, and simply laughed at. But if one believes in the final submersionof Atlantis 850,000 years ago, as taught in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" (the gradual first sinking having begun during the Eocene age), onehas to accept the statement for the so-called Lemuria, the continent of the Third Root Race, first nearly destroyed by combustion, andthen submerged. This is what the Commentary says: \"The first earth having been purified by the forty-nine fires, her people, born ofFire and Water, could not die . . . etc.; the Second Earth (with its race) disappeared as vapour vanishes in the air . . . the Third Earthhad everything consumed on it after the separation, and went down into the lower Deep (the Ocean). This was twice eighty-two cyclicyears ago.\" Now a cyclic year is what we call a sidereal year, and is founded on the precession of the equinoxes, or 25,868 yearseach, and this is equal, therefore, in all to 4,242,352 years. More details will be found in the text of Book II. Meanwhile, this doctrineis embodied in the \"Kings of Edom.\"** The same reserve is found in the Talmud and in every national system of religion whether monotheistic or exotericallypolytheistical. From the superb religious poem by the Kabalist Rabbi Solomon Ben Gabirol in \"the Kether Malchuth,\" we select a fewdefinitions given in the prayers of Kippur. . . . \"Thou art one, the beginning of all numbers, and the foundation of all edifices; Thouart One, and in the secret of Thy unity the wisest of men are lost, because they know it not. Thou art one, and Thy Unity is neverdiminished, never extended, and cannot be changed. Thou art one, but not as an element of numeration; for Thy Unity admits not ofmultiplication, change or form. Thou art existent; but the understanding and vision of mortals cannot attain to thy existence, nordetermine for thee the Where, the How, and the Why.

The Latin Church, paradoxical as ever, whileapplying the epithet of Creator to Jehovah alone, adopts a whole Kyriel of names for the working FORCES of the latter, those namesbetraying the secret. For if the said Forces had nought to do with \"Creation\" so-called, why call them Elohim (Alhim) in plural; \"divineworkmen\" and Energies ([['Energeia]]), incandescent celestial stones (lapides igniti coelorum), and especially, \"supporters of the"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"World\" ([[Kosmokratores]]), governors or RULERS of the World (rectores mundi), the \"Wheels\" of the World (Rotae), Ophanim, Flamesand POWERS, \"Sons of God\" (B'ne Alhim), \"Vigilant COUNSELLORS,\" etc., etc.It was often premised (and as unjustly as usual) that China, nearly as old a country as India, had no cosmogony. \"It was unknown toConfucius, and the Buddhists extended their Cosmogony without introducing a personal God,\"* it is complained. The Yi-King, \"thevery essence of ancient thought and the combined work of the most venerated sages, fails to show a distinct cosmogony.\"Nevertheless, there is one, and a very distinct one. Only as Confucius did not admit of a future life** and the Chinese Buddhists rejectthe idea of One Creator, accepting one cause and its numberless effects, they are misunderstood by the believers in a personal God.The \"great Extreme\" as the commencement \"of changes\" (transmigrations) is the shortest and perhaps the most suggestive of allCosmogonies, for those who, like the Confucianists, love virtue for its own sake, and try to do good unselfishly without perpetuallylooking to reward and profit. The \"great Extreme\" of Confucius produces \"two figures.\" These \"two\" produce in their turn \"the fourimages\"; these again \"the eight symbols.\" It is complained that though the Confucianists see in them \"Heaven, Earth and man inminiature,\" . . . we can see in them anything we like. No doubt, and so it is with regard to many symbols, especially in those of thelatest religions. But they who know something of Occult numerals, see in these \"figures\" the symbol, however rude, of a harmoniousprogressive Evolution of Kosmos and its beings, both the Heavenly and the Terrestrial. And any one who has studied the numericalevolution in the primeval cosmogony of Pythagoras (a contemporary of Confucius) can never fail to find in his Triad, Tetractis and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] a distance between this Kabalistical Deity and the Biblical Jehovah, the spiteful andrevengeful God of Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, who tempted the former and wrestled with the last.

Confucius is laughed at by his Christian biographer for \"talking ofdivination\" before and after this passage, and is represented as saying: \"The eight symbols determine good and ill fortune, and theselead to great deeds. There are no imitable images greater than heaven and earth. There are no changes greater than the fourseasons (meaning North, South, East and West, et seq.). There are no suspended images brighter than the sun and moon. Inpreparing things for use, there is none greater than the sage. In determining good and ill-luck there is nothing greater than thedivining straws and the tortoise.\"*Therefore, the \"divining straws\" and the \"tortoise,\" the \"symbolic sets of lines,\" and the great sage who looks at them as they becomeone and two, and two become four, and four become eight, and the other sets \"three and six,\" are laughed to scorn, only because hiswise symbols are misunderstood.So the author and his colleagues will scoff no doubt at the Stanzas given in our text, for they represent precisely the same idea. Theold archaic map of Cosmogony is full of lines in the Confucian style, of concentric circles and dots. Yet all these represent the mostabstract and philosophical conceptions of the Cosmogony of our Universe. At all events it may answer, perhaps, better to therequirements and the scientific purposes of our age, than the cosmogonical essays of St. Augustine and the \"Venerable Bede,\"though these were published over a millennium later than the Confucian.Confucius, one of the greatest sages of the ancient world, believed in ancient magic, and practised it himself \"if we take for grantedthe statements of Kin-yu\" . . . . and \"he praised it to the skies in Yi-kin,\" we are told by his reverend critic. Nevertheless, even in his age-- i.e., 600 B.C., Confucius and his school taught the sphericity of the Earth and even the heliocentric system; while, at about thrice600 years after the Chinese philosopher, the Popes of Rome threatened and even burnt \"heretics\" for asserting the same. He islaughed at for speaking of the \"Sacred Tortoise.\" No unprejudiced person can see any great difference between a tortoise and a lambas candidates for sacredness, as both are symbols and no more.

As Aben Ezra says: \"Ifthou art capable of comprehending the mystery of Azazel, thou wilt learn the mystery of His (God's) name, for it has similar associatesin Scriptures.

They have all an occult reference toprimordial Cosmic forms and its first concretions, work, and evolution.In the earliest Hindu exoteric cosmogonies, it is not even the Demiurge who creates. For it is said in one of the Puranas that: \"Thegreat Architect of the World gives the first impulse to the rotatory motion of our planetary system by stepping in turn over each planetand body.\" It is this action \"that causes each sphere to turn around itself, and all around the Sun.\" After which action, \"it is theBrahmandica, the Solar and Lunar Pitris (the Dhyani-Chohans)\" who take charge of their respective spheres (earths and planets), tothe end of the Kalpa.\" The Creators are the Rishis; most of whom are credited with the authorship of the mantras or Hymns of the RigVeda. They are sometimes seven, sometimes ten, when they become prajapati, the \"Lord of Beings\"; then they rebecome the sevenand the fourteen Manus, as the representatives of the seven and fourteen cycles of Existence (\"Days of Brahma\"); thus answering tothe seven AEons, when at the end of the first stage of Evolution they are transformed into the seven stellar Rishis, the Saptarishis;while their human doubles appear as heroes, Kings and Sages on this earth.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] when thou shalt have thirty three years of age thou wilt comprehend me.\" So with themystery of the tortoise.

No one ever doubted that the NAME must have been assumed, when under the guise of theInfinite, One Incognizable, the Malachim (messengers) descended to eat and drink with men. But if the Elohim (and even lowerBeings), assuming the god-name, were and are still worshipped, why should the same Elohim be called devils, when appearing underthe names of other Gods?* The choice is curious, and shows how paradoxical were the first Christians in their selections. For why should they have chosen thesesymbols of Egyptian paganism, when the eagle is never mentioned in the New Testament save once, when Jesus refers to it as acarrion eater? (Matt. xxiv. 28); and in the Old Testament it is called unclean; that the Lion is made a point of comparison with Satan,both roaring for men to devour; and the oxen are driven out of the Temple. On the other hand the Serpent, brought as an exemplarof wisdom to follow, is now regarded as the symbol of the Devil. The esoteric pearl of Christ's religion degraded into Christiantheology, may indeed be said to have chosen a strange and unfitting shell to be born in and evolved from.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 443 THE MYSTERY OF BLACKNESS.The Esoteric doctrine of the East having thus furnished and struck the key-note -- which is as scientific as it is philosophical andpoetical, as may be seen, under its allegorical garb -- every nation has followed its lead. It is from the exoteric religions that we haveto dig out the root-idea before we turn to esoteric truths, lest the latter should be rejected. Furthermore, every symbol -- in everynational religion -- may be read esoterically, and the proof furnished for its being correctly read by transliterating it into itscorresponding numerals and geometrical forms -- by the extraordinary agreement of all -- however much the glyphs and symbols mayvary among themselves. For in the origin those symbols were all identical. Take, for instance, the opening sentences in variouscosmogonies: in every case it is either a circle, an egg, or a head. DARKNESS is always associated with this first symbol and surroundsit, -- as shown in the Hindu, the Egyptian, the Chaldeo-Hebrew and even the Scandinavian systems -- hence black ravens, black doves,black waters and even black flames; the seventh tongue of Agni, the fire-god being called \"Kali,\" \"the black,\" as it was a blackflickering flame. Two black doves flew from Egypt and settling on the oaks of Dodona, gave their names to the Grecian gods. Noahlets out a black raven after the deluge, which is a symbol for the Cosmic pralaya, after which began the real creation or evolution ofour earth and humanity. Odin's black ravens fluttered around the Goddess Saga and \"whispered to her of the past and of the future.\"What is the real meaning of all those black birds? They are all connected with the primeval wisdom, which flows out of the pre-cosmicSource of all, symbolised by the Head, the Circle, the Egg; and they all have an identical meaning and relate to the primordialArchetypal man (Adam Kadmon) the creative origin of all things, which is composed of the Host of Cosmic Powers -- the CreativeDhyan-Chohans, beyond which all is darkness.Let us inquire of the wisdom of the Kabala -- even veiled and distorted as it now is, -- to explain in its numerical language anapproximate meaning, at least of the word \"raven.\" This is its number value as given in the \"Source of Measures.\"\"The term Raven is used but once, and taken as eth-h'orebv [[diagram]], = 678, or 113 x 6; while the Dove is mentioned five times.

Six diameters, or the raven, crossing, would divide the circumference of a circle of 355 into 12 parts orcompartments; and 355 subdivided for each unit by 6, would equal 213-0, or the head (\"beginning\") in the first verse of Genesis.

Whatever the many other meanings of this emblematical allegory may be, itschief meaning is that of a new cycle and a new Round (our Fourth Round.)* The \"Raven,\" or the Eth-H'Orebv, yields the samenumerical value as the \"Head,\" and returned not to the ark, while the dove returned, carrying the olive-branch, when Noah, the newman of the new Race (whose prototype is Vaivasvata Manu), prepared to leave the ark, the womb (or Argha) of terrestrial nature, is thesymbol of the purely spiritual, sexless and androgyne man of the first three Races, who vanished from earth for ever. NumericallyJehovah, Adam, Noah, are one in the Kabala: at best, then, it is Deity descending on to Ararat (later on Sinai), to incarnate in manhis image, through the natural process, henceforth: the mother's womb, whose symbols are the ark, the mount (Sinai), etc., in Genesis.The Jewish allegory is at once astronomical, and purely physiological rather than anthropomorphic.And here lies the abyss between the two systems (Aryan and Semitic), though built on the same foundation. As shown by anexpounder of the Kabala, \"the basic idea underlying the philosophy of the Hebrews was that God contained all things within himselfand that man was his image; man, including woman (as Androgynes);\" and that \"geometry and numbers (and measures applicable toastronomy) are contained in the terms man and woman; and the apparent incongruity of such a mode was eliminated by showing theconnection of man and woman with a particular system of numbers and measures and geometry, by the parturient time-periods, whichfurnished the connecting link between the terms and the facts shown, and perfected the mode used.\" It is argued that, the primalcause being absolutely incognizable, \"the symbol of its first comprehensible manifestation was the conception of a circle with itsdiameter line, so as at once to carry the idea of geometry, phallicism, and astronomy;\" and this was finally applied to the\"signification of simply human generative organs.\"** Hence the whole cycle of events[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Bryant is right in saying \"Druid Bardesin says of Noah that when he came out of the ark (the birth of a new cycle), after a stay thereinof a year and a day, that 364 + 1 = 365 days, he was congratulated by Neptune upon his birth from the waters of the Flood, whowished him a happy New Year.\" The \"Year,\" or cycle, esoterically, was the new race of men born from woman after the separation ofthe sexes, which is the secondary meaning of the allegory: its primary meaning being the beginning of the Fourth Round, or the newCreation.** Unpubl.

Hence, too, their genesis begins after their coming out of the Ark, and the close of the flood -- at the FourthRace. With the Aryan people it is different.Eastern Esotericism has never degraded the One Infinite Deity, the container of all things, to such uses; and this is shown by theabsence of Brahma from the Rig Veda and the modest positions occupied therein by Rudra and Vishnu, who became the powerfuland great Gods, the \"Infinites\" of the exoteric creeds, ages later. But even they, \"Creators\" as the three may be, are not the directcreators and \"forefathers of men.\" The latter are shown occupying a still lower scale, and are called Prajapatis, the Pitris (our lunarancestors), etc., etc. -- never the \"One Infinite God.\" Esoteric philosophy shows only physical man as created in the image of the Deity:but the latter is but \"the minor gods.\" It is the HIGHER-SELF, the real EGO who alone is divine and GOD.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 445 GOD IS OUR HIGHER SELF.§ XIII.THE SEVEN CREATIONS.\"THERE was neither day nor night, nor sky nor earth, nor darkness nor light, nor any other thing save only ONE, unapprehensible byintellect, or THAT which is Brahma and Pumis (Spirit) and Pradhana (crude matter)\" (Veda: \"Vishnu Purana Commentary\"); orliterally: \"One Pradhanika Brahma Spirit: THAT was.\" The \"Pradhanika Brahma Spirit\" is Mulaprakriti and Parabrahmam.In Vishnu Purana, Parasara says to Maitreya, his pupil:-- \"I have thus explained to you, excellent Muni, six creations. . . . the creationof the Arvaksrotas beings was the seventh, and was that of man.\" Then he proceeds to speak of two additional and very mysteriouscreations, variously interpreted by the commentators.Origen, commenting upon the books written by Celsus, his opponent -- books which were all destroyed by the prudent Church Fathers -- evidently answers the objections of his contradictor and reveals his system at the same time. This was evidently septenary. But histheogony, the genesis of the stars or planets, that of sound and colour, all found as an answer satire, and no better.

This name (Ar(r)hetos) is one to indicate theSevenfold nature of the One (the logos). \"The goddess Rhea,\" says Proclus in Timaeus (p. 121), \"is a Monad, Duad, and Heptad,\"comprehending in herself all the Titanidae, \"who are seven.\"The Seven Creations are found in almost every Purana. They are all preceded by what Wilson translates -- \"the indiscrete Principle,\"absolute Spirit independent of any relation with objects of sense. They are -- (1) Mahattattwa, the Universal Soul, Infinite Intellect, orDivine Mind; (2) Bhuta or Bhutasarga, elemental creation, the first differentiation of Universal indiscrete Substance; (3) Indriya orAindriyaka, organic evolution. \"These three were the Prakrita creations, the developments of indiscrete nature preceded by indiscreteprinciple\"; (4) Mukhya, the fundamental creation of perceptible things, was that of inanimate bodies**; (5) Tairyagyonya, orTiryaksrotas, was that of animals; (6) Urdhwasrotas, or that of divinities*** (?); (7) Arvaksrotas, was that of man. (See Vishnu Purana.)This is the order given in the exoteric texts. According to esoteric teaching there are seven primary, and seven secondary \"creations;\"the former being the Forces self-evolving from the one causeless FORCE; the latter, showing the manifested Universe emanating fromthe already differentiated divine elements.Esoterically, as well as exoterically, all the above enumerated Creations stand for the (7) periods of Evolution, whether after an \"Age\"or a \"Day\" of Brahma. This is the teaching par excellence of Occult Philosophy, which, however, never uses the term \"creation,\" noreven that of evolution, \"with regard to primary 'Creation':\" but calls all such forces \"the aspects of the Causeless Force.\" In the Bible[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Origen contra Celsum, b. vi., chap. xxii.** The text says: \"And the fourth creation is here the primary, for things immovable are emphatically known as primary.\" (SeeFitzedward Hall's Corrections.)*** How can \"divinities\" have been created after the animals? The esoteric meaning of the expression \"animals\" is the germs of allanimal life including man. Man is called a sacrificial animal, and an animal that is the only one among animal creation whosacrifices to the gods. Moreover, by the \"sacred animals,\" the 12 signs of the zodiac are often meant in the sacred texts, as alreadystated.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 447 THE ORDER OF THE EVOLUTION.the seven periods are dwarfed into the six days of creation and the seventh day of rest, and the Westerns adhere to the letter. In theHindu philosophy, when the active Creator has produced the world of gods, the germs of all the undifferentiated elements and therudiments of future senses (the world of noumena, in short), the Universe remains unaltered for a \"Day of Brahma,\" a period of4,320,000,000 years. This is the seventh passive period or the \"Sabbath day\" of Eastern philosophy, that follows six periods of activeevolution. In the Satapatha Brahmana \"Brahma\" (neuter), the absolute Cause of all Causes, radiates the gods. Having radiated thegods (through its inherent nature) the work is interrupted. In the 1st Book of Manu it is said, \"At the expiration of each night (pralaya)Brahma, having been asleep, awakes, and, through the sole energy of the motion, CAUSES to emanate from itself the spirit, which inits essence is, and yet is not.\"In the Sepher Jezirah, the Kabalistic Book of Creation, the author has evidently repeated the words of Manu. In it the DivineSubstance is represented as having alone existed from the eternity, boundless and absolute; and as having emitted from itself theSpirit. \"One is the Spirit of the living God, blessed be his Name, who liveth for ever! Voice, Spirit, and Word, this is the Holy Spirit.\"(Sepher Jezireh, chap. 1, Mishna IX.) And this is the Kabalistic abstract Trinity, so unceremoniously anthropomorphized by theFathers. From this triple ONE emanated the whole Kosmos. First from ONE emanated number TWO, or Air, the creative element; andthen number THREE, Water, proceeded from the air; Ether or Fire complete the mystic four, the Arba-il. (Ibid.) In the Eastern doctrineFire is the first Element -- Ether, synthesizing the whole (since it contains all of them).In the Vishnu Purana, the whole seven periods are given, and the progressive Evolution of \"Spirit-Soul,\" and of the seven forms ofmatter (or principles) are shown. It is impossible to enumerate them in this work. The reader is asked to peruse one of the Puranas.\"R. Yehudah began, it is written: 'Elohim said: Let there be a firmament, in the midst of waters. . . . . At the time that the Holy . . .created the world, He (they) created seven heavens Above. He created seven earths Below, seven seas, seven days, seven rivers,seven weeks, seven years, seven times, and 7,000 years that the world has been. . . . . the seventh of all the millennium. So here areseven earths Below, they are all inhabited except those which are above, and those . . . . below. And . . . . between each earth, aheaven (firmament) is spread out between each other. . . . . And there are in them (these earths) creatures who look different fromeach other . . . . but if you object and say that all the children of the world came out from Adam,------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 1, Page]] 448 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.it is not so. . . . . And the lower earths, where do they come from? They are from the chain of the earth, and from the heaven below,\"etc., etc.*Irenaeus is our witness (and a very unwilling one, too) that the Gnostics taught the same system, veiling very carefully the true esotericmeaning. This \"veiling,\" however, is identical with that of the Vishnu Purana and others. Thus Irenaeus writes of the Marcosians:\"They maintain that first of all the four elements, fire, water, earth and air, were produced after the image of the primary tetrad above,and that then if we add their operations, namely, heat, cold, dryness and moisture, an exact likeness of the ogdoad is presented.\" (B.i. ch. xvii.)Only this \"likeness\" and the ogdoad itself is a blind, just as in the seven creations of the Vishnu Puranas, to which two more are addedof which the eighth, termed Anugraha, \"possesses both the qualities of goodness and darkness,\" a Sankhyan more than a Puranicidea. For Irenaeus says again (b. I. xxx. 6) that \"they (the Gnostics) had a like eighth creation which was good and bad, divine andhuman. They affirm that man was formed on the eighth day. Sometimes they affirm that he was made on the sixth day, and at otherson the eighth; unless, perchance, they mean that his earthly part was formed on the sixth day and his fleshly part (?) on the eighthday; these two being distinguished by them.\"They were so \"distinguished,\" but not as Irenaeus gives it. The Gnostics had a superior Hebdomad, and an inferior one, in Heaven;and a third terrestrial Hebdomad, on the plane of matter. IAO, the mystery god and the Regent of the Moon, as given in Origen'schart, was the chief of these superior \"Seven Heavens,\"** hence identical with the chief of the lunar Pitris, that name being given bythem to the lunar Dhyan-Chohans. \"They affirm that these seven heavens are intelligent, and speak of them as being angels,\" writesthe same Irenaeus; and adds that on this account they termed Iao Hebdomas, while his mother was called \"Ogdoas,\" because, as heexplains, \"she preserved the number of the first begotten and primary Ogdoad of the Pleroma.\" (Ibid. b. I, v. 2).This \"first begotten Ogdoad\" was (a) in theogony the second Logos (the manifested) because he was born of the Seven-fold firstLogos, hence he is the eighth on this manifested plane; and (b) in astrolatry, it was the Sun, Martanda -- the eighth son of Aditi, whomshe rejects while preserving her Seven Sons, the planets. For the ancients have never regarded the Sun as a planet, but as a centraland fixed Star. This, then, is the second Hebdomad born of the Seven-rayed one, Agni, the Sun[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Qabbalah, p. 415-16, by T. Myer, Philadelphia.** Superior to the Spirits or \"Heavens\" of the Earth only.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 449 THE SIX STELLAR GODS.and what not, only not the seven planets, which are Surya's brothers, not his Sons. These Astral gods, whose chief with the Gnosticswas Ildabaoth* (from Ilda \"child,\" and Baoth \"the egg\"), the son of Sophia Achamoth, the daughter of Sophia (Wisdom), whose regionis the Pleroma, were his (Ildabaoth's) sons. He produces from himself these six stellar spirits: Jove (Jehovah), Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi,Osraios, Astaphaios,** and it is they who are the second, or inferior Hebdomad. As to the third, it is composed of the seven primevalmen, the shadows of the lunar gods, projected by the first Hebdomad. In this the Gnostics did not, as seen, differ much from theesoteric doctrine except that they veiled it. As to the charge made by Irenaeus, who was evidently ignorant of the true tenets of the\"Heretics,\" with regard to man being created on the sixth day, and man being created on the eighth, this relates to the mysteries ofthe inner man. It will become comprehensible to the reader only after he has read Book II., and understood well the Anthropogenesisof the Esoteric doctrine.Ildabaoth is a copy of Manu. The latter boasts, \"Oh, best of twice-born men! Know that I (Manu) am he, the creator of all this world,whom that male Viraj . . . spontaneously produced\" (I., 33). He first creates the ten lords of Being, the Prajapatis, who, as verse 36 says. . . \"produce seven other Manus.\" (The Ordinances of Manu.) Ildabaoth does likewise: \"I am Father and God, and there is no oneabove me,\" he exclaims. For which his mother coolly puts him down by saying, \"Do not lie, Ildabaoth, for the father of all, the firstman (Anthropos) is above thee, and so is Anthropos, the Son of Anthropos\" (Irenaeus, b. I, ch. xxx., 6). This is a good proof that therewere three Logoi (besides the Seven born of the First), one of these being the Solar Logos. And, again, who was that \"Anthropos\"himself, so much higher than Ildabaoth? The Gnostic records alone can solve this riddle. In Pistis Sophia the four-vowelled nameIEOV is in each case accompanied by the epithet of \"the Primal, or First man.\" This shows again that the gnosis was but an echo ofour archaic doctrine. The names answering to Parabrahm, to Brahm, and Manu (the first thinking man) are composed of one-vowelled, three-vowelled and seven-vowelled sounds. Marcus, whose philosophy was certainly more Pythagorean than anything else,speaks of a revelation to him of the seven heavens sounding each one vowel as they pronounced the seven names of the seven(angelic) hierarchies.When spirit has permeated every minutest atom of the seven principles of Kosmos, then the secondary creation, after the above-mentioned period of rest, begins.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Isis Unveiled,\" Vol. II., p. 183."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"** See also King's Gnostics.

They are like the 12,000 divine years of the gods, a cyclicblind. Every \"Day of Brahma\" has 14 Manus, which the Hebrew Kabalists, following, however, in this the Chaldeans, have disguisedinto 12 \"Hours.\"* The Nuctameron of Apollonius of Tyana is the same thing. \"The Dodecahedron lies concealed in the perfect Cube,\"say the Kabalists. The mystic meaning of this is, that the twelve great transformations of Spirit into matter (the 12,000 divine years)take place during the four great ages, or the first Mahayuga. Beginning with the metaphysical and the supra-human, it ends in thephysical and purely human natures of Kosmos and man. Eastern philosophy can give the number of mortal years that run along theline of spiritual and physical evolutions of the seen and the unseen, if Western science fails to do so.Primary Creation is called the Creation of Light (Spirit); and the Secondary -- that of Darkness (matter).** Both are found in Genesis,chap. i., v. 2, and at the beginning of chapter ii. The first is the emanation of self-born gods (Elohim); the second of physical nature.This is why it is said in the Zohar:-- \"Oh, companions, companions, man as emanation was both man and woman; as well on the sideof the FATHER as on the side of the MOTHER. And this is the sense of the words:-- And Elohim spoke: 'Let there be Light and it wasLight!' . . . And this is the 'two-fold man'\" Light, moreover, on our plane, is darkness in the higher spheres.\"Man and woman on the side of the FATHER\" (Spirit) refers to Primary Creation; and on the side of the Mother (matter) to thesecondary. The two-fold man is Adam Kadmon, the male and female abstract prototype and the differentiated Elohim. Man proceedsfrom the Dhyan Chohan, and is a \"Fallen Angel,\" a god in exile, as will be shown.In India these creations were described as follows:--(I.) Mahat-tattwa creation -- so-called because it was the primordial self-evolution of that which had to become Mahat -- the \"divineMIND, conscious and intelligent\"; esoterically, \"the spirit of the Universal soul.\" . . . \"Worthiest of ascetics, through its potency (thepotency of that cause); every produced cause comes by its proper nature.\" (Vishnu Purana.) \"Seeing that the potencies of all beingsare under-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Elsewhere, however, the identity is revealed. See supra, the quotation from Ibn-Gabirol and his 7 heavens, 7 earths, etc.** This must not be confused with precosmic \"DARKNESS,\" the Divine ALL.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 451 MANY VERSIONS OF THE ONE TRUTH.stood only through the knowledge of That (Brahma), which is beyond reasoning, creation, and the like, such potencies are referable toBrahma.\" THAT, then, precedes the manifestation. \"The first was Mahat,\" says Linga Purana; for the ONE (the That) is neither first norlast, but ALL. Exoterically, however, this manifestation is the work of the \"Supreme One\" (a natural effect, rather, of an Eternal Cause);or, as the Commentator says, it might have been understood to mean that Brahma was then created (?), being identified with Mahat,active intelligence or the operating will of the Supreme. Esoteric philosophy renders it \"the operating LAW.\"It is on the right comprehension of this tenet in the Brahmanas and Puranas that hangs, we believe, the apple of discord between thethree Vedantin Sects: the Advaita, Dwaita, and the Visishtadvaitas. The first arguing rightly that Parabrahman, having no relation, asthe absolute all, to the manifested world -- the Infinite having no connection with the finite -- can neither will nor create; that,therefore, Brahma, Mahat, Iswara, or whatever name the creative power may be known by, creative gods and all, are simply anillusive aspect of Parabrahmam in the conception of the conceivers; while the other sects identify the impersonal Cause with theCreator, or Iswara.Mahat (or Maha-Buddhi) is, with the Vaishnavas, however, divine mind in active operation, or, as Anaxagoras has it, \"an ordering anddisposing mind, which was the cause of all things,\" -- [[Nous o diakosmonte kai panton aitios]].Wilson saw at a glance the suggestive connection between Mahat and the Phoenician Mot, or Mut, who was female with theEgyptians -- the Goddess Mout, the \"Mother\" -- \"which, like Mahat,\" he says, \"was the first product of the mixture (?) of Spirit andmatter, and the first rudiment of Creation\": \"Ex connexione autem ejus spiritus prodidit Mot . . . . . From whose seed were created allliving things\" -- repeats Brucker (I., 240) -- giving it a still more materialistic and anthropomorphic colouring.Nevertheless, the esoteric sense of the doctrine is seen through every exoteric sentence on the very face of the old Sanscrit texts thattreat of primordial Creation. \"The Supreme Soul, the all permeant (Sarvaga) Substance of the World, having entered (been drawn)into matter (prakriti) and Spirit (purusha), agitated the mutable and the immutable principles the season of Creation (manvantara)having arrived.\"* . . ."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The nous of the Greeks, which is (spiritual or divine) mind, or mens, \"Mahat,\" operates upon matter in the same way; it \"enters into\"and agitates it:\"Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus,Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.\"In the Phoenician Cosmogony, \"Spirit mixing with its own principles gives rise to [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 452 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Esoteric doctrine teaches that the Dhyan Chohans are the collective aggregate of divine Intelligence or primordial mind, and that thefirst Manus -- the seven \"mind-born\" Spiritual Intelligences -- are identical with the former. Hence the \"Kwan-shi-yin\" -- \"the goldenDragon in whom are the seven,\" of Stanza III. -- is the primordial Logos, or Brahma, the first manifested creative Power; and theDhyani-Energies are the Manus, or Manu-Swayambhuva collectively. The direct connection, moreover, between the \"Manus\" and\"Mahat\" is easy to see. Manu is from the root man, \"to think\"; and thinking proceeds from the mind. It is, in Cosmogony, the pre-nebular period.(II.) \"The second Creation,\" \"Bhuta,\" was of the rudimental principles (Tanmatras), thence termed the elemental creation (Bhuta-sarga).* It is the period of the first breath of the differentiation of the pre-Cosmic Elements or matter. Bhutadi means literally \"theorigin of the Elements,\" and precedes Bhuta-sarga -- the \"creation\" or differentiation of those Elements in primordial \"Akasa\" (Chaosor Vacuity).** In the \"Vishnu Purana\" it is said to proceed along, and belong to, the triple aspect of Ahankara, translated Egotism, butmeaning rather that untranslateable term the \"I-AM-NESS,\" that which first issues from \"Mahat,\" or divine mind; the first shadowyoutline of Self-hood, for \"pure\" Ahankara becomes \"passionate\" and finally \"rudimental\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] creation\" also; (Brucker, I., 240); the Orphic triad shows an identical doctrine: for therePhanes (or Eros), Chaos, containing crude undifferentiated Cosmic matter, and Chronos (time), are the three co-operating principles,emanating from the Unknowable and concealed point, which produce the work of \"Creation.\" And they are the Hindu Purusha(phanes), Pradhana (chaos), and Kala (Chronos) or time. The good Professor Wilson does not like the idea, as no Christian clergyman,however liberal, would. He remarks that \"as presently explained,. the mixture (of the Supreme Spirit or Soul) is not mechanical; it isan influence or effect exerted upon intermediate agents which produce effects.\" The sentence in Vishnu Purana: \"As fragrance affectsthe mind from its proximity merely, and not from any immediate operation upon mind itself, so the Supreme influenced the elementsof creation,\" the reverend and erudite Sanscritist correctly explains . . . : \"As perfumes do not delight the mind by actual contact, butby the impression they make upon the sense of smelling, which communicates it to the mind,\" adding: \"The entrance of the Supremeinto spirit, as well as matter, is less intelligible than the view elsewhere taken of it, as the infusion of spirit, identified with the supreme,into Prakriti or matter alone.\" He prefers the verse in Padma Purana: \"He who is called the male (spirit) of Prakriti . . . that same divineVishnu entered into Prakriti.\" This \"view\" is certainly more akin to the plastic character of certain verses in the Bible concerning thePatriarchs, such as Lot (Gen. xix., 34-38) and even Adam (iv., v. 1), and others of a still more anthropomorphic nature. But it is justthat which led Humanity to Phallicism, Christian religion being honeycombed with it, from the first chapter of Genesis down to theRevelation.* All these sentences are quoted from \"Vishnu Purana,\" Book I., ch. v.** Vishnu is both Bhutesa, \"Lord of the Elements, and all things,\" and Viswarupa, \"Universal Substance or Soul.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 453 THE SEVEN CREATIONS.(initial); it is \"the origin of conscious as of all unconscious being,\" though the Esoteric school rejects the idea of anything being\"unconscious\" -- save on this (our) plane of illusion and ignorance. At this stage of the Second Creation, the second hierarchy of theManus appear, the Dhyan Chohans or Devas, who are the origin of Form (rupa): the Chitrasikhandina (bright-crested) or the Riksha --those Rishis who have become the informing souls of the seven stars (of the Great Bear).* In astronomical and Cosmogonicallanguage this Creation relates to the first stage of Cosmic-life, the Fire-Mist Period after its Chaotic stage,** when atoms issue fromLaya.(III.) The third (the Indriya) was the modified form of Ahankara, the conception of \"I,\" (from \"Aham,\" \"I\") termed the organic Creation,or creation of the senses (Aindriyaka). \"These three were the Prakrita creation, the (discrete) developments of indiscrete naturepreceded by the indiscrete principle.\" \"Preceded by,\" ought to be replaced here with \"beginning by,\" Buddhi; for the latter is neither adiscrete nor an indiscrete quantity, but partakes of the nature of both, in man as in Kosmos: a unit -- a human MONAD on the plane ofillusion -- when once freed from the three forms of Ahankara and liberated from its terrestrial manas, Buddhi becomes truly acontinued quantity, both in duration and extension, because eternal and immortal.

Brahma is very often confused with Brahm, by Wilson, for which he is criticised by his successors.

This reminds one of the answer given by one of Thomas Taylor'sadmirers to those scholars who criticised his translations of Plato. \"Thomas Taylor may have had less knowledge of the Greek than hiscritics have, but he understood Plato far better than they do,\" he said.

This is called \"incongruity\" and \"contradictions\" by the Orientalists.*This \"creation\" of the immortals, the \"Deva-Sarga,\" is the last of the first series, and has a universal reference; namely, to Evolutions ingeneral, not specifically to our Manvantara; but the latter begins with the same over and over again, showing that it refers to severaldistinct Kalpas. For it is said \"at the close of the past (Padma) Kalpa the divine Brahma awoke from his night of sleep and beheld theuniverse void.\" Then Brahma is shown going once more over the \"seven creations\" in the secondary stage of evolution, repeating thefirst three on the objective plane.(IV.) The Mukhya, the Primary as it begins the series of four. Neither the word \"inanimate\" bodies nor yet immovable things, astranslated by Wilson, gives a correct idea of the Sanskrit terms used. Esoteric philosophy is not the only one to reject the idea of anyatom being inorganic, for it is found also in orthodox Hinduism. Moreover, Wilson himself says (in his collected Works, vol. iii., p. 381):\"All the Hindu systems consider vegetable bodies as endowed with life . . . \" Charachara, or the synonymous sthavara and jangama,is, therefore, inaccurately rendered by \"animate and inanimate,\" \"sentient beings,\" and \"unconscious,\" or \"conscious and unconsciousbeings,\" etc., etc. \"Locomotive and fixed\" would be better, since trees are considered to possess souls.\" Mukhya is the \"creation\" ororganic evolution of the vegetable kingdom. In this secondary Period, the three degrees of Elemental or Rudimental Kingdoms areevolved in this world, corresponding inversely in order to the three Prakritic creations during the Primary period of Brahma's activity. Asin that period, in the words of \"Vishnu Purana\": \"The first creation was that of Mahat (Intellect), the second, of Tanmatras (rudimentalprinciples), and the third, that of the senses (Aindriyaka)\"; in this one, the order of the Elemental Forces stands thus: (1) The nascentcentres of Force (intellectual and physical); (2) the rudimental principles -- nerve force, so to say; and (3) nascent apperception, whichis the Mahat of the lower kingdoms, especially developed in the third order of Elementals; these are succeeded by the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The three Creations beginning with Intelligence are elemental, but the six creations which proceed from the series of whichIntellect is the first are the work of Brahma\" (Vayu-Purana). Here \"creations\" mean everywhere stages of Evolution. Mahat, \"Intellect\"or mind (which corresponds with Manas, the former being on the Cosmic, and the latter on the human plane) stands here, too, lowerthan Buddhi or Supra-divine Intelligence. Therefore, when we read in Linga Purana that \"the first Creation was that of Mahat,Intellect being the first in manifestation,\" we must refer that (specified) creation to the first evolution of our system or even our Earth,none of the preceding ones being discussed in the Puranas, but only occasionally hinted at.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 455 CREATIONS CONTINUED.objective kingdom of minerals, in which latter that apperception is entirely latent, to re-develop only in the plants). The mukhya\"Creation,\" then, is the middle point between the three lower and the three higher kingdoms, which represent the seven esoterickingdoms of Kosmos, as of Earth.(V.) The Tiryaksrotas (or Tairyagyonya) creation,* that of the \"(sacred) animals,\" corresponding only on Earth, to the dumb animalcreation. That which is meant by \"animals,\" in primary Creation, is the germ of awakening consciousness or of apperception, thatwhich is faintly traceable in some sensitive plants on Earth and more distinctly in the protistic monera.** On our globe, during the firstround, animal \"creation\" precedes that of man, while the former (or mammal) evolves from the latter in our fourth round -- on thephysical plane: in Round I. the animal atoms are drawn into a cohesion of human physical form; while in Round IV. the reverse occursaccording to magnetic conditions developed during life. And this is metempsychosis (See \"Mineral Monad\" in \"Five Years ofTheosophy,\" p. 276). This fifth stage of evolution, called exoterically \"Creation,\" may be viewed in both the Primary and Secondaryperiods, one as the Spiritual and Cosmic, the other as the material and terrestrial. It is Archibiosis, or life-origination -- \"origination,\" sofar, of course, as the manifestation of life on all the seven planes is concerned. It is at this period of Evolution that the absolutelyeternal universal motion, or vibration, that which is called in Esoteric language \"the GREAT BREATH,\" differentiates in the"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"primordial, first manifested ATOM. More and more, as chemical and physical sciences progress, does this occult axiom find itscorroboration in the world of knowledge: the scientific hypothesis, that even the simplest elements of matter are identical in natureand differ from each other only owing to the variety of the distributions of atoms in the molecule or speck of substance, or by themodes of its atomic vibration, gains every day more ground.Thus, as the differentiation of the primordial germ of life has to precede the evolution of the Dhyan Chohan of the third group orhierarchy of Being in Primary Creation, before those \"gods\" can become rupa (embodied in their first ethereal form), so animalcreation has to precede,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Professor Wilson translates it, as though animals were higher on the scale of \"creation\" than divinities, or angels, although the truthabout the devas is very plainly stated further on. This \"creation,\" says the text, is both primary (Prakrita) and secondary (Vaikrita). It isthe latter, as regards the origin of the gods from Brahma (the personal anthropomorphic creator of our material universe); it is theformer (primary) as affecting Rudra, who is the immediate production of the first principle. Rudra is not alone a title of Siva, butembraces agents of creation, angels and men, as will be shown further on.** Neither plant nor animal, but an existence between the two.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 456 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.for that same reason, divine MAN on earth. And this is why we find in the Puranas: \"The fifth, the Tairyagyonya creation, was that ofanimals, and --(VI). The Urdhvasrotas creation, or that of divinities (Vishnu Purana Book I. chap. i.). But these (divinities) are simply the prototypes ofthe First Race, the fathers of their \"mind-born\" progeny with the soft bones.* It is these who became the Evolvers of the \"Sweat-born\" --an expression explained in Book II. Finally, the sixth \"Creation\" is followed, and \"Creation in general, closed by --(VII.) The evolution of the \"Arvaksrotas beings, which was the seventh, and was that of man\" (Vishnu Purana, Book I.).The \"eighth creation\" mentioned is no Creation at all; it is a blind again, for it refers to a purely mental process: the cognition of the\"ninth\" creation, which, in its turn, is an effect, manifesting in the secondary of that which was a \"Creation\" in the Primary (Prakrita)Creation.** The Eighth, then, called Anugraha (the Pratyayasarga or the intellectual creation of the Sankhyas, explained in Karika, v.46, p. 146), is \"that creation of which we have a perception\" -- in its esoteric aspect -- and \"to which we give intellectual assent(Anugraha) in contradistinction to organic creation.\" It is the correct perception of our relations to the whole range of \"gods\" andespecially of those we bear to the Kumaras -- the so-called \"Ninth Creation\" -- which is in reality an aspect of or reflection of the sixthin our manvantara (the Vaivasvata). \"There is a ninth, the Kumara Creation, which is both primary and secondary,\" says VishnuPurana, the oldest of such texts.*** \"The Kumaras,\" explains an esoteric text,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Created beings\" -- explains Vishnu Purana -- \"although they are destroyed (in their individual forms) at the periods of dissolution,yet being affected by the good or evil acts of former existences, are never exempted from their consequences. And when Brahmaproduces the world anew, they are the progeny of his will . . .\" \"Collecting his mind into itself (Yoga willing), Brahma creates the fourorders of beings, termed gods, demons, progenitors, and MEN\" . . . \"progenitors\" meaning the prototypes and Evolvers of the first RootRace of men. The progenitors are the Pitris, and are of seven classes. They are said in exoteric mythology to be born of Brahma'sside, like Eve from the rib of Adam.** \"These notions,\" remarks Dr. Wilson, \"the birth of Rudra and the saints, seem to have been borrowed from the Saivas, and to havebeen awkwardly engrafted upon the Vaishnava system.\" The esoteric meaning ought to have been consulted before venturing such ahypothesis.*** Parasara, the Vedic Rishi, who received the Vishnu Purana from Pulastya and taught it to Maitreya, is placed by the Orientalists atvarious epochs. As correctly observed, in the Hindu Class. Dict:-- \"Speculations as to his era differ widely from 575 B.C. to 1391 B.C.,and cannot be trusted.\" Quite so; but no less, however, than any other date as assigned by the Sanskritists, so famous in thisdepartment of arbitrary fancy.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 457 WHO THE KUMARAS ARE.\"are the Dhyanis, derived immediately from the supreme Principle, who reappear in the Vaivasvata Manu period, for the progress ofmankind.\"* The commentator of the Vishnu Purana corroborates it, by remarking that \"these sages live as long as Brahma; and theyare only created by him in the first Kalpa, although their generation is very commonly and inconsistently introduced in the Varaha, orPadma Kalpa\" (the secondary). Thus, the Kumaras are, exoterically, \"the creation of Rudra or Nilalohita, a form of Siva, by Brahma,and of certain other mind-born sons of Brahma. But, in the esoteric teaching, they are the progenitors of the true spiritual SELF in thephysical man -- the higher Prajapati, while the Pitris, or lower Prajapati, are no more than the fathers of the model, or type of his"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"physical form, made \"in their image.\" Four (and occasionally five) are mentioned freely in the exoteric texts, three Kumaras beingsecret.** (Compare what is said of \"The Fallen Angels\" in Book II.).The Exoteric four are: Sanat-Kumara, Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanatana; and the esoteric three are: Sana, Kapila, and Sanat-sujata.Special attention is once more drawn to this class of Dhyan Chohans, for herein lies the mystery of generation and heredity hinted atin Book I. (See the four Orders of Angelic Beings; Comment on Stanza VII.). Book II. explains their position in the divine Hierarchy.Meanwhile, let us see what the exoteric texts say about them.They do not say much; nothing to him who fails to read between the lines. \"We must have recourse, here, to other Puranas for theelucidation of this term,\" remarks Wilson, who does not suspect for one moment that he is in the presence of the \"Angels of Darkness,\"the mythical \"great enemy\" of his Church. Therefore, he contrives to elucidate no more than that these (divinities) DECLINING TOCREATE PROGENY*** (and thus rebelling against Brahma), remained, as the name[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* They may indeed mark a \"special\" or extra creation, since it is they who, by incarnating themselves within the senseless humanshells of the two first Root-races, and a great portion of the Third Root-race -- create, so to speak, a new race: that of thinking, self-conscious and divine men.** \"The four Kumaras (are) the mind-born Sons of Brahma. Some specify seven\" (H. Class. Dict.). All these seven Vaidhatra, thepatronymic of the Kumaras, \"the Maker's Sons,\" are mentioned and described in Iswara Krishna's \"Sankhya Karika\" with theCommentary of Gaudapadacharya (Sankaracharya's Paraguru) attached to it. It discusses the nature of the Kumaras, though it refrainsfrom mentioning by name all the seven Kumaras, but calls them instead \"the seven sons of Brahma,\" which they are, as they arecreated by Brahma in Rudra. The list of names it gives us is: Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, Kapila, Ribhu, and Panchasikha. Butthese are again all aliases.*** So untrustworthy are some translations of the Orientalists that in the French Translation of Hari-Vamsa, it is said \"The sevenPrajapati, Rudra, Skanda (his son) [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 458 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of the first implies, ever boys, Kumaras: that is, ever pure and innocent, whence their creation is also called the \"Kumara.\" (Book I.chap. v., Vishnu Purana.) The Puranas, however, may afford a little more light. \"Being ever as he was born, he is here called a youth;and hence his name is well known as Sanat-Kumara\" (Linga purana, prior section LXX. 174.) In the Saiva Purana, the Kumaras arealways described as Yogins. The Kurma Purana, after enumerating them, says: \"These five, O Brahmans, were Yogins, who acquiredentire exemption from passion.\" They are five, because two of the Kumaras fell.Of all the seven great divisions of Dhyan-Chohans, or Devas, there is none with which humanity is more concerned than with theKumaras. Imprudent are the Christian Theologians who have degraded them into fallen Angels, and now call them \"Satan\" andDemons; as among these heavenly denizens who refuse to create, the Archangel Michael -- the greatest patron Saint of Western andEastern Churches, under his double name of St. Michael and his supposed copy on earth, St. George conquering the DRAGON -- hasto be allowed one of the most prominent places. (See Book II., \"The Sacred Dragons and their Slayers.\")The Kumaras, the \"mind-born Sons\" of Brahma-Rudra (or Siva)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] and Sanat-Kumara proceeded to create beings.\" Whereas, as Wilson shows, the original is:\"These seven . . . created progeny; and so did Rudra, but Skanda and Sanat Kumara, restraining their power, abstained fromcreation.\" The \"four orders of beings\" are referred to sometimes as \"Ambhamsi,\" which Wilson renders: \"literally Waters,\" and believesit \"a mystic term.\" It is one, no doubt; but he evidently failed to catch the real esoteric meaning. \"Waters\" and \"water\" stand as thesymbol for Akasa, the \"primordial Ocean of Space,\" on which Narayana, the self-born Spirit, moves: reclining on that which is itsprogeny (See Manu). \"Water is the body of Nara; thus we have heard the name of water explained. Since Brahma rests on the water,therefore he is termed Narayana\" (Linga, Vayu, and Markandeya Puranas) \". . . Pure, Purusha created the Waters pure . . .\" at thesame time Water is the third principle in material Kosmos, and the third in the realm of the Spiritual: Spirit of Fire, Flame, Akasa,Ether, Water, Air, Earth, are the cosmic, sidereal, psychic, spiritual and mystic principles, pre-eminently occult, in every plane ofbeing. \"Gods, Demons, Pitris and men,\" are the four orders of beings to whom the term Ambhamsi is applied (in the Vedas it is asynonym of gods): because they are all the product of WATERS (mystically), of the Akasic Ocean, and of the Third Principle in nature.Pitris and men on earth are the transformations (rebirths) of gods and demons (Spirits) on a higher plane. Water is, in another sense,the feminine principle. Venus Aphrodite is the personified Sea, and the mother of the god of love, the generator of all the gods asmuch as the Christian Virgin Mary is Mare (the sea), the mother of the Western God of Love, Mercy and Charity. If the student ofEsoteric philosophy thinks deeply over the subject he is sure to find out all the suggestiveness of the term Ambhamsi, in its manifoldrelations to the Virgin in Heaven, to the Celestial Virgin of the Alchemists, and even to the \"Waters of Grace\" of the modern Baptist.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 459 THE PATRON-GUIDE OF ISRAEL."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"the howling and terrific destroyer of human passions and physical senses, which are ever in the way of the development of the higherspiritual perceptions and the growth of the inner eternal man -- mystically,* are the progeny of Siva, the Mahayogi, the great patron ofall the Yogis and mystics of India. They themselves, being the \"Virgin-Ascetics,\" refuse to create the material being MAN. Well maythey be suspected of a direct connection with the Christian Archangel Michael, the \"Virgin Combatant\" of the Dragon Apophis, whosevictim is every soul united too loosely to its immortal Spirit, the Angel who, as shown by the Gnostics, refused to create just as theKumaras did.

Every Kumara bears the prefix of Sanat and Sana; andSanaischara is Saturn, the planet (Sani and Sarra), the King Saturn whose Secretary in Egypt was Thot-Hermes the first. They are thusidentified both with the planet and the god (Siva), who are, in their turn, shown the prototypes of Saturn, who is the same as Bel,Baal, Siva, and Jehovah Sabbaoth, The angel of whose face is MIKAEL ([[diagram]] \"who is as God\"). He is the patron, and guardianAngel of the Jews, as Daniel tells us (v. 21); and, before the Kumaras were degraded, by those who were ignorant of their very name,into demons and fallen angels, the Greek Ophites, the occultly inclined predecessors and precursors of the Roman Catholic Churchafter its secession and separation from the primitive Greek Church, had identified Michael with their Ophiomorphos, the rebelliousand opposing spirit. This means nothing more than the reverse aspect (symbolically) of Ophis -- divine Wisdom or Christos.

Because the\"Waters\" is another name of the \"Great Deep,\" the primordial Waters of space or Chaos, and also means \"Mother,\" Amba, meaningAditi and Akasa, the Celestial Virgin-Mother of the visible universe. Furthermore, the \"Waters of the flood\" are also called \"the GREATDRAGON,\" or Ophis, Ophio-Morphos.The Rudras will be noticed in their Septenary character of \"Fire-Spirits\" in the \"Symbolism\" attached to the Stanzas in Book II. Therewe shall also consider the Cross (3 + 4) under its primeval and later forms, and shall use for purposes of comparison the Pythagoreannumbers side by side with Hebrew Metrology. The immense importance of the number seven will thus become evident, as the rootnumber of nature. We shall examine it from the standpoints of the Vedas and the Chaldean Scriptures, as it existed in Egyptthousands of years B.C., and as treated in the Gnostic records; we shall show how its importance as a basic number has gainedrecognition in physical Science; and we shall endeavour to prove that the importance attached to the number seven throughout allantiquity was due to no fanciful imaginings of uneducated priests, but to a profound knowledge of natural law.--------------§ XIV.THE FOUR ELEMENTS.METAPHYSICALLY and esoterically there is but One ELEMENT in nature, and at the root of it is the Deity; and the so-called sevenelements, of which five have already manifested and asserted their existence, are the garment, the veil, of that deity; direct from theessence whereof comes MAN, whether physically, psychically, mentally or spiritually considered. Four elements only are generallyspoken of in later antiquity, five admitted only in philosophy. For the body of ether is not fully manifested yet, and its noumenon isstill \"the Omnipotent Father -- AEther, the synthesis of the rest.\" But what are these \"ELEMENTS\" whose compound bodies have nowbeen discovered by Chemistry and Physics to contain numberless sub-elements, even the sixty or seventy of which no longer embracethe whole number suspected. (Vide Addenda, §§ XI. and XII., quotations from Mr. Crookes' Lectures.) Let us follow their evolutionfrom the historical beginnings, at any rate.The four Elements were fully characterized by Plato when he said that they were that \"which composes and decomposes thecompound bodies.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 461 ON THE ELEMENTS.Hence Cosmolatry was never, even in its worst aspect, the fetishism which adores or worships the passive external form and matter ofany object, but looked ever to the noumenon therein. Fire, Air, Water, Earth, were but the visible garb, the symbols of the informing,invisible Souls or Spirits -- the Cosmic gods to whom worship was offered by the ignorant, and simple, respectful recognition by the"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"wiser. In their turn the phenomenal subdivisions of the noumenal Elements were informed by the Elementals, so called, the \"NatureSpirits\" of lower grades.In the Theogony of Mochus, we find Ether first, and then the air; the two principles from which Ulom the intelligible ([[noetos]]) God(the visible universe of matter) is born.*In the Orphic hymns, the Eros-Phanes evolves from the Spiritual Egg, which the AEthereal winds impregnate, Wind being \"the Spiritof God,\" who is said to move in AEther, \"brooding over the chaos\" -- the Divine \"Idea.\" In the Hindu Katakopanisad, Purusha, theDivine Spirit, already stands before the original matter, from whose union springs the great Soul of the World, \"Maha = Atma, Brahm,the Spirit of Life;\"** these latter appellations being again identical with the Universal Soul, or Anima Mundi, the Astral Light of theTheurgists and Kabalists, being its last and lowest division.\"The [[stoicheia]], (Elements) of Plato and Aristotle, were thus the incorporeal principles attached to the four great divisions of ourCosmic World, and it is with justice that Creuzer defines those primitive beliefs . . . as a species of magism, a psychic paganism, and adeification of potencies; a spiritualization which placed the believers in a close community with these potencies,\" (Book IX, p. 850).So close, indeed, that the hierarchies of those potencies or Forces have been classified on a graduated scale of seven from theponderable to the imponderable. They are Septenary, -- not as an artificial aid to facilitate their comprehension -- but in their realCosmic gradation, from their chemical (or physical) to their purely spiritual composition. Gods -- with the ignorant masses -- godsindependent and supreme; daemons with the fanatics, who, intellectual as they often may be, are unable to understand the Spirit ofthe philosophical sentence, in pluribus unum. With the hermetic philosopher they are FORCES relatively \"blind,\" or \"intelligent,\"according to which of the principles in them he deals with. It required long millenniums before they found themselves, in our culturedage, finally degraded into simple chemical elements.At any rate, good Christians, and especially the Biblical Protestants,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Movers: \"Phoinizer,\" 282.** Weber: \"Akad. Vorles,\" 213, 214, etc.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 462 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.ought to show more reverence for the four Elements, if they would show any for Moses. For the Bible manifests the consideration andmystic significance in which they were held by the Hebrew Lawgiver, on every page of the Pentateuch. The tent which contained theHoly of Holies \" was a Cosmic Symbol, sacred, in one of its meanings, to the Elements, the four cardinal points, and ETHER.Josephus shows it built in white, the colour of Ether. And this explains also why, in the Egyptian and the Hebrew temples -- accordingto Clemens Alexandrinus -- a gigantic curtain, supported by five pillars, separated the sanctum sanctorum (now represented by thealtar in Christian churches) wherein the priests alone were permitted to enter, from the part accessible to the profane. By its fourcolours the curtain symbolized the four principal Elements, and signified the knowledge of the divine that the five senses of men canenable man to acquire with the help of the four Elements. (See Stromata I., v. § 6).In Cory's Ancient Fragments, one of the \"Chaldean Oracles\" expresses ideas about the elements and Ether in language singularly likethat of the Unseen Universe, written by two eminent scientists of our day.It states that \"from ether have come all things, and to it all will return; that the images of all things are indelibly impressed upon it;and that it is the store-house of the germs or of the remains of all visible forms, and even ideas. It appears as if this case strangelycorroborates our assertion that whatever discoveries may be made in our days will be found to have been anticipated by manythousand years by our 'simple-minded ancestors.' \" -- (Isis Unveiled.)Whence came the four elements and the malachim of the Hebrews? They have been made to merge, by a theological sleight-of-hand on the part of the Rabbins and the later Fathers of the Church into Jehovah, but their origin is identical with that of the Cosmicgods of all other nations. Their symbols, whether born on the shores of the Oxus, on the burning sands of Upper Egypt, or in the wildforests, weird and glacial, which cover the slopes and peaks of the sacred snowy mountains of Thessaly, or again, in the pampas ofAmerica, their symbols, we repeat, when traced to their source, are ever one and the same. Whether Egyptian or Pelasgian, Aryan orSemitic, the genius loci, the local god, embraced in its unity all nature; but not especially the four elements any more than one oftheir creations, such as trees, rivers, mounts or stars. The genius loci -- a very late after-thought of the last sub-races of the Fifth Root-race, when the primitive and grandiose meaning had become nearly lost -- was ever the representative in his accumulated titles of allhis colleagues. It was the god of fire, symbolised by thunder, as Jove or Agni; the god of water, symbolised by the fluvial bull or somesacred river or fountain, as Varuna, Neptune, etc.; the god of air, manifesting in the hurricane and tempest, as Vayu and Indra; andthe god or spirit------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 463 THE COSMIC GODS.of the earth, who appeared in earthquakes, like Pluto, Yama, and so many others."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"These were the Cosmic gods, ever synthesizing all in one, as found in every cosmogony or mythology. Thus, the Greeks had theirDodonean Jupiter, who included in himself the four elements and the four cardinal points, and who was recognized, therefore, in oldRome under the pantheistic title of Jupiter Mundus; and who now, in modern Rome, has become the Deus Mundus, the onemundane god, who is made to swallow all others in the latest theology -- by the arbitrary decision of his special ministers.As gods of Fire, Air, Water, they were celestial gods; as gods of the lower region, they were infernal deities: the latter adjectiveapplying simply to the Earth. They were \"Spirits of the Earth\" under their respective names of Yama, Pluto, Osiris, the \"Lord of thelower kingdom, etc., etc.,\" and their tellurial character proves it sufficiently.* The ancients knew of no worse abode after death thanthe Kamaloka, the limbus on this Earth. If it is argued that the Dodonean Jupiter was identified with Aidoneus, the king of thesubterranean world, and Dis, or the Roman Pluto and the Dionysius Chthonios, the subterranean, wherein, according to Creuzer (I, vi.,ch. 1), oracles were rendered, then it will become the pleasure of the Occultists to prove that both Aidoneus and Dionysius are thebases of Adonai, or \"Jurbo Adonai,\" as Jehovah is called in Codex Nazaraeus. \"Thou shalt not worship the Sun, who is namedAdonai, whose name is also Kadush and El-El\" (Cod. Naz., I, 47; see also Psalm lxxxix., 18), and also \"Lord Bacchus.\" Baal-Adonis ofthe Sods or Mysteries of the pre-Babylonian Jews became the Adonai by the Massorah, the later-vowelled Jehovah. Hence theRoman Catholics are right. All these Jupiters are of the same family; but Jehovah has to be included therein to make it complete.Jupiter-Aerios or Pan, the Jupiter Ammon, and the Jupiter-Bel-Moloch, are all correlations and one with Yurbo-Adonai, because theyare all one cosmic nature. It is that nature and power which create the specific terrestrial symbol, and the physical and material fabricof the latter, which proves the Energy manifesting through it as extrinsic.For primitive religion was something better than simple pre-occupation about physical phenomena, as remarked by Schilling; andprinciples, more elevated than we modern Sadducees know of, \"were hidden under the transparent veil of such merely naturaldivinities as thunder,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Gehenna of the Bible was a valley near Jerusalem, where the monotheistic Jews immolated their children to Moloch, if theprophet Jeremiah is to be believed on his word.

While passing power over the fire toHephaistos-Vulcan, over the sea, to Poseidon-Neptune, and over the Earth, to Pluto-Aidoneus -- the AERIAL Jove was all these; forAETHER, from the first, had pre-eminence over, and was the synthesis of, all the elements.Tradition points to a grotto, a vast cave in the deserts of Central Asia, whereinto light pours through its four seemingly naturalapertures or clefts placed crossways at the four cardinal points of the place. From noon till an hour before sunset that light streams in,of four different colours, as averred -- red, blue, orange-gold, and white -- owing to some either natural or artificially preparedconditions of vegetation and soil. The light converges in the centre around a pillar of white marble with a globe upon it, whichrepresents our earth. It is named the \"grotto of Zaratushta.\"When included under the arts and sciences of the fourth race, the Atlanteans, the phenomenal manifestation of the four elements,justly attributed by the believers in Cosmic gods to the intelligent interference of the latter, assumed a scientific character. The magicof the ancient priests consisted, in those days, in addressing their gods in their own language. \"The speech of the men of the earthcannot reach the Lords. Each must be addressed in the language of his respective element\" -- is a sentence which will be shownpregnant with meaning. \"The Book of Rules\" cited adds as an explanation of the nature of that Element-language: \"It is composed ofsounds, not words; of sounds, numbers and figures. He who knows how to blend the three, will call forth the response of thesuperintending Power\" (the regent-god of the specific element needed).Thus this \"language\" is that of incantations or of MANTRAS, as they are called in India, sound being the most potent and effectualmagic agent, and the first of the keys which opens the door of communication between Mortals and the Immortals. He who believes inthe words and teachings of St. Paul, has no right to pick out from the latter those sentences only that he chooses to accept, to therejection of others; and St. Paul teaches most undeniably the existence of cosmic gods and their presence among us. Paganismpreached a dual and simultaneous evolution: \"creation\" -- \"spiritualem ac mundanum,\" as the Roman Church has it -- ages before theadvent of that Roman Church.

For when Plato put in the mouth of the Highest Principle -- \"FatherAEther\" or Jupiter -- these words, for instance: \"The gods of the gods of whom I am the maker (opifex) as I am the father of all theirworks (operumque parens)\"; he knew the spirit of this sentence as fully, we suspect, as St. Paul did, when saying: \"For though there be"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there be gods many and lords many,\" . . . . etc. (1 Cor. viii. 5.)* Both knew thesense and the meaning of what they put forward in such guarded terms.Says Sir W. Grove, F.R.S., speaking of the correlation of forces, \"The ancients when they witnessed a natural phenomenon, removedfrom ordinary analogies, and unexplained by any mechanical action known to them, referred it to a soul, a spiritual or preternaturalpower. . . . Air and gases were also at first deemed spiritual, but subsequently they became invested with a more material character;and the same words [[pneuma]], spirit, etc., were used to signify the soul or a gas; the very word gas, from geist, a ghost or spirit,affords us an instance of the gradual transmutation of a spiritual into a physical conception . . . . . .\" (P. 89.) This, the great man ofscience (in his preface to the fifth edition of \"Correlation of Physical Forces\") considers as the only concern of exact science, which hasno business to meddle with the CAUSES. \"Cause and effect,\" he explains, \"are therefore, in their abstract relation to these forces,words solely of convenience. We are totally unacquainted with the ultimate generating power of each and all of them, and probablyshall ever remain so; we can only ascertain the norma of their actions; we must humbly refer their causation to one omnipresentinfluence, and content ourselves with studying their effects and developing, by experiment, their mutual relations\" (p. xiv.).This policy once accepted, and the system virtually admitted in the above-quoted words, namely, the spirituality of the \"ultimategenerating power,\" it would be more than illogical to refuse to recognise this quality which is inherent in the material elements, orrather, in their com-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We cannot be taken to task by the Protestants for interpreting the verse from the Corinthians as we do; for, if the translation in theEnglish Bible is made ambiguous, it is not so in the original texts, and the Roman Catholic Church accepts the words of the Apostle intheir true sense. For a proof see the Commentaries on St. Paul's Epistles, by St. John Chrysostom \"directly inspired by the Apostle,\"and \"who wrote under his dictation,\" as we are assured by the Marquis de Mirville, whose works are approved by Rome. And St.Chrysostom says, commenting on that special verse, \"And, though there are (in fact) they who are called gods . . . . -- for it seems,there are really several gods -- withal, and for all that, the God-principle and the Superior God ceasing to remain essentially one andindivisible.\" . . . Thus spoke the old Initiates also, knowing that the worship of minor gods could never affect the \"God Principle\" (Seede Mirville, \"Des Esprits,\" vol. ii., 322).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 466 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.pounds -- as present in the fire, air, water or earth. The ancients knew these powers so well, that, while concealing their true natureunder various allegories, for the benefit (or to the detriment) of the uneducated rabble, they never departed from the multiple objectin view, while inverting them. They contrived to throw a thick veil over the nucleus of truth concealed by the symbol, but they evertried to preserve the latter as a record for future generations, sufficiently transparent to allow their wise men to discern that truthbehind the fabulous form of the glyph or allegory. They are accused of superstition and credulity, those ancient sages; and this bythose very nations, which, learned in all the modern arts and sciences, cultured and wise in their generation, accept to this day astheir one living and infinite God, the anthropomorphic \"Jehovah\" of the Jews.What were some of the alleged \"superstitions\"? Hesiod believed, for instance, that \"the winds were the sons of the giant Typhoeus,\"who were chained and unchained at will by AEolus, and the polytheistic Greeks accepted it along with Hesiod. Why should not they,since the monotheistic Jews had the same beliefs, with other names for their dramatis personae, and since Christians believe in thesame to this day? The Hesiodic AEolus, Boreas, etc., etc., were named Kadim, Tzaphon, Daren, and Ruach Hajan by the \"chosenpeople\" of Israel. What is, then, the fundamental difference? While the Hellenes were taught that AEolus tied and untied the winds,the Jews believed as fervently that their Lord God, \"with smoke coming out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth, rode upon acherub and did fly; and was seen upon the wings of the wind\" (II. Sam., xxii. 9 and 11). The expressions of the two nations are eitherboth figures of speech, or both superstitions. We think they are neither; but only arise from a keen sense of oneness with nature, and aperception of the mysterious and the intelligent behind every natural phenomenon, which the moderns no longer possess. Nor was it\"superstitious\" in the Greek pagans to listen to the oracle of Delphi, when, at the approach of the fleet of Xerxes, that oracle advisedthem to \"sacrifice to the Winds,\" if the same has to be regarded as Divine Worship in the Israelites, who sacrificed as often to the windand fire -- especially to the latter element. Do they not say that their \"God is a consuming fire\" (Deut. iv., 24), who appeared generallyas Fire and \"encompassed by fire\"? and did not Elijah seek for him (the Lord) in the \"great strong wind, and in the earthquake\"? Donot the Christians repeat the same after them? Do not they, moreover, sacrifice to this day, to the same \"God of Wind and Water?\"They do; because special prayers for rain, dry weather, trade-winds and the calming of storms on the seas exist to this hour in theprayer-books of the three Christian churches; and the several hundred sects of the Protestant religion------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 467 THE FIGHTING GODS.offer them to their God upon every threat of calamity? The fact that they are no more answered by Jehovah, than they were,probably, by Jupiter Pluvius, does not alter the fact of these prayers being addressed to the Power or Powers supposed to rule over theElements, or of these Powers being identical in Paganism and Christianity; or have we to believe that such prayers are crass idolatryand absurd \"superstition\" only when addressed by a Pagan to his idol, and that the same superstition is suddenly transformed intopraiseworthy piety and religion whenever the name of the celestial addressee is changed? But the tree is known by its fruit. And thefruit of the Christian tree being no better than that of the tree of Paganism, why should the former command more reverence than thelatter."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Thus, when we are told by the Chevalier Drach, a converted Jew, and the Marquis de Mirville, a Roman Catholic fanatic of the Frencharistocracy, that in Hebrew lightning is a synonym of fury, and is always handled by an evil Spirit; that Jupiter Fulgur or Fulgurans isalso called by the Christians oelicius, and denounced as the soul of lightning, its daemon*; we have either to apply the sameexplanation and definitions to the \"Lord God of Israel,\" under the same circumstances, or renounce our right of abusing the gods andcreeds of other nations.The foregoing statements emanating as they do from two ardent and learned Roman Catholics, are, to say the least, dangerous, inthe presence of the Bible and its prophets. Indeed, if Jupiter, the \"chief Daemon of the Pagan Greeks,\" hurled his deadly thunder-bolts and lightnings at those who excited his wrath, so did the Lord God of Abraham and Jacob. We find in I. Samuel, that \"the Lordthundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice, and he sent out arrows (thunder bolts) and scattered them (Saul's armies)with lightning, and discomforted them.\" (Chap. xxii. 14, 15.)The Athenians are accused of having sacrificed to Boreas; and this \"Demon\" is charged with having submerged and wrecked 400ships of the Persian fleet on the rocks of Mount Pelion, and of having become so furious \"that all the Magi of Xerxes could hardlycounteract it by offering contra-sacrifices to Tethys\" [Herodotus \"Polym.\" cxc]. Very fortunately, no authenticated instance is on therecords of Christian wars showing a like catastrophe on the same scale happening to one Christian fleet owing to the \"prayers\" of itsenemy -- another Christian nation. But this is from no fault of theirs, for each prays as ardently to Jehovah for the destruction of theother, as the Athenians prayed to Boreas. Both resorted to a neat little piece of black magic con amore. Such abstinence from divineinterference being hardly due to lack of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Cosmolatry, p. 415.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 468 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.prayers, sent to a common Almighty God for mutual destruction, where, then, shall we draw the line between Pagan and Christian?And who can doubt that all Protestant England would rejoice and offer thanks to the Lord, if, during some future war, 400 ships of thehostile fleet were to be wrecked owing to such holy prayers. What is, then, the difference, we ask again, between a Jupiter, a Boreas,and a Jehovah? No more than this: The crime of one's own next-of-kin -- say of one's \"father\" -- is always excused and often exalted,whereas the crime of our neighbour's parent is ever gladly punished by hanging. Yet the crime is the same.So far the \"blessings of Christianity\" do not seem to have made any appreciable advance on the morals of the converted Pagans.The above is not a defence of Pagan gods, nor is it an attack on the Christian deity, nor does it mean belief in either. The writer isquite impartial, and rejects the testimony in favour of either, neither praying to, believing in, nor dreading any such \"personal\" andanthropomorphic God. The parallels are brought forward simply as one more curious exhibition of the illogical and blind fanaticism ofthe civilized theologian. For, so far, there is not a very great difference between the two beliefs, and there is none in their respectiveeffects upon morality, or spiritual nature. The \"light of Christ\" shines upon as hideous features of the animal-man now, as the \"light ofLucifer\" did in days of old.\"Those unfortunate heathens in their superstition regard even the Elements as something that has comprehension! . . . .

In reply to this, we may quote from Luke viii., 24: \"And he (Jesus) arose and rebuked the Wind and the raging of the Water,and they ceased and there was a calm.\" And here is another quotation from a prayer book: . . . \"Oh, Virgin of the Sea, blessed Motherand Lady of the Waters, stay thy waves . . .\" etc., etc. (prayer of the Neapolitan and Provencal sailors, copied textually from that of thePhoenician mariners to their Virgingoddess Astarte.) The logical and irrepressible conclusion arising from the parallels broughtforward, and the denunciation of the Missionary is this: The commands of the Brahmins to their element-gods not remaining\"ineffectual,\" the power of the Brahmins is thus placed on a par with that of Jesus. Moreover, Astarte is shown not a whit weaker inpotency than the \"Virgin of the Sea\" of Christian sailors.

And once the Christians are shown as immoral and wicked as thepagans ever were, what benefit has humanity derived from its change of gods and idols?That, however, which God and the Christian Saints are justified in doing, becomes a crime, if successful, in simple mortals. Sorceryand incantations are regarded as fables now; yet from the day of the Institutes of Justinian down to the laws against witchcraft ofEngland and America -- obsolete but not repealed to this day -- such incantations, even when only suspected, were punished ascriminal. Why punish a chimera? And still we read of Constantine, the Emperor, sentencing to death the philosopher Sopatrus forunchaining the winds, and thus preventing ships loaded with grain from arriving in time to put an end to famine. Pausanias, whenaffirming that he saw with his own eyes \"men who by simple prayers and incantations\" stopped a strong hail-storm, is derided.

For if, as Sir William Grove has it, the electricity we handle is but the result of ordinary matter affectedby something invisible, the \"ultimate generating power\" of every Force, the \"one omnipresent influence,\" then it only becomesnatural that one should believe as the ancients did; namely, that every Element is dual in its nature. \"ETHEREAL fire is theemanation of the KABIR proper; the aerial is but the union (correlation) of the former with terrestrial fire, and its guidance andapplication on our earthly plane belongs to a Kabir of a lesser dignity\" -- an Elemental, perhaps, as an Occultist would call it; and thesame may be said of every Cosmic Element.No one will deny that the human being is possessed of various forces: magnetic, sympathetic, antipathetic, nervous, dynamical,occult, mechanical, mental -- every kind of force; and that the physical forces are all biological in their essence, seeing that theyintermingle with, and often merge into, those forces that we have named intellectual and moral -- the first being the vehicles, so tosay, the upadhi, of the second. No one, who does not deny soul in man, would hesitate in------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 470 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.saying that their presence and commingling are the very essence of our being; that they constitute the Ego in man, in fact. Thesepotencies have their physiological, physical, mechanical, as well as their nervous, ecstatic, clairaudient, and clairvoyant phenomena,which are now regarded and recognised as perfectly natural, even by science. Why should man be the only exception in nature, andwhy cannot even the ELEMENTS have their vehicles, their \"Vahans\" in what we call the PHYSICAL FORCES? And why, above all,should such beliefs be called \"superstition\" along with the religions of old?--------------§ XV.ON KWAN-SHI-YIN AND KWAN-YIN.LIKE Avalokiteshwara, Kwan-shi-yin has passed through several transformations, but it is an error to say of him that he is a moderninvention of the Northern Buddhists, for under another appellation he has been known from the earliest times. The Secret Doctrineteaches that \"He who is the first to appear at Renovation will be the last to come before Re-absorption (pralaya).\" Thus the logoi of allnations, from the Vedic Visvakarma of the Mysteries down to the Saviour of the present civilised nations, are the \"Word\" who was \"inthe beginning\" (or the reawakening of the energising powers of Nature) with the One ABSOLUTE. Born of Fire and Water, beforethese became distinct elements, IT was the \"Maker\" (fashioner or modeller) of all things; \"without him was not anything made that wasmade\"; \"in whom was life, and the life was the light of men\"; and who finally may be called, as he ever has been, the Alpha and theOmega of manifested Nature. \"The great Dragon of Wisdom is born of Fire and Water, and into Fire and Water will all be re-absorbedwith him\" (Fa-Hwa-King). As this Bodhisatva is said \"to assume any form he pleases\" from the beginning of a Manvantara to its end,though his special birthday (memorial day) is celebrated according to the Kin-kwang-ming-King (\"Luminous Sutra of Golden Light\") inthe second month on the nineteenth day, and that of \"Maitreya Buddha\" in the first month on the first day, yet the two are one. Hewill appear as Maitreya Buddha, the last of the Avatars and Buddhas, in the seventh Race. This belief and expectation are universalthroughout the East. Only it is not in the Kali yug, our present terrifically materialistic age of Darkness, the \"Black Age,\" that a newSaviour of Humanity can ever appear. The Kali yug is------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 471 DISEASED IMAGINATION.\"l'Age d'Or\" (!) only in the mystic writings of some French pseudo-Occultists. (See \"La Mission des Juifs.\")Hence the ritual in the exoteric worship of this deity was founded on magic. The Mantras are all taken from special books kept secretby the priests, and each is said to work a magical effect; as the reciter or reader produces, by simply chanting them, a secret causationwhich results in immediate effects. Kwan-Shi-Yin is Avalokiteshwara, and both are forms of the seventh Universal Principle; while in itshighest metaphysical character this deity is the synthetic aggregation of all the planetary Spirits, Dhyani Chohans. He is the \"Self-manifested;\" in short, the \"Son of the Father.\" Crowned with seven dragons, above his statue there appears the inscription Pu-Tsi-K'iun-ling, \"the universal Saviour of all living beings.\"Of course the name given in the archaic volume of the Stanzas is quite different, but Kwan-Yin is a perfect equivalent. In a temple ofPu'to, the sacred island of the Buddhists in China, Kwan-Shi-Yin is represented floating on a black aquatic bird (Kala-Hansa), andpouring on the heads of mortals the elixir of life, which, as it flows, is transformed into one of the chief Dhyani-Buddhas -- the Regentof a star called the \"Star of Salvation.\" In his third transformation Kwan-Yin is the informing spirit or genius of Water. In China theDalai-Lama is believed to be an incarnation of Kwan-Shi-Yin, who in his third terrestrial appearance was a Bodhisattva, while theTeshu Lama is an incarnation of Amitabha Buddha, or Gautama.It may be remarked en passant that a writer must indeed have a diseased imagination to discover phallic worship everywhere, as dothe authors of \"China Revealed\" (McClatchey) and \"Phallicism.\" The first discovers \"the old phallic gods, represented under twoevident symbols -- the Khan or Yang, which is the membrum virile, and the Kwan or Yin, the pudendum muliebre.\" (See \"Phallicism,\""},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"p. 273.) Such a rendering seems the more strange as Kwan-Shi-Yin (Avalokiteswara) and Kwan-Yin, besides being now the patrondeities of the Buddhist ascetics, the Yogis of Thibet, are the gods of chastity, and are, in their esoteric meaning, not even that which isimplied in the rendering of Mr. Rhys Davids' \"Buddhism,\" (p. 202): \"The name Avalokiteshwara . . . means 'the Lord who looks downfrom on high.' \"Nor is Kwan-Shi-Yin \"the Spirit of the Buddhas present in the Church,\" but, literally interpreted, it means \"the Lord thatis seen,\" and in one sense, \"the divine SELF perceived by Self\" (the human) -- the Atman or seventh principle merged in theUniversal, perceived by, or the object of perception to, Buddhi, the sixth principle or divine Soul in man. In a still higher sense,Avalokiteshwara = Kwan-Shi-Yin, referred to as the seventh Universal principle, is the Logos------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 472 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.perceived by the Universal Buddhi -- or Soul, as the synthetic aggregate of the Dhyani-Buddhas: and is not the \"Spirit of Buddhapresent in the Church,\" but the omnipresent universal Spirit manifested in the temple of Kosmos or Nature. This Orientalisticetymology of Kwan and Yin is on a par with that of \"Yogini,\" which, we are told by Mr. Hargrave Jennings, \"is a Sanskrit word, in thedialects pronounced Yogi or Zogee (!), and is equivalent to Sena, and exactly the same as Duti or Duti-Ca' -- i.e., a sacred prostitute ofthe temple, worshipped as Yoni or Sakti\" (p. 60). \"The books of morality,\" in India, \"direct a faithful wife to shun the society of Yoginior females who have been adored as Sakti . . . amongst the votaries of a most licentious description.\" Nothing should surprise us afterthis. And it is, therefore, with hardly a smile that we find another preposterous absurdity quoted about \"Budh,\" as being a name \"whichsignifies not only the sun as the source of generation but also the male organ (Round Towers of Ireland; quoted by Mr. HargraveJennings in \"Phallicism,\" p. 264). Max Muller, in his \"False Analogies,\" says that \"the most celebrated Chinese scholar of his time,Abel Remusat,\" maintains \"that the three syllables I Hi Wei (in the fourteenth chapter of the Tao-te-king) were meant for Je-ho-vah(Science of Religion, p. 332); and again, Father Amyot, who \"feels certain that the three persons of the Trinity could be recognised\"in the same work. And if Abel Remusat, why not Hargrave Jennings? Every scholar will recognise the absurdity of ever seeing in Budh,\"the enlightened\" and \"the awakened,\" a \"phallic symbol.\"Kwan-shi-yin, then, is \"the Son identical with his Father\" mystically, or the Logos -- the word. He is called the \"Dragon of Wisdom\" inStanza III., as all the Logoi of all the ancient religious systems are connected with, and symbolised by, serpents. In old Egypt, the GodNahbkoon, \"he who unites the doubles,\" (astral light re-uniting by its dual physiological and spiritual potency the divine human to itspurely divine Monad, the prototype \"in heaven\" or Nature) was represented as a serpent on human legs, either with or without arms. Itwas the emblem of the resurrection of Nature, as also of Christ with the Ophites, and of Jehovah as the brazen serpent healing thosewho looked at him; the serpent being an emblem of Christ with the Templars also, (see the Templar degree in Masonry). The symbolof Knouph (Khoum also), or the soul of the world, says Champollion (Pantheon, text 3), \"is represented among other forms under thatof a huge serpent on human legs; this reptile, being the emblem of the good genius and the veritable Agathodaemon, is sometimesbearded.\" The sacred animal is thus identical with the serpent of the Ophites, and is figured on a great number of engraved stones,called Gnostic or Basilidean gems. This serpent appears with various heads (human and animal), but its gems------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 473 SNOBS, OR DRAGONS?are always found inscribed with the name [[CHNOUBIS]] (Chnoubis). This symbol is identical with one which, according to Jamblichusand Champollion, was called \"the first of the celestial gods\"; the god Hermes, or Mercury with the Greeks, to which god HermesTrismegistos attributes the invention of, and the first initiation of men into, magic; and Mercury is Budh, Wisdom, Enlightenment, or\"Re-awakening\" into the divine Science.To close, Kwan-Shi-Yin and Kwan-Yin are the two aspects (male and female) of the same principle in Kosmos, Nature and Man, ofdivine wisdom and intelligence. They are the \"Christos-Sophia\" of the mystic Gnostics -- the Logos and its Sakti. In their longing forthe expression of some mysteries never to be wholly comprehended by the profane, the Ancients, knowing that nothing could bepreserved in human memory without some outward symbol, have chosen the (to us) often ridiculous images of the Kwan-Yins toremind man of his origin and inner nature. To the impartial, however, the Madonnas in crinolines and the Christs in white kid glovesmust appear far more absurd than the Kwan-Shi-Yin and Kwan-Yin in their dragon garb. The subjective can hardly be expressed bythe objective. Therefore, since the symbolic formula attempts to characterise that which is above scientific reasoning, and as often farbeyond our intellects, it must needs go beyond that intellect in some shape or other, or else it will fade out from humanremembrance.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page 474]][[blank]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page 475]]BOOK I. -- PART III.ADDENDA."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"SCIENCE AND THE SECRETDOCTRINE CONTRASTED.\"The knowledge of this nether world --Say, friend, what is it, false or true?The false, what mortal cares to know?The true, what mortal ever knew?\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page 476]]CONTENTS.--------------PAGEI.

They seemed to encounter insuperable difficulties in the way of their acceptance, and to require reconsiderationin view of scientific criticism. Some friends have already been tempted to regret the necessity of so often calling in question the"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"assertions of modern Science. It appeared to them -- and I here repeat only their arguments -- that \"to run counter to the teachings ofits most eminent exponents, was to court a premature discomfiture in the eyes of the Western World.\"It is, therefore, desirable to define once and for all the position which the writer, who does not agree in this with her friends, intends tomaintain. So far as Science remains what in the words of Prof. Huxley it is, viz., \"organized common sense\"; so far as its inferences aredrawn from accurate premises -- its generalizations resting on a purely inductive basis -- every Theosophist and Occultist welcomesrespectfully and with due admiration its contributions to the domain of cosmological law. There can be no possible conflict betweenthe teachings of occult and so-called exact Science, where the conclusions of the latter are grounded on a substratum of unassailablefact. It is only when its more ardent exponents, over-stepping the limits of observed phenomena in order to penetrate into the arcanaof Being, attempt to wrench the formation of Kosmos and its living Forces from Spirit, and attribute all to blind matter, that theOccultists claim the right to dispute and call in question their theories. Science cannot, owing to the very nature of things, unveil themystery of the universe around us. Science can, it is true, collect, classify, and generalize upon phenomena; but the occultist, arguingfrom admitted metaphysical data, declares that the daring explorer, who would probe the inmost secrets of Nature, must transcend thenarrow limitations of sense, and transfer his consciousness into the region of noumena and the sphere of primal causes. To effect this,he must develop faculties which are absolutely------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 478 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.dormant -- save in a few rare and exceptional cases -- in the constitution of the off-shoots of our present Fifth Root-race in Europe andAmerica. He can in no other conceivable manner collect the facts on which to base his speculations. Is this not apparent on theprinciples of Inductive Logic and Metaphysics alike?On the other hand, whatever the writer may do, she will never be able to satisfy both Truth and Science. To offer the reader asystematic and uninterrupted version of the Archaic Stanzas is impossible. A gap of 43 verses or Slokas has to be left between the 7th(already given) and the 51st, which is the subject of Book II., though the latter are made to run from 1 et seq. for easier reading andreference. The appearance of man on Earth alone occupies as many stanzas, which describe minutely his primal evolution from thehuman Dhyan Chohans; the state of the globe at that time, etc., etc. A great number of names referring to chemical substances andother compounds, which have now ceased to combine together, and are therefore unknown to the later offshoots of our Fifth Race,occupy a considerable space. As they are simply untranslateable, and would remain in every case inexplicable, they are omitted,along with those which cannot be made public. Nevertheless, even the little that is given will irritate any follower and defender ofdogmatic materialistic Science who happens to read this.Before proceeding to other Stanzas, it is proposed, therefore, to defend those already given. They are not in perfect accord orharmony with modern Science -- this we all know. Had they been, however, as much in agreement with the views of modernknowledge as a lecture by Sir W. Thomson, they would have been rejected all the same. For they teach belief in conscious Powersand Spiritual Entities; in terrestrial, semi-intelligent, and highly intellectual Forces on other planes*; and in Beings that dwell aroundus in spheres imperceptible, whether through telescope or microscope. Hence the necessity of examining the beliefs of materialisticScience: of comparing its views about the \"Elements\" with the opinions of the ancients, and of analysing the physical Forces as theyexist in modern perception before the Occultists admit themselves to be in the wrong. We shall touch upon the constitution of the Sunand planets, and the occult characteristics of what are called Devas and Genii, and are now termed by Science, Force, or \"modes ofmotion,\" and see whether esoteric belief is defensible or not (Vide infra, \"Gods, Monads, and Atoms)\". Notwithstanding the effortsmade to the contrary, an unprejudiced mind will discover[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Their intellection, of course, being of quite a different nature to any we can conceive of on Earth.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 479 DUAL NATURE OF THE SUN.under Newton's \"agent, material or immaterial\" (of his third letter to Bentley), the agent which causes gravity, and, in his personalworking God, one finds just as much of the metaphysical devas and genii, as in Kepler's angelus rector conducting each planet, andthe species immateriata by which the celestial bodies were carried along in their courses, according to that astronomer.We shall have, in Book II., to openly approach dangerous subjects. We must bravely face Science and declare, in the teeth ofmaterialistic learning, of Idealism, Hylo-Idealism, Positivism and all-denying modern Psychology, that the true Occultist believes in\"Lords of Light;\" that he believes in a Sun, which, far from being simply \"a lamp of day\" moving in accordance with physical law, andfar from being merely one of those Suns, which according to Richter -- \". . . . are Sun-flowers of a higher light\" -- is, like milliards ofother Suns, the dwelling or the vehicle of a god, and a host of gods.In this question, of course, it is the Occultists who will be worsted. They will be considered on the prima facie aspect of the dispute tobe ignoramuses, and labelled with more than one of the usual epithets given to those whom the superficially judging public, itselfignorant of the great underlying truths in nature, accuses of believing in mediaeval superstitions. Let it be so. Submitting beforehandto every criticism in order to go on with their task, they only claim the privilege of showing that the physicists are as much atloggerheads among themselves in their speculations, as the latter are with the teachings of Occultism."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The Sun is matter, and the Sun is Spirit.

Weprefer the charge of folly in believing too much, to that of a madness which denies everything, as do Materialism and Idealism.Hence, the Occultists are fully prepared to receive their dues from Materialism, and to meet the adverse criticism which will be pouredon this work, not for writing it, but for believing in that which it contains.Therefore the discoveries, hypotheses, and unavoidable objections which will be brought forward by the scientific critics must beanticipated and disposed of. It has also to be shown how far the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 480 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.occult teachings depart from real science, and whether the ancient or the modern theories are the most logically and philosophicallycorrect. The unity and mutual relations of all parts of Kosmos were known to the ancients, before they became evident to modernastronomers and philosophers. And if even the external and visible portions of the Universe and their mutual relations cannot beexplained in any other terms than those used by the adherents of the mechanical theory of the Universe in physical science, it followsthat no materialist, who denies that the Soul of Kosmos (which appertains to metaphysical philosophy) exists, has the right to trespassupon that metaphysical domain. That physical science is trying to, and actually does, encroach upon it, is only one more proof that\"might is right,\" and no more.Another good reason for these Addenda is this. Since only a certain portion of the Secret teachings can be given out in the presentage, if they were published without any explanations or commentary, the doctrines would never be understood even by theosophists.Therefore they must be contrasted with the speculations of modern science. Archaic axioms must be placed side by side with modernhypotheses and comparison left to the sagacious reader.On the question of the \"Seven Governors,\" as Hermes calls the \"Seven Builders,\" the Spirits which guide the operations of nature, theanimated atoms of which are the shadows, in their world, of their Primaries in the astral realms -- this work will, of course, besides themen of Science, have every materialist against it. But this opposition can, at most, be only temporary. People have laughed ateverything and scouted every unpopular idea at first, and then ended by accepting it. Materialism and scepticism are evils that mustremain in the world as long as man has not quitted his present gross form to don the one he had during the first and second races ofthis Round. Unless scepticism and our present natural ignorance are equilibrated by intuition and a natural spirituality, every beingafflicted with such feelings will see in himself no better than a bundle of flesh, bones, and muscles, with an empty garret inside himwhich serves the purpose of storing his sensations and feelings. Sir Humphry Davy was a great scientist, as deeply versed in physics asany theorist of our day, yet he loathed materialism. \"I heard with disgust,\" he says, \"in the dissecting-rooms, the plan of thephysiologist, of the gradual secretion of matter, and its becoming endued with irritability, ripening into sensibility, and acquiring suchorgans as were necessary, by its own inherent forces, and at last rising into intellectual existence.\" Nevertheless, physiologists are notthe most to be blamed for speaking of that only which they can see and estimate on the evidence of their physical senses.Astronomers------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 481 THE SONS OF LIGHT.and physicists are, we consider, far more illogical in their materialistic views than even physiologists, and this has to be proved.Milton's --. . . . . . . . . . . . \"LightEthereal, first of things, quintessence pure,\"has become with the materialists only --. . . . . .

It is the \"Spirit of Light,\" the first born of the Eternal pure Element, whose energy (oremanation) is stored in the Sun, the great Life-Giver of the physical world, as the hidden Concealed Spiritual Sun is the Light- andLife-Giver of the Spiritual and Psychic Realms. Bacon was one of the first to strike the key-note of materialism, not only by hisinductive method (renovated from ill-digested Aristotle), but by the general tenor of his writings. He inverts the order of mentalEvolution when saying that \"the first Creation of God was the light of the sense; the last was the light of the reason; and his Sabbathwork ever since is the illumination of the Spirit.\" It is just the reverse. The light of Spirit is the eternal Sabbath of the mystic oroccultist, and he pays little attention to that of mere sense. That which is meant by the allegorical sentence, \"Fiat Lux\" is,-- whenesoterically rendered -- \"Let there be the 'Sons of Light,' \" or the noumena of all phenomena.

Therefore matter, though it is, in one sense, but the illusive dregs of that Lightwhose limbs are the Creative Forces, yet has in it the full presence of the Soul thereof, of that Principle, which none -- not even the\"Sons of Light,\" evolved from its ABSOLUTE DARKNESS -- will ever know.

To know what is light, and whetherit is an actual substance or a mere undulation of the \"ethereal medium,\" Science has first to learn what are in reality Matter, Atom,Ether, Force. Now, the truth is, that it knows nothing of any of these, and admits it. It has not even agreed what to believe in, asdozens of hypotheses emanating from various and very eminent Scientists on the same subject, are antagonistic to each other andoften self-contradictory. Thus their learned speculations may, with a stretch of good-will, be accepted as \"working hypotheses\" in asecondary sense, as Stallo puts it. But being radically inconsistent with each other, they must finally end by mutually destroyingthemselves. As declared by the author of \"Concepts of Modern Physics\":--\"It must not be forgotten that the several departments of Science are simply arbitrary divisions of labour. In these several departmentsthe same physical object may be considered under different aspects. The physicist may study its molecular relations, while thechemist determines its atomic constitution. But when they both deal with the same element or agent, it cannot have one set ofproperties in physics, and another set contradictory of them, in chemistry. If the physicist and chemist alike assume the existence ofultimate atoms absolutely invariable in bulk and weight, the atom cannot be a cube or oblate spheroid for physical, and a sphere forchemical purposes. A group of constant atoms cannot be an aggregate of extended and absolutely inert and impenetrable masses ina crucible or retort, and a system of mere centres of force as part of a magnet or of a Clamond battery. The universal Ether cannot besoft and mobile to please the chemist, and rigid-elastic to satisfy the physicist; it cannot be continuous at the command of Sir WilliamThomson and discontinuous on the suggestion of Cauchy or Fresnel.\"*The eminent physicist, G. A. Hirn, may likewise be quoted saying the same in the 43rd Volume of the Memoires de l'AcademieRoyale de Belgique, which we translate from the French, as cited: \"When one sees the assurance with which are to-day affirmeddoctrines which attribute the collectivity, the universality of the phenomena to the motions alone of the atom, one has a right toexpect to find likewise unanimity on the qualities described to this unique being, the foundation of all that exists. Now, from the firstexamination of the particular systems proposed, one feels the strangest deception; one perceives that the atom of the chemist, theatom of the physicist, that of the metaphysician, and that of the mathematician . . . . have absolutely nothing in common but thename!

The metaphysician banishes the principles of attraction and repulsion as dreams; the mathematician, who analyses thelaws of elasticity and those of the propagation of light, admits them implicitly, without even naming them. . . . The chemist cannotexplain the grouping of the atoms, in his often complicated molecules, without attributing to his atoms specific distinguishingqualities; for the physicist and the metaphysician, partisans of the modern doctrines, the atom is, on the contrary, always andeverywhere the same. What am I saying? THERE IS NO AGREEMENT EVEN IN ONE AND THE SAME SCIENCE AS TO THEPROPERTIES OF THE ATOM. Each constructs an atom to suit his own fancy, in order to explain some special phenomenon withwhich he is particularly concerned.\"*The above is the photographically correct image of modern Science and physics. The \"pre-requisite of that incessant play of the'scientific imagination,' \" which is so often found in Professor Tyndall's eloquent discourses, is vivid indeed, as shown by Stallo, andfor contradictory variety leaves far behind it any \"phantasies\" of occultism. However it may be, if physical theories are confessedly\"mere formal, explanatory, didactic devices,\" and if \"atomism is only a symbolical graphic system,\"** then the occultist can hardly be"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"regarded as assuming too much, when he places alongside of these devices and \"symbolical systems\" of modern Science, thesymbols and devices of Archaic teachings.--------------III.\"AN LUMEN SIT CORPUS, NEC NON?\"MOST decidedly Light is not a body, we are told.

For this discovery, the knowledge -- whatever it may be worth -- that light or caloric is not a motion of material particles,Science is chiefly indebted, if not solely, to Sir W. Grove. It was he who was the first in a lecture at the London Institution, in 1842, toshow that[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Recherches experimentales sur la relation qui existe entre la resistance de Pair et sa temperature,\" p. 68.** From the criticism of \"Concepts of Modern Physics\" in Nature.

Yet, perhaps, for some physicists -- as for Oersted, a very eminentScientist -- FORCE and FORCES were tacitly \"Spirit (and hence Spirits) in Nature.\" What several rather mystical Scientists taught wasthat light, heat, magnetism, electricity and gravity, etc., were not the final causes of the visible phenomena, including planetarymotion, but themselves the Secondary effects of other Causes, for which Science in our day cares very little, but in which Occultismbelieves, for the Occultists have exhibited proofs of the validity of their claims in every age. And in what age were there no Occultistsand no ADEPTS?Sir Isaac Newton held to the Pythagorean corpuscular theory, and was also inclined to admit its consequences; which made the Countde Maistre hope, at one time, that Newton would ultimately lead Science back to the recognition of the fact that Forces and theCelestial bodies were propelled and guided by Intelligences (Soirees, vol. ii.). But de Maistre counted without his host. The innermostthoughts and ideas of Newton were perverted, and of his great mathematical learning only the mere physical husk was turned toaccount. Had poor Sir Isaac foreseen to what use his successors and followers would apply his \" gravity,\"** that pious and religiousman would surely have quietly eaten his apple, and never breathed a word about any mechanical ideas connected with its fall.Great contempt is shown for metaphysics generally and for onto-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Mr. Robert Ward, discussing the questions of Heat and Light in the November Journal of Science, 1881, shows us how utterlyignorant is Science about one of the commonest facts of nature -- the heat of the sun. He says:-- \"The question of the temperature ofthe sun has been the subject of investigation with many scientists: Newton, one of the first investigators of this problem, tried todetermine it, and after him all the scientists who have been occupied with calorimetry have followed his example. All have believedthemselves successful, and have formulated their results with great confidence. The following, in the chronological order of thepublication of the results, are the temperatures (in centigrade degrees) found by each of them: Newton, 1,699,300 deg.; Pouillet,1,461 deg.; Tollner, 102,200 deg.; Secchi, 5,344,840 deg.; Ericsson, 2,726,700 deg.; Fizeau, 7,500 deg.; Waterston, 9,000,000 deg.;Spoeren, 27,000 deg.; Deville, 9,500 deg.; Soret, 5,801,846 deg.; Vicaire, 1,500 deg.; Rosetti, 20,000 deg. The difference is as1,400 deg. against 9,000,000 deg., or no less than 8,998,600 deg.!! There probably does not exist in science a more astonishingcontradiction than that revealed in these figures. And yet without doubt if an Occultist were to give out an estimate, each of thesegentlemen would vehemently protest in the name of 'EXACT' Science at the rejection of his special result.\" (From the Theosophist.)** According to one atheistic idealist -- Dr. Lewins -- \"When Sir Isaac, in 1687 . . . . showed mass and atom acted upon . . . . by innateactivity . . . . he effectually disposed of Spirit, Anima, or Divinity, as supererogatory.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 485 THE METAPHYSICS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE.logical metaphysics especially. But we see, whenever the Occultists are bold enough to raise their diminished heads, thatmaterialistic, physical science is honey-combed with metaphysics;* that its most fundamental principles, while inseparably wedded totranscendentalism, are nevertheless, in order to show modern science divorced from such \"dreams,\" tortured and often ignored in themaze of contradictory theories and hypotheses. A very good corroboration of this charge lies in the fact that Science finds itselfabsolutely compelled to accept the \"hypothetical\" Ether and to try to explain it on the materialistic grounds of atomo-mechanicallaws. This attempt has led directly to the most fatal discrepancies and radical inconsistencies between the assumed nature of Ether"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"and its physical actions. A second proof is found in the many contradictory statements about the atom -- the most metaphysical objectin creation.Now, what does the modern science of physics know of AEther, the first concept of which belongs undeniably to ancient philosophers,the Greeks having borrowed it from the Aryans, and the origin of modern AEther being found in, and disfigured from, AKASA? Thisdisfigurement[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Stallo's above-cited work, \"Concepts of Modern Physics,\" a volume which has called forth the liveliest protests and criticisms, isrecommended to anyone inclined to doubt this statement. \"The professed antagonism of Science to metaphysics,\" he writes, \"has ledthe majority of scientific specialists to assume that the methods and results of empirical research are wholly independent of the controlof the laws of thought. They either silently ignore, or openly repudiate, the simplest canons of logic, including the laws of non-contradiction and . . . resent with the utmost vehemence, every application of the rule of consistency to their hypotheses and theories .. . . and they regard an examination (of these) . . . . in the light of these laws as an impertinent intrusion of 'a priori principles andmethods' into the domains of empirical science. Persons of this cast of mind find no difficulty in holding that atoms are absolutelyinert, and at the same time asserting that these atoms are perfectly elastic; or in maintaining that the physical universe, in its lastanalysis, resolves itself into 'dead' matter and motion, and yet denying that all physical energy is in reality kinetic; or in proclaimingthat all phenomenal differences in the objective world are ultimately due to the various motions of absolutely simple material units,and, nevertheless, repudiating the proposition that these units are equal\" . . . . (p. xix.) \"The blindness of eminent physicists to some ofthe most obvious consequences of their own theories is marvellous . . . . When Prof. Tait, in conjunction with Prof. Stewart, announcesthat 'matter is simply passive' (The Unseen Universe, sec. 104), and then, in connection with Sir W. Thomson, declares that 'matter hasan innate power of resisting external influences' (Treat. on Nat. Phil., Vol. I., sec. 216), it is hardly impertinent to inquire how thesestatements are to be reconciled. When Prof. Du Bois Reymond . . . . insists upon the necessity of reducing all the processes of natureto motions of a substantial, indifferent substratum, wholly destitute of quality ('Ueber die Grenzen des Naturerkennens,' p. 5), havingdeclared shortly before in the same lecture that 'resolution of all changes in the material world into motions of atoms caused by theirconstant central forces would be the completion of natural science,' we are in a perplexity from which we have to be relieved.\" (Pref.xliii.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 486 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.is claimed to be a modification and refinement of the idea of Lucretius. Let us then examine the modern concept from severalscientific volumes containing the admissions of the physicists themselves.The existence of Ether is accepted by physical astronomy, in ordinary physics, and in chemistry. Astronomers, who first began byregarding it as a fluid of extreme tenuity and mobility, offering no sensible resistance to the motions of celestial bodies, never gave athought to its continuity or discontinuity. \"Its main function in modern astronomy has been to serve as a basis for hydrodynamicaltheories of gravitation. In physics this fluid appeared for some time in several roles in connection with the 'imponderables'\" -- socruelly put to death by Sir W. Grove. Some physicists have even identified the ether of space with those \"imponderables.\" Then cametheir Kinetic theories; and from the date of the dynamical theory of heat, it was chosen in optics as a substratum for luminousundulations. Then, in order to explain the dispersion and polarization of light, physicists had to resort once more to their \"scientificimagination\" and forthwith endowed the Ether with (a) atomic or molecular structure, and (b) with an enormous elasticity, \"so that itsresistance to deformation far exceeded that of the most rigid elastic bodies\" (Stallo). This necessitated the theory of the essentialdiscontinuity of matter, hence of Ether. After having accepted this discontinuity, in order to account for dispersion and polarization,theoretical impossibilities were discovered with regard to such dispersions. Cauchy's \"scientific imagination\" saw in atoms \"materialpoints without extension,\" and he proposed, in order to obviate the most formidable obstacles to the undulatory theory (namely, somewell-known mechanical theorems which stood in the way), to assume that the ethereal medium of propagation, instead of beingcontinuous, should consist of particles separated by sensible distances. Fresnel rendered the same service to the phenomena ofpolarization. E. B. Hunt upset the theories of both (Silliman's Journal, vol. viii., p. 364 et seq.) There are now men of Science whoproclaim them \"materially fallacious,\" while others -- the \"atomo-mechanicalists\" -- cling to to them with desperate tenacity. Thesupposition of an atomic or molecular constitution of ether is upset, moreover, by thermodynamics, for Clerk Maxwell showed that sucha medium would be simply gas.* The hypothesis of \"finite intervals\" is thus proven of no avail as a supplement to the undulatorytheory. Besides, eclipses fail to reveal any such variation of colour as supposed by Cauchy (on the assumption that the chromatic raysare propagated with different velocities).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Clerk Maxwell's \"Treatise on Electricity of Magnetism\" and compare with Cauchy's \"Memoire sur la Dispersion de la lumiere.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 487 SCIENTIFIC IMAGINATION.Astronomy has pointed out more than one phenomenon absolutely at variance with this doctrine.Thus, while in one department of physics the atomo-molecular constitution of the ether is accepted in order to account for one set ofspecial phenomena, in another department such a constitution is found quite subversive of a number of well-ascertained facts, Hirn'scharges being thus justified (vide supra). Chemistry deemed it impossible to concede enormous elasticity to the ether without"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"depriving it of other properties, upon the assumption of which the construction of its modern theories depended. This ended in a finaltransformation of ether. The exigencies of the atomo-mechanical theory have led distinguished mathematicians and physicists toattempt to substitute for the traditional atoms of matter, peculiar forms of vortical motion in a \"universal homogeneous,incompressible, and continuous material medium,\" or AEther. (See Stallo.)The present writer, claiming no great scientific education, but only a tolerable acquaintance with modern theories, and a better onewith Occult Sciences, picks up weapons against the detractors of the esoteric teaching in the very arsenal of modern Science. Theglaring contradictions, the mutually-destructive hypotheses of world-renowned Scientists, their mutual accusations, denunciations anddisputes, show plainly that, whether accepted or not, the Occult theories have as much right to a hearing as any of the so-calledlearned and academical hypotheses. Thus whether the followers of the Royal Society choose to accept ether as a continuous or adiscontinuous fluid matters little, and is indifferent to the present purpose. It simply points to one certainty: Official Science knowsnothing to this day of the constitution of ether. Let Science call it matter, if it likes; only neither as akasa nor as the one sacred AEtherof the Greeks, is it to be found in any of the states of matter known to modern physics. It is MATTER on quite another plane ofperception and being, and it can neither be analyzed by scientific apparatus, appreciated, nor even conceived by \"scientificimagination,\" unless the possessors thereof study the Occult Sciences. That which follows proves this statement.It is clearly demonstrated by Stallo as regards the crucial problems of modern physics (as was done by De Quatrefages and severalothers in those of anthropology, biology, etc., etc.) that, in their efforts to support their individual hypotheses and systems, the majorityof the eminent and learned materialists very often utter the greatest fallacies. Let us take the following case. Most of them reject actioin distans (one of the fundamental principles in the question of AEther or Akasa in Occultism), while, as Stallo justly observes, there isno physical action,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 488 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"which, on close examination, does not resolve itself into actio in distans\"; and he proves it.Now, metaphysical arguments, according to Professor Lodge (Nature, vol. xxvii., p. 304), are \"unconscious appeals to experience.\"And he adds that if such an experience is not conceivable, then it does not exist, etc. In his own words:-- \". . . If a highly-developedmind or set of minds, find a doctrine about some comparatively simple and fundamental matter absolutely unthinkable, it is anevidence . . . that the unthinkable state of things has no existence, etc.\"And thereupon, toward the end of his lecture, Professor Lodge indicates that the explanation of cohesion, as well as of gravity, \"is tobe looked for in the vortex-atom theory of Sir William Thomson\" (Stallo).It is needless to stop to inquire whether it is to this vortex-theory, also, that we have to look for the dropping down on earth of the firstlife-germ by a passing meteor or comet (Sir W. Thomson's hypothesis). But Mr. Lodge might be reminded of the wise criticism on hislecture in the same \"Concepts of Modern Physics.\" Noticing the above-quoted declaration by the London Professor, the author asks\"whether . . . the elements of the vortex-theory are familiar, or even possible, facts of experience? For, if they are not, clearly thattheory is obnoxious to the same criticism which is said to invalidate the assumption of ACTIO IN DISTANS\" (p. xxiv). And then theable critic shows clearly what the Ether is not, nor can ever be, notwithstanding all scientific claims to the contrary. And thus he openswidely, if unconsciously, the entrance door to our occult teachings. For, as he says:--\"The medium in which the vortex-movements arise is, according to Professor Lodge's own express statement (NATURE, vol. xxvii., p.305), 'a perfectly homogeneous, incompressible, continuous body, incapable of being resolved into simple elements or atoms: it is, infact, continuous, not molecular.' And after making this statement Professor Lodge adds: 'There is no other body of which we can saythis, and hence the Properties of the aether must be somewhat DIFFERENT from those of ordinary matter.' It appears, then, that thewhole vortex-atom theory, which is offered to us as a substitute for the 'metaphysical theory' of actio in distans, rests upon thehypothesis of the existence of a material medium which is utterly unknown to experience, and which has properties somewhatdifferent* from those of ordinary matter. Hence this theory, instead of being, as is claimed, a reduction of an unfamiliar fact ofexperience to a familiar fact, is,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Somewhat different!\" exclaims Stallo. \"The real import of this 'somewhat' is, that the medium in question is not, in any intelligiblesense, material at all, having none of the properties of matter.\" All the properties of matter depend upon differences and changes,and the \"hypothetical\" aether here defined is not only destitute of differences, but incapable of difference and change -- (in thephysical sense let us add). This proves that if aether is \"matter\" it is so only as something visible, tangible and existing, for spiritualsenses alone; that it is a Being indeed -- but not of our plane: Pater AEther, or Akasa.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 489 THE PHYSICAL \"PHANTOM.\"on the contrary, a reduction of a fact which is perfectly familiar, to a fact which is not only unfamiliar, but wholly unknown, unobservedand unobservable. Furthermore, the alleged vortical motion of, or rather in, the assumed ethereal medium is . . . impossible, because\"motion in a perfectly homogeneous, incompressible, and therefore continuous fluid, is not sensible motion.\" . . . . It is manifest,therefore, that wherever the vortex-atom theory may lead us, it certainly does not lead us anywhere in the region of physics, or in thedomain of verae causae.* And I may add that, inasmuch as the hypothetical undifferentiated** and undifferentiable medium is clearly"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"an involuntary re-ification of the old ontological concept pure being, the theory under discussion has all the attributes of aninapprehensible metaphysical phantom.\"A \"phantom\" indeed, which can be made apprehensible only by Occultism. From such scientific metaphysics to Occultism there ishardly one step. Those physicists who hold the view that the atomic constitution of matter is consistent with its penetrability, need notgo far out of their way to be able to account for the greatest phenomena of Occultism, now so derided by physical scientists andmaterialists. Cauchy's \"material points without extension\" are Leibnitz's monads, and at the same time the materials out of which the\"Gods\" and other invisible powers clothe themselves in bodies (vide infra, \"Gods, Monads and Atoms\"). The disintegration andreintegration of \"material\" particles without extension as a chief factor in phenomenal manifestations ought to suggest themselvesvery easily as a clear possibility, at any rate to those few scientific minds which accept M. Cauchy's views. For, disposing of thatproperty of matter which they call impenetrability by simply regarding the atoms as \"material points exerting on each other attractionsand repulsions which vary with the distances that separate them\" -- the French theorist explains that: \"From this it follows that, if itpleased the author of nature*** simply to modify the laws according to which the atoms attract or repel each other, we might instantlysee the hardest bodies penetrating each other, the smallest particles of matter occupying immense spaces, or the largest massesreducing themselves to the smallest volumes, the entire universe concentrating itself, as it were, in a single point.\" (Sept lecons dephysique Generale, p. 38 et seq., ed. Moigno.)And that \"point,\" invisible on our plane of perception and matter, is quite visible to the eye of the adept who can follow and see itpresent on other planes.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Verae causae for physical science are mayavic or illusionary causes to the Occultist, and vice versa.** Very much \"differentiated,\" on the contrary, since the day it left its laya condition.*** For the Occultists who say that the author of nature is nature itself, something indistinct and inseparable from the Deity, it followsthat those who are conversant with the occult laws of nature, and know how to change and provoke new conditions in ether, may -- notmodify the laws, but work and do the same in accordance with those immutable laws.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 490 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.IV.IS GRAVITATION A LAW?THE corpuscular theory has been unceremoniously put aside; but gravitation -- the principle that all bodies attract each other with aforce proportional directly to their masses, and inversely to the squares of the distances between them -- survives to this day andreigns, supreme as ever, in the alleged ethereal waves of Space. As a hypothesis, it had been threatened with death for itsinadequacy to embrace all the facts presented to it; as a physical law, it is the King of the late and once all-potent \"Imponderables.\"\"It is little short of blasphemy . . . . an insult to Newton's grand memory to doubt it, . . . .\" is the exclamation of an American reviewerof \"Isis Unveiled.\" Well; what is finally that invisible and intangible God in whom we should believe on blind faith? Astronomers whosee in gravitation an easy-going solution for many things, and an universal force which allows them to calculate thereby planetarymotions, care little about the Cause of Attraction. They call Gravity a law, a cause in itself. We call the forces acting under that nameeffects, and very secondary effects, too. One day it will be found that the scientific hypothesis does not answer after all; and then it willfollow the corpuscular theory of light and be consigned to rest for many scientific aeons in the archives of all exploded speculations.Has not Newton himself expressed grave doubts about the Nature of Force and the corporeality of the \"Agents,\" as they were thencalled? So has Cuvier, another scientific light shining in the night of research. He warns his readers, in the Revolution du Globe,about the doubtful nature of the so-called Forces, saying that \"it is not so sure whether those agents were not Spiritual Powers after all(des agents spirituels). At the outset of his \"Principia,\" Sir Isaac Newton took the greatest care to impress upon his school that he didnot use the word \"attraction\" with regard to the mutual action of bodies in a physical sense. To him it was, he said, a purelymathematical conception involving no consideration of real and primary physical causes. In one of the passages of his \"Principia\"(Defin. 8, B. I. Prop. 69, \"Scholium\"), he tells us plainly that, physically considered, attractions are rather impulses. In section XI.(Introduction) he expresses the opinion that \"there is some subtle spirit by the force and action of which all movements of matter aredetermined\" (see Mod. Mater., by Rev. W. F. Wilkinson); and in his third Letter to Bentley he says: \"It is inconceivable that inanimatebrute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, withoutmutual contact, as it must do if gravi-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 491 GRAVITY OR WHAT?tation, in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it. . . . That gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to matter, sothat one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else by and through whichtheir action may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man, who has in philosophicalmatters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according tocertain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial I have left to the consideration of my readers.\""},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"At this, even Newton's contemporaries got frightened -- at the apparent return of occult causes into the domain of physics. Leibnitzcalled his principle of attraction \"an incorporeal and inexplicable power.\" The supposition of an attractive faculty and a perfect voidwas characterized by Bernoulli as \"revolting,\" the principle of actio in distans finding thus no more favour then than it does now.Euler, on the other hand, thought the action of gravity was due to either a Spirit or some subtle medium. And yet Newton knew of, ifhe did not accept, the Ether of the Ancients. He regarded the intermediate space between the sidereal bodies as vacuum. Thereforehe believed in \"subtle spirit\" and Spirits as we do, guiding the so-called attraction. The above-quoted words of the great man haveproduced poor results. The \"absurdity\" has now become a dogma in the case of pure materialism, which repeats, \"No matter withoutforce, no force without matter; matter and force are inseparable, eternal and indestructible (true); there can be no independent force,since all force is an inherent and necessary property of matter (false); consequently, there is no immaterial creative power.\" Oh, poorSir Isaac!If, leaving aside all the other eminent men of Science who shared in the same opinion as Euler and Leibnitz, the Occultists claim astheir authorities and supporters only Sir Isaac Newton and Cuvier, as above cited, they need fear little from modern Science, and mayloudly and proudly proclaim their beliefs. But, the hesitation and doubts of the two before cited authorities, and of many others, too,whom we could name, did not in the least prevent scientific speculation from wool-gathering on the fields of brute matter just asbefore. First it was matter and an imponderable fluid distinct from it; then came the imponderable fluid so much criticised by Grove;and AEther, which was at first discontinuous and then became continuous; after which came the \"mechanical\" Forces. These havenow settled in life as \"modes of motion\" and the aether has become more mysterious and problematical than ever. More than oneman of Science objects to such crude materialistic views. But then since the days of Plato, who repeatedly asks his readers not toconfuse incorporeal Elements with------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 492 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.their PRINCIPLES -- transcendental or spiritual Elements; from those of the great Alchemists, who, like Paracelsus, made a greatdifference between phenomenon and its cause, or the Noumenon; and Grove, who, though he sees \"no reason to divest universallydiffused matter of the functions common to all matter,\" yet uses the term Forces where his critics, \"who do not attach to the word anyidea of a specific action,\" say Force -- from those days to this nothing has proved competent to stem the tide of brutal materialism.Gravitation is the sole cause, the acting God, and matter is its prophet, said the men of science only a few years ago.They have changed their views several times since then. But do the men of Science understand the innermost thought of Newton,one of the most spiritual-minded and religious men of his day, any better now than they did then? It is certainly to be doubted.Newton is credited with having given the death-blow to the Elemental Vortices of Descartes (the idea of Anaxagoras, resurrected, by-the-bye), though the last modern \"vortical atoms\" of Sir W. Thomson do not, in truth, differ much from the former. Nevertheless, whenhis disciple Forbes wrote in the Preface to the chief work of his Master a sentence declaring that \"attraction was the cause of theSystem,\" Newton was the first to solemnly protest. That which in the mind of the great mathematician assumed the shadowy, butfirmly rooted image of God, as the noumenon of all,* was called more philosophically by the ancient (and modern) philosophers andOccultists -- \"Gods,\" or the creative fashioning Powers. The modes of expression may have been different, and the ideas more or lessphilosophically enunciated by all sacred and profane Antiquity; but the fundamental thought was the same.** For Pythagoras theForces were Spiritual Entities, Gods inde-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Attraction,\" Le Couturier, a materialist, writes, \"has now become for the public that which it was for Newton himself -- a simple word,an idea\" (Panorama des Mondes), since its cause is unknown. Herschell virtually says the same, when remarking, that wheneverstudying the motion of the heavenly bodies, and the phenomena of attraction, he feels penetrated at every moment with the idea of\"the existence of causes that act for us under a veil, disguising their direct action.\" (Musee des Sciences, August, 1856.)** If we are taken to task for believing in operating \"Gods\" and \"Spirits\" while rejecting a personal God, we answer to the Theists andMonotheists: \"Admit that your Jehovah is one of the Elohim, and we are ready to recognise him. Make of him, as you do, the Infinite,the ONE and the Eternal God, and we will never accept him in this character.\" Of tribal Gods there were many; the One UniversalDeity is a principle, an abstract Root-Idea which has nought to do with the unclean work of finite Form. We do not worship the Gods,we only honour Them, as beings superior to ourselves. In this we obey the Mosaic injunction, while Christians disobey their Bible --Missionaries foremost of all. \"Thou shalt not revile the gods,\" says one of them -- (Jehovah) -- in Exodus xxii. 28); but at the same timein verse 20 it is commanded, \"He that sacrificeth to any God, save unto the Lord, he shall be utterly destroyed.\" Now in the [[Footnotecontinued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 493 THE TRIPLE SIDEREAL FORCE.pendent of planets and Matter as we see and know them on Earth, who are the rulers of the Sidereal Heaven. Plato represented theplanets as moved by an intrinsic Rector, one with his dwelling, like \"A boatman in his boat.\" As for Aristotle, he called those rulers\"immaterial substances;\"* though as one who had never been initiated, he rejected the gods as Entities (See Vossius, Vol. II., p. 528).But this did not prevent him from recognising the fact that the stars and planets \"were not inanimate masses but acting and livingbodies indeed. . . . . . .\" As if \"sidereal spirits were the divine portion of their phenomena, [[ta theoitera pon phaneron]]\" (De Caelo. I.9)."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"If we look for corroboration in more modern and Scientific times, we find Tycho Brahe recognising in the stars a triple force, divine,spiritual and vital. Kepler, putting together the Pythagorean sentence, \"The Sun, guardian of Jupiter,\" and the verses of David, \"Heplaced his throne in the Sun,\" and \"The Lord is the Sun,\" etc., said that he understood perfectly how the Pythagoreans could believethat all the globes disseminated through Space were rational Intelligences, facultates ratiocinativae, circulating around the Sun, \"inwhich resides a pure Spirit of fire; the source of the general harmony\" (De Motibus planetarum harmonicis, p. 248).When an Occultist speaks of Fohat -- the energising and guiding intelligence in the Universal Electric or Vital Fluid, -- he is laughedat. Withal, as now shown, neither the nature of electricity, nor of Life nor even of Light, are to this day understood. The Occultist seesin the manifestation of every force in Nature, the action of the quality, or the special characteristic of its noumenon; which noumenonis a distinct and intelligent Individuality on the other side of the manifested mechanical Universe. Now the Occultist does not deny --on the contrary he will support the claim -- that light, heat, electricity and so on are affections (not properties or qualities) of matter. Toput it more clearly: matter is the condition -- the necessary basis or vehicle, a sine qua non -- for the manifestation of these forces, oragents, on this plane.But in order to gain the point the Occultists have to examine the credentials of the law of gravity, first of all, of \"Gravitation, the King[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] original texts it is not \"god\" but Elohim, -- and we challenge contradiction -- and Jehovah isone of the Elohim, as proved by his own words in Genesis iii. 22, when \"the Lord God said: Behold the Man has become as one ofus,\" etc. Hence both those who worship and sacrifice to the Elohim, the angels, and to Jehovah, those who revile the gods of theirfellow-men, are far greater transgressors than the Occultists or any Theosophist. Meanwhile many of the latter prefer believing in someone \"Lord\" or other, and are quite welcome to do as they like.* To liken the \"immateriate species to wooden iron,\" and laugh at Spiller referring to them as \"incorporeal matter\" does not solve themystery (See \"Concepts of Modern Physics,\" p. 165 et infra).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 494 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and Ruler of Matter,\" under every form. To do so effectually, the hypothesis in its earliest appearance has to be recalled to mind. Tobegin with, is it Newton who was the first to discover it? The Athenaeum of Jan. 26, 1867, has some curious information upon thissubject. It says that \"positive evidence can be adduced that Newton derived all his knowledge of gravitation and its laws fromBoehme, with whom gravitation or ATTRACTION is the first property of Nature.\" . . . For with him \"his (Boehme's) system, shows us theinside of things, while modern physical science is content with looking at the outside.\" Then again, \"the science of electricity, whichwas not yet in existence when he (Boehme) wrote, is there anticipated (in his writings); and not only does Boehme describe all thenow known phenomena of that force, but he even gives us the origin, generation, and birth of electricity, itself, etc.\"Thus Newton, whose profound mind read easily between the lines, and fathomed the spiritual thought of the great Seer in its mysticrendering, owes his great discovery to Jacob Boehme, the nursling of the genii (Nirmanakayas) who watched over and guided him, ofwhom the author of the article in question so truly remarks, that \"every new scientific discovery goes to prove his profound and intuitiveinsight into the most secret workings of nature.\" And having discovered gravity, Newton, in order to render possible the action ofattraction in space, had, so to speak, to annihilate every physical obstacle capable of impeding its free action; ether among others,though he had more than a presentiment of its existence. Advocating the corpuscular theory, he made an absolute vacuum betweenthe heavenly bodies. . . . Whatever may have been his suspicions and inner convictions about Ether; however many friends he mayhave unbosomed himself to -- as in the case of his correspondence with Bentley -- his teachings never showed that he had any suchbelief. If he was \"persuaded that the power of attraction could not be exerted by matter across a vacuum,\"* how is it that so late as1860, French astronomers (Le Couturier, for instance), combated \"the disastrous results of the theory of vacuum established by thegreat man?\"** Professor Winchell writes, \"These passages (letter to Bentley) show what were his views respecting the nature of theinterplanetary medium of communication. Though declaring that the heavens 'are void of sensible matter,' he elsewhere excepted'perhaps[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* World-Life.

Dr. T. S. Hunt \"called attention tosome long-neglected passages in Newton's works, from which it appears that a belief in such universal, intercosmical mediumgradually took root in his mind.\" (Ibid.) But such attention was never called to the said passages before Nov. 28, 1881, when Dr. Huntread his \"Celestial Chemistry, from the time of Newton.\" \"Till then the idea was universal, even among the men of Science, thatNewton had, while advocating the corpuscular theory, preached a void,\" as Le Couturier says. The passages had been \"longneglected,\" no doubt because they contradicted and clashed with the preconceived pet theories of the day, till finally the undulatorytheory imperiously required the presence of an \"ethereal medium\" to explain it. This is the whole secret.Anyhow, it is from that theory of Newton's of a universal void -- taught, if not believed in by himself, -- that dates the immense scornnow shown by modern for ancient physics. The old sages had maintained that \"Nature abhorred vacuum,\" and the greatestmathematicians of the world (read of the Western races) had discovered the antiquated \"fallacy\" and exposed it. And now modernscience vindicates, however ungracefully, archaic knowledge, having, moreover, to vindicate Newton's character and powers ofobservation at this late hour, after having neglected for one century and a half to pay any attention to such very important passages --perchance, because it was wiser not to attract any notice to them. Better late than never.And now Father AEther is re-welcomed with open arms; and wedded to gravitation; linked to it for weal or woe, until the day when it,or both, shall be replaced by something else. Three hundred years ago it was plenum everywhere, then it became one dismal vacuity;later still the sidereal ocean-beds, dried up by science, rolled onward once more their ethereal waves. Recede ut procedes mustbecome the motto of exact Science -- \"exact,\" chiefly, in finding itself inexact every leap-year.But we will not quarrel with the great men. They had to go back to the earliest \"Gods of Pythagoras and old Kanada\" for the verybackbone and marrow of their correlations and \"newest\" discoveries, and this may well afford good hope to the Occultists, for theirminor gods. For we believe in Le Couturier's prophecy about gravitation. We know the day is approaching when an absolute reformwill be demanded in the present modes of Science by the scientists themselves -- as was done by Sir W. Grove, F.R.S. Till that daythere is nothing to be done. For if gravitation------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 496 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.were dethroned to-morrow, the day after the Scientists would discover some other new mode of mechanical motion.* Rough and up-hill is the path of true Science, and its days are full of vexation of Spirit. But in the face of its \"thousand\" contradictory hypotheses toexplain physical phenomena, there never was yet a better one than that of \"motion\" -- however paradoxically interpreted bymaterialism. As may be found on the first pages of Book I., Occultists have nothing surely against motion** the GREAT BREATH ofMr. Herbert Spencer's \"UNKNOWN.\" But, believing that everything on Earth is the shadow of something in space -- they believe insmaller \"Breaths,\" which, living, intelligent and independent of all but Law, blow in every direction during Manvantaric periods.These Science will reject. But whatever replaces attraction, alias gravitation, the result will be the same. Science will be as far fromthe solution of its difficulties as it is now, unless it comes to some compromise with Occultism and even with Alchemy -- whichsupposition will be regarded as an impertinence, but remains a fact, nevertheless. As Faye says: \"Il manque quelque chose auxgeologues pour faire la geologie de la Lune, c'est d'etre astronomes. A la verite il manque aussi quelquechose aux astronomes pouraborder avec fruit cette etude, c'est d'etre geologues.\" But he might have added, with still more pointedness, \"Ce qui manque a tousles deux, c'est l'intuition du mystique.\"Let us remember Sir William Grove's wise \"concluding remarks,\" on the ultimate structure of matter, or the minutiae of molecularactions, which, he thought, man will never know.\"Much harm has already been done by attempting hypothetically to dissect matter and to discuss the shapes, sizes, and numbers ofatoms, and their atmospheres of heat, ether, or electricity. . . . . Whether the regarding electricity, light, magnetism, etc., as simplymotions of ordinary matter, be or be not admissible, certain it is that all past theories have resolved, and all existing theories doresolve, the action of these forces into motion.

Butsee Treatise on Colour (Vol. III., question 31.) We are told by Herschell that Newton left with his successors the duty of drawing all thescientific conclusions from his discovery. How modern Science abused the privilege of building its newest theories upon the law ofgravitation, may be realised when one remembers how profoundly religious was that great man.** The materialistic notion that because, in physics real or sensible motion is impossible in pure space or vacuum, therefore, theeternal MOTION of and in Cosmos (regarded as infinite Space) is a fiction -- only shows once more that such words as \"pure space,\"\"pure Being,\" \"the Absolute,\" etc., of Eastern metaphysics have never been understood in the West.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 497 NEW BOTTLES FOR OLD WINE."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"explaining them, or whether it be that it is in reality the only mode in which our minds as contra-distinguished from our senses, areable to conceive material agencies, certain it is that since the period at which the mystic notions of spiritual or preternatural powerswere applied to account for physical phenomena, all hypotheses framed to explain them have resolved them into MOTION.\"And then the learned gentleman states a purely occult tenet:--\"The term perpetual motion, which I have not infrequently used in these pages, is itself equivocal. If the doctrines here advanced bewell founded, all motion is, in one sense, perpetual. In masses, whose motion is stopped by mutual concussion, heat or motion of theparticles is generated; and thus the motion continues, so that if we could venture to extend such thoughts to the universe, we shouldassume the same amount of motion affecting the same amount of matter for ever.\"*Thus, supposing attraction or gravitation should be given up in favour of the Sun being a huge magnet -- which is a theory alreadyaccepted by some physicists -- a magnet that acts on the planets as attraction is now supposed to do, whereto, or how much fartherwould it lead the astronomers from where they are now? Not an inch farther. Kepler came to this \"curious hypothesis\" nearly 300 yearsago. He had not discovered the theory of attraction and repulsion in Kosmos, for it was known from the days of Empedocles, the twoopposite forces being called by him \"hate\" and \"love\" -- which comes to the same thing. But Kepler gave a pretty fair description ofcosmic magnetism. That such magnetism exists in nature, is as certain as that gravitation does not; not at any rate, in the way inwhich it is taught by Science, which never took into consideration the different modes in which the dual Force -- that Occultism callsattraction and repulsion -- may act within our solar system, the earth's atmosphere, and beyond in the Kosmos.** This was proven byNewton himself; for there are many phenomena in our[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Correl. Phys. Forces,\" p. 173. This is precisely what Occultism maintains, and on the same principle that \"where force is made tooppose force, and produce static equilibrium, the balance of pre-existing equilibrium is affected, and fresh motion is startedequivalent to that which is withdrawn into a state of abeyance.\" This process finds intervals in the pralaya, but is eternal and ceaselessas the \"Breath,\" even when the manifested Kosmos rests.** \"Trans-solar space,\" writes the great Humboldt, \"does not hitherto show any phenomenon analogous to our solar system. It is apeculiarity of our System, that matter should have condensed within it in nebulous rings, the nuclei of which condense into earths andmoons. I say again, heretofore, nothing of the kind has ever been observed beyond our planetary system.\" (See Revue Germanique ofthe 31st Dec. 1860, art. \"Lettres et conversations d'Alexandre Humboldt.\") True, that since 1860 the nebular theory has sprung up, andbeing better known, a few identical phenomena were supposed to be observed beyond the solar system. Yet the great man is quiteright; and no earths or moons can be found -- except in appearance -- beyond, or of the same order of matter as found in our system.Such is the Occult teaching.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 498 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Solar system, which he confessed his inability to explain by the law of gravitation. \"Such were the uniformity in the directions ofplanetary movements, the nearly circular forms of the orbits, and their remarkable conformity to one plane\" (Prof. Winchell). And ifthere is one single exception, then the law of gravitation has no right to be referred to as an universal law. \"These adjustments,\" weare told, \"Newton, in his general Scholium, pronounces to be 'the work of an intelligent and all-powerful Being.' \" Intelligent that\"Being\" may be; as to \"all-powerful\" there would be every reason to doubt the claim. A poor \"God\" he, who would work upon minordetails and leave the most important to secondary forces! The poverty of the argument and logic in this case, is surpassed only by thatof Laplace, who, seeking very correctly to substitute motion for Newton's \"all-powerful Being,\" and ignorant of the true nature of thateternal motion, saw in it a blind physical law. \"Might not those arrangements be an effect of the laws of motion?\" he asks, forgetting,as all our modern Scientists do, that this law and this motion are a vicious circle, so long as the nature of both remains unexplained.His famous answer to Napoleon: \"Dieu est devenu une hypothese inutile,\" would be correctly stated only by one who adhered to thephilosophy of the Vedantins. It becomes a pure fallacy, if we exclude the interference of operating, intelligent, powerful (never \"all-powerful\") Beings, who are called \"gods.\"But we would ask the critics of the mediaeval astronomers why should Kepler be denounced as most unscientific, for offering just thesame solution as Newton did -- only showing himself more sincere, more consistent and even more logical. Where may be thedifference between Newton's \"all-powerful Being\" and Kepler's Rectores, his sidereal and Cosmic Forces, or Angels? Kepler is againcriticised for his \"curious hypothesis which made use of a vortical movement within the solar system;\" for his theories in general, for hisfavouring Empedocles' idea of attraction and repulsion, and \"Solar magnetism\" in particular. Yet several modern men of Science, aswill be shown -- Hunt (if Metcalfe is to be excluded), Dr. Richardson, etc. -- favour the idea very seriously. He is half excused, however,on the plea that \"to the time of Kepler no interaction between masses of matter had been distinctly recognized which was genericallydifferent from magnetism\" (World-Life). Is it distinctly recognised now? Does Prof. Winchell claim for Science any serious knowledgewhatever of the natures of either electricity or magnetism -- except that both seem to be the effects of some result arising from anundetermined cause.The ideas of Kepler, weeded from their theological tendencies, are purely occult. He saw that:------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 499 CHRONIC NEGATION."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"(I.)

He provided, for the constant motion and restoration of the Sun's energy and planetary motion, the perpetual care of a spirit, orspirits. The whole of Antiquity believed in this idea. The Occultists do not use the word Spirit, but say Creative Forces, which theyendow with intelligence. But we may call them spirits also.This theory is tabooed a great deal more on account of the \"Spirit\" that is given room in it, than of anything else. Herschell, the elder,believed in it likewise, and so do several modern scientists also. Nevertheless Professor Winchell declares that \"a hypothesis morefanciful, and less in accord with the requirements of physical principles, has not been offered in ancient or modern times.\" (World-Life,p. 554.)The same was said, once upon a time, of the universal Ether, and now it is not only accepted perforce but advocated as the onlypossible theory to explain away certain mysteries.Grove's ideas, when he first enunciated them in London about 1840, were called as unscientific as the above; nevertheless, his viewson the correlation of forces are now universally accepted. It would, very likely, require one more conversant with science than is thewriter, to combat with any success some of the now prevailing ideas about gravitation and other similar \"solutions\" of CosmicMysteries. But, let us recall a few objections that came from recognized men of Science; from astronomers and physicists ofeminence, who rejected the theory of rotation, as well as that of gravitation. Thus one reads in the French Encyclopaedia that\"Science agrees, in the face of all its representatives, that it is impossible to explain the physical origin of the rotatory motion of thesolar system.\"If the question is asked, \"what causes rotation?\" we are answered: \"It is the centrifugal Force.\" \"And this force, what is it that producesit?\" \"The force of rotation,\" is the grave answer.

It will be said that while we deny God, we admit Souls and operative Spirits, and quotefrom Roman Catholic bigoted writers in support of our argument. To this we reply: \"We deny the anthropomorphic god of theMonotheists, but never the Divine Principle in nature.

The profanestudent is perplexed, and does not know in which of the theories of exact science he has to believe. Here we have hypotheses enoughfor every taste and power of brain. They are all extracted from a number of scientific volumes.CURRENT HYPOTHESES EXPLAINING THE ORIGIN OF ROTATION.Rotation has originated either --(a) By the collision of nebular masses wandering aimlessly in space; or by attraction, \"in cases where no actual impact takes place.\"(b) \"By the tangential action of currents of nebulous matter (in the case of an amorphous nebula) descending from higher to lowerlevels,* or simply by the action of the central gravity of the mass.\"**\"It is a fundamental principle in physics that no rotation could be generated in such a mass by the action of its own parts.

And also,(f) That, \"the Sun has existed no more than 15,000,000 of years, and will emit heat for no longer than 10,000,000 years more\" (Sir W.Thomson's lecture on \"the latent dynamical theory regarding the probable origin, total amount of heat, and duration of the Sun,\"1887).A few years ago this eminent Scientist was telling the world that the time required for the earth to cool from incipient incrustation to itspresent state, could not exceed 80,000,000 years*; (Thomson and Tait, Natural Philosophy.) If the encrusted age of the world is only40 millions, or the half of the duration once allowed, and the Sun's age only 15 millions, have we to understand that the earth was atone time independent of the Sun?Since the ages of the Sun, planets, and the Earth, as stated in the many scientific hypotheses of the astronomers and physicists, aregiven elsewhere (infra), we have said enough to show the disagreement between the ministers of modern Science. Whether we acceptthe fifteen million years of Sir W. Thomson or the thousand millions of Mr. Huxley, for the rotational evolution of our solar system, itwill always come to this; by accepting self-generated rotation for the heavenly bodies composed of inert matter and yet moved bytheir own internal motion, for millions of years, this teaching of Science amounts to --(a) An evident denial of that fundamental physical law, which states that \"a body in motion tends constantly to inertia, (i.e., tocontinue in the same state of motion or rest), unless it is stimulated into further action by a superior active force.\"(b.) To an original impulse, which culminates in an unalterable motion, within a resisting ether that NEWTON had declaredincompatible with that motion.(c.) Universal gravity, which, we are taught, always tends to a centre in rectilinear descent -- alone the cause of the revolution of thewhole solar system, which is performing an eternal double gyration, each body around its axis and orbit. Another occasional versionis:--(d.) A magnet in the Sun; or, the said revolution due to a magnetic force, which acts, just as gravitation does, in a straight line --varying inversely as the square of the distance. (Coulomb's Law.)(e.) The whole acting under invariable and changeless laws, which are, nevertheless, often shown variable, as during some well-known freaks[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* And even on these figures Bischof disagrees with Thomson, and calculates that 350 million years would be required for the earth tocool from a temperature of 20,000 degrees to 200 degrees centigrade.

A mass, furthermore, which derives its weight from the body on which it weighs.Thus neither Laplace's perceptions of a solar atmospheric fluid, which would extend beyond the orbits of the planets, nor LeCouturier's electricity, nor Foucault's heat (Panorama des Mondes, p. 55), nor this, nor the other, can ever help any of the numeroushypotheses about the origin and permanency of rotation to escape from this squirrel's wheel, any more than the theory of gravity itself.This mystery is the Procrustean bed of physical Science. If matter is, as now taught, passive, the simplest movement cannot be said tobe an essential property of matter -- if the latter is simply an inert mass. How, then, can such a complicated movement, compoundand multiple, harmonious and equilibrated, lasting in the eternities for millions and millions of years, be attributed simply to its owninherent Force, unless the latter is an intelligence? A physical will is something new -- a conception that the ancients would havenever entertained, indeed!*\"We talk of the weight of the heavenly bodies,\" says an astronomer; \"but since it is recognised that weight decreases in proportion tothe distance from the centre, it becomes evident that, at a certain distance, that weight must be forcibly reduced to Zero?

And since the modern school recognizes neither a beneath nor an above in universalspace, it is not clear what should cause the Earth to fall, were there even no gravitation, nor attraction.\" (Cosmographie.)Methinks the Count de Maistre was right in solving the question in his own theological way. He cuts the Gordian knot by saying:-- \"The[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For over a century all distinction between body and force is made away with. \"Force is but the property of a body in motion,\" say thephysicists; and \"life -- the property of our animal organs -- is but the result of their molecular arrangement,\" answer the physiologists.\"In the bosom of that aggregate which is named planet,\" teaches Littre, \"are developed all the forces immanent to matter . . . i.e.,that matter possesses in itself and through itself the forces that are proper to it . . . and which are primary, not secondary.

For did not Herschell say the same thing when he remarked that there is a will needed to impart a circular motion, andanother will to restrain it? (Discours, 165.) This shows and explains how a retarded planet is cunning enough to calculate so well itstime as to hit off its arrival at the fixed minute. For, if Science sometimes succeeds with its great ingenuity in explaining some of suchstoppages, retrograde motions, angles outside the orbits, &c., &c., by appearances resulting from the inequality of their progress andours in the course of our mutual and respective orbits, we still know that there are others, and \"very real and considerable deviations,\"according to Herschell, \"which cannot be explained except by the mutual and irregular action of those planets and by the perturbinginfluence of the Sun.\"We understand, however, that there are, besides those little and accidental perturbations, continuous perturbations called \"secular\" --because of the extreme slowness with which the irregularity increases and affects the relations of the elliptic movement -- and thatthese perturbations can be corrected. From Newton, who found that this world needed repairing very often, down to Reynaud, all saythe same. In his Ciel et Terre (p. 28), the latter speaks of --\". . . . . The orbits described by the planets as being very far from immutable; on the contrary, subject to a perpetual mutation in theirposition and form,\" -- all prove gravitation and the peripatetic laws to be as negligent as they are quick to repair their mistakes. Thecharge as it stands seems to be that \"they (the orbits) are alternately widening and narrowing, their great axis lengthens anddiminishes, or oscillates at the same time from right to left around the Sun, the plane itself, in which they are situated, raising andlowering itself periodically while pivoting around itself with a kind of tremor. . . .\"To this, De Mirville, who believes in intelligent \"workmen\" ruling invisibly the solar system -- as we do -- observes very wittily* . . . . .\"Voila certes, a voyage which has little in it of mechanical rigour; at the utmost, one could compare it to a steamer, pulled to and froand tossed on the waves, retarded or accelerated, all and each of which impediments might put off its arrival indefinitely, were therenot the intelligences of a pilot and engineers to catch up the time lost, and to repair the damages. . . . .\"The law of gravity, however, seems to be becoming an obsolete law in starry heaven. At any rate those long-haired sidereal radicals,called comets, appear to be very poor respecters of the majesty of that law,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Deuxieme memoire, \"Manifestations Historiques,\" p. 272.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 504 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"and to beard it quite impudently. Nevertheless, and though presenting in nearly every respect \"phenomena not yet fully understood,\"comets and meteors are credited by the believers in modern Science with obeying the same laws and consisting of the same matter,\"as the Suns, stars and nebulae,\" and even \"the earth and its inhabitants.\" (Laing's \"Modern Science and Modern Thought.\")This is what one might call taking things on trust, aye, even to blind faith. But exact Science is not to be questioned, and he whorejects the hypotheses imagined by her students -- gravitation, for instance -- would be regarded as an ignorant fool for it; yet we aretold by the just cited author a queer legend from the scientific annals. \"The comet of 1811 had a tail 120 millions of miles in lengthand 25 millions of miles in diameter at the widest part, while the diameter of the nucleus was about 127,000 miles, more than tentimes that of the earth.\" He tells us, \"in order that bodies of this magnitude, passing near the earth, should not affect its motion orchange the length of the year by even a single second, their actual substance must be inconceivably rare. . . .\" It must be so indeed,yet:--\". . . . . The extreme tenuity of a comet's mass is also proved by the phenomenon of the tail, which, as the comet approaches the sun,is thrown out sometimes to a length of 90 millions of miles in a few hours. And what is remarkable, THIS TAIL IS THROWN OUTAGAINST THE FORCE OF GRAVITY by some repulsive force, probably electrical, so that it always points away from the Sun (!!!) Andyet, thin as the matter of comets must be, IT OBEYS THE COMMON LAW OF GRAVITY (!?), and whether the comet revolves in anorbit within that of the outer planets, or shoots off into the abysses of Space, and returns only after hundreds of years, its path is, ateach instant, regulated by the same force as that which causes an apple to fall to the ground.\" (Ibid, p. 17.)Science is like Caesar's wife, and must not be suspected -- this is evident. But it can be respectfully criticised, nevertheless. At allevents, it may be reminded that \"the apple\" is a dangerous fruit. For the second time in the history of mankind, it may become thecause of the FALL -- this time, of \"exact\" Science. A comet whose tail defies the law of gravity right in the Sun's face can hardly becredited with obeying that law.In a series of scientific works on Astronomy and the nebular theory, written between 1865 and 1866, the present writer, a poor tyro inScience, has counted in a few hours, no less than thirty-nine contradictory hypotheses offered as explanations for the self-generated,primitive rotatory motion of the heavenly bodies.

Occultists were threatened with terriblepenalties for questioning scientific truths. But now they feel braver -- Science is less secure in its \"impregnable\" position than theywere led to expect, and many of its strongholds are built on very shifting sands.Thus, even this poor and unscientific examination of it was useful, and it was certainly very instructive. We have learned a good manythings, in fact, having studied with particular care especially those astronomical data that would be the most likely to clash with ourheterodox and \"superstitious\" beliefs.So, for instance, we have found there, concerning gravitation, the axial and orbital motions, that synchronous movement having beenonce overcome, in the early stage -- it was enough to originate a rotatory motion till the end of Manvantara. We have also come toknow in all the aforesaid combinations of possibilities with regard to incipient rotation -- most complicated in every case, -- some ofthe causes to which it may have been due, as well as some others to which it ought and should have been due, but, in some way orother, was not. Among other things, we were informed that incipient rotation may be provoked with equal ease in a mass in igneousfusion, and in one that is characterised by glacial opacity (\"Heaven and Earth\"). That gravitation is a law which nothing canovercome, but which, nevertheless, is overcome in and out of season by the most ordinary celestial or terrestrial bodies -- the tails ofimpudent comets, for instance. That we owe the universe to the holy creative Trinity, called Inert Matter, Senseless Force and BlindChance. Of the real essence and nature of any of these three, Science knows nothing, but this is a trifling detail. Ergo, we are toldthat, when a mass of cosmic or nebular matter -- whose nature is unknown (entirely so), and which may be in a state of fusion(Laplace), or dark and cold (Thomson), for \"this intervention of heat is itself a pure hypothesis\" (Faye) -- decides to exhibit itsmechanical energy under the form of rotation, it acts in this wise. It (the mass) either bursts into spontaneous conflagration, or itremains inert, tenebrous, and frigid, both states being equally capable of sending it, without any adequate cause, spinning throughspace for millions of years. Its movements may be retrograde and they may be direct, about a hundred various reasons being offeredfor both motions, in about as many hypotheses. Anyhow, joining the maze of stars, whose origin belongs to the same miraculous andspontaneous order -- for \"the nebular theory does not profess to discover the origin of things, but only a stadium in material history\"(Winchell: World-Life) -- those millions of suns, planets, and satellites, composed of inert matter, will whirl on in most impressive andmajestic symmetry around the firmament, moved------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 506 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and guided only, their inertia notwithstanding, \"by their own internal motion.\"Shall we wonder after this if learned mystics, pious Roman Catholics, and even such learned astronomers as were Chaubard andGodefroy,* have preferred the Kabala and the ancient systems to the modern dreary and contradictory exposition of the Universe?The Zohar makes a distinction, at any rate, between \"the hajaschar (\"the light Forces\"), the hachoser (\"Reflected Lights\"), and thesimple phenomenal exteriority of their spiritual types.\" (See Kabala Denudata, II, 67.)"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The question of \"gravity\" may now be dismissed, and other hypotheses examined. That physical Science knows nothing of \"Forces\" isclear. We may close the argument, however, by calling to our help one more man of Science -- Professor Jaumes, Member of theAcademy of Medicine at Montpellier. Says this learned man, speaking of Forces:--\"A cause is that which is essentially acting in the genealogy of phenomena, in every production as in every modification. I said thatactivity (or Force) was invisible. . . . To suppose it corporeal and residing in the properties of matter would be a gratuitous hypothesis. .. To reduce all the causes to God. . . . would amount to embarrassing oneself with a hypothesis hostile to many verities. But to speakof a plurality of forces proceeding from the Deity and possessing inherent powers of their own, is not unreasonable. . . . and I amdisposed to admit phenomena produced by intermediate agents called Forces or Secondary Agents. The distinction of Forces is theprinciple of the division of Sciences; so many real and separate forces, so many mother-Sciences. . . . No: Forces are not suppositionsand abstractions, but realities, and the only acting realities whose attributes can be determined with the help of direct observation andinduction.\" (\"Sur la distinction des Forces,\" published in the Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences de Montpellier, Vol. II., fasc. I.,1854.)--------------VI.THE MASKS OF SCIENCE.PHYSICS OR METAPHYSICS?IF there is anything on earth like progress, Science will some day have to give up, nolens volens, such monstrous ideas as herphysical, self-guiding laws -- void of soul and Spirit, -- and then turn to the occult teachings.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* L'Univers explique par la Revelation, and Cosmogonie de la Revelation. But see De Mirville's Deuxieme Memoire. The author, aterrible enemy of Occultism, was yet one who wrote great truths.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 507 ACADEMICAL MISNOMERS.It has done so already, however altered are the title-page and revised editions of the Scientific Catechism. It is now over half acentury since, in comparing modern with ancient thought, it has been found that, however different our philosophy may appear fromthat of our ancestors, it is, nevertheless, composed only of additions and subtractions taken from the old philosophy and transmitteddrop by drop through the filter of antecedents.This fact was well known to Faraday, and other eminent men of Science. Atoms, Ether, evolution itself -- all comes to modern Sciencefrom ancient notions, all is based on the conceptions of the archaic nations. \"Conceptions\" for the profane, under the shape ofallegories; plain truths taught during the Initiations to the elect, which truths have been partially divulged through Greek writers andhave descended to us. This does not mean that Occultism has ever had the same views on matter, atoms and ether as found in theexotericism of the classical Greek writers. Yet, if we believe Mr. Tyndall, even Faraday was an Aristotelean, and an Agnostic morethan a materialist. In his \"Faraday, as a Discoverer\" (p. 123) the author shows the great physicist using \"old reflections of Aristotle\"which are \"concisely found in some of his works.\" Faraday, Boscovitch, and all others, however, who see, in the atoms and molecules,\"centres of force,\" and in the corresponding element force, an ENTITY BY ITSELF, are far nearer the truth, perchance, than those,who, denouncing them, denounce at the same time the \"old corpuscular Pythagorean theory\" (one, by the way, which has neverpassed to posterity as the great philosopher really taught it), on the ground of its \"delusion that the conceptual elements of matter canbe grasped as separate and real entities.\"The chief and most fatal mistake and fallacy made by Science, in the view of the Occultists, lies in the idea of the possibility of such athing as inorganic, or dead matter, in nature. Is anything dead or inorganic capable of transformation or change? Occultism asks. Andis there anything under the sun which remains immutable or changeless?This fallacy is nowhere better illustrated than in the scientific work of a German savant, Professor Philip Spiller (Der Weltaether alsKosmische Kraft). In this cosmological treatise, the author attempts to prove that \"no material constituent of a body, no atom, is initself originally endowed with force, but that every such atom is absolutely dead,* and without any power to act at a distance\" (p. 4).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Something dead implies that it had been at some time living. When, at what period of cosmogony? Occultism says that in all caseswhen matter appears inert, it is the most active. A wooden or a stone block is motionless and impenetrable to all intents and purposes.Nevertheless, and de facto, its particles are in ceaseless eternal vibration which is so rapid that to the physical eye the body seemsabsolutely devoid of motion; [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 508 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"This statement, however, does not prevent Spiller from enunciating an occult doctrine and principle. He asserts the independentsubstantiality of force, and shows it as an \"incorporeal stuff\" (unkoerperlicher stoff) or substance. Now substance is not matter inmetaphysics, and for argument's sake it may be granted that it is a wrong expression to use. But this is due to the poverty of Europeanlanguages, and especially to that of scientific terms. Then this \"stuff\" is identified and connected by Spiller with the aether. Expressedin occult language it might be said with more correctness that this \"force-substance\" is the ever-active phenomenal positive aether --prakriti; while the omnipresent all pervading ether is the noumenon of the former, the substratum of all, or Akasa. Nevertheless, Stallofalls foul of Spiller, as he does of the materialists. He is accused of \"utter disregard of the fundamental correlation of force and matter\"(of neither of which Science knows anything certain). For this \"hypostasized half-concept\" is, in the view of all other physicists, not onlyimponderable, but destitute of cohesive, chemical, thermal, electric, and magnetic forces -- of all of which forces -- according tooccultism -- aether is the source and cause.Therefore Spiller, with all his mistakes, exhibits more intuition than any other modern Scientist, with the exception of Dr. Richardson,perhaps, the theorist on the \"nerve force,\" or Nervous Ether, also on \"Sun Force and Earth Force.\"* For AETHER, in Esotericism, is thevery quintessence of all possible energy, and it is certainly to this universal agent (composed of many agents) that all themanifestations of energy in the material, psychic and spiritual worlds are due.What are Electricity and Light, in fact? How can Science know that one is a fluid and the other a \"mode of motion\"? Why is it notmade clear why a difference should be made between them, since both are considered force-correlations. Electricity is a fluid, we aretold, immaterial and non-molecular (though Helmholtz thinks otherwise), and the proof of it is that we can bottle it up, accumulateand store it away. Then, it must be simply matter, and no peculiar \"fluid.\" Nor is it only \"a mode of motion,\" for motion could hardlybe stored in a Leyden jar. As for light, it is a still more extraordinary \"mode of motion;\" since, \"marvellous as it may appear, light (also)can actually be stored up for use,\" as demonstrated by Professor Grove nearly half a century ago.\"Take an engraving which has been kept for some days in the dark, expose it to full sunshine -- that is, insulate it for 15 minutes; lay iton[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] and the spacial distance between those particles in their vibratory motion is -- consideredfrom another plane of being and perception -- as great as that which separates snow flakes or drops of rain.

It is a Force certainly, that fixed the thing, but what is that thing, theresidue of which remains on the paper?Our learned men will get out of this through some scientific technicality; but what is it that is intercepted, so as to imprison a certainquantity of it on glass, paper, or wood? Is it \"Motion\" or is it \"Force\"? Or shall we be told that what remains behind is the effect only ofthe force or Motion? Then what is this Force? Force or energy is a quality; but every quality must belong to a something, or asomebody. In Physics, Force is defined as \"that which changes or tends to change any physical relation between bodies, whethermechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, magnetic, etc.\" But it is not that \"Force\" or that \"Motion\" which remains behind on thepaper, when the Force or Motion has ceased to act; and yet something, which our physical senses cannot perceive, has been left thereto become a cause in its turn and produce effects. What is it? It is not matter, as defined by Science -- i.e., matter in any of its knownstates. An Alchemist would say it was a spiritual secretion -- and would be laughed at. But yet, when the physicist said that Electricity,stored up, was a fluid, or that light fixed on paper is still Sunlight -- this is Science.* In the opinion of an experienced Occultist, onewho has verified the whole series of Nidanas, of causes and effects that finally project their last effect on to this our plane ofmanifestations; one who has traced matter back to its noumenon, the explanation of the physicist is like calling anger, or its effects --the exclamation provoked by it -- a secretion or a fluid, and man, the cause of it -- its material conductor. But, as Grove propheticallyremarked, that day is fast approaching when it will be confessed that the \"forces\" we know of are but the phenomenal manifestationsof realities we know nothing about, -- but which were known to the ancients and -- by them worshipped.He made one still more suggestive remark, however, which ought to have become the motto of Science, but has not. Sir W. Grovesaid that \"SCIENCE SHOULD HAVE NEITHER DESIRES NOR PREJUDICES. TRUTH SHOULD BE HER SOLE AIM.\"Meanwhile, in our days, Scientists are more self-opinionated and bigoted than even the clergy. For they minister to, if they do notactually worship,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The newest Authorities have rejected these explanations as \"exploded theories,\" and have now deified \"Motion\" as their sole Idol.But, surely, they and their idol will one day share the fate of their predecessors."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 510 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"Force-Matter,\" which is their Unknown God. And how unknown it is may be inferred from the many confessions of the most eminentphysicists and biologists, with Faraday at their head. Not only, he said, could he never presume to pronounce whether Force was aproperty or function of Matter, but he actually did not know what was meant by the word matter.There was a time, he added, when he believed he knew something of matter. But the more he lived, and the more carefully hestudied it, the more he became convinced of his utter ignorance of the nature of matter.* (See Buckwell's \"Electric Science.\")The Occultists are often misunderstood because, for lack of better terms, they apply to the essence of Force under certain aspects thedescriptive epithet of substance. Now the names for the varieties of \"substance\" on different planes of perception and being arelegion. Eastern Occultism has a special appellation for each kind; but Science -- like England, in the recollection of a wittyFrenchman, blessed with thirty-six religions and only one fish-sauce -- has but one name for all, namely, \"Substance.\" Moreover,neither the orthodox physicists nor their critics seem to be very certain of their premises, and are as apt to confuse the effects as theydo the causes. It is incorrect, for instance, to say, as Stallo does, that \"matter can no more be realized or conceived as mere spacialpresence than as a concretion of forces,\" or that \"force is nothing without mass, and mass is nothing without force\" -- for one is thenoumenon and the other the phenomenon. Again; Schelling, when saying that \"It is a mere delusion of the phantasy that something,we know not what, remains after we have denuded an object of all the predicates belonging to it\"** -- could never have applied theremark to the realm of transcendental metaphysics. It is true that pure force is nothing in the world of physics; it is ALL in the domainof Spirit. Says Stallo: \"If we reduce the mass upon which a given force, however small, acts to its limit zero -- or, mathematicallyexpressed, until it becomes infinitely small -- the consequence is that the velocity of the resulting motion is infinitely great, and thatthe 'thing' . . . is at any given moment neither here nor there, but everywhere -- that there is no[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This ominous confession was made, we believe, at a Scientific Congress at Swansea. Faraday held a similar opinion, however, asstated by Tyndall: \"What do we know of the atom apart from its force? You imagine a nucleus which may be called a and surround itby forces which may be called m; to my mind the a or nucleus vanishes and the substance consists of the powers m. And, indeed,what notion can we form of the nucleus independent of its powers? What thought remains on which to hang the imagination of an aindependent of the acknowledged forces?\"** Schelling, \"Ideen,\" etc., p. 18.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 511 WHAT IS FORCE?real presence; it is impossible, therefore, to construct matter by a synthesis of forces\" (p. 161).This may be true in the phenomenal world, inasmuch as the illusive reflection of the one reality of the supersensual world mayappear true to the dwarfed conceptions of a materialist. It is absolutely incorrect when the argument is applied to things, in what theKabalists call the supermundane spheres. Inertia, so called, \"is force\" according to Newton (Princ. Def. iii.), and for the student ofEsoteric Sciences the greatest of the occult forces. A body may be considered divorced from its relations with other bodies -- which,according to physical and mechanical sciences, give rise to its attributes -- only conceptually, only on this plane of illusion. In fact, itcan never be so detached: death itself being unable to detach it from its relation with the Universal forces, of which the one FORCE orLIFE is the synthesis: but simply continues such inter-relation on another plane. But what, if Stallo is right, can Dr. James Croll meanwhen, in speaking \"On the Transformation of Gravity\" (Philosophical Magazine, Vol. II., p. 252), he brings forward the viewsadvocated by Faraday, Waterston, and others? For he says very plainly that gravity --\". . . . . is a force pervading Space external to bodies, and that, on the mutual approach of the bodies, the force is not increased, as isgenerally supposed, but the bodies merely pass into a place where the force exists with greater intensity. . . . .\"No one will deny that a force (whether gravity, electricity, or any other force) which exists outside of the bodies and in open space -- beit ether or vacuum -- must be something, and not a pure nothing, when conceived apart from a mass? Otherwise it could hardly existin one place with a greater and in another with reduced \"intensity.\" G. A. Hirn declares the same in his Theorie Mecanique del'Univers. He tries to demonstrate that the atom of the chemists is not an entity of pure convention, or simply an explicative device, butthat it exists really, that its volume is unalterable, and that consequently it is not elastic (!!). \"Force, therefore, is not in the atom; it is inthe space which separates the atoms from each other.\"The above-cited views, expressed by two men of Science of great eminence in their respective countries, show that it is not in theleast unscientific to speak of the substantiality of the so-called Forces. Subject to some future specific name, this force is substance ofsome kind, and can be nothing else; and perhaps one day Science will be the first to re-adopt the derided name of phlogiston.Whatever may be the future name given to it, to maintain that force does not reside in the atoms, but only in \"space between them,\"may be scientific enough; nevertheless it is not true. To the mind of an Occultist it is like saying------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 512 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"that water does not reside in the drops of which the ocean is composed, but only in the space between those drops!The objection made that there are two distinct schools of physicists, by one of which \"the force is assumed to be an independentsubstantial entity, which is NOT a property of matter nor is it essentially related to matter,\"* is hardly likely to help the profane to anyclearer understanding. It is, on the contrary, still more calculated to throw the question into greater confusion than ever. For Force is,then, neither this nor the other. By viewing it as \"an independent substantial entity,\" the theory extends the right hand of fellowship toOccultism, while the strange contradictory idea that it is not related to matter \"otherwise than by its power to act upon it,\"** leadsphysical science to the most absurd contradictory hypotheses. Whether \"force\" or \"motion,\" (Occultism, seeing no difference betweenthe two, never attempts to separate them) it cannot act for the adherents of the atomo-mechanical theory one way, and for those ofthe rival school in another way. Nor can the atoms be, in one case, absolutely uniform in size and weight, and in another, vary in theirweight (Avogadro's law). For, in the words of the same able critic,. . . \"While the absolute equality of the primordial units of mass is thus an essential part of the very foundations of the mechanicaltheory, the whole modern Science of chemistry is based upon a principle directly subversive of it -- a principle of which it has recentlybeen said that 'it holds the same place in chemistry that the law of gravitation does in astronomy.'*** This principle is known as the lawof Avogadro or Ampere.\"****This shows that either modern chemistry or modern physics is entirely wrong in its respective fundamental principles. For if theassumption of atoms of different specific gravities on the basis of the atomic theory in physics is deemed absurd, and chemistry meets,nevertheless, on its opposite basis (in the question of the formation and transformation of chemical compounds) with \"unfailingexperimental verification,\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Concepts of Modern Physics,\" xxxi., Introductory to the 2nd edition.** Loc. cit.*** J. P. Cooke, The New Chemistry, p. 13.**** \"It imports that equal volumes of all substances, when in the gaseous state, and under like conditions of pressure and temperature,contain the same number of molecules -- whence it follows that the weights of the molecules are proportional to the specific gravitiesof the gases; that therefore, these being different, the weights of the molecules are different also; and inasmuch as the molecules ofcertain elementary substances are monatomic (consist of but one atom each) while the molecules of various other substances containthe same number of atoms, that the ultimate atoms of such substances are of different weights\" (Concepts of Modern Physics, p. 34).As shown further on in the same volume, this cardinal principle of modern theoretical chemistry is in utter and irreconcilable conflictwith the first proposition of the atomo-mechanical theory -- namely, the absolute equality of the primordial units of mass.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 513 THEY AGREE TO DISAGREE.then it becomes apparent that it is the atomo-mechanical theory which is untenable. The explanations of the latter, that \"thedifferences of weight are only differences of density, and differences of density are differences of distance between the particlescontained in a given space,\" are not really valid, because, before a physicist can argue in his defence that, \"as in the atom there is nomultiplicity of particles and no void space: hence differences of density or weight are impossible in the case of atoms,\" he must firstknow what an atom is, in reality, and that he cannot know. He must bring it under the observation of at least one of his physical senses-- and that he cannot do: for the simple reason that no one has ever seen, smelt, heard, touched or tasted an \"atom.\" The atombelongs wholly to the domain of metaphysics. It is an entified abstraction -- at any rate for physical Science -- and has nought to dowith physics, strictly speaking, as it can never be brought to the test of retort or balance. The mechanical conception, therefore,becomes a jumble of the most conflicting theories and dilemmas, in the minds of the many Scientists who disagree on this, as onother subjects; the evolution of which the Eastern Occultist, who follows this scientific strife, beholds in the greatest bewilderment.To conclude on the question of gravity. How can Science presume to know anything certain of it? How can it maintain its position andits hypotheses against those of the Occultists, who see in gravity only sympathy and antipathy, or attraction and repulsion, caused byphysical polarity on our terrestrial plane, and by spiritual causes outside of its influence? How can they disagree with the Occultistsbefore they agree among themselves? Indeed one hears of the conservation of energy, and in the same breath of the perfecthardness and inelasticity of the atoms; of the Kinetic theory of gases being identical with \"potential energy,\" so called; and, at thesame time, of the elementary units of mass being absolutely hard and inelastic! An Occultist opens a scientific work and reads asfollows:--\"Physical atomism derives all the qualitative properties of matter from the forms of atomic motion. The atoms themselves remain aselements utterly devoid of property.\" (Wundt, \"Die Theorie der Materie,\" p. 381.)And further:\"Chemistry in its ultimate form must be atomic mechanics.\" (Nazesmann, \"Thermochemie,\" p. 150.)"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"And a moment after he is told that:\"Gases consist of atoms which behave like solid, perfectly elastic spheres.\" (Kroenig, Clausius, Maxwell, etc., Philosophical Magazine,Vol. XIX., p. 18.)Finally, to crown all, Sir W.

(\"Philosophical Magazine,\" p. 321, loc. cit.)But what do the men of true Science say to all this? By the \"men of true Science\" we mean those who care too much for truth and toolittle for their personal vanity to dogmatise on anything, as the majority do. There are several among them -- perhaps more than darepublish openly their secret conclusions for fear of the cry \"Stone him to death!\" -- men, whose intuitions have made them span theabyss that lies between the terrestrial aspect of matter, and the -- to us, on our plane of illusion -- subjective, i.e.,TRANSCENDENTALLY OBJECTIVE SUBSTANCE, and led them to proclaim the existence of the latter. Matter, to the Occultist, itmust be remembered, is that totality of existences in the Kosmos, which falls within any of the planes of possible perception. We arebut too well aware that the orthodox theories of sound, heat and light, are against the occult doctrines. But, it is not enough for themen of Science, or their defenders, to say that they do not deny dynamic power to light and heat; and urge as a proof the fact that Mr.Crookes' radiometer has unsettled no views. If they would fathom the ultimate nature of these Forces, they have first to admit theirsubstantial nature, however supersensuous. Neither do the Occultists deny the correctness of the vibratory theory.* Only they limit itsfunctions to our Earth -- declaring its inadequacy on other planes than ours, since \"Masters\" in the Occult Sciences perceive theCAUSES that produce ethereal vibrations. Were all these only the fictions of the alchemists, or dreams of the Mystics, such men asParacelsus, Philalethes, Van Helmont, and so many others, would have to be regarded as worse than visionaries: they would becomeimpostors and deliberate mystificators.The Occultists are taken to task for calling the Cause of light, heat, sound, cohesion, magnetism, etc., etc., a substance.** Mr. ClerkMaxwell has stated that the pressure of strong sunlight on a square mile is about 3 1/4 lbs. It is, they are told, \"the energy of themyriad ether waves;\" and when they call it a \"substance\" impinging on that area, their explanation is proclaimed unscientific.There is no justification for such an accusation. In no way -- as stated[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Referring to the Aura, one of the Masters says in the \"Occult World,\" \"How could you make yourself understood by, command in fact,those semi-intelligent forces, whose means of communication with us are not through spoken words but through sounds and colours incorrelation between the vibrations of the two.\" It is this \"correlation\" that is unknown to modern Science, yet was many timesexplained by the Alchemists.** The \"substance\" of the Occultist, however, is to the most refined substance of the physicist, what radiant matter is to the leather ofthe Chemist's boots.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 515 THE MYSTIC RAYS.more than once before now -- do the Occultists dispute the explanations of Science, as affording a solution of the immediateobjective agencies at work. Science only errs in believing that, because it has detected in vibratory waves the proximate cause ofthese phenomena, it has, therefore, revealed ALL that lies beyond the threshold of Sense. It merely traces the sequence ofphenomena on a plane of effects, illusory projections from the region that Occultism has long since penetrated. And the lattermaintains that those etheric tremors, are not, as asserted by Science, set up by the vibrations of the molecules of known bodies -- thematter of our terrestrial objective consciousness, -- but that we must seek for the ultimate causes of light, heat, etc., etc., in MATTERexisting in super-sensuous states -- states, however, as fully objective to the spiritual eye of man, as a horse or a tree is to the ordinarymortal. Light and heat are the ghost or shadow of matter in motion. Such states can be perceived by the SEER or the Adept duringthe hours of trance, under the Sushumna ray -- the first of the Seven Mystic rays of the Sun.*Thus, we put forward the Occult teaching which maintains the reality of a supersubstantial and supersensible essence of that Akasa(not ether, which is only an aspect of the latter), the nature of which cannot be inferred from its remoter manifestations -- its merelyphenomenal phalanx of effects -- on this terrene plane. Science, on the contrary, informs us that heat can never be regarded asmatter in any conceivable state.** We are also told that the two great obstacles to the fluid (?) theory of heat undoubtedly are:--[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The names of the Seven Rays -- which are, Sushumna, Harikesa, Viswakarman, Viswatryarchas, Sannaddha, Sarvavasu and Swaraj --are all mystical, and each has its distinct application in a distinct state of consciousness, for occult purposes. The Sushumna, which, as"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"said in the Nirukta (11, 6), is only to light up the moon, is the ray nevertheless cherished by the initiated Yogis. The totality of theSeven Rays spread through the Solar system constitute, so to say, the physical Upadhi (basis) of the Ether of Science; in whichUpadhi, light, heat, electricity, etc., etc., -- the forces of orthodox science -- correlate to produce their terrestrial effects. As psychic andspiritual effects, they emanate from, and have their origin in, the supra-solar Upadhi, in the ether of the Occultist -- or Akasa.** To cite a most impartial critic, one whose authority no one can call in question, as a reminder to Western Dogmatists, that thequestion cannot be in any way considered as settled: \"There is no fundamental difference between light and heat . . . each is merelya metamorphosis of the other. . . . Heat is light in complete repose. Light is heat in rapid motion. Directly light is combined with abody, it becomes heat; but when it is thrown off from that body it again becomes light.\" (Leslie's Fluid Theory of Light and Heat.)\"Whether this is true or false we cannot tell, and many years, perhaps many generations, will have to elapse before we shall be ableto tell.\" (Buckle's History of Civilization, Vol. III., p. 384.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 516 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(1.) The production of heat by friction -- excitation of molecular motions.(2.) The conversion of heat into mechanical motion.The answer given is: There are fluids of various kinds. Electricity is called a fluid, and so was heat quite recently, but it was on thesupposition that heat was some imponderable substance. This was during the supreme and autocratic reign of matter. When the latterwas dethroned, and MOTION was proclaimed the sole sovereign ruler of the Universe, heat became \"a mode of motion.\" We need notdespair: it may become something else to-morrow. Like the Universe itself, Science is ever becoming, and can never say, \"I am that Iam.\" On the other hand, Occult Science has its changeless traditions from prehistoric times. It may err in particulars; it can neverbecome guilty of a mistake in questions of Universal laws, simply because that Science, justly referred to by philosophy as the\"divine,\" was born on higher planes, and was brought on Earth by beings who were wiser than man will be, even in the seventh Raceof his Seventh Round. And that Science maintains that Forces are not what modern learning would have them; e.g., Magnetism is nota \"mode of motion\"; and, in this particular case, at least, exact \"modern Science\" is sure to come to grief some day. Nothing, at thefirst blush, can appear more ridiculous, more outrageously absurd than to say, for instance: \"the Hindu initiated Yogi knows really tentimes more than the greatest European physicist of the ultimate nature and constitution of light -- both solar and lunar.\" Yet why is theSushumna ray believed to be that ray which furnishes the moon with its borrowed light? Why is it \"the ray cherished by the initiatedYogi?\" Why is the moon held as the deity of the mind, by those Yogis? We say, because light, or rather all its occult properties, everycombination and correlation of it with other forces, mental, psychic, and spiritual, were perfectly known to the old adepts.Therefore, although, in its knowledge of the ultimate constitution of matter, or in the so-called ultimate analysis as opposed to theproximate in chemistry, occult science may be less well-informed as to the behaviour of compound elements in various cases ofphysical correlations: still, it is immeasurably higher in its knowledge of the ultimate occult states of matter, and of the true nature ofmatter, than all the physicists and chemists of our modern day put together.Now, if we state the truth openly and in full sincerity, namely, that the ancient Initiates had a far wider knowledge of physics -- as aScience of Nature -- than our Academies of Science, all taken together, possess, the statement will be characterized as animpertinence and an absurdity; for physical sciences are considered to have been carried in our age to the apex of perfection. Hence,the twitting query -- \"Can------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 517 THE CAUSES AND THE EFFECTS.the Occultists meet successfully the two points, namely (a) the production of heat by friction -- excitation of molecular motions; and (b)the conversion of heat into mechanical force, if they hold to the old \"exploded\" theory of heat being a substance or a fluid?\"To answer the question, it must first be observed that the Occult Sciences do not regard either electricity or any of the forces supposedto be generated by it, as matter, in any of the states known to physical Science; to put it more clearly, none of these \"forces,\" so-called, are either solids, gases, or fluids. If it did not look pedantic, an Occultist would even object to electricity being called a fluid --as it is an effect and not a cause. But its noumenon, he would say, is a conscious cause. The same in the cases of \"Force\" and the\"Atom.\" Let us see what an eminent Academician, Butlerof, the chemist, had to say about these two abstractions.--------------\"What is Force?\" argues this great man of Science, \"what is it from a strictly scientific stand-point, and as warranted by the law ofconservation of energy? Conceptions of Force are resumed by our conceptions of this, that, or another mode of motion.\" Force is thussimply the passage of one state of motion into another state of the same: of electricity, into heat and light, of heat into sound or somemechanical function, and so on.* The first time electric fluid was produced by man on earth it must have been by friction; hence, aswell-known, it is heat that produces it by disturbing its laya state,** and electricity exists no more on earth per se than heat or light, orany other force. They are all correlations, as science says. \"When a given quantity of heat, assisted by a steam engine, is transformedinto mechanical work, we speak of steam power (or force). When a falling body strikes an obstacle in its way, thereby generating heatand sound -- we call it the power of collision. When electricity decomposes water or heats a platinum wire, we speak of the force of theelectric fluid. When the rays of the sun are intercepted by the thermometer bulb and its quicksilver expands, we speak of the calorificenergy of the sun. In short, when one state of a determined quantity of motion ceases, another state of motion equivalent to the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"preceding takes its place, and the result of such a transformation or correlation is -- force. In all cases where such a transformation, orthe passage of one state of motion into another, is entirely absent, there no force is possible. Let us admit for a moment an absolutelyhomogeneous state of the Universe, and our conception of force falls down to nought.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* On the plane of manifestation and illusionary matter it may be so; not that it is nothing more, for it is vastly more.** Neutral, or zero.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 518 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"Therefore it becomes evident that the force, which materialism considers as the cause of the diversity that surrounds us, is in soberreality only an effect, a result of that diversity. From such point of view force is not the cause of motion, but a result, while the cause ofthat force, or forces, is not the substance or matter, but motion itself. Matter thus must be laid aside and with it the basic principle ofmaterialism, which has become unnecessary, as force brought down to a state of motion can give no idea of the substance. If force isthe result of motion, then it becomes incomprehensible why that motion should become witness to matter and not to Spirit or aSpiritual essence. True, our reason cannot conceive of a motion minus something moving (and our reason is right); but the nature oresse of that something moving remains to Science entirely unknown; and the Spiritualist, in such case, has as much right to attribute itto a \"Spirit,\" as a Materialist to creative and all-potential matter. A Materialist has no special privileges in this instance, nor can heclaim any. The law of the conservation of energy, as thus seen, is shown to be illegitimate in its pretensions and claims in this case.The \"great dogma\" -- no force without matter and no matter without force -- falls to the ground, and loses entirely the solemnsignificance with which materialism has tried to invest it. The conception of force still gives no idea of matter and compels us in noway to see in it \"the origin of all origins.\" (\"Scientific Letters,\" Professor Butlerof.)We are assured that real science is not materialistic; and our own conviction tells us that it cannot be so, when its learning is real.There is a good reason for it, well defined by some physicists and chemists themselves. Natural sciences cannot go hand in hand withmaterialism. To be at the height of their calling, men of science have to reject the very possibility of materialistic doctrines havingaught to do with the atomic theory; and we find that Lange, Butlerof, Du Bois Reymond, -- the latter probably unconsciously -- andseveral others, have proved it. And it is, furthermore, demonstrated by the fact, that Kanada in India, and Leucippus, Democritus, andafter them Epicurus -- the earliest atomists in Europe -- while propagating their doctrine of definite proportions, believed in Gods orsupersensuous entities, at the same time. Their ideas upon matter thus differed from those now prevalent. We must be allowed tomake our statement clearer in a short synopsis of the ancient and modern views of philosophy upon atoms, and thus prove that theatomic theory kills Materialism.From the standpoint of Materialism, which reduces the beginnings of all to matter, the Universe consists, in its fullness, of atoms andvacuity. Even leaving aside the axiom -- now absolutely demonstrated by telescope and microscope -- taught by the ancients, thatnature abhors------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 519 THE VICIOUS CIRCLE.vacuum, what is an atom? \"It is, we are answered by Science,\" writes Professor Butlerof, \"the limited division of substance, theindivisible particle of matter. To admit the divisibility of the atom, amounts to an admission of an infinite divisibility of substance,which is equivalent to reducing substance to nihil, a nothingness. Owing to a feeling of self-preservation alone, materialism cannotadmit infinite divisibility; otherwise, it would have to bid farewell for ever to its basic principle and thus sign its own death-warrant.\"Buchner, for instance, like a true dogmatist in materialism, declares that \"to accept infinite divisibility is absurd, and amounts todoubting the very existence of matter.\" The Atom is indivisible then, saith Materialism? Very well.\"See now what a curious contradiction this fundamental principle of the materialists is leading them into,\" writes Butlerof. \"The atomis indivisible, and at the same time we know it to be elastic. An attempt to deprive it of elasticity is unthinkable; it would amount to anabsurdity. Absolutely non-elastic atoms could never exhibit a single one of those numerous phenomena that are attributed to theircorrelations. Without any elasticity, the atoms could not manifest their energy, and the substance of the materialists would remainweeded of every force. Therefore, if the Universe is composed of atoms, then those atoms must be elastic. It is here that we meet withan insuperable obstacle. For, what are the conditions requisite for the manifestation of elasticity? An elastic ball, when striking againstan obstacle, is flattened and contracts, which it would be impossible for it to do, were not that ball to consist of particles, the relativeposition of which experiences at the time of the blow a temporary change. This may be said of elasticity in general; no elasticity ispossible without change with respect to the position of the compound particles of an elastic body. This means that the elastic body ischangeful and consists of particles, or, in other words, that elasticity can pertain only to those bodies that are divisible. And the atomis elastic.\"This is sufficient to show how absurd are the simultaneous admissions of the non-divisibility and elasticity of the atom. The atom iselastic, ergo, the atom is divisible, and must consist of particles, or of sub-atoms. And these sub-atoms? They are either non-elastic,and in such case they represent no dynamic importance, or, they are elastic also; and in that case, they, too, are subject to divisibility.And thus ad infinitum. But infinite divisibility of atoms resolves matter into simple centres of force, i.e., precludes the possibility ofconceiving matter as an objective substance."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"This vicious circle is fatal to materialism. It finds itself caught in its own nets, and no issue is possible for it out of the dilemma. If itsays that the atom is indivisible, then it will have mechanics asking it the awkward question: \"How does the Universe move in this case,and how do its forces correlate? A world built on absolutely non-elastic atoms, is like an engine without steam, it is doomed to eternalinertia.\"*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Scientific Letters,\" Butlerof.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 520 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Accept the explanations and teachings of Occultism, and, the blind inertia of physical Science being replaced by the intelligentactive Powers behind the veil of matter, motion and inertia become subservient to those Powers. It is on the doctrine of the illusivenature of matter, and the infinite divisibility of the atom, that the whole science of Occultism is built. It opens limitless horizons tosubstance informed by the divine breath of its soul in every possible state of tenuity, states still undreamt of by the most spirituallydisposed chemists and physicists.The above views were enunciated by an Academician, the greatest chemist in Russia, and a recognised authority even in Europe --the late Professor Butlerof. True, he was defending the phenomena of the Spiritualists, the materializations, so called, in which hebelieved as Professors Zollner, and Hare did, as Mr. A. Russell Wallace, Mr. W. Crookes, and many another Fellow of the RoyalSociety, do still, whether openly or secretly. But his argument with regard to the nature of the essence that acts behind the physicalphenomena of light, heat, electricity, etc., is no less scientific and authoritative for all that, and apply admirably to the case in hand.Science has no right to deny to the Occultists their claim to a more profound knowledge of the so-called Forces; which, they say, areonly the effects of causes generated by Powers, substantial, yet supersensuous, and beyond any kind of matter with which they (theScientists) have hitherto become acquainted. The most science can do is to assume the attitude of agnosticism and to maintain it.Then it can say: \"Your case is no more proven than is ours; but we confess to knowing nothing in reality either about Force or matter,or that which lies at the bottom of the so-called correlations of Forces. Therefore, time alone can prove who is right and who is wrong.Let us wait patiently, and meanwhile show courtesy instead of scoffing at each other.\"But to do this requires a boundless love of truth and the surrender of that prestige -- however false -- of infallibility, which the men ofScience have acquired among the ignorant and flippant, though cultured, masses of the profane. To blend the two sciences, thearchaic and the modern, requires first of all the abandonment of the actual materialistic lines. It necessitates a kind of religiousmysticism and even the study of old magic, which our Academicians will never take up. The necessity is easily explained. Just as inold alchemical works the real meaning of the substances and elements meant are concealed under the most ridiculous metaphors, soare the physical, psychic, and spiritual natures of the Elements (say of fire) concealed in the Vedas, and especially in the Puranas,under allegories comprehensible only to the Initiates. Had they no meaning, then indeed all those long legends and allegories aboutthe sacredness of the three types of fire, and the forty-nine original fires --------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 521 CHEMICAL GODS.personified by the Sons of Daksha's daughters and the Rishis, their husbands, \"who with the first son of Brahma and his threedescendants constitute the forty-nine fires\" -- would be idiotic verbiage and no more. But it is not so. Every fire has a distinct functionand meaning in the worlds of the physical and the spiritual. It has, moreover, in its essential nature a corresponding relation to one ofthe human psychic faculties, besides its well determined chemical and physical potencies when coming in contact with theterrestrially differentiated matter. Science has no speculations to offer upon fire per se; Occultism and ancient religious science have.This is shown even in the meagre and purposely veiled phraseology of the Puranas, where (as in the Vayu Purana) many of thequalities of the personified fires are explained. Thus, Pavaka is electric, or Vaidyuta, fire; Pavamana, the fire produced by friction, (orNirmathya): and Suchi is solar (or Saura) fire* -- all these three being the sons of Abhimanin, the Agni (fire), eldest son of Brahma andof Swaha. Pavaka, moreover, is made parent to Kavyavahana, the fire of the Pitris: Suchi to Havyavahana -- the fire of the gods; andPavamana, to Saharaksha, the fire of the Asuras. Now all this shows that the writers of the Puranas were perfectly conversant with the\"Forces\" of Science and their correlations; moreover, with the various qualities of the latter in their bearing upon those psychic andphysical phenomena which receive no credit and are unknown to physical science now. Very naturally, when an Orientalist, --especially one with materialistic tendencies -- reads that these are only appellations of fire employed in the invocations and rituals,he calls this \"Tantrika superstition and mystification\"; and he becomes more careful to avoid errors in spelling, than to give attentionto the secret meaning attached to the personifications, or to seek their explanation in the physical correlations of forces, so far asknown. So little credit, indeed, is given to the ancient Aryans for knowledge, that even such glaring passages as in Book I. chap. ii,Vishnu Purana, are left without any notice. Nevertheless, what can this sentence mean? -- \"Then Ether, air, light, water, and earth,severally united with the properties of sound and other qualities, existed as distinguishable according to their properties, . . . . butpossessing many and various energies and being unconnected, they could not, without combination, create living beings, not havingblended with each other. . . . Having combined . . . they assumed through mutual association, the character of one mass of entireunity; and directed by Spirit . . .\" etc. This means, of course, that the writers were perfectly acquainted with correlation and were wellposted about the origin of Kosmos from the \"undiscrete Principle\" -- Avyaktanugrahena, as applied[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Called the \"drinker of waters,\" solar heat causing water to evaporate."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 522 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.to Parabrahmam and Mulaprakriti conjointly, and not to \"Avyakta, either First Cause, or matter,\" as Wilson gives it. The old Initiatesknew of no \"miraculous creation,\" but taught the evolution of atoms (on our physical plane), and their first differentiation from layainto the protyle, as Mr. Crookes has suggestively named matter, or primordial substance beyond the zero-line:-- there where we placeMulaprakriti, the \"root-Principle\" of the world stuff and of all in the world.This can be easily demonstrated. Take, for instance, the newly-published catechism of the Visishtadwaita Vedantins, an orthodox andexoteric system, yet fully enunciated and taught in the XIth century (its founder, Ramanujacharya, being born in A.D. 1017), at a timewhen European \"Science\" still believed in the squareness and flatness of the Earth, of Cosmas-Indicopleustes of the VIth century. Itteaches that before evolution began, Prakriti (Nature) was in a condition of laya or absolute homogeneity, as \"matter exists in twoconditions, the sukshma, or latent and undifferentiated, and the sthula or differentiated condition.\" Then it became anu, atomic. Itteaches of Sudda-satwa -- \"a substance not subject to the qualities of matter, from which it is quite different,\" and adds that out of thatsubstance the bodies of the inhabitants of Vaikuntaloka (the heaven of Vishnu), the gods, are formed. That every particle or atom ofPrakriti contains Jiva (divine life), and is the sarira (body) of that Jiva which it contains, while every Jiva is in its turn the sarira of thesupreme spirit, as \"Parabrahm pervades every Jiva, as well as every particle of matter.\" Dualistic and anthropomorphic as may be thephilosophy of the Visishtadwaita, when compared with that of the Adwaita -- the non-dualists, -- it is yet supremely higher in logic andphilosophy than the cosmogony accepted by either Christianity, or its great opponent, modern Science. The followers of one of thegreatest minds that ever appeared on Earth, the Adwaita Vedantins are called Atheists, because they regard all save Parabrahm, thesecondless, or Absolute Reality -- as an illusion. Yet the wisest Initiates came from their ranks, as also the greatest Yogis. TheUpanishads show that they most assuredly knew not only what is the causal substance in the effects of friction, and that theirforefathers were acquainted with the conversion of heat into mechanical force, but that they were acquainted with the noumena ofevery spiritual as well as of every cosmic phenomenon.Truly the young Brahmin who graduates in the universities and colleges of India with the highest honours; who starts in life as an M.A.and an LL.B., with a tail initialed from Alpha to Omega after his name, and a contempt for his national gods proportioned to thehonours received in his education in physical sciences; truly he has but to read in the light of the latter, and with an eye to thecorrelation of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 523 SUGGESTIVE ALLEGORIES.physical Forces, certain passages in his Puranas, if he would learn how much more his ancestors knew than he will ever know -- unlesshe becomes an occultist. Let him turn to the allegory of Pururavas and the celestial Gandharva,* who furnished the former with avessel full of heavenly fire. The primeval mode of obtaining fire by friction has its scientific explanation in the Vedas, and is pregnantwith meaning for him who reads between the lines. The Tretagni (sacred triad of fires) obtained by the attrition of sticks made of thewood of the Aswattha tree (the Bo-tree, of Wisdom and Knowledge) -- sticks \"as many finger-breaths long as there are syllables in thegayatri\" must have a secret meaning, or else the writers of the Vedas and Puranas were no sacred writers but mystificators. That it hassuch a meaning, the Hindu Occultists are a proof, and they alone are able to enlighten Science, as to why and how, \"the fire, that wasprimevally one, was made threefold (treta) in our present Manvantara, by the Son of Ila (Vach), the primeval woman after the Deluge,the wife and daughter of Vaivasvata Manu. The allegory is suggestive, in whatever Purana it may be read and studied.--------------VII.AN ATTACK ON THE SCIENTIFIC THEORY OF FORCE BY A MAN OF SCIENCE.THE wise words of several (English) men of Science have now to be quoted in our favour. Ostracised for \"principle's sake\" by the few,they are tacitly approved of by the many. That one of them preaches almost Occult doctrines, in some things identical with, and oftenamounting to a public recognition of our \"Fohat and his seven Sons\" --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Gandharva of the Veda is the deity who knows and reveals the secrets of heaven and divine truths to mortals. Cosmically -- theGandharvas are the aggregate powers of the solar-fire, and constitute its Forces; psychically -- the intelligence residing in theSushumna, Solar ray, the highest of the seven rays; mystically -- the occult force in the Soma (the moon, or lunar plant) and the drinkmade of it; physically -- the phenomenal, and spiritually -- the noumenal causes of Sound and the \"Voice of Nature.\" Hence, they arecalled the 6,333 \"heavenly Singers\" and musicians of Indra's loka who personify (even in number) the various and manifold sounds inNature, both above and below. In the latter allegories they are said to have mystic power over women, and to be fond of them. Theesoteric meaning is plain. They are one of the forms, if not the prototypes, of Enoch's angels, the Sons of God, who saw that thedaughters of men were fair (Gen. vi.) who married them, and taught the daughters of the Earth the secrets of Heaven.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 524 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Occult Gandharva of the Vedas -- will be recognised by every Occultist, and even by some profane readers."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"If the latter open Volume V. of the Popular Science Review (pp. 329-334), they will find in it an article on \"Sun Force and EarthForce,\" by Dr. B. W. Richardson, F.R.S., which reads as follows:--\"At this moment, when the theory of mere motion as the origin of all varieties of force is again becoming the prevailing thought, itwere almost heresy to re-open a debate, which for a period appears, by general consent, to be virtually closed; but I accept the risk,and shall state, therefore, what were the precise views of the immortal heretic, whose name I have whispered to the readers, (SamuelMetcalfe), respecting Sun Force. Starting with the argument on which nearly all physicists are agreed, that there exist in nature twoagencies -- matter which is ponderable, visible, and tangible, and a something which is imponderable, invisible, and appreciableonly by its influence on matter -- Metcalfe maintains that the imponderable and active agency which he calls 'caloric' is not a mereform of motion, not a vibration amongst the particles of ponderable matter, but itself a material substance flowing from the Sunthrough Space,* filling the voids between the particles of solid bodies, and conveying by sensation the property called heat. Thenature of caloric, or Sun-Force, is contended for by him on the following grounds:--\"(i.) That it may be added to, and abstracted from other bodies and measured with mathematical precision.\"(ii.) That it augments the volume of bodies, which are again reduced in size by its abstraction.\"(iii.) That it modifies the forms, properties, and conditions of all other bodies.\"(iv.) That it passes by radiation through the most perfect vacuum** that can be formed, in which it produces the same effects on thethermometer as in the atmosphere.\"(v.) That it exerts mechanical and chemical forces which nothing can restrain, as in volcanoes, the explosion of gunpowder, andother fulminating compounds.\"(vi.) That it operates in a sensible manner on the nervous system, producing intense pain; and when in excess, disorganization of thetissues.\"As against the vibratory theory, Metcalfe further argues that if caloric were a mere property or quality, it could not augment thevolume of other bodies; for this purpose it must itself have volume, it must occupy space, and it must, therefore, be a material agent.If caloric were only the effect of vibratory motion amongst the particles of ponderable matter, it could not radiate from hot bodieswithout the simultaneous transition of the vibrating particles; but the fact stands out that heat can radiate from material ponderablesubstance without[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Not only \"through space,\" but filling every point of our solar system, for it is the physical residue, so to say, of Ether, its lining on ourplane; Ether having to serve other cosmic and terrestrial purposes besides being the \"agent\" for transmitting light.

RICHARDSON'S HERESY.loss of weight of such substance. . . . With this view as to the material nature of caloric or sun-force; with the impression firmly fixed onhis mind that 'everything in Nature is composed of two descriptions of matter, the one essentially active and ethereal, the otherpassive and motionless,'* Metcalfe based the hypothesis that the Sun-force, or caloric, is a Self-active principle. For its own particles,he holds, it has repulsion; for the particles of all ponderable matter it has affinity; it attracts the particles of ponderable matter withforces which vary inversely as the squares of the distance. It thus acts through ponderable matter. If universal space were filled withcaloric, sun-force, alone (without ponderable matter), caloric would also be inactive and would constitute a boundless Ocean ofpowerless or quiescent ether, because it would then have nothing on which to act, while ponderable matter, however inactive of itself,has 'certain properties by which it modifies and controls the actions of caloric, both of which are governed by immutable laws thathave their origin in the mutual relations and specific properties of each.'\"And he lays down a law which he believes is absolute, and which is thus expressed:--\" 'By the attraction of caloric for ponderable matter, it unites and holds together all things; by its self-repulsive energy it separates andexpands all things.' \"This, of course, is almost the occult explanation of cohesion. Dr. Richardson continues:--\"As I have already said, the tendency of modern teaching is to rest upon the hypothesis . . . that heat is motion, or, as it would,perhaps, be better stated, a specific force or form of motion.**\"But this hypothesis, popular as it is, is not one that ought to be accepted to the exclusion of the simpler views of the material natureof sun-force, and of its influence in modifying the conditions of matter.

It pervades and fills space, but alone it too is quiescent -- dead.**We bring together the two elements, the inert matter, the self-repulsive Ether (?) and thereupon dead (?) ponderable matter isvivified\"; [Ponderable matter may be inert but never dead -- this is Occult Law. -- H.P.B.] . . . \"through the particles of the ponderablesubstance the ether [Ether's second principle. -- H.P.B.] penetrates, and, so penetrating, it combines with the ponderable particles andholds them in mass, holds them together in bond of union; they are dissolved in the Ether.\"\"This distribution of solid ponderable matter through ether extends, according to the theory before us, to everything that exists at thismoment. The ether is all-pervading. The human body itself is charged with the ether [Say astral light. -- H.P.B.]; its minute particlesare held together by it; the plant is in the same condition; the most solid earth, rock, adamant, crystal, metal, all are the same. Butthere are differences in the capacities of different kinds of ponderable matter to receive sun-force, and upon this depends the variouschanging conditions of matter; the solid, the liquid, the gaseous condition. Solid bodies have attracted caloric in excess over fluidbodies, and hence their firm cohesion; when a portion of molten zinc is poured upon a plate of solid zinc, the molten zinc becomesas solid because there is a rush of caloric from the liquid to the solid, and in the equalization the particles, previously loose or liquid,are more closely brought together. . . . Metcalfe himself, dwelling on the above-named phenomena, and accounting for them by theunity of principle of action, which has already been explained, sums up his argument in very clear terms, in a comment on thedensities of various bodies. 'Hardness and softness' (he says), 'solidity and liquidity, are not essential conditions of bodies, but dependon the relative proportions of ethereal and ponderable matter of which they are composed. The most elastic gas may be reduced tothe liquid form by the abstraction of caloric, and again converted into a firm solid, the particles of which would cling together with aforce proportional to their augmented affinity for caloric. On the other hand, by adding a sufficient quantity of the same principle tothe densest metals, their attraction for it is diminished when they are expanded into the gaseous state, and their cohesion isdestroyed.' \"Having thus quoted at length the heterodox views of the great \"heretic\" -- views that need only a little alteration of terms here andthere, the same eminent scientist -- an original and liberal thinker, undeniably -- proceeds to sum up those views, and continues:--[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Yet it is not Ether, but only one of the principles of Ether, the latter being itself one of the principles of Akasa.** And so does prana (Jiva) pervade the whole living body of man; but alone, without having an atom to act upon, it would bequiescent -- dead; i.e., would be in laya, or as Mr. Crookes has it, \"locked in protyle.\" It is the action of Fohat upon a compound oreven a simple body that produces life. When a body dies it passes into the same polarity as its male energy and repels therefore theactive agent, which, losing hold of the whole, fastens on the parts or molecules, this action being called chemical.

Let us remember that this AEther, whether Akasa is meant by theterm, or its lower principle, Ether -- is septenary. Akasa is Aditi in the allegory, and the mother of Martanda (the sun), the Deva-matri --\"Mother of the gods.\" In the solar system, the sun is her Buddhi and Vahan, the Vehicle, hence the 6th principle; in Kosmos all thesuns are the Kama rupa of Akasa and so is ours.

Atoms, Ether, or both, modern speculation cannot get out of the circle of ancient thought; and the latter wassoaked through with archaic occultism. Undulatory or corpuscular theory -- it is all one. It is speculation from the aspects ofphenomena, not from the knowledge of the essential nature of the cause and causes. When modern Science has explained to itsaudience the late achievements of Bunsen and Kirchoff, and shown the seven colours, the \"primary\" of a ray which is decomposed ina fixed order on a screen; and described the respective lengths of luminous waves, what has it proved? It has justified its reputation forexactness in mathematical achievement by measuring even the length of a luminous wave -- \"varying from about seven hundred andsixty millionths of a millimetre at the red end of the spectrum to about three hundred and ninety-three millionths of a millimetre at theviolet end.\" But when the exactness of the calculation with regard to the effect on the light-wave is thus vindicated, Science is forcedto admit that the force (which is the supposed cause) is believed to produce \"inconceivably minute undulations\" in some medium --\"generally regarded as identical with the ethereal medium\"** -- and that medium itself is still only -- a \"hypothetical agent!\"Auguste Comte's pessimism with respect to the impossibility of knowing some day the chemical composition of the sun, has not beenbelied thirty years later by Kirchoff, as claimed. The spectroscope has helped us to see that the elements, with which the modernchemist is familiar, must in all probability be present in the sun's outward robes -- not in the sun itself; and, taking these \"robes,\" thesolar cosmic veil, for the sun itself, the physicists have declared its luminosity to be due to combustion and flame, and have mistakenthe vital principle of that luminary for a purely material thing, and called it \"chromosphere.\"*** We have hypotheses and theories onlyso far, not law -- by any means.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Brutal but frank materialism is more honest than Janus-faced agnosticism in our days. Monism is the Pecksniff of modern philosophy,turning a pharisaical face to psychology and idealism, and its natural face of a Roman Augur, swelling his cheek with his tongue -- toMaterialism. The Monists are worse than the Materialists; because, while looking at the Universe and psycho-spiritual man from thesame negative stand-point, the latter put their case far less plausibly than sceptics of Mr. Tyndall's or even Mr. Huxley's stamp.

It mayanswer scientific hypotheses very well, but the question is whether it answers as well to truth, and represents a fact in nature. Attractionby itself is not sufficient to explain merely planetary motion; how can it presume to explain the rotatory motion in the infinitudes ofSpace? Attraction alone will never fill all the gaps, unless a special impulse is admitted for every sidereal body, and the rotation ofevery planet with its satellites is shown to be due to some one cause combined with attraction. And even then, says an astronomer(\"Philosophie Naturelle,\" art. 142), Science would have to name that cause.Occultism has named it for ages, and so have all the ancient philosophers; but then all such beliefs are now proclaimed explodedsuperstitions. The \"extra cosmic\" God has killed every possibility of belief in intra cosmic intelligent Forces, yet who, or what is theoriginal pusher in that motion? \"When we have learned the cause, unique et speciale, that pushes, we will be ready to combine itwith the one which attracts,\" says Francoeur (\"Astronomie,\" p. 342). And again -- \"Attraction between the celestial bodies is onlyrepulsion: it is the Sun that drives them incessantly onward; for otherwise, their motion would stop.\"If ever this theory of the Sun-Force being the primal cause of all life on earth and motion in heaven is accepted, and if that other farbolder one of Herschell -- about certain organisms in the Sun -- is accepted even as a provisional hypothesis, then will our teachingsbe vindicated, and esoteric allegory shown to have anticipated Modern Science by millions of years, probably, for these are theArchaic teachings. Martanda (the Sun) watches and threatens -- without abandoning the central position to which his Mother, Aditi,relegated him -- his seven brothers, the planets; \"he pursues them, turning slowly around himself . . . and follows them from afar,moving in the same direction that they do, on the path that encircles their houses\" -- or the orbit. (See Comment to Stanza IV., BookI.) It is the Sun-fluids or Emanations that impart all motion and awaken all into life, in the Solar System.

These laws are immutable; but themotion of all the bodies, which motion is diverse and alters with every minor Kalpa -- is regulated by the Movers, the Intelligenceswithin the Cosmic Soul. Are we so very wrong in believing all this? Well, here is a modern and a great man of Science who, speakingof vital electricity, uses language far more akin to Occultism than to modern materialistic thought. We refer the sceptical reader to anarticle on \"The Source of Heat in the Sun,\" by Robert Hunt, F.R.S., (in \"Popular Science Review,\" Vol. IV., p. 148), who, speaking ofthe luminous envelope of the Sun and its \"peculiar curdy appearance,\" says:--\"Arago proposed that this envelope should be called the Photosphere, a name now generally adopted. By the elder Herschell, thesurface of this photosphere was compared to mother-of-pearl. . . . . It resembles the Ocean on a tranquil summer-day, when its surfaceis slightly crisped by a gentle breeze. . . . Mr. Nasmyth has discovered a more remarkable condition than any that had previously beensuspected . . . objects which are peculiarly lens-shaped . . . . like 'willow leaves' . . . . different in size . . . . . not arranged in any ordercrossing each other in all directions . . . . . with an irregular motion among themselves . . . . . . . They are seen approaching to andreceding from each other, and sometimes assuming new angular positions, so that the appearance . . . . . has been compared to adense shoal of fish, which, indeed, they resemble in shape. . . . The size of these objects gives a grand idea of the gigantic scaleupon which physical (?) operations are carried out in the Sun. They cannot be less than 1,000 miles in length, and from two to threehundred miles in breadth. The most probable conjecture which has been offered respecting those leaf or lens-like objects, is that thephotosphere* is an immense ocean of gaseous matter (what kind of \"matter?\") . . . in a state of intense (apparent) incandescence, andthat they are perspective projections of the sheets of flame. . . .\"Solar \"flames\" seen through telescopes are reflections, says Occultism. But see what Occultists have to say to this in Book I.\"Whatever they may be (those sheets of flame), it is evident they are the immediate sources of solar heat and light. Here we have asurrounding envelope of photogenic matter,** which pendulates with mighty energies, and by communicating its motion to theethereal medium in stellar space, produces heat and light in far distant worlds. We have said that those forms have been compared tocertain organisms, and Herschell says, 'Though it would be too daring to speak of such organizations as partaking of life [why not?],***yet we do not know that vital action is competent to develop heat, light, and electricity.' . . . Can it be that there is truth in this finethought? May the pulsing of vital matter[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* And the central mass, too, as will be found, or rather the centre of the reflection.** That \"matter\" is just like the reflection in a mirror of the flame from a \"photogenic\" lamp-wick."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"*** See \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" p. 258 -- answer to this speculation of Herschell's.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 531 SUN-FORCE AND EARTH-FORCE.in the central Sun of our System be the source of all that life which crowds the earth, and without doubt overspreads the other planets,to which the Sun is the mighty Minister?\" . . .Occultism answers these queries in the affirmative; and Science will find this to be the case, one day.Again, on p. 156, Mr. Hunt writes:--\"But regarding Life -- Vital Force -- as a power far more exalted than either light, heat, or electricity, and indeed capable of exerting acontrolling power over them all\" (this is absolutely occult). . . . . \"we are certainly disposed to view with satisfaction that speculationwhich supposes the photosphere to be the primary seat of vital power, and to regard with a poetic pleasure that hypothesis whichrefers the Solar energies to Life.\"Thus, we have an important scientific corroboration for one of our fundamental dogmas -- namely, that (a) the Sun is the store-houseof Vital Force, which is the Noumenon of Electricity; and (b) that it is from its mysterious, never-to-be-fathomed depths, that issue thoselife currents which thrill through Space, as through the organisms of every living thing on Earth. For see what another eminentphysician says, who calls this (our life-fluid) \"nervous Ether.\" Change a few sentences in the article, extracts from which now follow,and you have another quasi-Occult treatise on Life Force. This once, it is again Dr. B. W. Richardson, F.R.S., who gives his views inthe \"Popular Science Review,\" Vol. X., p. 380-3, on \"Nervous Ether,\" as he has on \"Sun-Force\" and \"Earth-Force\":--\"The idea attempted to be conveyed by the theory is, that between the molecules of the matter, solid or fluid, of which the nervousorganisms, and, indeed, of which all the organic parts of a body are composed, there exists a refined subtle medium, vaporous orgaseous, which holds the molecules in a condition for motion upon each other, and for arrangement and rearrangement of form; amedium by and through which all motion is conveyed; by and through which the one organ or part of the body is held in communionwith the other parts, by which and through which the outer living world communicates with the living man: a medium, which, beingpresent, enables the phenomena of life to be demonstrated, and which, being universally absent, leaves the body actually dead. . . . ..\"And the whole Solar System falls into Pralaya -- the author might have added. But let us read further:. . . \"I use the word Ether in its general sense as meaning a very light, vaporous or gaseous matter; I use it, in short, as the astronomeruses it when he speaks of the Ether of Space, by which he means a subtle but material medium. . . . . When I speak of a nervousEther, I do not convey that the ether is existent in nervous structure only: I believe truly that it is a special part of the nervousorganization; but, as nerves pass into all structures that have capacities for movement and sensibilities, so the nervous ether passesinto all such parts; and as the nervous ether is, according to my view, a direct product from blood, so we may look upon it as a part ofthe atmosphere of the blood.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 532 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.. . . The evidence in favour of the existence of an elastic medium pervading the nervous matter and capable of being influenced bysimple pressure is all-convincing. . . . In nervous structure there is, unquestionably, a true nervous fluid, as our predecessors taught*The precise chemical (?)** composition of this fluid is not yet well known; the physical characters of it have been little studied.Whether it moves in currents, we do not know; whether it circulates, we do not know; whether it is formed in the centres and passesfrom them to the nerves, or whether it is formed everywhere where blood enters nerve, we do not know. The exact uses of the fluid wedo not consequently know. It occurs to my mind, however, that the veritable fluid of nervous matter is not of itself sufficient to act asthe subtle medium that connects the outer with the inner universe of man and animal. I think -- and this is the modification I suggestto the older theory -- there must be another form of matter present during life; a matter which exists in the condition of vapour or gas,which pervades the whole nervous organism, surrounds as an enveloping atmosphere*** each molecule of nervous structure, and isthe medium of all motion, communicated to and from the nervous centres. . . . When it is once fairly presented to the mind thatduring life there is in the animal body a finely diffused form of matter, a vapour filling every part -- and even stored in some parts; amatter constantly renewed by the vital chemistry; a matter as easily disposed of as the breath, after it has served its purpose -- a newflood of light breaks on the Intelligence .\" . . . .A new flood of light is certainly thrown on the wisdom of ancient and mediaeval Occultism and its votaries. For Paracelsus wrote thesame thing more than three hundred years ago, namely, in the sixteenth century, as follows:--\"The whole of the Microcosm is potentially contained in the Liquor Vitae, a nerve fluid . . . in which is contained the nature, quality,character, and essence of beings.\" . . . (De Generatione Hominis). . . . \"The Archaeus or Liquor Vitae is an essence that is equallydistributed in all parts of the human body. . . . The Spiritus Vitae takes its origin from the Spiritus Mundi. Being an emanation of thelatter, it contains the elements of all cosmic influences, and is therefore the cause by which the action of the stars (cosmic forces) uponthe invisible body of man (his vital lingasharira) may be explained.\" (De Viribus Membrorum.

It may be said that this universal ether pervades all the organism of the animal body as from without, and as partof every organization. This view would be Pantheism physically discovered if it were true (!!) It fails to be true because it would destroythe individuality of every individual sense. . . . .\"We fail to see it, and we know it is not so. Pantheism may be \"physically rediscovered.\" It was known, seen, and felt by the whole ofantiquity. Pantheism manifests itself in the vast expanse of the starry heavens, in the breathing of the seas and oceans and the quiverof life of the smallest blade of grass. Philosophy rejects one finite and imperfect God in the universe, as the anthropomorphic deity ofthe monotheist is represented by his followers. It repudiates in its name of Philo-Theo-Sophia the grotesque idea that Infinite,Absolute Deity should, or rather could, have any, whether direct or indirect, relation to finite illusive evolutions of matter, andtherefore cannot imagine a universe outside that Deity, or the latter absent from the smallest speck of animate or inanimatesubstance.* Why either the Ether of Space, or \"nervous Ether\" should \"destroy the individuality of every sense\" seemsincomprehensible for one acquainted with the real nature of that \"nervous ether\" under its Sanskrit, or rather esoteric and Kabalisticname. Dr. Richardson agrees that --\"If we did not individually produce the medium of communication between ourselves and the outer world, if it were produced fromwithout and adapted to one kind of vibration alone, there were fewer senses required than we possess: for, taking two illustrations only-- ether of light is not adapted for sound, and yet we hear as well as see; while air, the medium of motion of sound, is not the mediumof light, and yet we see and hear.\"This is not so. The opinion that \"Pantheism fails to be true because it would destroy the individuality of every individual sense\" showsthat all the conclusions of the learned doctor are based on the modern physical theories, though he would fain reform them. But hewill find it impossible to do this unless he allows the existence of spiritual senses to replace the gradual atrophy of the physical. \"Wesee and hear,\" in accordance (of course in Dr. Richardson's mind) with the explanations of the phenomena of sight and hearing, bythat same materialistic[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This does not mean that every bush, tree or stone is God or a god; but only that every speck of the manifested material of Kosmosbelongs to and is the substance of \"God,\" however low it may have fallen in its cyclic gyration through the Eternities of the everbecoming,; and also that every such speck individually, and Kosmos collectively, is an aspect and a reminder of that universal OneSoul -- which philosophy refuses to call God, thus limiting the eternal and ever-present root and essence.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 534 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.science which postulates that we cannot see and hear otherwise. The Occultists and mystics know better. The Vedic Aryans were asfamiliar with the mysteries of sound and colour as our physiologists are on the physical plane, but they had mastered the secrets ofboth on planes inaccessible to the materialist. They knew of a double set of senses; spiritual and material. In a man who is deprivedof one or more senses, the remaining become the more developed: e.g., the blind man will recover his sight through the senses oftouch, of hearing, etc., and he who is deaf will be able to hear through sight, by seeing audibly the words uttered by the lips andmouth of the speaker. But these are cases that belong to the world of matter still. The spiritual senses, those that act on a higher planeof consciousness are rejected a priori by physiology because the latter is ignorant of the sacred science. It limits the action of ether tovibrations, and, dividing it from air -- though air is simply differentiated and compound ether -- makes it assume functions to fit in withthe special theories of the physiologist. But there is more real science in the teachings of the Upanishads when these are correctlyunderstood, than the Orientalists, who do not understand them at all, are ready to admit. Mental as well as physical correlations of theseven senses (seven on the physical and seven on the mental planes) are clearly explained and defined in the Vedas, and especiallyin the Upanishad called Anugita: \"The indestructible and the destructible, such is the double manifestation of the Self. Of these theindestructible is the existent (the true essence or nature of Self, the underlying principles). The manifestation as an individual (orentity) is called the destructible.\" Thus speaks the ASCETIC in Anugita; and also: \"Every one who is twice-born (initiated) knows suchis the teaching of the ancients. . . . . Space is the first entity. . . . . Now Space (Akasa, or the noumenon of Ether) has one quality . . .and that is sound only . . . and the qualities of sound are Shadga, Rishabha, Gandhara, Madhyama, Panchama, and beyond these"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"five Nishada and Dhaivata\"; (the Hindu gamut).

The qualities of every Element, as of every sense, are septenary, and to judge and dogmatize on them from theirmanifestation (likewise sevenfold in itself) on the material or objective plane above is quite arbitrary. For it is only by the SELFemancipating itself from these (seven) causes of illusion that one acquires the knowledge (secret wisdom) of the qualities of objects ofsense on their dual plane of manifestation -- the visible and the invisible. Thus it is said:--\"State this wonderful mystery . . . . . Hear the assignment of causes exhaustively.

But while adopting the number, no modernphilosopher has asked himself how these senses could exist, i.e., be perceived and used in a self-conscious way, unless there was thesixth sense, mental perception to register and record them; and (this for the Metaphysicians and Occultists) the SEVENTH to preservethe spiritual fruition and remembrance thereof, as in a Book of Life which belongs to Karma. The ancients divided the senses intofive, simply because their teachers (the Initiates) stopped at the hearing, as being that sense which developed in the physical plane(got dwarfed rather, limited to this plane) only at the beginning of the Fifth Race. (The Fourth Race already had begun to lose thespiritual condition, so pre-eminently developed in the Third Race.)** The modern commentators, failing to comprehend the subtle meaning of the ancient Scholiasts, take this sentence, \"causes of theagents,\" to mean \"that the powers of smelling, etc., when attributed to the Self, make him appear as an agent, as an active principle\"(!), which is entirely fanciful. These \"seven\" are understood to be the causes of the Agents, because \"the objects are causes, as theirenjoyment causes an impression.\" It means esoterically that they, these seven senses, are caused by the AGENTS, which are the\"deities,\" for what does, or can, the sentence which follows this one mean? \"Thus,\" it is said, \"these seven (senses) are the causes ofemancipation\" (i.e., when these causes are made ineffectual). \"And among the learned (the wise Initiates) who understand thequalities which are in the position (in the nature, rather) of the deities, each in its place,\" means simply that the \"learned\" understandthe nature of the noumenoi of the various phenomena; and that \"qualities,\" in this instance, mean the qualities of the high planetaryor Elementary gods or Intelligences, which rule the elements and their products, and not at all \"the senses,\" as the moderncommentator thinks.

We are, however, cycling back and cycling forward; i.e., having lost in spirituality that which we acquired in physicaldevelopment until almost the end of the Fourth Race, we (mankind) are as gradually and imperceptibly losing now in the physical allthat we regain once more in the spiritual re-evolution. This process must go on until the period which will bring the Sixth Root-Raceon a parallel line with the spirituality of the Second, long extinct mankind.But this will hardly be understood at present. We must return to Dr. Richardson's hopeful though somewhat incorrect hypothesis about\"nervous ether.\" Under the misleading translation of the word as \"Space\" (Akasa), it has just been shown in the ancient Hindu systemas the \"first born\" of the One, having but one quality, SOUND (which is septenary). In esoteric language this \"One\" is the \"Father\"Deity, and \"Sound\" is synonymous with Logos (Verbum, or the Son). Whether consciously or otherwise, it must be the latter; and Dr.Richardson, while preaching an Occult doctrine -- chooses the lowest form of the septenary nature of that \"SOUND\" and speculatesupon it, adding:--\"The theory, I offer, is that the nervous Ether is an animal product. In different classes of animals it may differ in physical quality so asto be adapted to the special wants of the animal, but essentially it plays one part in all animals, and is produced, in all, in the sameway. . . .\"Herein lies the nucleus of error leading to all the resultant mistaken views. This \"Nervous Ether\" is the lowest principle of thePrimordial Essence which is Life. It is animal vitality diffused in all nature and acting according to the conditions it finds for its activity.It is not an \"animal product,\" but the living animal, the living flower or plant are its products. The animal tissues only absorb itaccording to their more or less morbid or healthy state -- as do physical materials and structures (in their primogenial State -- notabene) -- and henceforward, from the moment of the birth of the Entity, are regulated, strengthened, and fed by it. It descends in alarger supply to vegetation in the Sushumna sun-ray which lights and feeds the moon, and it is through her beams that it pours itslight upon, and penetrates man and animal, more during their sleep and rest, than when they are in full activity. Therefore Dr.Richardson errs again in stating that:--\"The nervous ether is not, according to my idea of it, in itself active, nor an excitant of animal motion in the sense of a force; but it isessential as supplying the conditions by which the motion is rendered possible.\" (It is just the reverse.) . . . . \"It is the conductor of allvibrations of heat, of light, of sound, of electrical action, of mechanical------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 538 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.friction.* It holds the nervous system throughout in perfect tension, during states of life (true).

Therefore, \"The body fully renewed by it, presents capacity for motion, fulness ofform, life. The body bereft of it presents inertia, the configuration of shrunken death, the evidence of having lost something physicalthat was in it when it lived.\"Modern Science denies the existence of a \"vital principle.\" This extract is a clear proof of its grand mistake. But this \"physicalsomething,\" that we call life-fluid -- the Liquor Vitae of Paracelsus -- has not deserted the body, as Dr. Richardson thinks. It has onlychanged its state from activity to passivity, and become latent owing to the too morbid state of the tissues, on which it has no morehold. Once the rigor mortis absolute, the \"Liquor Vitae\" will re-awaken into action, and begin its work on the atoms chemically.Brahma-Vishnu -- the creator and the Preserver of Life -- will have transformed himself into Siva the Destroyer.Lastly he writes on p. 387:--"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"\"The nervous Ether may be poisoned; it may, I mean, have diffused through it, by simple gaseous diffusion, other gases or vapoursderived from without; it may derive from within products of substances swallowed and ingested, or gases of decomposition producedduring disease in the body itself.\"And the learned gentleman might have added on the same Occult principle: \"That the 'nervous Ether' of one person can be poisonedby the 'nervous Ether' of another person or his auric emanations. But see what Paracelsus said of 'Nervous Ether'\":--\"The Archaeus is of a magnetic nature, and attracts or repels other sympathetic or antipathetic forces belonging to the same plane.The less power of resistance for astral influences a person possesses, the more will he be subject to such influences.

The \"principle of Life\" may kill when too exuberant, as also when there is too little of it. But this principle on themanifested (or our) plane is but the effect and the result of the intelligent action of the \"Host\" -- collectively, Principle -- themanifesting LIFE and LIGHT. It is itself subordinate to, and emanates from the ever-invisible, eternal and Absolute ONE LIFE in adescending and a re-ascending scale of hierarchic degrees -- a true septenary ladder, with SOUND (or the Logos) at the upper endand the Vidyadharas* (the inferior Pitris) at the lower.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In a recent work on the Symbolism in Buddhism and Christianity (in Buddhism and Roman Catholicism, rather, many later ritualsand dogmas in Northern Buddhism in its popular exoteric form, being identical with those of the Latin Church) some curious facts areto be found. The author of this volume, with more pretensions than erudition, has indiscriminately crammed into his work ancient andmodern Buddhist teachings, and sorely confused Lamaism with Buddhism. On page 404 of this volume, called \"Buddhism inChristendom, or Jesus the Essene,\" our pseudo-Orientalist devotes himself to criticizing the \"Seven Principles\" of the EsotericBuddhists, and attempts to ridicule them. On page 405, the closing page, he speaks enthusiastically of the Vidyadharas, \"the sevengreat legions of dead men made wise.\" Now, these \"Vidyadharas,\" whom some Orientalists call \"demi-gods,\" are in fact, exoterically,a kind of Siddhas, \"affluent in devotion,\" and, esoterically, they are identical with the seven classes of Pitris, one class of which endowman in the Third Race with Self-Consciousness by incarnating in the human shells. The \"Hymn to the Sun,\" at the end of his queervolume of mosaic, which endows Buddhism with a personal god (!!), is an unfortunate thrust at the very proofs so elaborately collectedby the unlucky author.Theosophists are fully aware that Mr. Rhys Davids has expressed his opinion on their beliefs likewise. He said that the theoriespropounded by the author of Esoteric Buddhism \"were not Buddhism, and were not Esoteric.\" The remark is the result of (a) theunfortunate mistake of writing \"Buddhism\" instead of \"Budhaism,\" or Budhism, i.e., of connecting the system with Gautama's religioninstead of with the Secret Wisdom taught by Krishna, Sankaracharya, and by many others, as much as by Buddha; and (b) of theimpossibility of Mr. Rhys Davids knowing anything of true esoteric teachings. But he is, at all events, the greatest Pali and Buddhistscholar of the day, and whatever he may say is entitled to respectful hearing. But when one who knows no more of exoteric Buddhismon scientific and materialistic lines, than he knows of esoteric philosophy, defames those whom he honours with his spite, andassumes with the Theosophists the airs of a profound scholar, one can only smile and -- heartily laugh at him.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 540 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Of course, the Occultists are fully aware of the fact that the Vitalist \"fallacy,\" so derided by Vogt and Huxley, is, nevertheless, stillcountenanced in very high scientific quarters, and, therefore, they are happy to feel that they do not stand alone.

Life is not antagonistic to the inanimate forces, but itgoverns and rules their action by its laws.\"*--------------IX.THE SOLAR THEORY.A SHORT ANALYSIS OF THE COMPOUND AND SINGLE ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE AS AGAINST THE OCCULT TEACHINGS. HOWFAR SCIENTIFIC IS THIS THEORY, AS GENERALLY ACCEPTED.IN his reply to Dr. Gull's attack on the theory of vitality (connected inseparably with the Elements of the ancients in the Occultphilosophy), Professor Beale, the great physiologist, has a few words as suggestive as they are beautiful:--\"There is a mystery in life -- a mystery which has never been fathomed, and which appears greater, the more deeply the phenomenaof life are studied and contemplated. In living centres -- far more central than the centres seen by the highest magnifying powers, incentres of living matter, where the eye cannot penetrate, but towards which the understanding may tend -- proceed changes of thenature of which the most advanced physicists and chemists fail to afford us the conception: nor is there the slightest reason to thinkthat the nature of these changes will ever be ascertained by physical investigation, inasmuch as they are certainly of an order ornature totally distinct from that to which any other phenomenon known to us can be relegated.\"This \"mystery,\" or the origin of the LIFE ESSENCE, Occultism locates in the same centre as the nucleus of prima materia (for they areone) of our Solar system.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The Human Species,\" p. 11.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 541 THE HEART OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.\"The Sun is the heart of the Solar World (System) and its brain is hidden behind the (visible) Sun. From thence, sensation is radiatedinto every nerve-centre of the great body, and the waves of the life-essence flow into each artery and vein. . . . The planets are itslimbs and pulses. . . .\" (Commentary.)It was stated elsewhere (in the Theosophist) that Occult philosophy denies that the Sun is a globe in combustion, but defines it simplyas a world, a glowing sphere, the real Sun being hidden behind, and the visible being only its reflection, its shell. The Nasmythwillow leaves, mistaken by Sir J. Herschell for \"Solar inhabitants,\" are the reservoirs of solar vital energy, \"the vital electricity that feedsthe whole system. . . . . The Sun in abscondito being thus the storehouse of our little Kosmos, self-generating its vital fluid, and everreceiving as much as it gives out,\" and the visible Sun only a window cut into the real Solar palace and presence, which reflects,however, faithfully the interior work.Thus, there is a regular circulation of the vital fluid throughout our system, of which the Sun is the heart -- the same as the circulationof the blood in the human body -- during the manvantaric solar period, or life; the Sun contracting as rhythmically at every return of it,as the human heart does. Only, instead of performing the round in a second or so, it takes the solar blood ten of its years, and a wholeyear to pass through its auricles and ventricles before it washes the lungs and passes thence to the great veins and arteries of thesystem.This, Science will not deny, since Astronomy knows of the fixed cycle of eleven years when the number of solar spots increases,* whichis due to the contraction of the Solar HEART. The universe (our world in this case) breathes, just as man and every living creature,plant, and even mineral does upon the earth; and as our globe itself breathes every twenty-four hours. The dark region is not due \"tothe absorption exerted by the vapours issuing from the bosom of the sun and interposed between the observer and the photosphere,\"as Father Secchi would have it (\"Le Soleil\" II., 184), nor are the spots formed \"by the matter (heated gaseous matter) which theirruption projects upon the solar disc\" (ibid). It is similar to the regular and healthy pulsation of the heart, as the life fluid passesthrough its hollow muscles. Could the human heart be made luminous, and the living and throbbing organ be made visible, so as tohave it reflected upon a screen, such as[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Not only does it not deny the occurrence, though attributing it to a wrong cause, as always, each theory contradicting every other,(see the theories of Secchi, of Faye, and of Young), the spots depending on the superficial accumulation of vapours cooler than thephotosphere (?), etc., etc., but we have men of science who astrologize upon the spots. Professor Jevons attributes all the greatperiodical commercial crises to the influence of the Sun spots every eleventh cyclic year.

The homogeneous primordial Element is simple and single only on theterrestrial plane of consciousness and sensation, since matter, after all, is nothing else than the sequence of our own states ofconsciousness, and Spirit an idea of psychic intuition. Even on the next higher plane, that single element which is defined on ourearth by current science, as the ultimate undecomposable constituent of some kind of matter, would be pronounced in the world of ahigher spiritual perception as something very complex indeed. Our purest water would be found to yield, instead of its two declaredsimple elements of oxygen and hydrogen, many other constituents, undreamt of by our terrestrial modern chemistry. As in the realm ofmatter, so in the realm of Spirit, the shadow of that which is cognized on the plane of objectivity exists on that of pure subjectivity.The speck of the perfectly homogeneous substance, the sarcode of the Haeckelian monera, is now viewed as the archebiosis ofterrestrial existence (Mr. Huxley's \"protoplasm\")*; and Bathybius Haeckelii has to be traced to its pre-terrestrial archebiosis. This is firstperceived by the astronomers at its third stage of evolution, and in the \"secondary creation,\" so-called. But the students of Esotericphilosophy understand too well the secret meaning of the stanza: \"Brahma has essentially the aspect of prakriti, both evolved andunevolved . . . . Spirit, O twice-born, (Initiate) is the leading aspect of Brahma. The next is a two-fold aspect -- of Prakriti and Purusha,both evolved and unevolved; and time is the last! Anu is one of the names of Brahma (as distinct from Brahma neuter), and it means\"atom\": Aniyamsam aniyasam, \"the most atomic of the atomic,\" the \"immutable and imperishable (achyuta) Purushottama.\"Surely, then, the elements now known to us -- be their number whatever it may -- as they are understood and defined at present, arenot,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Unfortunately, as these pages are being written the \"archebiosis of terrestrial existence\" has turned, under a somewhat stricterchemical analysis, into a simple precipitate of sulphate of lime -- hence from the scientific standpoint not even an organicsubstance!!! Sic transit gloria mundi!------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 543 THE QUINTESSENCE OF KOSMOS.nor can they be, the primordial elements. Those were formed from \"the curds of the cold radiant mother\" and \"the fire-seed of the hotFather\" who \"are one,\" or, to express it in the plainer language of modern science, those elements had their genesis in the depths ofthe primordial fire-mist -- the masses of incandescent vapour of the irresolvable nebulae; for as Professor Newcomb shows (in his\"Popular Astronomy,\" on page 444), resolvable nebulae are not a class of proper nebulae.More than half of those which were at first mistaken for nebulae -- he thinks -- are what he calls \"starry clusters.\" The elements nowknown, have arrived at their state of permanency in this 4th Round and 5th Race. They have a short period of rest before they arepropelled once more on their upward spiritual evolution; when the \"living fire of Orcus\" will dissociate the most irresolvable andscatter them into the primordial ONE -- again.Meanwhile the Occultist goes further, as has been shown in the Commentaries on the Seven Stanzas. Hence he can hardly hope forany help or recognition from science, which will reject both his \"aniyamsam aniyasam\" (the absolutely spiritual atom) and hisManasaputras -- \"mind-born men.\" By resolving the \"single material element\" into one absolute irresolvable element -- Spirit, or\"Root-matter,\" thus placing it at once outside the reach and province of physical philosophy -- he has, of course but little in commonwith the orthodox men of science. He maintains that Spirit and Matter are two FACETS of the unknowable UNITY, their apparentlycontrasted aspects depending, (a) on the various degrees of differentiation of the latter, and (b) on the grades of consciousnessattained by man himself. This is, however, metaphysics, and has little to do with physics -- however great in its own terrestriallimitation that physical philosophy may now be.Nevertheless, once that Science admits, if not the actual existence, at any rate, the possibility of the existence, of a Universe with itsnumberless forms, conditions, and aspects built out of a \"single Substance,\"* it has[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In his \"World-Life\" -- page 48 -- in the appended foot notes, Professor Winchell says:-- \"It is generally admitted that at excessivelyhigh temperatures matter exists in a state of dissociation -- that is, no chemical combination can exist;\" and would appeal, to provethe unity of matter, to the spectrum, which in every case of homogeneity will show a bright line, whereas in the case of severalmolecular arrangements existing -- in the nebulae say, or a star -- \"the spectrum should consist of two or three bright lines!\" This wouldbe no proof either way to the physicist-Occultist, who maintains that beyond a certain limit of visible matter, no spectrum, notelescope and no microscope are of any use. The unity of matter, of that which is real cosmic matter to the Alchemist, or \"Adam's"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Earth\" as the Kabalists call it, can hardly be proved or disproved, by either the French savant Dumas, who suggests \"the compositenature of the \"elements\" on certain relations of atomic weights,\" or even by Mr. Crookes's \"radiant matter,\" though his experimentsmay seem [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 544 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.to go further. Unless it also admits the possibility of One Element, or the ONE LIFE of the Occultists. It will have to hang up that\"single substance,\" especially if limited to only the solar nebulae, like the coffin of Mahomet, in mid air, though minus the attractivemagnet that sustains that coffin. Fortunately for the speculative physicists, if unable to state with any degree of precision what thenebular theory does imply, we have, thanks to Professor Winchell, and several disagreeing astronomers, been able to learn what itdoes not imply.* (Vide Supra.)Unfortunately, this is far from clearing even the most simple of the problems that have vexed, and still do vex, the men of learning intheir research after truth. We have to proceed with our inquiries, starting with the earliest hypotheses of modern science, if we woulddiscover where and why it sins. Perchance it may be found that Stallo is right, after all. That the blunders, contradictions, and fallaciesmade by the most eminent men of learning are simply due to their abnormal attitude. They are, and want to remain materialisticquand meme, and yet \"the general principles of the atomo-mechanical theory -- the basis of modern physics -- are substantiallyidentical with the cardinal doctrines of ontological metaphysics.\" Thus, \"the fundamental errors of ontology become apparent inproportion to the advance of physical Science.\" (Int. p. VI., \"Concepts of Modern Physics.\") Science is honeycombed withmetaphysical conceptions, but the Scientists will not admit the charge and fight desperately to put atomo-mechanical masks on purelyincorporeal and spiritual laws in nature, on our plane -- refusing to admit their substantiality even on other planes, the bare existenceof which they reject a priori.It is easy to show, however, how Scientists, wedded to their materialistic views, have endeavoured, ever since the day of Newton, toput false masks on fact and truth. But their task is becoming with every year more difficult; and with every year also, Chemistry, aboveall the other sciences, approaches nearer and nearer the realm of the Occult in nature. It is assimilating the very truths taught by theOccult Sciences[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] \"to be best understood on the hypothesis of the homogeneity of the elements of matter,and the continuity of the states of matter.\" For all this does not go beyond MATERIAL matter, so to say, even in what is shown by thespectrum, that modern \"eye of Siva\" of physical experiments. It is of this matter only, that H. St. Claire Deville could say that \"whenbodies, deemed to be simple, combine with one another, they vanish, they are individually annihilated\"; simply because he couldnot follow those bodies in their further transformation in the world of spiritual cosmic matter. Verily modern science will never be ableto dig deep enough into the cosmological formations to find the roots of the world-stuff or matter, unless she works on the same linesof thought as the medieval alchemist did.* \"World-Life,\" Ibid.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 545 THE ORIGINAL BASE.for ages, but hitherto bitterly derided. \"Matter is eternal,\" says the Esoteric Doctrine. But the matter the Occultists conceive of in itslaya, or zero state, is not the matter of modern science; not even in its most rarefied gaseous state. Mr. Crookes' \"radiant matter\" wouldappear matter of the grossest kind in the realm of the beginnings, as it becomes pure spirit before it has returned back even to its firstpoint of differentiation. Therefore, when the adept or alchemist adds that, though matter is eternal, for it is PRADHANA, yet atoms areborn at every new manvantara, or reconstruction of the universe, it is no such contradiction as a materialist, who believes in nothingbeyond the atom, might think. There is a difference between manifested and unmanifested matter, between pradhana, thebeginningless and endless cause, and prakriti, or the manifested effect. Says the sloka; --\"That which is the unevolved cause is emphatically called by the most eminent sages, pradhana, original base, which is subtileprakriti, viz., that which is eternal, and which at once is, and is not, a mere process.\"*That which in modern phraseology is respectively referred to as Spirit and Matter, is ONE in eternity as the perpetual cause, and it isneither Spirit nor matter, but IT -- rendered in Sanskrit TAD (\"that\"), -- all that is, was, or will be, all that the imagination of man iscapable of conceiving. Even the exoteric Pantheism of Hinduism renders it as no monotheistic philosophy ever did, for in superbphraseology its cosmogony begins with the well-known words:--\"There was neither day nor night, neither heaven nor earth, neither darkness nor light. And there was not ought else apprehensible bythe senses or by the mental faculties. There was then one Brahma, essentially prakriti (Nature) and Spirit. For the two aspects ofVishnu which are other than his supreme essential aspect are prakriti and Spirit, and Brahman. When these two other ASPECTS of hisno longer subsist, but are dissolved, then that aspect whence form and the rest, i.e., creation, proceed anew, is denominated time, Otwice-born.\""},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"It is that which is dissolved, or the illusionary dual aspect of That, the essence of which is eternally ONE, that we call eternal matter orSubstance (Vide in Part II., \"Primordial Substance and Divine Thought\"), formless, sexless, inconceivable, even to our sixth sense ormind,** in which, therefore, we refuse to see that which Monotheists call a personal, anthropomorphic God.How are these two propositions -- \"that matter is eternal,\" and \"the atom periodical, and not eternal\" -- viewed by modern exactScience? The materialistic physicist will criticize and laugh them to scorn. The[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Book I. ch. II.

For, hardly has the echo of his lecture on the \"Genesis of the Elements\"died away --the lecture which, delivered by him before the Chemical Section of the British Association, at the last Birminghammeeting, so startled every evolutionist who heard or read it -- than there came another one in March last, 1888. Once more thePresident of the Chemical Society brings before the world of Science and the public the fruits of some new discoveries in the realm ofatoms, and these discoveries justify the occult teachings in every way. They are more startling even than the statements made by himin the first lecture (quoted later) and deserve well the attention of every Occultist, Theosophist, and Metaphysician. This is what hesays in his \"Elements and Meta-Elements,\" thus justifying Stallo's charges and prevision with the fearlessness of a scientific mindwhich loves science for truth's sake, regardless of any consequences to his own glory and reputation. We quote his own words:Permit me, gentlemen, now to draw your attention for a short time to a subject which concerns the fundamental principles ofchemistry, a subject which may lead us to admit the possible existence of bodies which, though neither compounds nor mixtures, arenot elements in the strictest sense of the word -- bodies which I venture to call \"meta-elements.\" To explain my meaning it isnecessary for me to revert to our conception of an element. What is the criterion of an element? Where are we to draw the linebetween distinct existence and identity? No one doubts that oxygen, sodium, chlorine, sulphur are separate elements; and when wecome to such groups as chlorine, bromine, iodine, &c., we still feel no doubt, although were degrees of \"elementicity\" admissible --and to that we may ultimately have to come -- it might be allowed that chlorine approximates much more closely to bromine than tooxygen, sodium, or sulphur. Again, nickel and cobalt are near to each other, very near, though no one questions their claim to rank asdistinct elements. Still I cannot help asking what would have been the prevalent opinion among chemists had the respective solutionsof these bodies and their compounds presented identical colours, instead of colours which, approximately speaking, are mutuallycomplementary. Would their distinct nature have even now been recognised? When we pass further and come to the so-called rareearths the ground is less secure under our feet. Perhaps we may admit scandium, ytterbium, and others of the like sort to elementalrank; but what are we to say in the case of praseo- and neo-dymium, between which there may be said to exist no well-markedchemical difference, their chief claim to separate individuality being slight differences in basicity and crystallizing powers, thoughtheir physical distinctions, as shown by spectrum observations, are very strongly marked? Even here we may imagine the disposition ofthe majority of chemists would incline toward the side of leniency, so that they would admit these two bodies within the charmedcircle. Whether in so doing they would be able to appeal to any broad principle is an open question. If we admit these candidates------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 547 OCCULT CHEMISTRY.how in justice are we to exclude the series of elemental bodies or meta-elements made known to us by Kruss and Nilson? Here thespectral differences are well marked, while my own researches on didymium show also a slight difference in basicity between some atleast of these doubtful bodies. In the same category must be included the numerous separate bodies into which it is probable thatyttrium, erbium, samarium, and other \"elements\" -- commonly so-called -- have been and are being split up. Where then are we todraw the line? The different groupings shade off so imperceptibly the one into the other that it is impossible to erect a definiteboundary between any two adjacent bodies and to say that the body on this side of the line is an element, while the one on the otherside is non-elementary, or merely something which simulates or approximates to an element. Wherever an apparently reasonable linemight be drawn it would no doubt be easy at once to assign most bodies to their proper side, as in all cases of classification the realdifficulty comes in when the border-line is approached. Slight chemical differences, of course, are admitted, and, up to a certainpoint, so are well-marked physical differences. What are we to say, however, when the only chemical difference is an almostimperceptible tendency for the one body -- of a couple or of a group -- to precipitate before the other? Again, there are cases wherethe chemical differences reach the vanishing point, although well-marked physical differences still remain. Here we stumble on a newdifficulty: in such obscurities what is chemical and what is physical? Are we not entitled to call a slight tendency of a nascentamorphous precipitate to fall down in advance of another a \"physical difference?\" And may we not call coloured reactions dependingon the amount of some particular acid present and varying, according to the concentration of the solution and to the solventemployed, \"chemical differences?\" I do not see how we can deny elementary character to a body which differs from another by well-marked colour, or spectrum-reactions, while we accord it to another body whose only claim is a very minute difference in basic powers.Having once opened the door wide enough to admit some spectrum differences, we have to inquire how minute a difference qualifiesthe candidate to pass? I will give instances from my own experience of some of these doubtful candidates."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"And here the great chemist gives several cases of the very extraordinary behaviour of molecules and earths, apparently the same, andwhich yet, when examined very closely, were found to exhibit differences which, however imperceptible, still show that none of themare simple bodies, and that the 60 or 70 elements accepted in chemistry, can no longer cover the ground. Their name, apparently, islegion, but as the so-called \"periodic theory\" stands in the way of an unlimited multiplication of elements, Mr. Crookes is obliged tofind some means of reconciling the new discovery with the old theory. \"That theory,\" he says:--\"Has received such abundant verification that we cannot lightly accept any interpretation of phenomena which fails to be inaccordance with it. But if we suppose the elements reinforced by a vast number of bodies slightly differing from each other in theirproperties, and forming, if I may use the expression,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 548 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.aggregations of nebulae where we formerly saw, or believed we saw, separate stars, the periodic arrangement can no longer bedefinitely grasped. No longer, that is, if we retain our usual conception of an element. Let us, then, modify this conception. For\"element\" read \"elementary group\" -- such elementary groups taking the place of the old elements in the periodic scheme -- and thedifficulty falls away. In defining an element, let us take not an external boundary, but an internal type. Let us say, e.g., the smallestponderable quantity of yttrium is an assemblage of ultimate atoms almost infinitely more like each other than they are to the atoms ofany other approximating element. It does not necessarily follow that the atoms shall all be absolutely alike among themselves. Theatomic weight which we ascribed to yttrium, therefore, merely represents a mean value around which the actual weights of theindividual atoms of the \"element\" range within certain limits. But if my conjecture is tenable, could we separate atom from atom, weshould find them varying within narrow limits on each side of the mean. The very process of fractionation implies the existence ofsuch differences in certain bodies.\"Thus fact and truth have once more forced the hand of \"exact\" Science, and compelled it to enlarge its views and change its termswhich, masking the multitude, reduced them to one body -- like the Septenary Elohim and their hosts transformed by the materialisticreligionists into one Jehovah. Replace the chemical terms \"Molecule,\" \"atom,\" \"particle,\" etc., by the words \"Hosts,\" \"Monads,\"\"Devas,\" etc., and one might think the genesis of gods, the primeval evolution of manvantaric intelligent Forces, was being described.But the learned lecturer adds something still more suggestive to his descriptive remarks; whether consciously or unconsciously, whoknoweth? For he says the following:--\"Until lately such bodies passed muster as elements. They had definite properties, chemical and physical; they had recognised atomicweights. If we take a pure dilute solution of such a body, yttrium for instance, and if we add to it an excess of strong ammonia, weobtain a precipitate which appears perfectly homogeneous. But if instead we add very dilute ammonia in quantity sufficient only toprecipitate one-half of the base present, we obtain no immediate precipitate. If we stir up the whole thoroughly so as to insure auniform mixture of the solution and the ammonia, and set the vessel aside for an hour, carefully excluding dust, we may still find theliquid clear and bright, without any vestige of turbidity. After three or four hours, however, an opalescence will declare itself, and thenext morning a precipitate will have appeared. Now let us ask ourselves, What can be the meaning of this phenomenon? Thequantity of precipitant added was insufficient to throw down more than half the yttria present, therefore a process akin to selection hasbeen going on for several hours. The precipitation has evidently not been effected at random, those molecules of the base beingdecomposed which happened to come in contact with a corresponding molecule of ammonia, for we have taken care that the liquidsshould be uniformly mixed, so that one molecule of the original salt would not be more exposed to decomposition------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 549 MONADS AND ATOMS.than any other. If, further, we consider the time which elapses before the appearance of a precipitate, we cannot avoid coming to theconclusion that the action which has been going on for the first few hours is of a selective character. The problem is not why aprecipitate is produced, but what determines or directs some atoms to fall down and others to remain in solution. Out of the multitudeof atoms present, what power is it that directs each atom to choose the proper path? We may picture to ourselves some directive forcepassing the atoms one by one in review, selecting one for precipitation and another for solution till all have been adjusted.\"The italics in the above passage are ours. Well may a man of science ask himself, \"What power is it that directs each atom,\" and whatis it that its character should be selective? Theists would solve the question by answering \"God\"; and would solve nothingphilosophically. Occultism answers on its own pantheistic grounds, and refers the reader to a subsequent section, \"Gods, Monads, andAtoms.\" The learned lecturer sees in it that which is his chief concern: the finger-posts and the traces of a path which may lead to thediscovery, and the full and complete demonstration of an homogeneous element in nature. He remarks:--\"In order that such a selection can be effected there evidently must be some slight differences between which it is possible to select,and this difference almost certainly must be one of basicity, so slight as to be imperceptible by any test at present known, butsusceptible of being nursed and encouraged to a point when the difference can be appreciated by ordinary tests.\"Occultism, which knows of the existence and presence in Nature of the One eternal element at the first differentiation of which theroots of the tree of life are periodically struck, needs no scientific proofs. It says:-- Ancient Wisdom has solved the problem ages ago.Aye; earnest, as well as mocking reader, Science is slowly but as surely approaching our domains of the Occult. It is forced by its owndiscoveries to adopt nolens volens our phraseology and symbols. Chemical Science is now compelled, by the very force of things, toaccept even our illustration of the evolution of the gods and atoms, so suggestively and undeniably figured in the caduceus ofMercury, the God of Wisdom, and in the allegorical language of the Archaic Sages. Says a commentary in the esoteric doctrine:--"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":". . . . The trunk of the ASVATTHA (the tree of Life and Being, the ROD of the caduceus) grows from and descends at every Beginning(every new manvantara) from the two dark wings of the Swan (HANSA) of Life. The two Serpents, the ever-living and its illusion (Spiritand matter) whose two heads grow from the one head between the wings, descend along the trunk, interlaced in close embrace. Thetwo tails join on earth (the manifested Universe) into one, and this is the great illusion, O Lanoo!\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 550 THE SECRET DOCTRINEEvery one knows what the caduceus is, already modified by the Greeks. The original symbol -- with the triple head of the serpent --became altered into a rod with a knob, and the two lower heads were separated, thus disfiguring somewhat the original meaning. Yetit is as good an illustration as can be for our purpose, this laya rod entwined by two serpents. Verily the wonderful powers of the magiccaduceus were sung by all the ancient poets, with a very good reason for those who understood the secret meaning.[[diagram]]Now what says the learned President of the Chemical Society of Great Britain, in that same lecture, which has any reference to, orbearing upon, our above-mentioned doctrine. Very little; only this -- and nothing more:--\"In the Birmingham address already referred to I asked my audience to picture the action of two forces on the original protyle --- onebeing time, accompanied by a lowering of temperature; the other, swinging to and fro like a mighty pendulum, having periodic cyclesof ebb and swell, rest and activity, being intimately connected with the imponderable matter, essence, or source of energy we callelectricity. Now, a simile like this effects its object if it fixes in the mind the particular fact it is intended to emphasize, but it must notbe expected necessarily to run parallel with all the facts. Besides the lowering of temperature with the periodic ebb and flow ofelectricity, positive or negative, requisite to confer on the newly-born elements their particular atomicity, it is evident that a third factormust be taken into account. Nature does not act on a flat plane; she demands space for her cosmogenic operations, and if weintroduce space as the third factor, all appears clear. Instead of a pendulum, which, though to a certain extent a good illustration, isimpossible as a fact, let us seek some more satisfactory way of representing what I conceive may have taken place. Let us suppose thezigzag diagram not drawn upon a plane, but projected in space of three dimensions. What figure can we best select to meet all theconditions involved? Many of the facts can be well explained by supposing the projection in space of Professor Emerson Reynolds'zigzag curve to be a spiral. This figure is, however, inadmissible, inasmuch as the curve has to pass through a point neutral as toelectricity and chemical energy twice in each cycle. We must, therefore, adopt some other figure. A figure of eight (8), or lemniscate,will foreshorten into a zigzag just as well as a spiral, and it fulfils every condition of the problem.\"A lemniscate for the evolution downward, from Spirit into matter;------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 551 THE CADUCEUS OF LIFE.another form of a spiral, perhaps, in its reinvolutionary path onward, from matter into Spirit, and the necessary gradual and finalreabsorption into the laya state, that which Science calls in her own way \"the point neutral as to electricity\" etc., or the zero point.Such are the Occult facts and statement. They may be left with the greatest security and confidence to Science, to be justified someday. Let us hear some more, however, about this primordial genetic type of the symbolical caduceus.\"Such a figure will result from three very simple simultaneous motions. First, a simple oscillation backwards and forwards (suppose eastand west); secondly, a simple oscillation at right angles to the former (suppose north and south) of half the periodic time -- i.e., twiceas fast; and thirdly, a motion at right angles to these two (suppose downwards), which, in its simplest form, would be with unvaryingvelocity. If we project this figure in space we find on examination that the points of the curves, where chlorine, bromine, and iodineare formed, come close under each other; so also will sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; again, phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony;and in like manner other series of analogous bodies. It may be asked whether this scheme explains how and why the elements appearin this order? Let us imagine a cyclical translation in space, each evolution witnessing the genesis of the group of elements which Ipreviously represented as produced during one complete vibration of the pendulum. Let us suppose that one cycle has thus beencompleted, the centre of the unknown creative force in its mighty journey through space having scattered along its track the primitiveatoms -- the seeds, if I may use the expression -- which presently are to coalesce and develop into the groupings now known aslithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, andchlorine. What is most probably the form of track now pursued? Were it strictly confined to the same plane of temperature and time,the next elementary groupings to appear would again have been those of lithium, and the original cycle would have been eternallyrepeated, producing again and again the same 14 elements. The conditions, however, are not quite the same. Space and electricityare as at first, but temperature has altered, and thus, instead of the atoms of lithium being supplemented with atoms in all respectsanalogous with themselves, the atomic groupings which come into being when the second cycle commences form, not lithium, but itslineal descendant, potassium. Suppose, therefore, the vis generatrix travelling to and fro in cycles along a lemniscate path, as abovesuggested, while simultaneously temperature is declining and time is flowing on -- variations which I have endeavoured to representby the downward sink -- each coil of the lemniscate track crosses the same vertical line at lower and lower points. Projected in space,the curve shows a central line neutral as far as electricity is concerned, and neutral in chemical properties -- positive electricity on thenorth, negative on the south. Dominant atomicities are governed by the distance east and west from the neutral centre line,monatomic elements being one remove from it, diatomic two removes, and so on. In every successive coil the same law holds good.\"And, as if to prove the postulate of Occult Science and Hindu philos-"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 552 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.ophy, that, at the hour of the Pralaya, the two aspects of the unknowable deity, \"the Swan in darkness\" -- Prakriti and Purusha, natureor matter in all its forms and Spirit -- \"no longer subsist but are (absolutely) dissolved,\" we learn the conclusive scientific opinion of thegreat English chemist, who caps his proofs by saying:-- \"We have now traced the formation of the chemical elements from knots andvoids in a primitive, formless fluid. We have shown the possibility, nay, the probability that the atoms are not eternal in existence, butshare with all other created beings the attributes of decay and death.\"Occultism says amen to this, as the Scientific \"possibility\" and \"probability\" are for it facts demonstrated beyond the necessity offurther proof or any extraneous physical evidence. Nevertheless, it repeats with as much assurance as ever: \"MATTER IS ETERNAL,becoming atomic (its aspect) only periodically.\" This is as sure as that the other proposition, which is almost unanimously accepted byastronomers and physicists -- namely, that the wear and tear of the body of the Universe is steadily going on, and that it will finallylead to the extinction of the Solar fires and the destruction of the Universe -- is quite erroneous on the lines traced by Men of Science.There will be, as there ever were in time and eternity, periodical dissolutions of the manifested Universe, but (a) a partial pralaya afterevery \"Day of Brahma;\" and (b) an Universal pralaya -- the MAHA-PRALAYA -- only after the lapse of every Brahma's age. But thescientific causes for such dissolution, as brought forward by exact Science, have nothing to do with the true causes. However that maybe, Occultism is once more justified by Science, for Mr. Crookes said:--\"We have shown, from arguments drawn from the chemical laboratory, that in matter which has responded to every test of an element,there are minute shades of difference which may admit of selection. We have seen that the time-honoured distinction betweenelements and compounds no longer keeps pace with the developments of chemical science, but must be modified to include a vastarray of intermediate bodies -- \"meta-elements.\" We have shown how the objections of Clerk-Maxwell, weighty as they are, may bemet; and finally, we have adduced reasons for believing that primitive matter was formed by the act of a generative force, throwing offat intervals of time atoms endowed with varying quantities of primitive forms of energy. If we may hazard any conjectures as to thesource of energy embodied in a chemical atom, we may, I think, premise that the heat radiations propagated outwards through theether from the ponderable matter of the universe, by some process of nature not yet known to us, are transformed at the confines ofthe universe into the primary -- the essential -- motions of chemical atoms, which, the instant they are formed, gravitate inwards, andthus restore to the universe the energy which otherwise would be lost to it through radiant heat. If this conjecture be well founded, SirWilliam Thomson's startling prediction of the final decrepitude of the universe through the dissipation of its energy falls to the ground.In this------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 553 TRUE SIGNS OF THE TIMES.fashion, gentlemen, it seems to me that the question of the elements may be provisionally treated. Our slender knowledge of thesefirst mysteries is extending steadily, surely, though slowly.\"By a strong and curious coincidence even our \"septenary\" doctrine seems to force the hand of Science. If we understand rightly,Chemistry speaks of fourteen groupings of primitive atoms -- lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sodium,magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur and chlorine; and Mr. Crookes, speaking of the \"dominant atomicities,\"enumerates seven groups of these, for he says:--\"As the mighty focus of creative energy goes round, we see it in successive cycles sowing in one tract of space seeds of lithium,potassium, rubidium, and caesium; in another tract, chlorine, bromine, and iodine; in a third, sodium, copper, silver, and gold; in afourth, sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; in a fifth, beryllium, calcium, strontium, and barium; in a sixth, magnesium, zinc, cadmium,and mercury; in a seventh, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth\" -- which makes seven groupings on the one hand. And aftershowing \"in other tracts the other elements -- namely, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium; silicon, germanium, and tin; carbon,titanium, and zirconium.\"He adds: \"While a natural position near the neutral axis is found for the three groups of elements relegated by Professor Mendeleeff toa sort of Hospital for Incurables -- his eighth family.\" It might be interesting to compare these \"seven of the eighth family of'incurables'\" with the allegories concerning the seven primitive sons of \"Mother, Infinite Space,\" or Aditi, and the eighth son rejectedby her. Many a strange coincidence may thus be found between \"those intermediate links . . . named 'meta-elements or elementoidsand those whom occult science names their noumenoi,' the intelligent minds and rulers of those groupings of Monads and Atoms. Butthis would lead us too far. Let us be content with finding the confession of the fact that \"this deviation from absolute homogeneityshould mark the constitution of these molecules or aggregations of matter which we designate elements and will perhaps be clearer ifwe return in imagination to the earliest dawn of our material universe, and, face to face with the Great Secret, try to consider theprocesses of elemental evolution.\" Thus finally Science, in the person of its highest representatives, in order to make itself clearer tothe profane, adopts the phraseology of such old adepts as Roger Bacon, and returns to the \"protyle.\" All this is hopeful and suggestiveof the \"signs of the times.\"Indeed these \"signs\" are many and multiply daily; but none are more important than those just quoted. For now the chasm betweenthe occult \"superstitious and unscientific\" teachings and \"exact\" science is completely bridged, and one, at least, of the few eminentchemists of the day is in the realm of the infinite possibilities of occultism. Every new------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 1, Page]] 554 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.step he will take will bring him nearer and nearer to that mysterious centre, from which radiate the innumerable paths that lead downSpirit into matter, and which transform the gods and the living monads into man and sentient nature.But we have something more to say on this subject in the following section.-------X.THE COMING FORCE.ITS POSSIBILITIES AND IMPOSSIBILITIES.Shall we say that Force is \"moving matter,\" or \"matter in motion,\" and a manifestation of energy; or that matter and force are thephenomenal differentiated aspects of the one primary, undifferentiated Cosmic Substance?This query is made with regard to that Stanza which treats of FOHAT and his \"Seven brothers or Sons,\" in other words, of the causeand the effects of Cosmic Electricity, the latter called, in Occult parlance, the seven primary forces of Electricity, whose purelyphenomenal, and hence grossest effects are alone cognizable by physicists on the cosmic and especially on the terrestrial plane.These include, among other things, Sound, Light, Colour, etc., etc. Now what does physical Science tell us of these \"Forces\"?SOUND, it says, is a sensation produced by the impact of atmospheric molecules on the tympanum, which, by setting up delicatetremors in the auditory apparatus, thus communicate themselves to the brain. LIGHT is the sensation caused by the impact ofinconceivably minute vibrations of ether on the retina of the eye.So, too, we say. But this is simply the effect produced in our atmosphere and its immediate surroundings, all, in fact, which falls withinthe range of our terrestrial consciousness. Jupiter Pluvius sent his symbol in drops of rain, of water composed, as is believed, of two\"elements,\" which chemistry dissociates and recombines. The compound molecules are in its power, but their atoms still elude itsgrasp. Occultism sees in all these Forces and manifestations a ladder, the lower rungs of which belong to exoteric physics, and thehigher are traced to a living, intelligent, invisible Power, which is, as a rule, the unconcerned, and exceptionally, the conscious causeof the sense-born phenomenon designated as this or another natural law.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 555 DIVINE, INFERNAL, OR TERRESTRIAL FORCE?We say and maintain that SOUND, for one thing, is a tremendous Occult power; that it is a stupendous force, of which the electricitygenerated by a million of Niagaras could never counteract the smallest potentiality when directed with occult knowledge. Sound maybe produced of such a nature that the pyramid of Cheops would be raised in the air, or that a dying man, nay, one at his last breath,would be revived and filled with new energy and vigour.For Sound generates, or rather attracts together, the elements that produce an ozone, the fabrication of which is beyond chemistry,but within the limits of Alchemy. It may even resurrect a man or an animal whose astral \"vital body\" has not been irreparablyseparated from the physical body by the severance of the magnetic or odic chord. As one saved thrice from death by that power, thewriter ought to be credited with knowing personally something about it.And if all this appears too unscientific to be even noticed, let Science explain to what mechanical and physical laws known to it, isdue the recently produced phenomena of the so-called \"Keely motor?\" What is it that acts as the formidable generator of invisible buttremendous force, of that power which is not only capable of driving an engine of 25 horse-power, but has even been employed to liftthe machinery bodily? Yet this is done simply by drawing a fiddle-bow across a tuning fork, as has been repeatedly proven. For theetheric Force, discovered by the well-known (in America and now in Europe) John Worrell Keely, of Philadelphia, is no hallucination.Notwithstanding his failure to utilize it, a failure prognosticated and maintained by some Occultists from the first, the phenomenaexhibited by the discoverer during the last few years have been wonderful, almost miraculous, not in the sense of the supernatural*but of the superhuman. Had Keely been permitted to succeed, he might have reduced a whole army to atoms in the space of a fewseconds as easily as he reduced a dead ox to the same condition.The reader is now asked to give a serious attention to that newly-discovered potency which the discoverer has named \"Inter-EthericForce and Forces.\"In the humble opinion of the Occultists, as of his immediate friends,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The word \"supernatural\" implies above or outside of nature. Nature and Space are one. Now Space for the metaphysician existsoutside of any act of sensation, and is a purely subjective representation; materialism, which would connect it forcibly with one or theother datum of sensation, notwithstanding. For our senses, it is fairly subjective when independent of anything within it. How then canany phenomenon, or anything else, step outside of or be performed beyond that which has no limits? But when spacial extensionbecomes simply conceptual, and is thought of in an idea connected with certain actions, as by the materialists and the physicists, then"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"again they have hardly a right to define and claim that which can or cannot be produced by Forces generated within even limitedspaces, as they have not even an approximate idea of what those forces are.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 556 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Mr. Keely, of Philadelphia, was, and still is, at the threshold of some of the greatest secrets of the Universe; of that chiefly on which isbuilt the whole mystery of physical Forces, and the esoteric significance of the \"Mundane Egg\" symbolism. Occult philosophy, viewingthe manifested and the unmanifested Kosmos as a UNITY, symbolizes the ideal conception of the former by that \"Golden Egg\" withtwo poles in it. It is the positive pole that acts in the manifested world of matter, while the negative is lost in the unknowableabsoluteness of SAT -- \"Be-ness.\"* Whether this agrees with the philosophy of Mr. Keely, we cannot tell, nor does it really muchmatter. Nevertheless, his ideas about the ethero-material construction of the Universe look strangely like our own, being in this respectnearly identical. This is what we find him saying in an able pamphlet compiled by Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, an American lady ofwealth and position, whose incessant efforts in the pursuit of truth can never be too highly appreciated:-- \"Mr. Keely, in explanation ofthe working of his engine, says: 'In the conception of any machine heretofore constructed, the medium for inducing a neutral centrehas never been found. If it had, the difficulties of perpetual-motion seekers would have ended, and this problem would have becomean established and operating fact. It would only require an introductory impulse of a few pounds, on such a device, to cause it to runfor centuries. In the conception of my vibratory engine, I did not seek to attain perpetual motion; but a circuit is formed that actuallyhas a neutral centre, which is in a condition to be vivified by my vibratory ether, and, while under operation by said substance, isreally a machine that is virtually independent of the mass (or globe),** and it is the wonderful velocity of the vibratory circuit whichmakes it so. Still, with all its perfection, it requires to be fed with the vibratory ether to make it an independent motor . . . .\"\"All structures require a foundation in strength according to the weight of the mass they have to carry, but the foundations of theuniverse rest on a vacuous point far more minute than a molecule; in fact, to express this truth properly, on an inter-etheric point,which requires an infinite mind to understand it. To look down into the depths of an etheric centre is precisely the same as it would beto search into the broad space of heaven's ether to find the end, with this difference: that one is the positive field, while the other isthe negative field . . . .\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is not correct, when speaking of idealism, to show it based upon \"the old ontological assumptions that things or entities existindependently of each other, and otherwise than as terms of relations\" (Stallo). At any rate, it is incorrect to say so of idealism inEastern philosophy and its cognition, for it is just the reverse.** Independent, in a certain sense, but not disconnected with it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 557 AN UNCONSCIOUS OCCULTIST.This, as easily seen, is precisely the Eastern doctrine. His inter-etheric point is the laya-point of the Occultists, which, however, doesnot require \"an infinite mind to understand it,\" but only a specific intuition and ability to trace its hiding-place in this world of matter.Of course, the laya centre cannot be produced, but an inter-etheric vacuum can -- as proved in the production of bell-sounds in space.Mr. Keely speaks as an unconscious Occultist, nevertheless, when he remarks in his theory of planetary suspension:--\"As regards planetary volume, we would ask in a scientific point of view, How can the immense difference of volume in the planetsexist without disorganising the harmonious action that has always characterised them? I can only answer this question properly byentering into a progressive analysis, starting on the rotating etheric centres that were fixed by the Creator* with their attractive oraccumulative power. If you ask what power it is that gives to each etheric atom its inconceivable velocity of rotation (or introductoryimpulse), I must answer that no finite mind will ever be able to conceive what it is. The philosophy of accumulation is the only proofthat such a power has been given. The area, if we can so speak, of such an atom, presents to the attractive or magnetic, the electiveor propulsive, all the receptive force and all the antagonistic force that characterises a planet of the largest magnitude; consequently,as the accumulation goes on, the perfect equation remains the same. When this minute centre has once been fixed, the power torend it from its position would necessarily have to be so great as to displace the most immense planet that exists. When this atomicneutral centre is displaced, the planet must go with it. The neutral centre carries the full load of any accumulation from the start, andremains the same, for ever balanced in the eternal space.\"Mr. Keely illustrates his idea of \"a neutral centre\" in this way:--\"We will imagine that, after an accumulation of a planet of any diameter, say, 20,000 miles, more or less, for the size has nothing todo with the problem; there should be a displacement of all the material, with the exception of a crust 5,000 miles thick, leaving anintervening void between this crust and a centre of the size of an ordinary billiard ball, it would then require a force as great to movethis small central mass as it would to move the shell of 5,000 miles thickness. Moreover, this small central mass would carry the load ofthis crust for ever, keeping it equidistant; and there could be no opposing power, however great, that could bring them together. Theimagination staggers in contemplating the immense load which bears upon this point of centre, where weight ceases. . . . This is whatwe understand by a neutral centre.\"And what Occultists understand by a \"laya centre.\""},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The above is pronounced \"unscientific\" by many. But so is everything that is not sanctioned and kept on strictly orthodox lines byphysical science. Unless the explanation given by the inventor himself is accepted -- and his explanations, being, as observed, quiteorthodox from[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"By Fohat, more likely,\" would be an Occultist's reply.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 558 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the spiritual and the Occult stand-points, if not from that of materialistic speculative (called exact) Science, are therefore ours in thisparticular -- what can science answer to facts already seen which it is no longer possible for anyone to deny? Occult philosophydivulges few of its most important vital mysteries. It drops them like precious pearls, one by one, far and wide apart, and only whenforced to do so by the evolutionary tidal wave that carries on humanity slowly, silently, but steadily toward the dawn of the Sixth-Racemankind. For once out of the safe custody of their legitimate heirs and keepers, those mysteries cease to be occult: they fall into thepublic domain and have to run the risk of becoming in the hands of the selfish -- of the Cains of the human race -- curses more oftenthan blessings. Nevertheless, whenever such individuals as the discoverer of Etheric Force -- John Worrell Keely -- men with peculiarpsychic and mental capacities* are born, they are generally and more frequently helped than allowed to go unassisted; groping ontheir way, though, if left to their own resources, falling very soon victims to martyrdom and unscrupulous speculators. Only they arehelped on the condition that they should not become, whether consciously or unconsciously, an additional peril to their age: a dangerto the poor, now offered in daily holocaust by the less wealthy to the very wealthy.** This necessitates a short digression and anexplanation.Some twelve years back, during the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, the writer, in answering the earnest queries of a theosophist,one of the earliest admirers of Mr. Keely, repeated to him what she had heard in quarters, information from which she could neverdoubt.It had been stated that the inventor of the \"Self-Motor\" was what is called, in the jargon of the Kabalists, a \"natural-born magician.\"That he was and would remain unconscious of the full range of his powers, and would work out merely those which he had found outand ascertained in his own nature -- firstly, because, attributing them to a wrong source, he could never give them full sway; and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The reason for such psychic capacities is given farther on.** The above was written two years ago, at a time when hopes of success for the \"Keely Motor\" were at their highest. What was thensaid by the writer proved true, in every word, and now only a few remarks are added to it with regard to the failure of his expectations,so far, which has now been admitted by the discoverer himself. Though, however, the word failure is here used the reader shouldunderstand it in a relative sense, for as Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore explains: \"What Mr. Keely does admit is that, baffled in applyingvibratory force to mechanics, upon his first and second lines of experimental research, he was obliged either to confess a commercialfailure, or to try a third departure from his base or principle; seeking success through another channel.\". . And this \"channel\" is on the physical plane.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 559 THE FIRST-BORN OF ETHER.secondly, because it was beyond his power to pass to others that which was a capacity inherent in his special nature. Hence the wholesecret could not be made over permanently to anyone for practical purposes or use.*Individuals born with such a capacity are not very rare. That they are not heard of more frequently is due to the fact that they live anddie, in almost every case, in utter ignorance of being possessed of abnormal powers at all. Mr. Keely possesses powers which arecalled \"abnormal\" just because they happen in our day to be as little known as blood circulation was before Harvey's time. Bloodexisted, and it behaved as it does at present in the first man born from woman; and so does that principle in man which can controland guide etheric vibratory force. At any rate it exists in all those mortals whose inner selves are primordially connected, by reason oftheir direct descent, with that group of Dhyan-Chohans who are called \"the first-born of Ether.\" Mankind, psychically considered, isdivided into various groups, each of which is connected with one of the Dhyanic groups that first formed psychic man; (see paragraphs1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the Commentary to Stanza VII.) Mr. Keely being greatly favoured in this respect, and moreover, besides his psychictemperament, being intellectually a genius in mechanics, may thus achieve most wonderful results. He has achieved some already --more than any mortal man, not initiated into the final mysteries, has achieved in this age up to the present day. What he has done iscertainly quite sufficient \"to demolish with the hammer of Science the idols of Science\" -- the idols of matter with the feet of clay -- ashis friends justly predict and say of him. Nor would the writer for a moment think of contradicting Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, when in herpaper on \"Psychic Force and Etheric Force,\" she states that Mr. Keely, as a philosopher, \"is great enough in soul, wise enough inmind, and sublime enough in courage to overcome all difficulties, and to stand at last before the world as the greatest discoverer andinventor in the world.\"And again she writes:-- \"Should Keely do no more than lead scientists from the dreary realms where they are groping into the openfield of elemental force, where gravity and cohesion are disturbed in their haunts and diverted to use; where, from unity of origin,"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"emanates infinite energy in diversified forms, he will achieve immortal fame. Should he demonstrate, to the destruction ofmaterialism, that the universe is animated by a mysterious principle to which matter, however perfectly organized, is absolutelysubservient, he will be a greater spiritual benefactor to our race than the modern world has yet found in any man. Should he be ableto substitute, in the treatment of disease,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We learn that these remarks are not applicable to Mr. Keely's latest discovery; time alone can show the exact limit of hisachievements.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 560 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the finer forces of nature for the grossly material agencies which have sent more human beings to their graves than war, pestilenceand famine combined, he will merit and receive the gratitude of mankind. All this and more will he do, if he and those who havewatched his progress, day by day for years, are not too sanguine in their expectations.\"Writing in the T. P. S. (\"Theosophical Publication Society\") series (No. 9), the same lady, in her pamphlet, \"Keely's Secrets,\" bringsforward a passage from an article, written a few years ago by the writer of the present volume, in her journal, the Theosophist, in thesewords:--\"The author of No. 5 of the pamphlets issued by the Theosophical Publication Society, 'What is Matter and What is Force,' saystherein, 'The men of science have just found out \"a fourth state of matter,\" whereas the Occultists have penetrated years ago beyondthe sixth, and therefore do not infer, but know of, the existence of the seventh, the last.' This knowledge comprises one of the secretsof Keely's so-called 'compound secret.' It is already known to many that his secret includes 'the augmentation of energy,' the insulationof the ether, and the adaptation of dynaspheric force to machinery.\"It is just because Keely's discovery would lead to a knowledge of one of the most occult secrets, a secret which can never be allowedto fall into the hands of the masses, that his failure to push his discoveries to their logical end seems certain to Occultists. But of thismore presently. Even in its limitations this discovery may prove of the greatest benefit. For:--\"Step by step, with a patient perseverance which some day the world will honour, this man of genius has made his researches,overcoming the colossal difficulties which again and again raised up in his path what seemed to be (to all but himself)insurmountable barriers to further progress: but never has the world's index finger so pointed to an hour when all is making ready forthe advent of the new form of force that mankind is waiting for. Nature, always reluctant to yield her secrets, is listening to thedemands made upon her by her master, necessity. The coal mines of the world cannot long afford the increasing drain made uponthem. Steam has reached its utmost limits of power, and does not fulfil the requirements of the age. It knows that its days arenumbered. Electricity holds back, with bated breath, dependent upon the approach of her sister colleague. Air ships are riding atanchor, as it were, waiting for the force which is to make aerial navigation something more than a dream. As easily as mencommunicate with their offices from their homes by means of the telephone, so will the inhabitants of separate continents talk acrossthe ocean. Imagination is palsied when seeking to foresee the grand results of this marvellous discovery, when once it is applied to artand mechanics. In taking the throne which it will force steam to abdicate, dynaspheric force will rule the world with a power so mightyin the interests of civilization, that no finite mind can conjecture the results. Laurence Oliphant, in his preface to 'Scientific Religion,'says: 'A new moral future is dawning upon the human race -- one, certainly, of which it stands much in need.' In no way could this------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 561 ETHERIC WAVES.new moral future be so widely, so universally, commenced as by the utilizing of dynaspheric force to beneficial purposes in life. . . . .\"The Occultists are ready to admit all this with the eloquent writer. Molecular vibration is, undeniably, \"Keely's legitimate field ofresearch,\" and the discoveries made by him will prove wonderful -- yet only in his hands and through himself. The world so far will getbut that with which it can be safely entrusted. The truth of this assertion has, perhaps, not yet quite dawned upon the discovererhimself, since he writes that he is absolutely certain that he will accomplish all that he has promised, and will then give it out to theworld; but it must dawn upon him, and at no very far distant date. And what he says in reference to his work is a good proof of it:--\"In considering the operation of my engine, the visitor, in order to have even an approximate conception of its modus operandi, mustdiscard all thought of engines that are operated upon the principle of pressure and exhaustion, by the expansion of steam or otheranalogous gas which impinges upon an abutment, such as the piston of a steam-engine. My engine has neither piston nor eccentrics,nor is there one grain of pressure exerted in the engine, whatever may be the size or capacity of it.\"My system, in every part and detail, both in the developing of my power and in every branch of its utilization, is based and foundedon sympathetic vibration. In no other way would it be possible to awaken or develop my force, and equally impossible would it be tooperate my engine upon any other principle. . . . . . .This, however, is the true system; and henceforth all my operations will beconducted in this manner -- that is to say, my power will be generated, my engines run, my cannon operated, through a wire.\"It has been only after years of incessant labour, and the making of almost innumerable experiments, involving not only theconstruction of a great many most peculiar mechanical structures, and the closest investigation and study of the phenomenal"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"properties of the substance 'ether,' per se, produced, that I have been able to dispense with complicated mechanism, and to obtain,as I claim, mastery over the subtle and strange force with which I am dealing.\"The passages underlined by us, are those which bear directly on the occult side of the application of the vibratory force, or what Mr.Keely calls \"sympathetic vibration.\" The \"wire\" is already a step below, or downward from the pure etheric plane into the terrestrial.The discoverer has produced marvels -- the word \"miracle\" is not too strong -- when acting through the inter-etheric Force alone, thefifth and sixth principles of Akasa. From a \"generator\" six feet long, he has come down to one \"no larger than an old-fashioned silverwatch;\" and this by itself is a miracle of mechanical (but not spiritual) genius. But, as well expressed by his great patroness anddefender, Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, \"the two forms of force which he has been experimenting with, and the phenomena attendingthem, are the very antithesis of each other.\" One was generated and acted upon by and------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 562 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.through himself. No one, who should have repeated the thing done by himself, could have produced the same results. It was \"Keely'sether\" that acted truly, while \"Smith's or Brown's\" ether would have remained for ever barren of results. For Keely's difficulty hashitherto been to produce a machine which would develop and regulate the \"force\" without the intervention of any \"will power\" orpersonal influence, whether conscious or unconscious of the operator. In this he has failed, so far as others were concerned, for no onebut himself could operate on his \"machines.\" Occultly this was a far more advanced achievement than the \"success\" which heanticipates from his \"wire,\" but the results obtained from the fifth and sixth planes of the etheric (or Astral) Force, will never bepermitted to serve for purposes of commerce and traffic. That Keely's organism is directly connected with the production of themarvellous results is proven by the following statement emanating from one who knows the great discoverer intimately.At one time the shareholders of the \"Keely Motor Co.\" put a man in his workshop for the express purpose of discovering his secret.After six months of close watching, he said to J. W. Keely one day: \"I know how it is done, now.\" They had been setting up a machinetogether, and Keely was manipulating the stop-cock which turned the force on and off. \"Try it, then,\" was the answer. The man turnedthe cock, and nothing came. \"Let me see you do it again,\" the man said to Keely. The latter complied, and the machinery operatedat once. Again the other tried, but without success. Then Keely put his hand on his shoulder and told him to try once more. He did so,with the result of an instantaneous production of the current. This fact, if true, settles the question.We are told that Mr. Keely defines electricity \"as a certain form of atomic vibration.\" In this he is quite right; but this is electricity onthe terrestrial plane, and through terrestrial correlations. He estimates --Molecular vibrations at 100,000,000 per second.Inter-molecular vibrations at 300,000,000 per secondAtomic vibrations at 900,000,000 per secondInter-atomic vibrations at 2,700,000,000 per secondAEtheric vibrations at 8,100,000,000 per secondInter-AEtheric vibrations at 24,300,000,000 per secondThis proves our point. There are no vibrations that could be counted or even estimated at an approximate rate beyond \"the realm ofthe fourth son of Fohat,\" using an occult phraseology, or that motion which corresponds to the formation of Mr. Crookes' radiantmatter, or lightly called some years ago the \"fourth state of matter\" -- on this our plane.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 563 A PREMATURE DISCOVERY.If the question is asked why Mr. Keely was not allowed to pass a certain limit, the answer is easy; because that which he hasunconsciously discovered, is the terrible sidereal Force, known to, and named by the Atlanteans MASH-MAK, and by the Aryan Rishisin their Ashtar Vidya by a name that we do not like to give. It is the vril of Bulwer Lytton's \"Coming Race,\" and of the coming races ofour mankind. The name vril may be a fiction; the Force itself is a fact doubted as little in India as the existence itself of their Rishis,since it is mentioned in all the secret works.It is this vibratory Force, which, when aimed at an army from an Agni Rath fixed on a flying vessel, a balloon, according to theinstructions found in Ashtar Vidya, reduced to ashes 100,000 men and elephants, as easily as it would a dead rat. It is allegorised inthe Vishnu Purana, in the Ramayana and other works, in the fable about the sage Kapila whose glance made a mountain of ashes ofKing Sagara's 60,000 sons, and which is explained in the esoteric works, and referred to as the Kapilaksha -- \"Kapila's Eye.\"And is it this Satanic Force that our generations were to be allowed to add to their stock of Anarchist's baby-toys, known as melenite,dynamite clock-works, explosive oranges, \"flower baskets,\" and such other innocent names? Is it this destructive agency, which, once inthe hands of some modern Attila, e.g., a blood-thirsty anarchist, would reduce Europe in a few days to its primitive chaotic state withno man left alive to tell the tale -- is this force to become the common property of all men alike?What Mr. Keely has already done is grand and wonderful in the extreme; there is enough work before him in the demonstration of hisnew system to \"humble the pride of those scientists who are materialistic, by revealing those mysteries which lie behind the world ofmatter,\" without revealing it nolens volens to all. For surely Psychists and Spiritualists -- of whom there are a good number in theEuropean armies -- would be the first to experience personally the fruits of such mysteries revealed. Thousands of them would findthemselves (and perhaps with the populations of whole countries to keep them company) in blue Ether very soon, were such a Force"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"to be even entirely discovered, let alone made publicly known. The discovery in its completeness is by several thousand -- or shall wesay hundred thousand? -- years too premature. It will be at its appointed place and time only when the great roaring flood ofstarvation, misery, and underpaid labour ebbs back again -- as it will when happily at last the just demands of the many are attendedto; when the proletariat exists but in name, and the pitiful cry for bread, that rings throughout the world unheeded, has died away.This may be hastened by the spread of learning,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 564 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and by new openings for work and emigration, with better prospects than exist now, and on some new continent that may appear.Then only will \"Keely's Motor and Force,\" as originally contemplated by himself and friends, be in demand, because it will be moreneeded by the poor than by the wealthy.Meanwhile the force discovered by him will work through wires, and this, if he succeeds, will be quite sufficient in the presentgeneration to make of him the greatest discoverer of this age.What Mr. Keely says of Sound and Colour is also correct from the Occult stand-point. Hear him talk as though he were the nursling ofthe \"Gods-revealers,\" and had gazed all his life into the depths of Father-Mother AEther.In comparing the tenuity of the atmosphere with that of the etheric flows, obtained by him from his invention for breaking up themolecules of air by vibration, Keely says that:--. . . \"It is as platina to hydrogen gas. Molecular separation of air brings us to the first sub-division only; inter-molecular, to the second;atomic, to the third; inter-atomic, to the fourth; etheric, to the fifth; and inter-etheric, to the sixth sub-division, or positive associationwith luminiferous ether.* In my introductory argument I have contended that this is the vibratory envelope of all atoms. In mydefinition of atom I do not confine myself to the sixth sub-division where this luminiferous ether is developed in its crude form as far asmy researches prove.** I think this idea will be pronounced by the physicists of the present day, a wild freak of the imagination.Possibly, in time, a light may fall upon this theory that will bring its simplicity forward for scientific research. At present I can onlycompare it to some planet in a dark space, where the light of the sun of science has not yet reached it. . .\"\"I assume that sound, like odour, is a real substance of unknown and wonderful tenuity, emanating from a body where it has beeninduced by percussion and throwing out absolute corpuscles of matter, inter-atomic particles, with velocity of 1,120 feet per second; invacuo 20,000. The substance which is thus disseminated is a part and parcel of the mass agitated, and, if kept under this agitationcontinuously, would, in the course of a certain cycle of time, become thoroughly absorbed by the atmosphere; or, more truly, wouldpass through the atmosphere to an elevated point of tenuity corresponding to the condition of sub-division that governs its liberationfrom its parent body.\" . . .\"The sounds from vibratory forks, set so as to produce etheric chords, while disseminating their tones (compound), permeate mostthoroughly all substances that come under the range of their atomic bombardment. The clapping of a bell in vacuo liberates theseatoms with the same velocity and volume as one in the open air; and were the agitation of the bell kept up continuously for a fewmillions of centuries it would[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This also is the division, made by the Occultists, under other names.** Quite so, since there is the seventh beyond, which begins the same enumeration, from the first to the last, on another and higherplane.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 565 THE SECRETS OF SOUND AND ODOUR.thoroughly return to its primitive element; and, if the chamber were hermetically sealed, and strong enough, the vacuous volumesurrounding the bell would be brought to a pressure of many thousands of pounds to the square inch, by the tenuous substanceevolved. In my estimation, sound truly defined is the disturbance of atomic equilibrium, rupturing actual atomic corpuscles; and thesubstance thus liberated must certainly be a certain order of etheric flow. Under these conditions, is it unreasonable to suppose that, ifthis flow were kept up, and the body thus robbed of its element, it would in time disappear entirely? All bodies are formed primitivelyfrom this highly tenuous ether, animal, vegetable, and mineral, and they are only returned to their high gaseous condition whenbrought under a state of differential equilibrium.\" . . .\"As regards odour, we can only get some definite idea of its extreme and wondrous tenuity by taking into consideration that a largearea of atmosphere can be impregnated for a long series of years from a single grain of musk; which, if weighed after that longinterval, will be found to be not appreciably diminished. The great paradox attending the flow of odorous particles is that they can beheld under confinement in a glass vessel! Here is a substance of much higher tenuity than the glass that holds it, and yet it cannotescape. It is as a sieve with its meshes large enough to pass marbles, and yet holding fine sand which cannot pass through; in fact, amolecular vessel holding an atomic substance. This is a problem that would confound those who stop to recognize it. But infinitelytenuous as odour is, it holds a very crude relation to the substance of sub-division that governs a magnetic flow (a flow of sympathy, ifyou please to call it so). This sub-division comes next to sound, but is above sound. The action of the flow of a magnet coincides"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"somewhat to the receiving and distributing portion of the human brain, giving off at all times a depreciating ratio of the amountreceived. It is a grand illustration of the control of mind over matter, which gradually depreciates the physical till dissolution takesplace. The magnet on the same ratio gradually loses its power and becomes inert. If the relations that exist between mind and mattercould be equated and so held, we would live on in our physical state eternally, as there would be no physical depreciation. But thisphysical depreciation leads, at its terminus, to the source of a much higher development -- viz., the liberation of the pure ether fromthe crude molecular; which, in my estimation, is to be much desired.\" -- (From Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore's paper, \"The New Philosophy.\")It may be remarked that, save a few small divergencies, no Adept nor Alchemist could have explained the above any better, in thelight of modern Science, however much the latter may protest against the novel views. This is, in all its fundamental principles, if notdetails, Occultism pure and simple, yet withal, modern natural philosophy as well.This \"New Force,\" or whatever Science may call it, the effects of which are undeniable -- admitted by more than one naturalist andphysicist who has visited Mr. Keely's laboratory and witnessed personally its tremendous effects -- what is it? Is it a \"mode of motion,\"also, \"in Vacuo,\" since there is no matter to generate it except Sound -- another \"mode of motion,\" no doubt, a sensation caused like------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 566 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.colour by vibrations? Fully as we believe in these vibrations as the proximate -- the immediate -- cause of such sensations, we asabsolutely reject the one-sided scientific theory that there is no factor to be considered as external to us, other than etheric oratmospheric vibrations.*There is a transcendental set of causes put in motion -- so to speak -- in the occurrence of these phenomena, which, not being inrelation to our narrow range of cognition, can only be traced to their source and their nature, and understood by the Spiritual facultiesof the Adept. They are, as Asclepios puts it to the King, \"incorporeal corporealities\" -- such as \"appear in the mirror,\" and \"abstractforms\" that we see, hear, and smell, in our dreams, and visions. What have the \"modes of motion,\" light, and ether to do with these?Yet we see, hear, and smell, and touch them, ergo they are as much realities to us in our dreams, as any other thing on this plane ofMaya.-------XI.ON THE ELEMENTS AND ATOMS.FROM THE STAND-POINT OF SCIENCE AND THAT OF OCCULTISM.WHEN the Occultist speaks of \"Elements,\" and of human Beings who lived during those geological ages, the duration of which it isfound as impossible to determine, according to the opinion of one of the best[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In this case the American \"Substantialists\" are not wrong (though too anthropomorphic and material in their views to be accepted bythe Occultists) when arguing through Mrs. M. S. Organ, M.D., that \"there must be positive entitative properties in objects which have aconstitutional relation to the nerves of animal sensations, or there can be no perception. No impression of any kind can be made uponbrain, nerve, or mind -- no stimulus to action -- unless there is an actual and direct communication of a substantial force.\"(\"Substantial\" as far as it appears in the usual sense of the word in this universe of illusion and MAYA, of course; not so in reality.)\"That force may be the most refined and sublimated immaterial Entity (?). Yet it must exist; for no sense, element, or faculty of thehuman being can have a perception, or be stimulated into action, without some substantial force coming in contact with it. This is thefundamental law pervading the whole organic and mental world. In the true philosophical sense there is no such thing asindependent action: for every force or substance is correlated to some other force or substance. We can with just as much truth andreason assert that no substance possesses any inherent gustatory property or any olfactory property -- that taste and odour are simplysensations caused by vibrations; and hence mere illusions of animal perceptions. . . .\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 567 METAPHYSICAL CHEMISTRY.English geologists*, as the nature of matter, it is because he knows what he is talking about. When he says \"Man\" and Elements, heneither means \"man\" in his present physiological and anthropological form, nor the elemental atoms, those hypothetical conceptions,the entitative abstractions of matter in its highly attenuated state, as existing at present in scientific minds; nor, again, the compoundElements of antiquity. In Occultism the word Element means \"rudiment\" in every case. When we say \"Elementary Man,\" we meaneither the proemial, incipient sketch of man, in its unfinished and undeveloped condition, hence in that form which now lies latent inphysical man during his life-time, and takes shape only occasionally and under certain conditions; or that form which for a timesurvives the material body, and which is better known as an \"Elementary.\"** With regard to \"Element,\" when the term is usedmetaphysically, it means, in distinction to the mortal, the incipient divine man; and, in its physical usage, inchoate matter in its firstundifferentiated condition, or in the laya state, which is the eternal and the normal condition of substance, differentiating onlyperiodically, and is during that differentiation in an abnormal state -- in other words, a transitory illusion of the senses."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"As to the \"elemental atoms,\" so called, the Occultists refer to them by that name with a meaning analogous to that which is given bythe Hindu to Brahma when he calls him ANU, the \"Atom.\" Every elemental atom, in search of which more than one Chemist hasfollowed the path indicated by the Alchemists, is, in their firm belief (when not knowledge), a SOUL; not necessarily a disembodiedsoul, but a jiva, as the Hindus call it, a centre of POTENTIAL VITALITY, with latent intelligence in it, and, in the case of compoundSouls -- an intelligent active EXISTENCE, from the highest to the lowest order, a form composed of more or less differentiations. Itrequires a metaphysician -- and an Eastern metaphysician -- to understand our meaning. All those atom-Souls are differentiationsfrom the ONE, and in the same relation to it as the divine Soul -- the Buddhi -- to its informing and inseparable Spirit, or Atman.Modern physics, while borrowing from the ancients their atomic theory, forgot one point, the most important of the doctrine; hencethey got only the husks and will never be able to get at the kernel. They left behind, in the adoption of physical atoms, the suggestivefact that[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In answer to a friend, that eminent geologist writes: . . . .\"I can only say, in reply to your letter, that it is at present, and perhapsalways will be, IMPOSSIBLE to reduce, even approximately, geological time into years, or even into millenniums.\" (Signed WilliamPengelly, F.R.S.)** Plato speaking of the irrational, turbulent Elements \"composed of fire, air, water, and earth,\" means Elementary Daemons. (SeeTimaeus.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 568 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.from Anaxagoras down to Epicurus, the Roman Lucretius, and finally even to Galileo, all those Philosophers believed more or less inANIMATED atoms, not in invisible specks of so-called \"brute\" matter. Rotatory motion was generated in their views, by larger (read,more divine and pure) atoms forcing downwards other atoms; the lighter ones being thrust simultaneously upward. The esotericmeaning of this is the ever cyclic curve downward and upward of differentiated elements through intercyclic phases of existence, untileach reaches again its starting point or birthplace. The idea was metaphysical as well as physical; the hidden interpretationembracing \"gods\" or souls, in the shape of atoms, as the causes of all the effects produced on Earth by the secretions from the divinebodies.* No ancient philosopher, not even the Jewish Kabalists, ever dissociated Spirit from matter or vice versa. Everythingoriginated in the ONE, and, proceeding from the one, must finally return to the One. \"Light becomes heat, and consolidates into fieryparticles; which, from being ignited, become cold, hard particles, round and smooth. And this is called Soul, imprisoned in its robe ofmatter;\"** Atoms and Souls having been synonymous in the language of the Initiates. The \"whirling Souls,\" Gilgoolem, a doctrine inwhich so many learned Jews have believed (See Mackenzie's Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia), had no other meaning esoterically. Thelearned Jewish Initiates never meant by the \"Promised land\" Palestine alone, but the same Nirvana as the learned Buddhist andBrahmin do -- the bosom of the ETERNAL ONE, symbolized by that of Abraham, and by Palestine as its substitute on Earth.*** Thepassage of the SOUL-ATOM \"through the Seven Planetary Chambers\" had the same metaphysical and also physical meaning. It hadthe latter when it was said to dissolve into Ether (See Isis Unveiled, Vol. I., p. 297.) Even Epicurus, the model Atheist and materialist,knew and believed so much in the ancient Wisdom, that he taught that the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Plato uses the words \"secretions\" of turbulent Elements (Timaeus).** Valentinus' Esoteric Treatise on the Doctrine of Gilgul.*** Surely no educated Jew ever believed the literal sense of this allegory -- namely, that \"the bodies of Jews deposited in foreignlands contain within them a principle of Soul which cannot rest, until by a process called the \"whirling of the Soul\" the immortalparticle reaches once more the sacred Soil of the \"Promised land.\" The meaning is evident to an occultist. The process was supposedto be accomplished by a kind of metempsychosis, the psychic spark being conveyed through bird, beast, fish, and the most minuteinsect. (See Royal Masonic Cyclo. Mackenzie.) The Allegory relates to the atoms of the body, which have each to pass through everyform before all reach the final state, which is the first starting point of the departure of every atom -- its primitive Laya State. But theprimitive meaning of Gilgoolem, or \"Revolution of Souls,\" was the idea of the re-incarnating Souls or Egos. \"All the Souls go into thegilgoolah,\" into a cyclic or revolving process; i.e., they all proceed on the cyclic path of re-births. Some Kabalists interpret thisdoctrine to mean only a kind of purgatory for the souls of the wicked. But this is not so.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 569 PANTHEISM VERSUS MATERIALISM.Soul (entirely distinct from immortal Spirit when the former is enshrined latent in it, as it is in every atomic speck), was composed of afine, tender essence, formed from the smoothest, roundest, and finest atoms.And this shows that the ancient Initiates, who were followed more or less closely by all profane antiquity, meant by the term \"ATOM,\"a Soul, a Genius or Angel, the first-born of the ever-concealed CAUSE of all causes; and in this sense their teachings becomecomprehensible. They claimed, as do their successors, the existence of Gods and Genii, angels or \"demons,\" not outside, orindependent of, the Universal Plenum, but within it. Only this Plenum, during the life-cycles, is infinite. They admitted and taught agood deal of that which modern Science teaches now --namely, the existence of a primordial \"World-stuff or Cosmic Substance,\" from"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"which worlds are formed, ever and eternally homogeneous, except during its periodic existence, when it differentiates its universaldiffusion throughout infinite space; and the gradual formation of sidereal bodies from it. They taught the revolution of the Heavens,the Earth's rotation, the Heliocentric System, and the Atomic Vortices -- Atoms -- in reality Souls and intelligences. But those\"Atomists\" were spiritual, most transcendental, and philosophical Pantheists. It is not they who would have ever conceived, or dreamtthat monstrous contrasted progeny, the nightmare of our modern civilized Race; namely -- inanimate material, self-guiding atoms, onthe one hand, and an extra-Cosmic God on the other.It may be useful to show what, in the teachings of the old Initiates, the Monad was, and what its origin.Modern exact Science, as soon as it began to grow out of its teens, perceived the great, and, to it, hitherto esoteric axiom, thatnothing -- whether in the spiritual, psychic, or physical realm of being -- could come into existence out of nothing. There is no causein the manifested universe without its adequate effects, whether in space or time; nor can there be an effect without its primal cause,which itself owes its existence to a still higher one -- the final and absolute cause having to remain to man for ever anincomprehensible CAUSELESS CAUSE. But even this is no solution, and must be viewed, if at all, from the highest philosophical andmetaphysical standpoints, otherwise the problem had better be left unapproached. It is an abstraction, on the verge of which humanreason -- however trained to metaphysical subtleties -- trembles, threatening to collapse. This may be demonstrated to any Europeanwho would undertake to solve the problem of existence by the articles of faith of the true Vedantin, for instance. Let him read andstudy the sublime teachings on the subject of Soul and Spirit, of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 570 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Sankaracharya (Viveka Chudamani)*, and the reader will realize what is now said.While the Christian is taught that the human soul is a breath of God -- being created by him for sempiternal existence, i.e., having abeginning, but no end (and therefore never to be called eternal) -- the Occult teaching says, \"Nothing is created, but is onlytransformed. Nothing can manifest itself in this universe -- from a globe down to a vague, rapid thought -- that was not in the universealready; everything on the subjective plane is an eternal IS; as everything on the objective plane is an ever becoming -- becausetransitory.\"The monad -- a truly \"indivisible thing,\" as defined by Good, who did not give it the sense we now do -- is here rendered as the Atmain conjunction with Buddhi and the higher Manas. This trinity is one and eternal, the latter being absorbed in the former at thetermination of all conditioned and illusive life. The monad, then, can be traced through the course of its pilgrimage and its changesof transitory vehicles only from the incipient stage of the manifested Universe. In Pralaya, or the intermediate period between twomanvantaras, it loses its name, as it loses it when the real ONE self of man merges into Brahm in cases of high Samadhi (the Turiyastate) or final Nirvana; \"when the disciple\" in the words of Sankara, \"having attained that primeval consciousness, absolute bliss, ofwhich the nature is truth, which is without form and action, abandons this illusive body that has been assumed by the atma just as anactor (abandons) the dress (put on).\" For Buddhi (the Anandamaya sheath) is but a mirror which reflects absolute bliss; and, moreover,that reflection itself is yet not free from ignorance, and is not the Supreme Spirit, being subject to conditions, being a spiritualmodification of Prakriti, and an effect; Atma alone is the one real and eternal substratum of all -- the essence and absolute knowledge-- the Kshetragna.** It is called in the Esoteric philosophy \"the One Witness,\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Translated for the Theosophist, by Mohini M.

For what can the sentence, \"there are three who bear witness: the Spirit and the Water andthe Blood\" -- mean, if they bear no relation to, or connection with, the more philosophical statement of the great Vedanta teacher,who, speaking of the sheaths (the principles in man) Jiva, Vignanamaya, etc., which are, in their physical manifestation, \"water andblood\" or life, adds that atma (spirit) alone is what remains after the [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 571 THE DIAMOND HEART.and, while it rests in Devachan, is referred to as \"the Three Witnesses to Karma.\"Atma (our seventh principle) being identical with the universal Spirit, and man being one with it in his essence, what is then theMonad proper?

The Anupadaka (or Dhyani-Buddhas) are thus identical with the Brahminical Manasaputra, \"mind-born sons\" -- whether of Brahma or either of the other twoTrimurtian Hypostases, hence identical also with the Rishis and Prajapatis. Thus, a passage is found in Anugita, which, readesoterically, shows plainly, though under another imagery, the same idea and system. It says: \"Whatever entities there are in thisworld, moveable or immoveable, they are the very first to be dissolved (at pralaya); and next the developments produced from theelements (from which the visible Universe is fashioned); and, after these developments (evolved entities), all the elements.

These great elements are in every way beyond the elements that make up the world (the grosselements). And he who is released even from these five elements (the tanmatras)* goes to the highest goal.\" \"The Lord Prajapati(Brahma) created all this by the mind only,\" i.e., by Dhyana, or abstract meditation and mystic powers like the Dhyani Buddhas (videsupra). Evidently then, these \"Brahmanas\" are identical with the Bodhisattvas (the terrestrial) of the heavenly Dhyani Buddhas. Both,as primordial, intelligent \"Elements,\" become the creators or the emanators of the monads destined to become human in that cycle;after which they evolve themselves, or, so to say, expand into their own selves as Bodhisattvas or Brahmanas, in heaven and earth, tobecome at last simple men --\"the creators of the world are born here, on earth again and again\" -- truly. In the Northern Buddhistsystem, or the popular exoteric religion, it is taught that every Buddha, while preaching the good law on earth, manifests himselfsimultaneously in three worlds: in the formless, as Dhyani Buddha, in the World of forms, as a Bodhisattva, and in the world of desire,the lowest (or our world) as a man. Esoterically the teaching differs: The divine, purely Adi-Buddhic monad manifests as the universalBuddhi (the Maha-buddhi or Mahat in Hindu philosophies) the spiritual, omniscient and omnipotent root of divine intelligence, thehighest anima mundi or the Logos. This descends \"like a flame spreading from the eternal Fire, immoveable, without increase ordecrease, ever the same to the end\" of the cycle of existence, and becomes universal life on the Mundane Plane. From this Plane ofconscious Life shoot out, like seven fiery tongues, the Sons of Light (the logoi of Life); then the Dhyani-Buddhas of contemplation: theconcrete forms of their formless Fathers -- the Seven Sons of Light, still themselves, to whom may be applied the Brahmanical mysticphrase: \"Thou art 'THAT' -- Brahm.\" It is from these Dhyani-Buddhas that emanate their chhayas (Shadows) the Bodhisattvas of thecelestial realms, the prototypes of the super-terrestrial Bodhisattvas, and of the terrestrial Buddhas, and finally of men. The \"SevenSons of Light\" are also called \"Stars.\"The star under which a human Entity is born, says the Occult teaching, will remain for ever its star, throughout the whole cycle of itsincarnations in one Manvantara.

Atma is not-Spirit inits final Parabrahmic state, Iswara or Logos is Spirit; or, as Occultism explains, it is a compound unity of manifested living Spirits, theparent-source and nursery of all the mundane and terrestrial monads, plus their divine reflection, which emanate from, and returninto, the Logos, each in the culmination of its time. There are seven chief groups of such Dhyan Chohans, which groups will be foundand recognised in every religion, for they are the primeval SEVEN Rays. Humanity, occultism teaches us, is divided into seven distinctgroups and their sub-divisions, mental, spiritual, and physical.* The monad, then, viewed as ONE, is above the seventh principle (inKosmos and man), and as a triad, it is the direct radiant progeny of the said compound UNIT, not the breath (and special creation outof nihil) of \"God,\" as that unit is called; for such an idea is quite unphilosophical, and degrades Deity, dragging it down to a finite,attributive condition.

It was simplyto show that the group of his disciples and followers attracted to Him belonged to the same Dhyani Buddha, \"Star,\" or \"Father,\" againof the same planetary realm and division as He did. It is the knowledge of this occult doctrine that found expression in the review of\"The Idyll of the White Lotus,\" when Mr. T. Subba Row wrote: \"Every Buddha meets at his last initiation all the great adepts whoreached Buddhahood during the preceding ages . . . every class of adepts has its own bond of spiritual communion which knits themtogether. . . . . The only possible and effectual way of entering into such brotherhood . . . . is by bringing oneself within the influenceof the Spiritual light which radiates from one's own Logos. I may further point out here . . . . that such communion is only possiblebetween persons whose souls derive their life and sustenance from the same divine RAY, and that, as seven distinct rays radiate fromthe 'Central Spiritual Sun,' all adepts and Dhyan Chohans are divisible into seven classes, each of which is guided, controlled, andovershadowed by one of the seven forms or manifestations of the divine Wisdom.\" (\"Theosophist,\" Aug., 1886.)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The now universal error of attributing to the ancients the knowledge of only seven planets, simply because they mentioned noothers, is based on the same general ignorance of their occult doctrines. The question is not whether they were, or were not, aware ofthe existence of the later discovered planets; but whether the reverence paid by them to the four exoteric and three secret great gods -- the star-angels, had not some special reason. The writer ventures to say there was such a reason, and it is this. Had they known of asmany planets as we do now (and this question can hardly be decided at present, either way), they would have still connected withtheir religious worship only the seven, because these seven are directly and specially connected with our earth, or, using esotericphraseology, with our septenary ring of spheres. (See supra.)** It is the same, only still more metaphysical idea, as that of the Christian Trinity -- \"Three in One\" -- i.e., the Universal \"over-Spirit,\"manifesting on the two higher planes, those of Buddhi and Mahat; and these are the three hypostases, metaphysical, but neverpersonal.*** The identity, and at the same time the illusive differentiation of the Angel-Monad and the Human-Monad is shown by thefollowing sentences: \"My Father is greater than I\" (John xiv. 26); \"Glorify your Father who is in Heaven\" (Matt. v. 16); \"The righteouswill shine in the kingdom of their Father\" (not our Father) (Matt. xiii. 43) \"Know ye not ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit ofGod dwelleth in you?

In order to avoid creating new misconceptions, let it be stated that among the three secret orbs (or star-angels) neitherUranus nor Neptune entered; not only because they were unknown under these names to the ancient Sages, but because they, as allother planets, however many there may be, are the gods and guardians of other septenary chains of globes within our systems.Nor do the two last discovered great planets depend entirely on the Sun like the rest of the planets. Otherwise, how explain the factthat Neptune receives 900 times less light than our Earth, and Uranus 390 times less, and that their satellites show a peculiarity ofinverse rotation found in no other planets of the Solar System. At any rate, what we say applies to Uranus, though recently the factbegins again to be disputed.This subject will, of course, be considered mere vagary by all those who confuse the universal order of being with their own systems ofclassification. Here, however, simple facts from Occult teachings are stated, to be either accepted or rejected, as the case may be.There are details which, on account of their great metaphysical abstractions, cannot be entered upon. Hence, we merely state thatonly seven of our planets are as intimately related to our globe, as the Sun is to all[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* These are planets accepted for purposes of judicial astrology only. The astrotheogonical division differed from this one. The Sun,being a central star and no planet, stands in more occult and mysterious relations with its seven planets of our globe than is generallyknown. The Sun was, therefore, considered the great Father of all the Seven \"Fathers,\" which accounts for the variations foundbetween seven and eight great gods of the Chaldean and other countries. Neither the earth nor the moon -- its satellite -- nor yet stars,for another reason -- were anything else than substitutes for esoteric purposes. Yet, even with the Sun and the Moon thrown out of thecalculation, the ancients seem to have known of seven planets. How many more are known to us, so far, if we throw out the Earth andMoon? Seven, and no more: Seven primary or principal planets, the rest planetoids rather than planets.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 576 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the bodies subject to him in his system. Of these bodies the poor little number of primary and secondary planets known to astronomy,looks wretched enough, in truth.* Therefore, it stands to reason that there are a great number of planets, small and large, that havenot been discovered yet, but of the existence of which ancient astronomers -- all of them initiated adepts -- must have certainly beenaware. But, as their relation to the gods was sacred, it had to remain arcane, as also the names of various other planets and stars.Besides which, even the Roman Catholic theology speaks of \"seventy planets that preside over the destinies of the nations of thisglobe\"; and, save the erroneous application, there is more truth in this tradition than in exact modern astronomy. The seventy planetsare connected with the seventy elders of the people of Israel (Numb. 11, 16) because the regents of these planets are meant, not theorbs themselves; and the word seventy is a play and a blind upon the 7 x 7 of the subdivisions. Each people and nation, as saidalready, has its direct Watcher, Guardian and Father in Heaven -- a Planetary Spirit. We are willing to leave their own national God,Jehovah, to the descendants of Israel, the worshippers of Sabaoth or SATURN; for, indeed, the monads of the people chosen by himare his own, and the Bible has never made a secret of it. Only the text of the English (Protestant) Bible is, in disagreement, as usual,with those of the Septuagint and the Vulgate. Thus, while in the former one reads (in Deuter. xxxii., 8 and 9) \"When the MOST HIGH(not Jehovah) divided to the nations their inheritance . . . he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children ofIsrael,\" in the Septuagint the text reads \"according to the number of the Angels\" (Planet-Angels), which is more concordant with truthand fact. Moreover, all the texts agree that \"the Lord's (Jehovah) portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance\" (Deut. xxxii.9); and this settles the question. The \"Lord\" Jehovah took for his portion Israel -- what have other nations to do with that particularnational Deity? Let then, the \"angel Gabriel\" watch over Iran and \"Mikael-Jehovah\" over the Hebrews. These are not the gods of othernations, and it is difficult to see why Christians[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* When one remembers that under the powerful telescope of Sir W.

On its way to the Earth, as on its way backfrom the Earth, each soul born in, and from, the \"Boundless Light,\"* had to pass through the seven planetary regions both ways. Thepure Dhyani and Devas of the oldest religions had become, in course of time, with the Zoroastrians, the Seven Devs, the ministers ofAhriman, \"each chained to his planet\" (see Origen's Copy of the Chart); with the Brahmins, the Asuras and some of its Rishis -- good,"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"bad and indifferent; and among the Egyptian Gnostics it was Thoth or (Hermes) who was the chief of the seven whose names aregiven by Origen as Adonai, genius of the Sun; Tao, of the Moon; Eloi, of Jupiter; Sabao, of Mars; Orai, of Venus; Astaphai, ofMercury; and Ildabaoth (Jehovah), of Saturn. Finally, the Pistis-Sophia, which the greatest modern authority on exoteric Gnosticbeliefs, the late Mr. C. W. King, refers to as \"that precious monument of Gnosticism,\" -- this old document echoes, while distorting it tosectarian purposes, the archaic belief of the ages. The Astral Rulers of the Spheres (the planets) create the monads (the Souls) fromtheir own substance out of the \"tears of their eyes, and the sweat of their torments,\" endowing the monads with a spark of the DivineLight, which is their substance. It will be shown in Book II. why these \"Lords of the Zodiac and Spheres\" have been transformed bysectarian theology into the rebellious angels of the Christians, who took them from the Seven Devs of the Magi, without understandingthe significance of the allegory. (Vide Part II., \"On the Seven Souls,\" and Section xv. in this Part, \"GODS, MONADS AND ATOMS\").As usual, that which is and was from its beginning divine, pure, and spiritual in its earliest unity, became, by reason of itsdifferentiation by the distorted prism of man's conceptions, human and impure, as reflecting man's own sinful nature. Thus, in time,the planet Saturn became reviled by the worshippers of other \"gods.\" The nations born under Saturn -- the Jewish, for instance -- withwhom he had become Jehovah, after having been held as a son of Saturn, or Ilda-Baoth, by the Ophites, and in the book of Jasher --were eternally fighting with those born under Jupiter, Mercury, or any other planet, except Saturn-Jehovah; genealogies andprophecies notwithstanding, Jesus the initiate (or Jehoshua) -- the type from whom the \"historical\" Jesus was[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* C.

I speak the things which I have seen with my Father; and ye do the things which ye heard fromyour Father. . . . . Ye do the works of your Father. . . . . Ye are of your Father, the Devil. . . . . He was a murderer from the beginning,and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When one speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own; for his father also is a liarand the father thereof,\" etc., etc.That \"Father\" of the Pharisees was Jehovah, because identical with Cain, Saturn, Vulcan, etc. -- the planet under which they wereborn, and the God whom they worshipped. Evidently there must be an occult meaning sought in these words and admonitions,however mistranslated, since they are pronounced by one who threatened with hell-fire anyone who says simply raca (fool) to hisbrother (Matthew v., 22). And evidently, again, the planets are not merely spheres, twinkling in Space, and made to shine for nopurpose, but the domains of various beings with whom the profane are so far unacquainted; nevertheless, having a mysterious,unbroken, and powerful connection with men and globes. Every heavenly body is the temple of a god, and these gods themselves arethe temples of GOD, the Unknown \"Not Spirit.\" There is nothing profane in the Universe. All Nature is a consecrated place, as Youngsays:--\"Each of these Stars is a religious house.\" . . . .Thus can all exoteric religions be shown the falsified copies of the esoteric teaching. It is the priesthood which has to be heldresponsible for the reaction in favour of materialism of our day. It is by worshiping and enforcing on the masses the worship of theshells -- personified for purposes of allegory -- of pagan ideals, that the latest exoteric religion has made of Western lands aPandemonium, in which the higher classes worship the golden calf, and the lower and ignorant masses are made to worship an idolwith feet of clay.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Abraham and Saturn are identical in astro-symbology, and he is the forefather of the Jehovistic Jews.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 579 ANTIQUITY OUR GREAT MASTER.XII.ANCIENT THOUGHT IN MODERN DRESS.MODERN SCIENCE IS ANCIENT THOUGHT DISTORTED, and no more.

We do not say that we deny the theory, but assert only that it needs completion and re-arrangement. But the Occultists are by no means the only heretics in this respect; for Mr. Robert Hunt, F.R.S., remarks, in hisResearches on Light in its Chemical Relations, that:--. . . . \"the undulatory theory does not account for the results of his experiments. Sir David Brewster, in his Treatise on Optics, showing'that the colours of vegetable life arise . . . . from a specific attraction which the particles of these bodies exercise over the differently-coloured rays of light,' and that 'it is by the light of the sun that the coloured juices of plants are elaborated, that the colours of bodiesare changed, etc. . . . .' remarks that it is not easy to allow 'that such effects can be produced by the mere vibration of an etherealmedium.' And he is forced, he says, 'by this class of facts, to reason as if light was material (?).' Professor Josiah P. Cooke, of HarvardUniversity, says that he 'cannot agree . . . . with those who regard the wave-theory of light as an established principle of science.'**Herschell's doctrine, that the intensity of light, in effect of each undulation, 'is inversely as the square of the distance from theluminous body,' if correct, damages a good deal, if it does not kill the undulatory theory. That he is right, was proved repeatedly byexperiments with photometers; and though it begins to be much doubted, the undulatory theory is still alive.\" (\"Isis Unveiled.\")To this remark of Sir W. Brewster -- \"forced to reason as if light was material\" -- there is a good deal to reply. Light, in one sense, iscertainly as material as electricity itself is. And if electricity is not material, if it is only \"a mode of motion,\" how is it that it can bestored up in Faure's accumulators? Helmholtz says that electricity must be as atomic as matter; and Mr. W. Crookes, F.R.S., supportedthe view in his address to the Chemical Section of the British Association, of which he was President (at Birmingham, 1886). This iswhat Helmholtz says (in his Faraday Lectures, 1881):--\"If we accept the hypothesis that the elementary substances are composed of atoms, we cannot avoid concluding that electricity also,positive as well as negative, is divided into definite elementary portions, which behave like atoms of electricity.\"Here we have to repeat that which was already said in Section IX: there is but one science that can henceforth direct modern researchinto the one path which will lead to the discovery of the whole, hitherto[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Timaeus.\"** Modern Chemistry.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 581 A CHASE AFTER THE PRIMAL MATTER."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"occult, truth, and it is the youngest of all -- chemistry, as it now stands reformed.

The word is scarcely a new coinage, for 600 years ago Roger Bacon wrote in his Arte Chymiae, \"The elements are madeout of [[hyle]] and every element is converted into the nature of another element.\"The Knowledge of Roger Bacon did not come to this wonderful old magician** by inspiration, but because he studied ancient workson[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Mr. Crookes' \"Presidential Address\" at Birmingham. \"There is but one unknown -- the ultimate substratum of Spirit (Space).

These are the words:\"Many of these mystics, by following what they were taught by some treatises, secretly preserved from one generation to another,achieved discoveries which would not be despised even in our modern days of exact sciences. Roger Bacon, the friar, was laughed atas a quack, and is now generally numbered among 'pretenders' to magic art; but his discoveries were nevertheless accepted, and arenow used by those who ridicule him the most.

But see what Mr. Crookes says of protyle, next neighbour to theunconscious Mulaprakriti of the Occultists:--. . . . . \"Let us start at the moment when the first element came into existence. Before this time, matter, as we know it, was not. It isequally impossible to conceive of matter without energy, as of energy without matter; from one point of view both are convertibleterms. Before the birth of atoms, all those forms of energy, which become evident when matter acts upon matter, could not haveexisted* -- they were locked up in the protyle as latent potentialities only. Coincident with the creation of atoms, all those attributesand properties, which form the means of discriminating one chemical element from another, start into existence fully endowed withenergy.\" (Presidential Address, p. 16.)With every respect due to the great knowledge of the lecturer, the Occultist would put it otherwise. They would say that no atom isever \"created,\" for the atoms are eternal within the bosom of the One Atom, -- \"the atom of atoms\" -- viewed during Manvantara as theJagad-Yoni the material causative womb of the world. Pradhana (unmodified matter), that which is the first form of Prakriti, or materialvisible, as well as invisible nature, and Purusha, spirit, are eternally one; and they are Nirupadhi, (without adventitious qualities orattributes) only during Pralaya, and when beyond any of the planes of consciousness of existence. The atom, as known to modernscience, is inseparable from Purusha, which is spirit, but is now called \"Energy\" in Science. The protyle atom has not beencomminuted or subtilized: it has simply passed into that plane, which is no plane, but the eternal state of everything beyond theplanes of illusion. Both Purusha and Pradhana are immutable and unconsumable, or Aparinamin and Avyaya, in eternity; and bothduring the Mayavic periods may be referred to as Vyaya and Parinamin, or that which can expand, pass away and disappear, and is\"modifiable.\" In this sense Purusha, must of course, be held distinct in our conceptions from Parabrahmam. Nevertheless that, which iscalled \"energy\" or \"force\" in Science and has been explained as a dual Force by Metcalfe, is never, in fact, and cannot be energyalone; for it is the substance of the world, its soul, the all-permeant \"Sarvaga,\" in conjunction with Kala \"time.\" The three are thetrinity in one, during Manvantara, the all-potential Unity, which acts on the plane of illusion (Maya) as three distinct things.

He continues, speaking of the evolution of atoms:--\". . . . Let us pause at the end of the first complete vibration and examine the result. We have already found the elements of water,ammonia, carbonic acid, the atmosphere, plant and animal life, phosphorus for the brain, salt for the seas, clay for the solid earth . . .phosphates and silicates sufficient for a world and inhabitants not so very different from what we enjoy at the present day. True thehuman inhabitants would have to live in a state of more than Arcadian simplicity, and the absence of calcic phosphate would beawkward as far as the bone is concerned* . . . At the lower end of our curve . . . we see a great hiatus . . . This oasis, and the blankswhich precede and follow it, may be referred with much probability to the particular way in which our Earth developed into a memberof our solar system. If this be so, it may be that on our Earth only these blanks occur, and not generally throughout the universe.\"This justifies several assertions in the Occult works.Firstly, \"that neither stars nor the sun can be said to be constituted of those terrestrial elements with which the chemist is familiar,though they are all present in the sun's outward robes -- and a host more of elements so far unknown to science.\"Secondly, that our globe has its own special laboratory on the far-away outskirts of its atmosphere, crossing which, every atom andmolecule change and differentiate from their primordial nature.And Thirdly, that though no element present on our earth could ever be possibly found wanting in the sun, there are many otherswhich have either not reached, or not as yet been discovered on, our globe. \"Some may be missing in certain stars and heavenlybodies in the process of formation; or, though present in them, these elements, on account of their present state, may not respond asyet to the usual scientific tests.\"** Mr. Crookes speaks of an element of still lower atomic weight than hydrogen, an element purelyhypothetical as far as our earth is concerned . . . though existing in abundance in the chromosphere of the Sun -- the helium. OccultScience adds that not one of the elements regarded by chemistry as such really deserves the name.Again we find Mr. Crookes speaking with approbation of \"Dr. Carnelly's weighty argument in favour of the compound nature of the so-called elements, from their analogy to the compound radicles! \" Hitherto,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is just the existence of such worlds in other planes of consciousness that is claimed by the Occultist. The secret science teachesthat the primitive race was boneless. (See Book II.); and that there are (to us) invisible worlds, peopled as our own, besides thepopulations of Dhyan Chohans.** \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" p. 258 et seq.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 584 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.alchemy alone succeeded within the historical periods, and in the so-called civilized countries, in obtaining a real element, or aparticle of homogeneous matter, the Mysterium Magnum of Paracelsus. But then it was before Lord Bacon's day.*\". . . Let us now turn to the upper portion of the scheme. With hydrogen of atomic weight = 1, there is little room for other elements,save, perhaps, for hypothetical Helium. But what if we get 'through the looking-glass,' and cross the zero line in search of newprinciples -- what shall we find on the other side of zero? Dr. Carnelly asks for an element of negative atomic weight; here is ampleroom and verge enough for a shadow series of such unsubstantialities. Helmholtz says that electricity is probably as atomic as matter;is electricity one of the negative elements, and the luminiferous ether another? Matter, as we now know it, does not here exist; theforms of energy which are apparent in the motions of matter are as yet only latent possibilities. A substance of negative weight is notinconceivable.** But can we form a clear conception of a body which combines with other bodies in proportions expressible bynegative qualities?\"***\"A genesis of the elements such as is here sketched out would not be confined to our little solar system, but would probably follow thesame general sequence of events in every centre of energy now visible as a star.\"\"Before the birth of atoms to gravitate towards one another, no pressure could be exercised; but at the outskirts of the fire-mist sphere,within which all is protyle -- at the shell on which the tremendous forces involved in the birth of a chemical element exert full sway --the fierce heat would be accompanied by gravitation sufficient to keep the newly-born elements from flying off into space.

In this space the lion and the lamb would lie down together; phosphorus andoxygen would mix without union; hydrogen and chlorine would show no tendency to closer bonds; and even fluorine, that[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Says Mr. Crookes in the same address: \"The first riddle which we encounter in chemistry is: 'What are the elements?' Of the attemptshitherto made to define or explain an element, none satisfy the demands of the human intellect. The text books tell us that anelement is 'a body which has not been decomposed ''that it is 'a something to which we can add, but from which we can take nothing,'or 'a body which increases in weight with every chemical change.' Such definitions are doubly unsatisfactory: they are provisional, andmay cease to-morrow to be applicable in any given case. They take their stand, not on any attribute of the things to be defined, buton the limitations of human power: they are confessions of intellectual impotence.\"** And the lecturer quotes Sir George Airy, who says (in Faraday's Life and Letters Vol. II., p. 354), \"I can easily conceive that there areplenty of bodies about us not subject to this intermutual action, and therefore not subject to the law of gravitation.\"*** The Vedantic philosophy conceives of such; but then it is not physics, but metaphysics, called by Mr. Tyndall \"poetry\" and \"fiction.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 585 THE \"SEVENTH\" IN CHEMISTRY.energetic gas which chemists have only isolated within the last month or two, would float about free and uncombined.\"\"Outside this space of free atomic matter would be another shell, in which the formed chemical elements would have cooled down tothe combination point, and the sequence of events so graphically described by Mr. Mattieu Williams in \"The Fuel of the Sun\" wouldnow take place, culminating in the solid earth and the commencement of geological time\" (p. 19).This is, in a strictly scientific, but beautiful language, the description of the evolution of the differentiated Universe in the secretteachings. The learned gentleman closes his address in words, every sentence of which is like a flash of light from beyond the darkveil of materiality, hitherto thrown upon the exact sciences, and a step forward towards the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Occult. (Vide §XV., \"Gods, Monads, and Atoms.\") Thus he says:--\"We have glanced at the difficulty of defining an element; we have noticed, too, the revolt of many leading physicists and chemistsagainst the ordinary acceptation of the term element; we have weighed the improbability of their eternal existence,* or theirorigination by chance. As a remaining alternative, we have suggested their origin by a process of evolution like that of the heavenlybodies according to Laplace, and the plants and animals of our globe according to Lamarck, Darwin, and Wallace.** In the generalarray of the elements, as known to us, we have seen a striking approximation to that of the organic world.*** In lack of direct evidenceof the decomposition of any element, we have sought and found indirect evidence . . . . We have next glanced at the view of thegenesis of the elements; and lastly we have reviewed a scheme of their origin suggested by Professor Reynold's method of illustratingthe periodic classification**** . . . Summing up all the above considerations we cannot,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the form they are now, we conceive?** And to Kapila and Manu -- especially and originally.*** Here is a scientific corroboration of the eternal law of correspondences and analogy.**** This method of illustrating the periodic law in the classification of elements is, in the words of Mr. Crookes, proposed by ProfessorEmerson Reynolds, of Dublin University, who . . . . \"points out that in each period, the general properties of the elements vary fromone to another, with approximate regularity until we reach the seventh member, which is in more or less striking contrast with the firstelement of the same period, as well as with the first of the next. Thus chlorine, the seventh member of Mendeleef's third period,contrasts sharply with both sodium, the first member of the same series, and with potassium, the first member of the next series; whilston the other hand, sodium and potassium are closely analogous. The six elements, whose atomic weights intervene between sodiumand potassium, vary in properties, step by step, until chlorine, the contrast to sodium, is reached. But from chlorine to potassium, theanalogue of sodium, there is a change in properties per saltum. . . . . If we thus recognise a contrast in properties -- more or lessdecided -- between the first and the last members of each series, we can scarcely help admitting the existence of a point of meanvariation within each system. In general the fourth element of each series possesses the property we might expect a transition-elementto exhibit. . . . . Thus for the purpose of graphic translation, Professor Reynolds considers that the fourth member of a period -- silicon,for example -- may be placed at the apex of a symmetrical [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 586 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"indeed, venture to assert positively that our so-called elements have been evolved from one primordial matter; but we may contendthat the balance of evidence, I think, fairly weighs in favour of this speculation.\"Thus inductive Science, in its Branches of Astronomy, Physics, and Chemistry, while advancing timidly towards the conquest ofNature's secrets in her final effects on our terrestrial plane, recedes to the days of Anaxagoras and the Chaldees in its discoveries of (a)the origin of our phenomenal world, and (b) the modes of formation of the bodies that compose the universe. And having to turn backfor their cosmogonical hypotheses to the beliefs of the earliest philosophers, and the systems of the latter -- systems that were allbased on the teachings of a universal secret doctrine with regard to the primeval matter with its properties, functions, and laws, -- havewe not the right to hope that the day is not far off when Science will show a better appreciation of the wisdom of the ancients than ithas hitherto done?No doubt Occult philosophy could learn a good deal from exact modern science; but the latter, on the other hand, might profit byancient learning in more than one way, and chiefly in Cosmogony. For[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] curve, which shall represent for that particular period, the direction in which the propertiesof the series of elements vary with rising atomic weights.Now, the writer humbly confesses complete ignorance of modern chemistry and its mysteries. But she is pretty well acquainted with theOccult doctrine with regard to correspondences of types and antitypes in nature, and perfect analogy as a fundamental law inOccultism. Hence she ventures a remark which will strike every Occultist, however it may be derided by orthodox Science. This methodof illustrating the periodic law in the behaviour of elements, whether or not still a hypothesis in chemistry, is a law in Occult Sciences.Every well-read Occultist knows that the seventh and fourth members -- whether in a septenary chain of worlds, the septenary hierarchyof angels, or in the constitution of man, animal, plant, or mineral atom -- that the seventh and fourth members, we say, in thegeometrically and mathematically uniform workings of the immutable laws of Nature, always play a distinct and specific part in theseptenary system. From the stars twinkling high in heaven, to the sparks flying asunder from the rude fire built by the savage in hisforest; from the hierarchies and the essential constitution of the Dhyan Chohans -- organized for diviner apprehensions and a loftierrange of perception than the greatest Western psychologist ever dreamed of, down to Nature's classification of species among thehumblest insects; finally from worlds to atoms, everything in the universe, from great to small, proceeds in its spiritual and physicalevolution, cyclically and septennially, showing its seventh and fourth number (the latter the turning point) behaving in the same wayas shown in that periodic law of atoms. Nature never proceeds per saltum. Therefore, when Mr. Crookes remarks to this that he doesnot \"wish to infer that the gaps in Mendeleef's table, and in this graphic representation of it (the diagram showing the evolution ofatoms) necessarily mean that there are elements actually existing to fill up the gaps; these gaps may only mean that at the birth ofthe elements there was an easy potentiality of the formation of an element which would fit into the place\" -- an Occultist wouldrespectfully remark to him that the latter hypothesis can only hold good, if the septenary arrangement of atoms is not interfered with.This is the one law, and an infallible method that must always lead to success, one who follows it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 587 PURANAS VERSUS ROYAL SOCIETY.instance, the mystical signification, alchemical and transcendental, of the many imponderable substances that fill interplanetaryspace, and which, interpenetrating each, are the direct cause, at the lower end, of the production of natural phenomena manifestingthrough vibration (so-called). The knowledge of the real (not the hypothetical) nature of Ether, or rather of the Akasa, and othermysteries, in short, can alone lead to the knowledge of Forces. It is that substance against which the materialistic school of thephysicists rebels with such fury, especially in France,* and which exact Science has to advocate notwithstanding. They cannot makeaway with it without incurring the risk, like a modern Samson, of pulling down the pillars of the Temple of Science, and getting buriedunder its roof.The theories built upon the rejection of Force outside and independent of Matter pure and simple, have been all shown fallacious.They do not, and cannot, cover the ground, and many of the scientific data are thus proved unscientific. \"Ether produced Sound\" issaid in the Puranas, and the statement is laughed at. It is the vibrations in the air, we are corrected. And what is air? Could it exist ifthere were no etheric medium in Space to buoy up its molecules? The case stands simply thus. Materialism cannot admit theexistence of anything outside matter, because with the acceptance of an imponderable Force -- the source and head of all thephysical Forces -- other intelligent Forces would have to be admitted virtually, and that would lead Science very far. For it would haveto accept as a sequel the presence in Man of a still more spiritual power -- entirely independent, for once, of any kind of matterphysicists know anything about. Hence, apart from an hypothetical ether of Space and gross physical bodies, the whole Sidereal andunseen Space is, in the sight of the materialists, one boundless void in nature -- blind, unintelligent, useless.And now the next question is: What is that Cosmic Substance, and how far can one go to suspect its nature or to wrench from it itssecrets, and thus feel justified in giving it a NAME? How far, especially, has modern Science gone in the direction of those secrets,and what it is doing to solve them. The latest hobby of Science, the \"Nebular Theory,\" may afford us some answer to this question.Let us then examine the credentials of the NEBULAR THEORY.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* A group of electricians has just protested against the new theory of Clausius, the famous professor of the University of Bonn. Thecharacter of the protest is shown in the signature, which has \"Jules Bourdin, in the name of the group of Electricians, which had the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"honour of being introduced to Professor Clausius in 1881, and whose war-cry (cri de ralliement) is A bas l'Ether\" -- down with ether,even; they want Universal Void, you see!------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 588 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.XIII.SCIENTIFIC AND ESOTERIC EVIDENCE FOR, AND OBJECTIONS TO, THE MODERN NEBULAR THEORY.OF late Esoteric Cosmogony has been frequently opposed by the phantom of this theory and its ensuing hypotheses. \"Can this mostscientific teaching be denied by your adepts?\" it is asked. \"Not entirely,\" is the reply, \"but the admissions of the men of Sciencethemselves kill it; and there remains nothing for the adepts to deny.\"To make of Science an integral whole necessitates, indeed, the study of spiritual and psychic, as well as physical Nature. Otherwise itwill ever be like the anatomy of man, discussed of old by the profane from the point of view of his shell-side and in ignorance of theinterior work. Even Plato, the greatest philosopher of his country, became guilty, before his initiation, of such statements as thatliquids pass into the stomach through the lungs. Without metaphysics, as Mr. H. J. Slack says, real science is inadmissible.The nebulae exist; yet the nebular theory is wrong. A nebula exists in a state of entire elemental dissociation. It is gaseous and --something else besides, which can hardly be connected with gases, as known to physical science; and it is self-luminous. But that isall. The sixty-two \"coincidences\" enumerated by Professor Stephen Alexander,* confirming the nebular theory, may all be explainedby esoteric science; though, as this is not an astronomical work, the refutations are not attempted at present. Laplace and Faye comenearer to the correct theory than any; but of the speculations of Laplace there remains little in the present theory except its generalfeatures. Nevertheless, \"there is in Laplace's theory,\" says John Stuart Mill, \"nothing hypothetical; it is an example of legitimatereasoning from present effect to its past cause; it assumes nothing more than that objects which really exist, obey the laws which areknown to be obeyed by all terrestrial objects resembling them.\" (System of Logic, p. 229).This from such an eminent logician as Mill was, would be valuable, if it could only be proved that \"terrestrial objects resembling . . .\"celestial objects at such a distance as the nebulae are -- resemble those objects in reality, not alone in appearance.Another of the fallacies from the Occult stand-point, which are embodied in the modern theory as it now stands, is the hypothesis thatthe planets were all detached from the Sun; that they are bone of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Smithsonian Contributions,\" xxi., Art. 1, pp. 79-97.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 589 \"SO FAR SHALT THOU GO . . . .\"his bone, and flesh of his flesh; whereas, the Sun and planets are only co-uterine brothers, having had the same nebular origin, onlyin a different mode from that postulated by modern astronomy.The many objections raised against the homogeneity of original diffuse matter, on the ground of the uniformity in the composition ofthe fixed stars, by some opponents of the modern nebular theory, do not affect the question of that homogeneity at all, but only thesaid theory. Our solar nebula may not be completely homogeneous, or, rather, it may fail to reveal itself as such to the astronomers,and yet be de facto homogeneous. The stars do differ in their constituent materials and even exhibit elements quite unknown onearth; nevertheless, this does not affect the point that primeval matter -- i.e., as it appeared even in its first differentiation from its layacondition* -- is yet to this day homogeneous, at immense distances, in the depths of infinitude, and likewise at points not far removedfrom the outskirts of our solar system.Finally, there does not exist one single fact brought forward by the learned objectors against the \"nebular theory,\" (false as it is, andhence, illogically enough, fatal to the hypothesis of the homogeneity of matter,) that can withstand criticism. One error leads intoanother. A false premise will naturally lead to a false conclusion, although an inadmissible inference does not necessarily affect thevalidity of the major proposition of the syllogism. Thus, one may leave every side-issue and inference from the evidence of spectra,and lines, as simply provisional for the present, and abandon all matters of detail to physical science. The duty of the Occultist lieswith the Soul and Spirit of Cosmic Space, not merely with its illusive appearance and behaviour. That of official physical science is toanalyze and study its shell -- the Ultima Thule of the Universe and man, in the opinion of Materialism.With the latter, Occultism has nought to do. It is only with the theories of such men of learning as Kepler, Kant, Oersted, and Sir W.Herschell, who believed in a Spiritual world, that Occult Cosmogony might treat, and attempt a satisfactory compromise. But the viewsof those physicists differed vastly from the latest modern speculations. Kant and Herschell had in their mind's eye speculations uponthe origin and the final destiny, as well as the present aspect, of the Universe, from a far more philosophical and psychic standpoint;whereas modern Cosmology and Astronomy now repudiate anything like research into the mysteries of being. The result is what mightbe expected: complete failure and inextricable contradictions in the thousand and one varieties of so-called scientific theories, and inthis theory as in all others.The nebular hypothesis, involving the theory of the existence of a"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Beyond the zero-line of action.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 590 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.primeval matter, diffused in a nebulous condition, is of no modern date in astronomy as everyone knows. Anaximenes, of the Ionianschool, had already taught that the sidereal bodies were formed through the progressive condensation of a primordial pregeneticmatter, which had almost a negative weight, and was spread out through Space in an extremely sublimated condition.Tycho Brahe, who viewed the Milky Way as an ethereal substance, thought the new star that appeared in Cassiopoeia, in 1572, hadbeen formed out of that matter. (\"Progymnasmata\" p. 795.) Kepler believed the star of 1606 had been likewise formed out of theethereal substance that fills the universe (\"De stella nova in pede Serpentarii,\" p. 115). He attributed to that same ether the apparitionof a luminous ring around the moon, during the total eclipse of the sun observed at Naples in 1605. (\"Hypotheses Cosmogoniques,\" C.Wolf.) Still later, in 1714, -- the existence of a self-luminous matter was recognised by Halley (\"Philosophical Transactions\"). Finally,the journal of this name published in 1811 the famous hypothesis on the transformation of the nebulae into stars, by the eminentastronomer, Sir W. Herschell (See \"Philosophical Transactions,\" of 1811, p. 269, et seq.), after which the nebular theory was acceptedby the Royal Academies.In \"Five years of Theosophy,\" on p. 245, an article headed \"Do the Adepts deny the Nebular Theory?\" may be read. The answer theregiven is \"No; they do not deny its general propositions, nor the approximative truth of the scientific hypotheses. They only deny thecompleteness of the present, as well as the entire error of the many so-called \"exploded\" old theories, which, during the last century,have followed each other in such rapid succession.\"This was proclaimed at the time \"an evasive answer.\" Such disrespect to official science, it was argued, must be justified by thepresentation, to replace the orthodox speculation, of another theory more complete than theirs, and having a firmer ground to standupon. To this there is but one reply; it is useless to give out isolated theories with regard to things embodied in a whole andconsecutive system, which, when separated from the main body of the teaching, would necessarily lose their vital coherence and thusdo no good when studied independently. To be able to appreciate and accept the occult views on the nebular theory, one has tostudy the whole esoteric cosmogonical system. And the time has hardly arrived for the astronomers to be asked to accept Fohat andthe divine Builders. Even the undeniably correct surmises of Sir W. Herschell], that had nothing \"supernatural\" in them, about the sunbeing called \"globe of fire\" (perhaps) metaphorically, and his early speculations about the nature of that which is now called theNasmyth willow-leaf theory -- caused that most eminent of all astro-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 591 FORCES ARE EMANATIONS.nomers to be smiled at by other, far less eminent colleagues, who saw and now see in his ideas only \"imaginative and fancifultheories.\" Before the whole esoteric system could be given out and appreciated by the astronomers, they would have to return to someof those \"antiquated ideas,\" not only to those of Herschell, but to the dreams of the oldest Hindu astronomers, and to abandon theirown theories, none the less \"fanciful\" because they have appeared in one case nearly 80 years and in the other many thousands ofyears later. Foremost of all they would have to repudiate the ideas on the Sun's solidity and incandescence; the sun \"glowing\" mostundeniably, but not \"burning.\" Then it is stated, with regard to Sir W. Herschell's view that those \"objects,\" as he called the \"willowleaves,\" are the immediate sources of the solar light and heat. And though the esoteric teaching does not regard these as he did --namely, organisms as partaking of the nature of life,\" for the Solar \"Beings\" will hardly place themselves within telescopic focus -- yetit asserts that the whole Universe is full of such \"organisms,\" conscious and active according to the proximity or distance of their planesto, or from, our plane of consciousness; and that finally the great astronomer was right in saying that \"we do not know that vital actionis competent to develop at once heat, light, and electricity\" while speculating on those supposed \"organisms.\" For, at the risk of beinglaughed at by the whole world of physicists, the Occultists maintain that all the \"Forces\" of the Scientists have their origin in the VitalPrinciple, the ONE LIFE collectively of our Solar system -- that \"life\" being a portion, or rather one of the aspects of the One UniversalLIFE.We may, therefore, as in the article under consideration, wherein, on the authority of the Adepts, it was maintained that it is \"sufficientto make a resume of what the solar physicists do not know,\" -- we may, we maintain, define our position with regard to the modernnebular theory and its evident incorrectness, by simply pointing out facts diametrically opposed to it in its present form. And to beginwith, what does it teach?Summarizing the aforesaid hypotheses, it becomes plain that Laplace's theory -- now made quite unrecognisable, moreover -- was anunfortunate one. He postulates in the first place Cosmic matter, existing in a state of diffuse nebulosity \"so fine that its presence couldhardly have been suspected.\" No attempt is made by him to penetrate into the arcana of being, except as regards the immediateevolution of our small solar system.Consequently, whether one accepts or rejects his theory in its bearing upon the immediate cosmological problems presented forsolution, he can only be said to have thrown back the mystery a little further. To the eternal query -- \"Whence matter itself; whence theevolutionary impetus"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 592 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.determining its cyclic aggregations and dissolutions; whence the exquisite symmetry and order into which the primeval atoms arrangeand group themselves?\" -- no answer is attempted by Laplace. All we are confronted with, is a sketch of the probable broad principleson which the actual process is assumed to be based. Well, and what is this now celebrated note on the said process? What has hegiven so wonderfully new and original, that its ground-work, at any rate, should have served as a basis for the modern nebular theory?This is what one gathers from various astronomical works.Laplace thought that, consequent on the condensation of the atoms of the primeval nebula, according to the \"Law\" of gravity, thenow gaseous, or perhaps, partially liquid mass, acquired a rotatory motion. As the velocity of this rotation increased, it assumed theform of a thin disc; finally, the centrifugal force overpowering that of cohesion, huge rings were detached from the edge of thewhirling incandescent masses, contracting necessarily by gravitation (as accepted) into spheroidal bodies, which would necessarily stillcontinue to preserve the same orbit occupied previously by the outer zone from which they were separated. (\"Laplace conceived thatthe external and internal zones of the ring would rotate with the same angular velocity, which would be the case with a solid ring; butthe principle of equal areas requires the inner zones to rotate more rapidly than the outer.\")* The velocity of the outer edge of eachnascent planet, he said, exceeding that of the inner, there results a rotation on its axis. The more dense bodies would be thrown offlast; and finally, during the preliminary state of their formation, the newly-segregated orbs in their turn throw off one or more satellites. . . In formulating the history of the rupture and planetation of rings, Laplace says:\"Almost always each ring of vapours must have broken up into numerous masses, which, moving with a nearly uniform velocity, musthave continued to circulate at the same distance around the Sun. These masses must have taken a spheroidal form with a motion ofrotation in the same direction as their revolution, since the inner molecules (those nearer to the Sun) would have less actual velocitythan the exterior ones. They must then have formed as many planets in a state of vapour. But, if one of them was sufficiently powerfulto unite successively, by its attraction, all the others around its centre, the ring of vapours must have been thus transformed into asingle spheroidal mass of vapours circulating around the Sun with a rotation in the same direction as its revolution. The latter casehas been the more common, but the solar system presents us the first case, in the four small planets which move between Jupiter andMars.\"While few will be found to deny \"the magnificent audacity of this[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"World-Life.\" Prof. Winchell points to a good many mistakes of Laplace in his work; but as a geologist he is not infallible himself inhis \"astronomical speculations.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 593 UNANSWERABLE QUERIES.hypothesis,\" it is impossible not to recognise the insurmountable difficulties with which it is attended. Why, for instance, do we findthat the satellites of Neptune and Uranus display a retrograde motion; that, in spite of its closer proximity to the Sun, Venus is lessdense than the Earth? Similarly, the more distant Uranus is more dense than Saturn? How is it that so many variations in theinclination of their axes and orbits are present in the supposed progeny of the central orb; that such startling variations in the size ofthe planets is noticeable; that the Satellites of Jupiter are more dense by .288 than their primary -- that the phenomena of meteoricand cometic systems still remain unaccounted for? To quote the words of a Master: \"They (the Occultists) find that the centrifugaltheory of Western birth is unable to cover all the ground. That, unaided, it can neither account for every oblate spheroid, nor explainaway such evident difficulties as are presented by the relative density of some planets. How, indeed, can any calculation ofcentrifugal force explain to us, for instance, why Mercury, whose rotation is, we are told, only about one-third that of the Earth, and itsdensity only about one-fourth greater than the Earth, should have a polar compression more than ten times as great as the latter? Andagain, why Jupiter, whose equatorial rotation is said to be 'twenty-seven times greater, and its density only about one-fifth that of theearth' should have its polar compression seventeen times greater than that of the earth? Or why Saturn, with an equatorial velocityfifty-five times greater than Mercury for centripetal force to contend with, should have its polar compression only three times greaterthan Mercury's? To crown the above contradictions, we are asked to believe in the Central Forces, as taught by Modern Science, evenwhen told that the equatorial matter of the Sun, with more than four times the centrifugal velocity of the Earth's equatorial surface,and only about one-fourth part of the gravitation of the equatorial matter, has not manifested any tendency to bulge at the Solarequator, nor shown the least flattening of the poles of the Solar axis. In other and clearer words, the Sun, with only one fourth of ourEarth's density for the centrifugal force to work upon, has no polar compression at all! We find this objection made by more than oneastronomer, yet never explained away satisfactorily so far as the 'Adepts' are aware.\"\"Therefore, do they (the Adepts) say, that the great men of science of the West, knowing . . . . . next to nothing either about cometarymatter, centrifugal and centripetal forces, the nature of the nebulae, or the physical constitution of the Sun, the Stars, or even theMoon, are imprudent to speak as confidently as they do about the 'central mass of the Sun' whirling out into space planets, comets,and what not . . . .\" \"We maintain that it (the Sun) evolves out only the life-principle, the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 594 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Soul of those bodies, giving and receiving it back, in our solar system, as the 'Universal Life-Giver' . . . . in infinitude and Eternity; thatthe solar system is as much the microcosm of the ONE Macrocosm as man is the former when compared with his own little SolarCosmos.\"*The essential faculty possessed by all the cosmic and terrestrial elements, of generating within themselves a regular and harmoniousseries of results, a concatenation of causes and effects, is an irrefutable proof that they are either animated by an extra or intraINTELLIGENCE, or conceal such within or behind the manifested veil. Occultism does not deny the certainty of the mechanical originof the Universe; it only claims the absolute necessity of mechanicians of some sort behind those Elements (or within) -- a dogma withus. It is not the fortuitous assistance of the atoms of Lucretius, who himself knew better, that built the Kosmos and all in it. Natureherself contradicts such a theory. Celestial space, containing matter so attenuated as is Ether, cannot be called on, with or withoutattraction, to explain the common motion of the sidereal hosts. Although the perfect accord of their mutual revolution indicatesclearly the presence of a mechanical cause in Nature, Newton, who of all men had best right to trust to his deductions and views, wasnevertheless forced to abandon the idea of ever explaining, by the laws of known Nature and its Material forces, the original impulsegiven to the millions of orbs. He recognised fully the limits that separate the action of natural Forces from that of the INTELLIGENCESthat set the immutable laws into order and action. And if a NEWTON had to renounce such hope, which of the modern materialisticpigmies has the right of saying: \"I know better\"?To become complete and comprehensible, a cosmogonical theory has to start with a primordial Substance diffused throughoutboundless Space, of an intellectual and divine Nature. That substance must be the Soul and Spirit, the Synthesis and SeventhPrinciple of the manifested Kosmos, and, to serve as a spiritual Upadhi to this, there must be the sixth, its vehicle -- primordialphysical matter, so to speak, though its nature must escape for ever our limited normal senses. It is easy for an astronomer, if endowedwith an imaginative faculty, to build a theory of the emergence of the universe out of chaos, by simply applying to it the principles ofmechanics. But such a universe will always prove, with respect to its scientific human creator, a Frankenstein's monster; it will lead himinto endless perplexities. The application of the mechanical laws only can never carry the speculator beyond the objective world; norwill it unveil to men the origin and final destiny of Kosmos. This is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" pp. 249-50. Art. \"Do the Adepts deny the Nebular Theory?\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 595 WHAT ARE THE NEBULAE?whither the nebular theory has led Science. In sober fact and truth this theory is twin sister to that of Ether, and both are the offspringsof necessity; one as indispensable to account for the transmission of light, as the other to explain the problem of the origin of the solarsystems. The question with them is, how the same homogeneous matter* could, obeying the laws of Newton, give birth to bodies --sun, planets, and their satellites -- subject to conditions of identity of motion and formed of such heterogeneous elements.Has the nebular theory helped to solve the problem, even if applied solely to bodies considered as inanimate and material? We saymost decidedly not. What progress has it made since 1811, when Sir W. Herschell's paper, first presenting facts based on observationand showing the existence of nebular matter, made the \"Sons\" of the Royal Society \"shout for joy\"? Since then a still greaterdiscovery has permitted, through spectrum analysis, the verification and corroboration of Sir W. Herschell's conjecture. Laplacedemanded some kind of primitive \"world stuff \" to prove the idea of progressive world-evolution and growth. Here it is, as offered twomillenniums ago.The \"world stuff,\" now nebulae, was known from the highest antiquity. Anaxagoras taught that, having differentiated, the subsequentcommixture of heterogeneous substances remained motionless and unorganized, until finally \"the Mind\" -- the collective body ofDhyan Chohans, we say -- began to work upon and communicated to it motion and order (Aristotle's \"Physica,\" viii, 1.) The theory isnow taken up in its first portion, that of any \"Mind\" interfering with it being rejected. Spectrum analysis reveals the existence ofnebulae formed entirely of gases and luminous vapours. Is this the primitive nebular matter? The spectra reveal, it is said, thephysical conditions of the matter which emits cosmic light. The spectra of the resolvable and the irresolvable nebulae are shown to beentirely different, the spectra of the latter showing their physical state to be that of glowing gas or vapour. The bright lines of onenebula reveal the existence of hydrogen in it, and of other material substances known and unknown. The same in the atmospheres ofthe Sun and stars. This leads to the direct inference that a star is formed by the condensation of a nebula; hence that even the metalsthemselves on earth are[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Had astronomers held simply, in their present state of knowledge, to the hypothesis of Laplace, which was simply the formation ofthe planetary system, it might in time have resulted in something like an approximate truth. But the two parts of the general problem,that of the formation of the universe, or the formation of the suns and stars from the primitive matter, and then the development of theplanets around their sun, rest on quite different facts in nature and are even so viewed by Science itself. They are at the oppositepoles of being.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 596 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"formed owing to the condensation of hydrogen or some other primitive matter, some ancestral cousin to \"helium,\" perhaps, or someyet unknown stuff? This does not clash with the occult teachings. And this is the problem that chemistry is trying to solve; and it mustsucceed sooner or later in the task, accepting nolens volens, when it does, the esoteric teaching. But when this does happen, it will killthe nebular theory as it now stands.Meanwhile Astronomy cannot accept in any way, if it is to be regarded as an exact science, the present theory of the filiation of stars --even if occultism does so in its own way, as it explains this filiation differently -- because astronomy has not one single physical datumto show for it. Astronomy could anticipate Chemistry in proving the existence of the fact, if it could show a planetary nebula exhibitinga spectrum of three or four bright lines, gradually condensing and transforming into a star, with a spectrum all covered with a numberof dark lines. But \"the question of the variability of the nebula, even as to their form, is yet one of the mysteries of Astronomy. Thedata of observation possessed so far are of too recent an origin, too uncertain to permit us to affirm anything.\" (CosmogonicalHypotheses of Wolf.)Since the discovery of the spectroscope, its magic power has revealed to its adepts only one single transformation of a star of this kind;and even that one showed directly the reverse of what is needed as proof in favour of the nebular theory; namely -- a star transformingitself into a planetary nebula. As told in The Observatory (Vol. I., p. 185), the temporary star which appeared in the constellationCygnus, in November, 1876, discovered by J. F. J. Schmidt, exhibited a spectrum broken by very brilliant lines. Gradually, thecontinuous spectrum and most of the lines disappeared, leaving finally one single brilliant line, which appeared to coincide with thegreen line of the nebula.Though this metamorphosis is not irreconcileable with the hypothesis of the nebular origin of the stars, nevertheless this single solitarycase rests on no observation whatever, least of all on direct observation. The occurrence may have been due to several other causes.Since astronomers are inclined to think our planets are tending toward precipitation on the Sun, why should not that star have blazedout owing to a collision of such precipitated planets, or, as many suggest, the appulse of a comet? Anyhow, the only known instanceof a star transformation since 1811 is not favourable to the nebular theory. Moreover, on the question of this theory, as in all others,astronomers disagree.In our own age, it was Buffon, before Laplace ever thought of it, who, very much struck by the identity of motion in the planets, wasthe first to propose the hypothesis of the planets and their satellites originating in------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 597 THE META-ELEMENTS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE.the bosom of the Sun. Forthwith, and for the purpose, he invented a special comet, supposed to have torn out, by a powerful obliqueblow, the quantity of matter necessary to their formation. Laplace gave its dues to the \"comet\" in his \"Exposition du Systeme duMonde.\" (Note VII.) But the idea was seized and even improved upon by a conception of the alternate evolution from the Sun'scentral mass of planets apparently without weight or influence on the motion of the visible planets -- and as evidently without anymore existence than the likeness of Moses in the moon.But the modern theory is also a variation on the systems elaborated by Kant and Laplace. The idea of both was that, at the origin ofthings, all that matter which now enters into the composition of the planetary bodies was spread over all the space comprised in thesolar system -- and even beyond. It was a nebula of extremely small density, whose condensation gradually gave birth, by amechanism that has hitherto never been explained, to the various bodies of our systems. This is the original nebular theory, anincomplete yet faithful repetition -- a short chapter out of the large volume of universal esoteric cosmogony -- of the teachings in theSecret Doctrine. And both systems, Kant's and Laplace's, differ greatly from the modern theory, redundant with conflicting sub-theoriesand fanciful hypotheses.\"The essence of cometary matter and of that which composes the stars is totally different from any of the chemical or physicalcharacteristics with which Western Science is now acquainted. While the spectroscope has shown the probable similarity (owing to thechemical action of terrestrial light upon the intercepted rays) of earthly and sidereal substance, the chemical actions, peculiar to thevariously progressed orbs of space, have not been detected, nor proven to be identical with those observed on our own planet\" -- saythe Teachers (op. cit.). Mr. Crookes says almost the same in the fragment quoted from his lecture, \"Elements and Meta-Elements.\"\"At the utmost,\" observes C. Wolf,* \"could the nebular hypothesis show in its favour, with W. Herschell, the existence of planetarynebulae in various degrees of condensation, and of spiral nebulae, with nuclei of condensation on the branches and centre.** But, infact, the knowledge of the bond that unites the nebulae to the stars is yet denied to us; and lacking as we do direct observation, weare even debarred from establishing it even on the analogy of chemical composition.\"It is evident that, even if the men of science, leaving aside the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Member of the Institute, Astronomer of the Observatory, Paris, \"Cosmogonical Hypotheses.\"** But the spectra of these nebulae have never yet been ascertained.

Unless they admit also that our actualvisible Universe is merely the Sthula-Sharira, the gross body, of the sevenfold Kosmos, they will have to face another problem;especially if they risk maintaining that its now visible bodies are the result of the condensation of that one and single primordialmatter. For mere observation shows them that the actions which produced the actual Universe are far more complex than could everbe embraced in that theory.First of all, there are two distinct classes of irresolvable nebulae, -- as Science itself teaches.The telescope is unable to distinguish between the two, but the spectroscope can, and notices, therefore, an essential differencebetween their physical constitutions.**\"Some of these,\" Wolf tells us, \"have a spectrum of three or four bright lines, others a continuous spectrum. The first are gaseous, theothers formed of a pulverulent matter. The former must constitute a veritable atmosphere: it is among these that the solar nebula ofLaplace has to be placed. The latter form an ensemble of particles that may be considered as independent, and the rotation of whichobeys the laws of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Mr. Crookes' \"Protyle\" must not be regarded as the primary stuff, out of which the Dhyan Chohans, in accordance with the immutablelaws of nature, wove our solar system. This protyle cannot even be the first prima-materia of Kant, which that great mind saw used upin the formation of the worlds, and thus existing no longer in a diffused state. It is a MEDIATE phase in the progressive differentiationof cosmic substance from its normal undifferentiated state. Protyle is then the aspect assumed by matter in its middle passage into fullobjectivity.** \"The question of the resolvability of the nebulae has been often presented in too affirmative a manner and quite contrary to theideas expressed by the illustrious experimenter with the spectra of these constellations -- Mr. Huggins. Every nebula whose spectrumcontains only bright lines is gaseous, it is said, and hence is irresolvable; every nebula with a continuous spectrum must end byresolving into stars with an instrument of sufficient power. This assumption is contrary at once to the results obtained, and tospectroscopic theory. The Lyra nebula, the Dumb-bell nebula, the central region of the nebula of Orion, appear resolvable, and showa spectrum of bright lines; the nebula of Canis Venatici is not resolvable, and gives a continuous spectrum. Because, indeed, thespectroscope informs us of the physical state of the constituent matter of the stars, but affords us no notions of their modes ofaggregation. A nebula formed of gaseous globes (or even of nuclei, faintly luminous, surrounded by a powerful atmosphere) wouldgive a spectrum of lines and be still resolvable; such seems to be the state of Huggins' region in the Orion nebula. A nebula formed ofsolid or fluidic particles in a state of incandescence, a true cloud, will give a continuous spectrum but will be irresolvable.\" (C. Wolf,Cosmogonical Hypotheses.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 599 THE NEBULAR THEORY A ROMANCE.internal weight: such are the nebulae adopted by Kant and Faye. Observation allows us to place the one as the other at the veryorigin of the planetary world. But when we try to go beyond and ascend to the primitive chaos which has produced the totality of theheavenly bodies, we have first to account for the actual existence of these two classes of nebulae. If the primitive chaos were a coldluminous gas,* one could understand how the contraction resulting from attraction could have heated it and made it luminous. Wehave to explain the condensation of this gas to the state of incandescent particles, the presence of which is revealed to us in certainnebulae by the spectroscope. If the original chaos was composed of such particles, how did certain of their portions pass into thegaseous state, while others have preserved their primitive condition? . . . .\"Such is the synopsis of the objections and difficulties to the acceptance of the nebular theory brought forward by the French savant,who concludes his interesting chapter by declaring that:--\"The first part of the Cosmogonical problem, -- what is the primitive matter of chaos; and how did that matter give birth to the sun andstars? -- thus remains to this day in THE DOMAIN OF ROMANCE AND OF MERE IMAGINATION.\"**If this is the last word of Science upon that subject, whither then should one turn in order to learn what the nebular theory is supposedto teach? What, in fact, is this theory? What it is, no one seems to know for a certainty. What it is not -- we learn from the eruditeauthor of the \"World-Life.\" He tells us that:--(I.) It \"is not a theory of the evolution of the Universe . . . but only and primarily a genetic explanation of the phenomena of the solarsystem, and accessorily a co-ordination of the principal phenomena in the stellar and nebular firmament, as far as human vision hasbeen able to penetrate.\"(II.) \"That it does not regard the Comets as involved in that particular evolution which has produced the solar system.\" (Esotericdoctrine does.)"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"(It does, because it, too, recognises the comets as forms of cosmic existence co-ordinated with earlier stages of nebular evolution; andit actually assigns to them chiefly the formation of all worlds.)(III.) \"That it does not deny an antecedent history of the luminous fire mist\" -- (the secondary stage of evolution in the Secret Doctrine). . . . \"and makes no claim to having reached an absolute beginning.\" And even[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Stanza III. about \"Light, or the cold Flame,\" and Commentary Number 8, where it is explained that the \"mother\" (Chaos) is acold Fire, a cool Radiance, colourless, formless, devoid of every quality. \"Motion is the One Eternal is, and contains the potentialitiesof every quality in the Manvantaric Worlds,\" it is said.** Hypotheses Cosmogoniques, C.

Even the greatest philosopher of England -- Mr. Herbert Spencer -- arrayed himself against the fantastic theory bysaying that (a) \"The problem of existence is not resolved\" by it; (b) the nebular hypothesis \"throws no light upon the origin of diffusedmatter,\" and (c) that \"the nebular hypothesis (as it now stands) implies a First Cause.\"**The latter, we are afraid, is more than our modern physicists have bargained for. Thus, it seems that the poor \"hypothesis\" can hardlyexpect to find help or corroboration even in the world of the metaphysicians.Considering all this, the Occultists believe they have a right to present their philosophy, however misunderstood and ostracised it maybe at present. And they maintain that this failure of the scientists to discover the truth is entirely due to their materialism and contemptfor transcendental sciences. Yet although the scientific minds in our century are as far from the true and correct doctrine of Evolutionas ever, there may be still some hope left for the future, as we find another great scientist giving us a faint glimmer of it.In an article in Popular Science Review (Vol. XIV., p. 252) on \"Recent Researches in Minute Life,\" we find Mr. H. J. Slack, F.C.S.,Sec. R.M.S., saying: \"There is an evident convergence of all sciences, from physics to chemistry and physiology, toward some doctrineof evolution and development, of which the facts of Darwinism will form part, but what ultimate aspect this doctrine will take, there islittle, if any, evidence to show, and perhaps it will not be shaped by the human mind until metaphysical as well as physical inquiriesare much more advanced.\"This is a happy forecast indeed. The day may come, then, when the \"Natural Selection,\" as taught by Mr. Darwin and Mr. HerbertSpencer, will form only a part, in its ultimate modification, of our Eastern doctrine of Evolution, which will be Manu and Kapilaesoterically explained.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"World-Life,\" p. 196.** Westminster Review, XX., July 27, 1868.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 601 HERMES AND KANT.XIV.FORCES -- MODES OF MOTION OR INTELLIGENCES?THIS is, then, the last word of physical science up to the present year, 1888. Mechanical laws will never be able to prove thehomogeneity of primeval matter, except inferentially and as a desperate necessity, when there will remain no other issue -- as in thecase of Ether. Modern Science is secure only in its own domain and region; within the physical boundaries of our solar system,beyond which everything, every particle of matter, is different from the matter it knows: which matter exists in states of which Sciencecan form no idea. That matter, which is truly homogeneous, is beyond human perceptions, if perception is tied down merely to thefive senses. We feel its effects through those INTELLIGENCES which are the results of its primeval differentiation, whom we nameDhyan-Chohans; called in the Hermetic works the \"Seven Governors,\" those to whom Pymander, the \"Thought Divine,\" refers as theBuilding Powers, and whom Asklepios calls the \"Supernal Gods.\" That matter -- the real primordial substance, the noumenon of allthe \"matter\" we know of, -- even some of the astronomers have been led to believe in, and to despair of the possibility of everaccounting for rotation, gravitation, and the origin of any mechanical physical laws -- unless these Intelligences be admitted byScience. In the abovequoted work upon astronomy, by Wolf,* the author endorses fully the theory of Kant, and the latter, if not in itsgeneral aspect, at any rate in some of its features, reminds one strongly of certain esoteric teachings.

Itfills a gap which Newton, with all his genius, failed to bridge. And surely it is our primeval matter, Akasa, that Kant had in view, whenproposing to solve Newton's difficulty and his failure to explain, by the natural forces, the primitive impulse imparted to the planets, bythe postulation of a universally pervading primordial substance.

A very slight alteration of words is needed,and a few additions, to make of this our Esoteric Doctrine.The latter teaches that it is this original, primordial prima materia, divine and intelligent, the direct emanation of the Universal Mind -- the Daiviprakriti (the divine light emanating from the Logos*) -- which formed the nuclei of all the \"self-moving\" orbs in Kosmos. It isthe informing, ever-present moving-power and life-principle, the vital soul of the suns, moons, planets, and even of our Earth. Theformer latent: the last one active -- the invisible Ruler and guide of the gross body attached to, and connected with, its Soul, which isthe spiritual emanation, after all, of these respective planetary Spirits.Another quite occult doctrine is the theory of Kant, that the matter of which the inhabitants and the animals of other planets areformed is of a lighter and more subtle nature and of a more perfect conformation in proportion to their distance from the Sun. Thelatter is too full of Vital Electricity, of the physical, life-giving principle. Therefore, the men on Mars are more ethereal than we are,while those of Venus are more gross, though far more intelligent, if less spiritual.The last doctrine is not quite ours -- yet those Kantian theories are as metaphysical, and as transcendental as any occult doctrines;and more than one man of Science would, if he but dared speak his mind, accept them as Wolf does. From this Kantian mind andsoul of the Suns and Stars to the MAHAT (mind) and Prakriti of the Puranas, there is but a step. After all, the admission of this byScience would be only the admission of a natural cause, whether it would or would not stretch its belief to such metaphysical heights.But then Mahat, the MIND, is a \"God,\" and physiology admits \"mind\" only as a temporary function of the material brain, and no more.The Satan of Materialism now laughs at all alike, and denies the visible as well as the invisible. Seeing in light, heat, electricity, andeven in the phenomenon of life, only properties inherent in matter, it[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Which \"Light\" we call Fohat.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 603 THE VITAL PRINCIPLE.laughs whenever life is called VITAL PRINCIPLE, and derides the idea of its being independent of and distinct from the organism.But here again scientific opinions differ as in everything else, and there are several men of science who accept views very similar toours. Consider, for instance, what Dr. Richardson, F.R.S. (elsewhere quoted at length) says of that \"Vital principle,\" which he calls\"nervous ether\" (\"Popular Science Review,\" Vol. 10):--\"I speak only of a veritable material agent, refined, it may be, to the world at large, but actual and substantial: an agent havingquality of weight and of volume, an agent susceptible of chemical combination, and thereby of change of physical state andcondition, an agent passive in its action, moved always, that is to say, by influences apart from itself,* obeying other influences, anagent possessing no initiative power, no vis or energia naturae,** but still playing a most important, if not a primary part in theproduction of the phenomena resulting from the action of the energeia upon visible matter\" (p. 379).As Biology and Physiology now deny, in toto, the existence of a \"vital principle,\" this extract, together with de Quatrefages' admission,is a clear confirmation that there are men of science who take the same views about \"things occult\" as theosophists and occultists do.These recognise a distinct vital principle independent of the organism -- material, of course, as physical force cannot be divorced frommatter, but of a substance existing in a state unknown to Science. Life for them is something more than the mere interaction of"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"molecules and atoms. There is a vital principle without which no molecular combinations could ever have resulted in a livingorganism, least of all in the so-called \"inorganic\" matter of our plane of consciousness.By \"molecular combinations\" is meant, of course, those of the matter of our present illusive perceptions, which matter energises onlyon this, our plane. And this is the chief point at issue.***[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This is a mistake, which implies a material agent, distinct from the influences which move it, i.e. blind matter and perhaps \"God\"again, whereas this ONE Life is the very God and Gods \"Itself.\"** The same error.*** \"Is the Jiva a myth, as science says, or is it not?\" ask some Theosophists, wavering between materialistic and idealistic Science.The difficulty of really grasping esoteric problems concerning the \"ultimate state of matter\" is again the old crux of the objective andthe subjective. What is matter? Is the matter of our present objective consciousness anything but our SENSATIONS? True, thesensations we receive come from without, but can we really (except in terms of phenomena) speak of the \"gross matter\" of this planeas an entity apart from and independent of us? To all such arguments Occultism answers: True, in reality matter is not independentof, or existent outside, our perceptions. Man is an illusion: granted. But the existence and actuality of other, still more illusive, but notless actual, entities than we are, is not a claim which is lessened, but rather strengthened by this doctrine of Vedantic and evenKantian Idealism.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 604 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Thus the Occultists are not alone in their beliefs. Nor are they so foolish, after all, in rejecting even the \"gravity\" of modern Sciencealong with other physical laws, and in accepting instead attraction and repulsion. They see, moreover, in these two opposite Forcesonly the two aspects of the universal unit, called \"MANIFESTING MIND\"; in which aspects, Occultism, through its great Seers,perceives an innumerable Host of operative Beings: Cosmic Dhyan-Chohans, Entities, whose essence, in its dual nature, is the Causeof all terrestrial phenomena. For that essence is co-substantial with the universal Electric Ocean, which is LIFE; and being dual, assaid -- positive and negative -- it is the emanations of that duality that act now on earth under the name of \"modes of motion\"; evenForce having now become objectionable as a word, for fear it should lead someone, even in thought, to separate it from matter! It is,as Occultism says, the dual effects of that dual essence, which have now been called centripetal and centrifugal forces, negative andpositive poles, or polarity, heat and cold, light and darkness, etc., etc.And it is maintained that even the Greek and Roman Catholic Christians, are wiser in believing, as they do -- even if blindlyconnecting and tracing them all to an anthropomorphic god -- in Angels, Archangels, Archons, Seraphs, and Morning Stars: in allthose theological Deliciae humani generis, in short, that rule the cosmic elements, than Science is, in disbelieving in themaltogether, and advocating its mechanical Forces. For these act very often with more than human intelligence and pertinency.Nevertheless, that intelligence is denied and attributed to blind chance. But, as De Maistre was right in calling the law of gravitationmerely a word which replaced \"the thing unknown\" (Soirees), so are we right in applying the same remark to all the other Forces ofScience. And if it is objected that the Count was an ardent Roman Catholic, then we may cite Le Couturier, as ardent a materialist,who said the same thing, as also did Herschell and many others. (Vide Musee des Sciences, August, 1856.)From Gods to men, from Worlds to atoms, from a star to a rush-light, from the Sun to the vital heat of the meanest organic being -- theworld of Form and Existence is an immense chain, whose links are all connected. The law of Analogy is the first key to the world-problem, and these links have to be studied coordinately in their occult relations to each other.When, therefore, the Secret Doctrine -- postulating that conditioned or limited space (location) has no real being except in this worldof illusion, or, in other words, in our perceptive faculties -- teaches that every one of the higher, as of the lower worlds, is interblendedwith our own objective world; that millions of things and beings are, in point of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 605 OCCULT AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES.localization, around and in us, as we are around, with, and in them; it is no metaphysical figure of speech, but a sober fact in Nature,however incomprehensible to our senses.But one has to understand the phraseology of Occultism before criticising what it asserts. For example, the Doctrine refuses (asScience does, in one sense) to use the words \"above\" and \"below,\" \"higher\" and \"lower,\" in reference to invisible spheres, as beingwithout meaning. Even the terms \"East\" and \"West\" are merely conventional, necessary only to aid our human perceptions. For,though the Earth has its two fixed points in the poles, North and South, yet both East and West are variable relatively to our ownposition on the Earth's surface, and in consequence of its rotation from West to East. Hence, when \" other worlds\" are mentioned --whether better or worse, more spiritual or still more material, though both invisible -- the Occultist does not locate these spheres eitheroutside or inside our Earth, as the theologians and the poets do; for their location is nowhere in the space known to, and conceivedby, the profane. They are, as it were, blended with our world interpenetrating it and interpenetrated by it. There are millions andmillions of worlds and firmaments visible to us; there still greater numbers beyond those visible to the telescopes, and many of thelatter kind do not belong to our objective sphere of existence. Although as invisible as if they were millions of miles beyond our solar"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"system, they are yet with us, near us, within our own world, as objective and material to their respective inhabitants as ours is to us.But, again, the relation of these worlds to ours is not that of a series of egg-shaped boxes enclosed one within the other, like the toyscalled Chinese nests; each is entirely under its own special laws and conditions, having no direct relation to our sphere. Theinhabitants of these, as already said, may be, for all we know, or feel, passing through and around us as if through empty space, theirvery habitations and countries being interblended with ours, though not disturbing our vision, because we have not yet the facultiesnecessary for discerning them. Yet by their spiritual sight the Adepts, and even some seers and sensitives, are always able to discern,whether in a greater or smaller degree, the presence and close proximity to us of Beings pertaining to other spheres of life.

Thus, while Sciencesternly rejects even the possibility of there being such (to us, generally) invisible creatures, Society, while believing in it all secretly, ismade to deride the idea openly. It hails with mirth such works as the Count de Gabalis, and fails to understand that open satire is thesecurest mask.Nevertheless, such invisible worlds do exist. Inhabited as thickly as our own is, they are scattered throughout apparent Space inimmense number; some far more material than our own world, others gradually etherealizing until they become formless and are as\"Breaths.\" That our physical eye does not see them, is no reason to disbelieve in them; physicists can see neither their ether, atoms,nor \"modes of motion,\" or Forces. Yet they accept and teach them.If we find, even in the natural world with which we are acquainted, matter affording a partial analogy in the difficult conception ofsuch invisible worlds, there seems little difficulty in recognizing the possibility of such a presence. The tail of a comet, which, thoughattracting our attention by virtue of its luminosity, yet does not disturb or impede our vision of objects, which we perceive through andbeyond it, affords the first stepping-stone toward a proof of the same. The tail of a comet passes rapidly across our horizon, and weshould neither feel it, nor be cognizant of its passage, but for the brilliant coruscation, often perceived only by a few interested in thephenomenon, while everyone else remains ignorant of its presence and passage through, or across, a portion of our globe.

Indeed, it is no question of superstition, but simply a result of transcendental science, and oflogic still more, to admit the existence of worlds formed of even far more attenuated matter than the tail of a comet. By denying sucha possibility, Science has played for the last century into the hands of neither philosophy nor true religion, but simply into those oftheology. To be able to dispute the better the plurality of even material worlds, a belief thought by many churchmen incompatiblewith the teachings and doctrines of the Bible,* Maxwell had to calumniate the memory of Newton, and try to convince his public thatthe principles contained in the Newtonian philosophy are those \"which lie at the foundation of all atheistical systems.\" (Vide Vol. II.,\"Plurality of Worlds.\")\"Dr. Whewell disputed the plurality of worlds by appeal to scientific evidence,\" writes Professor Winchell.** And if even the habitabilityof physical worlds, of planets, and distant stars which shine in myriads over our heads is so disputed, how little chance is there for theacceptance of invisible worlds within the apparently transparent space of our own!But, if we can conceive of a world composed (for our senses) of matter still more attenuated than the tail of a comet, hence ofinhabitants in it who are as ethereal, in proportion to their globe, as we are in comparison with our rocky, hard-crusted earth, nowonder if we do not perceive them, nor sense their presence or even existence.

If these microbes, bacteria and thetutti quanti of the infinitesimally small, are invisible to us by virtue of their minuteness, cannot there be, at the other pole of it, beingsas invisible owing to the quality of their texture or matter -- to its tenuity, in fact? Conversely, as to the effects of cometary matter, havewe not another example of a half visible form of life and matter? The ray of sunlight entering our apartment, reveals in its passagemyriads of tiny beings living their little life and ceasing to be, independent and heedless of whether they are perceived or not by ourgrosser materiality. And so again, of the microbes and bacteria and such-like unseen beings in other elements. We passed them by,during those long centuries of dreary ignorance, after the lamp of knowledge in the heathen and highly philosophical systems hadceased to throw its bright light on the ages of intolerance and bigotry during early Christianity; and we would fain pass them by againnow.And yet these lives surrounded us then as they do now. They have worked on, obedient to their own laws, and it is only as they weregradually revealed by Science that we have begun to take cognisance of them, as of the effects produced by them.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] biped is something not depending on the necessities of organization, or instinct, orintelligence. That an animal should possess just five senses is not a necessity of percipient existence. There may be animals on theearth with neither smell nor taste. There may be beings on other worlds, and even on this, who possess more numerous senses thanwe. The possibility of this is apparent when we consider the high probability that other properties and other modes of existence lieamong the resources of the Kosmos, and even of terrestrial matter.

They might be lost in the abysses of the ocean,or laid up on a stormy cliff through the tempests of an Arctic winter, or plunged in a volcano for a hundred years, and yet retainconsciousness and thought. It is conceivable. Why might not psychic natures be enshrined in indestructible flint and platinum? Thesesubstances are no further from the nature of intelligence than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and lime. But, not to carry the thought tosuch an extreme (?), might not high intelligences be embodied in frames as indifferent to external conditions as the sage of thewestern plains, or the lichens of Labrador, the rotifers that remain dried for years, or the spores of bacteria which pass living throughboiling water. . . . These suggestions are made simply to remind the reader how little can be argued respecting the necessaryconditions of intelligent, organized existence, from the standard of corporeal existence found upon the earth.

It not only reconciles the various and apparently conflicting systems, but it checks thediscoveries of modern exact science, and shows some of them to be necessarily correct, since they are found corroborated in theancient records. All this will, no doubt, be regarded as terribly impertinent and disrespectful, a veritable crime of lese-Science;nevertheless, it is a fact.Science is, undeniably, ultra-materialistic in our days; but it finds, in one sense, its justification. Nature behaving in actu everesoterically, and being, as the Kabalists say, in abscondito, can only be judged by the profane through her appearance, and thatappearance is always deceitful on the physical plane. On the other hand, the naturalists refuse to blend physics with metaphysics, thebody with its informing soul and spirit, which they prefer ignoring. This is a matter of choice with some, while the minority strive verysensibly to enlarge the domain of physical science by trespassing on the forbidden grounds of metaphysics, so distasteful to somematerialists. These scientists are wise in their generation. For all their wonderful discoveries would go for nothing, and remain for everheadless bodies, unless they lift the veil of matter and strain their eyes to see beyond. Now that they have studied nature in thelength, breadth, and thickness of her physical frame, it is time to remove the skeleton to the second plane and search within theunknown depths for the living and real entity, for its SUB-stance -- the noumenon of evanescent matter.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The Septenary Principle,\" art. in \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" p. 197.** The Atman or Spirit (the Spiritual SELF) passing like a thread through the five subtle bodies (or principles, Koshas) is called\"thread-soul,\" or Sutratman in Vedantic philosophy.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 611 WHICH OF THE TWO IS BLIND?It is only by acting on such lines that some of the truths, now called \"exploded superstitions,\" will be discovered to be facts and therelics of ancient knowledge and wisdom.One of such \"degrading\" beliefs -- in the opinion of the all-denying sceptic -- is found in the idea that Kosmos, besides its objectiveplanetary inhabitants, its humanities in other inhabited worlds, is full of invisible, intelligent Existences. The so-called Arch-Angels,Angels and Spirits, of the West, copies of their prototypes, the Dhyan-Chohans, the Devas and Pitris, of the East, are no real Beingsbut fictions. On this point Materialistic Science is inexorable. To support its position, it upsets its own axiomatic law of uniformity inthe laws of nature, that of continuity, and all the logical sequence of analogies in the evolution of being. The masses of the profaneare asked, and made, to believe that the accumulated testimony of History, which shows even the Atheists of old -- such as Epicurusand Democritus -- believing in gods, was false; and that philosophers like Socrates and Plato, asserting their existence, were mistakenenthusiasts and fools. If we hold our opinions merely on historical grounds, on the authority of legions of the most eminent Sages,Neo-Platonists, Mystics of all the ages, from Pythagoras down to the eminent Scientists and Professors of the present century, who, ifthey reject \"gods,\" believe in \"spirits,\" shall we consider such authorities as weak-minded and foolish as any Roman Catholic peasant,who believes in and prays to his once human Saint, or the Archangel, St. Michael? But is there no difference between the belief of"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"the peasant and that of the Western heirs to the Rosicrucians and Alchemists of the Middle Ages?

The latter, weopine. It would be a miracle indeed, quite an abnormal fact in the realm of probabilities and logic, were that handful of negators tobe the sole custodians of truth, while the million-strong hosts of believers in gods, angels, and spirits -- in Europe and America alone --namely, Greek and Latin Christians, Theosophists, Spiritualists, Mystics, etc., etc., should be no better than deluded fanatics andhallucinated mediums, and often no higher than the victims of deceivers and impostors! However varying in their externalpresentations and dogmas, beliefs in the Hosts of invisible Intelligences of various grades have all the same foundation. Truth anderror are mixed in all. The exact extent, depth, breadth, and length of the mysteries of Nature are to be found only in Eastern esotericsciences. So vast and so profound are these that hardly a few, a very few of the highest Initiates -- those whose very existence is knownbut to a small number of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 612 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Adepts -- are capable of assimilating the knowledge. Yet it is all there, and one by one facts and processes in Nature's workshops arepermitted to find their way into the exact Sciences, while mysterious help is given to rare individuals in unravelling its arcana. It is atthe close of great Cycles, in connection with racial development, that such events generally take place. We are at the very close of thecycle of 5,000 years of the present Aryan Kaliyuga; and between this time and 1897 there will be a large rent made in the Veil ofNature, and materialistic science will receive a death-blow.Without throwing any discredit upon time-honoured beliefs, in whatever direction, we are forced to draw a marked line between blindfaith, evolved by theologies, and knowledge due to the independent researches of long generations of adepts; between, in short, faithand philosophy. There have been -- in all ages -- undeniably learned and good men who, having been reared in sectarian beliefs,died in their crystallized convictions. For Protestants, the garden of Eden is the primeval point of departure in the drama of Humanity,and the solemn tragedy on the summit of Calvary, the prelude to the hoped-for Millennium. For Roman Catholics, Satan is at thefoundation of Kosmos, Christ in its centre, and Antichrist at its apex. For both, the Hierarchy of Being begins and ends within thenarrow frames of their respective theologies: one self-created personal God and an Empyrean ringing with the Hallelujas of createdangels; the rest, false gods, Satan and fiends.Theophilosophy proceeds on broader lines. From the very beginning of AEons -- in time and space in our Round and Globe -- theMysteries of Nature (at any rate, those which it is lawful for our races to know) were recorded by the pupils of those same now invisible\"heavenly men,\" in geometrical figures and symbols. The keys thereto passed from one generation of \"wise men\" to the other. Someof the symbols, thus passed from the east to the west, were brought therefrom by Pythagoras, who was not the inventor of his famous\"Triangle.\" The latter figure, along with the plane cube and circle, are more eloquent and scientific descriptions of the order of theevolution of the Universe, spiritual and psychic, as well as physical, than volumes of descriptive Cosmogonies and revealed\"Geneses.\" The ten points inscribed within that \"Pythagorean triangle\" are worth all the theogonies and angelologies ever emanatedfrom the theological brain. For he who interprets them -- on their very face, and in the order given -- will find in these seventeen points(the seven Mathematical Points hidden) the uninterrupted series of the genealogies from the first Heavenly to terrestrial man. And, asthey give the order of Beings, so they reveal the order in which were evolved the Kosmos, our earth, and the primordial elements by------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 613 THE MATHEMATICAL POINT.which the latter was generated. Begotten in the invisible Depths, and in the womb of the same \"Mother\" as its fellow-globes -- he whowill master the mysteries of our Earth, will have mastered those of all others.Whatever ignorance, pride or fanaticism may suggest to the contrary, Esoteric Cosmology can be shown inseparably connected withboth philosophy and modern science. The gods of the ancients, the monads -- from Pythagoras down to Leibnitz -- and the atoms ofthe present materialistic schools (as borrowed by them from the theories of the old Greek Atomists) are only a compound unit, or agraduated unity like the human frame, which begins with body and ends with spirit. In the occult sciences they can be studiedseparately, but never mastered unless viewed in their mutual correlations during their life-cycle, and as a Universal Unity duringPralayas.La Pluche shows sincerity, but gives a poor idea of his philosophical capacities when declaring his personal views on the Monad orthe Mathematical Point. \"A point,\" he says, \"is enough to put all the schools in the world in a combustion. But what need has man toknow that point, since the creation of such a small being is beyond his power? A fortiori, philosophy acts against probability when,from that point which absorbs and disconcerts all her meditations, she presumes to pass on to the generation of the world. . . .\"Philosophy, however, could never have formed its conception of a logical, universal, and absolute Deity if it had no MathematicalPoint within the Circle to base its speculations upon. It is only the manifested Point, lost to our senses after its pregenetic appearancein the infinitude and incognizability of the Circle, that made a reconciliation between philosophy and theology possible -- oncondition that the latter should abandon its crude materialistic dogmas. And it is because it has so unwisely rejected the PythagoreanMonad and geometrical figures, that Christian theology has evolved its self-created human and personal God, the monstrous Headfrom whence flow in two streams the dogmas of Salvation and Damnation. This is so true that even those clergymen who would bephilosophers and who were masons, have, in their arbitrary interpretations, fathered upon the ancient sages the queer idea that \"theMonad represented (with them) the throne of the Omnipotent Deity, placed in the centre of the Empyrean to indicate T.G.A.O.T.U.\"* -- read \"the Great Architect of the Universe.\" A curious explanation this, more Masonic than strictly Pythagorean."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Nor did the \"hierogram within a Circle, or equilateral Triangle,\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Science of Numbers,\" by the Rev.

Those unable to seize the difference between the monad -- the UniversalUnit -- and the Monads or the manifested Unity, as also between the ever-hidden and the revealed LOGOS or the Word, ought neverto meddle in philosophy, let alone the Esoteric Sciences. It is needless to remind the educated reader of Kant's Thesis to demonstratehis second Antinomy.* Those who have read and understood it will see clearly the line we draw between the absolutely Ideal Universeand the invisible though manifested Kosmos. Our Gods and Monads are not the Elements of extension itself, but only those of theinvisible reality which is the basis of the manifested Kosmos. Neither esoteric philosophy, nor Kant, nor Leibnitz would ever admit thatextension can be composed of simple or unextended parts. But theologian-philosophers will not grasp this. The Circle and the Point,which latter retires into and merges with the former, after having emanated the first three points and connected them with lines, thusforming the first noumenal basis of the Second Triangle in the Manifested World, have ever been an insuperable obstacle totheological flights into dogmatic Empyreans. On the authority of this Archaic Symbol, a male, personal god, the Creator and Father ofall, becomes a third-rate emanation, the Sephiroth standing fourth in descent, and on the left hand of En-Soph (see the KabalisticTree of Life). Hence, the Monad is degraded into a Vehicle -- a \"throne\"!The Monad -- only the emanation and reflection of the Point (Logos) in the phenomenal World -- becomes, as the apex of themanifested equilateral triangle, the \"Father.\" The left side or line is the Duad, the \"Mother,\" regarded as the evil, counteractingprinciple (Plutarch, De Placitis Placitorum); the right side represents the Son (\"his Mother's husband\" in every Cosmogony, as one withthe apex); at the basic line is the Universal plane of productive Nature, unifying on the phenomenal plane Father-Mother-Son, asthese were unified in the apex, in the supersensuous World.** By mystic transmutation they became the Quaternary -- the trianglebecame the TETRAKTIS.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Kant's Critique de la Raison pure (Barni's transl., Vol. II., p. 54).** In the Greek and Latin churches -- which regard marriage as one of the sacraments -- the officiating priest during the marriageceremony represents the apex of the triangle; the bride its left feminine side and the bridegroom the right one, while the horizontalline is symbolised by the row of witness, the bridesmaids and best-men. But behind [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 615 SPACE, FORCE AND MATTER.This transcendental application of geometry to Cosmic and divine theogony -- the Alpha and the Omega of mystical conception --became dwarfed after Pythagoras by Aristotle. By omitting the Point and the Circle, and taking no account of the apex, he reducedthe metaphysical value of the idea, and thus limited the doctrine of magnitude to a simple TRIAD -- the line, the surface, and thebody. His modern heirs, who play at Idealism, have interpreted these three geometrical figures as Space, Force, and Matter -- \"thepotencies of an interacting Unity.\"* Materialistic Science, perceiving but the basic line of the manifested \"triangle\" -- the plane ofmatter -- translates it practically as (Father)-MATTER, (Mother)-MATTER, and (Son)-MATTER, and theoretically as Matter, Force, andCorrelation.But to the average physicist, as remarked by a Kabalist, \"Space, Force, Matter, are, what signs in algebra are to the mathematician,merely conventional symbols;\" or \"Force as force, and Matter as matter, are as absolutely unknowable as is the assumed empty spacein which they are held to interact.\" As symbols representing abstractions, \"the physicist bases reasoned hypotheses of the origin ofthings . . . . and sees three needs in what he terms creation: (a) a place wherein to create; (b) a medium by which to create; (c) amaterial from which to create. And in giving a logical expression to this hypothesis through the terms space, force, matter, he believeshe has proved the existence of that which each of these represents as he conceives it to be.\"**The physicist who regards Space merely as a representation of our mind, or extension unrelated to things in it, which Locke defined ascapable of neither resistance nor motion; the paradoxical materialist, who would have a void there, where he can see no matter,would reject with the utmost contempt the proposition that \"Space is a substantial though (apparently) an absolutely unknowableliving Entity.\" (New Aspects, p. 9.) Such is, nevertheless, the Kabalistic teaching, and it is that of Archaic philosophy. Space is the realworld, while our world is an artificial one. It is the One Unity throughout its infinitude: in its bottomless depths as on its illusive surface;a surface studded with countless phenomenal Universes, systems and mirage-like worlds. Nevertheless, to the Eastern Occultist, who isan objective Idealist at the bottom, in the real world, which is a Unity of Forces, there is \"a connection of all matter in the plenum,\" asLeibnitz would say.

The upper single dot is a Monad, and represents a Unit-Point, which is the Unity from whence allproceeds, and all is of the same essence with it. While the ten dots within the triangle represent the phenomenal world, the threesides of the equilateral triangle which enclose the pyramid of dots are the barriers of noumenal Matter, or Substance, that separate itfrom the world of Thought. \"Pythagoras considered a point to correspond in proportion to unity; a line to 2; a superficies to 3; a solidto 4; and he defined a point as a Monad having position, and the beginning of all things; a line was thought to correspond withduality, because it was produced by the first motion from indivisible nature, and formed the junction of two points. A superficies wascompared to the number three because it is the first of all causes that are found in figures; for a circle, which is the principal of allround figures, comprises a triad, in centre -- space -- circumference. But a triangle, which is the first of all rectilineal figures, isincluded in a ternary, and receives its form according to that number; and was considered by the Pythagoreans to be the creator of allsublunary things. The four points at the base of the Pythagorean triangle correspond with a solid or cube, which combines theprinciples of length, breadth, and thickness, for no solid can have less than four extreme boundary points.\" (Pythag. Triangle, p. 19.)It is argued that \"the human mind cannot conceive an indivisible unit short of the annihilation of the idea with its subject.\" This is anerror, as the Pythagoreans have proved, and a number of Seers before them, although there is a special training for it, and althoughthe profane mind can hardly grasp it. But there are such things as metamathematics and metageometry. Even mathematics pure andsimple proceed from the Universal to the particular, from the mathematical, hence indivisible Point, to solid figures. The teachingoriginated in India, and was taught in Europe by Pythagoras, who, throwing a veil over the Circle and the Point -- which no living mancan define except as incomprehensible abstractions -- laid the origin of the differentiated Cosmic matter in the basic or horizontal lineof the Triangle. Thus the latter became the earliest of geometrical figures. The author of \"New Aspects of Life\" and of the KabalisticMysteries -- objects to the objectivization, so to speak, of the Pythagorean conception and use of the equilateral triangle, and calls it amisnomer. His argument that a solid equilateral body -- \"one whose base, and each of its sides, form equal triangles -- must have fourco-equal sides or surfaces, while a triangular plane will as necessarily possess five,\" demonstrates on the contrary the grandeur of theconception in all its esoteric application to the idea of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 617 PHANTOMS OF THE MIND.the pregenesis, and the genesis of Kosmos. Granted, that an ideal triangle, depicted by mathematical, imaginary lines \"can have nosides at all, being simply a phantom of the mind (if sides be imputed to which, they must be the sides of the object it constructivelyrepresents).\" But in such case most of the scientific hypotheses are no better than \"phantoms of the mind\"; they are unverifiable,except on inference, and have been adopted merely to answer scientific necessities. Furthermore, the ideal triangle -- \"as the abstractidea of a triangular body, and, therefore, as the type of an abstract idea\" -- accomplished and carried out to perfection the doublesymbolism intended. As an emblem applicable to the objective idea, the simple triangle became a solid. When repeated in stone onthe four cardinal points, it assumed the shape of the Pyramid -- the symbol of the phenomenal merging into the noumenal Universeof thought -- at the apex of the four triangles; and, as an \"imaginary figure constructed of three mathematical lines,\" it symbolized thesubjective spheres -- those lines \"enclosing a mathematical space -- which is equal to nothing enclosing nothing.\" Because, to thesenses and the untrained consciousness of profane and scientist, everything beyond the line of differentiated matter -- i.e., outside of,and beyond the realm of even the most spiritual substance -- has to remain for ever equal to nothing. It is the AIN-SOPH -- the No-THING.Yet these \"phantoms of the mind\" are in truth no greater abstractions than the abstract ideas in general upon evolution and physicaldevelopment -- e.g., Gravity, Matter, Force, etc. -- on which the exact sciences are based. Our most eminent chemists and physicistsare earnestly pursuing the not hopeless attempt of finally tracing to its hiding-place the protyle, or the basic line of the Pythagoreantriangle. The latter is, as said, the grandest conception imaginable, as it symbolizes both the ideal and the visible universes.* For if\"the possible unit is only a possibility as an actuality of nature, as an individual of any kind,\" and as every individual natural object iscapable of division, and by division loses its unity, or ceases to be a unit,** it is so only in the realm of exact sciences in a world asdeceptive as it is illusive. In the realm of the Esoteric sciences the unit divided ad infinitum, instead of losing its unity, approacheswith every division the planes of the only eternal REALITY. The eye of the SEER can follow and behold it in all its pregenetic glory.This same idea of the reality of the subjective, and the unreality of the objective universes, is found at the bottom of the Pythagoreanand Platonic teachings -- limited to the Elect alone; for[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"* In the world of Form, having found its expression in the Pyramids, Symbolism has in them both a triangle and a square, with theirfour co-equal triangles or surfaces, the four basic points, and the fifth -- the apex.** \"New Aspects of Life.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 618 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Porphyry, speaking of the Monad and the Duad, says that the former only was considered substantial and real, \"that most simpleBeing, the cause of all unity and the measure of all things.\"But the Duad, although the origin of Evil, or Matter -- thence unreal in philosophy -- is still Substance during Manvantara, and is oftencalled the third monad, in Occultism, and the connecting line as between two Points, . . . or Numbers which proceeded from THAT,\"which was before all Numbers,\" as expressed by Rabbi Barahiel. And from this Duad proceeded all the Scintillas of the three upperand the four lower worlds or planes -- which are in constant interaction and correspondence. This is a teaching which the Kabala hasin common with Eastern Occultism. For in the occult philosophy there are the \"ONE Cause\" and the \"Primal Cause,\" which latter thusbecomes, paradoxically, the second, as clearly expressed by the author of the \"Qabbalah, from the philosophical writings of IbnGabirol,\" -- \"in the treatment of the Primal cause, two things must be considered, the Primal Cause per se, and the relation andconnection of the Primal Cause with the visible and unseen universe.\" Thus he shows the early Hebrews following in the steps of theOriental philosophy -- Chaldean, Persian, Hindu, Arabic, etc. Their Primal Cause was designated at first \"by the triadic Shaddai, the(triune) Almighty, subsequently by the Tetragrammaton, YHVH, symbol of the Past, Present, and Future,\" and, let us add, of theeternal IS, or the I AM. Moreover, in the Kabala the name YHVH (or Jehovah) expresses a He and a She, male and female, two inone, or Hokhmah and Binah, and his, or rather their Shekinah or synthesizing spirit (grace), which makes again of the Duad a Triad.This is demonstrated in the Jewish Liturgy for Pentecost, and the prayer, \"In the name of Unity, of the Holy and Blessed Hu (He), andHis Shekinah, the Hidden and Concealed Hu, blessed be YHVH (the Quaternary) for ever.\" \"Ha is said to be masculine and YAHfeminine, together they make the [[hebrew]] i.e., one YHVH. One, but of a male-female nature. The Shekinah is always considered inthe Qabbalah as feminine\" (p. 175). And so it is considered in the exoteric Puranas, for Shekinah is no more than Sakti -- the femaledouble or lining of any god, in such case. And so it was with the early Christians whose Holy Spirit was feminine, as Sophia was withthe Gnostics. But in the transcendental Chaldean Kabala or \"Book of Numbers,\" \"Shekinah\" is sexless, and the purest abstraction, aState, like Nirvana, not subject or object or anything except an absolute PRESENCE.Thus it is only in the anthropomorphised systems (such as the Kabala has now greatly become) that Shekinah-Sakti is feminine. Assuch she becomes the Duad of Pythagoras, the two straight lines of the symbol that can never meet, which therefore form nogeometrical figure and are------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 619 THE MONAD OF LEIBNITZ.the symbol of matter. Out of this Duad, when united in one basic line of the triangle on the lower plane (the upper Triangle of theSephirothal Tree), emerge the Elohim, or Deity in Cosmic Nature, with the true Kabalists the lowest designation, translated in theBible \"God\" (see the same work and page).* Out of these issue the Scintillas.The Scintillas are the \"Souls,\" and these Souls appear in the three-fold form of Monads (units), atoms and gods -- according to ourteaching. \"Every atom becomes a visible complex unit (a molecule), and once attracted into the sphere of terrestrial activity, theMonadic Essence, passing through the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, becomes man.\" (Esot. Catechism.) Again, \"God,Monad, and Atom are the correspondences of Spirit, Mind, and Body (Atma, Manas and Sthula Sarira) in man.\" In their septenaryaggregation they are the \"Heavenly Man\" (see Kabala for the latter term); thus, terrestrial man is the provisional reflection of theHeavenly. . . . . \"The Monads (Jivas) are the Souls of the Atoms, both are the fabric in which the Chohans (Dhyanis, gods) cloththemselves when a form is needed.\" (Esot. Cat.)This relates to Cosmic and sub-planetary Monads, not to the Super-Cosmic Monas (the Pythagorean Monad) as called, in its syntheticcharacter, by the Pantheistical Peripatetics. The Monads of the present dissertation are treated from the standpoint of theirindividuality, as atomic Souls, before these atoms descend into pure terrestrial form. For this descent into concrete matter marks themedial point of their own individual pilgrimage. Here, losing in the mineral kingdom their individuality, they begin to ascend throughthe seven states of terrestrial evolution to that point where a correspondence is firmly established between the human and Deva(divine) consciousness. At present, however, we are not concerned with their terrestrial metamorphoses and tribulations, but with theirlife and behaviour in Space, on planes wherein the eye of the most intuitional chemist and physicist cannot reach them -- unless,indeed, he develops in himself highly clairvoyant faculties.It is well known that Leibnitz came several times very near the truth, but defined monadic evolution incorrectly, which is not to bewondered at, since he was not an INITIATE, nor even a Mystic, only a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Such recent works as the Qabbalah of Mr. Isaac Myer and of Mr. S.

Yet no psycho-physicist ever came nearer than he has to the esoteric general outline of evolution. Thisevolution -- viewed from its several standpoints -- i.e., as the universal and the individualized Monad; and the chief aspects of theEvolving Energy, after differentiation -- the purely Spiritual, the Intellectual, the Psychic and the Physical -- may be thus formulatedas an invariable law; a descent of Spirit into Matter, equivalent to an ascent in physical evolution; a re-ascent from the depths ofmateriality towards its status quo ante, with a corresponding dissipation of concrete form and substance up to the LAYA state, or whatScience calls \"the zero-point,\" and beyond.These states -- once the spirit of Esoteric philosophy is grasped -- become absolutely necessary from simple logical and analogicalconsiderations. Physical Science having now ascertained, through its department of Chemistry, the invariable law of this evolution ofatoms -- from their \"protylean\" state down to that of a physical and then a chemical particle (or molecule) -- cannot well reject thesame as a general law. And once it is forced by its enemies -- Metaphysics and Psychology* -- out of its alleged impregnablestrongholds, it will find it more difficult than it now appears to refuse room in the Spaces of SPACE to Planetary Spirits (gods),Elementals, and even the Elementary Spooks or Ghosts, and others. Already Figuier and Paul D'Assier, two Positivists andMaterialists, have succumbed before this logical necessity. Other and still greater Scientists will follow in that \"intellectual FALL.\"They will be driven out of their position not by spiritual, theosophical, or any other physical or even mental phenomena, but simply bythe enormous gaps and chasms that open daily and will still be opening before them, as one discovery follows the other, until theyare finally knocked off their feet by the ninth wave of simple common sense.Here is an example: Prof. W. Crookes' latest discovery of what he has named protyle. In the \"Notes on the Bhagavat Gita,\" by one ofthe best metaphysicians and Vedantic scholars in India,** the lecturer, referring cautiously to \"things occult\" in that great Indianesoteric work, makes a remark as suggestive as it is strictly correct. \". . . Into the details of the evolution of the solar system itself,\" hesays, \"it is not necessary for me to enter.

This lecturewill give you some idea of the way in which these Elements spring from Vishwanara,* the most objective of these three principles,which seems to stand in the place of the protyle mentioned in that lecture. Except in a few particulars, this lecture seems to give theoutlines of the theory of physical evolution on the plane of Vishwanara, and is, so far as I know, the nearest approach made bymodern investigators TO THE REAL OCCULT THEORY on the subject.\"These words will be re-echoed and approved by every Eastern Occultist. Much from the lectures by Prof. Crookes has already beenquoted in § XII. of these Addenda. Since then, there has been another lecture delivered, as remarkable as the first one, on the\"Genesis of the Elements,\"** and also a third one. Here we have almost a corroboration of the teachings of Esoteric philosophyconcerning the mode of primeval evolution. It is, indeed, as near an approach, made by a great scholar and specialist in chemistry,***to the Secret Doctrine, as could be made apart from the application of the monads and atoms to the dogmas of pure transcendentalmetaphysics, and their connection and correlation with \"Gods and intelligent Conscious Monads.\" But Chemistry is now on itsascending plane, thanks to one of its highest European representatives. It is impossible for it to go back to that day when materialismregarded its sub-elements as absolutely simple and homogeneous bodies, which it had raised, in its blindness, to the rank ofelements. The mask has been snatched off by too clever a hand for there to be any fear of a new disguise. And after years ofpseudology, of bastard molecules parading under the name of elements, behind and beyond which there could be nought but void, agreat professor of chemistry asks once more: \"What are these elements, whence do they come, what is their signification? . . . . Theseelements perplex us in our researches, baffle us in our speculations, and haunt us in our very dreams. They stretch like an unknownsea before us mocking -- mystifying, and murmuring strange revelations and possibilities.\" (Gen. of Elem., p. 1.)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Vishwanara is not merely the manifested objective world, but the one physical basis (the horizontal line of the triangle) from whichthe whole objective world starts into existence.\" And this is the Cosmic Duad, the androgynous Substance.

But now one of the great truths has dawned upon an eminent professor of modern exactscience, and he fearlessly proclaims as a fundamental axiom that Science has not made itself acquainted, so far, with real simpleelements. For Prof. Crookes tells his audience:\"If I venture to say that our commonly received elements are NOT simple and primordial, that they have not arisen by chance or havenot been created in a desultory and mechanical manner, but have been evolved from simpler matters -- or perhaps, indeed, from onesole kind of matter -- I do but give formal utterance to an idea which has been, so to speak, for some time 'in the air' of science.Chemists, physicists, philosophers of the highest merit, declare explicitly their belief that the seventy (or thereabouts) elements of ourtext-books are not the pillars of Hercules which we must never hope to pass.\" . . . \"Philosophers in the present as in the past -- men whocertainly have not worked in the laboratory -- have reached the same view from another side.\" Thus Mr. Herbert Spencer records hisconviction that 'the chemical atoms are produced from the true or physical atoms by processes of evolution under conditions whichchemistry has not yet been able to produce.' . . . \"And the poet has forestalled the philosopher. Milton ('Paradise Lost,' Book V.) makesthe Archangel Raphael say to Adam, instinct with the evolutionary idea, that the Almighty had created. . . 'One first matter, allIndued with various forms, various degreesOf substance.' \"Nevertheless, the idea would have remained crystallized \"in the air of Science,\" and never have descended into the thick atmosphereof materialism and profane mortals for years to come, perhaps, had not Professor Crookes bravely and fearlessly reduced it to itssimple elements, and thus publicly forced it on Scientific notice. \"An idea,\" says Plutarch, \"is a being incorporeal, which has nosubsistence by itself, but gives figure and form unto shapeless matter, and becomes the cause of the manifestation.\" (De Placit.Philos.) The revolution produced in old chemistry by Avogadro was the first page in the Volume of New Chemistry. Mr. Crookes hasnow turned the second page, and is boldly pointing to what may be the last. For once protyle accepted and recognized -- as invisibleEther was, both being logical and scientific necessities -- Chemistry will have virtually ceased to live: it will reappear in itsreincarnation as New Alchemy, or METACHEMISTRY. The discoverer of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 623 THE GENESIS OF ATOMS.radiant matter will have vindicated in time the Archaic Aryan works on Occultism and even the Vedas and Puranas. For what are themanifested \"Mother,\" the \"Father-Son-Husband\" (Aditi and Daksha, a form of Brahma, as Creators) and the \"Son,\" -- the three \"First-born\" -- but simply Hydrogen, Oxygen, and that which in its terrestrial manifestation is called nitrogen. Even the exoteric descriptionsof the \"First Born\" triad give all the characteristics of these three gases. Priestley, the \"discoverer\" of Oxygen, or that which was knownin the highest antiquity!Yet all the ancient, mediaeval, and modern poets and philosophers have been anticipated even in the exoteric Hindu books.Descartes' plenum of matter differentiated into particles; Leibnitz's Ethereal Fluid and Kant's \"primitive fluid\" dissolved into itselements; Kepler's Solar Vortex and Systemic Vortices; in short, from the Elemental Vortices inaugurated by the universal mind --through Anaxagoras, down to Galileo, Torricelli, and Swedenborg, and after them to the latest speculations by European mystics -- allthis is found in the Hindu hymns and Mantras to the \"Gods, Monads, and Atoms,\" in their fulness, for they are inseparable. In esotericteachings, the most transcendental conceptions of the universe and its mysteries, as the most (seemingly) materialistic speculationsare found reconciled, because those sciences embrace the whole scope of evolution from Spirit to matter. As declared by anAmerican Theosophist, \"The Monads (of Leibnitz) may from one point of view be called force, from another matter. To occultScience, force and matter are only two sides of the same SUBSTANCE.\" (\"Path,\" No. 10, p. 297.)Let the reader remember these \"Monads\" of Leibnitz, every one of which is a living mirror of the universe, every monad reflectingevery other, and compare this view and definition with certain Sanskrit stanzas (Slokas) translated by Sir William Jones, in which it issaid that the creative source of the Divine Mind, . . . \"Hidden in a veil of thick darkness, formed mirrors of the atoms of the world, andcast reflection from its own face on every atom. . . . .\"When, therefore, Professor Crookes declares that \"If we can show how the so-called chemical elements might have been generated weshall be able to fill up a formidable gap in our knowledge of the universe, . . .\" the answer is ready. The theoretical knowledge iscontained in the esoteric meaning of every Hindu cosmogony in the Puranas; the practical demonstration thereof -- is in the hands ofthose who will not be recognised in this century, save by the very few. The scientific possibilities of various discoveries, that mustinexorably lead exact Science into the acceptation of Eastern Occult views, which contain all the requisite material for the filling ofthose \"gaps,\" are, so far, at the mercy of modern materialism. It is only by working in the direction"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 624 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.taken by Professor Crookes that there is any hope for the recognition of a few, hitherto Occult, truths.Meanwhile, one thirsting to have a glimpse at a practical diagram of the evolution of primordial matter, which, separating anddifferentiating under the impulse of cyclic law, divides itself into a septenary gradation of SUBSTANCE (from a general view), can dono better than examine the plates attached to Mr. Crookes' lecture: \"Genesis of the Elements,\" and ponder well over some passages ofthe text. In one place (p. 11) he says:--\". . . . Our notions of a chemical element have expanded. Hitherto the molecule has been regarded as an aggregate of two or moreatoms, and no account has been taken of the architectural design on which these atoms have been joined. We may consider that thestructure of a chemical element is more complicated than has hitherto been supposed. Between the molecules we are accustomed todeal with in chemical reactions and ultimate atoms as first created, come smaller molecules or aggregates of physical atoms; thensub-molecules differ one from the other, according to the position they occupied in the yttrium edifice.\"\"Perhaps this hypothesis can be simplified if we imagine yttrium to be represented by a five-shilling piece. By chemical fractionation Ihave divided it into five separate shillings, and find that these shillings are not counterparts, but like the carbon atoms in the benzolring, have the impress of their position, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, stamped on them. . . . If I throw my shillings into the melting-pot or dissolve themchemically, the mint stamp disappears and they all turn out to be silver.\" . . .This will be the case with all the atoms and molecules when they have separated from their compound forms and bodies -- whenpralaya sets in. Reverse the case, and imagine the dawn of a new manvantara. The pure \"silver\" of the absorbed material will oncemore separate into SUBSTANCE, which will generate \"Divine Essences\" whose \"principles\"* are the primary elements, the sub-elements, the physical energies and subjective and objective matter; or, as these are epitomised -- GODS, MONADS, and ATOMS. Ifleaving for one moment the metaphysical or transcendental side of the question, -- dropping out of the present consideration thesupersensuous and intelligent beings and entities believed in by the Kabalists and Christians -- we turn to the atomical theory ofevolution, the occult teachings are still found corroborated by exact Science and its confessions, as far, at least, as regards thesupposed \"simple\" elements, now suddenly[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Corresponding on the cosmic scale with the Spirit, Soul-mind, Life, and the three Vehicles -- the astral, the Mayavic and the physicalbodies (of mankind) whatever division is made.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 625 HERMES OR HUXLEY?degraded into poor and distant relatives -- not even second cousins to the latter. For we are told by Prof. Crookes that:\"Hitherto, it has been considered that if the atomic weight of a metal, determined by different observers, setting out from differentcompounds, was always found to be constant . . . then such metal must rightly take rank among the simple or elementary bodies. Welearn . . . that this is no longer the case. Again, we have here wheels within wheels. Gadolinium is not an element but a compound. .. We have shown that yttrium is a complex of five or more new constituents. And who shall venture to gainsay that each of theseconstituents, if attacked in some different manner, and if the result were submitted to a test more delicate and searching than theradiant-matter test, might not be still further divisible? Where, then, is the actual ultimate element? As we advance it recedes like thetantalizing mirage lakes and groves seen by the tired and thirsty traveller in the desert. Are we in our quest for truth to be thus deludedand baulked? The very idea of an element, as something absolutely primary and ultimate, seems to be growing less and less distinct.. .\" (p. 16).On page 429 of Isis Unveiled, Vol. I., we said that \"the mystery of first creation, which was ever the despair of Science, isunfathomable unless they (the Scientists) accept the doctrine of Hermes. They will have to follow in the footsteps of the Hermetists.\"Our prophecy begins to assert itself.But between Hermes and Huxley there is a middle course and point. Let the men of Science only throw a bridge half-way, and thinkseriously over the theories of Leibnitz. We have shown our theories with regard to atomic evolution -- their last formation intocompound chemical molecules being produced within our terrestrial workshops in the earth's atmosphere and not elsewhere -- asstrangely agreeing with the evolution of atoms shown on Mr. Crookes' plates. Several times already it was stated in this volume thatMartanda (the Sun) had evolved and aggregated, together with his smaller seven Brothers, from his Mother's (Aditi's) bosom, thatbosom being prima MATER-ia -- the lecturer's primordial protyle. Esoteric doctrines teach the existence of \"an antecedent form ofenergy having periodic cycles of ebb and swell, rest and activity\" (p. 21) -- and behold a great scholar in Science now asking the worldto accept this as one of the postulates. We have shown the \"Mother,\" fiery and hot, becoming gradually cool and radiant, and thatsame Scientist claims as his second postulate, a scientific necessity, it would seem -- \"an internal action akin to cooling, operatingslowly in the protyle.\" Occult Science teaches that \"Mother\" lies stretched in infinity (during Pralaya) as the great Deep, the \"dryWaters of Space,\" according to the quaint expression in the Catechism, and becomes wet------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 626 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"only after the separation and the moving over its face of Narayana, the \"Spirit which is invisible Flame, which never burns, but sets onfire all that it touches, and gives it life and generation.\"* And now Science tells us that \"the first-born element . . . most nearly alliedto protyle\" . . . would be \"hydrogen . . . which for some time would be the only existing form of matter\" in the Universe. What says OldScience? It answers: just so; but we would call hydrogen and oxygen (which instils the fire of life into the \"Mother\" by incubation) inthe pregenetic and even pre-geological ages -- the Spirit, the noumenon of that which becomes in its grossest form oxygen andhydrogen and nitrogen on Earth -- nitrogen being of no divine origin, but merely an earth-born cement to unite other gases and fluids,and serve as a sponge to carry in itself the breath of LIFE -- pure air.** Before these gases and fluids become what they are in ouratmosphere, they are interstellar Ether; still earlier and on a deeper plane -- something else, and so on in infinitum. The eminent andlearned gentleman must pardon an Occultist for quoting him at such length; but such is the penalty of a Fellow of the Royal Societywho approaches so near the precincts of the Sacred Adytum of Occult mysteries as virtually to overstep the forbidden boundaries.But it is time to leave modern physical science and turn to the psychological and metaphysical side of the question. We would onlyremark that to the \"two very reasonable postulates\" required by the eminent lecturer, \"to get a glimpse of some few of the secrets sodarkly hidden\" behind \"the door of the Unknown\" -- a third should be added*** -- lest no battering at it should avail; the postulate thatLeibnitz, in his speculations, stood on a firm groundwork of fact and truth. The admirable and thoughtful synopsis of thesespeculations -- as given by John Theodore Merz in his \"Leibnitz\" -- shows how nearly he has brushed the hidden secrets of esotericTheogony in his Monadologie. And yet that philosopher has hardly risen in his speculations above the first planes, the lowerprinciples of the Cosmic Great Body. His theory soars to no loftier heights than those of the manifested life, self-consciousness andintelligence, leaving the regions of the earlier post-genetic mysteries untouched, as his ethereal fluid is post-planetary.But this third postulate will hardly be accepted by the modern men[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The Lord is a consuming fire.\" . . . \"In him was life, and the life was the light of men.\"** Which if separated ALCHEMICALLY would yield the Spirit of Life, and its Elixir.*** Foremost of all, the postulate that there is no such thing in Nature as inorganic substances or bodies.

They will never become anti-Cartesianin this generation; nor will they admit that \"this property of inertia is not a purely geometrical property, that it points to the existence ofsomething in external bodies which is not extension merely.\" This is Leibnitz's idea as analyzed by Mertz, who adds that he called thissomething Force, and maintained that external things were endowed with Force, and that in order to be the bearers of this force theymust have a substance, for they are not lifeless and inert masses, but the centres and bearers of form, a purely esoteric claim, sinceforce was with Leibnitz an active principle, the division between mind and matter disappearing by this conclusion. But --\"The mathematical and dynamical inquiries of Leibnitz would not have led to the same result in the mind of a purely scientificinquirer. But Leibnitz was not a scientific man in the modern sense of the word. Had he been so, he might have worked out theconception of energy, defined mathematically the ideas of force and mechanical work, and arrived at the conclusion that even forpurely scientific purposes it is desirable to look upon force, not as a primary quantity, but as a quantity derived from some othervalue.\"But, luckily for truth --\"Leibnitz was a philosopher; and as such he had certain primary principles, which biassed him in favour of certain conclusions, and hisdiscovery that external things were substances endowed with force was at once used for the purpose of applying these principles. Oneof these principles was the law of continuity, the conviction that all the world was connected, that there were no gaps and chasmswhich could not be bridged over. The contrast of extended thinking substances was unbearable to him. The definition of the extendedsubstances had already become untenable: it was natural that a similar inquiry was made into the definition of mind, the thinkingsubstance. . .\"The divisions made by Leibnitz, however incomplete and faulty from the standpoint of Occultism, show a spirit of metaphysicalintuition to which no man of science, not Descartes -- not even Kant -- has ever reached. With him there existed ever an infinitegradation of thought.

The mathematician, in order to calculategeometrical figures, had been obliged to divide them into an infinite number of infinitely small parts, and the physicist saw no limit tothe divisibility of matter into atoms. The bulk through which external things seemed to fill space was a property which they acquiredonly through the coarseness of our senses. . . . Leibnitz followed these arguments to some extent, but he could not rest content inassuming that matter was composed of a finite number of very small parts. His mathematical mind forced him to carry out theargument in infinitum. And what became of the atoms then? They lost their extension and they retained only their property ofresistance; they were the centres of force. They were reduced to mathematical points . . . but if their extension in space was nothing,so much fuller was their inner life. Assuming that inner existence, such as that of the human mind, is a new dimension, not ageometrical but a metaphysical dimension . . . having reduced the geometrical extension of the atoms to nothing, Leibnitz endowedthem with an infinite extension in the direction of their metaphysical dimension. After having lost sight of them in the world of space,the mind has, as it were, to dive into a metaphysical world to find and grasp the real essence of what appears in space merely as amathematical point. . . . As a cone stands on its point, or a perpendicular straight line cuts a horizontal plane only in onemathematical point, but may extend infinitely in height and depth, so the essences of things real have only a punctual existence inthis physical world of space; but have an infinite depth of inner life in the metaphysical world of thought . . . \" (p. 144).This is the spirit, the very root of occult doctrine and thought. The \"Spirit-Matter\" and \"Matter-Spirit\" extend infinitely in depth, andlike \"the essence of things\" of Leibnitz, our essence of things real is at the seventh depth; while the unreal and gross matter of Scienceand the external world, is at the lowest end of our perceptive senses. The Occultist knows the worth or worthlessness of the latter.The student must now be shown the fundamental distinction between the system of Leibnitz* and that of occult philosophy, on thequestion of the Monads, and this may be done with his Monadology before us. It may be correctly stated that were Leibnitz' andSpinoza's systems[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The real spelling of the name -- as spelt by himself -- is Leibniz. He was of Slavonian descent though a German by birth.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 629 SPINOZA AND LEIBNITZ.reconciled, the essence and Spirit of esoteric philosophy would be made to appear. From the shock of the two -- as opposed to theCartesian system -- emerge the truths of the Archaic doctrine. Both opposed the metaphysics of Descartes. His idea of the contrast oftwo substances -- Extension and Thought -- radically differing from each other and mutually irreducible, was too arbitrary and toounphilosophical for them. Thus Leibnitz made of the two Cartesian substances two attributes of one universal unity, in which he sawGod. Spinoza recognised but one universal indivisible substance and absolute ALL, like Parabrahmam. Leibnitz, on the contraryperceived the existence of a plurality of substances. There was but ONE for Spinoza; for Leibnitz an infinitude of Beings, from, and in,the One. Hence, though both admitted but one real Entity, while Spinoza made it impersonal and indivisible, Leibnitz divided hispersonal Deity into a number of divine and semi-divine Beings. Spinoza was a subjective, Leibnitz an objective Pantheist, yet bothwere great philosophers in their intuitive perceptions.Now, if these two teachings were blended together and each corrected by the other, -- and foremost of all the One Reality weeded ofits personality -- there would remain as sum total a true spirit of esoteric philosophy in them; the impersonal, attributeless, absolutedivine essence which is no \"Being,\" but the root of all being. Draw a deep line in your thought between that ever-incognizableessence, and the, as invisible, yet comprehensible Presence (Mulaprakriti), or Schekinah, from beyond and through which vibrates theSound of the Verbum, and from which evolve the numberless hierarchies of intelligent Egos, of conscious as of semi-conscious,perceptive and apperceptive Beings, whose essence is spiritual Force, whose Substance is the Elements and whose Bodies (whenneeded) are the atoms -- and our doctrine is there. For, says Leibnitz, \"the primitive Element of every material body being Force,which has none of the characteristics of (objective) matter -- it can be conceived but can never be the object of any imaginativerepresentation.\" That which was for him the primordial and ultimate element in every body and object was thus not the materialatoms, or molecules, necessarily more or less extended, as those of Epicurus and Gassendi, but, as Mertz shows, immaterial andmetaphysical atoms, 'mathematical points'; or real souls, -- as explained by Henri Lachelier (Professeur agrege de Philosophie), hisFrench biographer. \"That which exists outside of us in an absolute manner, are Souls whose essence is force,\" (Monadologie, Introd.).Thus, reality in the manifested world is composed of a unity of units, so to say, immaterial (from our stand-point) and infinite. ThisLeibnitz calls \"Monads,\" Eastern philosophy \"Jivas\" -- and Occultism gives it, with the Kabalists and all the Christians, a variety ofnames.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 630 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.They are with us, as with Leibnitz -- \"the expression of the universe,\"* and every physical point is but the phenomenal expression ofthe noumenal, metaphysical point. His distinction between perception and apperception, is the philosophical though dim expressionof the Esoteric teachings. His \"reduced universes,\" of which \"there are as many as there are Monads\" -- is the chaotic representation ofour Septenary System with its divisions and sub-divisions."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"As to the relation his Monads bear to our Dhyan-Chohans, Cosmic Spirits, Devas and Elementals, we may reproduce briefly theopinion of a learned and thoughtful theosophist, Mr. H. A. Bjerregaard, on the subject. In an excellent paper \"On the Elementals, theElementary Spirits, and the relationship between them and Human Beings,\" read by him before the \"Aryan Theosophical Society ofNew York\" (see PATH, Nos. 10 and 11, of Jan. and Feb. 1887), Mr. Bjerregaard formulates distinctly his opinion. . . . . \"To Spinoza,substance is dead and inactive, but to Leibnitz's penetrating mind everything is living activity and active energy. In holding this view,he comes infinitely nearer the Orient than any other thinker of his day, or after him. His discovery that an active energy forms theessence of Substance is a principle that places him in direct relationship to the Seers of the East.\"And the lecturer proceeds to show that to Leibnitz atoms and elements are centres of force, or rather \"spiritual beings whose verynature is to act,\" for the elementary particles are not acting mechanically, but from an internal principle. They are incorporealspiritual units (\"substantial,\" however, but not immaterial in our sense) inaccessible to all changes from without, and indestructible byany external force. Leibnitz's monads, adds the lecturer, \"differ from atoms in the following particulars, which are very important for usto remember, otherwise we shall not be able to see the difference between elementals and mere matter.\" . . . . \"Atoms are notdistinguished from each other, they are qualitatively alike; but one monad differs from every other monad qualitatively; and every oneis a peculiar world to itself. Not so with atoms; they are absolutely alike quantitatively and qualitatively, and possess no individualityof their own.** Again, the atoms (molecules,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Leibnitz's Dynamism,\" says Professor Lachelier, \"would offer but little difficulty if, with him, the Monad had remained a simple atomof blind force. But . . . .\" One perfectly understands the perplexity of modern materialism!** Leibnitz was an absolute Idealist in maintaining that \"material atoms are contrary to reason\" (Systeme nouveau, Erdmann, p. 126.col. 2). For him matter was a simple representation of the monad, whether human or atomic. Monads, he thought (as we do), areeverywhere. Thus the human soul is a monad, and every cell in the human body has its monad, as every cell in animal, vegetable,and even in the (so-called) inorganic bodies. His atoms are the molecules of modern Science, and his monads those simple[[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 631 MAYA AND MAHAMAYA.rather) of materialistic philosophy can be considered as extended and divisible, while the monads are mere mathematical points andindivisible. Finally, and this is a point where these monads of Leibnitz closely resemble the elementals of mystic philosophy -- thesemonads are representative Beings. Every monad reflects every other. Every monad is a living mirror of the Universe within its ownsphere. And mark this, for upon it depends the power possessed by these monads, and upon this depends the work they can do for us;in mirroring the world, the monads are not mere passive reflective agents, but spontaneously self-active; they produce the imagesspontaneously, as the soul does a dream. In every monad, therefore, the adept may read everything, even the future. Every monad orElemental is a looking-glass that can speak. . .\"It is at this point that Leibnitz's philosophy breaks down. There is no provision made, nor any distinction established, between the\"Elemental\" monad and that of a high Planetary Spirit, or even the human monad or Soul. He even goes so far as to sometimesdoubt whether \"God has ever made anything but Monads or substances without extension.\" (Examen des Principes du P.Malebranche.) He draws a distinction between Monads and Atoms,* because, as he repeatedly states, \"bodies with all their qualitiesare only phenomenal, like the rainbow. . . . Corpora omnia cum omnibus qualitatibus suis non sunt aliud quam phenomena benefundata, ut Iris\" (Letter to Father Desbosses, Correspondence, letter xviii.) -- but soon after he finds a provision for this in a substantialcorrespondence, a certain metaphysical bond between the monads -- vinculum substantiale. Esoteric philosophy, teaching anobjective Idealism -- though it regards the objective Universe and all in it as Maya, temporary illusion -- draws a practical distinctionbetween collective illusion, Mahamaya, from the purely metaphysical stand-point, and the objective relations in it between variousconscious Egos so long as this illusion lasts. The adept, therefore, may read the future in an Elemental Monad, but he has to draw forthis object a great number of them, as each monad represents only a portion of the Kingdom it belongs to. \"It is not in the object, butin the modification of the cognition of the object that the Monads are limited. They all go confusedly to the infinite, to the all, butthey are all limited and distinguished by the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] atoms that materialistic Science takes on faith, though it will never succeed in interviewingthem -- except in imagination. But Leibnitz is rather contradictory in his views about Monads. He speaks of his Metaphysical Pointsand Formal Atoms, at one time as realities, occupying space; at another as pure Spiritual ideas; then again endows them withobjectivity and aggregates and positions in their co-relations.* The atoms of Leibnitz have, in truth, nothing but the name in common with the atoms of the Greek Materialists, or even themolecules of modern Science. He calls them formal atoms, and compares them to the substantial forms of Aristotle.

Then come the Elementals, or Monads, who formcollectively and unconsciously the grand Universal Mirrors of everything connected with their respective realms. Lastly, the atoms, ormaterial molecules, which are informed in their turn by their apperceptive monads, just as every cell in a human body is so informed.(See the closing pages of Book I.) There are shoals of such informed atoms which, in their turn, inform the molecules; an infinitude ofmonads, or Elementals proper, and countless spiritual Forces -- Monadless, for they are pure incorporealities,*** except under certainlaws, when they assume a form -- not necessarily human. Whence the substance that clothes them -- the apparent organism theyevolve around their centres? The Formless (\"Arupa\") Radiations, existing in the harmony of Universal Will, and being what we termthe collective or the aggregate of Cosmic Will on the plane of the subjective Universe, unite together an infinitude of monads -- eachthe mirror of its own Universe -- and thus individualize[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Leibnitz, like Aristotle, calls the created or emanated monads (the Elementals issued from Cosmic Spirits or Gods) -- Entelechies,[[Entelecheia]] -- and \"incorporeal automata.\" (§ 18, Monadologie.)** These three \"rough divisions\" correspond to spirit, mind (or soul), and body, in the human constitution.*** Brother C. H. A. Bjerregaard, in his lecture (already mentioned), warns his audience not to regard the Sephiroth too much asindividualities, but to avoid at the same time seeing in them abstractions. \"We shall never arrive at the truth,\" he says, \"much less thepower of associating with those celestials, until we return to the simplicity and fearlessness of the primitive ages, when men mixedfreely with the gods, and the gods descended among men and guided them in truth and holiness\" (No. 10, Path) . . . . \"There areseveral designations for 'angels' in the Bible which clearly show that beings like the Elementals of the Kabala and the monads ofLeibnitz, must be understood by that term rather than that which is commonly understood. They are called 'morning stars,' 'flamingfires,' 'the mighty ones,' and St. Paul sees them in his cosmogonic vision as 'Principalities and Powers.' Such names as these precludethe idea of personality, and we find ourselves compelled to think of them as impersonal Existences . . . as an influence, a spiritualsubstance, or conscious Force.\" (Path, No. 11, p. 322.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 633 THE WHEELS OF LIFE.for the time being an independent mind, omniscient and universal; and by the same process of magnetic aggregation they create forthemselves objective, visible bodies, out of the interstellar atoms. For atoms and Monads, associated or dissociated, simple orcomplex, are, from the moment of the first differentiation, but the principles, corporeal, psychic and Spiritual, of the \"Gods,\" --themselves the Radiations of primordial nature. Thus, to the eye of the Seer, the higher Planetary Powers appear under two aspects:the subjective -- as influences, and the objective -- as mystic FORMS, which, under Karmic law, become a Presence, Spirit and Matterbeing One, as repeatedly stated. Spirit is matter on the seventh plane; matter is Spirit -- on the lowest point of its cyclic activity; andboth -- are MAYA.Atoms are called \"Vibrations\" in Occultism; also \"Sound\" -- collectively. This does not interfere with Mr. Tyndall's scientific discovery.He traced, on the lower rung of the ladder of monadic being, the whole course of the atmospheric vibrations -- and this constitutes theobjective part of the process in nature. He has traced and recorded the rapidity of their motion and transmission; the force of theirimpact; their setting up vibrations in the tympanum and their transmission of these to the stolithes, etc., etc., till the vibration of theauditory nerve commences -- and a new phenomenon now takes place: the subjective side of the process or the sensation of Sound.Does he perceive or see it? No; for his speciality is to discover the behaviour of matter. But why should not a psychic see it, a spiritualseer, whose inner Eye is opened, and who can see through the veil of matter? The waves and undulations of Science are allproduced by atoms propelling their molecules into activity from within. Atoms fill the immensity of Space, and by their continuousvibration are that MOTION which keeps the wheels of Life perpetually going. It is that inner work that produces the naturalphenomena called the correlation of Forces. Only, at the origin of every such \"force,\" there stands the conscious guiding noumenonthereof -- Angel or God, Spirit or Demon -- ruling powers, yet the same.As described by Seers -- those who can see the motion of the interstellar shoals, and follow them in their evolution clairvoyantly -- theyare dazzling, like specks of virgin snow in radiant sunlight. Their velocity is swifter than thought, quicker than any mortal physical eyecould follow, and, as well as can be judged from the tremendous rapidity of their course, the motion is circular. . . . . Standing on anopen plain, on a mountain summit especially, and gazing into the vast vault above and the spacial infinitudes around, the wholeatmosphere seems ablaze with them, the air soaked through with these dazzling coruscations.

The sight is so marvellous, that, as the Seer gazes into this inner world, and feelsthe scintillating points shoot past him, he is filled with awe at the thought of other, still greater mysteries, that lie beyond, and within,this radiant ocean. . . . .However imperfect and incomplete this explanation on \"Gods, Monads and Atoms,\" it is hoped that some students and theosophists,at least, will feel that there may be indeed a close relation between materialistic Science, and Occultism, which is the complementand missing soul of the former.-------XVI.CYCLIC EVOLUTION AND KARMA.IT is the Spiritual evolution of the inner, immortal man that forms the fundamental tenet in the Occult Sciences. To realize evendistantly such a process, the student has to believe (a) in the ONE Universal Life, independent of matter (or what Science regards asmatter); and (b) in the individual intelligences that animate the various manifestations of this Principle. Mr. Huxley does not believein \"Vital Force,\" others do. Dr. J. H. Hutchinson Sterling's work \"Concerning Protoplasm\" has made no small havoc of this dogmaticnegation. Professor Beale's decision is also in favour of a Vital Principle; and Dr. B. W. Richardson's lectures on the \"Nervous Ether,\"have been sufficiently quoted from. Thus, opinions are divided.The ONE LIFE is closely related to the one law which governs the World of Being -- KARMA. Exoterically, this is simply and literally\"action,\" or rather an \"effect-producing cause.\" Esoterically it is quite a different thing in its far-fetching moral effects. It is the unerringLAW OF RETRIBUTION. To say to those ignorant of the real significance, characteristics and awful importance of this eternalimmutable law, that no theological definition of a personal deity can give an idea of this impersonal, yet ever present and activePrinciple, is to speak in vain. Nor can it be called Providence. For Providence, with the Theists (the Christian Protestants, at any rate),rejoices in a personal male gender, while with the Roman Catholics it is a female potency, \"Divine Providence tempers His blessingsto secure their better effects,\" Wogan tells us. Indeed \"He\" tempers them, which Karma -- a sexless principle -- does not.Throughout the first two Parts, it was shown that, at the first flutter------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 635 THE ROOTS AND CAUSES.of renascent life, Svabhavat, \"the mutable radiance of the Immutable Darkness unconscious in Eternity,\" passes, at every new rebirthof Kosmos, from an inactive state into one of intense activity; that it differentiates, and then begins its work through thatdifferentiation. This work is KARMA.The Cycles are also subservient to the effects produced by this activity. \"The one Cosmic atom becomes seven atoms on the plane ofmatter, and each is transformed into a centre of energy; that same atom becomes seven rays on the plane of spirit, and the sevencreative forces of nature, radiating from the root-essence . . . . follow, one the right, the other the left path, separate till the end of theKalpa, and yet are in close embrace. What unites them? KARMA.\" The atoms emanated from the Central Point emanate in their turnnew centres of energy, which, under the potential breath of Fohat, begin their work from within without, and multiply other minorcentres. These, in the course of evolution and involution, form in their turn the roots or developing causes of new effects, from worldsand \"man-bearing\" globes, down to the genera, species, and classes of all the seven kingdoms* (of which we know only four). For \"theblessed workers have received the Thyan-kam, in the eternity\" (Book of \"The Aphorisms of Tson-ka-pa\").\"Thyan-kam\" is the power or knowledge of guiding the impulses of cosmic energy in the right direction.The true Buddhist, recognising no \"personal god,\" nor any \"Father\" and \"Creator of Heaven and Earth,\" still believes in an absoluteconsciousness, \"Adi-Buddhi\"; and the Buddhist philosopher knows that there are Planetary Spirits, the \"Dhyan Chohans.\" But thoughhe admits of \"spiritual lives,\" yet, as they are temporary in eternity, even they, according to his philosophy, are \"the maya of the day,\"the illusion of a \"day of Brahma,\" a short manvantara of 4,320,000,000 years. The \"Yin-Sin\" is not for the speculations of men, for theLord Buddha has strongly prohibited all such inquiry. If the Dhyan Chohans and all the invisible Beings -- the Seven Centres and theirdirect Emanations, the minor centres of Energy -- are the direct reflex of the ONE Light, yet men are far removed from these, since thewhole of the visible Kosmos consists of \"self-produced beings, the creatures of Karma.\" Thus regarding a personal God \"as only agigantic shadow thrown upon the void of space by the imagination of ignorant men,\"** they teach that only \"two things are(objectively) eternal, namely Akasa and Nirvana\"; and that these are ONE in reality, and but a maya when divided. \"Buddhists denycreation and cannot conceive of a Creator.\" \"Everything has come out of Akasa (or Svabhavat[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide Stanza VI.

Nothing ever came out ofnothing.\" (Buddhist Catechism.)If a Vedantic Brahmin of the Adwaita Sect, when asked whether he believes in the existence of God, is always likely to answer, asJacolliot was answered -- \"I am myself 'God';\" a Buddhist (a Sinhalese especially) would simply laugh, and say in reply, \"There is noGod; no Creation.\" Yet the root philosophy of both Adwaita and Buddhist scholars is identical, and both have the same respect foranimal life, for both believe that every creature on earth, however small and humble, \"is an immortal portion of the immortal matter\" -- for matter with them has quite another significance than it has with either Christian or materialist -- and that every creature is subjectto Karma.The answer of the Brahmin is one which would suggest itself to every ancient philosopher, Kabalist, and Gnostic of the early days. Itcontains the very spirit of the Delphic and Kabalistic commandments, for esoteric philosophy solved, ages ago, the problem of whatman was, is, and will be; of man's origin, life-cycle -- interminable in its duration of successive incarnations or rebirths -- and finally ofhis absorption into the source from which he started.But it is not physical Science that we can ever ask to read man for us, as the riddle of the Past, or that of the Future; since nophilosopher is able to tell us even what man is, as he is known both to physiology and psychology. In doubt whether man was \"a godor beast,\" he is now connected with the latter and derived from an animal. No doubt that the care of analyzing and classifying thehuman being as a terrestrial animal may be left to Science, which occultists -- of all men -- regard with veneration and respect. Theyrecognize its ground and the wonderful work done by it, the progress achieved in physiology, and even -- to a degree -- in biology. Butman's inner, spiritual, psychic, or even moral, nature cannot be left to the tender mercies of an ingrained materialism; for not even thehigher psychological philosophy of the West is able, in its present incompleteness and tendency towards a decided agnosticism, to dojustice to the inner; especially to his higher capacities and perceptions, and those states of consciousness, across the road to whichsuch authorities as Mill draw a strong line, saying \"So far, and no farther shalt thou go.\"No Occultist would deny that man -- no less than the elephant and the microbe, the crocodile and the lizard, the blade of grass or thecrystal -- is, in his physical formation, the simple product of the evolutionary forces of nature through a numberless series oftransformations; but he puts the case differently.It is not against zoological and anthropological discoveries, based on------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 637 THE SWING OF KARMA.the fossils of man and animal, that every mystic and believer in a divine soul inwardly revolts, but only against the uncalled-forconclusions built on preconceived theories and made to fit in with certain prejudices. Their premises may or may not be always true;and as some of these theories live but a short life, the deductions therefrom must ever be one-sided with materialistic evolutionists.Yet it is on the strength of such very ephemeral authority, that most of the men of science frequently receive undue honours wherethey deserve them the least.*To make the working of Karma, in the periodical renovations of the Universe, more evident and intelligible to the student when hearrives at the origin and evolution of man, he has now to examine with us the esoteric bearing of the Karmic Cycles upon UniversalEthics. The question is, do those mysterious divisions of time, called Yugas and Kalpas by the Hindus, and so very graphically --[[Kuklos]] -- \"cycle,\" ring or circle, by the Greeks, have any bearing upon, or any direct connection with, human life? Even exotericphilosophy explains that these perpetual circles of time are ever returning on themselves, periodically, and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We refer those who would regard the statement as an impertinence or irreverence against accepted Science, to Mr. JamesHutchinson Stirling's work concerning \"Protoplasm,\" which is a defence of a vital Principle versus the Molecularists -- Huxley, Tyndall,Vogt, and Co. -- and request them to examine whether it is true or not to say that the scientific premises may not be always correct, butthat they are accepted, nevertheless, to fill up a gap or a hole in some beloved materialistic hobby. Speaking of protoplasm and theorgans of man, as \"viewed by Mr. Huxley,\" the author says: \"Probably then, in regard to any continuity in protoplasm of power, of form,or of substance, we have seen lacunae enow. Nay, Mr. Huxley himself can be adduced in evidence on the same side. Not rarely dowe find in his essay admissions of PROBABILITY, where it is CERTAINTY that is alone in place. He says, for example: 'It is more thanprobable that when the vegetable world is thoroughly explored we shall find all plants in possession of the same powers.' When aconclusion is decidedly announced, it is rather disappointing to be told, as here, that the premisses are still to collect' (!!) . . . . . Again,here is a passage in which he is seen to cut his own 'basis' from beneath his own feet. After telling us that all forms of protoplasmconsist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen 'in very complex union,' he continues: 'To this complex combination, the nature ofwhich has never been determined with exactness (!!), the name of protein has been applied.' This, plainly, is an identification, on Mr.Huxley's own part, of protoplasm and protein; and what is said of one, being necessarily true of the other, it follows that he admits thenature of protoplasm never to have been determined with exactness, and that even in his eyes the lis is still sub judice. Thisadmission is strengthened by the words, too, 'If we use this term -- protein -- with such caution as may properly arise out of ourcomparative ignorance of the things for which it stands . . . etc., etc. (p. 33 and 34, in reply to Mr. Huxley in \"Yeast\").This is the eminent Huxley, the king of physiology and biology, who is proven playing at blind man's buff with premisses and facts.What may not the \"smaller fry\" of science do after this!"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 638 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.intelligently in Space and Eternity. There are \"Cycles of matter\"* and there are \"Cycles of Spiritual evolution.\" Racial, national, andindividual cycles. May not esoteric speculation allow us a still deeper insight into the workings of these?This idea is beautifully expressed in a very clever scientific work:--\"The possibility of rising to a comprehension of a system of co-ordination so far outreaching in time and space all reach of humanobservations, is a circumstance which signalizes the power of man to transcend the limitations of changing and inconsistent matter,and assert his superiority over all unstable and perishable forms of being. There is a method in the succession of events, and in therelation of co-existent things, which the mind of man seizes hold of; and by means of this as a clue, he runs back or forward overaeons of material history of which human experience can never testify. Events germinate and unfold. They have a past which isconnected with their present, and we feel a well-justified confidence that a future is appointed which will be similarly connected withthe present and the past. This continuity and unity of history repeat themselves before our eyes in all conceivable stages of progress.The phenomena furnish us the grounds for the generalization of two laws which are truly principles of scientific divination, by whichalone the human mind penetrates the sealed records of the past and the unopened pages of the future. The first of these is the law ofevolution, or, to phrase it for our purpose, the law of correlated successiveness or organized history in the individual, illustrated in thechanging phases of every single maturing system of results. . . . These thoughts summon into our immediate presence themeasureless past and the measureless future of material history. They seem almost to open vistas through infinity, and to endow thehuman intellect with an existence and a vision exempt from the limitations of time and space and finite causation, and lift it uptoward a sublime apprehension of the Supreme Intelligence whose dwelling place is Eternity.\" (\"World-Life,\" p. 535 and 548.)According to the teachings, Maya, or the illusive appearance of the marshalling of events and actions on this earth, changes, varyingwith nations and places. But the chief features of one's life are always in accordance with the \"Constellation\" one is born under, or, weshould say, with the characteristics of its animating principle or the deity that presides over it, whether we call it a Dhyan Chohan, asin Asia, or an Archangel, as with the Greek and Latin churches. In ancient Symbolism it was always the SUN (though the Spiritual, notthe visible, Sun was meant), that was supposed to send forth the chief Saviours and Avatars. Hence the connecting link between theBuddhas, the Avatars, and so many other incarnations of the highest SEVEN. The closer the approach to one's Prototype, \"inHeaven,\" the better for the mortal whose personality was chosen, by his own personal deity (the seventh principle), as its terrestrialabode. For, with every effort of will toward purification and unity[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The Cycles of Matter,\" a name given by Professor Winchell to an Essay of his written in 1860.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 639 THE NETWORK OF DESTINY.with that \"Self-god,\" one of the lower rays breaks and the spiritual entity of man is drawn higher and ever higher to the ray thatsupersedes the first, until, from ray to ray, the inner man is drawn into the one and highest beam of the Parent-SUN. Thus, \"the eventsof humanity do run coordinately with the number forms,\" since the single units of that humanity proceed one and all from the samesource -- the central and its shadow, the visible SUN. For the equinoxes and solstices, the periods and various phases of the Solarcourse, astronomically and numerically expressed, are only the concrete symbols of the eternally living verity, though they do seemabstract ideas to uninitiated mortals. And this explains the extraordinary numerical coincidences with geometrical relations, as shownby several authors.Yes; \"our destiny is written in the stars!\" Only, the closer the union between the mortal reflection MAN and his celestial PROTOTYPE,the less dangerous the external conditions and subsequent reincarnations -- which neither Buddhas nor Christs can escape. This is notsuperstition, least of all is it Fatalism. The latter implies a blind course of some still blinder power, and man is a free agent during hisstay on earth. He cannot escape his ruling Destiny, but he has the choice of two paths that lead him in that direction, and he canreach the goal of misery -- if such is decreed to him, either in the snowy white robes of the Martyr, or in the soiled garments of avolunteer in the iniquitous course; for, there are external and internal conditions which affect the determination of our will upon ouractions, and it is in our power to follow either of the two. Those who believe in Karma have to believe in destiny, which, from birth todeath, every man is weaving thread by thread around himself, as a spider does his cobweb; and this destiny is guided either by theheavenly voice of the invisible prototype outside of us, or by our more intimate astral, or inner man, who is but too often the evilgenius of the embodied entity called man. Both these lead on the outward man, but one of them must prevail; and from the verybeginning of the invisible affray the stern and implacable law of compensation steps in and takes its course, faithfully following thefluctuations. When the last strand is woven, and man is seemingly enwrapped in the net-work of his own doing, then he finds himselfcompletely under the empire of this self-made destiny. It then either fixes him like the inert shell against the immovable rock, orcarries him away like a feather in a whirlwind raised by his own actions, and this is -- KARMA.A materialist, treating upon the periodical creations of our globe, has expressed it in one sentence. \"The whole past of the Earth isnothing but an unfolded present.\" This was Buchner, who little suspected that he was repeating an axiom of the Occultists. It is quitetrue also, as Burmeister (quoted in \"Force and matter\") remarks, that------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 640 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"\"the historical investigation of the development of the Earth has proved that now and then rest upon the same base; that the past hasbeen developed in the same manner as the present rolls on; and that the Forces which were in action ever remained the same.\"The \"Forces\" -- their noumena rather -- are the same, of course; therefore, the phenomenal Forces must be the same also. But howcan any one feel so sure that the attributes of matter have not altered under the hand of Protean Evolution? How can any materialistassert with such confidence, as is done by Rossmassler, that \"this eternal conformity in the essence of phenomena renders it certainthat fire and water possessed at all times the same powers and ever will possess them?\" Who are they \"that darken counsel with wordswithout knowledge,\" and where were the Huxleys and Buchners when the foundations of the earth were laid by the great Law? It is afundamental principle of the Occult philosophy, this same homogeneity of matter and immutability of natural laws, which are somuch insisted upon by materialism; but that unity rests upon the inseparability of Spirit from matter, and, if the two are once divorced,the whole Kosmos would fall back into chaos and non-being. Therefore, it is absolutely false, and but an additional demonstration ofthe great conceit of our age, to assert (as men of science do) that all the great geological changes and terrible convulsions have beenproduced by ordinary and known physical forces. For these forces were but the tools and final means for the accomplishment of certainpurposes, acting periodically, and apparently mechanically, through an inward impulse mixed up with, but beyond their materialnature. There is a purpose in every important act of Nature, whose acts are all cyclic and periodical. But spiritual Forces having beenusually confused with the purely physical, the former are denied by, and therefore, have to remain unknown to Science, because leftunexamined.*\"The history of the World begins with its general aim,\" says Hegel; \"the realization of the Idea of Spirit -- only in an implicit form (ansich), that is, as Nature; a hidden, most profoundly hidden unconscious instinct, and the whole process of History . . . is directed torendering this unconscious impulse a conscious one. Thus appearing in the form of merely natural existence, natural will -- that whichhas been called the subjective side -- physical craving, instinct, passion, private interest, as also opinion and subjective conception --spontaneously present themselves at the very commencement. This vast congeries of volitions, interests and activities constitute theinstruments and means of the WORLD[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Men of science will say: We deny, because nothing of the kind has ever come within the scope of our experience. But, as argued byCharles Richet, the physiologist: \"So be it, but have you at least demonstrated the contrary? . . .

And this aim is none other than finding itself -- coming toitself -- and contemplating itself in concrete actuality. But that those manifestations of vitality on the part of individuals and peoples,in which they seek and satisfy their own purposes, are at the same time the means and instruments of a higher power, of a higher andbroader purpose of which they know nothing -- which they realise unconsciously -- might be made a matter of question; rather hasbeen questioned . . . on this point I announced my view at the very outset, and asserted our hypothesis . . . and our belief that Reasongoverns the World and has consequently governed its history. In relation to this independently universal and substantial existence --all else is subordinate, subservient to it, and the means for its development.\"*No metaphysician or theosophist could demur to these truths, which are all embodied in esoteric teachings. There is a predestinationin the geological life of our globe, as in the history, past and future, of races and nations. This is closely connected with what we callKarma and Western Pantheists, \"Nemesis\" and \"Cycles.\" The law of evolution is now carrying us along the ascending arc of our cycle,when the effects will be once more re-merged into, and re-become the (now neutralized) causes, and all things affected by the formerwill have regained their original harmony. This will be the cycle of our special \"Round,\" a moment in the duration of the great cycle,or the Mahayuga.The fine philosophical remarks of Hegel are found to have their application in the teachings of Occult Science, which shows natureever acting with a given purpose, whose results are always dual. This was stated in our first Occult volumes, in Isis Unveiled, p. 268,Vol. II., in the following words:--As our planet revolves once every year around the sun, and at the same time turns once in every twenty-four hours upon its own axis,thus traversing minor circles within a larger one, so is the work of the smaller cyclic periods accomplished and recommenced, withinthe Great Saros.The revolution of the physical world, according to the ancient doctrine, is attended by a like revolution in the world of intellect -- thespiritual evolution of the world proceeding in cycles, like the physical one.Thus we see in history a regular alternation of ebb and flow in the tide of human progress. The great kingdoms and empires of theworld, after reaching the culmination of their greatness, descend again, in accordance with the same law by which they ascended; till,having reached the lowest point, humanity reasserts itself and mounts up once more, the height of its attainment being, by this law ofascending progression by cycles, somewhat higher than the point from which it had before descended.But these cycles -- wheels within wheels, so comprehensively and ingeniously symbolized by the various Manus and Rishis in India,and by the Kabiri in the West** -- do not affect all mankind at one and the same"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"On World History\" in \"Philosophy of History,\" p. 26.

Hence, as we see, the difficulty of comprehending, anddiscriminating between them, with regard to their physical and spiritual effects, without having thoroughly mastered their relationswith, and action upon the respective positions of nations and races, in their destiny and evolution. This system cannot becomprehended if the spiritual action of these periods -- pre-ordained, so to say, by Karmic law --is separated from their physical course.The calculations of the best astrologers would fail, or at any rate remain imperfect, unless this dual action is thoroughly taken intoconsideration and dealt with upon these lines. And this mastery can be achieved only through INITIATION.The Grand Cycle includes the progress of mankind from the appearance of primordial man of ethereal form. It runs through the innercycles of his (man's) progressive evolution from the ethereal down to the semi-ethereal and purely physical: down to the redemption ofman from his coat of skin and matter, after which it continues running its course downward and then upward again, to meet at theculmination of a Round, when the manvantaric \"Serpent swallows its tail\" and seven minor cycles are passed. These are the greatRacial Cycles which affect equally all the nations and tribes included in that special Race; but there are minor and national as well astribal cycles within those, which run independently of each other. They are called in the Eastern esotericism the Karmic cycles. In theWest, since Pagan Wisdom has been repudiated as having grown from and been developed by the dark powers supposed to be atconstant war and in opposition to the little tribal Jehovah -- the full and awful significance of the Greek NEMESIS (or Karma) hasbeen entirely forgotten. Otherwise Christians would have better realized the profound truth that Nemesis is without attributes; thatwhile the dreaded goddess is absolute and immutable as a Principle, it is we ourselves -- nations and individuals -- who propel her toaction and give the impulse to its direction. KARMA-NEMESIS is the creator of nations and mortals, but once created, it is they whomake of her either a fury or a rewarding Angel. Yea --\"Wise are they who worship Nemesis\"*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] having ruled the earth once upon a time under the human form of actual living, thoughtruly divine and god-like man. The opinion of Colonel Vallancey (and also of Count de Gobelin) that the names of the Kabiri appearto be all allegorical, and to have signified no more (?) than an almanac of the vicissitudes of the seasons -- calculated for theoperations of agriculture\" (Collect. de Reb. Hibern., No. 13, Praef. Sect. 5) is as absurd as his assertion that OEon, Kronos, Saturn andDagon are all one, namely, the \"patriarch Adam.\" The Kabiri were the instructors of mankind in agriculture, because they were theregents over the seasons and Cosmic cycles. Hence it was they who regulated, as planetary Spirits or \"Angels\" (messengers), themysteries of the art of agriculture.* Who dread Karma-Nemesis would be better.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 643 KARMA-NEMESIS.-- as the chorus tells Prometheus. And as unwise they, who believe that the goddess may be propitiated by whatever sacrifices andprayers, or have her wheel diverted from the path it has once taken. \"The triform Fates and ever mindful Furies\" are her attributes onlyon earth, and begotten by ourselves. There is no return from the paths she cycles over; yet those paths are of our own making, for it iswe, collectively or individually, who prepare them. Karma-Nemesis is the synonym of PROVIDENCE, minus design, goodness, andevery other finite attribute and qualification, so unphilosophically attributed to the latter. An Occultist or a philosopher will not speakof the goodness or cruelty of Providence; but, identifying it with Karma-Nemesis, he will teach that nevertheless it guards the goodand watches over them in this, as in future lives; and that it punishes the evil-doer -- aye, even to his seventh rebirth. So long, in short,as the effect of his having thrown into perturbation even the smallest atom in the Infinite World of harmony, has not been finallyreadjusted. For the only decree of Karma -- an eternal and immutable decree -- is absolute Harmony in the world of matter as it is inthe world of Spirit. It is not, therefore, Karma that rewards or punishes, but it is we, who reward or punish ourselves according towhether we work with, through and along with nature, abiding by the laws on which that Harmony depends, or -- break them.Nor would the ways of Karma be inscrutable were men to work in union and harmony, instead of disunion and strife. For our ignoranceof those ways -- which one portion of mankind calls the ways of Providence, dark and intricate; while another sees in them the actionof blind Fatalism; and a third, simple chance, with neither gods nor devils to guide them -- would surely disappear, if we would butattribute all these to their correct cause. With right knowledge, or at any rate with a confident conviction that our neighbours will nomore work to hurt us than we would think of harming them, the two-thirds of the World's evil would vanish into thin air. Were no man tohurt his brother, Karma-Nemesis would have neither cause to work for, nor weapons to act through. It is the constant presence in ourmidst of every element of strife and opposition, and the division of races, nations, tribes, societies and individuals into Cains andAbels, wolves and lambs, that is the chief cause of the \"ways of Providence.\" We cut these numerous windings in our destinies dailywith our own hands, while we imagine that we are pursuing a track on the royal high road of respectability and duty, and then"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"complain of those ways being so intricate and so dark. We stand bewildered before the mystery of our own making, and the riddles oflife that we will not solve, and then accuse the great Sphinx of devouring us.

If one breaks the lawsof Harmony, or, as a theosophical writer expresses it, \"the laws of life,\" one must be prepared to fall into the chaos one has oneselfproduced. For, according to the same writer, \"the only conclusion one can come to is that these laws of life are their own avengers;and consequently that every avenging Angel is only a typified representation of their re-action.\"Therefore, if any one is helpless before these immutable laws, it is not ourselves, the artificers of our destinies, but rather those angels,the guardians of harmony. Karma-Nemesis is no more than the (spiritual) dynamical effect of causes produced and forces awakenedinto activity by our own actions. It is a law of occult dynamics that \"a given amount of energy expended on the spiritual or astral planeis productive of far greater results than the same amount expended on the physical objective plane of existence.\"This state will last till man's spiritual intuitions are fully opened, which will not happen before we fairly cast off our thick coats ofmatter; until we begin acting from within, instead of ever following impulses from without; namely, those produced by our physicalsenses and gross selfish body. Until then the only palliative to the evils of life is union and harmony -- a Brotherhood IN ACTU, andaltruism not simply in name. The suppression of one single bad cause will suppress not one, but a variety of bad effects. And if aBrotherhood or even a number of Brotherhoods may not be able to prevent nations from occasionally cutting each other's throats --still unity in thought and action, and philosophical research into the mysteries of being, will always prevent some, while trying tocomprehend that which has hitherto remained to them a riddle, from creating additional causes in a world already so full of woe andevil. Knowledge of Karma gives the conviction that if --\". . . . virtue in distress, and vice in triumphMake atheists of mankind,\"*it is only because that mankind has ever shut its eyes to the great truth that man is himself his own saviour as his own destroyer. Thathe need not accuse Heaven and the gods, Fates and Providence, of the apparent injustice that reigns in the midst of humanity.

The latter are inseparably blended with the destinies of nations and men. But in their purely physical sense, Europeknows of no other cycles than the astronomical, and makes its computations accordingly. Nor will it hear of any other than imaginarycircles or circuits in the starry heavens that gird them --\"With centric and eccentric scribbled o'erCycle and epicycle, orb in orb . . .\"But with the pagans, with whom, as Coleridge has it -- \". . . . . Time, cyclical time, was their abstraction of the Deity . .\" that \"Deity\"manifesting co-ordinately with, and only through Karma, and being that KARMA-NEMESIS itself, the cycles meant something morethan a mere succession of events, or a periodical space of time of more or less prolonged duration. For they were generally markedwith recurrences of a more varied and intellectual character than are exhibited in the periodical return of seasons or of certainconstellations. Modern wisdom is satisfied with astronomical computations and prophecies based on unerring mathematical laws.Ancient Wisdom added to the cold shell of astronomy the vivifying elements of its soul and spirit -- ASTROLOGY. And, as the siderealmotions do regulate and determine other events on Earth -- besides potatoes and the periodical disease of that useful vegetable -- (astatement which, not being amenable to scientific explanation, is merely derided, while accepted) -- those events have to be allowedto find themselves predetermined by even simple astronomical computations.

Sidereal heaven is before them; andthough their spiritual vision is still unopened and the atmospheric dust of terrestrial origin seals their sight and chains it to the limits ofphysical systems, still they do not fail to perceive the movements and note the behaviour of meteors and comets. They record theperiodical advents of those wanderers and \"flaming messengers,\" and prophesy, in consequence, earthquakes, meteoric showers, theapparition of certain stars, comets, etc., etc. Are they soothsayers for all that? No, they are learned astronomers.Why, then, should occultists and astrologers, as learned, be disbelieved, when they prophesy the return of some cyclic event on thesame mathematical principle? Why should the claim that they know it be ridiculed? Their forefathers and predecessors, havingrecorded the recurrence of such events in their time and day, throughout a period embracing hundreds of thousands of years, theconjunction of the same constellations must necessarily produce, if not quite the same, at any rate, similar effects. Are the propheciesderided, because of the claim of the hundreds of thousands of years of observation, and the millions of years of the human races? Inits turn modern Science is laughed at for its far more modest geological and anthropological figures, by those who hold to Biblicalchronology. Thus Karma adjusts even human laughter at the mutual expense of sects, learned societies, and individuals. Yet in theprognostication of such future events, at any rate, all foretold on the authority of cyclic recurrences, there is no psychic phenomenoninvolved. It is neither prevision, nor prophecy; no more than is the signalling of a comet or star, several years before its appearance. Itis simply knowledge and mathematically correct computations which enable the WISE MEN OF THE EAST to foretell, for instance,that England is on the eve of such or another catastrophe; France, nearing such a point of her cycle, and Europe in generalthreatened with, or rather, on the eve of, a cataclysm, which her own cycle of racial Karma has led her to. The reliability of theinformation depends, of course, on the acceptation or rejection of the claim for a tremendous period of historical observation. EasternInitiates maintain that they have preserved records of the racial development and of events of universal import ever since thebeginning of the Fourth Race -- that which preceded being traditional.

But in the present case no such metaphysicalbelief is claimed as our chief dependence, but a proof is given on what, to every Occultist, is quite scientific evidence -- the recordspreserved through the Zodiac for incalculable ages.It is now amply proved that even horoscopes and judiciary astrology are not quite based on a fiction, and that stars and constellations,consequently, have an occult and mysterious influence on, and connection with, individuals. And if with the latter, why not withnations, races, and mankind in bulk? This, again, is a claim made on the authority of the Zodiacal records. We shall examine then, ifyou please, how far the Zodiac was known to the ancients, and how far it is forgotten by the moderns.-------XVII.\"THE ZODIAC AND ITS ANTIQUITY.\"\"ALL men are apt to have a high conceit of their own understanding, and to be tenacious of the opinions they profess,\" said Jordan,justly adding to this -- \"and yet almost all men are guided by the understandings of others, not by their own; and may be said moretruly to adopt, than to beget, their opinions.\""},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"This becomes doubly true in the matter of scientific opinions upon hypotheses offered for consideration -- the prejudice andpreconceptions of \"authorities,\" so called, often deciding upon questions of the most vital importance for history. There are severalsuch predetermined opinions among our learned Orientalists, yet few are more unjust or illogical than the general error with regard tothe antiquity of the Zodiac. Thanks to the hobby of some German Orientalists, English and American Sanskritists have acceptedProfessor Weber's opinion that the peoples of India had no idea or knowledge of the Zodiac prior to the Macedonian invasion, andthat it is from the Greeks that the ancient Hindus imported it into their country. We are further told, by several other \"authorities,\" thatno Eastern nation knew of the Zodiac before the Hellenes kindly acquainted their neighbours with their invention. This, in the face ofthe Book of Job, declared, even by themselves, to be the oldest in the Hebrew canon, certainly prior to Moses, and which speaks ofthe making \"of Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades (Ash, Kesil, and------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 648 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Cimah) and the chambers of the South\" (ix. 9); of Scorpio and the Mazzaroths -- the TWELVE SIGNS (xxxviii., 31, 32), which words, ifthey mean anything, imply knowledge of the Zodiac even among the nomadic Arabic tribes. The Book of Job, they say, precedesHomer and Hesiod by at least one thousand years -- the two Greek poets having themselves flourished some eight centuries before theChristian era (!!). One who prefers, by the bye, to believe Plato, who shows Homer flourishing far earlier, could point to a number ofZodiacal signs mentioned in the Iliad and the Odyssey, in the Orphic poems, and elsewhere. But since the cock-and-bull hypothesis ofsome modern critics to the effect that neither Orpheus, nor yet Homer and Hesiod, ever existed, it would seem time lost to mentionthese Archaic authors at all. The Arabian Job will suffice; unless, indeed, his volume of lamentations, along with the poems of the twoGreeks, adding to them those of Linus, should now be also declared to be the patriotic forgery of the Jew Aristobulus. But if the Zodiacwas known in the days of Job, how could the civilized and philosophical Hindus have remained ignorant of it?Risking the arrows of modern criticism -- rather blunted by misuse -- the reader may be made acquainted with Bailly's learned opinionupon the subject. Inferred speculations may be shown to be erroneous. Mathematical calculations stand on more secure grounds.Taking as a starting point several astronomical references in Job, Bailly devised a very ingenious means of proving that the earliestfounders of the science of the Zodiac belonged to an antediluvian, primitive people. The fact that he seems willing to see in Thoth,Seth, and in Fohi (of China), some of the Biblical patriarchs, does not interfere with the validity of his proof as to the antiquity of theZodiac.* Even accepting, for argument's sake, his cautious 3700 years B.C. as the correct age of the science, this date proves in themost irrefutable way that it was not the Greeks who invented the Zodiac, for the simple reason that they did not yet exist as a nationthirty-seven centuries B.C. -- not as an historical race admitted by the critics, at any rate. Bailly then calculated the period at which theconstellations manifested the atmospheric influence called by Job \"sweet influences of the Pleiades\"** (in Hebrew, Chimah, see Jobxxxviii. 31); of the Cesil (Orion); and that of the desert rains with reference to Scorpio, the eighth constellation; and found that inpresence the eternal conformity of those divisions of the zodiac and names of the planets applied in the same order everywhere andalways; and in presence of the impossibility of attributing it all to chance and coincidence,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Astronomie Antique.** The Pleiades, as all know, are the seven stars beyond the Bull, which appear at the beginning of spring.

(See Astronomie Antique, pp.63 to 74.)Again, if the Bible is supposed to be an authority on any matter (and there are some who still believe so, whether from Christian orKabalistical considerations), then the zodiac is clearly mentioned in II Kings, xxiii. 5. Before the \"book of the law\" was \"found\" byHilkiah, the high priest (xxii.), the signs of the zodiac were known and worshipped. They were held in the same adoration as the sunand moon, since the \"priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense . . . unto Baal, to the sun, moon, and to theplanets, and to all the host of heaven,\" or the twelve signs or constellations, as the marginal note in the English Bible explains (see II.Kings xxiii. 5), had followed the injunction for centuries. They were stopped in their idolatry only by King Josiah, 624 years B.C.The Old Testament is full of allusions to the twelve zodiacal signs, and the whole scheme is built upon it -- heroes, personages, andevents. Thus in the dream of Joseph, who saw eleven \"stars\" bowing to the twelfth, which was his \"star,\" the zodiac is meant. TheRoman Catholics have discovered in it, moreover, a prophecy of Christ, who is that twelfth star, they say, and the eleven apostles; theabsence of the twelfth being also regarded as a prophetic allusion to the treachery of Judas. The twelve sons of Jacob are again areference to the same, as justly pointed out by Villapandus (Temple de Jerusalem, Vol. II., p. 2nd part, chap. xxx). Sir JamesMalcolm, in his History of Persia (ch. vii.), shows the Dabistan echoing all such traditions about the Zodiac. He traces the invention ofit to the palmy days of the golden age of Iran, remarking that one of the said traditions maintains that the genii of the planets arerepresented under the same shapes and figures they had assumed, when they showed themselves to several holy prophets, and havethus led to the establishment of the rites based on the Zodiac.Pythagoras, and after him Philo Judaeus, held the number 12 as very sacred. \"The dodecahedron is a PERFECT number.\" It is theone among the signs of the Zodiac, Philo adds, that the sun visits in twelve months, and it is to honour that sign that Moses divided"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"his nation into twelve tribes, established the twelve cakes (Levit. xxiv., 5) of the shewbread, and placed twelve precious stones aroundthe ephod of the pontiffs.

Itcomes at every renewal of the cycle of the sidereal year of 25,868 years. The names of the Akkadian months were called by, andderived from, the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 650 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.names of the signs of the Zodiac, and the Akkadians themselves are far earlier than the Chaldaeans. Mr. Proctor shows, in his Mythsand Marvels of Astronomy, that the ancient astronomers had acquired a system of the most accurate astronomy 2,400 years B.C.; theHindus date their Kali Yug from a great periodical conjunction of the planets thirty-one centuries B.C.; and, withal, it is the Greeksbelonging to the expedition of Alexander the Great, who were the instructors of the Aryan Hindus in astronomy!Whether the origin of the Zodiac is Aryan or Egyptian, it is still of an immense antiquity. Simplicius (VIth cent. A.D.) writes that he hadalways heard that the Egyptians had kept astronomical observations and records for the last 630,000 years. This statement appears tofrighten Mr. G. Massey, who remarks on this in his Natural Genesis (318) that \"if we read this number of years by the month whichEuxodus said the Egyptians termed a year, that would still yield the length of two cycles of precession (or 51,736 years).\" DiogenesLaertius carried back the astronomical calculations of the Egyptians to 48,863 years before Alexander the Great (Proem, 2). MartianusCapella corroborates the same by telling posterity that the Egyptians had secretly studied astronomy for over 40,000 years, before theyimparted their knowledge to the world (Astronomy of the Ancients, Lewis, p. 264).Several valuable quotations are made in the Natural Genesis with the view of supporting the author's theories, but they justify theteaching of the Secret Doctrine far more. For instance, Plutarch is quoted from his Life of Sulla, saying: \"One day when the sky wasserene . . . a sound was heard in it . . . of a trumpet, so loud, shrill and mournful, that it affrighted . . . the world. The Tuscan sagessaid that it portended a new race of men, and a renovation of the world; for they affirmed that there were eight several kinds of men,all being different in life and manners, and that Heaven had allotted each its time, which was limited by the circuit of the great year\"(25,868 years).This reminds one strongly of our seven races of men, and of the eighth -- the \"animal man\" -- descended from the later Third Race; asalso of the successive submersions and destruction of the continents which finally disposed of almost the entire bulk of that race.\"The Assyrians,\" says Iamblichus, \"have not only preserved the memorials of seven and twenty myriads of years (270,000 years) asHipparchus says they have, but likewise of the whole apocatastases and periods of the seven rulers of the world.\" (Proclus, in Timaeus,b. I.) This is the calculation of the Esoteric Doctrine, as approximately as it can be. For 1,000,000 of years are allowed for our presentRoot-race (the Fifth), and about 850,000 years since the submersion of the last large island (part of the Continent), the Ruta of theFourth Race, or the Atlanteans;------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 651 THE JEWISH PATRIARCHS ZODIACAL SIGNS.while Daitya, a small island inhabited by a mixed race, was destroyed about 270,000 years ago, during the glacial period orthereabouts (vide Book II.). But the Seven Rulers, or the seven great Dynasties of the divine kings belong to the traditions of everygreat people of antiquity. Wherever twelve are mentioned, these are invariably the 12 signs of the zodiac.So patent is the fact, that the Roman Catholic writers -- especially among the French Ultramontanes -- have tacitly agreed to connectthe twelve Jewish Patriarchs with the signs of the Zodiac. This is done in a kind of prophetico-mystic way, which would sound to piousand ignorant ears like a portentous sign, a tacit divine recognition of the \"chosen people of God,\" whose finger has purposely tracedin heaven, from the beginning of creation, the numbers of these patriarchs. For instance, these writers (De Mirville among others)recognise curiously enough all the characteristics of the 12 signs of the Zodiac, in the words addressed by the dying Jacob to his Sons,and in his definitions of the future of each Tribe. (Vide Genesis, ch. xlix.) Moreover, the respective banners of the same tribes areclaimed to have exhibited the same symbols and the same names as the signs, repeated in the 12 stones of the Urim and Thummim,and on the 12 wings of the cherub. Leaving the proof of exactitude in the alleged correspondence to the said mystics, it is as follows:Man, or the Aquarius, is in the sphere of Reuben, who is declared as \"unstable as water\" (the Vulgate has it, to be \"rushing likewater,\"; Gemini, in the strong fraternal association of Simeon and Levi; Leo, in that of Judah, \"the strong Lion\" of his tribe, \"the lion'swhelp\"; the Pisces, in Zabulon, who \"shall dwell at the haven of the sea\"; Taurus, in Issachar, because he is \"a strong ass couchingdown,\" etc., and therefore associated with the stables; Virgo-Scorpio, in Dan, who is described as \"a serpent, an adder in the path thatbiteth,\" etc.; Capricornus in Naphtali, who is \"a hind (a deer) let loose\"; Cancer, in Benjamin, for he is \"ravenous\"; Libra, the\"Balance,\" in Asher, whose \"bread shall be fat\"; Saggitarius in Joseph, because \"his bow abode in strength.\" To make up for thetwelfth sign, Virgo, made independent of Scorpio, is Dina, the only daughter of Jacob. (See Genesis xlix.) Tradition shows the allegedtribes carrying the 12 signs on their banners. But the Bible is, besides these, full of theo-cosmological and astronomical symbols andpersonifications.It remains to wonder, and query -- if the actual, living Patriarch's destiny was so indissolubly wound up with the Zodiac -- how it is thatafter the loss of the ten tribes, ten signs out of the twelve have not also miraculously disappeared from the sidereal fields? But this isof no great concern. Let us rather busy ourselves with the history of the Zodiac itself."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 652 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Now the reader may be reminded of some opinions expressed on the subject by several of the highest authorities in Science.Newton believed the invention of the Zodiac could be traced as far back as the expedition of the Argonauts; and Dulaure fixed itsorigin at 6,500 years B.C., just 2,496 years before the creation of the World according to the Bible chronology.Creuzer believes it very easy to show that most of the theogonies are intimately connected with religious calendars, and point to theZodiac as their prime origin -- if not identical with the Zodiac known to us now, then something very analogous to it. He feels certainthat the Zodiac and its mystic relations are at the bottom of all the mythologies, under one form or the other, and that it had existed inthe old form for ages before; owing to some singular co-ordination of events, it was brought out in the present defined astronomicalgarb. (Creuzer, Book III., page 930.)Whether \"the genii of the planets\" (our Dhyan Chohans of supra-mundane spheres) showed themselves to \"holy prophets\" or not, asclaimed in the Dabistan, it would seem that great laymen and warriors were favoured in the same way in days of old, whenastrological magic and theophania went hand in hand in Chaldea. For Xenophon, no ordinary man, narrates of Cyrus, that at themoment of his death that king was giving ardent thanks to gods and heroes, for having so often instructed him themselves about thesigns in heaven, [[ev ouraniois semeiois]] (Cyropedie, \"Ant. du Zodiaque.\")Unless the science of the zodiac is supposed to be of the highest antiquity and universality, how account for its signs being traced inthe oldest theogonies? Laplace is said to have felt struck with amazement at the idea of the days of Mercury (Wednesday), Venus(Friday), Jupiter (Thursday), Saturn (Saturday), and others being related to the days of the week in the same order and with the samenames in India as in Northern Europe. \"Try, if you can, with the present system of autochthonous civilizations, so much in fashion inour day, to explain how nations with no ancestry, no traditions or birthplace in common, could have succeeded in inventing a kind ofcelestial phantasmagoria, a veritable imbroglio of sidereal denominations, without sequence or object, having no figurative relationwith the constellations they represent, and still less, apparently, with the phases of our terrestrial life they are made to signify,\" hadthere not been a general intention and a universal cause and belief, at the root of all this? (Pneumatologie, Vol. IV., p. 61.) Mosttruly has Dupuis asserted the same: \"Il est impossible de decouvrir le moindre trait de ressemblance entre les parties du ciel et lesfigures que les astronomes y ont arbitrairement tracees, et de l'autre cote; le hazard est impossible,\" he says. (Origine des Cultes,\"Zodiaque.\")------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 653 THE SIGN OF JONAS.Most certainly chance is \"impossible.\" There is no \"chance\" in Nature, wherein everything is mathematically co-ordinate and mutuallyrelated in its units. \"Chance,\" says Coleridge, \"is but the pseudonym of God (or Nature), for those particular cases which He does notchoose to subscribe openly with His sign manual.\" Replace the word \"God\" by that of Karma and it will become an Eastern axiom.Therefore, the sidereal \"prophecies\" of the zodiac, as they are called by Christian mystics, never point to any one particular event,however solemn and sacred it may be for some one portion of humanity, but to ever-recurrent, periodical laws in nature, understoodbut by the Initiates of the sidereal gods themselves.No occultist, no astrologer of Eastern birth, will ever agree with Christian mystics, or even with Kepler's mystical astronomy, his greatscience and erudition notwithstanding; simply because, if his premises are quite correct, his deductions therefrom are one-sided andbiassed by Christian preconceptions. Where the latter finds a prophecy directly pointing at the Saviour, other nations see a symbol ofan eternal law decreed for the actual manvantara. Why see in the Pisces a direct reference to Christ -- one of the several world-reformers, a Saviour but for his direct followers, but only a great and glorious Initiate for all the rest -- when that constellation shines asa symbol of all the past, present, and future Spiritual Saviours who dispense light and dispel mental darkness? Christian symbologistshave tried to prove that it was that of Ephraim (Joseph's son), the elect of Jacob, that therefore, it was at the moment of the Sunentering into the sign of the Fish (Pisces) that \"the Elect Messiah, the [[Ichthus]] of the first Christians, had to be born. But, if Jesus ofNazareth was that Messiah -- was he really born at that \"moment,\" or was he made to be so born by the adaptation of theologians,who sought only to make their preconceived ideas fit in with sidereal facts and popular belief? Everyone knows that the real time andyear of the birth of Jesus are totally unknown. And it is the Jews, whose forefathers have made the word Dag signify both \"fish\" and\"Messiah,\" who, during the forced development of their rabbinical language, are the first to deny this Christian claim. And what of thefurther facts that Brahmins also connect their \"Messiah,\" the eternal Avatar Vishnu, with a fish and the Deluge, and that theBabylonians made of their Dag-On, equally a fish and a Messiah, the Man-Fish and Prophet?There are those learned iconoclasts among Egyptologists, who say that \"when the Pharisees sought a 'sign from heaven' Jesus said,'there shall no sign be given but the sign of Jonas' (Mat. xvi. 4). . . . . The sign of Jonas is that of the Oan or fishman of Nineveh. . . . .Assuredly there was no other sign than that of the Sun reborn in Pisces.

It was Wilford who had recognized Noah in Prithee and in Satyavrata, Enos inDhruva, and even Assur in Iswara. Yet, after being residents for so many years in India, some Orientalists, at least, ought to haveknown that it was not the Hindus alone who had these figures, or who had divided their great age into four minor ages. Neverthelesswriters in the Asiatic Researches indulged in the most extravagant speculations.\"Christian theologians think it their duty to write against the long periods of Hindu chronology,\" argues very pertinently S. A. Mackey,the Norwich \"philosopher, astronomer, and shoemaker.\" \"But when a man of learning crucifies the names and numbers of theancients, and wrings and twists them into a form which means something quite foreign to the intention of the ancient authors; butwhich, so mutilated, fits in with the birth of some maggot pre-existing in his own brain with so much exactness that he pretends to beamazed at the discovery, I cannot think him quite so pardonable\" (Key of Urania).This is intended to apply to Captain (later Colonel) Wilford, but the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Whether many nations have seen that identical star, or not, we all know that the sepulchres of \"the three Magi,\" who rejoice in thequite Teutonic names of Kaspar and Melchior, Balthazar being the only exception, and the two having little of the Chaldean ring inthem -- are shown by the priests in the famous cathedral of Cologne, where the Magian bodies are not only supposed, but firmlybelieved to have been buried.** This tradition about the seventy planets that preside over the destinies of nations, is based on the occult cosmogonical teachingthat besides our own septenary chain of world-planets, there are many more in the solar system.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 655 CHALDEO-JUDEAN GODS.words may fit more than one of our modern Orientalists. The former was the first to crown his unlucky speculations in Hindu chronologyand the Puranas by connecting the 4,320,000 years with biblical chronology, simply dwarfing the figures to 4,320 years (the supposedlunar year of the Nativity), and Dr. Sepp has simply plagiarized the idea from this gallant officer. Moreover, he persisted in seeing inthem Jewish property, as well as a Christian prophecy, thus accusing the Aryans of having helped themselves to Semitic revelation,whereas it was the reverse. The Jews, moreover, need not be accused of despoiling the Hindus, of whose figures Ezra probably knewnothing. They had evidently and undeniably borrowed them from the Chaldeans, along with their gods. Of the 432,000 years of theChaldean divine Dynasties* they made 4,320 lunar years from the world's creation to the Christian era; as to the Babylonian andEgyptian Gods, they transformed them as quietly and modestly into Patriarchs. Every nation was more or less guilty of suchrefashioning and adaptation of a Pantheon (common once to all) of universal, into national, tribal gods and Heroes. It was theirproperty in its new Pentateuchal garb, and no one of the Israelites has ever forced it upon any other nation -- least of all uponEuropeans.Without stopping to notice this very unscientific chronology more than is necessary, we may make a few remarks that may be found tothe point. These figures of 4,320 lunar years of the world (in the Bible the solar years are used) are not fanciful, as such, even if theirapplication is quite erroneous; for they are only the distorted echo of the primitive esoteric, and later on Brahminical doctrineconcerning the Yugas. A \"Day\" of Brahma equals 4,320,000,000 years, as also a \"Night\" of Brahma, or the duration of Pralaya, afterwhich a new SUN rises trium-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Every scholar is aware, of course, that the Chaldeans claimed the same figures (432) or (432,000) for their divine dynasties as theHindus do for their Mahayuga, namely, 4,320,000. Therefore has Dr. Sepp, of Munich, undertaken to support Kepler and Wilford intheir charge that the Hindus had borrowed them from the Christians, and the Chaldeans from the Jews, who, as claimed, expectedtheir Messiah in the lunar year of the world 4,320!!! As these figures, according to ancient writers, were based by Berosus on the 120Saroses -- each of the divisions meaning six neroses of 600 years each, making a sum total of 432,000 years -- they do not thus appearperemptory. But the pious professor of Munich undertook to explain them in the correct way. He claims to have solved the riddle byshowing that \"the saros being composed according to Pliny of 222 synodial months, to wit, 18 years 6/10,\" the calculator naturally fellback into the figures \"given by Suidas,\" who affirmed that the 120 saroses made 2,222 sacerdotal and cyclic years, which equalled1,656 solar years.\" (Vie de Notre Seigneur Jesus Christ, Vol. II., p. 417.)Suidas said nothing of the kind, and, if he had, he would prove little, if anything, by it. The neroses and saroses were the same thornin the side of uninitiated ancient writers, as the apocalyptic 666 of the \"great Beast\" is in that of the modern, and they have foundtheir unlucky Newtons as the latter figures have."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 656 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.phantly over a new manvantara, for the septenary chain it illuminates. The teaching had penetrated into Palestine and Europecenturies before the Christian era (see Isis Unveiled II. 132), and was present in the minds of the Mosaic Jews, who based upon it theirsmall cycle, though it received full expression only through the Christian chronologers of the Bible, who adopted it, as also the 25th ofDecember, the day on which all the solar gods were said to have been incarnated. What wonder, then, that the Messiah was made tobe born \"the lunar year of the world 4,320?\" The \"Son of Righteousness and Salvation\" had once more arisen and had dispelledpralayic darkness of chaos and non-being on the plane of our objective little globe and chain. Once the subject of the adoration wassettled upon, it was easy to make the supposed events of his birth, life, and death, fit in with the Zodiacal exigencies and oldtraditions, though they had to be somewhat remodelled for the occasion.Thus what Kepler said, as a great astronomer, becomes comprehensible. He recognised the grand and universal importance of allsuch planetary conjunctions, \"each of which\" -- as he has well said -- \"is a climacteric year of Humanity.\"* The rare conjunction ofSaturn, Jupiter, and Mars has its significance and importance on account of its certain great results -- in India and China as much as ithas in Europe for the respective mystics of all those countries. And it is certainly no better now than a mere assumption to maintainthat nature had only Christ in view, when building her (to the profane) fantastic and meaningless constellations. If it is claimed that itwas no hazard that could lead the archaic architects of the Zodiac, thousands of years ago, to mark with the asterisk (a) the figure ofTaurus, with no better or more valid proof of it being prophetic of the Verbum or Christ than that the aleph of Taurus means \"theONE\" and the FIRST, and that Christ was also the alpha or the ONE, then this \"proof\" may be shown strangely invalidated in morethan one way. To begin with, the Zodiac existed before the Christian era, at all events; further, all the Sun-gods had been mysticallyconnected with that constellation (Taurus) -- Osiris, for instance -- and were all called by their respective votaries \"the First.\" Then thecompilers of the mystical epithets given to the Christian Saviour, were all more or less acquainted with[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The reader has to bear in mind that the phrase \"climacteric year\" has more than the usual significance, when used by Occultists andMystics. It is not only a critical period, during which some great change is periodically expected, whether in human or cosmicconstitution, but it likewise pertains to spiritual universal changes. The Europeans called every 63rd year \"the grand climacteric,\" andperhaps justly supposed those years to be the years produced by multiplying 7 into the odd numbers 3, 5, 7 and 9. But seven is thereal scale of nature, in Occultism, and 7 has to be multiplied in quite a different way and method, unknown as yet to Europeannations.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 657 THE DRAGON AND THE BULL.the significance of the Zodiacal signs; and it is easier to suppose that they should have arranged their claims so as to answer themystic signs, than that the latter should have shone as a prophecy for one portion of humanity, for millions of years, taking no heed ofthe numberless generations that had gone before, and those to be born hereafter.\"It is not simple chance,\" we are told, \"that has placed in certain spheres, on a throne, the head of that bull (Taurus), trying to pushaway with the ansated cross on its horns, a Dragon; the more so, since this constellation of Taurus was called 'the great city of Godand the mother of revelations,' and also 'the interpreter of the divine voice,' the Apis pacis of Hermoutis, in Egypt, which (as thepatristic fathers would assure the world) preferred oracles that related to the birth of the Saviour\" (Pneumatologie, iv., 71).To this theological assumption there are several answers. Firstly, the ansated Egyptian cross, or tau, the Jaina cross, or Swastica, andthe Christian cross have all the same meaning. Secondly, no peoples or nations except the Christians gave the significance to theDragon that is given to it now. The serpent was the symbol of WISDOM; and the Bull (Taurus) the symbol of physical or terrestrialgeneration. Thus the latter, pushing off the Dragon, or spiritual, Divine Wisdom, with the Tau, or Cross -- which is esoterically \"thefoundation and framework of all construction\" -- would have an entirely phallic, physiological meaning, had it not still anothersignificance unknown to our Biblical scholars and symbologists. At any rate, it shows no special reference to the Verbum of St. John,except, perhaps, in a general sense. The taurus (which, by the way, is no lamb, but a bull) was sacred in every Cosmogony, with theHindus as with the Zoroastrians, with the Chaldees as with the Egyptians. So much, every schoolboy knows.It may perhaps help to refresh the memory of our Theosophists by referring them to what was said of the Virgin and the Dragon, andthe universality of periodical births and re-births of World-Saviours -- solar gods -- in Isis, II., 490, with reference to certain passages inRevelations.In 1853, the savant known as Erard-Mollien read before the Institute of France a paper tending to prove the antiquity of the IndianZodiac, in the signs of which were found the root and philosophy of all the most important religious festivals of that country, the originof which religious ceremonies goes back into the night of time at least 3,000 B.C., as the lecturer tried to demonstrate. The Zodiac ofthe Hindus, he thought, was far anterior to the Zodiac of the Greeks, and differed from it in some particulars vastly. In it one sees theDragon on a tree, at the foot of which the \"Virgin,\" Kanya-Durga, one of the most ancient goddesses, is placed on a lion draggingafter him the solar car. \"This is the reason why,\" he added, \"this Virgin Durga is not the simple memento of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 658 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"an astronomical fact, but verily the most ancient divinity of the Indian Olympus. She is evidently the same of whom all the Sibyllinebooks spoke, those works that have been the source of the inspiration of Virgil; the virgin whose return was prophesied as a sign ofuniversal renovation. . . . . And why,\" he added, \"when we see to this day, the months named after the deity-names of this solarZodiac by the Malayalim-speaking people of southern India -- why should that people have abandoned their ancestral Zodiac toburden themselves with that of the Greeks? Everything proves, on the contrary, that these zodiacal figures have been transmitted tothe Greeks by the Chaldees, who got them from the Brahmans.\" (See Recueil de l'Academie des Inscriptions, 1853.)But all this is very poor testimony. Let us remember, however, also that which was said and accepted by the contemporaries of Volney,who, in his \"Ruins of Empires,\" p. 360, remarks that as Aries was in its fifteenth degree 1447 B.C., it follows that the first degree of\"Libra\" could not have coincided with the Vernal equinox more lately than 15,194 years B.C., to which, if you add 1,790 years sinceChrist, it appears that 16,984 years have elapsed since the origin of the Zodiac.Dr. Schlegel, moreover, in his Uranographie Chinoise assigns to the Chinese Astronomical Sphere an antiquity of 18,000 years. (Videpp. 54, 196, et seq.)Nevertheless, as opinions quoted without adequate proofs are of little avail, it may be more useful to turn to scientific evidence. M.Bailly, the famous French astronomer of the last century, Member of the Academy, etc., etc., asserts that the Hindu systems ofastronomy are by far the oldest, and that from them the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and even the Jews derived their knowledge. Insupport of these views he says --\"The astronomers who preceded the epoch 1,491 are, first, the Alexandrian Greeks; Hipparchus, who flourished 125 years before ourera, and Ptolemy, 260 years after Hipparchus. Following these were the Arabs, who revived the study of astronomy in the ninthcentury. These were succeeded by the Persians and the Tartars, to whom we owe the tables of Massireddin in 1269, and those ofUlug-beg in 1437. Such is the succession of events in Asia as known prior to the Indian epoch 1491. What, then, is an epoch? It is theobservation of the longitude of a star at a given moment, the place in the sky where it was seen, and which serves as a point ofreference, a starting-point from which to calculate both the past and future positions of the star from its observed motion. But an epochis useless unless the motion of the star has been determined. A people, new to science and obliged to borrow a foreign astronomy,finds no difficulty in fixing an epoch, since------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 659 BAILLY'S CONCLUSIONS.the only observation needed is one which can be made at any moment. But what it needs above all, what it is obliged to borrow, arethose elements which depend on accurate determination, and which require continuous observation; above all, those motions whichdepend on time, and which can only be accurately determined by centuries of observation. These motions, then, must be borrowedfrom a nation which has made such observations, and has behind it the labours of centuries. We conclude, therefore, that a newpeople will not borrow the epochs of an ancient one, without also borrowing from them the 'average motions.' Starting from thisprinciple we shall find that the Hindu epochs 1491 and 3102 could not have been derived from those of either Ptolemy or Ulug-beg.\"There remains the supposition that the Hindus, comparing their observations in 1491 with those previously made by Ulug-beg andPtolemy, used the intervals between these observations to determine the \"average motions.\" The date of Ulug-beg is too recent forsuch a determination; while those of Ptolemy and Hipparchus were barely remote enough. But if the Hindu motions had beendetermined from these comparisons, the epochs would be connected together. Starting from the epochs of Ulug-beg and Ptolemy weshould arrive at all those of the Hindus. But this is not the case. Hence foreign epochs were either unknown or useless to the Hindus.*We may add to this another important consideration. When a nation is obliged to borrow from its neighbours the methods or theaverage motions of its astronomical tables, it has even greater need to borrow, besides these, the knowledge of the inequalities of themotions of the heavenly bodies, the motions of the apogee, of the nodes, and of the inclination of the ecliptic; in short, all thoseelements the determination of which requires the art of observing, some instrumental appliances, and great industry. All theseastronomical elements, differing more or less with the Greeks of Alexandria, the Arabs, the Persians and the Tartars, exhibit noresemblance whatever with those of the Hindus. The latter, therefore, borrowed nothing from their neighbours.Condensing Bailly's remarks, he comes to the following conclusions:--If the Hindus did not borrow their epoch, they must have possessed a real one of their own, based on their own observations; and thismust be either the epoch of the year 1491 after, or that of the year 3102 before our era, the latter preceding by 4592 years the epoch1491. We have to choose between these two epochs and to decide which of them is based on observation. But before stating thearguments which can and must[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For a detailed scientific proof of this conclusion, see page 121 of Mr. Bailly's work, where the subject is discussed technically.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 660 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"decide the question, we may be permitted to make a few remarks to those who may be inclined to believe that it is modernobservations and calculations which have enabled the Hindus to determine the past positions of the heavenly bodies. It is far fromeasy to determine the celestial movements with sufficient accuracy to ascend the stream of time for 4592 years, and to describe thephenomena which must have occurred at that period.We possess to-day excellent instruments; exact observations have been made for some two or three centuries, which already permit usto calculate with considerable accuracy the average motions of the planets; we have the observations of the Chaldeans, of Hipparchusand of Ptolemy, which, owing to their remoteness from the present time, permit us to fix these motions with greater certainty. Still wecannot undertake to represent with invariable accuracy the observations throughout the long period intervening between theChaldeans and ourselves; and still less can we undertake to determine with exactitude events occurring 4592 years before our day.Cassini and Maier have each determined the secular motion of the moon, and they differ by 3m. 43s. This difference would give risein forty-six centuries to an uncertainty of nearly three degrees in the moon's place. Doubtless one of these determinations is moreaccurate than the other; and it is for observations of very great antiquity to decide between them. But in very remote periods, whereobservations are lacking, it follows that we are uncertain as to the phenomena. How, then, could the Hindus have calculated backfrom the year 1491 A.D. to the year 3102 before our era, if they were only recent students of astronomy?The Orientals have never been what we are. However high an opinion of their knowledge we may form from the examination of theirAstronomy, we cannot suppose them ever to have possessed that great array of instruments which distinguishes our modernobservatories, and which is the product of simultaneous progress in various arts, nor could they have possessed that genius fordiscovery, which has hitherto seemed to belong exclusively to Europe, and which, supplying the place of time, causes the rapidprogress of science and of human intelligence. If the Asiatics have been powerful, learned and wise, it is power and time which haveproduced their merit and success of all kinds. Power has founded or destroyed their empires; now it has erected edifices imposing bytheir bulk, now it has reduced them to venerable ruins; and while these vicissitudes alternated with each other, patience accumulatedknowledge; and prolonged experience produced wisdom. It is the antiquity of the nations of the East which has erected their scientificfame.If the Hindus possessed in 1491 a knowledge of the heavenly motions------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 661 THE BEGINNING OF KALI-YUG.sufficiently accurate to enable them to calculate backwards for 4,592 years, it follows that they could only have obtained thisknowledge from very ancient observations. To grant them such knowledge, while refusing them the observations from which it isderived, is to suppose an impossibility; it would be equivalent to assuming that at the outset of their career they had already reapedthe harvest of time and experience. While on the other hand, if their epoch of 3102 is assumed to be real, it would follow that theHindus had simply kept pace with successive centuries down to the year 1491 of our era. Thus, time itself was their teacher; they knewthe motions of the heavenly bodies during these periods, because they had seen them; and the duration of the Hindu people on earthis the cause of the fidelity of its records and the accuracy of its calculations.It would seem that the problem as to which of the two epochs of 3102 and 1491 is the real one ought to be solved by oneconsideration, viz., that the ancients in general, and particularly the Hindus, calculated, and therefore observed, eclipses only. SaysBailly:--Now, there was no eclipse of the sun at the moment of the epoch 1492; and no eclipse of the moon either 14 days before or after thatmoment. Therefore the epoch 1491 is not based on an observation. As regards the epoch 3102, the Brahmins of Tirvalour place it atsunrise on February 18th. The sun was then in the first point of the Zodiac according to its true longitude. The other tables show thatat the preceding midnight the moon was in the same place, but according to its average longitude. The Brahmins tell us also that thisfirst point, the origin of their Zodiac, was, in the year 3102, 54 degrees behind the equinox. It follows that the origin -- the first point oftheir Zodiac -- was therefore in the sixth degree of Libra.There occurred, therefore, about this time and place an average conjunction; \"and indeed this conjunction is given in our best tables:La Caille's for the sun and Maier's for the moon.\" There was no eclipse of the sun, the moon being too distant from her node; butfourteen days later, the moon having approached the node, must have been eclipsed. Maier's tables, used without correction foracceleration, give this eclipse; but they place it during the day when it could not have been observed in India. Cassini's tables give itas occurring at night, which shows that Maier's motions are too rapid for distant centuries, when the acceleration is not allowed for;and which also proves that in spite of the improvement of our knowledge we can still be uncertain as to the actual aspect of theheavens in past times.Therefore we believe that as between the two Hindu epochs, the real one is the year 3102, because it was accompanied by aneclipse which could be observed, and which must have served to determine it. This------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 662 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.is a first proof of the truth of the longitude assigned by the Hindus to the sun and the moon at this instant; and this proof wouldperhaps be sufficient, were it not that this ancient determination becomes of the greatest importance for the verification of themotions of these bodies, and must therefore be borne out by every possible proof of its authenticity."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"We notice, first, that the Hindus seem to have combined two epochs together into the year 3102. The Tirvalour Brahmins reckonprimarily from the first moment of the Kali-Yug; but they have a second epoch placed 2d. 3h. 32m. 30s. later. The latter is the trueastronomical epoch, while the former seems to be a civil era. But if this epoch of the Kali-Yug had no reality, and was the mere resultof a calculation, why should it be thus divided? Their calculated astronomical epoch would have become that of the Kali-Yug, whichwould have been placed at the conjunction of the sun and the moon, as is the case with the epochs of the three other tables. Theymust have had some reason for distinguishing between the two; and this reason can only be due to the circumstances and the time ofthe epoch; which therefore could not be the result of calculation. This is not all; starting from the solar epoch determined by the risingof the sun on February 18th, 3102, and tracing back events 2d. 3h. 32m. 30s., we come to 2h. 27m. 30s. a.m. of February 16th, whichis the instant of the beginning of Kali-Yuga. It is curious that this age has not been made to commence at one of the four greatdivisions of the day. It might be suspected that the epoch should be midnight, and that the 2h. 27m. 30s. are a meridian correction.But whatever may have been the reason for fixing on this moment, it is plain that were this epoch the result of calculation, it wouldhave been just as easy to carry it back to midnight, so as to make the epoch correspond to one of the chief divisions of the day,instead of placing it at a moment fixed by the fraction of a day.2nd. The Hindus assert that at the first moment of Kali-Yug there was a conjunction of all the planets; and their tables show thisconjunction while ours indicate that it might actually have occurred. Jupiter and Mercury were in exactly the same degree of theecliptic; Mars being 8 [[degrees]] and Saturn 17 [[degrees]] distant from it. It follows that about this time, or some fourteen days afterthe commencement of Kali-Yug, the Hindus saw four planets emerge successively from the Sun's rays; first Saturn, then Mars, thenJupiter and Mercury, and these planets appeared united in a somewhat small space. Although Venus was not among them, the tastefor the marvellous caused it to be called a general conjunction of all the planets. The testimony of the Brahmins here coincides withthat of our tables; and this evidence, the result of a tradition, must be founded on actual observation.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 663 THE EYE OF TAURUS.3rd. We may remark that this phenomenon was visible about a fortnight after the epoch, and exactly at the time when the eclipse ofthe moon must have been observed, which served to fix the epoch. The two observations mutually confirm each other; and whoevermade the one must have made the other also.4th. We may believe also that the Hindus made at the same time a determination of the place of the moon's node; this seemsindicated by their calculation. They give the longitude of this point of the lunar orbit for the time of their epoch, and to this they addas a constant 40m., which is the node's motion in 12d. 14h. It is as if they stated that this determination was made 13 days after theirepoch, and that to make it correspond to that epoch, we must add the 40m. through which the node has retrograded in the interval.This observation is, therefore, of the same date as that of the lunar eclipse; thus giving three observations, which are mutuallyconfirmatory.5th. It appears from the description of the Hindu Zodiac given by M. C. Gentil, that on it the places of the stars named \"The Eye ofTaurus\" and the \"Wheat-ear of Virgo,\" can be determined for the commencement of the Kali-Yug.Now, comparing these places with the actual positions, reduced by our precession of the equinoxes to the moment in question, we seethat the point of origin of the Hindu Zodiac must lie between the fifth and sixth degree of Libra. The Brahmins, therefore, were right inplacing it in the sixth degree of that sign, the more so since this small difference may be due to the proper motion of the stars which isunknown.Thus it was yet another observation which guided the Hindus in this fairly accurate determination of the first point of their movablezodiac.It does not seem possible to doubt the existence in antiquity of observations of this date. The Persians say that four beautiful starswere placed as guardians at the four corners of the world. Now it so happens that at the commencement of Kali Yug, 3000 or 3100years before our era, the \"Eye of the Bull\" and the \"Heart of the Scorpion\" were exactly at the equinoctial points, while the \"Heart ofthe Lion\" and the \"Southern Fish\" were pretty near the solstitial points. An observation of the rising of the Pleiades in the evening,seven days before the autumnal equinox, also belongs to the year 3000 before our era. This and similar observations collected inPtolemy's calendars, though he does not give their authors, these observations, which are older than those of the Chaldeans, may wellbe the work of the Hindus. They are well acquainted with the constellation of the Pleiades, and while we call it vulgarly the\"Poussiniere\" they name it: Pillaloo-codi -- the \"Hen and chickens.\" This name has therefore, passed from people to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 664 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.people, and comes to us from the most ancient nations of Asia. We see that the Hindus must have observed the rising of the Pleiades,and have made use of it to regulate their years and their months; for this constellation is also called Krittika. Now they have a monthof the same name, and this coincidence can only be due to the fact that this month was announced by the rising or setting of theconstellation in question. But what is even more decisive as showing that the Hindus observed the stars, and in the same way that wedo, marking their position by their longitude, is a fact mentioned by Augustinus Riccius that, according to observations attributed toHermes, and made 1,985 years before Ptolemy, the brilliant star in the Lyre and that in the Heart of the Hydra were each sevendegrees in advance of their respective positions as determined by Ptolemy."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"This determination seems very extraordinary. The stars advance regularly with respect to the equinox; and Ptolemy ought to havefound the longitudes 28 degrees in excess of what they were 1985 years before his time. Besides, there is a remarkable peculiarityabout this fact; the same error or difference being found in the positions of both stars; therefore the error was due to some causeaffecting both stars equally. It was to explain this peculiarity that the Arab Thebith imagined the stars to have an oscillatorymovement, causing them to advance and recede alternately.This hypothesis was easily disproved; but the observations attributed to Hermes remained unexplained. Their explanation, however, isfound in Hindu Astronomy. At the date fixed for these observations, 1985 years before Ptolemy, the first point of the Hindu Zodiac was35 degrees in advance of the equinox; therefore the longitudes reckoned for this point are 35 degrees in excess of those reckonedfrom the equinox. But after the lapse of 1985 years the stars would have advanced 28 degrees, and there would remain a differenceof only 7 degrees between the longitudes of Hermes and those of Ptolemy, and the difference would be the same for the two stars,since it is due to the difference between the starting-points of the Hindu Zodiac and that of Ptolemy, which reckons from the equinox.This explanation is so simple and natural that it must be true. We do not know whether Hermes, so celebrated in antiquity, was aHindu, but we see that the observations attributed to him are reckoned in the Hindu manner, and we conclude that they were made bythe Hindus, who, therefore, were able to make all the observations we have enumerated, and which we find noted in their tables.6th. The observation of the year 3102, which seems to have fixed their epoch, was not a difficult one. We see that the Hindus, havingonce determined the moon's daily motion of 13deg. 10m. 35sec., made------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 665 HINDU ASTRONOMICAL METHODS.use of it to divide the Zodiac into 27 constellations, related to the period of the moon, which takes about 27 days to describe it.It was by this method that they determined the positions of the stars in this Zodiac; it was thus they found that a certain star of the Lyrewas in 8h. 24m., the Heart of the Hydra in 4d. 7h., longitudes which are ascribed to Hermes, but which are calculated on the HinduZodiac. Similarly, they discovered that the \"Wheatear of Virgo\" forms the commencement of their fifteenth constellation, and the \"Eyeof Taurus\" the end of the fourth; these stars being the one in 6d. 6h. 40m., the other in 1d. 23h. 20min. of the Hindu Zodiac. Thisbeing so, the eclipse of Moon which occurred 14 days after the Kali Yug epoch, took place at a point between the \"Wheat Ear\" ofVirgo and the star [[ ]] of the same constellation. These stars are very approximately a constellation apart, the one beginning thefifteenth, the other the sixteenth. Thus it would not be difficult to determine the moon's place by measuring her distance from one ofthese stars; from this they deduced the position of the sun, which is opposite to the moon, and then, knowing their average motions,they calculated that the moon was at the first point of the Zodiac according to her average longitude at midnight on the 17th-18thFebruary of the year 3,102 before our era, and that the sun occupied the same place six hours later according to his true longitude; anevent which fixes the commencement of the Hindu year.7th. The Hindus state that 20,400 years before the age of Kali Yug, the first point of their Zodiac coincided with the vernal equinox,and that the sun and moon were in conjunction there. This epoch is obviously fictitious;* but we may inquire from what point, fromwhat epoch, the Hindus set out in establishing it. Taking the Hindu values for the revolution of the sun and moon, viz., 365d. 6h. 12m.30s., and 27d. 7h. 43m. 13s., we have --20,400 revolutions of the sun = 7,451,277d. 2h.272,724 revolutions of the moon = 7,451,277d. 7h.Such is the result obtained by starting from the Kali Yuga epoch; and the assertion of the Hindus, that there was a conjunction at thetime stated, is founded on their tables; but if, using the same elements, we start from the era of the year 1491, or from another placedin the year 1282, of which we shall speak later, there will always be a difference of almost one or two days. It is both just and natural,in verifying the Hindu calculations, to take those among their elements which give the same result as they had themselves arrived at,and to set out from that one among their epochs which enables us to arrive at[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Why it should be \"fictitious\" can never be made plain by European scientists.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 666 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the fictitious epoch in question. Hence, since to make this calculation they must have set out from their real epoch, the one which wasfounded on an observation and not from any of those which were derived by this very calculation from the former, it follows that theirreal epoch was that of the year 3102 before our era.8th. The Tiravalore Brahmins give the Moon's motion as 7d. 2h. 8m. on the movable Zodiac, and as 9d. 7h. 45m. 1s. as referred tothe equinox in a great period of 1,600,984 days, or 4,386 years and 94 days. We believe this motion to have been determined byobservation; and we must state at the outset that this period is of an extent which renders it but ill suited to the calculation of themean motions.In their astronomical calculations the Hindus make use of periods of 248, 3,031, and 12,372 days; but, apart from the fact that theseperiods, though much too short, do not present the inconvenience of the former, they contain an exact number of revolutions of the"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"moon referred to its apogee. They are in reality mean motions. The great period of 1,600,984 is not a sum of accumulatedrevolutions; there is no reason why it should contain 1,600,984 rather than 1,600,985 days. It would seem that observation alone musthave fixed the number of days and marked the beginning and end of the period. This period ends on the 21st of May, 1282, of ourera at 5h. 15m. 30s. at Benares. The moon was then in apogee, according to the Hindus, and her longitude was ... 7d. 13h. 45m. 1s.Maier gives the longitude as ... 7d. 13h. 53m. 48s.And places the apogee at ... ... 7d. 14h. 6m. 54s.The determination of the moon's place by the Brahmins thus differs only by nine minutes from ours, and that of the apogee by twenty-two minutes, and it is very evident that they could only have obtained this agreement with our best tables and this exactitude in thecelestial positions by observation. If then, observation fixed the end of this period, there is every reason to believe that it determinedits commencement. But then this motion, determined directly, and from nature, would of necessity be in close agreement with thetrue motions of the heavenly bodies.And in fact the Hindu motion during this long period of 4,883 years, does not differ by a minute from that of Cassini, and agreesequally with that of Maier. Thus two peoples, the Hindus and the Europeans, placed at the two extremities of the world, and perhapsas distant by their institutions, have obtained precisely the same results as regards the moon's motions; and an agreement whichwould be inconceivable, if it were not based on the observation and mutual imitation of nature. We must remark that the four tables ofthe Hindus are all copies of the same Astronomy. It cannot be denied that the Siamese tables existed------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 667 THE ARYAN HINDUS VINDICATED.in 1687, when they were brought from India by M. de la Loubere. At that time the tables of Cassini and Maier were not in existence,and thus the Hindus were already in possession of the exact motion contained in these tables, while we did not yet possess it.* It must,therefore, be admitted that the accuracy of this Hindu motion is the point of observation. It is exact throughout this period of 4,383years, because it was taken from the sky itself -- and if observation determined its close, it fixed its commencement also. It is thelongest period which has been observed and of which the recollection is preserved in the annals of Astronomy. It has its origin in theepoch of the year 3102, B.C., and it is a demonstrative proof of the reality of that epoch.Bailly is referred to at such length, as he is one of the few scientific men who have tried to do full justice to the Astronomy of theAryans. From John Bentley down to Burgess' \"Surya-Siddhanta,\" not one astronomer has been fair enough to the most learned peopleof Antiquity. However distorted and misunderstood the Hindu Symbology, no Occultist can fail to do it justice once that he knowssomething of the Secret Sciences; nor will he turn away from their metaphysical and mystical[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The following is an answer to those men of science who might suspect that our Astronomy was carried to India and communicated tothe Hindus by our Missionaries. 1st. Hindu astronomy has its own peculiar forms, characterized by their originality; if it had been ourastronomy translated, great skill and knowledge would have been needed to disguise the theft. 2nd. When adopting the meanmovement of the moon, they would have adopted also the inclination of the ecliptic, the equation of the sun's centre, the length ofthe year; these elements differ completely from ours, and are remarkably accurate as applying to the epoch of 3102; while they wouldbe exceedingly erroneous if they had been calculated for last century. 3rd, finally, our missionaries could not have communicated tothe Hindus in 1687 the tables of Cassini, which were not then in existence; they could have known only the mean motions of Tycho,Riccioli, Copernicus, Bouilland, Kepler, Longomontanus, and those of the tables of Alphonso. I will now give a tabular view of thesemean motions for 4383 years and 94 days:--Table. ------------- Mean Motion. --- Difference from Hindu.Alphonso ............9d 7h 2m 47s ... - 0h 42m 14sCopernicus ......... 9d 6h 2m 13s ... - 1h 42m 48sTycho .............. 9d 7h 54m 40s .. + 0h 9m 39sKepler ............. 9d 6h 57m 35s .. - 0h 47m 26sLongomontanus ...... 9d 7h 2m 13s ... - 0h 42m 48sBouilland .......... 9d 6h 48m 8s ... - 0h 58m 53sRiccioli ........... 9d 7h 53m 57s .. + 0h 8m 56sCassini ............ 9d 7h 44m 11s .. - 0h 0m 50sIndian ............. 9d 7h 45m 1sNone of these mean motions, except Cassini's, agrees with that of the Hindus, who therefore, did not borrow their mean motions, sincetheir figures agree only with those of Cassini, whose tables were not in existence in 1687. This mean motion of the moon belongs,therefore, to the Hindus, who could only have obtained it by observation.\" -- Bailly's \"Traite de l'Astronomie Indienne et Orientale.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 668 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"interpretation of the Zodiac, even though the whole Pleiades of Royal Astronomical Societies rise in arms against their mathematicalrendering of it. The descent and re-ascent of the Monad or Soul cannot be disconnected from the Zodiacal signs, and it looks morenatural, in the sense of the fitness of things, to believe in a mysterious sympathy between the metaphysical soul and the brightconstellations, and in the influence of the latter on the former, than in the absurd notion that the creators of Heaven and Earth haveplaced in heaven the types of twelve vicious Jews. And if, as the author of The Gnostics asserts, the aim of all the Gnostic schools andthe later Platonists \"was to accommodate the old faith to the influence of Buddhistic theosophy, the very essence of which was thatthe innumerable gods of the Hindu mythology were but names for the ENERGIES of the First Triad in its successive AVATARS ormanifestations unto man,\" whither can we turn to trace these theosophic ideas to their very root -- better than to old Indian wisdom?We say it again: archaic Occultism would remain incomprehensible to all, if it were rendered otherwise than through the more familiarchannels of Buddhism and Hinduism. For the former is the emanation of the latter; and both are children of one mother -- ancientLemuro-Atlantean Wisdom.-------XVIII.SUMMARY OF THE MUTUAL POSITION.THE reader has had the whole case presented to him from both sides, and it remains with him to decide whether its summary standsin our favour or not. If there were such a thing as void, a vacuum in Nature, one would find it produced, according to a physical law, inthe minds of helpless admirers of the \"lights\" of science, who pass their time in mutually destroying their teachings. If ever the theorythat \"two lights make darkness\" found its application it is in this case, when one half of the \"lights\" imposes its Forces and \"modes ofmotion\" on the belief of the faithful, and the other half opposes the very existence of the same. \"Ether, Matter, Energy\" -- the sacredhypostatical trinity, the three principles of the truly unknown God of Science, called by them PHYSICAL NATURE!Theology is taken to task and ridiculed for believing in the union of three persons in one Godhead -- one God as to substance, threepersons as to individuality; and we are laughed at for our belief in unproved and unprovable doctrines, in Angels and Devils, Godsand Spirits. And,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 669 THE EXACT SCIENCES OF -- NEGATION.indeed, that which made the Scientists win the day over Theology in the Great \"Conflict between Religion and Science,\" wasprecisely the argument that neither the identity of that substance, nor the triple individuality claimed, after having been conceived,invented, and worked out in the depths of Theological Consciousness, could be proved by any Scientific inductive process ofreasoning, least of all on the evidence of our senses. Religion must perish, it is said, because it teaches mysteries. Mystery is thenegation of Common Sense, and Science repels it. According to Mr. Tyndall, metaphysics is fiction, like poetry. The man of Sciencetakes nothing on trust; rejects everything that is not proven to him, while the Theologian accepts everything on blind faith. TheTheosophist and the Occultist, who take nothing on trust, not even exact Science, the Spiritualist who denies dogma but believes inSpirits and in invisible but potential influences, all share in the same contempt. Very well, then; what we have to do now, is toexamine for the last time whether exact Science does not act precisely in the same way as Theosophy, Spiritualism, and Theologydo.In a work by Mr. S. Laing, considered a standard book on Science, \"Modern Science and Modern Thought,\" the author of which,according to the laudatory review of the Times, \"exhibits with much power and effect the immense discoveries of Science, and itsnumerous victories over old opinions, whenever THEY HAVE THE RASHNESS TO CHALLENGE CONCLUSIONS WITH IT,\" one readsin chapter III., \"On Matter,\" as follows:\"WHAT IS THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE COMPOSED OF? ETHER, MATTER, ENERGY\" . . . . . is the answer.We stop to ask, \"What is Ether?\" And Mr. Laing answers in the name of Science:--\"Ether is not actually known to us BY ANY TEST OF WHICH THE SENSES CAN TAKE COGNIZANCE, but is a sort of mathematicalsubstance which WE ARE COMPELLED TO ASSUME in order to account for the phenomena of light and heat.\"And what is matter? Do you know more about it than you do about the \"hypothetical\" agent, Ether?\"In perfect strictness, it is true that chemical investigations can tell us . . . . NOTHING DIRECTLY of the composition of living matter,and . . . . it is also in strictness true, THAT WE KNOW NOTHING about the composition of ANY (material) BODY WHATEVER AS ITIS.\" (Lecture on Protoplasm by Mr. Huxley.)And Energy? Surely you can define the third person of the Trinity of your Material universe?\"THE ENERGY IS THAT WHICH IS ONLY KNOWN TO US BY ITS EFFECTS.\" (Books on Physics.)Pray explain, for this is rather hazy.\"IN MECHANICS THERE IS ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL ENERGY: WORK"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 670 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.ACTUALLY PERFORMED, AND THE CAPACITY FOR PERFORMING IT.

What is it? . . . . .\"WE DO NOT KNOW!\" IS THE INVARIABLE ANSWER. \"IT IS AN EMPTY SHADOW OF MY IMAGINATION,\" explains Mr. Huxley inhis Physical Basis of Life.Thus the whole structure of Modern Science is built on a kind of \"mathematical abstraction,\" on a Protean \"Substance which eludesthe senses,\" (Dubois Reymond,) and on effects, the shadowy and illusive will-o'-the-wisps of a something entirely unknown to andbeyond the reach of Science, \"Self-moving\" atoms! Self-moving Suns, planets, and stars! But who, then, or what are they all, if theyare self-endowed with motion? Why then should you, physicists, laugh and deride our \"Self-moving ARCHAEUS\"? Mystery is rejectedand scorned by Science, and \"MYSTERY is the fatality of Science,\" as Father Felix has truly said. . . . . Science cannot escape it!\"The language of the French preacher is ours, and we quote it in \"Isis Unveiled\" (Vide Vol. I. 338-9).

The grain of sand,gentlemen, has been studied four thousand years by science, she has turned and returned it; she divides it and subdivides it; shetorments it with her experiments; she vexes it with her questions to snatch from it the final word as to its secret constitution; she asks it,with an insatiable curiosity: 'Shall I divide thee infinitesimally?' Then suspended over this abyss, science hesitates, she stumbles, shefeels dazzled, she becomes dizzy, and in despair says: I DO NOT KNOW.\"\"But if you are so fatally ignorant of the genesis and hidden nature of a grain of sand, how should you have an intuition as to thegeneration of a single living being? Whence in the living being does life come? Where does it commence? What is the lifeprinciple?\"*Do the men of science deny all these charges?

We are struck dumb by an astonishment which no microscope can relieve, doubting not only the powerof our instrument, but even whether we ourselves possess the intellectual elements which will ever enable us to grapple with theultimate structural energies of nature.\"How little is known of the material universe, indeed, has now been suspected for years, on the very admissions of these men of sciencethemselves. And now there are some materialists who would even make away with Ether -- or whatever Science calls the infiniteSubstance, the noumenon of which the Buddhists call Swabhavat -- as well as with atoms, too dangerous both on account of theirancient philosophical and their present Christian and theological associations. From the earliest philosophers whose records passed toposterity, down to our present age, which, if it denies \"invisible Beings\" in Space, can never be so insane as to deny a plenum ofsome sort -- the fulness of the universe was an accepted belief. And what it was said to contain, one learns from Hermes Trismegistus(in Mrs. Kingsford's able rendering) -- who is made to say:--\"Concerning the void . . . my judgment is that it does not exist, that it never existed, and that it never will exist, for all the various partsof the universe are filled, as the earth also is complete and full of bodies, differing in quality and in form, having their species andtheir magnitude, one larger, one smaller, one solid, one tenuous. The larger . . . are easily perceived; the smaller . . . are difficult toapprehend, or altogether invisible. We know only of their existence by the sensation of feeling, wherefore many persons deny suchentities to be bodies, and regard them as simply spaces,* but it is impossible there should be such spaces. For if indeed there shouldbe anything outside the universe . . . then it would be a space occupied by intelligent beings analogous to its (the universe's) divinity .. . . . . I speak of the genii, for I hold they dwell with us, and of the heroes who dwell above us, between the earth and the highest airs;wherein are neither clouds nor any tempest\" (p. 84)."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"And we \"hold\" it too.

This necessary explanation may be closed here by giving, in the words of Hermes, the belief on thisparticular point of the whole world of mystics:--\"There are many orders of the gods; and in all there is an intelligent part. It is not to be supposed they do not come within the rangeof our senses; on the contrary, we perceive them, better even than those which are called visible. . . There are then gods, superior toall appearances; after them come the gods whose principle is spiritual; these gods being sensible, in conformity with their doubleorigin, manifest all things by a sensible nature, each of them illuminating his works one by another.* The Supreme Being of Heaven,or of all that is comprehended under this name, is Zeus, for it is by Heaven that Zeus gives life to all things. The Supreme Being ofthe Sun is Light, for it is by the disk of the Sun that we receive the benefit of the light. The thirty-six horoscopes of the fixed stars havefor supreme Being or Prince, him whose name is Pantomorphos, or having all forms, because he gives divine forms to divers types.The seven planets, or wandering spheres, have for Supreme Spirits Fortune and Destiny, who uphold the eternal stability of the lawsof nature throughout incessant transformation and perpetual agitation. The ether is the instrument or medium by which all isproduced.\"This is quite philosophical and in accordance with the spirit of Eastern esotericism: for all the Forces, such as Light, Heat, Electricity,etc., etc., are called the \"Gods\" -- esoterically.It must be so, since the esoteric teachings in Egypt and India were identical. And, therefore, the personification of Fohat synthesizingall the manifesting forces in nature is a legitimate result. Moreover, as will be shown in the division that follows this one, the real andOccult forces in nature only now begin to be known -- and even in this case, by heterodox, not orthodox, Science (See also § X., THECOMING FORCE), though their existence, in one instance at any rate, is corroborated, and certified to by an immense number ofeducated people and even by some official men of science.This sentence, moreover, in Stanza VI., \"Fohat sets in motion the primordial World-germs, or the aggregation of Cosmic atoms andmatter, some one way, some another, in the opposite direction\" -- looks orthodox and Scientific enough. For there is, at all events,one fact in support of this position fully recognized by Science, and it is this. The meteoric showers (periodical in November andAugust) belong to[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Hermes here includes as gods the sensible Forces of nature, the elements and the phenomena of the Universe,\" remarks Mrs. A.Kingsford in a foot-note explaining it very correctly.

The aphelion of this ring is 1,732 millions of miles beyond the orbit ofNeptune, its plane is inclined to the Earth's orbit at an angle of 64 [[degrees]] 3', and the direction of the meteoric swarm movinground this orbit is contrary to that of the Earth's revolution.This fact, recognized only in 1833, shows it to be the modern rediscovery of what was very anciently known. Fohat turns with his twohands in contrary directions the \"seed\" and \"the curds,\" or Cosmic matter; is turning, in clearer language, particles in a highlyattenuated condition, and nebulae.Outside the boundaries of the solar system, it is other Suns, and especially the mysterious \"central Sun\" (the \"Abode of the invisibledeity\" as some reverend gentlemen have called it) that determines the motion of bodies and their direction. That motion serves alsoto differentiate the homogeneous matter, round and between the several bodies, into elements and sub-elements unknown to ourearth, which are regarded by modern Science as distinct individual elements, whereas they are merely temporary appearances,changing with every small cycle within the Manvantara, some Esoteric works calling them \"Kalpic Masks.\"Fohat is the key in Occultism which opens and unriddles the multiform symbols and respective allegories in the so-called mythology ofevery nation; demonstrating the wonderful philosophy and the deep insight into the mysteries of nature, in the Egyptian andChaldean as well as in the Aryan religions. Fohat, shown in his true character, proves how deeply versed were all those prehistoricnations in every science of nature, now called physical and chemical branches of natural philosophy. In India, Fohat is the scientific"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"aspect of both Vishnu and Indra, the latter older and more important in the Rig Veda than his sectarian successor; while in EgyptFohat was known as Toum issued of Noot,* or Osiris in his character of a primordial god, creator of heaven and of beings (see chapterxvii., \"Book of the Dead\"). For Toum is spoken of as the Protean god who generates other gods and gives himself the form he likes; the\"master of life\" \"giving their vigour to the gods\" (chapter lxxix.) He is the overseer of the gods, and he \"who creates spirits and givesthem shape and life\"; he is \"the north wind and the spirit of the west;\" and finally the \"Setting Sun of Life,\" or the vital electric forcethat leaves the body at death, wherefore the defunct begs that Toum should give him the breath from his right nostril (positive elec-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Oh Toum, Toum! issued from the great (female) which is in the bosom of the waters\" (the great Deep or Space) . . . \"Thou,luminous through the two Lions\" (the dual Force or power of the two solar eyes, or the electro-positive and the electro-negative forces.(See Book of the Dead, III., and Egyptian Pantheon, chapter ii.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 674 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.tricity) that he might live in his second form. Both the hieroglyph, and the text of chapter lxii. in the \"Book of the Dead,\" show theidentity of Toum with Fohat. The former represents a man standing erect with the hieroglyph of the breaths in his hands. The lattersays:--\"I open to the chief of An (Heliopolis), I am Toum. I cross the water spilt by Thot-Hapi, the lord of the horizon, and am the divider ofthe earth\" (Fohat divides Space and, with his Sons, the earth into seven zones) . . . .. . . . \"I cross the heavens, and am the two Lions. I am Ra, I am Aam, I ate my heir.* . . . . I glide on the soil of the field of Aanroo,**given me by the master of limitless eternity. I am the germ of eternity. I am Toum, to whom eternity is accorded. . . . \"The very words used by Fohat in the XIth Book, and the very titles given him. In the Egyptian Papyri the whole Cosmogony of theSecret Doctrine is found scattered about in isolated sentences, even in the \"Book of Dead.\" Number seven is quite as much insistedupon and emphasized therein as in the Book of Dzyan. \"The Great Water (the Deep or Chaos) is said to be seven cubits deep\" --\"cubits\" standing here of course for divisions, zones, and principles. Therein, \"in the great mother, all the Gods, and the seven greatones are born.\" (See chapter cviii., 4, Book of the Dead and Egyptian Pantheon). Both Fohat and Toum are addressed as the \"Greatones of the Seven Magic Forces,\" who, \"conquer the Serpent Apap\" or Matter.No student of occultism, however, ought to be betrayed, by the usual phraseology used in the translations of Hermetic Works, intobelieving that the ancient Egyptians or Greeks spoke of, and referred, monk-like, at every moment in conversation, to a SupremeBeing, God, the \"One Father and Creator of all,\" etc., as found on every page of such translations. No such thing indeed; and thosetexts are not the original Egyptian texts. They are Greek compilations, the earliest of which does not go beyond the early period ofNeo-Platonism.

As for the Egyptian in general, as M. Maspero well remarks, whenever he\"arrived at the notion of divine Unity, the God One was never 'God,' simply.\" And Lepage Renouf very justly observed that the wordNouter, nouti, \"god\" had never ceased being a generic name with the Egyptians, nor has it ever become a personal pronoun. EveryGod was the \"one living and unique God\" with them. Their \"monotheism was purely geographical. If the Egyptian of Memphisproclaimed the unity of Phtah to the exclusion of Ammon, the Thebeian Egyptian proclaimed the unity of Ammon to the exclusion ofPhtah,\" as we now see done in India in the case of the Saivas and the Vaishnavas. \"Ra, the 'One God' at Heliopolis is not the same asOsiris, the 'One God' at Abydos, and can be worshipped side by side with him, without being absorbed by his neighbour. The one godis but the god of the nome or the city, noutir, noutti, and does not exclude the existence of the one god of that town or of theneighbouring nome. In short, whenever speaking of Egyptian Monotheism, one ought to speak of the Gods 'One' of Egypt, and not ofthe one god\" (Maspero, in the Guide au Musee de Boulak.) It is by this feature, pre-eminently Egyptian, that the authenticity of the"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"various so-called Hermetic Books, ought to be tested; and it is totally absent from the Greek fragments known as such. This proves thata Greek Neo-Platonic, or even a Christian hand, had no small share in the editing of such works. Of course the fundamentalphilosophy is there, and in many a place -- intact. But the style has been altered and smoothed in a monotheistic direction, as much,if not more than that of the Hebrew Genesis in its Greek and Latin translations. They may be Hermetic works, but not works written byeither of the two Hermes -- or rather, by Thot (Hermes) the directing intelligence of the Universe (See ch. xciv., Book of the Dead), orby Thot, his terrestrial incarnation called Trismegistus, of the Rosetta stone.But all is doubt, negation, iconoclasm and brutal indifference, in our age of the hundred \"isms\" and no religion. Every idol is brokensave the Golden Calf.Unfortunately, no nation or nations can escape their Karmic fate any more than units and individuals do. History itself is dealt with bythe so-called historians as unscrupulously as legendary lore. For this, Augustin Thierry has made the amende honorable, if one maybelieve his biographers. He deplored the erroneous principle that made them all (the would-be historiographers) lose their way, andeach presume to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 1, Page]] 676 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.correct tradition, \"that vox populi which nine times out of ten is vox Dei;\" and he finally admitted that in legend alone rests realhistory; for \"legend,\" he adds, \"is living tradition, and three times out of four it is truer than what we call History.\"*While Materialists deny everything in the universe, save matter, Archaeologists are trying to dwarf antiquity, and seek to destroy everyclaim to ancient Wisdom by tampering with Chronology. Our present-day Orientalists and Historical writers are to ancient History thatwhich the white ants are to the buildings in India. More dangerous even than those Termites, the modern Archaeologists -- the\"authorities\" of the future in the matter of Universal History -- are preparing for the History of past nations the fate of certain edifices intropical countries: \"History will tumble down and break into atoms in the lap of the twentieth century, devoured to its foundations byher annalists,\" said Michelet. Very soon, indeed, under their combined efforts, it will share the fate of those ruined cities in bothAmericas, which lie deeply buried under impassable virgin forests. Historical facts will remain as concealed from view by theinextricable jungles of modern hypotheses, denials and scepticism. But very happily actual History repeats herself, for she proceeds,like everything else, in cycles; and dead facts and events deliberately drowned in the sea of modern scepticism will ascend once moreand reappear on the surface. . . .In our Book II. the very fact that a work with pretensions to philosophy, and which is an exposition of the most abstruse problems, hasto be commenced by tracing the evolution of mankind from what are regarded as supernatural beings -- Spirits -- will arouse the mostmalevolent criticism. Believers in, and the defenders of, the Secret Doctrine, however, will have to bear the accusation of madnessand worse, as philosophically as for long years already the writer has done. Whenever a Theosophist is taxed with insanity, he oughtto reply by quoting from Montesquieu's \"Lettres Persanes.\" \"By opening so freely their lunatic asylums to their supposed madmen,men only seek to assure each other that they are not themselves mad.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------* Revue des Deux Mondes, 1865, pp. 157 and 158.END OF VOL.
