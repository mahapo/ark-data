We see aflower slowly developing from a bud, and the bud from its seed. But whence the latter, with all its predeterminedprogramme of physical transformation, and its invisible, therefore spiritual forces which gradually develop its form, colour,and odour? The word evolution speaks for itself. The germ of the present human race must have preexisted in the parentof this race, as the seed, in which lies hidden the flower of next summer, was developed in the capsule of its parentflower; the parent may be but slightly different, but it still differs from its future progeny. The antediluvian ancestors of thepresent elephant and lizard were, perhaps, the mammoth and the plesiosaurus; why should not the progenitors of ourhuman race have been the \"giants\" of the Vedas, the Voluspa, and the Book of Genesis? While it is positively absurd tobelieve the \"transformation of species\" to have taken place according to some of the more materialistic views of theevolutionists, it is but natural to think that each genus, beginning with the molluscs and ending with man, had modified itsown primordial and distinctive forms. -- \"Isis Unveiled,\" Vol. I., p. 153.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 1]]PRELIMINARY NOTES.-------ON THE ARCHAIC STANZAS, AND THE FOUR PRE-HISTORIC CONTINENTS.\"Facies totius Universi, quamvis infinitis modis variet,Manet tamen semper eadem.\" -- SPINOZA.THE Stanzas, with the Commentaries thereon, in this Book, the second, are drawn from the same Archaic Records as theStanzas on Cosmogony in Book I. As far as possible a verbatim translation is given; but some of the Stanzas were tooobscure to be understood without explanation. Hence, as was done in Book I., while they are first given in full as theystand, when taken verse by verse with their Commentaries an attempt is made to make them clearer, by words added inbrackets, in anticipation of the fuller explanation of the Commentary.As regards the evolution of mankind, the Secret Doctrine postulates three new propositions, which stand in directantagonism to modern science as well as to current religious dogmas: it teaches (a) the simultaneous evolution of seven"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"human groups on seven different portions of our globe; (b) the birth of the astral, before the physical body: the formerbeing a model for the latter; and (c) that man, in this Round, preceded every mammalian -- the anthropoids included -- inthe animal kingdom.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Genesis ch. ii., v. 19. Adam is formed in verse 7, and in verse 19 it is said: \"Out of the ground the Lord God formedevery beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them.\" Thusman was created before the animals; for the animals mentioned in chapter i. are the signs of the Zodiac, while the man,\"male and female,\" is not man, but the Host of the Sephiroth; FORCES, or Angels, \"made in his (God's) image and afterhis likeness.\" The Adam, man, is not made in that likeness, nor is it so asserted in the Bible. Moreover, the Second Adam[[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 2 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The Secret Doctrine is not alone in speaking of primeval MEN born simultaneously on the seven divisions of our Globe. Inthe Divine \"Pymander\" of Hermes we find the same Seven primeval men* evolving from Nature and \"Heavenly Man,\" inthe collective sense of the word, namely, from the Creative Spirits; and in the fragments (collected by George Smith) ofChaldean tablets on which is inscribed the Babylonian Legend of Creation, in the first column of the Cutha tablet, sevenhuman beings with the faces of ravens (black, swarthy complexions), whom \"the (Seven) great gods created,\" arementioned. Or, as explained in lines 16 and 18 -- \"In the midst of the Earth they grew up and became great . . . . Sevenkings, brothers of the same family.\" These are the Seven Kings of Edom to whom reference is made in the Kabala; thefirst race, which was imperfect, i.e., was born before the \"balance\" (sexes) existed, and which was therefore destroyed.(Zohar, Siphrah Dzeniouta, Idrah Suta, 2928, La Kabbale, p. 205.) \"Seven Kings, brethren, appeared and begat children,6,000 in number were their peoples\" (Hibbert Lectures, p. 372). The god Nergas (death) destroyed them. \"How did hedestroy them?\" \"By bringing into equilibrium (or balance) those who did not yet exist\" (Siphrah Dzeniouta). They were\"destroyed,\" as a race, by being merged in their own progeny (by exudation); that is to say, the sexless race reincarnatedin the bisexual[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] is esoterically a septenary which represents seven men, or rather groups ofmen. For the first Adam -- the Kadmon -- is the synthesis of the ten Sephiroth. Of these, the upper triad remains in theArchetypal World as the future \"Trinity,\" while the seven lower Sephiroth create the manifested material world; and thisseptenate is the second Adam. Genesis, and the mysteries upon which it was fabricated, came from Egypt. The \"God\" ofthe 1st chapter of Genesis is the Logos, and the \"Lord God\" of the 2nd chapter the Creative Elohim -- the lower powers.* Thus saith Pymander -- \"This is the mystery that to this day was hidden. Nature being mingled with the Heavenly man(Elohim, or Dhyanis), brought forth a wonder . . . . Seven men, all males and females (Hermaphrodite) . . . according tothe nature of the seven Governors\" -- Book II. v. 29) -- or the seven Hosts of the Pitris or Elohim, who projected orcreated him. This is very clear, but yet, see the interpretations of even our modern theologians, men supposed to beintellectual and learned! In the \"Theological and philosophical works of Hermes Trismegistus, Christian (?) Neoplatonist,\"a work compiled by John David Chambers, of Oriel College, Oxford, the translator wonders \"for whom these seven menare intended?\" He solves the difficulty by concluding that, as \"the original pattern man (Adam Kadmon of ch. i. Genesis)was masculine-feminine, the seven may signify the succeeding patriarchs named in Genesis\" (p. 9) . . . A truly theologicalway of cutting the Gordian knot.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 3 THE LEMNOS-BORN KABIRI.(potentially); the latter in the Androgynes; these again in the sexual, the later third Race; (for further explanation, videinfra). Were the tablets less mutilated, they would be found to contain word for word the same account as given in thearchaic records and in Hermes, at least as regards the fundamental facts, if not as regards minute details; for Hermes is agood deal disfigured by mistranslations.It is quite certain that the seeming supernaturalism of these teachings, although allegorical, is so diametrically opposed tothe dead-letter statements of the Bible* as well as to the latest hypotheses of science, that it will evoke passionate denial.The Occultists, however, know that the traditions of Esoteric Philosophy must be the right ones, simply because they arethe most logical, and reconcile every difficulty. Besides, we have the Egyptian \"Books of Thoth,\" and \"Book of the Dead,\"and the Hindu Puranas with the seven Manus, as well as the Chaldeo-Assyrian accounts, whose tiles mention sevenprimitive men, or Adams, the real meaning of which name may be ascertained through the Kabala. Those who knowanything of the Samothracian mysteries will also remember that the generic name of the Kabiri was the \"Holy Fires,\"which created on seven localities of the island of Electria (or Samothrace) the \"Kabir born of the Holy Lemnos\" (the islandsacred to Vulcan).According to Pindar (See \"Philosophumena,\" Miller's edition, p. 98), this Kabir, whose name was Adamas, was, in thetraditions of Lemnos, the type of the primitive man born from the bosom of the Earth. He was the Archetype of the firstmales in the order of generation, and was one of the seven autochthonous ancestors or progenitors of mankind (ibid, p.108). If, while coupling with this the fact that Samothrace was colonised by the Phoenicians, and before them by themysterious Pelasgians who came from the East, one remembers also the identity of the mystery gods of the Phoenicians,Chaldeans, and Israelites, it will be easy to discover whence came also the confused account of the Noachian deluge.

It is simply another version of the samestory.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 4 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Egyptians, compiled their Genesis and first Cosmogonic traditions -- when these were rewritten by Ezra and others --from the Chaldeo-Akkadian account. It is, therefore, sufficient to examine the Babylonian and Assyrian cuneiform andother inscriptions to find also therein, scattered here and there, not only the original meaning of the name Adam, Admi, orAdami,* but also the creation of seven Adams or roots of men, born of Mother Earth, physically, and of the divine fire ofthe progenitors, spiritually or astrally. The Assyriologists, ignorant of the esoteric teachings, could hardly be expected topay any greater attention to the mysterious and ever-recurring number seven on the Babylonian cylinders, than they paidto it on finding the same in Genesis and the Bible. Yet the number of the ancestral spirits and their seven groups ofhuman progeny are there, notwithstanding the dilapidated condition of the fragments, as plainly as they are to be found in\"Pymander\" and in the \"Book of the Concealed Mystery\" of the Kabala. In the latter Adam Kadmon is the SephirothalTREE, as also the \"Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.\" And that \"Tree,\" says verse 32, \"hath around it sevencolumns,\" or palaces, of the seven creative Angels operating in the spheres of the seven planets on our Globe. As AdamKadmon is a collective name, so also is the name of the man Adam. Says George Smith in his \"Chaldean Account ofGenesis:\" --\"The word Adam used in these legends for the first human being is evidently not a proper name, but is only used as aterm for mankind. Adam appears as a proper name in Genesis, but certainly in some passages is only used in the samesense as the Assyrian word\" (p. 86).Moreover, neither the Chaldean nor the Biblical deluge (the stories of Xisuthrus and Noah) is based on the universal oreven on the Atlantean deluges, recorded in the Indian allegory of Vaivaswata Manu. They are the exoteric allegoriesbased on the esoteric mysteries of Samothrace. If the older Chaldees knew the esoteric truth concealed in the Puraniclegends, the other nations were aware only of the Samothracian mystery, and allegorised it. They adapted it to theirastronomical and anthropological, or rather phallic, notions. Samothrace is known historically to have been famous inantiquity for a deluge, which submerged the country and reached the top of the highest mountains; an event whichhappened before the age of the Argonauts. It was overflowed very[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide § \"Adam-Adami,\" in Part II. of this volume.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 5 THE SECRETS OF KOUYUNJIK.suddenly by the waters of the Euxine, regarded up to that time as a lake.* But the Israelites had, moreover, anotherlegend upon which to base their allegory: the \"deluge,\" that transformed the present Gobi Desert into a sea for the lasttime, some 10 or 12,000 years ago, and which drove many Noahs and their families on to the surrounding mountains. Asthe Babylonian accounts are now only restored from hundreds of thousands of broken fragments (the mound of Kouyunjikalone having yielded to Layard's excavations over twenty thousand fragments of inscriptions), the proofs here cited arecomparatively scanty; yet such as they are, they corroborate almost every one of our teachings, certainly three, at least.These are:--(1.) That the race which was the first to fall into generation was a dark Race (Zalmat Gaguadi), which they call the Adamior dark Race, and that Sarku, or the light Race, remained pure for a long while subsequently.(2.) That the Babylonians recognised two principal Races at the time of the Fall, the Race of the Gods (the Etherealdoubles of the Pitris), having preceded these two. This is Sir H. Rawlinson's opinion. These \"Races\" are our second andthird Root-races.(3) That these seven Gods, each of whom created a man, or group of men, were \"the gods imprisoned or incarnated.\"These gods were: the god Zi; the god Ziku (noble life, Director of purity); the god Mirku (noble crown) \"Saviour from deathof the gods\" (later on) imprisoned, and the creator of \"the dark Race which his hand has made;\" the god Libzu \"wiseamong the gods\"; the god Nissi . . . . and the god Suhhab; and Hea or Sa, their synthesis, the god of wisdom and of theDeep, identified with Oannes-Dagon, at the time of the fall, and called (collectively) the Demiurge, or Creator. (SeeChaldean Account Genesis, p. 82.)There are two \"Creations\" so called, in the Babylonian fragments, and Genesis having adhered to this, one finds its firsttwo chapters distinguished as the Elohite and the Jehovite creations. Their proper order, however, is not preserved inthese or in any other exoteric accounts. Now these \"Creations,\" according to the occult teachings, refer respectively to theformation of the primordial seven men by the progenitors (the Pitris, or Elohim): and to that of the human groups after thefall.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Pliny, 4, c. 12; Strabo, 10; Herodotus, 7, c. 108; Pausanias, 7, c. 4, etc.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 6 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.All this will be examined in the light of science and comparisons drawn from the scriptures of all the ancient nations, theBible included, as we proceed. Meanwhile, before we turn to the Anthropogenesis of the prehistoric Races, it may be"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"useful to agree upon the names to be given to the Continents on which the four great Races, which preceded our AdamicRace, were born, lived, and died. Their archaic and esoteric names were many, and varied with the language of thenationality which mentioned them in its annals and scriptures. That which in the Vendidad, for instance, is referred to asAiryanem Vaego (see Bund. 79, 12) wherein was born the original Zoroaster,* is called in the Puranic literature \"Sveta-Dwipa,\" \"Mount Meru,\" the abode of Vishnu, etc., etc.; and in the Secret Doctrine is simply named the land of the \"Gods\"under their chiefs the \"Spirits of this Planet.\"Therefore, in view of the possible, and even very probable confusion, that may arise, it is considered more convenient toadopt, for each of the four Continents constantly referred to, a name more familiar to the cultured reader. It is proposed,then, to call the first continent, or rather the first terra firma on which the first Race was evolved by the divine progenitors:--I. \"The Imperishable Sacred Land.\"The reasons for this name are explained as follows: This \"Sacred Land\" -- of which more later on -- is stated never tohave shared the fate of the other continents; because it is the only one whose destiny it is to last from the beginning tothe end of the Manvantara throughout each Round. It is the cradle of the first man and the dwelling of the last divinemortal, chosen as a Sishta for the future seed of humanity. Of this mysterious and sacred land very little can be said,except, perhaps, according to a poetical expression in one of the Commentaries, that the \"pole-star has its watchful eyeupon it, from the dawn to the close of the twilight of 'a day' of the GREAT BREATH.\"**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* By \"original\" we mean the \"Amshaspend,\" called \"Zarathustra, the lord and ruler of the Vara made by Yima in that land.\"There were several Zarathustra or Zertusts, the Dabistan alone enumerating thirteen; but these were all thereincarnations of the first one. The last Zoroaster was the founder of the Fire temple of Azareksh and the writer of theworks on the primeval sacred Magian religion destroyed by Alexander.** In India called \"The Day of Brahma.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 7 HYPERBOREAS AND LEMURIA.II. The \"HYPERBOREAN\" will be the name chosen for the Second Continent, the land which stretched out itspromontories southward and westward from the North Pole to receive the Second Race, and comprised the whole ofwhat is now known as Northern Asia. Such was the name given by the oldest Greeks to the far-off and mysterious region,whither their tradition made Apollo the \"Hyperborean\" travel every year. Astronomically, Apollo is of course the Sun, who,abandoning his Hellenic sanctuaries, loved to visit annually his far-away country, where the Sun was said never to set forone half of the year. [[Eggus gar nuktos te kai ematos eisi keleuthoi]], says a verse in the Odyssey (x. 86).But historically, or better, perhaps, ethnologically and geologically, the meaning is different. The land of theHyperboreans, the country that extended beyond Boreas, the frozen-hearted god of snows and hurricanes, who loved toslumber heavily on the chain of Mount Riphaeus, was neither an ideal country, as surmised by the mythologists, nor yet aland in the neighbourhood of Scythia and the Danube.* It was a real Continent, a bona-fide land which knew no winter inthose early days, nor have its sorry remains more than one night and day during the year, even now. The nocturnalshadows never fall upon it, said the Greeks; for it is the land of the Gods, the favourite abode of Apollo, the god of light,and its inhabitants are his beloved priests and servants. This may be regarded as poetised fiction now; but it waspoetised truth then.III. The third Continent, we propose to call \"Lemuria.\" The name is an invention, or an idea, of Mr. P. L. Sclater, whoasserted, between 1850 and 1860, on zoological grounds the actual existence, in prehistoric times, of a Continent whichhe showed to have extended from Madagascar to Ceylon and Sumatra. It included some portions of what is now Africa;but otherwise this gigantic Continent, which stretched from the Indian ocean to Australia, has now wholly disappearedbeneath the waters of the Pacific, leaving here and there only some of its highland tops which are now islands. Mr. A. R.Wallace, the naturalist, \"extends the Australia of tertiary periods to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and perhaps toFiji;\" and from its Marsupial types he infers \"a connection with the Northern Continent during the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Volcker, \"Mythological Geography,\" pp. 145 to 170.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 8 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Secondary period,\" writes Mr. C. Gould in \"Mythical Monsters,\" p. 47. The subject is treated at length elsewhere.*IV. \"Atlantis\" is the Fourth Continent. It would be the first historical land, were the traditions of the ancients to receivemore attention than they have hitherto. The famous island of Plato of that name was but a fragment of this greatContinent. (See \"Esoteric Buddhism.\")V. The Fifth Continent was America; but, as it is situated at the Antipodes, it is Europe and Asia Minor, almost coeval withit, which are generally referred to by the Indo-Aryan Occultists as the fifth. If their teaching followed the appearance of theContinents in their geological and geographical order, then this classification would have to be altered. But as thesequence of the Continents is made to follow the order of evolution of the Races, from the first to the fifth, our AryanRoot-race, Europe must be called the fifth great Continent. The Secret Doctrine takes no account of islands andpeninsulas, nor does it follow the modern geographical distribution of land and sea. Since the day of its earliest teachingsand the destruction of the great Atlantis, the face of the earth has changed more than once. There was a time when thedelta of Egypt and Northern Africa belonged to Europe, before the formation of the Straits of Gibraltar, and a further"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"upheaval of the continent, changed entirely the face of the map of Europe. The last serious change occurred some12,000 years ago,**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is to be remarked, however, that Mr. Wallace does not accept Mr. Sclater's idea, and even opposes it. Mr. Sclatersupposes a land or continent formerly uniting Africa, Madagascar, and India (but not Australia and India); and Mr. A. R.Wallace shows, in his \"Geographical Distribution of Animals\" and \"Island Life,\" that the hypothesis of such a land is quiteuncalled for on the alleged zoological grounds. But he admits that a much closer proximity of India and Australia didcertainly exist, and at a time so very remote that it was \"certainly pre-tertiary,\" and he adds in a private letter that \"noname has been given to this supposed land.\" Yet the land did exist, and was of course pre-tertiary, for \"Lemuria\"(accepting this name for the third Continent) had perished before Atlantis had fully developed; and the latter sunk and itschief portions had disappeared before the end of the Miocene period.** One more \"coincidence\" --\"Now it is proved that in geologically recent times, this region of North Africa was in fact a peninsula of Spain, and that itsunion with Africa (proper) was effected on the North by the rupture of Gibraltar, and on the South by an upheaval to whichthe Sahara owes its existence. The shores of this former sea of Sahara are still marked by the shells [[Footnote continuedon next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 9 PRE-TERTIARY GIANTS.and was followed by the submersion of Plato's little Atlantic island, which he calls Atlantis after its parent continent.Geography was part of the mysteries, in days of old. Says the Zohar (iii., fol. 10a): \"These secrets (of land and sea) weredivulged to the men of the secret science, but not to the geographers.\"The claim that physical man was originally a colossal pre-tertiary giant, and that he existed 18,000,000 years ago, must ofcourse appear preposterous to admirers of, and believers in, modern learning. The whole posse comitatis of biologists willturn away from the conception of this third race Titan of the Secondary age, a being fit to fight as successfully with thethen gigantic monsters of the air, sea, and land, as his forefathers -- the ethereal prototype of the Atlantean -- had littleneed to fear that which could not hurt him. The modern anthropologist is quite welcome to laugh at our Titans, as helaughs at the Biblical Adam, and as the theologian laughs at his pithecoid ancestor. The Occultists and their severe criticsmay feel that they have pretty well mutually squared their accounts by this time. Occult sciences claim less and givemore, at all events, than either Darwinian Anthropology or Biblical Theology.Nor ought the Esoteric Chronology to frighten any one; for, with regard to figures, the greatest authorities of the day areas fickle and as uncertain as the Mediterranean wave. As regards the duration of the geological periods alone, thelearned men of the Royal Society are all hopelessly at sea, and jump from one million to five hundred millions of yearswith the utmost ease, as will be seen more than once during this comparison.Take one instance for our present purpose -- the calculations of Mr. Croll. Whether, according to this authority, 2,500,000years represent the time since the beginning of the tertiary age, or the Eocene period, as an American geologist makeshim say;* or whether again Mr. Croll \"allows fifteen millions since the beginning of the Eocene period,\" as quoted by anEnglish geologist,** both sets of figures cover the claims[[Footnote(s)]] ------------------------------------------------- [[Footnote continued from previous page]] of the same Gastropoda that live on the shores of the Mediterranean.\" (Prof.Oscar Schmidt, \"Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,\" p. 244.)* A. Winchell, Professor of Geology, \"World-Life,\" p. 369.** Mr. Charles Gould, late Geological surveyor of Tasmania, in \"Mythical Monsters,\" p. 84.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 10 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.made by the Secret Doctrine.* For assigning as the latter does from four to five million years between the incipient andthe final evolution of the Fourth Root-Race, on the Lemuro-Atlantean Continents; one million years for the Fifth, or AryanRace, to the present date; and about 850,000 since the submersion of the last large peninsula of the great Atlantis -- allthis may have easily taken place within the 15,000,000 years conceded by Mr. Croll to the Tertiary Age. But,chronologically speaking, the duration of the period is of secondary importance, as we have, after all, certain Americanscientists to fall back upon. These gentlemen, unmoved by the fact that their assertions are called not only dubious butabsurd, yet maintain that man existed so far back as in the Secondary Age. They have found human footprints on rocksof that formation; and furthermore, M. de Quatrefages finds no valid scientific reason why man should not have existedduring the Secondary Age.The \"Ages\" and periods in geology are, in sober truth, purely conventional terms, as they are still hardly delineated, and,moreover,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Sir Charles Lyell, who is credited with having \"happily invented the terms Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene,\" to mark thethree divisions of the Tertiary age, ought really to have settled upon some approximate age for his \"Mind-offspring.\"Having left the duration of these periods, however, to the speculations of specialists, the greatest confusion andperplexity are the result of that happy thought. It seems like a hopeless task to quote one set of figures from one work,without the risk of finding it contradicted by the same Author in an earlier or a subsequent volume. Sir W. Thomson, one"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"of the most eminent among the modern authorities, has changed, about half-a-dozen times, his opinion upon the age ofthe Sun and the date of the consolidation of the Earth's crust. In Thomson and Tait's \"Natural Philosophy,\" one finds onlyten million years allowed, since the time when the temperature of the Earth permitted vegetable life to appear on it; (App.D et seq. also Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. xxiii, Pt. 1, 157, 1862, where 847 is cancelled). Mr. Darwin gives Sir W. Thomson'sestimate as \"a minimum of 98 and a maximum of 200 millions of years since the consolidation of the crust\" (See Ch.Gould). In the same work (Nat. Phil.) 80 millions are given from the time of incipient incrustation to the present state of theworld. And in his last lecture, as shown elsewhere, Sir W. Thomson declares (1887) that the Sun is not older than 15millions of years! Meanwhile, basing his arguments as to the limits to the age of the Sun's heat, on figures previouslyestablished by Sir W. Thomson, Mr. Croll allows 60 millions of years since the beginning of the Cambrian period. This ishopeful for the lovers of exact knowledge. Thus, whatever figures are given by Occult Science, they are sure to becorroborated by those of some one among the modern men of Science who are considered as authorities.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 11 THE TROPICS AT THE POLE.no two geologists or naturalists agree as to the figures. Thus, there is a wide margin for choice offered to the Occultist bythe learned fraternity. Shall we take for one of our supports Mr. T. Mellard Reade? This gentleman, in a paper on\"Limestone as an Index of Geological Time,\" read by him in 1878 before the Royal Society, claims that the minimum timerequired for the formation of the sedimentary strata and the elimination of the calcareous matter is in round numbers 600million years (See \"Proceedings of Royal Society,\" London, Vol. XXVIII., p. 281); or shall we ask support for ourchronology from Mr. Darwin's works, wherein he demands for the organic transformations according to his theory from300 to 500 million years? Sir C. Lyell and Prof. Houghton were satisfied with placing the beginning of the Cambrian Ageat 200 and 240 millions of years back respectively. Geologists and zoologists claim the maximum time, though Mr.Huxley, at one time, placed the beginning of the incrustation of the earth 1,000 million years ago, and would not surrendera millennium of it.But the main point for us lies not in the agreement or disagreement of the Naturalists as to the duration of geologicalperiods, but rather in their perfect accord on one point, for a wonder, and this a very important one. They all agree thatduring \"The Miocene Age\" -- whether one or ten million years ago -- Greenland and even Spitzbergen, the remnants ofour Second or Hyperborean Continent, \"had almost a tropical climate.\" Now the pre-Homeric Greeks had preserved avivid tradition of this \"Land of the Eternal Sun,\" whither their Apollo journeyed yearly. \"During the Miocene Age,Greenland (in N. Lat. 70 degrees) developed an abundance of trees, such as the Yew, the Redwood, the Sequoia, alliedto the Californian species, Beeches, Planes, Willows, Oaks, Poplars and Walnuts, as well as a Magnolia and a Zamia,\"says Science; in short Greenland had Southern plants unknown to Northern regions.And now this natural question rises. If the Greeks knew, in the days of Homer, of a Hyperborean land, i.e., a blessed landbeyond the reach of Boreas, the god of winter and of the hurricane, an ideal region which the later Greeks and theirclassics have vainly tried to locate by searching for it beyond Scythia, a country where nights were short and days long,and beyond that land a country where the sun never set and the palm grew freely -- if they knew of all this, who then toldthem of it? In------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 12 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.their day, and for ages previously, Greenland must certainly have been already covered with perpetual snows, with never-thawing ice, just as it is now. Everything tends to show that the land of the short nights and the long days was Norway orScandinavia, beyond which was the blessed land of eternal light and summer; and to know of this, their tradition musthave descended to the Greeks from some people more ancient than themselves, who were acquainted with thoseclimatic details of which the Greeks themselves could know nothing. Even in our day, science suspects beyond the Polarseas, at the very circle of the Arctic Pole, the existence of a sea which never freezes and a continent which is ever green.The archaic teachings, and likewise the Puranas -- for one who understands the allegories of the latter -- contain thesame statements. Suffice, then, to us the strong probability that a people, now unknown to history, lived during theMiocene period of modern science, at a time when Greenland was an almost tropical land.-------NOTE.

The sun was the chief, exoterically, of thetwelve great gods, or zodiacal constellations; and, esoterically, the Messiah, the Christos (the subject anointed by theGreat BREATH, or the ONE) surrounded by his twelve subordinate powers, also subordinate, in turn, to each of theseven \"Mystery-gods\" of the planets.\"The seven higher make the Seven Lhas create the world,\" states a Commentary; which means that our Earth, leavingaside the rest, was created or fashioned by terrestrial spirits, the \"Regents\" being simply the supervisors. This is the firstgerm, the seed of that which grew later into the Tree of Astrology and Astrolatry. The Higher ones were theKosmocratores, the fabricators of our solar system. This is borne out by all the ancient Cosmogonies: that of Hermes, ofthe Chaldees, of the Aryans, of the Egyptians, and even of the Jews. Heaven's belt, the signs of the Zodiac (the Sacredanimals), are as much the Bne' Alhim (Sons of the Gods or the Elohim) as the Spirits of the Earth; but they are prior tothem. Soma and Sin, Isis and Diana, are all lunar gods or goddesses, called the fathers and mothers of our Earth, whichis subordinate to them. But these, in their turn, are subordinate to their \"Fathers\" and \"Mothers\" -- the latterinterchangeable and varying with each nation -- the gods and their planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn Bel, Brihaspati, etc.(c) \"His breath gave life to the seven,\" refers as much to the sun, who gives life to the Planets, as to the \"High One,\" theSpiritual Sun, who gives life to the whole Kosmos. The astronomical and astrological keys opening the gate leading to themysteries of Theogony can be found only in the later glossaries, which accompany the Stanzas.In the apocalyptic Slokas of the Archaic Records, the language is as symbolical, if less mythical, than in the Puranas.Without the help of the later commentaries, compiled by generations of adepts, it would be impossible to understand themeaning correctly. In the ancient Cosmogonies, the visible and the invisible worlds are the double links of one and thesame chain. As the invisible Logos, with its seven hierarchies (represented or personified each by its chief angel orrector), form one POWER, the inner and the invisible; so, in the world of Forms, the Sun and the seven chief Planetsconstitute the visible and active potency; the latter \"Hierarchy\" being, so to speak, the visible and objective Logos of theinvisible and (except in the lowest grades) ever-subjective angels.Thus -- to anticipate a little by way of illustration -- every Race in its------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 24 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.evolution is said to be born under the direct influence of one of the Planets: Race the first receiving its breath of life fromthe Sun, as will be seen later on; while the third humanity -- those who fell into generation, or from androgynes becameseparate entities, one male and the other female -- are said to be under the direct influence of Venus, \"the little sun inwhich the solar orb stores his light.\"The summation of the Stanzas in Book I. showed the genesis* of Gods and men taking rise in, and from, one and thesame Point, which is the One Universal, Immutable, Eternal, and absolute UNITY. In its primary manifested aspect wehave seen it become: (1) in the sphere of objectivity and Physics, Primordial Substance and Force (centripetal andcentrifugal, positive and negative, male and female, etc., etc.); (2) in the world of Metaphysics, the SPIRIT OF THEUNIVERSE, or Cosmic Ideation, called by some the LOGOS.This LOGOS is the apex of the Pythagorean triangle. When the triangle is complete it becomes the Tetraktis, or theTriangle in the Square, and is the dual symbol of the four-lettered Tetragrammaton in the manifested Kosmos, and of itsradical triple RAY in the unmanifested, or its noumenon.Put more metaphysically, the classification given here of Cosmic Ultimates, is more one of convenience than of absolutephilosophical accuracy. At the commencement of a great Manvantara, Parabrahm manifests as Mulaprakriti and then asthe Logos. This Logos is equivalent to the \"Unconscious Universal Mind,\" etc., of Western Pantheists. It constitutes theBasis of the SUBJECT-side of manifested Being, and is the source of all manifestations of individual consciousness.Mulaprakriti or Primordial Cosmic Substance, is the foundation of the OBJECT-side of things -- the basis of all objectiveevolution and Cosmogenesis. Force, then, does not emerge with Primordial Substance from Parabrahmic Latency. It isthe transformation into energy of the supra-conscious thought of the Logos, infused, so to speak, into the objectivation ofthe latter out of potential latency in the One Reality. Hence spring the wondrous laws of matter: hence the \"primalimpress\" so vainly discussed by Bishop Temple. Force thus is not synchronous with the first objectivation of Mulaprakriti.But as, apart from it, the latter is absolutely and necessarily inert -- a mere abstraction -- it is unnecessary to weave toofine a cobweb of subtleties as to the order of succession of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* According to Dr. A.

Force succeeds Mulaprakriti; but, minus Force, Mulaprakriti is for all practical intents and purposesnon-existent.*The \"Heavenly Man\" (Tetragrammaton) who is the Protogonos, Tikkoun, the firstborn from the passive deity and the firstmanifestation of that deity's shadow, is the universal form and idea, which engenders the manifested Logos, AdamKadmon, or the four-lettered symbol, in the Kabala, of the Universe itself, also called the second Logos. The secondsprings from the first and develops the third triangle (see the Sephirothal Tree); from the last of which (the lower host ofAngels) MEN are generated. It is with this third aspect that we shall deal at present.The reader must bear in mind that there is a great difference between the LOGOS and the Demiurgos, for one is Spiritand the other is Soul; or as Dr. Wilder has it: \"Dianoia and Logos are synonymous, Nous being superior and closely inaffinity with [[To agathon]], one being the superior apprehending, the other the comprehending -- one noetic and the otherphrenic.\"Moreover, Man was regarded in several systems as the third Logos. The esoteric meaning of the word Logos (speech orword, Verbum) is the rendering in objective expression, as in a photograph, of the concealed thought. The Logos is themirror reflecting DIVINE MIND, and the Universe is the mirror of the Logos, though the latter is the esse of that Universe.As the Logos reflects all in the Universe of Pleroma, so man reflects in himself all that he sees and finds in his Universe,the Earth. It is the three Heads of the Kabala: \"Unum intra alterum, et alterum super alterum\" (Zohar, Idra Suta, sec. VII).\"Every Universe (world or planet) has its own Logos,\" says the doctrine. The Sun was always called by the Egyptians \"theeye of Osiris,\" and was himself the Logos, the first-begotten, or light made manifest to the world, \"which is the Mind anddivine intellect of the Concealed.\" It is only by the sevenfold Ray of this light that we can become cognizant of the Logosthrough the Demi-urge, regarding the latter as the creator of our planet and everything pertaining to it, and the former asthe guiding Force of that \"Creator\" -- good and bad at the same time, the origin of good and the origin of evil. This\"Creator\" is neither good nor bad per se, but its differentiated aspects in nature make it assume one or the othercharacter. With the invisible and the unknown Universes disseminated through space, none of the sun-gods had anythingto do. The idea is expressed very clearly in the \"Books of Hermes,\" and in every ancient folk lore. It is symbolisedgenerally by the Dragon and the Serpent -- the Dragon of Good and the Serpent of Evil, represented on Earth by[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For a clearer explanation of the origins, as contained in the esotericism of the Bhagavad Gita, see the Notes thereonpublished in the \"Theosophist\" for February, March and June, 1887, Madras.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 26 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the right and the left-hand Magic. In the epic poem of Finland, the Kalewala,* the origin of the Serpent of Evil is given: it isborn from the \"spittle of Suoyatar . . . . and endowed with a living Soul by the Principle of Evil,\" Hisi.

Therefore it is truly declared that GautamaBuddha \"is said to have taught them a more philosophical religious system than to men, who were not sufficientlyadvanced to understand it at the time of his appearance.\" (Schlagintweit's \"Tibetan Buddhism.\")* The Mandragora is the mandrake of the Bible, of Rachel and Leah. They are the roots of a plant, fleshy, hairy, andforked below, representing roughly the limbs of a man, the body and even a head. Its magical and mysterious propertieshave been proclaimed in fable and play from the most archaic ages. From Rachel and Leah, who indulged in witchcraftwith them, down to Shakespeare, who speaks of shrieking --. . . . \"Like mandrakes torn out of the earthThat living mortals, hearing them, run mad\"-- the mandragora was the magic plant par excellence.These roots, without any stalk, and with large leaves growing out of the head of the root, like a gigantic crop of hair,present little similitude to man when found in Spain, Italy, Asia Minor, or Syria. But on the Isle of Candia, and inKaramania near the city of Adan, they have a wonderfully human form; being very highly prized as amulets. They are alsoworn by women as a charm against sterility, and for other purposes. They are especially effective in Black Magic.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 28 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.light and heat from the Sun than Earth, or even the beautiful Venus, which receives but twice that amount more than ourinsignificant Globe.\" Whether the fact was known in antiquity may be inferred from the prayer of the \"Earth Spirit\" to theSun as given in the text.* The Sun however, refuses to people the globe, as it is not ready to receive life as yet.Mercury is, as an astrological planet, still more occult and mysterious than Venus. It is identical with the Mazdean Mithra,the genius, or god, \"established between the Sun and the Moon, the perpetual companion of 'Sun' of Wisdom.\"Pausanias shows him as having an altar in common with Jupiter (Book V). He had wings to express his attendance uponthe Sun in its course; and he was called the Nuntis, or Sun-wolf, \"solaris luminis particeps.\" He was the leader of and theevocator of Souls, the \"great Magician\" and the Hierophant. Virgil depicts him as taking \"his wand to evoke from Orcusthe souls plunged therein\" -- tum virgam capit, hac animas ille evocat Orco. (See also the 21st Fargard of the Vendidadon the celestial militia.) He is the golden-coloured Mercury, the [[chrusophaes Hermes]] whom the Hierophants forbade toname. He is symbolised in Grecian mythology by one of the dogs (vigilance), which watch over the celestial flock (occultwisdom), or Hermes Anubis, or again Agathodaemon. He is the Argus watching over the Earth, and which the lattermistakes for the Sun itself. It is through the intercession of Mercury that the Emperor Julian prayed to the Occult Sunevery night; for, as says Vossius: \"All the theologians agree to say that Mercury and the Sun are one. . . . He was the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"most eloquent and the most wise of all the gods, which is not to be wondered at, since Mercury is in such close proximityto the Wisdom and the Word of God (the Sun) that he was confused with both.\" (Idolatry, Vol. II., p. 373.) Vossius uttershere a greater occult truth than he suspected. The Hermes-Sarameyas of the Greeks is closely related to the HinduSaram and Sarameya, the divine watchman, \"who watches over the golden flock of stars and solar rays.\"In the clearer words of the Commentary:\"The Globe, propelled onward by the Spirit of the Earth and his six assistants,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Copernicus wrote his theories on the \"Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies\" in the XVIth century, and the Zohar, even ifcompiled by Moses de Leon in the XIIIth century, states that: \"In the book of Hammannunah, the Old, we learn . . . thatthe earth turns upon itself in the form of a circle; that some are on top, the others below, . . . . that there are somecountries which are lightened, whilst others are in darkness; these have the day, when for the former it is night; and thereare countries in which it is constantly day, or in which at least the night continues only some instants.\" (Zohar iii., fol. 10a\"Qabbalah,\" p. 139.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 29 THE CELESTIAL GOVERNORS OF HUMANITY.gets all its vital forces, life, and powers through the medium of the seven planetary Dhyanis from the Spirit of the Sun.They are his messengers of Light and Life.\"\"Like each of the seven regions of the Earth, each of the seven* Firstborn (the primordial human groups) receives its lightand life from its own especial Dhyani -- spiritually, and from the palace (house, the planet) of that Dhyani physically; sowith the seven great Races to be born on it. The first is born under the Sun; the second under Brihaspati (Jupiter); thethird under Lohitanga (the \"fiery-bodied,\" Venus, or Sukra); the fourth, under Soma (the Moon, our Globe also, the FourthSphere being born under and from the Moon) and Sani, Saturn** the Krura-lochana (evil-eyed) and the Asita (the dark);the fifth, under Budha (Mercury).\"\"So also with man and every 'man' in man (every principle). Each gets its specific quality from its primary (the planetaryspirit), therefore every man is a septenate (or a combination of principles, each having its origin in a quality of that specialDhyani). Every active power or force of the earth comes to her from one of the seven Lords. Light comes through Sukra(Venus), who receives a triple supply, and gives one-third of it to the Earth. Therefore the two are called 'Twin-sisters,' butthe Spirit of the Earth is subservient to the 'Lord' of Sukra. Our wise men represent the two Globes, one over, the otherunder the double Sign (the primeval Svastica bereft of its four arms, or the cross [[diagram]]).\"***The \"double sign\" is, as every student of Occultism knows, the symbol of the male and the female principles in Nature, ofthe positive and the negative, for the Svastica or [[diagram]] is all that and much more. All antiquity, ever since the birth ofAstronomy -- imparted to the Fourth Race by one of its divine kings of the Divine Dynasty -- and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Science teaches that Venus receives from the sun twice as much light and heat as the earth. Thus the planet, precursorof the dawn and the twilight, the most radiant of all the planets, said to give the earth one-third of the supply she receives,has two parts left for herself. This has an occult as well as an astronomical meaning.** \"As it is above so it is below\" is the fundamental axiom of occult philosophy. As the logos is seven-fold, i.e., throughoutKosmos it appears as seven logoi under seven different forms, or, as taught by learned Brahmins, \"each of these is thecentral figure of one of the seven main branches of the ancient wisdom religion;\" and, as the seven principles whichcorrespond to the seven distinct states of Pragna, or consciousness, are allied to seven states of matter and the sevenforms of force, the division must be the same in all that concerns the earth.*** Venus is thus [[diagram]] the Earth [[diagram]].------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 30 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.also of Astrology, represented Venus in its astronomical tables as a Globe poised over a Cross, and the Earth, as aGlobe under a Cross. The esoteric meaning of this is: \"Earth fallen into generation, or into the production of its speciesthrough sexual union.\" But the later Western nations did not fail to give quite a different interpretation. They explained thissign through their mystics -- guided by the light of the Latin Church -- as meaning that our Earth and all on it wereredeemed by the Cross, while Venus (otherwise Lucifer or Satan) was trampling upon it. Venus is the most occult,powerful, and mysterious of all the planets; the one whose influence upon, and relation to the Earth is most prominent. Inexoteric Brahmanism, Venus or Sukra -- a male deity* -- is the son of Bhrigu, one of the Prajapati and a Vedic sage, andis Daitya-Guru, or the priest-instructor of the primeval giants. The whole history of \"Sukra\" in the Puranas, refers to theThird and to the Fourth Races.\"It is through Sukra that the 'double ones' (the Hermaphrodites) of the Third (Root-Race) descended from the first 'Sweat-born,'\" says the Commentary. Therefore it is represented under the symbol of [[diagram]] (the circle and diameter) duringthe Third (Race) and of [[diagram]] during the Fourth.This needs explanation. The diameter, when found isolated in a circle, stands for female nature, for the first ideal World,self-generated and self-impregnated by the universally diffused Spirit of Life -- referring thus to the primitive Root-Racealso. It becomes androgynous as the Races and all on Earth develop into their physical forms, and the symbol istransformed into a circle with a diameter from which runs a vertical line: expressive of male and female, not separated asyet -- the first and earliest Egyptian Tau [[diagram]]; after which it becomes [[diagram]] or male-female separated** (See"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"first pp. of Book I) and fallen into generation. Venus (the planet) is symbolised by the sign of a globe over the cross,which shows it as presiding over the natural generation of man. The Egyptians symbolised Ank, \"life,\" by the ansatedcross, or [[diagram]], which is only another form of Venus (Isis) [[diagram]], and meant, esoterically, that mankind and allanimal life bad stepped out of the divine spiritual circle and fallen into physical male and female generation. This sign,from the end of the Third Race, has the same phallic significance as the \"tree[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the esoteric philosophy it is male and female, or hermaphrodite; hence the bearded Venus in mythology.** Therefore, putting aside its religio-metaphysical aspect, the Cross of the Christians is symbolically far more phallic thanthe pagan Svastica.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 31 THE HORSES OF SUKRA'S CAR.of life\" in Eden Anouki, a form of Isis, is the goddess of life; and Ank was taken by the Hebrews from the Egyptians andintroduced by Moses, one learned in the Wisdom of the priests of Egypt, with many other mystical words. The word Ankin Hebrew, with the personal suffix, means \"my life,\" my being, which \"is the personal pronoun Anochi,\" from the name ofthe Egyptian goddess Anouki.*In one of the most ancient Catechisms of Southern India, Madras Presidency, the hermaphrodite goddess Adanari (seealso \"Indian Pantheon\") has the ansated cross, the Svastica, the \"male and female sign,\" right in the central part, todenote the pre-sexual state of the Third Race. Vishnu, who is now represented with a lotus growing out of his navel -- orthe Universe of Brahma evolving out of the central point Nara -- is shown in one of the oldest carvings as double-sexed(Vishnu and Lakshmi) standing on a lotus-leaf floating on the water; which water rises in a semicircle and pours throughthe Svastica, \"the source of generation\" or of the descent of man.Pythagoras calls Sukra-Venus the Sol alter, \"the other Sun.\" Of the \"seven palaces of the Sun,\" that of Lucifer Venus isthe third one in Christian and Jewish Kabala, the Zohar making of it the abode of Samael. According to the OccultDoctrine, this planet is our Earth's primary, and its spiritual prototype. Hence, Sukra's car (Venus-Lucifer's) is said to bedrawn by an ogdoad of \"earth-born horses,\" while the steeds of the chariots of the other planets are different.\"Every sin committed on Earth is felt by Usanas-Sukra. The Guru of the Daityas is the Guardian Spirit of the Earth andMen. Every change on Sukra is felt on, and reflected by, the Earth.\"Sukra, or Venus, is thus represented as the preceptor of the Daityas, the giants of the Fourth Race, who, in the Hinduallegory, obtained at one time the sovereignty of all the Earth, and defeated the minor gods. The Titans of the Westernallegory are as closely connected with Venus-Lucifer, identified by later Christians with Satan. Therefore, as Venus,equally with Isis, was represented with Cow's horns on her head, the symbol of mystic Nature, and one that is convertiblewith, and significant of, the moon, since all these were lunar goddesses, the configuration of this planet is now placed bytheologians between the horns of the mystic Lucifer.** It is owing to the fanciful interpretation of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The ansated Cross is the astronomical planetary sign of Venus, \"signifying the existence of parturient energy in thesexual sense, and this was one of the attributes of Isis, the Mother, of Eve, Hauvah, or Mother-Earth, and was sorecognised among all the ancient peoples in one or another mode of expression.\" (From a modern Kabalistic MS.)** Athenaeus shows that the first letter of Satan's name was represented in days of old by an arc and crescent; and someRoman Catholics, good and kind men, would persuade the public that it is in honour of Lucifer's crescent-like horns thatMussulmen [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 32 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.archaic tradition, which states that Venus changes simultaneously (geologically) with the Earth; that whatever takes placeon the one takes place on the other; and that many and great were their common changes -- it is for these reasons thatSt. Augustine repeats it, applying the several changes of configuration, colour, and even of the orbital paths, to thattheologically-woven character of Venus-Lucifer. He even goes so far in his pious fancy as to connect the last changes ofthe planet with the Noachian and mythical Deluge alleged to have taken place 1796 years B.C. (See \"City of God\" lxxi.,ch. viii.).As Venus has no satellites, it is stated allegorically, that \"Asphujit\" (this \"planet\") adopted the Earth, the progeny of theMoon, \"who overgrew its parent and gave much trouble,\" a reference to the occult connection between the two. TheRegent (of the planet) Sukra* loved his adopted child so well that he incarnated as Usanas and gave it perfect laws,which were disregarded and rejected in later ages. Another allegory, in Harivansa, is that Sukra went to Siva asking himto protect his pupils, the Daityas and Asuras, from the fighting gods; and that to further his object he performed a Yogarite \"imbibing the smoke of chaff with his head downwards for 1,000 years.\" This refers to the great inclination of the axisof Venus (amounting to 50 degrees), and to its being enveloped in eternal clouds. But it relates only to the physicalconstitution of the planet. It is with its Regent, the informing Dhyan Chohan,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] have chosen the Crescent for their national arms. Venus has always beenidentified, since the establishment of Roman Catholic dogmatism, with Satan and Lucifer, or the great Dragon, contrary toall reason and logic.

The position which the constellation of Draco at one time occupied showed"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"that the great serpent was the ruler of the night.

OnlyDupuis never knew why Draco, once the pole-star -- the symbol of \"Guide,\" Guru and director -- had been thus degradedby posterity. \"The gods of our fathers are our devils,\" says an Asiatic proverb. When Draco ceased to be the lode-star, theguiding sidereal divinity, it shared the fate of all the fallen gods.

The allegory which states that for killing Sukra's mother, Vishnu was cursed by him tobe reborn seven times on the Earth, is full of occult philosophical meaning. It does not refer to Vishnu's Avatars, sincethese number nine, the tenth being still to come, but to the Races on Earth. Venus, or Lucifer (also Sukra and Usanas)the planet, is the light-bearer of our Earth, in both its physical and mystic sense. The Christians knew it well in early times,since one of the earliest popes of Rome is known by his Pontiff name as Lucifer.\"Every world has its parent star and sister planet. Thus Earth is the adopted child and younger brother of Venus, but itsinhabitants are of their own kind. . . .

Why? Eachseparate people has given a different explanation, according to the peculiar tenets of their (exoteric) religion. That it wasthe number of numbers for those initiated into the sacred mysteries, there can be no doubt. Pythagoras . . . calls it the'Vehicle of Life' containing body and soul, since it is formed of a Quaternary, that is Wisdom and intellect, and of a Trinityor action and matter. The Emperor Julian, 'In matrem, etc.,' expresses himself thus: 'Were I to touch upon the initiationinto our Sacred Mysteries, which the Chaldees Bacchized, respecting the seven-rayed god, lighting up the soul throughhim, I should say things unknown to the rabble, very unknown, but well known to the blessed Theurgists.' \" (p. 141).And who, acquainted with the Puranas, the Book of the Dead, the Zendavesta, the Assyrian tiles, and finally the Bible,and who has observed the constant occurrence of the number seven, in these records of people living from the remotesttimes unconnected and so far apart, can regard as a coincidence the following fact, given by the same explorer of ancientMysteries? Speaking of the prevalence of seven as a mystic number, among the inhabitants of the \"Western continent\"(of America), he adds that it is not less remarkable. For:--\"It frequently occurs in the Popul-vuh . . . we find it besides in the seven families said by Sahagun and Clavigero to haveaccompanied the mystical personage named Votan, the reputed founder of the great city of Nachan, identified by somewith Palenque. In the seven caves* from which the ancestors of the Nahuatl are reported to have emerged. In the sevencities of Cibola, described by Coronado and Niza. . . . In the seven Antilles; in the seven heroes who, we are told,escaped the Deluge . . . .\"\"Heroes,\" moreover, whose number is found the same in every \"Deluge\" story -- from the seven Rishis who were savedwith Vaivasvata Manu, down to Noah's ark, into which beasts, fowls, and living creatures were taken by \"Sevens.\" Thuswe see the figures 1, 3, 5, 7, as perfect, because thoroughly mystic, numbers playing a prominent part in everyCosmogony and evolution of living Beings. In China, 1, 3, 5, 7, are called \"celestial numbers\" in the canonical \"Book ofChanges.\" (Yi King, or transformation, as in \"Evolution\").The explanation of it becomes evident when one examines the ancient[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] seems to believe and to seek to prove that the esoteric learning of the Aryansand the Egyptians was derived from the Mayas. But, although certainly coeval with Plato's Atlantis, the Mayas belongedto the Fifth Continent, which was preceded by Atlantis and Lemuria.* These seven caves, seven cities, etc., etc., stand in every case for the seven centres, or zones, upon which the sevenprimitive groups of the first Root-race were born.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 36 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Symbols: all these are based upon and start from the figures given from the Archaic Manuscript in the proem of Book I.[[diagram]], the symbol of evolution and fall into generation or matter, is reflected in the old Mexican sculptures orpaintings, as it is in the Kabalistic Sephiroth, and the Egyptian Tau. Examine the Mexican MSS (Add. MSS. Brit. Mus.9789)*; you will find in it a tree whose trunk is covered with ten fruits ready to be plucked by a male and female, one oneach side of it, while from the top of the trunk two branches shoot horizontally to the right and left, thus forming a perfect[[diagram]] (tau), the ends of the two branches, moreover, each bearing a triple bunch, with a bird -- the bird ofimmortality, Atman or the divine Spirit -- sitting between the two, and thus making the seventh. This represents the sameidea as the Sephirothal Tree, ten in all, yet, when separated from its upper triad, leaving Seven. These are the celestialfruits, the ten or [[diagram]] 10, born out of the two invisible male and female seeds, making up the 12, or theDodecahedron of the Universe. The mystic system contains the [[diagram]], the central point; the 3 or [[diagram]]; the five,[[diagram]], and the seven or [[diagram]], or again [[diagram]]; the triangle in the square and the synthesizing point in theinterlaced double triangles.

In the Kabala, which explains the secret meaning of Genesis, this light is the DUAL-MAN, or theAndrogyne (rather the sexless) angels, whose generic name is ADAM KADMON. It is they who complete man, whoseethereal form is emanated by other divine, but far lower beings, who solidify the body with clay, or the \"dust of the ground\"-- an allegory indeed, but as scientific as any Darwinian evolution and more true.The author of the \"Source of Measures\" says that the foundation of the Kabala and all its mystic books is made to restupon the ten Sephiroth; which is a fundamental truth.* He shows these ten Sephiroth or the ten numbers in the followingdiagram:--[[diagram]]wherein the circle is the naught, its vertical diameter line is the first or primal ONE (the Word or Logos), from whichsprings the series of the other numbers up to 9, the limit of the digits. The 10 is the first Divine Manifestation** containing\"every possible power of exact expression of proportion.\" By this Kabalistic speculation we are taught that the Sephiroth\"were the numbers or emanations of the Heavenly Light (figures 20612 to 6561), they were the 10 'Words,' DBRIM,41224, the light, of which they were the flux, was the Heavenly Man, the Adam KDM (the 144- 144); and the Light, by theNew Testament or Covenant (or 41224) created God; just as, by the Old Testament God (Alhim, 31415) creates light(20612 to 6561).\"Now there are three kinds of light in Occultism, as in the Kabala. (1) The Abstract and Absolute Light, which is Darkness;(2) The Light of the Manifested-Unmanifested, called by some the Logos; and (3) The latter light reflected in the DhyanChohans, the minor logoi (the Elohim, collectively), who, in their turn, shed it on the objective Universe. But in the Kabala-- re-edited and carefully adjusted to fit the Christian tenets by the Kabalists of the XIII. century -- the three lights aredescribed as:-- (1) The clear and penetrating, that of Jehovah; (2) reflected light; and (3) light in the abstract.\" This lightabstractly taken (in a metaphysical or symbolical sense) is Alhim (Elohim God),[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Masonic Review,\" Cincinnati, June 1886, Art.

The light of Alhim belongs to the world in general, in its allness and generalfulness, but the light of Jehovah is that pertaining to the chiefest production, man, whom this light penetrated and made.\"The author of the \"Source of Measures\" pertinently refers the reader to Inman's \"Ancient Faiths embodied in AncientNames,\" vol. ii., p. 648. There, an engraving of \"the vesica piscis, Mary and the female emblem, copied from a rosary ofthe blessed Virgin . . . . printed at Venice, 1542,\" and therefore, as Inman remarks, \"with a license from the Inquisition,consequently orthodox,\" will show the reader what the Latin Church understood by this \"penetrating power of light and itseffects \" How sadly disfigured -- applied as they were to the grossest anthropomorphic conceptions -- have become,under Christian interpretation, the noblest and grandest, as the most exalted, ideas of deity of the Eastern philosophy!The Occultists call this light Daiviprakriti in the East, and light of Christos in the West. It is the light of the LOGOS, thedirect reflection of the ever Unknowable on the plane of Universal manifestation. But here is the interpretation thereofgiven by the modern Christians from the Kabala. As declared by the author just cited:--\"To the fulness of the world in general with its chiefest content, man, the term Elohim-Jehovah applies. In extracts fromthe Zohar, the Rev. Dr. Cassell (a Kabalist), to prove that the Cabbalah sets forth the doctrine of the Trinity, among otherthings says: 'Jehovah is Elohim (Alhim) . . . by three steps God (Alhim), and Jehovah become the same, and thoughseparated each and together, they are of the same one.'\" Similarly, Vishnu becomes the Sun, the visible symbol of theimpersonal deity. Vishnu is described as \"striding through the seven regions of the Universe in three steps.\" But with theHindus this is an exoteric account, a surface tenet and an allegory, while the Kabalists give it out as the esoteric and finalmeaning. But to proceed:--"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"\"Now light,\" explains the author, \"as shown, is 20612 to 6561, as the proper enunciation of the integral and numericalrelation of diameter to circumference of a circle. God (Alhim, i.e., 3.1415 to one, a modified form of the above) is thereduction of this, so as to obtain a standard unitone, as the basis, in general, of all calculation and all mensuration. But,for the production of animal life, and for especial time measure or the lunar year, that influence which causes conceptionand embryotic development, the numbers of the Jehovah measure ('man even Jehovah' measure), viz. 113 to 355, haveto be specialised.* But this last ratio is but a modified form of light or 20612 to 6561, as a '[[pi]]' value, being only avariation of the same (that is 20612 to 6561 is 31415 to one, or Alhim or God) -- and in such a manner that one can bemade[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Source of Measures,\" pp. 276, et seq. App. VII.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 39 THE NUMBERS OF CREATION.to flow into and be derived from the other, and these are the three steps by which the Unity and sameness can be shownof the divine names. That is, the two are but variations of the same ratio, viz., that of '[[pi]].' The object of this comment isto show the same measuring use for the Cabbalah as was employed in the three Covenants of the Bible, and in thesymbols of Masonry, as just noticed.\"\"First then, the Sephiroth are described as Light, that is, they themselves are a function of, indeed, the same as, themanifestation of Ain Soph; and they are so from the fact that Light represents the ratio of 20612 to 6561, as part of the'Words,' DBRIM, 41224, or as to the Word, Debar, 206 (= 10 cubits). Light is so much the burden of the Kabbalah, inexplaining the Sephiroth, that the most famous book on the Kabbalah is called Zohar or Light. In this we find expressionsof this kind:-- 'The Infinite was entirely unknown and diffused no light before the luminous point violently broke throughinto vision . . . .' 'When he first assumed the form (of the Crown, or the first Sephira), he caused 9 splendid lights toemanate from it, which, shining through it, diffused a bright light in all directions': that is, these 9 with his one (which wasthe origin, as above, of the nine), together made the 10, that is [[diagram]] or [[diagram]], or the sacred Ten (numbers orSephiroth), or Jod -- and these numbers were 'the Light.' Just as in the Gospel of St. John, God (Alhim, 31415 to one)was that light (20612 to 6561) by which (Light) all things were made.\"In Sepher Jezirah, or Numbers of Creation, the whole process of evolution is given out in Numbers. In its \"32 paths ofWisdom\" the number 3 is repeated four times, and the number 4 five times. Therefore, the Wisdom of God is contained innumbers (Sephrim or Sephiroth), for Sepher (or S-ph-ra when unvowelled) means \"to cipher.\" And therefore, also, we findPlato stating that the deity geometrizes in fabricating the Universe.The Kabalistic book, the Sepher Jezirah, opens with a statement of the hidden wisdom of Alhi in Sephrim, i.e, the Elohimin the Sephiroth.\"In thirty and two paths, hidden wisdom, established Jah, JHVH, Tzabaoth, Elohi of Israel, Alhim of Life, El of Grace andMercy -- exalted, uplifted Dweller on high, and King of Everlasting, and his name -- Holy! in three Sephrim: viz:-- B-S'ph-r,V-S'ph-r, V-Siph-o-r.\"\"This Comment sets forth 'the Hidden Wisdom' of the original text by hidden Wisdom, that is, by the use of words carryinga special set of Numbers and a special phraseology, which will set forth the very explanatory system which we find to fitso accurately in the Hebrew Bible. . . . . In setting forth his scheme, to enforce it, and to finish out his detailed expositionin a general postulate, viz., the one word------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 40 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Sephrim (Sephiroth) of the Number Jezirah, the author explains the separation of this word in the three subordinate ones,a play upon a common word s-ph-r, or number.\"The prince Al-Chazari says to the Rabbi*:-- \"I wish now that thou wouldest impart to me some of the chiefest or leadingprinciples of Natural Philosophy, which as thou sayest were in former times worked out by them (the Ancient WiseOnes)\"; to which the Rabbi makes answer:-- \"To such principles appertains the Number of Creation of our Race-fatherAbraham\" (that is Abram and Abraham, or numbers 41224 and 41252). He then says that this book of Number treats ofteaching the Alhim-ness and One-ness through, \"DBRIM,\" viz., the numbers of the Word \"Words.\" That is, it teaches theuse of the ratio 31415 to one, through 41224, which last, in the description of the Ark of the Covenant, was divided intotwo parts by two tables of stone, on which these, DBRIM or 41224, were written or engraved -- or 20612 by 2. He thencomments on these three subordinately used words, and takes care as to one of them to make the comment:-- \"AndAlhim (31415 to 1) said: Let there be Light (20612 to 6561).\"The three words as given in the text are: [[hebrew]]. And the Rabbi in commenting upon them says: \"It teaches the Alhim-ness (31415) and One-ness (the diameter to Alhim) through Words (DBRIM, 41224), by which on the one side there isinfinite expression in heterogeneous creations, and on the other a final harmonic tendency to One-ness\" (which aseveryone knows is the mathematical function of \"[[pi]]\" of the schools, which measures, and weighs and numbers thestars of heaven, and yet resolves them back into the final Oneness of the Universe through Words). \"Their final accordperfects itself in that Oneness that ordains them and which consists in [[hebrew]] (Book of Al-Chazari), that is the Rabbi,in his first comment, leaves the jod, or i, out of one of the words, whereas afterwards he restores it again. If we take thevalues of those subordinate words, we find them to be 340, 340, 346; together these are 1026, and the division of thegeneral word into these has been to produce these numbers, which by Temurah may be changed in various ways forvarious purposes.\" (Kabala.)"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The reader is asked to turn to Stanza IV. of Book I. and its fourth commentary to find that the 3, 4 -- (7), and the thriceseven, or 1065, the number of Jehovah, is the number of the 21 Prajapati mentioned in the Mahabharata, or the threeSephrim (words in cipher or figures).

(See Book I, Part 2, \"Deus Lunus.\") It is a fact well known to every conscientious student of the Kabala,that the deeper he dives into it, the more he feels convinced that unless the Kabala -- or what is left of it -- is read by thelight of the Eastern esoteric philosophy, its study leads only to the discovery that, on the lines traced by exoteric Judaismand Christianity, the monotheism of both is nothing more exalted than ancient Astrolatry, now vindicated by modernAstronomy. The Kabalists never cease to repeat that primal intelligence can never be understood. It cannot becomprehended, nor can it be located, therefore it has to remain nameless and negative. Hence the Ain-Soph -- the\"UNKNOWABLE\" and the \"UNNAMEABLE\" -- which, as it could not be made manifest, was conceived to emanatemanifesting Powers. It is then with its emanations alone that human intellect has to, and can deal. Christian theology,having rejected the doctrine of emanations and replaced them with direct, conscious creations of angels and the rest outof nothing, now finds itself hopelessly stranded between Supernaturalism, or miracle, and materialism. An extra-cosmicgod is fatal to philosophy, an intra-cosmic Deity -- i.e. Spirit and matter inseparable from each other -- is a philosophicalnecessity. Separate them and that which is left is a gross superstition under a mask of emotionalism. But why\"geometrize,\" as Plato has it, why represent these emanations under the form of an immense arithmetical table? Thequestion is well answered by the author just cited. His remarks are quoted in Part II., § \"The Theogony of the CreativeGods.\"\"Mental perception,\" he says, \"to become physical perception, must have the Cosmic principle of light: and by this, ourmental circle must become visible through light; or, for its complete manifestation, the Circle must be that of physicalvisibility, or Light itself. Such conceptions, thus formulated, became the groundwork of the philosophy of the divinemanifesting in the Universe.\"This is philosophy. It is otherwise when we find the Rabbi in Al-Chazari saying that \"under s'ph-r is to be understoodcalculation and weighing of created bodies. For the calculation, by means of which a body must be constructed inharmony or symmetry, by which it must be in construction rightly arranged and made to correspond to the object indesign, consists at last in number, extension, mass, weight; co-ordinate relation of movements, then harmony of music,must consist altogether by number, that is (S'ph-r). . . By Sippor (s'phor) is to be understood the words of Alhimwhereunto joins or adapts itself the design of the frame or form of construction; for example, it was said 'Let Light be.' Thework became as the WORDS were spoken, that is, as the numbers of the work came forth. . . . .\"This is materialising the Spiritual without scruple. But the Kabala------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 42 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.was not always so well adapted to anthropo-monotheistic conceptions. Compare this with any of the six schools of India.For instance, in Kapila's \"Sankhya\" Philosophy, unless, allegorically speaking, Purusha mounts on the shoulders ofPrakriti, the latter remains irrational, while the former remains inactive without her. Therefore Nature (in man) mustbecome a compound of Spirit and Matter before he becomes what he is; and the Spirit latent in Matter must be awakenedto life and consciousness gradually. The Monad has to pass through its mineral, vegetable and animal forms, before theLight of the Logos is awakened in the animal man. Therefore, till then, the latter cannot be referred to as \"MAN,\" but hasto be regarded as a Monad imprisoned in ever changing forms. Evolution, not creation, by means of WORDS isrecognized in the philosophies of the East, even in their exoteric records. Ex oriente lux. Even the name of the first man inthe Mosaic Bible had its origin in India, Professor Max Muller's negation notwithstanding. The Jews got their Adam fromChaldea; and Adam-Adami is a compound word and therefore a manifold symbol, and proves the occult dogmas.This is no place for philological disquisitions. But the reader may be reminded that the words Ad and Adi mean in Sanskrit\"the first\"; in Aramaean, \"One\" (Ad-ad, \"the only one\"); in Assyrian, \"father\" whence Ak-Ad or \"father-creator.\"* And oncethe statement is found correct it becomes rather difficult to confine Adam to the Mosaic Bible alone, and to see thereinsimply a Jewish name. Vide Part II. of this Volume, § \"Adam-Adami.\"There is frequent confusion in the attributes and genealogies of the gods in their theogonies, as given to the world by thehalf-initiated writers, Brahmanical and Biblical, the Alpha and the Omega of the records of that symbolical science. Yetthere could be no such confusion made by the earliest nations, the descendants and pupils of the divine instructors: forboth the attributes and the genealogies were inseparably linked with cosmogonical symbols, the \"gods\" being the life andanimating \"soul-principle\" of the various regions of the Universe. Nowhere and by no people was speculation allowed torange beyond those manifested gods. The boundless and infinite UNITY remained with every nation a virgin forbiddensoil, untrodden by man's thought,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The appellation Ak-ad (or Akkadians) is of the same class as Ad-m, Ha-va (Eve), AEd-en (Eden); Ak-Ad meaning \"Sonof Ad\" (like the sons of Ad in Ancient Arabia). Ad-ad, the \"Only One\" and the First, was the Ad-on or \"Lord\" of Syria andconsort of Ad-ar-gat or Aster't, the Syrian goddess. And Gan-AEden (Eden) or Gandunia was Babylonia andMesopotamia. In Assyrian Ak meant Creator, the letter K pronounced Kh (Ah) gutturally. According to Swedenborg's"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"mysticism Adam was not a man but a church (?) of primitive light. In the Vedas Ad-iti is the primitive light, the Akasa ofthe phenomenal world.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 43 ADAM-ADAMI.untouched by fruitless speculation. The only reference made to it was the brief conception of its diastolic and systolicproperty, of its periodical expansion or dilatation, and contraction. In the Universe with all its incalculable myriads ofsystems and worlds disappearing and re-appearing in eternity, the anthropomorphised powers, or gods, their Souls, hadto disappear from view with their bodies:-- \"The breath returning to the eternal bosom which exhales and inhales them,\"says our Catechism.\"Ideal nature,\" the abstract Space in which everything in the Universe is mysteriously and invisibly generated, is the samefemale side of procreative power in Nature in the Vedic as in every other Cosmogony. Aditi is Sephira, and the Sophia-Achamoth of the Gnostics, and Isis, the virgin Mother of Horus. In every Cosmogony, behind and higher than the creativedeity, there is a superior deity, a planner, an Architect, of whom the Creator is but the executive agent. And still higher,over and around, within and without, there is the UNKNOWABLE and the unknown, the Source and Cause of all theseEmanations. . . . .It thus becomes easy to account for the reason why \"Adam-Adami\" is found in the Chaldean scripture, certainly earlierthan the Mosaic Books. In Assyrian Ad is the father, and in Aramaean Ad is \"One,\" and Ad-ad the \"only one,\" while Ak isin Assyrian \"creator.\" Thus Ad-am-ak-ad-mon became Adam Kadmon in the Kabala (Zohar), meaning as it did, the \"One(Son) of the divine Father, or the creator,\" for the words \"am\" and \"om\" meant at one time in nearly every language thedivine, or the deity. Thus Adam Kadmon and Adam-Adami came to mean:-- \"The first emanation of the Father-Mother ordivine nature,\" and literally \"the first divine one.\" And it is easy to see that Ad-Argat (or Aster't, the Syrian goddess, theconsort of Ad-on, the lord god of Syria or the Jewish Adonai), and Venus, Isis, Ishtar, Mylitta, Eve, etc., etc., are identicalwith the Aditi and Vach of the Hindus. They are all the \"Mothers of all living\" and \"of the gods.\" On the other hand --cosmically and astronomically -- all the male gods became at first \"Sun-gods,\" then, theologically, the \"Suns ofRighteousness\" and the Logoi, all symbolised by the Sun.* They are all Protogonoi (the first-born) and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Adam-Jehovah, Brahma and Mars are, in one sense, identical; they are all symbols for primitive or initial generativepowers for the purposes of human procreation. Adam is red, and so also are Brahma-Viraj and Mars -- god and planet.Water is the blood of the Earth; therefore, all these names are connected with Earth and Water. \"It takes earth and waterto create a human soul,\" says Moses. Mars is identical with Kartikeya God of War (in one sense) -- which god is born ofthe Sweat of Siva, Siva Gharmaja and the Earth. In the Mahabharata he is shown as born without the intervention of awoman. And he is also called \"Lohita,\" the red, like Adam, and the other \"first men.\" Hence, the author of \"The Source ofMeasures\" is quite right in thinking that Mars (and all the other gods of like attributes), \"being the god of war and of[[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 44 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Mikroprosopoi. With the Jews Adam Kadmon was the same as Athamaz, Tamaz, or the Adonis of the Greeks -- \"the Onewith, and of his father\" -- the \"Father\" becoming during the later Races Helios, the Sun, as Apollo Karneios,* for instance,who was the \"Sun born\"; Osiris, Ormazd, and so on, were all followed by, and found themselves transformed later on intostill more earthly types: such as Prometheus, the crucified of Mount Kajbee, Hercules, and so many others, sun-gods andheroes, until all of them came to have no better significance than phallic symbols.In the Zohar is it said \"Man was created by the Sephiroth (Elohim-Javeh, also) and they engendered by common powerthe earthly Adam.\" Therefore in Genesis the Elohim say:-- \"Behold Man is become as one of us.\" But in HinduCosmogony or \"Creation,\" Brahma-Prajapati creates Viraj and the Rishis, spiritually; therefore the latter are distinctlycalled \"the Mind-born Sons of Brahma\"; and this specified mode of engendering precluded every idea of Phallicism, atany rate in the earlier human nations. This instance well illustrates the respective spirituality of the two nations.-------3.

Such is the common belief of those who credit every star or planet withbeing inhabited. (And there are men of science -- M. Flammarion among others -- who believe in this fervently, on logicalas well as on astronomical data). The Moon being an inferior body to the Earth even, to say nothing of other planets, theterrestrial men produced by her sons -- the lunar men or \"ancestors\" -- from her shell or body, cannot be immortal. Theycannot hope to become real, self-conscious and intelligent men, unless they are finished, so to say, by other creators.Thus in the Puranic legend, the son of the Moon (Soma) is Budha (Mercury), \"the intelligent\" and the Wise, because he isthe offspring of Soma, the \"regent\" of the visible Moon, not of Indu, the physical Moon. Thus Mercury is the elder brotherof the Earth, metaphorically -- his step-brother, so to say, the offspring of Spirit -- while she (the Earth) is the progeny ofthe body. These allegories have a deeper and more scientific meaning (astronomically and geologically) then our modernphysicists are willing to admit. The whole cycle of the \"first War in Heaven,\" the Taraka-maya, is as full of philosophical asof Cosmogonical and astronomical truths. One can trace therein the biographies of all the planets by the history of theirgods and rulers. Usanas (Sukra, or Venus), the bosom-friend of Soma and the foe of Brihaspati (Jupiter) the instructor ofthe gods, whose wife Tara (or Taraka) had been carried away by the Moon, Soma -- \"of whom he begat Budha\" -- tookalso an active part in this war against \"the gods\" and forthwith was degraded into a demon (Asura) deity, and so heremains to this day.*Here the word \"men\" refers to the celestial men, or what are called in India the PITAR or pitris, the Fathers, theprogenitors of men. This[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Usanas-Sukra or Venus is our \"Lucifer,\" the morning star, of course. The ingenuity of this allegory in its manifoldmeanings is great indeed. Thus Brihaspati (the planet Jupiter) or Brahmanaspati is, in the Rig Veda, a deity who is thesymbol and the prototype of the exoteric or ritualistic worship. He is priest sacrificer, suppliant, and the medium throughwhich the prayers of mortals reach the gods. He is the Purohita (family priest, or Court Chaplain) of the Hindu Olympusand the spiritual Guru of the Gods. Soma is the mystery god and presides over the mystic and occult nature in man andthe Universe. Tara, the priest's wife, who symbolizes the worshipper, prefers esoteric truths to their mere shell,exotericism; hence she is shown as carried off by Soma. Now Soma is the sacred juice of that name, giving mysticvisions and trance revelations, the result of which union is Budha (Wisdom), Mercury, Hermes, etc., etc.; that science inshort which to this day is proclaimed by the Brihaspatis of Theology as devilish and Satanic. What wonder that byexpanding the cycle of this allegory we find Christian theology espousing the quarrel of the Hindu gods, and regardingUsanas (Lucifer), who helped Soma against that ancient personification of ritualistic worship (Brahmanaspati, the lord ofthe Brahmans, now become \"Jupiter-Jehovah\") as SATAN, the \"enemy of God\"!------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 46 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.does not remove the seeming difficulty, in view of modern hypotheses, of the teaching, which shows these progenitors orancestors creating the first human Adams out of their sides: as astral shadows. And though it is an improvement onAdam's rib, still geological and climatic difficulties will be brought forward. Such, however, is the teaching of Occultism.(c) Man's organism was adapted in every race to its surroundings. The first Root-Race was as ethereal as ours ismaterial. The progeny of the seven Creators, who evolved the seven primordial Adams,* surely required no purified gasesto breathe and live upon (see Part III. of this Volume). Therefore, however strongly the impossibility of this teaching maybe urged by the devotees of modern science, the Occultist maintains that the case was as stated aeons of years beforeeven the evolution of the Lemurian, the first physical man, which itself took place 18,000,000 years ago.**Preliminary evolution is described in one of the BOOKS OF DZYAN and the Commentaries thereon in this wise:--Archaic Scripture teaches that at the commencement of every local Kalpa, or Round, the earth is reborn; \"as the humanJiva (monad), when passing into a new womb, gets re-covered with a new body, so does the Jiva of the Earth; it gets amore perfect and solid covering with each Round after re-emerging once more from the matrix of space into objectivity\"(Comment). This process is attended, of course, by the throes of the new birth or geological convulsions.Thus the only reference to it is contained in one verse of the volume of the Book of Dzyan before us, where it says:--------4. AND AFTER GREAT THROES SHE (the Earth) CAST OFF HER OLD THREE AND PUT ON HER NEW SEVENSKINS, AND STOOD IN HER FIRST ONE (a).(a) This refers to the growth of the Earth, whereas in the Stanza treating of the First Round it is said (given in theCommentary):--\"After the changeless (avikara) immutable nature (Essence, sadaikarupa) had awakened and changed (differentiated)into (a state of) causality (avayakta), and from cause (Karana) had become its own discrete effect (vyakta), from invisibleit became visible.

The former Adam is the Sephirothal Host; the second Adam is the Mindless first human Root-race; the third Adam is the race that separated, whose eyes are opened.** For a discussion of the scientific objections to the views and figures here enunciated, the reader is referred to theAddenda, which form Part III. of this book.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 47 NARADA AND ASURAMAYA.atoms, or aniyamsam aniyasam) became one and the many (ekanekarupa); and producing the Universe produced alsothe Fourth Loka (our Earth) in the garland of the seven lotuses. The Achyuta then became the Chyuta.*The Earth is said to cast off her old three skins, because this refers to the three preceding Rounds she has alreadypassed through; the present being the fourth Round out of the seven. At the beginning of every new ROUND, after aperiod of \"obscuration,\" the earth (as do also the other six \"earths\") casts off, or is supposed to cast off, her old skins asthe Serpent does: therefore she is called in the Aitareya-Brahmana the Sarpa Rajni, \"the Queen of the Serpents,\" and\"the mother of all that moves.\" The \"Seven Skins,\" in the first of which she now stands, refer to the seven geologicalchanges which accompany and correspond to the evolution of the Seven Root-Races of Humanity.Stanza II., which speaks of this Round, begins with a few words of information concerning the age of our Earth. Thechronology will be given in its place. In the Commentary appended to the Stanza, two personages are mentioned: Naradaand Asura Maya, especially the latter. All the calculations are attributed to this archaic celebrity; and what follows willmake the reader superficially acquainted with some of these figures.--------TWO ANTEDILUVIAN ASTRONOMERS.To the mind of the Eastern student of Occultism, two figures are indissolubly connected with mystic astronomy,chronology, and their cycles. Two grand and mysterious figures, towering like two giants in the Archaic Past, emergebefore him, whenever he has to refer to Yugas and Kalpas. When, at what period of pre-history they lived, none save afew men in the world know, or ever can know with that certainty which is required by exact chronology. It may have been100,000 years ago, it may have been 1,000,000, for all that the outside world will ever know. The mystic West andFreemasonry talk loudly of Enoch and Hermes. The mystic East speaks of NARADA, the old Vedic Rishi, and ofASURAMAYA, the Atlantean.It has already been hinted that of all the incomprehensible characters in the Mahabharata and the Puranas, Narada, theson of Brahrna in Matsya Purana, the progeny of Kasyapa and the daughter of Daksha[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Achyuta is an almost untranslatable term. It means that which is not subject to fall or change for the worse: theUnfalling; and it is the reverse of chyuta, \"the Fallen.\" The Dhyanis who incarnate in the human forms of the Third Root-Race and endow them with intellect (Manas) are called the chyuta, for they fall into generation.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 48 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.in the Vishnu Purana, is the most mysterious. He is referred to by the honourable title of Deva Rishi (divine Rishi, morethan a demi-god) by Parasara, and yet he is cursed by Daksha and even by Brahma. He informs Kansa that Bhagavat (orVishnu in exotericism) would incarnate in the eighth child of Devaki, and thus brings the wrath of the Indian Herod uponKrishna's mother; and then, from the cloud on which he is seated -- invisible as a true Manasaputra -- he lauds Krishna, indelight at the Avatar's feat of killing the monster Kesim. Narada is here, there, and everywhere; and yet, none of thePuranas gives the true characteristics of this great enemy of physical procreation. Whatever those characteristics may bein Hindu Esotericism, Narada -- who is called in Cis-Himalayan Occultism Pesh-Hun, the \"Messenger,\" or the GreekAngelos -- is the sole confidant and the executor of the universal decrees of Karma and Adi-Budh: a kind of active andever incarnating logos, who leads and guides human affairs from the beginning to the end of the Kalpa.\"Pesh-Hun\" is a general not a special Hindu possession. He is the mysterious guiding intelligent power, which gives theimpulse to, and regulates the impetus of cycles, Kalpas and universal events.* He is Karma's visible adjuster on a generalscale; the inspirer and the leader of the greatest heroes of this Manvantara. In the exoteric works he is referred to bysome very uncomplimentary names; such as \"Kali-Karaka,\" strife-maker, \"Kapi-vaktra,\" monkey-faced, and even\"Pisuna,\" the spy, though elsewhere he is called Deva-Brahma. Even Sir W. Jones was strongly impressed with thismysterious character from what he gathered in his Sanskrit Studies. He compares him to Hermes and Mercury, and callshim \"the eloquent messenger of the gods\" (see Asiat. Res. I. p. 264). All this led the late Dr. Kenealy (\"Book of God\"), onthe ground that the Hindus believe him to be a great Rishi, \"who is for ever wandering about the earth, giving goodcounsel,\" to see in him one of his twelve Messiahs. He was, perhaps, not so far off the real track as some imagine.What Narada really is, cannot be explained in print; nor would the modern generations of the profane gather much fromthe information. But it may be remarked, that if there is in the Hindu Pantheon a deity which resembles Jehovah, in,tempting by \"suggestion\" of thoughts and \"hardening\" of the hearts of those whom he would make his tools and victims, itis Narada. Only with the latter it is no desire to obtain a pretext for \"plaguing,\" and thus showing that \"I am the Lord God.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"* This is perhaps the reason why, in the Bhagavad Gita, we are told that Brahma had communicated to Narada in thebeginning that all men whatsoever, even Mlechchhas, outcasts and barbarians, might know the true nature of Vasudevaand learn to have faith in that deity.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 49 THE MIRROR OF FUTURITY.Nor is it through any ambitious or selfish motive; but, verily, to serve and guide universal progress and evolution.Narada is one of the few prominent characters, save some gods, in the Puranas, who visits the so-called nether orinfernal regions, Patala. Whether or not it was from his intercourse with the thousand-headed Sesha, the serpent whobears the seven Patalas and the entire world like a diadem upon his heads, and who is the great teacher of astronomy,*that Narada learned all that he knew, certain it is that he surpasses Garga's Guru in his knowledge of cyclic intricacies. Itis he who has charge of our progress and national weal or woe. It is he who brings on wars and puts an end to them. Inthe old Stanzas Pesh-Hun is credited with having calculated and recorded all the astronomical and cosmic cycles tocome, and with having taught the Science to the first gazers at the starry vault. And it is Asuramaya, who is said to havebased all his astronomical works upon those records, to have determined the duration of all the past geological andcosmical periods, and the length of the all the cycles to come, till the end of this life-cycle, or the end of the seventh Race.There is a work among the Secret Books, called the \"Mirror of Futurity,\" wherein all the Kalpas within Kalpas and cycleswithin the bosom of Sesha, or infinite Time, are recorded. This work is ascribed to Pesh-Hun Narada. There is another oldwork which is attributed to various Atlanteans. It is these two Records which furnish us with the figures of our cycles, andthe possibility of calculating the date of cycles to come. The chronological calculations which will presently be given are,however, those of the Brahmins as explained further on; but most of them are also those of the Secret Doctrine.The chronology and computations of the Brahmin Initiates are based upon the Zodiacal records of India, and the works ofthe above-mentioned astronomer and magician -- Asuramaya. The Atlantean zodiacal records cannot err, as they werecompiled under the guidance of those who first taught astronomy, among other things, to mankind.But here again we are deliberately and recklessly facing a new difficulty. We shall be told that our statement iscontradicted by science, in the person of a man regarded as a great authority (in the West) upon all subjects of Sanskritliterature -- Professor Albrecht Weber, of Berlin. This, to our great regret, cannot be helped; and we are ready to maintainwhat is now stated. Asuramaya, to whom the epic tradition points as the earliest astronomer in Aryavarta, one to whom\"the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Sesha, who is also Ananta, the infinite, and the \"Cycle of Eternity\" in esotericism, is credited with having given hisastronomical knowledge to Garga, the oldest astronomer of India, who propitiated him, and forthwith knew all about theplanets and how to read omens.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 50 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Sun-god imparted the knowledge of the stars,\" in propria persona, as Dr. Weber himself states, is identified by him, insome very mysterious way, with the \"Ptolemaios\" of the Greeks. No more valid reason is given for this identification thanthat \"this latter name (Ptolemaios), as we see from the inscription of Piyadasi, became the Indian 'Turamaya,' out ofwhich the name 'Asuramaya' might very easily grow.\" No doubt it \"might,\" but the vital question is -- Are there any goodproofs that it has thus grown? The only evidence that is given for it is, that it must be so: \"since this Maya is distinctlyassigned to Romaka-pura in the West.\"* The Maya is evident, since no Sanskritist among Europeans can tell where thatlocality of \"Romaka-pura\" was, except, indeed, that it was somewhere \"in the West.\" Anyhow, as no member of theAsiatic Society, or Western Orientalist, will ever listen to a Brahmanical teaching, it is useless to take the objections ofEuropean Orientalists into consideration. \"Romakapura\" was in \"the West,\" certainly, since it was part and parcel of thelast continent of ATLANTIS. And it is equally certain that it is Atlantis, which is assigned in the Hindu Puranas as the birth-place of Asuramaya, \"as great a magician as he was an Astrologer and an Astronomer.\" Moreover, Prof. Weber refusesto assign any great antiquity to the Indian Zodiac, and feels inclined to think that the Hindus never knew of a Zodiac at alltill \"they had borrowed one from the Greeks.\"** This statement clashes with the most ancient traditions of India, and musttherefore be ignored. (Vide \"The Zodiac and its Antiquity\"). We are the more justified in ignoring it, as the learned GermanProfessor himself tells us in the introduction to his work (History of Sanskrit Literature) that \"in addition to the naturalobstacles which impede investigation (in India), there still prevails a dense mist of prejudices and preconceived opinionshovering over the land, and enfolding it as with a veil.\" Caught in that veil, it is no wonder that Dr. Weber should himselfhave been led into involuntary errors. Let us hope that he knows better now.Now whether Asuramaya is to be considered a modern myth, a personage who flourished in the day of the MacedonianGreeks, or as that which he is claimed to be by the Occultists, in any case his calculations agree entirely with those of theSecret Records.From fragments of immensely old works attributed to the Atlantean astronomer, and found in Southern India, the calendarelsewhere men-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Lectures on the Indian Literature,\" p. 253, by Prof. A.

If wecompare its statements with those made several years earlier in \"Isis Unveiled,\" with the fragmentary teachings publishedby some Theosophists, and with the present data derived from the Secret Books of Occultism, the whole will be found toagree perfectly, save in some details which may not be explained; for secrets of higher Initiation -- as unknown to thewriter as they are to the reader -- would have to be revealed, and that cannot be done.

In the \"Physician's Hymn,\" (X 97 1) it issaid that \"the plants came into being three ages (Triyugam) before the gods\" on our Earth (See \"Chronology of theBrahmins\" at the end of this Stanza).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 53 THE MONSTERS OF CHAOS.It is not even allegory. Here we have facts, that are found repeated in the account of Pymander, as well as in theChaldean tablets of creation. The verses may almost be checked by the Cosmogony, as given by Berosus, which hasbeen disfigured out of recognition by Eusebius, but some of the features of which may yet be found in fragments left byancient Greek authors -- Apollodorus, Alexander Polyhistor, etc., etc. \"The water-men terrible and bad,\" who were theproduction of physical nature alone, a result of the \"evolutionary impulse\" and the first attempt to create man the \"crown,\"and the aim and goal of all animal life on Earth -- are shown to be failures in our Stanzas. Do we not find the same in theBerosian Cosmogony, denounced with such vehemence as the culmination of heathen absurdity? And yet who of theEvolutionists can say that things in the beginning have not come to pass as they are described? That, as maintained inthe Puranas, the Egyptian and Chaldean fragments, and even in Genesis, there have not been two, and even more,\"creations\" before the last formation of the Globe; which, changing its geological and atmospheric conditions, changedalso its flora, its fauna, and its men? This claim agrees not only with every ancient Cosmogony, but also with modernscience, and even, to a certain degree, with the theory of evolution, as may be demonstrated in a few words.There is no \"dark creation,\" no \"Evil Dragon\" conquered by a Sun-God, in the earliest World-Cosmogonies. Even with theAkkads, the great Deep (the Watery Abyss, or SPACE) was the birthplace and abode of Ea, Wisdom, the incognizableinfinite Deity. But with the Semites and the later Chaldeans, the fathomless Deep of Wisdom becomes gross matter, sinfulSubstance, and Ea is changed into Tiamat, the dragon slain by Merodach, or Satan, in the astral waves.In the Hindu Puranas, Brahma, the creator, is seen recommencing de novo several creations after as many failures; andtwo great creations are mentioned,* the Padma and the Varaha, the present, when the Earth was lifted out of the water byBrahma, in the shape of a boar, or \"Varaha Avatar.\" Creation is shown as a sport, an amusement (Lila) of the creativegod. The Zohar speaks of primordial worlds, which perished as soon as they came into existence. And the same is said inMidraish, Rabbi Abahu explaining distinctly (in Bereschith Rabba, Parscha IX.) that \"the Holy One\" had successivelycreated and de-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"* These two must not be confused with the seven creations or divisions in each Kalpa (See Book I. \"The SevenCreations\").

This does not relate only to other worlds in space, but toa mystery of our own globe contained in the allegory about the \"kings of Edom.\" For the words, \"This one pleases me,\"are repeated in Genesis i. 31, though in disfigured terms, as usual. The Chaldean fragments of Cosmogony on theCuneiform inscriptions, and elsewhere, show two distinct creations of animals and men, the first being destroyed, as itwas a failure. The Cosmogonical tablets prove that this our actual creation was preceded by others (See \"HibbertLectures,\" p. 390); and as shown by the author of \"The Qabbalah,\" in the Zohar, Siphrah Dzeniouta, in Jovah Rabbah,128a, etc., etc. The Kabala states the same.(b) Oannes (or Dagon, the Chaldean \"Man-fish\") divides his Cosmogony and Genesis into two portions. First the abyss ofwaters and darkness, wherein resided most hideous beings -- men with wings, four and two-faced men, human beingswith two heads, with the legs and horns of a goat (our \"goat-men,\")* hippocentaurs, bulls with the heads of men, and dogswith tails of fishes. In short, combinations of various animals and men, of fishes, reptiles and other monstrous animalsassuming each other's shapes and countenances. The feminine element they resided in, is personified by Thalatth -- theSea, or \"Water\" -- which was finally conquered by Belus, the male principle. And Polyhistor says: \"Belus came and cut thewoman asunder, and of one half of her he formed the Earth, and of the other half the heavens, and at the same time hedestroyed the animals within her.\" As pertinently remarked by I. Myer, \"with the Akkadians each object and power ofNature had its Zi, Spirit. The Akkadians formed their deities into triads, usually males (sexless, rather?); the Semites alsohad triadic deities, but introduced sex\" (p. 246) -- or phallicism. With the Aryans and the earliest Akkadians all things areemanations through, not by, a creator or logos. With the Semites everything is begotten.-------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Whence the identity of the ideas? The Chinese have the same traditions. According to the commentator Kwoh P'oh, inthe work called Shan-Hai-King, \"Wonders by Sea and Land,\" a work which was written by the historiographer Chung Kufrom engravings on nine urns made by the Emperor Yu, (B.C. 2255), an interview is mentioned with men having twodistinct faces on their heads, before and behind, monsters with bodies of goats and human faces, etc. Gould, in his\"Mythical Monsters,\" p. 27, giving the names of some authors on Natural History, mentions Shan-Hai-King. According toKwoh P'oh (A.D. 276-324) this work was compiled three thousand years before his time, or at seven dynasties distance.Yang Sun of the Ming Dynasty (commencing A.D. 1368) states that it was compiled by Kung Chia and Chung Ku (asstated above). Chung Ku at the time of the last emperor of the Hia dynasty, B.C. 1818, fearing that the emperor mightdestroy the books treating of the ancient time, carried them in his flight to Yin.

THE DHYANI FROM THE BRIGHT FATHER-MOTHER, FROM THE WHITE(Solar-lunar) REGIONS THEY CAME,* FROM THE ABODES OF THE IMMORTAL-MORTALS (a).(a) The explanations given in our Stanzas are far more clear than that which the legend of creation from the Cutha tabletwould give, even were it complete. What is preserved on it, however, corroborates them. For, in the tablet, \"the Lord ofAngels\" destroys the men in the abyss, when \"there were not left the carcases and waste\" after they were slaughtered.After which they, the Great Gods, create men with the bodies of birds of the desert, human beings, \"seven kings, brothersof the same family,\" etc., which is a reference to the locomotive qualities of the primary ethereal bodies of men, whichcould fly as well as they could walk,** but who \"were destroyed\" because they were not \"perfect,\" i.e., they \"were sexless,like the Kings of Edom.\"Weeded of metaphors and allegories, what will science say to this idea of a primordial creation of species? It will object tothe \"Angels\" and \"Spirits\" having anything to do therewith: but if it is nature and the physical law of evolution that are thecreators of all there is now on Earth, why could there be \"no such abyss\" when the globe was covered with waters, inwhich numbers of monstrous beings were generated? Is it the \"human beings\" and animals with human heads anddouble faces, which are a point of the objection? But if man is only a higher animal and has evolved from the brutespecies by an infinite series of transformations, why could not the \"missing links\" have had human heads attached to thebodies of animals, or, being two-headed, have heads of beasts and vice versa, in Nature's early efforts? Are we notshown during the geological periods, in the ages of the reptiles and the mammalia, lizards with birds' wings, and serpents'heads on animal bodies.*** And, arguing from the standpoint of science, does not even our modern human raceoccasionally furnish us with monster-specimens: two-headed children, animal bodies with human heads, dog-headedbabies, etc., etc.?

But we shall not wait for the approval of eitherdogmatic theology or materialistic science, but proceed with the Stanzas. Let these speak for themselves, with the help ofthe light thrown by the Commentaries and their explanations; the scientific aspect of these questions will be consideredlater on.Thus physical nature, when left to herself in the creation of animal and man, is shown to have failed. She can produce thefirst two and the lower animal kingdoms, but when it comes to the turn of man, spiritual, independent and intelligentpowers are required for his creation, besides the \"coats of skin\" and the \"Breath of animal Life.\" The human Monads ofpreceding Rounds need something higher than purely physical materials to build their personalities with, under thepenalty of remaining even below any \"Frankenstein\" animal.*-------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the first volume of the lately published \"Introduction a l'atude des Races Humaines,\" by M. de Quatrefages, there isproof that since the post-tertiary period and even before that time -- since many Races were already scattered during thatage on the face of the Earth -- man has not altered one iota in his physical structure. And if, surrounded for ages by afauna that altered from one period or cycle to another, which died out, which was reborn in other forms -- so that nowthere does not exist one single animal on Earth, large or small, contemporary with the man of that period -- if, then, everyanimal has been transformed save man himself, this fact goes to prove not only his antiquity, but that he is a distinctKingdom. Why should he alone have escaped transformation? Because, says de Quatrefages, the weapon used by him,in his struggle with nature and the ever-changing geological conditions and elements, was \"his psychic force, not hisphysical strength or body,\" as in the case of animals. Give man only that dose of intelligence and reason with which othermammalia are endowed, and with his present bodily organization he will show himself the most helpless of creatures ofEarth. And as everything goes to prove that the human organism with all its characteristics, peculiarities andidiosyncrasies existed already on our Globe in those far distant geological periods when there was not yet one singlespecimen of the now-existing forms of mammalia, what is the unavoidable conclusion? Why this: Since all the humanraces are of one and the same species, it follows that this species is the most ancient of all the now-living mammalia.Therefore it is the most stable and persevering of all, and was already as fully developed as it is now when all the othermammalia now known had not made even their first approach to appearance on this Earth. Such is the opinion of thegreat French Naturalist, who gives thereby a terrible blow to Darwinism.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 57 THE \"DOUBLE DRAGON.\"7.

Possessed of the desire and ofthe power to create, and, impelled by the potencies of what is to be created, again and again does he, at the outset of aKalpa, put forth a similar creation,\" (see Vishnu Purana, Book I. ch. V., closing Sloka. Also \"Manava Dharma Shastra\" I.30.) It is now proposed to examine the exoteric account in the Vishnu Purana, and see how much it may agree ordisagree with our occult version.-------CREATION OF DIVINE BEINGS IN THE EXOTERIC ACCOUNTS.In the Vishnu Purana -- which is certainly the earliest of all the scriptures of that name -- we find, as in all the others,Brahma assuming as the male God, for purposes of creation, \"four bodies invested by three qualities.\"* It is said: \"In thismanner, Maitreya, Jyotsna (dawn), Ratri (night), Ahan (day), and Sandhya (evening twilight) are the four bodies ofBrahma\" . . (p. 81, Vol. I., Wilson's translation). As Parasara explains it, when Brahma wants to create the world anewand construct progeny through his will, in the fourfold condition (or the four orders of beings) termed gods (DhyanChohans), Demons** (i.e., more material Devas), Progenitors (Pitris) and men, \"he collects Yoga-like (Yuyuje) his mind.\"Strange to say, he begins by creating DEMONS, who thus take precedence over the angels or gods. This is noincongruity, nor is it due to inconsistency, but has, like all the rest, a profound esoteric meaning, quite clear to one freefrom Christian theological prejudice. He who bears in mind that the principle MAHAT, or Intellect, the \"Universal Mind\"(literally \"the great\"), which esoteric philosophy explains as the \"manifested Omniscience\" -- the \"first product\" ofPradhana (primordial matter) as Vishnu Purana says, but the first Cosmic aspect of Parabrahm or the esoteric SAT, theUniversal Soul,*** as Occultism[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This has in esotericism a direct bearing upon the seven principles of the manifested Brahma, or universe, in the sameorder as in man. Exoterically, it is only four principles.** Demons is a very loose word to use, as it applies to a great number of inferior -- i.e., more material -- Spirits, or minorGods, who are so termed because they \"war\" with the higher ones; but they are no devils.*** The same order of principles in man:-- Atma (Spirit), Buddhi (Soul), its vehicle, as Matter is the Vahan of Spirit, andManas (mind), the third, or the fifth microcosmically. On the plane of personality, Manas is the first.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 59 THE BODIES OF BRAHMA.teaches -- is at the root of SELF-Consciousness, will understand the reason why. The so-called \"Demons\" -- who are(esoterically) the Self-asserting and (intellectually) active Principle -- are the positive poles of creation, so to say; hence,the first produced. This is in brief the process as narrated allegorically in the Puranas.\"Having concentrated his mind into itself and the quality of darkness pervading Brahma's assumed body, the Asuras,issuing from his thigh, were first produced; after which, abandoning this body, it was transformed into NIGHT.\" (See PartII., § \"The Fallen Angels.\")Two important points are involved herein:-- (a) Primarily in the Rig-Veda, the \"Asuras\" are shown as spiritual divinebeings; their etymology is derived from asu (breath), the \"Breath of God,\" and they mean the same as the Supreme Spiritor the Zoroastrian Ahura. It is later on, for purposes of theology and dogma, that they are shown issuing from Brahma'sthigh, and that their name began to be derived from a privative, and sura, god (solar deities), or not-a-god, and that theybecame the enemies of the gods. Every ancient theogony without exception -- from the Aryan and the Egyptian down tothat of Hesiod -- places, in the order of Cosmogonical evolution, Night before the Day; even Genesis, where \"darkness isupon the face of the deep\" before \"the first day.\" The reason for this is that every Cosmogony -- except in the SecretDoctrine -- begins by the \"Secondary Creation\" so-called: to wit, the manifested Universe, the Genesis of which has toopen by a marked differentiation between the eternal Light of Primary Creation, whose mystery must remain for ever\"Darkness\" to the prying finite conception and intellect of the profane, and the Secondary Evolution of manifested visiblenature. The Veda contains the whole philosophy of that division without having ever been correctly explained by ourOrientalists, because it has never been understood by them."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Continuing to create, Brahma assumes another form, that of the Day, and creates from his breath the gods, who areendowed with the quality of goodness (passivity)*. In his next body the quality of great passivity prevailed, which is also(negative) goodness, and from the side of that personage issued the Pitris, the progenitors of men, because, as the textexplains, \"Brahma thought of himself (during the process) as the father of the world.\"** This is Kriya-sakti -- themysterious Yoga power[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Thus, says the Commentary, the saying \"by day the gods are most powerful, and by night the demons,\" is purelyallegorical.** This thinking of oneself as this, that, or the other, is the chief factor in the production of every kind of psychic or evenphysical phenomena. The words \"whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea, and shallnot doubt . . . . that thing will come to pass,\" are no vain words. Only the word \"faith\" ought to be translated by WILL.

This body of Brahma when cast off became the Sandhya (evening twilight), the interval betweenday and night.Finally Brahma assumed his last form pervaded by the quality of foulness, \"and from this MEN, in whom foulness andpassion predominate, were produced.\" This body when cast off became the dawn, or morning twilight -- the twilight ofHumanity. Here Brahma stands esoterically for the Pitris. He is collectively the Pitar, \"father.\"The true esoteric meaning of this allegory must now be explained. Brahma here symbolizes personally the collectivecreators of the World and Men -- the universe with all its numberless productions of things movable and (seemingly)immovable.* He is collectively the Prajapatis, the Lords of Being; and the four bodies typify the four classes of creativepowers or Dhyan Chohans, described in the Commentary directly following Stanza VII. in Book I. The whole philosophy ofthe so-called \"Creation\" of the good and evil in this world and of the whole cycle of Manvantaric results therefrom, hangson the correct comprehension of these Four bodies of Brahma.The reader will now be prepared to understand the real, the esoteric significance of what follows. Moreover there is animportant point to be cleared up. Christian theology having arbitrarily settled and agreed that Satan with his Fallen Angelsbelonged to the earliest creation, Satan being the first-created, the wisest and most beautiful of God's Archangels, theword was given, the key-note struck. Henceforth all the pagan scriptures were made to yield the same meaning, and allwere shown to be demoniacal, and it was and is claimed that truth and fact belong to, and commence only with,Christianity. Even the Orientalists and Mythologists, some of them no Christians at all but \"infidels,\" or men of science,entered unconsciously to themselves, and by the mere force of association of ideas and habit, into the theological groove.Purely Brahmanical considerations, based on greed of power and ambition, allowed the masses to remain in ignorance ofgreat truths; and the same causes led the Initiates among the early Christians to remain silent, while those who had neverknown the truth disfigured the order of things, judging of the hierarchy of \"Angels\" by their exoteric form. Thus as theAsuras had become the rebellious inferior gods fighting the higher ones in popular creeds, so the highest archangel, intruth the Agathodaemon, the eldest benevolent Logos, became with theology the \"Adversary\" or Satan. But is thiswarranted by the correct interpretation of any old Scripture? The answer is, most certainly not. As the Mazdean Scripturesof the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The same idea is found in the first four chapters of Genesis, with their \"Lord\" and \"God,\" which are the Elohim and theAndrogynous Eloha.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 61 WHAT THE GNOSTICS SAY.Zend-Avesta, the Vendidad and others correct and expose the later cunning shuffling of the gods in the Hindu Pantheon,and restore through AHURA the Asuras to their legitimate place in theogony, so the recent discoveries of the Chaldeantablets vindicate the good name of the first divine Emanations. This is easily proved. Christian Angelology is directly andsolely derived from that of the Pharisees, who brought their tenets from Babylonia. The Sadducees, the real guardians ofthe Laws of Moses, knew not of, and rejected, any angels, opposing even the immortality of the human Soul (notimpersonal Spirit). In the Bible the only \"Angels\" spoken of are the \"Sons of God\" mentioned in Genesis vi. (who are nowregarded as the Nephilim, the Fallen Angels), and several angels in human form, the \"Messengers\" of the Jewish God,whose own rank needs a closer analysis than heretofore given. (Vide Supra, Stanza I., sub-sections 2, 3, et seq., where itis shown that the early Akkadians called Ea, Wisdom, that which was disfigured by the later Chaldees and Semites intoTismat, Tisalat and the Thallath of Berosus, the female Sea Dragon, now Satan.) Truly -- \"How art thou fallen (by thehand of man), O bright star and son of the morning\"!Now what do the Babylonian accounts of \"Creation,\" as found on the Assyrian fragments of tiles, tell us; those veryaccounts upon which the Pharisees built their angelology? But compare Mr. G. Smith's \"Assyrian Discoveries,\" p. 398,and his \"Chaldean Account of Genesis,\" p. 107. The \"Tablet with the story of the Seven Wicked Gods or Spirits,\" has thefollowing account -- we print the important passages in italics:--1. In the first days the evil Gods,2. the angels, who were in rebellion, who in the lower part of heaven3. had been created,4. they caused their evil work"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"5. devising with wicked heads . . . . etc.Thus we are shown, as plainly as can be, on a fragment which remained unbroken, so that there can be no dubiousreading, that the \"rebellious angels\" had been created in the lower part of heaven, i.e., that they belonged and do belongto a material plane of evolution, although as it is not the plane of which we are made cognizant through our senses, itremains generally invisible to us, and is thus regarded as subjective. Were the Gnostics so wrong, after this, in affirmingthat this our visible world, and especially the Earth, had been created by lower angels, the inferior Elohim, of which, asthey taught, the God of Israel was one. These Gnostics were nearer in time to the records of the Archaic Secret Doctrine,and therefore ought to be allowed to have known better than non-initiated Christians, who took upon themselves,hundreds of years------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 62 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.later, to remodel and correct what was said. But let us see what the same Tablet says further on:--7. There were seven of them (the wicked gods) . . . . (then follows the description of these, the fourth being a \"serpent,\"the phallic symbol of the fourth Race in human Evolution).15. The seven of them, messengers of the God Anu, their king.Now Anu belongs to the Chaldean trinity, and is identical with Sin, the \"Moon,\" in one aspect. And the Moon in theHebrew Kabala is the Argha of the seed of all material life, and is still more closely connected, kabalistically, withJehovah, who is double-sexed as Anu is. They are both represented in Esotericism and viewed from a dual aspect: maleor spiritual, female or material, or Spirit and Matter, the two antagonistic principles. Hence the \"Messengers of Anu,\" (whois Sin, the \"Moon,\") are shown, in verses 28 to 41, as being finally overpowered by the same Sin with the help of Bel (theSun) and Ishtar (Venus). This is regarded as a contradiction by the Assyriologists, but is simply metaphysics in theesoteric teaching.There is more than one interpretation, for there are seven keys to the mystery of the Fall. Moreover there are two \"Falls\"in Theology: the rebellion of the Archangels and their \"Fall,\" and the \"Fall\" of Adam and Eve. Thus the lower as well asthe higher Hierarchies are charged with a supposed crime. The word \"supposed\" is the true and correct term, for in bothcases it is founded on misconception. Both are considered in Occultism as Karmic effects, and both belong to the law ofEvolution: intellectual and spiritual on the one hand, physical and psychic on the other. The \"Fall\" is a universal allegory. Itsets forth at one end of the ladder of Evolution the \"rebellion,\" i.e., the action of differentiating intellection orconsciousness on its various planes, seeking union with matter; and at the other, the lower end, the rebellion of matteragainst Spirit, or of action against spiritual inertia. And here lies the germ of an error which has had such disastrouseffects on the intelligence of civilized societies for over 1,800 years. In the original allegory it is matter -- hence the morematerial angels -- which was regarded as the conqueror of Spirit, or the Archangels who \"fell\" on this plane. \"They of theflaming sword (or animal passions) had put to flight the Spirits of Darkness.\" Yet it is the latter who fought for thesupremacy of the conscious and divine spirituality on Earth and failed, succumbing to the power of matter. But intheological dogma we see the reverse. It is Michael, \"who is like unto God,\" the representative of Jehovah, who is theleader of the celestial hosts -- as Lucifer, in Milton's fancy, is of the infernal hosts -- who has the best of Satan. It is truethat the nature of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 63 WHO ARE THE \"FLAMES\"?Michael depends upon that of his Creator and Master. Who the latter is, one may find out by carefully studying theallegory of the \"War in Heaven\" with the astronomical key. As shown by Bentley, the \"War of the Titans against the gods\"in Hesiod, and also the war of the Asuras (or the Tarakamaya) against the devas in Puranic legend, are identical in allsave the names. The aspects of the stars show (Bentley taking the year 945 B.C. as the nearest date for suchconjunction) that \"all the planets, except Saturn, were on the same side of the heavens as the Sun and Moon,\" and hencewere his opponents. And yet it is Saturn, or the Jewish \"Moon-god,\" who is shown as prevailing, both by Hesiod andMoses, neither of whom was understood. Thus it was that the real meaning became distorted.-------STANZA II. -- Continued.8. THE FLAMES CAME. THE FIRES WITH THE SPARKS; THE NIGHT FIRES AND THE DAY FIRES (a). THEY DRIEDOUT THE TURBID DARK WATERS. WITH THEIR HEAT THEY QUENCHED THEM. THE LHAS (Spirits) OF THE HIGH;THE LHAMAYIN (those) OF BELOW, CAME (b). THEY SLEW THE FORMS, WHICH WERE TWO- AND FOUR-FACED.THEY FOUGHT THE GOAT-MEN, AND THE DOG-HEADED MEN, AND THE MEN WITH FISHES' BODIES.(a) The \"Flames\" are a Hierarchy of Spirits parallel to, if not identical with, the \"burning\" fiery Saraph (Seraphim)mentioned by Isaiah (vi. 2-6), those who attend, according to Hebrew Theogony, \"the Throne of the Almighty.\" Melha isthe Lord of the \"Flames.\" When he appears on Earth, he assumes the personality of a Buddha, says a popular legend. Heis one of the most ancient and revered Lhas, a Buddhist St. Michael.(b) The word \"Below\" must not be taken to mean infernal regions, but simply a spiritual, or rather ethereal, Being of alower grade, because nearer to the Earth, or one step higher than our terrestrial sphere; while the Lhas are Spirits of thehighest Spheres -- whence the name of the capital of Tibet, Lha-ssa.Besides a statement of a purely physical nature and belonging to the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 64 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"evolution of life on Earth, there may be another allegorical meaning attached to this Sloka, or indeed, as is taught,several. The FLAMES, or \"Fires,\" represent Spirit, or the male element, and \"Water,\" matter, or the opposite element. Andhere again we find, in the action of the Spirit slaying the purely material form, a reference to the eternal struggle, on thephysical and psychic planes, between Spirit and Matter, besides a scientific cosmic fact. For, as said in the next verse:---------9. MOTHER-WATER, THE GREAT SEA WEPT. SHE AROSE, SHE DISAPPEARED IN THE MOON, WHICH HADLIFTED HER, WHICH HAD GIVEN HER BIRTH (a).(a) Now what can this mean? Is it not an evident reference to tidal action in the early stage of the history of our planet inits fourth Round? Modern research has been busy of late in its speculations on the Palaeozoic high-tides. Mr. Darwin'stheory was that not less than 52,000,000 years ago -- and probably much more -- the Moon originated from the Earth'splastic mass. Starting from the point where research was left by Helmholtz, Ferrel, Sir William Thomson and others, heretraced the course of tidal retardation of the earth's rotary motions far back into the very night of time, and placed theMoon during the infancy of our planet at only \"a fraction of its present distance.\" In short, his theory was that it is theMoon which separated from the Earth. The tidal elevation concurring with the swing of the globular mass -- centrifugaltendency being then nearly equal to gravity -- the latter was overcome, and the tidally elevated mass could thus separatecompletely from the Earth.*The Occult teaching is the reverse of this. The Moon is far older than the Earth; and, as explained in Book I., it is the latterwhich owes its being to the former, however astronomy and geology may explain the fact. Hence, the tides and theattraction to the Moon, as shown by the liquid portion of the Globe ever striving to raise itself towards its parent. This isthe meaning of the sentence that \"the Mother-Water arose and disappeared in the Moon, which had lifted her, which hadgiven her birth.\"-------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* But see the difficulties suggested later, in the works of various geologists, against this theory. Compare Sir R. S. Bull'sarticle in \"Nature\" (Dec. 1, 1881), and also what the American geologists say.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 65 DIVINE WILL BECOMES EROS.10. WHEN THEY (the Rupas) WERE DESTROYED, MOTHER-EARTH REMAINED BARE,* SHE ASKED TO BE DRIED(a).**(a) The time for its incrustation had arrived. The waters had separated and the process was started. It was the beginningof a new life. This is what one key divulges to us. Another key teaches the origin of Water, its admixture with Fire (liquidfire it calls it),*** and enters upon an alchemical description of the progeny of the two -- solid matter such as minerals andearths. From the \"Waters of Space,\" the progeny of the male Spirit-Fire and the female (gaseous) Water has become theOceanic expanse on Earth. Varuna is dragged down from the infinite Space, to reign as Neptune over the finite Seas. Asalways, the popular fancy is found to be based on a strictly scientific foundation.Water is the symbol of the female element everywhere; mater, from which the letter M, is derived pictorially from[[diagram]] a water hieroglyph. It is the universal matrix or the \"Great Deep.\" Venus, the great Mother-Virgin, issues forthfrom the Sea-wave, and Cupid or Eros is her son. But Venus is the later mythological variant of Gaia (or Gaea), the Earth,which, in its higher aspect is Nature (Prakriti), and metaphysically Aditi, and even Mulaprakriti, the root of Prakriti or itsnoumenon.Hence Cupid or Love in his primitive sense is Eros, the Divine Will, or Desire of manifesting itself through visible creation.Thence Fohat, the prototype of Eros, becomes on Earth the great power \"Life-electricity,\" or the Spirit of \"Life-giving.\" Letus remember the Greek Theogony and enter into the spirit of its philosophy. We are taught by the Greeks (See \"Iliad\" IV.,201, 246) that all things, gods included, owe their being to the Ocean and his wife Tethys, the latter being Gaea, theEarth or Nature. But who is Ocean? Ocean is the immeasurable SPACE (Spirit in Chaos), which is the Deity (see BookI.); and Tethys is not the Earth, but primordial matter in the process of formation. In our case it is no longer Aditi-Gaeawho begets Ouranos or Varuna, the chief Aditya among the seven planetary gods, but Prakriti, materialised and localised.The Moon, masculine in its theogonic character, is,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The goddess who gave birth to these primordial monsters, in the account of Berosus, was Thallath, in Greek Thalassa,\"the Sea.\"** See, for comparison, the account of creation by Berosus (Alexander Polyhistor) and the hideous beings born from thetwo-fold principle (Earth and Water) in the Abyss of primordial creation: Neras (Centaurs, men with the limbs of horsesand human bodies), and Kimnaras (men with the heads of horses) created by Brahma in the commencement of theKalpa.*** See Commentary following Sloka 18.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 66 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"in its cosmic aspect only, the female generative principle, as the Sun is the male emblem thereof. Water is the progeny ofthe Moon, an androgyne deity with every nation.Evolution proceeds on the laws of analogy in Kosmos as in the formation of the smallest globe. Thus the above, applyingto the modus operandi at the time when the Universe was appearing, applies also in the case of our Earth's formation.This Stanza opens by speaking of thirty crores, 30,000,000, of years. We may be asked -- What could the ancients knowof the duration of geological periods, when no modern scientist or mathematician is able to calculate their duration withanything like approximate accuracy? Whether they had or had not better means (and it is maintained that they had themin their Zodiacs), still the chronology of the ancient Brahmins shall now be given as faithfully as possible.-------THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE BRAHMINS.No greater riddle exists in science, no problem is more hopelessly insoluble, than the question: How old -- evenapproximately -- are the Sun and Moon, the Earth and Man? What does modern science know of the duration of the agesof the World, or even of the length of geological periods?Nothing; absolutely nothing.If one turns to science for chronological information, one is told by those who are straightforward and truthful, as forinstance Mr. Pengelly, the eminent geologist, \"We do not know.\"* One will learn that, so far, no trustworthy numericalestimate of the ages of the world and man could be made, and that both geology and anthropology are at sea. Yet whena student of esoteric philosophy presumes to bring forward the teachings of Occult Science, he is at once sat upon. Whyshould this be so, since, when reduced to their own physical methods, the greatest scientists have failed to arrive even atan approximate agreement?It is true that science can hardly be blamed for it. Indeed, in the Cimmerian darkness of the prehistoric ages, the explorersare lost in a labyrinth, whose great corridors are doorless, allowing no visible exit into the Archaic past. Lost in the mazeof their own conflicting speculations, rejecting, as they have always done, the evidence of Eastern tradition, without anyclue, or one single certain milestone to guide them, what can geologists or anthropologists do but pick up the slender[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For a similar admission see Prof. Lefevre's Philosophy, p. 481.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 67 THE RACE THAT NEVER DIES.thread of Ariadne where they first perceive it, and then proceed at perfect random? Therefore we are first told that thefarthest date to which documentary record extends is now generally regarded by Anthropology as but \"the earliestdistinctly visible point of the pre-historic period.\" (Encyclopaedia Britannica.)At the same time it is confessed that \"beyond that period stretches back a vast indefinite series of prehistoric ages.\" (Ibid.)It is with those specified \"Ages\" that we shall begin. They are \"prehistoric\" to the naked eye of matter only. To the spiritualeagle eye of the seer and the prophet of every race, Ariadne's thread stretches beyond that \"historic period\" without breakor flaw, surely and steadily, into the very night of time; and the hand which holds it is too mighty to drop it, or even let itbreak. Records exist, although they may be rejected as fanciful by the profane; though many of them are tacitly acceptedby philosophers and men of great learning, and meet with an unvarying refusal only from the official and collective bodyof orthodox science. And since the latter refuses to give us even an approximate idea of the duration of the geologicalages -- save in a few conflicting and contradictory hypotheses -- let us see what Aryan philosophy can teach us.Such computations as are given in Manu and the Puranas -- save trifling and most evidently intentional exaggerations --are, as already stated, almost identical with those taught in esoteric philosophy. This may be seen by comparing the twoin any Hindu calendar of recognised orthodoxy.The best and most complete of all such calendars, at present, as vouched for by the learned Brahmins of Southern India,is the already mentioned Tamil calendar called the \"Tirukkanda Panchanga,\" compiled, as we are told, from, and in fullaccordance with, secret fragments of Asuramaya's data. As Asuramaya is said to have been the greatest astronomer, sohe is whispered to have also been the most powerful \"Sorcerer\" of the \"WHITE ISLAND, which had become BLACK withsin,\" i.e., of the islands of Atlantis.The \"White Island\" is a symbolical name. Asuramaya is said to have lived (see the tradition of Jhana-bhaskara) inRomaka-pura in the West: because the name is an allusion to the land and cradle of the \"Sweat-born\" of the Third Race.That land or continent had disappeared ages before Asuramaya lived, since he was an Atlantean; but he was a directdescendant of the Wise Race, the Race that never dies. Many are the legends concerning this hero, the pupil of Surya(the Sun-God) himself, as the Indian accounts allege. It matters little whether he lived on one or another island, but thequestion is to prove that he was no myth, as Dr. Weber and others would make him. The------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 68 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.fact of \"Romaka-pura in the West\" being named as the birth-place of this hero of the archaic ages, is the more interestingbecause it is so very suggestive of the esoteric teaching about the \"Sweat-born\" Races, the men born from the pores oftheir parents. \"ROMAKUPAS\" means \"hair-pores\" in Sanskrit. In Mahabharata XII. 10,308, a people named Raumyas aresaid to have been created from the pores of Virabhadara, the terrible giant, who destroyed Daksha's sacrifice. Other"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"tribes and people are also represented as born in this way.

Occultism says: \"The astral prototypes of the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdomsup to man have taken that time (300 million years) to evolve, re-forming out of the cast-off materials of the precedingRound, which, though very dense and physical in their own cycle, are relatively ethereal as compared with the materialityof our present middle Round. At the expiration of these 300 million years, Nature, on the way to the physical and material,down the arc of descent, begins with mankind and works downwards, hardening or materialising forms as it proceeds.Thus the fossils found in strata, to which an antiquity, not of eighteen, but of many hundreds of millions of years, must beascribed, belong in reality to forms of the preceding Round, which, while living, were far more ethereal than physical, aswe know the physical. That we perceive and disinter them as tangible forms, is due to the process of materialization orcrystallization referred to, which took place subsequently, at the beginning of the Fourth Round, and reached itsmaximum after the appearance of man, proceeding parallel with his physical evolution. This alone illustrates the fact thatthe degree of materiality of the Earth changes pari passu with that of its inhabitants. And thus man now finds, as tangiblefossils, what were once the (to his present senses) ethereal forms of the lower kingdoms. The above Brahmanical figuresrefer to evolution beginning on Globe A, and in the First Round. In this Volume we speak only of this, the Fourth Round.\"*** This difference and the change of cyphers in the last three triplets of figures, the writer cannot undertake to accountfor.

The Logos is said to be born only metaphorically, as the Sun is born daily, or rather abeam of that Sun is born in the morning and is said to die when it disappears, whereas it is simply reabsorbed into theparent essence. Cosmic Pralaya is for things visible, not for the Arupa, formless, world. The Cosmic or Universal Pralayacomes only at the end of one hundred years of Brahma; when the Universal dissolution is said to take place. Then theAvyaya, say the exoteric scriptures, the eternal life symbolized by Vishnu, assuming the character of Rudra, theDestroyer, enters into the Seven Rays of the Sun and drinks up all the waters of the Universe. \"Thus fed, the seven solarRays dilate to seven Suns and set fire to the whole Cosmos. . . . .\"** Since a Maha-Yuga is the 1,000th part of a day of Brahma.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 70 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Add Sandhis, i.e., intervals between the reign of each Manu, which amountto six Maha-Yugas, equal to ............................................................ 25,920,000The total of these reigns and interregnums of 14 Manus, is 1,000 Maha-Yugas,which constitute a Kalpa, i.e., one day of Brahma ......................................................... 4,320,000,000As Brahma's Night is of equal duration, one Day and Night of Brahma would contain .................................................8,640,000,000360 of such days and nights make one year of Brahma make ..................................................... 3,110,400,000,000100 such years constitute the whole period of Brahma's age, i.e., Maha-Kalpa ...................................................311,040,000,000,000These are the exoteric figures accepted throughout India, and they dovetail pretty nearly with those of the Secret works.The latter, moreover, amplify them by a division into a number of esoteric cycles, never mentioned in Brahmanicalpopular writings -- one of which, the division of the Yugas into racial cycles, is given elsewhere as an instance. The rest,in their details, have of course never been made public. They are, nevertheless, known to every \"Twice-born\" (Dwija, orInitiated) Brahmin, and the Puranas contain references to some of them in veiled terms, which no matter-of-factOrientalist has yet endeavoured to make out, nor could he if he would.These sacred astronomical cycles are of immense antiquity, and most of them pertain, as stated, to the calculations ofNarada and Asuramaya. The latter has the reputation of a giant and a sorcerer. But the antediluvian giants (the Gibborimof the Bible) were not all bad or Sorcerers, as Christian Theology, which sees in every Occultist a servant of the Evil one,would have it; nor were they worse than many of \"the faithful sons of the Church.\" A Torquemada and a Catherine deMedicis certainly did more harm in their day and in the name of their Master than any Atlantean giant or demigod ofantiquity ever did; whether his name was Cyclops, or Medusa, or yet the Orphic Titan, the anguipedal monster known asEphialtes. There were good \"giants\" in days of old just as there are bad \"pigmies\" now; and the Rakshasas and Yakshasof Lanka are no worse than our modern dynamiters, and certain Christian and civilised generals during modern wars. Norare they myths. \"He who would laugh at Briareus and Orion ought to abstain from going to, or even talking of, Karnac orStonehenge,\" remarks somewhere a modern writer.As the Brahmanical figures given above are approximately the basic calculations of our esoteric system, the reader isrequested to carefully keep them in mind.In the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" one finds, as the last word of science, that the antiquity of man is allowed to stretch onlyover \"tens of thou-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 71 SCIENTIFIC SELF-COMPLACENCE.sands of years.\"* It becomes evident that as these figures may be made to fluctuate between 10,000 and 100,000,therefore they mean very little if anything, and only render still denser the darkness surrounding the question. Moreover,what matters it that science places the birth of man in the \"pre- or post-glacial drift,\" if we are told at the same time thatthe so-called \"ice age\" is simply a long succession of ages which \"shaded without abrupt change of any kind into what istermed the human or Recent period . . . the overlapping of geological periods having been the rule from the beginning oftime.\" The latter \"rule\" only results in the still more puzzling, even if strictly scientific and correct, information, that \"evento-day man is contemporary with the ice-age in the Alpine valleys and in the Finmark.\"**Thus, had it not been for the lessons taught by the Secret Doctrine, and even by exoteric Hinduism and its traditions, weshould be left to this day to float in perplexed uncertainty between the indefinite ages of one school of science, the \"tensof thousands\" of years of the other, and the 6,000 years of the Bible interpreters. This is one of the several reasons why,with all the respect due to the conclusions of the men of learning of our modern day, we are forced to ignore them in allsuch questions of pre-historic antiquity.Modern Geology and Anthropology must, of course, disagree with our views. But Occultism will find as many weaponsagainst these two sciences as it has against astronomical and physical theories, in spite of Mr. Laing's assurances that***\"in (chronological) calculations of this sort, concerning older and later formations, there is no theory, and they are basedon positive facts, limited only by a certain possible (?) amount of error either way,\" occultism will prove, scientificconfessions in hand, that geology is very much in error, and very often even more so than Astronomy. In this very"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"passage by Mr. Laing, which gives to Geology pre-eminence for correctness over Astronomy, we find a passage inflagrant contradiction to the admissions of the best Geologists themselves.

Nor would they fail to remind the Occultist and the Brahmin, that it is the modern men ofscience alone who represent exact science, whose duty it is to fight inaccuracy and superstition.The earth is passing through the \"habitable phase\" only for the present order of things, and as far as our present mankindis concerned with its actual \"coats of skin\" and phosphorus for bones and brain.We are ready to concede the 100 millions of years offered by Geology, since we are taught that our present physicalmankind -- or the Vaivasvata humanity -- began only 18 millions of years ago. But Geology has no facts to give us for theduration of geological periods, as we have shown, no more indeed than has Astronomy. The authentic letter from Mr. W.Pengelly, F.R.S., quoted elsewhere, says that: \"It is at present, and perhaps always will be, IMPOSSIBLE to reduce, evenapproximately, geological time into years or even into millenniums.\" And having never, hitherto, excavated a fossil man ofany other than the present form -- what does Geology know of him? It has traced zones or strata and, with these,primordial zoological life, down to the Silurian. When it has, in the same way, traced man down to his primordialprotoplasmic form, then we will admit that it may know something of primordial man. If it is not very material \"to thebearings of modern scientific discovery on modern thought,\" whether \"man has existed in state of constant though slowprogression for the last 50,000 years of period of 15 millions, or for the last 500,000 years of a period of 150 millions\"(\"Modern Science, etc.\" p. 49), as Mr. S. Laing tells his readers, it is very much so for the claims of the Occultists. Unlessthe latter show that it is a possibility, if not a perfect certainty, that man------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 73 COSMOGONY, AN INTELLIGENT PLAN.lived 18 millions of years ago, the Secret Doctrine might as well have remained unwritten. An attempt must, therefore, bemade in this direction, and it is our modern geologists and men of science generally who will be brought to testify to thisfact in the third part of this volume. Meanwhile, and notwithstanding the fact that Hindu Chronology is constantlyrepresented by the Orientalists as a fiction based on no \"actual computation,\"* but simply a \"childish boasting,\" it isnevertbeless often twisted out of recognition to make it yield to, and fit in with, Western theories. No figures have everbeen more meddled with and tortured than the famous 4, 3, 2, followed by cyphers of the Yugas and Maha-Yugas.As the whole cycle of prehistoric events, such as the evolution and transformation of Races and the extreme antiquity ofman, hangs upon the said Chronology, it becomes extremely important to check it by other existing calculations. If theEastern Chronology is rejected, we shall at least have the consolation of proving that no other -- whether the figures ofScience or of the Churches -- is one whit more reliable. As Professor Max Muller expresses it, it is often as useful toprove what a thing is not as to show what it may be. And once we succeed in pointing out the fallacies of both Christianand scientific computations -- by allowing them a fair chance of comparison with our Chronology -- neither of the two willhave a reasonable ground to stand upon, in pronouncing the esoteric figures less reliable than its own.We may here refer the reader to our earlier work \"Isis Unveiled,\" Vol. I., p. 32, for some remarks concerning the figureswhich were cited a few pages back.To-day a few more facts may be added to the information there given, which is already known to every Orientalist. Thesacredness of the cycle of 4320, with additional cyphers, lies in the fact that the figures which compose it, takenseparately or joined in various combinations, are each and all symbolical of the greatest mysteries in Nature. Indeed,whether one takes the 4 separately, or the 3 by itself, or the two together making 7, or again the three added together andyielding 9, all these numbers have their application in the most sacred and occult things, and record the workings ofNature in her eternally periodical phenomena. They are never erring, perpetually recurring numbers, unveiling, to him whostudies the secrets of Nature, a truly divine System, an intelligent plan in Cosmogony, which results in natural cosmic"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"divisions of times, seasons, invisible influences, astronomical phenomena, with their action and reaction on terrestrial andeven moral nature; on[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Wilson's \"Translation of Vishnu Purana,\" Vol. I., pp. 50, 51.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 74 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.birth, death, and growth, on health and disease. All these natural events are based and depend upon cyclical processesin the Kosmos itself, producing periodic agencies which, acting from without, affect the Earth and all that lives andbreathes on it, from one end to the other of any Manvantara. Causes and effects are esoteric, exoteric, and endexoteric,so to say.In Isis Unveiled we wrote that which we now repeat:-- \"We are at the bottom of a cycle and evidently in a transitory state.Plato divides the intellectual progress of the universe during every cycle into fertile and barren periods. In the sublunaryregions, the spheres of the various elements remain eternally in perfect harmony with the divine nature, he says; 'but theirparts,' owing to a too close proximity to earth, and their commingling with the earthly (which is matter, and therefore therealm of evil), 'are sometimes according, and sometimes contrary to (divine) nature.' When those circulations -- whichEliphas Levi calls ' currents of the astral light' -- in the universal ether which contains in itself every element, take place inharmony with the divine spirit, our earth and everything pertaining to it enjoys a fertile period. The occult powers of plants,animals, and minerals magically sympathize with the ' superior natures,' and the divine soul of man is in perfectintelligence with these 'inferior' ones. But during the barren periods, the latter lose their magic sympathy, and the spiritualsight of the majority of mankind is so blinded as to lose every notion of the superior powers of its own divine spirit. We arein a barren period: the eighteenth century, during which the malignant fever of scepticism broke out so irrepressibly, hasentailed unbelief as an hereditary disease upon the nineteenth. The divine intellect is veiled in man; his animal brainalone philosophizes.\" And philosophizing alone, how can it understand the \"SOUL DOCTRINE\"?In order not to break the thread of the narrative we shall give some striking proofs of these cyclic laws in Part II.,proceeding meanwhile with our explanations of geological and racial cycles.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 75 THE SECRET OF THE FALL OF THE ANGELS.STANZA III.ATTEMPTS TO CREATE MAN.§§ (11) The Descent of the Demiurge.

All in the ancient Scriptures is allegorical -- all based uponand inseparably connected with Astronomy and Cosmolatry.-------13. THEY (the Moon-gods) WENT, EACH ON HIS ALLOTTED LAND: SEVEN OF THEM, EACH ON HIS LOT. THELORDS OF THE FLAME REMAINED BEHIND. THEY WOULD NOT GO, THEY WOULD NOT CREATE (a).(a) The Secret teachings show the divine Progenitors creating men on seven portions of the globe \"each on his lot\" -- i.e.,each a different race of men externally and internally, and on different zones. This polygenistic claim is consideredelsewhere (vide Stanza VII.). But who are \"They\" who create, and the \"Lords of the Flame,\" \"who do not\"? Occultismdivides the \"Creators\" into twelve classes; of which four have reached liberation to the end of the \"Great Age,\" the fifth isready to reach it, but still remains active on the intellectual planes, while seven are still under direct Karmic law. Theselast act on the man-bearing globes of our chain.Exoteric Hindu books mention seven classes of Pitris, and among them two distinct kinds of Progenitors or Ancestors: theBarhishad and the Agnishwatta; or those possessed of the \"sacred fire\" and those devoid of it. Hindu ritualism seems toconnect them with sacrificial fires, and with Grihasta Brahmins in earlier incarnations: those who have, and those whohave not attended as they should to their household sacred fires in their previous births. The distinction, as said, isderived from the Vedas. The first and highest class (esoterically) the Agnishwatta,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Masonic Review\"; Cincinnati, June 1886, Art. \"The Cabbalah.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 78 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.are represented in the exoteric allegory as Grihasta (Brahman-householders) who, in their past births in otherManvantaras having failed to maintain their domestic fires and to offer burnt sacrifices, have lost every right to haveoblations with fire presented to them. Whereas the Barhishad, being Brahmins who have kept up their household sacredfires, are thus honoured to this day. Thence the Agnishwatta are represented as devoid of, and the Barhishad aspossessed of, fires.But esoteric philosophy explains the original qualifications as being due to the difference between the natures of the twoclasses: the Agnishwatta Pitris are devoid of fire (i.e., of creative passion), because too divine and pure (vide supra, Sloka11th); whereas the Barhishad, being the lunar spirits more closely connected with Earth, became the creative Elohim ofform, or the Adam of dust.The allegory says that Sanandana and other Vedhas, the Sons of Brahma, his first progeny, \"were without desire orpassion, inspired with the holy wisdom, estranged from the Universe and undesirous of progeny\" (Vishnu Purana, Book I.vii.). This also is what is meant in Sloka 11 by the words: \"They would not create,\" and is explained as follows:-- \"Theprimordial Emanations from the creative Power are too near the absolute Cause. They are transitional and latent forces,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"which will develop only in the next and subsequent removes.\" This makes it plain. Hence Brahma is said to have feltwrathful when he saw that those \"embodied spirits, produced from his limbs (gatra), would not multiply themselves.\" Afterwhich, in the allegory, he creates other seven mind-born Sons (see \"Moksha-Darma\" and \"Mahabharata\"), namely,Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasishta, the latter being often replaced by Daksha, the most prolific ofthe creators. In most of the texts these Seven Sons of Vasishta-Daksha are called the seven Rishis of the ThirdManvantara; the latter referring both to the Third Round and also to the third Root-Race and its branch-Races in theFourth Round. These are all the creators of the various beings on this Earth, the Prajapati, and at the same time theyappear as divers reincarnations in the early Manvantaras or races.It thus becomes clear why the Agnishwatta, devoid of the grosser creative fire, hence unable to create physical man,having no double, or astral body, to project, since they were without any form, are shown in exoteric allegories as Yogis,Kumaras (chaste youths), who became \"rebels,\" Asuras, fighting and opposing gods,* etc., etc. Yet it is they[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Because, as the allegory shows, the Gods who had no personal merit of their own, dreading the sanctity of those self-striving incarnated Beings who had become ascetics and Yogis, and thus threatened to upset the power of the former bytheir self-acquired powers -- renounced them. All this has a deep philosophical meaning and refers to the evolution andacquirement of divine powers through self-exertion. Some Rishi- [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 79 THE LIVING SPIRITUAL FIRE.alone who could complete man, i.e., make of him a self-conscious, almost a divine being -- god on Earth. The Barhishad,though possessed of creative fire, were devoid of the higher MAHAT-mic element. Being on a level with the lowerprinciples -- those which precede gross objective matter -- they could only give birth to the outer man, or rather to themodel of the physical, the astral man. Thus, though we see them intrusted with the task by Brahma (the collective Mahator Universal Divine Mind), the \"Mystery of Creation\" is repeated on Earth, only in an inverted sense, as in a mirror. It isthose who are unable to create the spiritual immortal man, who project the senseless model (the Astral) of the physicalBeing; and, as will be seen, it was those who would not multiply, who sacrificed themselves to the good and salvation ofSpiritual Humanity. For, to complete the septenary man, to add to his three lower principles and cement them with thespiritual Monad -- which could never dwell in such a form otherwise than in an absolutely latent state -- two connectingprinciples are needed: Manas and Kama. This requires a living Spiritual Fire of the middle principle from the fifth and thirdstates of Pleroma. But this fire is the possession of the Triangles, not of the (perfect) Cubes, which symbolize the AngelicBeings:* the former having from the first creation got hold of it and being said to have appropriated it for themselves, as inthe allegory of Prometheus. These are the active, and therefore -- in Heaven -- no longer \"pure\" Beings. They havebecome the independent and free Intelligences, shown in every Theogony as fighting for that independence and freedom,and hence -- in the ordinary sense -- \"rebellious to the divine passive law.\" These are then those \"Flames\" (theAgnishwatta) who, as shown in Sloka 13, \"remain behind\" instead of going along with the others to create men on Earth.But the true esoteric meaning is that most of them were destined to incarnate as the Egos of the forthcoming crop ofMankind. The human Ego is neither Atman nor Buddhi, but the higher Manas: the intellectual fruition and theefflorescence of the intellectual self-conscious Egotism -- in the higher spiritual sense. The ancient works refer to it asKarana Sarira on the plane of Sutratma, which is the golden thread on which, like beads, the various personalities of thishigher Ego are strung. If the reader were told, as in the semi-esoteric allegories, that these Beings were returningNirvanees, from preceding Maha-Manvantaras -- ages of incalculable dura-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Yogis are shown in the Puranas to be far more powerful than the gods.Secondary gods or temporary powers in Nature (the Forces) are doomed to disappear; it is only the spiritual potentiality inman which can lead him to become one with the INFINITE and the ABSOLUTE.* See Book I., Stanzas III. to V. The triangle becomes a Pentagon (five-fold) on Earth.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 80 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.tion which have rolled away in the Eternity, a still more incalculable time ago -- he would hardly understand the textcorrectly; while some Vedantins might say: \"This is not so; the Nirvanee can never return\"; which is true during theManvantara he belongs to, and erroneous where Eternity is concerned. For it is said in the Sacred Slokas:\"The thread of radiance which is imperishable and dissolves only in Nirvana, re-emerges from it in its integrity on the daywhen the Great Law calls all things back into action. . . .\"Hence, as the higher \"Pitris or Dhyanis\" had no hand in his physical creation, we find primeval man, issued from thebodies of his spiritually fireless progenitors, described as aeriform, devoid of compactness, and MINDLESS. He had nomiddle principle to serve him as a medium between the highest and the lowest, the spiritual man and the physical brain,for he lacked Manas. The Monads which incarnated in those empty SHELLS, remained as unconscious as whenseparated from their previous incomplete forms and vehicles. There is no potentiality for creation, or self-Consciousness,in a pure Spirit on this our plane, unless its too homogeneous, perfect, because divine, nature is, so to say, mixed with,and strengthened by, an essence already differentiated. It is only the lower line of the Triangle -- representing the firsttriad that emanates from the Universal MONAD -- that can furnish this needed consciousness on the plane ofdifferentiated Nature. But how could these pure Emanations, which, on this principle, must have originally beenthemselves unconscious (in our sense), be of any use in supplying the required principle, as they could hardly havepossessed it themselves? The answer is difficult to comprehend, unless one is well acquainted with the philosophicalmetaphysics of a beginningless and endless series of Cosmic Re-births; and becomes well impressed and familiarisedwith that immutable law of Nature which is ETERNAL MOTION, cyclic and spiral, therefore progressive even in itsseeming retrogression. The one divine Principle, the nameless THAT of the Vedas, is the universal Total, which, neither"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"in its spiritual aspects and emanations, nor in its physical atoms, can ever be at \"absolute rest\" except during the \"Nights\"of Brahma. Hence, also, the \"first-born\" are those who are first set in motion at the beginning of a Manvantara, and thusthe first to fall into the lower spheres of materiality. They who are called in Theology \"the Thrones,\" and are the \"Seat ofGod,\" must be the first incarnated men on Earth; and it becomes comprehensible, if we think of the endless series of pastManvantaras, to find that the last had to come first, and the first last. We find, in short, that the higher Angels had broken,countless aeons before, through the \"Seven Circles,\" and thus robbed them of the Sacred fire;------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 81 MAN, A GOD IN ANIMAL FORM.which means in plain words, that they had assimilated during their past incarnations, in lower as well as in higher worlds,all the wisdom therefrom -- the reflection of MAHAT in its various degrees of intensity. No Entity, whether angelic orhuman, can reach the state of Nirvana, or of absolute purity, except through aeons of suffering and the knowledge ofEVIL as well as of good, as otherwise the latter remains incomprehensible.Between man and the animal -- whose Monads (or Jivas) are fundamentally identical -- there is the impassable abyss ofMentality and Self-consciousness. What is human mind in its higher aspect, whence comes it, if it is not a portion of theessence -- and, in some rare cases of incarnation, the very essence -- of a higher Being: one from a higher and divineplane? Can man -- a god in the animal form -- be the product of Material Nature by evolution alone, even as is the animal,which differs from man in external shape, but by no means in the materials of its physical fabric, and is informed by thesame, though undeveloped, Monad -- seeing that the intellectual potentialities of the two differ as the Sun does from theGlow-worm? And what is it that creates such difference, unless man is an animal plus a living god within his physicalshell? Let us pause and ask ourselves seriously the question, regardless of the vagaries and sophisms of both thematerialistic and the psychological modern sciences.To some extent, it is admitted that even the esoteric teaching is allegorical. To make the latter comprehensible to theaverage intelligence, requires the use of symbols cast in an intelligible form. Hence the allegorical and semi-mythicalnarratives in the exoteric, and the (only) semi-metaphysical and objective representations in the esoteric teachings. Forthe purely and transcendentally spiritual conceptions are adapted only to the perceptions of those who \"see without eyes,hear without ears, and sense without organs,\" according to the graphic expression of the Commentary. The too puritanidealist is at liberty to spiritualise the tenet, whereas the modern psychologist would simply try to spirit away our \"fallen,\"yet still divine, human Soul in its connection with Buddhi.The mystery attached to the highly spiritual ancestors of the divine man within the earthly man is very great. His dualcreation is hinted at in the Puranas, though its esoteric meaning can be approached only by collating together the manyvarying accounts, and reading them in their symbolical and allegorical character. So it is in the Bible, both in Genesis andeven in the Epistles of Paul. For that creator, who is called in the second chapter of Genesis the \"Lord God,\" is in theoriginal the Elohim, or Gods (the Lords), in the plural; and while one of them makes the earthly Adam of dust, the otherbreathes into him the breath of life, and the third makes of him a living soul (ii. 7), all of which readings------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 82 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.are implied in the plural number of the Elohim.* \"The first man is of the Earth, the second (the last, or rather highest) isfrom heaven,\" says Paul in I. Corinthians xv. 47.In the Aryan allegory the rebellious Sons of Brahma are all represented as holy ascetics and Yogis. Re-born in everyKalpa, they generally try to impede the work of human procreation. When Daksha, the chief of the Prajapati (creators),brings forth 10,000 sons for the purpose of peopling the world, Narada -- a son of Brahma, the great Rishi, and virtually a\"Kumara,\" if not so in name -- interferes with, and twice frustrates Daksha's aim, by persuading those Sons to remain holyascetics and eschew marriage. For this, Daksha curses Narada to be re-born as a man, as Brahma had cursed himbefore for refusing to marry, and obtain progeny, saying:-- \"Perish in thy present (Deva or angelic) form and take up thyabode in the womb,\" i.e., become a man (Vayu Purana; Harivamsa, 170). Notwithstanding several conflicting versions ofthe same story, it is easy to see that Narada belongs to that class of Brahma's, \"first-born,\" who have all proven rebelliousto the law of animal procreation, for which they had to incarnate as men. Of all the Vedic Rishis, Narada, as alreadyshown, is the most incomprehensible, because the most closely connected with the occult doctrines -- especially with thesecret cycles and Kalpas (vide supra).Certain contradictory statements about this Sage have much distracted the Orientalists. Thus he is shown as refusingpositively to create (have progeny), and even as calling his father Brahma \"a false teacher\" for advising him to getmarried (\"Narada-Pancha-Ratra\"); nevertheless, he is referred to as one of the Prajapati, \"progenitors\"! In NaradiyaPurana, he describes the laws and the duties of the celibate adepts; and as these occult duties do not happen to befound in the fragment of about 3,000 Stanzas in the possession of European museums, the Brahmins are proclaimedliars; the Orientalists forgetting that the Naradiya is credited with containing 25,000 Stanzas, and that it is not very likelythat such MSS. should be found in the hands of the Hindu profane, those who are ready to sell any precious olla for a redpottage. Suffice it to say, that Narada is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Seth, as Bunsen and others have shown, is not only the primitive god of the Semites -- early Jews included -- but alsotheir \"semi-divine ancestor.\" For, says Bunsen (\"God in History,\" vol. i, pp. 233, 234), \"the Seth of Genesis, the father ofEnoch (the man) must be considered as originally running parallel with that derived from the Elohim, Adam's father.\"\"According to Bunsen, the Deity (the god Seth) was the primitive god of Northern Egypt and Palestine\" (Staniland Wake,\"The Great Pyramid\"). And Seth became considered in the later Theology of the Egyptians as \"AN EVIL DAEMON,\" saysthe same Bunsen, for he is one with Typhon and one with the Hindu demons as a logical sequel.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 83 \"FIRES,\" \"SPARKS,\" AND \"FLAMES.\""},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"the Deva-Rishi of Occultism par excellence; and that the Occultist who does not ponder, analyse, and study Narada fromhis seven esoteric facets, will never be able to fathom certain anthropological, chronological, and even Cosmic Mysteries.He is one of the Fires above-mentioned, and plays a part in the evolution of this Kalpa from its incipient, down to its finalstage. He is an actor who appears in each of the successive acts (Root-Races) of the present Manvantaric drama, in theworld allegories which strike the key-note of esotericism, and are now becoming more familiar to the reader. But shall weturn to other ancient Scriptures and documents for the corroboration of the \"Fires,\" \"Sparks,\" and \"Flames?\" They areplentiful, if one only seeks for them in the right places. In the \"Book of the Concealed Mystery,\" they are clearlyenunciated, as also in the \"Ha Idra Zuta Qadisha,\" or the lesser holy Assembly. The language is very mystical and veiled,yet still comprehensible. Therein, among the sparks of Prior Worlds, \"vibrating Flames and Sparks,\" from the divine flint,the workmen proceed to create man, \"male and female\" (427); which \"Flames and Sparks\" (Angels and their Worlds,Stars and Planets) are said, figuratively, to \"become extinct and die,\" that is to say, remain unmanifested until a certainprocess of nature is accomplished. To show how thickly veiled from public view are the most important facts ofanthropogenesis, two passages are now quoted from two Kabalistic books. The first is from the Book of the ConcealedMystery:--(429.) From a Light-Bearer (one of the seven sacred planets) of insupportable brightness proceeded a radiating Flame,dashing off, like a vast and mighty hammer, those sparks which were the prior worlds.(430.) And with most subtle ether were these intermingled and bound mutually together, but only when they wereconjoined together, even the great Father and great Mother.(431.) From Hoa, himself, is AB, the Father; and from Hoa, himself, is RUACH, the Spirit; who are hidden in the Ancientof Days, and therein is that Ether concealed.(432.) And it was connected with a Light-Bearer (a planet and its angel or regent), which went forth from that Light-Bearerof insupportable brightness, which is hidden in the bosom of Aima, the Great Mother.*Now the following extract from the Zohar** also deals with the same mystery:-- \"The Pre-Adamite Kings. 'We havelearned in the Siphrah D'Tzniootha: That the At-tee'kah DAt-tee'keen, Ancient of Ancients, before He prepared his Form,built Kings, and engraved[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Mr. Mather's \"Kabbalah Unveiled.\"** Translated in I. Myer's Qabbalah.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 84 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Kings, and sketched out Kings (men, the Kings of the animals), and they could not exist: till he overthrew them and hidthem until after a time, therefore it is written: 'And these are the Kings which reigned in the land of Edom' . . . . And theycould not exist till Resha'Hiv'rah, the White Head, the At'-tee-'kah D'At-tee'keen, Ancient of Ancients, arranged Himself . .. . and formed all forms above and below. . . . Before He arranged himself in his Form had not been formed all thosewhom he desired to form, and all worlds have been destroyed . . . . they did not remain in their places, because the formof the Kings had not been formed as it ought to be, and the Holy City had not been prepared.\" (Zohar iii., 135a; 292a IdraZootah. Brody, etc.)Now the plain meaning of these two allegorical and metaphysical disquisitions is simply this: Worlds and men were in turnformed and destroyed, under the law of evolution and from pre-existing material, until both the planets and their men, inour case our Earth and its animal and human races, became what they are now in the present cycle: opposite polarforces, an equilibrized compound of Spirit and Matter, of the positive and the negative, of the male and the female. Beforeman could become male and female physically, his prototype, the creating Elohim, had to arrange his Form on this sexualplane astrally. That is to say, the atoms and the organic forces, descending into the plane of the given differentiation, hadto be marshalled in the order intended by Nature, so as to be ever carrying out, in an immaculate way, that law which theKabala calls the Balance, through which everything that exists does so as male and female in its final perfection, in thispresent stage of materiality. Chochmah, Wisdom, the Male Sephiroth, had to diffuse itself in, and through, Binah,intelligent Nature, or Understanding. Therefore the First Root-race of men, sexless and mindless, had to be overthrownand \"hidden until after a time\"; i.e., the first race, instead of dying, disappeared in the second race, as certain lower livesand plants do in their progeny. It was a wholesale transformation. The First became the Second Root-race, without eitherbegetting it, procreating it, or dying. \"They passed by together,\" as it is written: \"And he died and another reigned in hisstead\" (Genesis xxvi. 31 et seq. Zohar iii., 292a). Why? Because \"the Holy City had not been prepared.\" And what is the\"Holy City\"? The Maquom (the Secret Place or the Shrine) on Earth: in other words, the human womb, the microcosmiccopy and reflection of the Heavenly Matrix, the female space or primeval Chaos, in which the male Spirit fecundates thegerm of the Son, or the visible Universe.* So much so, that in the paragraph on \"the Emanation of the Male and FemalePrinciples\" in the Zohar[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide \"The Holy of Holies: its esoteric meaning,\" in Part IO of this Volume.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 85 THE SON OF YAH.(ibid.), it is said that, on this earth, the WISDOM from the \"Holy Ancient\" \"does not shine except in male and female.\"\"Hohmah, Wisdom, is the Father, and BINAH, understanding, is the Mother . . . . and when they connect one with theother they bring forth and diffuse and emanate truth.

This is the completeness of the whole.\"*This is also the \"completeness\" of phallicism by the Rabbis, its perfect apotheosis, the divine being dragged into theanimal, the sublime into the grossness of the terrestrial. Nothing so graphically gross exists in Eastern Occultism, nor inthe primitive Kabala -- the \"Chaldean Book of Numbers.\" We have said so in \"Isis Unveiled\":--\"We find it rather unwise on the part of Catholic writers to pour out their vials of wrath in such sentences as these: 'In amultitude of pagodas, the phallic stone, ever and always assuming, like the Grecian batylos, the brutally indecent form ofthe lingham . . . the Maha Deva.' Before casting slurs on a symbol whose profound metaphysical meaning is too much forthe modern champions of that religion of sensualism par excellence, Roman Catholicism, to grasp, they are in duty boundto destroy their oldest churches, and change the form of the cupolas of their own temples. The Mahody of Elephanta, theRound Tower of Bhangulpore, the minarets of Islam -- either rounded or pointed -- are the originals of the Campanilecolumn of San Marco, at Venice, of the Rochester Cathedral, and of the modern Duomo of Milan. All of these steeples,turrets, domes, and Christian temples, are the reproductions of the primitive idea of the lithos, the upright phallus.\" (Vol.II., p. 5.)Nevertheless, and however it may be, the fact that all these Hebrew Elohim, Sparks, and Cherubs are identical with theDevas, Rishis and the Fires and Flames, the Rudras and the forty-nine Agnis of the ancient Aryas, is sufficiently provenby and in the Kabala.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Zohar iii., 290a, quoted in Isaac Myer's Qabbalah, p. 387.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 86 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.STANZA IV.CREATION OF THE FIRST RACES.§§ (14) Creation of men.

THE SEVEN HOSTS, THE \"WILL (or Mind)-BORN\" LORDS, PROPELLED BY THE SPIRIT OF LIFE-GIVING (Fohat),SEPARATE MEN FROM THEMSELVES, EACH ON HIS OWN ZONE (a).(a) They threw off their \"shadows\" or astral bodies -- if such an ethereal being as a \"lunar Spirit\" may be supposed torejoice in an astral, besides a hardly tangible body. In another Commentary it is said that the \"Ancestors\" breathed out thefirst man, as Brahma is explained to have breathed out the Suras (Gods), when they became \"Asuras\" (from Asu, breath).In a third it is said that they, the newly-created men, \"were the shadows of the Shadows.\"With regard to this sentence -- \"They were the shadows of the Shadows\" -- a few more words may be said and a fullerexplanation attempted. This first process of the evolution of mankind is far easier to accept than the one which follows it,though one and all will be rejected and doubted even by some Kabalists, especially the Western, who study the presenteffects, but have neglected to study their primary causes. Nor does the writer feel competent to explain a mode ofprocreation so difficult of appreciation save for an Eastern Occultist. Therefore it is useless to enter here into detailsconcerning the process, though it is minutely described in the Secret Books, as it would only lead to speaking of factshitherto unknown to the profane world, and hence to their being misunderstood. An \"Adam\" made of the dust of theground will always be found preferable, by a certain class of students, to one projected out of the ethereal body of hiscreator; though the former process has never been heard of, while the latter is familiar, as all know, to many Spiritualistsin Europe and America, who, of all men, ought to understand it. For who of those who have witnessed the phenomenonof a materialising form oozing out of the pores of a medium or, at other times, out of his left side, can fail to credit thepossibility, at least, of such a birth? If there are------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 87 MAN NOT CREATED PERFECT.in the Universe such beings as Angels or Spirits, whose incorporeal essence may constitute an intelligent entitynotwithstanding the absence of any (to us) solid organism; and if there are those who believe that a god made the firstman out of dust, and breathed into him a living Soul -- and there are millions upon millions who believe both -- what doesthis doctrine of ours contain that is so impossible? Very soon the day will dawn, when the world will have to choosewhether it will accept the miraculous creation of man (and Kosmos too) out of nothing, according to the dead letter ofGenesis, or a first man born from a fantastic link -- absolutely \"missing\" so far -- the common ancestor of man, and of the\"true ape.\"* Between these two fallacies,** Occult philosophy steps in. It teaches that the first human stock was projectedby higher and semi-divine Beings out of their own essences. If the latter process is to be considered as abnormal or eveninconceivable -- because obsolete in Nature at this point of evolution -- it is yet proven possible on the authority of certain\"Spiritualistic\" FACTS. Which, then, we ask of the three hypotheses or theories is the most reasonable and the leastabsurd? Certainly no one -- provided he is not a soul-blind materialist -- can ever object to the occult teaching.Now, as shown, we gather from the latter that man was not \"created\" the complete being he is now, however imperfect hestill remains. There was a spiritual, a psychic, an intellectual, and an animal evolution, from the highest to the lowest, aswell as a physical development -- from the simple and homogeneous, up to the more complex and heterogeneous;though not quite on the lines traced for us by the modern evolutionists.

The Esotericism of both is at onewith our Secret Doctrine, however much the form may differ and vary.-------ON THE IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCES OF THE INCARNATING POWERS.THE Progenitors of Man, called in India \"Fathers,\" Pitara or Pitris, are the creators of our bodies and lower principles.They are ourselves, as the first personalities, and we are they. Primeval man would be \"the bone of their bone and theflesh of their flesh,\" if they had body and flesh. As stated, they were \"lunar Beings.\" The Endowers of man with his conscious, immortal EGO, are the \"Solar Angels\" -- whether so regarded metaphoricallyor literally. The mysteries of the Conscious EGO or human Soul are great. The esoteric name of these \"Solar Angels\" is,literally, the \"Lords\" (Nath) of \"persevering ceaseless devotion\" (pranidhana). Therefore they of the fifth principle (Manas)seem to be connected with, or to have originated the system of the Yogis who make of pranidhana their fifth observance(see Yoga Shastra, II., 32.) It has already been explained why the trans-Himalayan Occultists regard them as evidentlyidentical with those who in India are termed Kumaras, Agnishwattas, and the Barhishads.How precise and true is Plato's expression, how profound and philosophical his remark on the (human) soul or EGO,when he defined it as \"a compound of the same and the other.\" And yet how little this hint has been understood, since theworld took it to mean that the soul was the breath of God, of Jehovah. It is \"the same and the other,\" as the great Initiate-Philosopher said; for the EGO (the \"Higher Self\" when merged with and in the Divine Monad) is Man, and yet the same asthe \"OTHER,\" the Angel in him incarnated, as the same with the universal MAHAT. The great classics and philosophersfelt this truth, when saying that \"there must be something within us which produces our thoughts. Something very subtle;it is a breath; it is fire; it is ether;------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 89 PITRIS OF THE GODS AND DEMONS.it is quintessence; it is a slender likeness; it is an intellection; it is a number; it is harmony. . . . . \" (Voltaire).All these are the Manasam and Rajasas: the Kumaras, Asuras, and other rulers and Pitris, who incarnated in the ThirdRace, and in this and various other ways endowed mankind with Mind.There are seven classes of Pitris, as shown below, three incorporeal and four corporeal; and two kinds, the Agnishwattaand the Barhishad. And we may add that, as there are two kinds of Pitris, so there is a double and a triple set ofBarhishad and Agnishwatta. The former, having given birth to their astral doubles, are reborn as Sons of Atri, and are the\"Pitris of the Demons,\" or corporeal beings, on the authority of Manu (III., 196); while the Agnishwatta are reborn as Sonsof Marichi (a son of Brahma), and are the Pitris of the Gods (Manu again, Matsya and Padma Puranas and Kulluka in theLaws of the Manavas, III., 195).* Moreover, the Vayu Purana declares all the seven orders to have originally been the firstgods, the Vairajas, whom Brahma \"with the eye of Yoga, beheld in the eternal spheres, and who are the gods of gods\";and the Matsya adds that the Gods worshipped them; while the Harivansa (S. 1, 935) distinguishes the Virajas as oneclass of the Pitris only -- a statement corroborated in the Secret Teachings, which, however, identify the Virajas with theelder Agnishwattas** and the Rajasas, or Abhutarajasas, who are incorporeal without even an astral phantom. Vishnu issaid, in most of the MSS., to have incarnated in and through them. \"In the Raivata Manvantara, again, Hari, best of gods,was born of Sambhuti, as the divine Manasas -- originating with the deities called Rajasas.\" Sambhuti was a daughter ofDaksha, and wife of Marichi, the father of the Agnishwatta, who, along with the Rajasas, are ever associated withManasas. As remarked by a far more able Sanskritist than Wilson, Mr. Fitzedward Hall, \"Manasa is no inappropriatename for a deity associated with the Rajasas. We appear to have in it Manasam -- the same as Manas -- with the change"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"of termination required to express male personification\" (Vishnu Purana Bk. III., ch. I., p. 17 footnote). All the sons ofViraja are Manasa, says Nilakantha. And[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We are quite aware that the Yayu and Matsya Puranas identify (agreeably to Western interpretation) the Agnishwattawith the seasons, and the Barhishad Pitris with the months; adding a fourth class -- the Kavyas -- cyclic years. But do notChristian, Roman Catholics identify their Angels with planets, and are not the seven Rishis become the Saptarshi -- aconstellation? They are deities presiding over all the cyclic divisions.** The Vayu Purana shows the region called Viraja-loka inhabited by the Agnishwattas.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 90 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Viraja is Brahma, and, therefore, the incorporeal Pitris are called Vairajas from being the sons of Viraja, says VayuPurana.We could multiply our proofs ad infinitum, but it is useless. The wise will understand our meaning, the unwise are notrequired to. There are thirty-three crores, or 330 millions, of gods in India. But, as remarked by the learned lecturer on theBhagavad Gita, \"they may be all devas, but are by no means all 'gods', in the high spiritual sense one attributes to theterm.\" \"This is an unfortunate blunder,\" he remarks, \"generally committed by Europeans. Deva is a kind of spiritual being,and because the same word is used in ordinary parlance to mean god, it by no means follows that we have to worshipthirty-three crores of gods.\" And he adds suggestively: \"These beings, as may be naturally inferred have a certain affinitywith one of the three component Upadhis (basic principles) into which we have divided man.\" -- (Vide Theosophist, Feb.,1887, et seq.)The names of the deities of a certain mystic class change with every Manvantara. Thus the twelve great gods, Jayas,created by Brahma to assist him in the work of creation in the very beginning of the Kalpa, and who, lost in Samadhi,neglected to create -- whereupon they were cursed to be repeatedly born in each Manvantara till the seventh -- arerespectively called Ajitas, Tushitas, Satyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sadhyas, and Adityas: they are Tushitas (in the secondKalpa), and Adityas in this Vaivasvata period (see Vayu Purana), besides other names for each age. But they areidentical with the Manasa or Rajasas, and these with our incarnating Dhyan Chohans. They are all classes of the Gnana-devas.Yes; besides those beings, who, like the Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinaras, etc., etc., taken in their individualities, inhabitthe astral plane, there are real Devagnanams, and to these classes of Devas belong the Adityas, the Vairajas, theKumaras, the Asuras, and all those high celestial beings whom Occult teaching calls Manaswin, the Wise, foremost of all,and who would have made all men the self-conscious spiritually intellectual beings they will be, had they not been\"cursed\" to fall into generation, and to be reborn themselves as mortals for their neglect of duty.-------STANZA IV. -- (Continued.)15.

THEIR PROGENY WERE BHUTA (phantoms) WITH NEITHER FORM NOR MIND, THEREFORE THEY WERECALLED THE CHHAYA (image or shadow) RACE (c).(a) Manu, as already remarked, comes from the root \"man\" to think, hence \"a thinker.\" It is from this Sanskrit word verylikely that sprung the Latin \"mens,\" mind, the Egyptian \"Menes,\" the \"Master-Mind,\" the Pythagorean Monas, or conscious\"thinking unit,\" mind also, and even our \"Manas\" or mind, the fifth principle in man. Hence these shadows are calledamanasa, \"mindless.\"With the Brahmins the Pitris are very sacred, because they are the Progenitors,* or ancestors of men -- the firstManushya on this Earth -- and offerings are made to them by the Brahmin when a son is born unto him. They are morehonoured and their ritual is more important than the worship of the gods (See the \"Laws of Manu,\" Bk. III., p. 203).May we not now search for a philosophical meaning in this dual group of progenitors?The Pitris being divided into seven classes, we have here the mystic number again. Nearly all the Puranas agree thatthree of these are arupa, formless, while four are corporeal; the former being intellectual and spiritual, the latter materialand devoid of intellect. Esoterically, it is the Asuras who form the first three classes of Pitris -- \"born in the body of night\" --whereas the other four were produced from the body of twilight. Their fathers, the gods, were doomed to be born fools onEarth, according to Vayu Purana. The legends are purposely mixed up and made very hazy: the Pitris being in one thesons of the gods, and, in another those of Brahma; while a third makes them instructors of their own fathers. It is theHosts of the four material classes who create men simultaneously on the seven zones.Now, with regard to the seven classes of Pitris, each of which is again divided into seven, a word to students and a queryto the profane. That class of the \"Fire Dhyanis,\" which we identify on undeniable grounds with the Agnishwattas, is calledin our school the \"Heart\" of the Dhyan-Chohanic Body; and it is said to have incarnated in the third race of men and made"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"them perfect.

In Manava-Dharma-Sastra they are called the Lunar ancestors.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 92 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.every physical organ, and psychic, and spiritual function, is a reflection, so to say, a copy on the terrestrial plane of themodel or prototype above. Why, it is asked, should there be such a strange repetition of the number seven in theanatomical structure of man? Why should the heart have four lower \"cavities and three higher divisions,\" answering sostrangely to the septenary division of the human principles, separated into two groups, the higher and the lower; and whyshould the same division be found in the various classes of Pitris, and especially our Fire Dhyanis? For, as alreadystated, these Beings fall into four corporeal (or grosser) and three incorporeal (or subtler) \"principles,\" or call them by anyother name you please. Why do the seven nervous plexuses of the body radiate seven rays? Why are there these sevenplexuses, and why seven distinct layers in the human skin?\"Having projected their shadows and made men of one element (ether), the progenitors re-ascend to Maha-loka, whencethey descend periodically, when the world is renewed, to give birth to new men.\"The subtle bodies remain without understanding (Manas) until the advent of the Suras (Gods) now called Asuras (notGods),\" says the Commentary.\"Not-gods,\" for the Brahmins, perhaps, but the highest Breaths, for the Occultist; since those progenitors (Pitar), theformless and the intellectual, refuse to build man, but endow him with mind; the four corporeal classes creating only hisbody.This is very plainly shown in various texts of the Rig Veda -- the highest authority for a Hindu of any sect whatever.Therein Asura means \"spiritual divine,\" and the word is used as a synonym for Supreme Spirit, while in the sense of a\"God,\" the term \"Asura\" is applied to Varuna and Indra and pre-eminently to Agni -- the three having been in days of oldthe three highest gods, before Brahmanical Theo-Mythology distorted the true meaning of almost everything in theArchaic Scriptures. But, as the key is now lost, the Asuras are hardly mentioned.In the Zendavesta the same is found. In the Mazdean, or Magian, religion, \"Asura\" is the lord Asura Visvavedas, the \"all-knowing\" or \"omniscient Lord\"; and Asura-Mazdha, become later Ahura-Mazdha, is, as Benfey shows, \"the Lord whobestows Intelligence\" -- Asura-Medha and Ahura-Mazdao. Elsewhere in this work it is shown, on equally good authority,that the Indo-Iranian Asura was always regarded as sevenfold. This fact, combined with the name Mazdha, as above,which makes of the sevenfold Asura the \"Lord,\" or \"Lords\" collectively \"who bestow Intelligence,\" connects theAmshaspends with the Asuras and with our incarnating Dhyan Chohans, as well as with the Elohim, and the seveninforming gods of Egypt, Chaldea, and every other country.Why these \"gods\" refused to create men is not, as stated in exoteric------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 93 A GRAND APOCALYPTIC METAPHOR.accounts, because their pride was too great to share the celestial power of their essence with the children of Earth, but forreasons already suggested. However, allegory has indulged in endless fancies and theology taken advantage thereof inevery country to make out its case against these first-born, or the logoi, and to impress it as a truth on the minds of theignorant and credulous. (Compare also what is said about Makara and the Kumaras in connection with the Zodiac.)The Christian system is not the only one which has degraded them into demons. Zoroastrianism and even Brahmanismhave profited thereby to obtain hold over the people's mind. Even in Chaldean exotericism, Beings who refuse to create,i.e., who are said to oppose thereby the Demiurgos, are also denounced as the Spirits of Darkness. The Suras, who wintheir intellectual independence, fight the Suras who are devoid thereof, who are shown as passing their lives in profitlessceremonial worship based on blind faith -- a hint now ignored by the orthodox Brahmins -- and forthwith the formerbecome A-Suras. The first and mind-born Sons of the Deity refuse to create progeny, and are cursed by Brahma to beborn as men. They are hurled down to Earth, which, later on, is transformed, in theological dogma, into the infernalregions. Ahriman destroys the Bull created by Ormazd -- which is the emblem of terrestrial illusive life, the \"germ ofsorrow\" -- and, forgetting that the perishing finite seed must die, in order that the plant of immortality, the plant of spiritual,eternal life, should sprout and live, Ahriman is proclaimed the enemy, the opposing power, the devil. Typhon cuts Osirisinto fourteen pieces, in order to prevent his peopling the world and thus creating misery; and Typhon becomes, in theexoteric, theological teaching, the Power of Darkness. But all this is the exoteric shell. It is the worshippers of the latterwho attribute to disobedience and rebellion the effort and self-sacrifice of those who would help men to their originalstatus of divinity through self-conscious efforts; and it is these worshippers of Form who have made demons of theAngels of Light.Esoteric philosophy, however, teaches that one third* of the Dhyanis -- i.e., the three classes of the Arupa Pitris, endowedwith intelligence, \"which is a formless breath, composed of intellectual not elementary substances\" (see Harivamsa, 932)-- was simply doomed by the law of Karma and evolution to be reborn (or incarnated) on Earth.** Some[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"* Whence the subsequent assertions of St. John's vision, referred to in his Apocalypse, about \"the great red Dragonhaving seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads,\" whose \"tail drew the third part of the stars ofheaven and did cast them to the earth\" (ch. xii.).** The verse \"did cast them to the Earth,\" plainly shows its origin in the grandest and oldest allegory of the Aryan mystics,who, after the destruction of the Atlantean [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 94 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of these were Nirmanakayas from other Manvantaras. Hence we see them, in all the Puranas, reappearing on this globe,in the third Manvantara, as Kings, Rishis and heroes (read Third Root-Race). This tenet, being too philosophical andmetaphysical to be grasped by the multitudes, was, as already stated, disfigured by the priesthood for the purpose ofpreserving a hold over them through superstitious fear.The supposed \"rebels,\" then, were simply those who, compelled by Karmic law to drink the cup of gall to its last bitterdrop, had to incarnate anew, and thus make responsible thinking entities of the astral statues projected by their inferiorbrethren. Some are said to have refused, because they had not in them the requisite materials -- i.e., an astral body --since they were arupa. The refusal of others had reference to their having been Adepts and Yogis of long past precedingManvantaras; another mystery. But, later on, as Nirmanakayas, they sacrificed themselves for the good and salvation ofthe Monads which were waiting for their turn, and which otherwise would have had to linger for countless ages inirresponsible, animal-like, though in appearance human, forms. It may be a parable and an allegory within an allegory. Itssolution is left to the intuition of the student, if he only reads that which follows with his spiritual eye.As to their fashioners or \"Ancestors\" -- those Angels who, in the exoteric legends, obeyed the law -- they must beidentical with the Barhishad Pitris, or the Pitar-Devata, i.e., those possessed of the physical creative fire. They could onlycreate, or rather clothe, the human Monads with their own astral Selves, but they could not make man in their image andlikeness. \"Man must not be like one of us,\" say the creative gods, entrusted with the fabrication of the lower animal buthigher; (see Gen. and Plato's Timaeus). Their creating the semblance of men out of their own divine Essence means,esoterically, that it is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] giants and sorcerers, concealed the truth -- astronomical, physical, and divine,as it is a page out of pre-cosmic theogony -- under various allegories. Its esoteric, true interpretation is a veritableTheodice of the \"Fallen Angels,\" so called; the willing and the unwilling, the creators and those who refused to create,being now mixed up most perplexingly by Christian Catholics, who forget that their highest Archangel, St. Michael, who isshown to conquer (to master and to assimilate) the DRAGON OF WISDOM and of divine Self-sacrifice (now miscalledand calumniated as Satan), WAS THE FIRST TO REFUSE TO CREATE! This led to endless confusion. So little doesChristian theology understand the paradoxical language of the East and its symbolism, that it even explains, in its deadletter sense, the Chinese Buddhist and Hindu exoteric rite of raising a noise during certain eclipses to scare away the\"great red Dragon,\" which laid a plot to carry away the light! But here \"Light\" means esoteric Wisdom, and we havesufficiently explained the secret meaning of the terms Dragon, Serpent, etc., etc., all of which refer to Adepts andInitiates.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 95 WHAT PROMETHEUS SYMBOLIZED.they who became the first Race, and thus shared its destiny and further evolution. They would not, simply because theycould not, give to man that sacred spark which burns and expands into the flower of human reason and self-consciousness, for they had it not to give. This was left to that class of Devas who became symbolised in Greece underthe name of Prometheus, to those who had nought to do with the physical body, yet everything with the purely spiritualman. (See Part II of this volume, \"The Fallen Angels\"; also \"The Gods of Light proceed from the Gods of Darkness.\")Each class of Creators endows man with what it has to give: the one builds his external form; the other gives him itsessence, which later on becomes the Human Higher Self owing to the personal exertion of the individual; but they couldnot make men as they were themselves -- perfect, because sinless; sinless, because having only the first, pale shadowyoutlines of attributes, and these all perfect -- from the human standpoint -- white, pure and cold as the virgin snow. Wherethere is no struggle, there is no merit. Humanity, \"of the Earth earthy,\" was not destined to be created by the angels of thefirst divine Breath: therefore they are said to have refused to do so, and man had to be formed by more materialcreators,* who, in their turn, could give only what they had in their own natures, and no more. Subservient to eternal law,the pure gods could only project out of themselves shadowy men, a little less ethereal and spiritual, less divine andperfect than themselves -- shadows still. The first humanity, therefore, was a pale copy of its progenitors; too material,even in its ethereality, to be a hierarchy of gods; too spiritual and pure to be MEN, endowed as it is with every negative(Nirguna) perfection. Perfection, to be fully such, must be born out of imperfection, the incorruptible must grow out of thecorruptible, having the latter as its vehicle and basis and contrast. Absolute light is absolute darkness, and vice versa. Infact, there is neither light nor[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In spite of all efforts to the contrary, Christian theology -- having burdened itself with the Hebrew esoteric account of thecreation of man, which is understood literally -- cannot find any reasonable excuse for its \"God, the Creator,\" whoproduces a man devoid of mind and sense; nor can it justify the punishment following an act, for which Adam and Evemight plead non compos. For if the couple is admitted to be ignorant of good and evil before the eating of the forbiddenfruit, how could it be expected to know that disobedience was evil? If primeval man was meant to remain a half-witted, orrather witless, being, then his creation was aimless and even cruel, if produced by an omnipotent and perfect God. ButAdam and Eve are shown, even in Genesis, to be created by a class of lower divine Beings, the Elohim, who are sojealous of their personal prerogatives as reasonable and intelligent creatures, that they will not allow man to become \"as"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"one of us.\" This is plain, even from the dead-letter meaning of the Bible. The Gnostics, then, were right in regarding theJewish God as belonging to a class of lower, material and not very holy denizens of the invisible World.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 96 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.darkness in the realms of truth. Good and Evil are twins, the progeny of Space and Time, under the sway of Maya.Separate them, by cutting off one from the other, and they will both die. Neither exists per se, since each has to begenerated and created out of the other, in order to come into being; both must be known and appreciated beforebecoming objects of perception, hence, in mortal mind, they must be divided.Nevertheless, as the illusionary distinction exists, it requires a lower order of creative angels to \"create\" inhabited globes -- especially ours -- or to deal with matter on this earthly plane. The philosophical Gnostics were the first to think so, in thehistorical period, and to invent various systems upon this theory. Therefore in their schemes of creation, one always findstheir Creators occupying a place at the very foot of the ladder of spiritual Being. With them, those who created our earthand its mortals were placed on the very limit of mayavic matter, and their followers were taught to think -- to the greatdisgust of the Church Fathers -- that for the creation of those wretched races, in a spiritual and moral sense, which graceour globe, no high divinity could be made responsible, but only angels of a low hierarchy,* to which class they relegatedthe Jewish God, Jehovah.Mankinds different from the present are mentioned in all the ancient Cosmogonies. Plato speaks, in the Phaedrus, of awinged race of men. Aristophanes (in Plato's Banquet), speaks of a race androgynous and with round bodies. InPymander, all the animal kingdom even is double-sexed. Thus in § 18, it is said: \"The circuit having been accomplished,the knot was loosened. . . . and all the animals, which were equally androgynous, were untied (separated) together withman. . . . .\" for. . . . \"the causes had to produce effects on earth.\"** Again, in the ancient Quiche Manuscript, the PopolVuh -- published by the late Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg -- the first men are described as a race \"whose sight wasunlimited, and who knew all things at once\": thus showing the divine knowledge of Gods, not mortals. The SecretDoctrine, correcting the unavoidable exaggerations of popular fancy, gives the facts as they are recorded in the Archaicsymbols.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In Isis Unveiled several of these Gnostic systems are given. One is taken from the Codex Nazaraeus, the Scriptures ofthe Nazarenes, who, although they existed long before the days of Christ, and even before the laws of Moses, wereGnostics, and many of them Initiates. They held their \"Mysteries of Life\" in Nazara (ancient and modern Nazareth), andtheir doctrines are a faithful echo of the teachings of the Secret Doctrine -- some of which we are now endeavouring toexplain.** See the translation from the Greek by Francois, Monsieur de Foix, Evesque d'Ayre: the work dedicated to Margueritede France, Reine de Navarre. Edition of 1579, Bordeaux.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 97 THE TREES OF LIFE.(b) These \"shadows\" were born \"each of his own colour and kind,\" each also \"inferior to his creator,\" because the latterwas a complete being of his kind. The Commentaries refer the first sentence to the colour or complexion of each humanrace thus evolved. In Pymander, the Seven primitive men, created by Nature from the \"heavenly Man,\" all partake of thequalities of the \"Seven Governors,\" or Rulers, who loved Man -- their own reflection and synthesis.In the Norse Legends, one recognizes in Asgard, the habitat of the gods, as also in the Ases themselves, the samemystical loci and personifications woven into the popular \"myths,\" as in our Secret Doctrine; and we find them in theVedas, the Puranas, the Mazdean Scriptures and the Kabala. The Ases of Scandinavia, the rulers of the world whichpreceded ours, whose name means literally the \"pillars of the world,\" its \"supports,\" are thus identical with the GreekCosmocratores, the \"Seven Workmen or Rectors\" of Pymander, the seven Rishis and Pitris of India, the seven Chaldeangods and seven evil spirits, the seven Kabalistic Sephiroth synthesised by the upper triad, and even the seven PlanetarySpirits of the Christian mystics. The Ases create the earth, the seas, the sky and the clouds, the whole visible world, fromthe remains of the slain giant Ymir; but they do not create MAN, but only his form from the Ask or ash-tree. It is Odin whoendows him with life and soul, after Lodur had given him blood and bones, and finally it is Honir who furnishes him withhis intellect (manas) and with his conscious senses. The Norse Ask, the Hesiodic Ash-tree, whence issued the men of thegeneration of bronze, the Third Root-Race, and the Tzite tree of the Popol-Vuh, out of which the Mexican third race ofmen was created, are all one.* This may be plainly seen by any reader. But the Occult reason why the Norse Yggdrasil,the Hindu Aswatha, the Gogard, the Hellenic tree of life, and the Tibetan Zampun, are one with the Kabalistic SephirothalTree, and even with the Holy Tree made by Ahura Mazda, and the Tree of Eden -- who among the western scholars cantell?** Nevertheless, the fruits of all those \"Trees,\" whether Pippala or Haoma or yet the more prosaic apple, are the\"plants of life,\" in fact and verity. The prototypes of our races were all enclosed in the microcosmic tree, which grew anddeveloped within and under the great mundane macrocosmic tree***; and the mystery is half revealed in theDirghotamas, where it is said: \"Pippala, the sweet fruit of that tree upon which come spirits who[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Max Muller's review of the Popol-Vuh.** Mr. James Darmesteter, the translator of the Vendidad, speaking of it, says: \"The tree, whatever it is . . .\" (p. 209).*** Plato's \"Timaeus.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 98 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"love the science, and where the gods produce all marvels.\" As in the Gogard, among the luxuriant branches of all thosemundane trees, the \"Serpent\" dwells. But while the Macroscosmic tree is the Serpent of Eternity and of absolute Wisdomitself, those who dwell in the Microcosmic tree are the Serpents of the manifested Wisdom. One is the One and All; theothers are its reflected parts. The \"tree\" is man himself, of course, and the Serpents dwelling in each, the consciousManas, the connecting link between Spirit and Matter, heaven and earth.Everywhere, it is the same. The creating powers produce Man, but fail in their final object. All these logoi strive to endowman with conscious immortal spirit, reflected in the Mind (manas) alone; they fail, and they are all represented as beingpunished for the failure, if not for the attempt. What is the nature of the punishment? A sentence of imprisonment in thelower or nether region, which is our earth; the lowest in its chain; an \"eternity\" -- meaning the duration of the life-cycle -- inthe darkness of matter, or within animal Man. It has pleased the half ignorant and half designing Church Fathers todisfigure the graphic symbol. They took advantage of the metaphor and allegory found in every old religion to turn them tothe benefit of the new one. Thus man was transformed into the darkness of a material hell; his divine consciousness,obtained from his indwelling Principle (the Manasa), or the incarnated Deva, became the glaring flames of the infernalregion; and our globe that Hell itself. Pippala, Haoma, the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, were denounced as theforbidden fruit, and the \"Serpent of Wisdom,\" the Voice of reason and consciousness, remained identified for ages withthe Fallen Angel, which is the old Dragon, the Devil! (Vide Part II., \"The Evil Spirit, who, or what?\")The same for the other high symbols. The Svastica, the most sacred and mystic symbol in India, the \"Jaina-Cross\" as it isnow called by the Masons, notwithstanding its direct connection, and even identity with the Christian Cross, has becomedishonoured in the same manner. It is the \"devil's sign,\" we are told by the Indian missionaries. \"Does it not shine on thehead of the great Serpent of Vishnu, on the thousand headed Sesha-Ananta, in the depths of Patala, the Hindu Naraka orHell\"? It does: but what is Ananta? As Sesha, it is the almost endless Manvantaric cycle of time, and becomes infiniteTime itself, when called Ananta, the great seven-headed Serpent, on which rests Vishnu, the eternal Deity, duringPralayic inactivity. What has Satan to do with this highly metaphysical symbol? The Svastica is the most philosophicallyscientific of all symbols, as also the most comprehensible. It is the summary in a few lines of the whole work of creation,or evolution, as one should rather say, from Cosmo-theogony down to Anthro-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 99 THE HAMMER OF THOR.pogony, from the indivisible unknown Parabrahm to the humble moneron of materialistic science, whose genesis is asunknown to that science as is that of the All-Deity itself. The Svastica is found heading the religious symbols of every oldnation. It is the \"Worker's Hammer\" in the Chaldean Book of Numbers, the \"Hammer\" just referred to in the \"Book ofConcealed Mystery\" (Ch. I., §§ 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.), \"which striketh sparks from the flint\" (Space), those sparks becomingworlds. It is \"Thor's Hammer,\" the magic weapon forged by the dwarfs against the Giants, or the pre-cosmic Titanic forcesof Nature, which rebel and, while alive in the region of matter, will not be subdued by the Gods, the Agents of UniversalHarmony, but have first to be destroyed. This is why the world is formed out of the relics of the murdered Ymir. TheSvastica is the Miolnir, the \"storm-hammer\"; and therefore it is said that when the Ases, the holy gods, after having beenpurified by fire (the fire of passions and suffering in their life-incarnations), become fit to dwell in Ida in eternal peace, thenMiolnir will become useless. This will be when the bonds of Hel (the goddess-queen of the region of the Dead) will bindthem no longer, for the kingdom of evil will have passed away. \"Surtur's flames had not destroyed them, nor yet had theraging waters\" of the several deluges. . . . . \"Then came the sons of Thor. They brought Miolnir with them, no longer as aweapon of war, but as the hammer with which to consecrate the new heaven and the new Earth. . . . . \"*Verily many are its meanings! In the Macrocosmic work, the \"HAMMER OF CREATION,\" with its four arms bent at rightangles, refers to the continual motion and revolution of the invisible Kosmos of Forces. In that of the manifested Kosmosand our Earth, it points to the rotation in the cycles of Time of the world's axes and their equatorial belts; the two linesforming the Svastica [[diagram]] meaning Spirit and Matter, the four hooks suggesting the motion in the revolving cycles.Applied to the Microcosm, Man, it shows him to be a link between heaven and Earth: the right hand being raised at theend of a horizontal arm, the left pointing to the Earth. In the Smaragdine Tablet of Hermes, the uplifted right hand isinscribed with the word \"Solve,\" the left with the word \"Coagula.\" It is at one and the same time an Alchemical,Cosmogonical, Anthropological, and Magical sign, with seven keys to its inner meaning. It is not too much to say that thecompound symbolism of this universal and most suggestive of signs contains the key to the seven great mysteries ofKosmos. Born in the mystical conceptions of the early Aryans, and by them placed at the very threshold of eternity, on thehead of the serpent Ananta, it found[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Asgard and the Gods\": \"The renewal of the World.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 100 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.its spiritual death in the scholastic interpretations of mediaeval Anthropomorphists. It is the Alpha and the Omega ofuniversal creative Force, evolving from pure Spirit and ending in gross Matter. It is also the key to the cycle of Science,divine and human; and he who comprehends its full meaning is for ever liberated from the toils of Mahamaya, the greatIllusion and Deceiver. The light that shines from under the divine hammer, now degraded into the mallet or gavel of theGrand Masters of Masonic Lodges, is sufficient to dissipate the darkness of any human schemes or fictions.How prophetic are the songs of the three Norse Goddesses, to whom the ravens of Odin whisper of the past and thefuture, as they flutter around in their abode of crystal beneath the flowing river. The songs are all written down in the\"Scrolls of Wisdom,\" of which many are lost but some still remain: and they repeat in poetical allegory the teachings of thearchaic ages. To summarise from Dr. Wagner's \"Asgard and the Gods,\" the \"renewal of the world,\" which is a prophecyabout the seventh Race of our Round told in the past tense.The Miolnir had done its duty in this Round, and:--"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"\". . . . on the field of Ida, the field of resurrection (for the Fifth Round), the sons of the highest gods assembled, and inthem their fathers rose again (the Egos of all their past incarnations). They talked of the Past and the Present, andremembered the wisdom and prophecies of their ancestor which had all been fulfilled. Near them, but unseen of them,was the strong, the mighty One, who rules all things. . . . and ordains the eternal laws that govern the world. They allknew he was there, they felt his presence and his power, but were ignorant of his name. At his command the new Earthrose out of the Waters of Space. To the South above the Field of Ida, he made another heaven called Audlang, andfurther off, a third, Widblain.

From Gimil's heights (the seventh planet or globe, the highest and the purest), they looked down upon thehappy descendants of LIF and LIFTHRASIR (the coming Adam and Eve of purified humanity), and signed to them toCLIMB up higher, to rise in knowledge and wisdom, step by step, from one \"heaven to another,\" until they were at last fitto be united to the Gods in the house of All-Father (p. 305).He who knows the doctrines of Esoteric Budhism, (or Wisdom), though so imperfectly sketched hitherto, will see clearlythe allegory contained in the above.Its more philosophical meaning will be better understood if the reader thinks carefully over the myth of Prometheus.

Degraded into a purely physiological symbol by some Orientalists, andtaken in connection with terrestrial fire only, their interpretation is an insult to every religion, including Christianity, whosegreatest mystery is thus dragged down to matter. The \"friction\" of divine Pramantha and Arani could suggest itself underthis image only to the brutal conceptions of the German materialists -- than whom there are none worse. It is true that theDivine babe, Agni with the Sanskrit-speaking Race, who became Ignis with the Latins, is born from the conjunction ofPramantha and Arani (Svastica) during the sacrificial ceremony. But what of that? Twashtri (Viswakarman) is the \"divineartist and carpenter\"* and is also the Father of the gods and of creative fire in the Vedas. So ancient is the symbol and sosacred, that there is hardly an excavation made on the sites of old cities without its being found. A number of such terracotta discs, called fusaiolos, were found by Dr. Schliemann under the ruins of ancient Troy. Both these forms [[diagram]]and [[diagram]] were excavated in great abundance, their presence being one more proof that the ancient Trojans andtheir ancestors were pure Aryans.(c) Chhaya, as already explained, is the astral image. It bears this meaning in Sanskrit works. Thus Sanjna (SpiritualConsciousness), the wife of Surya, the Sun, is shown retiring into the jungle to lead an ascetic life, and leaving behind toher husband her Chhaya, shadow or image.-------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The \"Father of the Sacred Fire,\" writes Prof. Jolly, \"is Twashtri . . . his mother was Maya. He himself was styled Akta(anointed, [[christos]]), after the priest had poured upon his head the spirituous (?) SOMA, and on his body butter purifiedby sacrifice\"; (\"Man before Metals,\" p. 190). The source of his information is not given by the French Darwinist. But thelines are quoted to show that light begins to dawn even upon the materialists. Adalbert Kuhn, in his \"Die Herabkunft desFeuers,\" identifies the two signs [[diagram]] and [[diagram]] with Arani, and designates them under this name. He adds:\"This process of kindling fire naturally led men to the idea of sexual reproduction,\" etc. Why could not a more dignifiedidea, and one more occult, have led man to invent that symbol, in so far as it is connected, in one of its aspects, withhuman reproduction? But its chief symbolism refers to Cosmogony.\"Agni, in the condition of Akta, or anointed, is suggestive of Christ,\" remarks Prof. Jolly. \"Maya, Mary, his mother; Twastri,St. Joseph, the carpenter of the Bible.\" In the Rig Veda, Viswakarman is the highest and oldest of the Gods and their\"Father.\" He is the \"carpenter or builder,\" because God is called even by the monotheists, \"the Architect of the Universe.\"Still, the original idea is purely metaphysical, and had no connection with the later Phallicism.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 102 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.16. HOW ARE THE (real) MANUSHYAS BORN? THE MANUS WITH MINDS, HOW ARE THEY MADE? (a) THEFATHERS (Barhishad (?)) CALL TO THEIR HELP THEIR OWN FIRE (the Kavyavahana, electric fire), WHICH IS THEFIRE WHICH BURNS IN EARTH. THE SPIRIT OF THE EARTH CALLED TO HIS HELP THE SOLAR FIRE (Suchi, thespirit in the Sun). THESE THREE (the Pitris and the two fires) PRODUCED IN THEIR JOINT EFFORTS A GOOD RUPA.IT (the form) COULD STAND, WALK, RUN, RECLINE AND FLY. YET IT WAS STILL BUT A CHHAYA, A SHADOWWITH NO SENSE (b) . . . . . .(a) Here an explanation again becomes necessary in the light, and with the help of the exoteric added to the esotericscriptures. The \"Manushyas\" (men) and the Manus are here equivalent to the Chaldean \"Adam\" -- this term not meaningat all the first man, as with the Jews, or one solitary individual, but mankind collectively, as with the Chaldeans andAssyrians. It is the four orders or classes of Dhyan Chohans out of the seven, says the Commentary, \"who were theprogenitors of the concealed man,\" i.e., the subtle inner man. The \"Lha\" of the Moon, the lunar spirits, were, as alreadystated, only the ancestors of his form, i.e., of the model according to which Nature began her external work upon him.Thus primitive man was, when he appeared, only a senseless Bhuta* or a \"Phantom.\" This \"creation\" was a failure, thereason of which will be explained in the Commentary on Sloka 20.(b) This attempt was again a failure. It allegorizes the vanity of physical nature's unaided attempts to construct even aperfect animal -- let alone man. For the \"Fathers,\" the lower Angels, are all Nature-Spirits and the higher Elementals also"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"possess an intelligence of their own; but this is not enough to construct a THINKING man. \"Living Fire\" was needed, thatfire which gives the human mind its self-perception and self-consciousness, or Manas; and the progeny of Parvaka andSuchi are the animal electric and solar fires, which create animals, and could thus furnish but a physical living constitutionto that first astral model of man. The first creators, then, were the Pygmalions of primeval man: they failed to animate thestatue -- intellectually.This Stanza we shall see is very suggestive.

In the VishnuPurana, Book I, ch. 5, the Sloka simply says: \"Bhutas -- fiends, frightful from being monkey-coloured and carnivorous\";and the word in India now means ghosts, ethereal or astral phantoms, while in esoteric teaching it means elementarysubstances, something made of attenuated, noncompound essence, and, specifically, the astral double of any man oranimal. In this case these primitive men are the doubles of the first ethereal Dhyanis or Pitris.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 103 THE DIVINE REBELS.HIGHER SELF or human Monad -- and the animal Monad, both one and the same, although the former is endowed withdivine intelligence, the latter with instinctual faculty alone. How is the difference to be explained, and the presence of thatHIGHER SELF in man accounted for?\"The Sons of MAHAT are the quickeners of the human Plant. They are the Waters falling upon the arid soil of latent life,and the Spark that vivifies the human animal. They are the Lords of Spiritual Life eternal.\" . . . . \"In the beginning (in theSecond Race) some (of the Lords) only breathed of their essence into Manushya (men); and some took in man theirabode.\"This shows that not all men became incarnations of the \"divine Rebels,\" but only a few among them. The remainder hadtheir fifth principle simply quickened by the spark thrown into it, which accounts for the great difference between theintellectual capacities of men and races. Had not the \"sons of Mahat,\" speaking allegorically, skipped the intermediateworlds, in their impulse toward intellectual freedom, the animal man would never have been able to reach upward fromthis earth, and attain through self-exertion his ultimate goal. The cyclic pilgrimage would have to be performed through allthe planes of existence half unconsciously, if not entirely so, as in the case of the animals. It is owing to this rebellion ofintellectual life against the morbid inactivity of pure spirit, that we are what we are -- self-conscious, thinking men, with thecapabilities and attributes of Gods in us, for good as much as for evil. Hence the REBELS are our saviours. Let thephilosopher ponder well over this, and more than one mystery will become clear to him. It is only by the attractive force ofthe contrasts that the two opposites -- Spirit and Matter -- can be cemented on Earth, and, smelted in the fire of self-conscious experience and suffering, find themselves wedded in Eternity. This will reveal the meaning of many hithertoincomprehensible allegories, foolishly called \"fables.\" (Vide infra, \"The Secret of Satan.\")It explains, to begin with, the statement made in Pymander: that the \"heavenly MAN,\" the \"Son of the Father,\" whopartook of the nature and essence of the Seven Governors, or creators and Rulers of the material world, \"peeped throughthe Harmony and, breaking through the Seven Circles of Fire, made manifest the downward-born nature.\"* It explainsevery verse in that Hermetic narrative, as also the Greek allegory of Prometheus. Most important of all, it explains themany allegorical accounts about the \"Wars in Heaven,\" including that of Revelation with respect to the Christian dogma ofthe fallen angels.

It even solves the recent perplexity of the Assyriologists, who express their wonder through the lateGeorge Smith.\"My first idea of this part\" (of the rebellion), he says, \"was that the wars with the powers of Evil preceded the Creation; Inow think it followed the account of the fall\" (Chaldean Account of Genesis, p. 92). In this work Mr. George Smith givesan engraving, from an early Babylonian cylinder, of the Sacred Tree, the Serpent, man and woman. The tree has sevenbranches: three on the man's side, four on that of the female. These branches are typical of the seven Root-Races, in thethird of which, at its very close, occurred the separation of the sexes and the so-called FALL into generation. The threeearliest Races were sexless, then hermaphrodite; the other four, male and female, as distinct from each other. \"TheDragon,\" says Mr. G. Smith, \"which in the Chaldean account of the creation leads man to sin, is the creation of Tiamat,the living principle of the Sea, or Chaos . . . which was opposed to the deities at the creation of the world.\" This is anerror. The Dragon is the male principle, or Phallus, personified, or rather animalized; and Tiamat, \"the embodiment of theSpirit of Chaos,\" of the deep, or Abyss, is the female principle, the Womb. The \"Spirit of Chaos and Disorder\" refers to themental perturbation which it led to. It is the sensual, attractive, magnetic principle which fascinates and seduces, the everliving active element which throws the whole world into disorder, chaos, and sin. The Serpent seduces the woman, but itis the latter who seduces man, and both are included in the Karmic curse, though only as a natural result of a causeproduced. Says George Smith: \"It is clear that the Dragon is included in the curse for the Fall, and that the Gods\" (theElohim, jealous at seeing the man of clay becoming a Creator in his turn, like all the animals,) \"invoke on the head of thehuman Race all the evils which afflict humanity. Wisdom and knowledge shall injure him, he shall have family quarrels, hewill anger the gods, he shall submit to tyranny. . . . he shall be disappointed in his desires, he shall pour out uselessprayers, he shall commit future sin. .

(Vide paragraph (a)), a few remarks will now suffice. The \"Father\" of primitivephysical man, or of his body, is the vital electric principle residing in the Sun. The Moon is its Mother, because of thatmysterious power in the Moon which has as decided an influence upon human gestation and generation, which itregulates, as it has on the growth of plants and animals. The \"Wind\" or Ether, standing in this case for the agent oftransmission by which those influences are carried down from the two luminaries and diffused upon Earth, is referred toas the \"nurse\"; while \"Spiritual Fire\" alone makes of man a divine and perfect entity.Now what is that \"Spiritual Fire\"? In alchemy it is HYDROGEN, in general; while in esoteric actuality it is the emanation orthe Ray which proceeds from its noumenon, the \"Dhyan of the first Element.\" Hydrogen is gas only on our terrestrialplane. But even in chemistry hydrogen \"would be the only existing form of matter, in our sense of the term,\"* and is verynearly allied to protyle, which is our layam. It is the father and generator, so to say, or rather the Upadhi (basis), of bothAIR and WATER, and is \"fire, air and water,\" in fact: one under three aspects; hence the chemical and alchemical trinity.In the world of manifestation or matter it is the objective symbol and the material emanation from the subjective andpurely spiritual entitative Being in the region of noumena. Well might Godfrey Higgins have compared Hydrogen to, andeven identified it with, the To ON, the \"One\" of the Greeks. For, as he remarks, Hydrogen is not Water, though itgenerates it; Hydrogen is not fire, though it manifests or creates it; nor is it Air, though air may be regarded as a productof the union of Water and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Genesis of the Elements,\" by Prof. W. Crookes, p. 21.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 106 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Fire -- since Hydrogen is found in the aqueous element of the atmosphere. It is three in one.If one studies comparative Theogony, it is easy to find that the secret of these \"Fires\" was taught in the Mysteries of everyancient people, pre-eminently in Samothrace. There is not the smallest doubt that the Kabeiri, the most arcane of all theancient deities, gods and men, great deities and Titans, are identical with the Kumaras and Rudras headed by Kartikeya -- a Kumara also. This is quite evident even exoterically; and these Hindu deities were, like the Kabeiri, the personifiedsacred Fires of the most occult powers of Nature. The several branches of the Aryan Race, the Asiatic and the European,the Hindu and the Greek, did their best to conceal their true nature, if not their importance. As in the case of the Kumaras,the number of the Kabeiri is uncertain. Some say that there were three or four only; others say seven. Aschieros,Achiosersa, Achiochersus, and Camillus may very well stand for the alter egos of the four Kumaras -- Sanat-Kumara,Sananda, Sanaka, and Sanatana. The former deities, whose reputed father was Vulcan, were often confounded with theDioscuri, Corybantes, Anaces, etc.; just as the Kumara, whose reputed father is Brahma, (or rather, the \"Flame of hisWrath,\" which prompted him to perform the ninth or Kumara creation, resulting in Rudra or Nilalohita (Siva) and theKumaras), were confounded with the Asuras, the Rudras, and the Pitris, for the simple reason that they are all one -- i.e.,correlative Forces and Fires. There is no space to describe these \"fires\" and their real meaning here, though we mayattempt to do so if the third and fourth volumes of this work are ever published. Meanwhile a few more explanations maybe added.The foregoing are all mysteries which must be left to the personal intuition of the student for solution, rather thandescribed. If he would learn something of the secret of the FIRES, let him turn to certain works of the Alchemists, whovery correctly connect fire with every element, as do the Occultists. The reader must remember that the ancientsconsidered religion, and the natural sciences along with philosophy, to be closely and inseparably linked together.AEsculapius was the Son of Apollo -- the Sun or FIRE of Life; at once Helios, Pythios, and the god of oracular Wisdom. Inexoteric religions, as much as in esoteric philosophy, the Elements -- especially fire, water, and air -- are made theprogenitors of our five physical senses, and hence are directly connected (in an occult way) with them. These physicalsenses pertain even to a lower creation than the one called in the Puranas Pratisarga, or secondary Creation. \"Liquid fireproceeds from indiscrete fire,\" says an Occult axiom.\"The Circle is the THOUGHT; the diameter (or the line) is the WORD;------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 2, Page]] 107 BATH-KOL, DAUGHTER OF THE VOICE.and their union is LIFE.\" In the Kabala, Bath-Kol is the daughter of the Divine Voice, or primordial light, Shekinah. In thePuranas and Hindu exotericism, Vach (the Voice) is the female Logos of Brahma -- a permutation of Aditi, primordial light.And if Bath-Kol, in Jewish mysticism, is an articulate praeternatural voice from heaven, revealing to the \"chosen people\"the sacred traditions and laws, it is only because Vach was called, before Judaism, the \"Mother of the Vedas,\" whoentered into the Rishis and inspired them by her revelations; just as Bath-Kol is said to have inspired the prophets ofIsrael and the Jewish High-Priests. And both exist to this day, in their respective sacred symbologies, because theancients associated sound or Speech with the Ether of Space, of which Sound is the characteristic. Hence Fire, Waterand Air are the primordial Cosmic Trinity. \"I am thy Thought, thy God, more ancient than the moist principle, the light thatradiates within Darkness (Chaos), and the shining Word of God (Sound) is the Son of the Deity.\" (\"Pymander,\" § 6.)*Thus we have to study well the \"Primary creation,\" before we can understand the Secondary. The first Race had threerudimentary elements in it; and no fire as yet; because, with the Ancients, the evolution of man, and the growth anddevelopment of his spiritual and physical senses, were subordinate to the evolution of the elements on the Cosmic planeof this Earth. All proceeds from Prabhavapyaya, the evolution of the creative and sentient principles in the gods, and evenof the so-called creative deity himself. This is found in the names and appellations given to Vishnu in exoteric scriptures.As the Protologos (the Orphic), he is called Purvaja, \"pregenetic,\" and then the other names connect him in theirdescending order more and more with matter.The following order on parallel lines may be found in the evolution of the Elements and the Senses; or in Cosmicterrestrial \"MAN\" or \"Spirit,\" and mortal physical man:--1. Ether ... Hearing ... Sound.2. Air ... Touch ... Sound and Touch.3. Fire, or Light ... Sight ... Sound, Touch and Colour.4. Water ... Taste ... Sound, Touch, Colour and Taste.5. Earth ... Smell ... Sound, Touch, Colour, Taste and Smell.As seen, each Element adds to its own characteristics, those of its[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The opponents of Hinduism may call the above Pantheism, Polytheism, or anything they may please. If Science is notentirely blinded by prejudice, it will see in this account a profound knowledge of natural Sciences and Physics, as well asof Metaphysics and Psychology. But to find this out, one has to study the personifications, and then convert them intochemical atoms. It will then be found to satisfy both physical and even purely materialistic Science, as well as those whosee in evolution the work of the \"Great Unknown Cause\" in its phenomenal and illusive aspects.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 108 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.predecessor; as each Root-Race adds the characterizing sense of the preceding Race. The same is true in the septenarycreation of man, who evolves gradually in seven stages, and on the same principles, as will be shown further on.Thus, while Gods or Dhyan Chohans (Devas) proceed from the First Cause -- which is not Parabrahm, for the latter is theALL CAUSE, and cannot be referred to as the \"First Cause,\" -- which First Cause is called in the Brahmanical BooksJagad-Yoni, \"the womb of the world,\" mankind emanates from these active agents in Kosmos. But men, during the firstand the second races, were not physical beings, but merely rudiments of the future men: Bhutas, which proceeded fromBhutadi, \"origin,\" or the \"original place whence sprung the Elements.\" Hence they proceeded with all the rest fromPrabhavapyaya, \"the place whence is the origination, and into which is the resolution of all things,\" as explained by theCommentator. Whence also our physical senses. Whence even the highest \"created\" deity itself, in our philosophy. Asone with the Universe, whether we call him Brahma, Iswara, or Purusha, he is a manifested deity, -- hence created, orlimited and conditioned. This is easily proven, even from the exoteric teachings.After being called the incognizable, eternal Brahma (neuter or abstract), the Punda-Rikaksha, \"supreme and imperishableglory,\" once that instead of Sadaika-Rupa, \"changeless\" or \"immutable\" Nature, he is addressed as Ekanaka-Rupa, \"bothsingle and manifold,\" he, the cause, becomes merged with his own effects; and his names, if placed in esoteric order,show the following descending scale:--1. Mahapurusha or Paramatman ........ Supreme Spirit.2. Atman or Purvaja (Protologos) .... The living Spirit of Nature.3. Indriyatman, or Hrishikesa ....... Spiritual or intellectual soul (One with the senses).5. Bhutatman ........................ The living, or Life Soul.6. Kshetrajna ....................... Embodied soul, or the Universe of Spirit and Matter.7. Bhrantidarsanatah ................ False perception -- Material Universe.The last name means something perceived or conceived of, owing to false and erroneous apprehension, as a materialform; but, in fact, only Maya, illusion, as all is in our physical universe.It is in strict analogy with ITS attributes in both the spiritual and material worlds, that the evolution of the Dhyan ChohanicEssences takes place; the characteristics of the latter being reflected, in their turn, in Man, collectively, and in each of hisprinciples; every one of which contains in itself, in the same progressive order, a portion of their various \"fires\" andelements.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 109 THE TABULA SMARAGDINA."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"STANZA V.THE EVOLUTION OF THE SECOND RACE.-------§§ (18) The Sons of Yoga.

THE FIRST (Race) WERE THE SONS OF YOGA. THEIR SONS, THE CHILDREN OF THE YELLOW FATHER ANDTHE WHITE MOTHER.In the later Commentary, the sentence is translated:--\"The Sons of the Sun and of the Moon, the nursling of ether (or the wind ) (a) . . . . . . .\"They were the shadows of the shadows of the Lords (b). They (the shadows) expanded. The Spirits of the Earth clothedthem; the solar Lhas warmed them (i.e. preserved the vital fire in the nascent physical forms). The Breaths had life, buthad no understanding. They had no fire nor water of their own (c).(a) Remember in this connection the Tabula Smaragdina of Hermes, the esoteric meaning of which has seven keys to it.The Astro-Chemical is well known to students, the anthropological may be given now. The \"One thing\" mentioned in it isMAN. It is said: \"The Father of THAT ONE ONLY THING is the Sun; its Mother the Moon; the Wind carries it in hisbosom, and its nurse is the Spirituous Earth.\" In the occult rendering of the same it is added: \"and Spiritual Fire is itsinstructor (Guru).\"This fire is the higher Self, the Spiritual Ego, or that which is eternally reincarnating under the influence of its lowerpersonal Selves, changing with every re-birth, full of Tanha or desire to live. It is a strange law of Nature that, on thisplane, the higher (Spiritual) Nature should be, so to say, in bondage to the lower. Unless the Ego takes refuge in theAtman, the ALL-SPIRIT, and merges entirely into the essence thereof, the personal Ego may goad it to the bitter end.This cannot be thoroughly understood unless the student makes himself familiar with the mystery of evolution, whichproceeds on triple lines -- spiritual, psychic and physical.That which propels towards, and forces evolution, i.e., compels the growth and development of Man towards perfection, is(a) the MONAD,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 110 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.or that which acts in it unconsciously through a force inherent in itself; and (b) the lower astral body or the personal SELF.The former, whether imprisoned in a vegetable or an animal body, is endowed with, is indeed itself, that force. Owing toits identity with the ALL-FORCE, which, as said, is inherent in the Monad, it is all-potent on the Arupa, or formless plane.On our plane, its essence being too pure, it remains all-potential, but individually becomes inactive: e.g., the rays of theSun, which contribute to the growth of vegetation, do not select this or that plant to shine upon. Uproot the plant andtransfer it to a piece of soil where the sunbeam cannot reach it, and the latter will not follow it. So with the Atman: unlessthe higher Self or EGO gravitates towards its Sun the Monad -- the lower Ego, or personal Self, will have the upper handin every case. For it is this Ego, with its fierce Selfishness and animal desire to live a Senseless life (Tanha), which is \"themaker of the tabernacle,\" as Buddha calls it in Dhammapada (153 and 154). Hence the expression, \"the Spirits of theEarth clothed the shadows and expanded them.\" To these \"Spirits\" belong temporarily the human astral selves; and it isthey who give, or build, the physical tabernacle of man, for the Monad and its conscious principle, Manas, to dwell in. Butthe \"Solar\" Lhas, Spirits, warm them, the shadows. This is physically and literally true; metaphysically, or on the psychicand spiritual plane, it is equally true that the Atman alone warms the inner man; i.e., it enlightens it with the ray of divinelife and alone is able to impart to the inner man, or the reincarnating Ego, its immortality. Thus, as we shall find, for thefirst three and a half Root-Races, up to the middle or turning point, it is the astral shadows of the \"progenitors,\" the lunarPitris, which are the formative powers in the Races, and which build and gradually force the evolution of the physical formtowards perfection -- this, at the cost of a proportionate loss of spirituality. Then, from the turning point, it is the HigherEgo, or incarnating principle, the nous or Mind, which reigns over the animal Ego, and rules it whenever it is not carrieddown by the latter. In short, Spirituality is on its ascending arc, and the animal or physical impedes it from steadilyprogressing on the path of its evolution only when the selfishness of the personality has so strongly infected the real innerman with its lethal virus, that the upward attraction has lost all its power on the thinking reasonable man. In sober truth,vice and wickedness are an abnormal, unnatural manifestation, at this period of our human evolution -- at least theyought to be so. The fact that mankind was never more selfish and vicious than it is now, civilized nations havingsucceeded in making of the first an ethical characteristic, of the second an art, is an additional proof of the exceptionalnature of the phenomenon.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 111 THE SHELLS OF SHEBA HACHALOTH.The entire scheme is in the \"Chaldean Book of Numbers,\" and even in the Zohar, if one only understood the meaning ofthe apocalyptic hints. First comes En-Soph, the \"Concealed of the Concealed,\" then the Point, Sephira and the laterSephiroth; then the Atzilatic World, a World of Emanations that gives birth to three other worlds -- called the Throne, theabode of pure Spirits; the second, the World of Formation, or Jetzira, the habitat of the Angels who sent forth the Third, orWorld of Action, the Asiatic World, which is the Earth or our World; and yet it is said of it that this world, also calledKliphoth, containing the (six other) Spheres, [[hebrew]], and matter, is the residence of the \"Prince of Darkness.\" This isas clearly stated as can be; for Metatron, the Angel of the second or Briatic World, means Messenger [[angelos]], Angel,called the great Teacher; and under him are the Angels of the third World, Jetzira, whose ten and seven classes are theSephiroth,* of whom it is said that \"they inhabit and vivify this world as Essential Entities and Intelligences, whose"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"correlatives and contraries inhabit the third or Asiatic World.\" These \"Contraries\" are called \"the Shells,\" [[hebrew]], ordemons,** who inhabit the seven habitations called Sheba Hachaloth, which are simply the seven zones of our globe.Their prince is called in the Kabala Samael, the Angel of Death, who is also the seducing serpent Satan; but that Satan isalso Lucifer, the bright angel of Light, the Light and Life-bringer, the \"Soul\" alienated from the Holy Ones, the otherangels, and for a period, anticipating the time when they would have descended on Earth to incarnate in their turn.\"The Souls (Monads) are pre-existent in the world of Emanations,\" (Book of Wisdom viii., 20); and the Zohar teaches thatin the \"Soul\" \"is the real man, i.e., the Ego and the conscious I AM: 'Manas.' \"\"They descend from the pure air to be chained to bodies,\" says Josephus repeating the belief of the Essenes (De BelloJudaeo, 11, 12). \"The air is full of Souls,\" states Philo, \"they descend to be tied to mortal bodies, being desirous to live inthem.\" (De Gignat, 222 c.; De Somniis, p. 455)***; because through, and in, the human form they will become progressivebeings, whereas the nature of the angel is purely intransitive, therefore man has in him the potency of transcending thefaculties of the Angels. Hence the Initiates in India say that it is the Brahmin, the twice-born, who rules the gods or devas;and Paul repeated it in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Vol. I.

His protoplastic body was not formed of that matter of which our mortalframes are fashioned. \"When Adam dwelt in the garden of Eden, he was clothed in the celestial garment, which is thegarment of heavenly light. . . . light of that light which was used in the garden of Eden,\" (Zohar II 229 B). \"Man (theheavenly Adam) was created by the ten Sephiroth of the Jetziric world, and by the common power they (the seven angelsof a still lower world) engendered the earthly Adam . . . . First Samael fell, and then deceiving (?) man, caused his fallalso.\"(b) The sentence: \"They were the shadows of the shadows of the Lords,\" i.e., the progenitors created man out of theirown astral bodies, explains an universal belief. The Devas are credited in the East with having no shadows of their own.\"The devas cast no shadows,\" and this is the sure sign of a good holy Spirit.Why had they \"no fire or water of their own\"?* Because:--(c) That which Hydrogen is to the elements and gases on the objective plane, its noumenon is in the world of mental orsubjective phenomena; since its trinitarian latent nature is mirrored in its three[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is corroborated, however, as we have shown, by the esotericism of Genesis. Not only are the animals created thereinafter the \"Adam of Dust,\" but vegetation is shown in the Earth before \"the heavens and the Earth were created.\" \"Everyplant of the field before it (the day that the heavens and the Earth were made, v. 4) was in the Earth\" (v. 5). Now, unlessthe Occult interpretation is accepted, which shows that in this 4th Round the Globe was covered with vegetation, and thefirst (astral) humanity was produced before almost anything could grow and develop thereon, what can the dead lettermean? Simply that the grass was in the earth of the Globe before that Globe was created? And yet the meaning of verse6, which says that \"there went up a mist from the Earth\" and watered the whole face of the Earth before it rained, andcaused the trees, etc., to grow, is plain enough. It shows also in what geological period it occurred, and further what ismeant by \"Heaven and Earth.\" It meant the firmament and dry incrustated land, separated and ridden of its vapours andexhalations. Moreover, the student must bear in mind that, as Adam Kadmon, \"the male and female being\" of Genesis,ch. I., is no physical human being but the host of the Elohim, among which was Jehovah himself -- so the animalsmentioned in that chapter as \"created\" before man in the dead letter text, were no animals, but the Zodiacal signs andother sidereal bodies.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 113 THE SECRET WORK OF CHIRAM.active emanations from the three higher principles in man, namely, \"Spirit, Soul, and Mind,\" or Atma, Buddhi, and Manas.It is the spiritual and also the material human basis.

The Spirit, beyond manifested Nature, is the fieryBREATH in its absolute Unity. In the manifested Universe, it is the Central Spiritual Sun, the electric Fire of all Life. In ourSystem it is the visible Sun, the Spirit of Nature, the terrestrial god. And in, on, and around the Earth, the fiery Spiritthereof -- air, fluidic fire; water, liquid fire; Earth, solid fire. All is fire -- ignis, in its ultimate constitution, or I, the root ofwhich is O (nought) in our conceptions, the All in nature and its mind. Pro-Mater is divine fire. It is the Creator, theDestroyer, the Preserver. The primitive names of the gods are all connected with fire, from AGNI, the Aryan, to the Jewishgod who \"is a consuming fire.\" In India, God is called in various dialects, Eashoor, Esur, Iswur, and Is'Vara, in Sanskritthe Lord, from Isa, but this is primarily the name of Siva, the Destroyer; and the three Vedic chief gods are Agni (ignis),Vayu, and Surya -- Fire, Air, and the Sun, three occult degrees of fire. In the Hebrew [[hebrew]] (aza), means toilluminate, and [[hebrew]] (asha) is fire. In Occultism, \"to kindle a fire\" is synonymous to evoking one of the three greatfire-powers, or \"to call on God.\" In Sanskrit Osch or Asch is fire or heat; and the Egyptian word Osiris is compounded (asshown by Schelling) of the two primitives aish and asr, or a \"fireenchanter.\" Aesar in the old Etruscan meant a God (beingperhaps derived from Asura of the Vedas). Aeswar and Eswara are analogous terms, as Dr. Kenealy thought. In theBhagavad Gita we read, \"Iswara resides in every mortal being and puts in motion, by his supernatural power, all thingswhich mount on the Wheel of Time.\" It is the creator and the destroyer, truly. \"The primitive fire was supposed to have aninsatiable appetite for devouring. Maximus of Tyre relates that the ancient Persians threw into the fire combustible mattercrying: 'Devour, oh Lord!' In the Irish language Easam, or Asam, means 'to create,' and Aesar was the name of an ancientIrish god, meaning 'to light a fire' \" (Kenealy).

But even this shell isall-potential, for, having generated the Earth, it is the phantom of the Moon which, attracted by magnetic affinity, sought toform its first inhabitants, the pre-human monsters, (vide supra, Stanza II.).

While the gods were generated in its androgynous bosom (Svabhavat,Mother-space) its (the Wisdom's) reflections became on Earth the woman Omoroka, who is the Chaldean Thavatth, orthe Greek Thalassa, the Deep or the Sea, which esoterically and even exoterically is the Moon. It was the Moon"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"(Omoroka) who presided over the monstrous creation of nondescript beings which were slain by the Dyanis.

THUS WAS, O LANOO, THE SECOND RACE PRODUCED (a).(a) What will be most contested by scientific authorities is this a-sexual Race, the Second, the fathers of the \"Sweat-born\"so-called, and perhaps still more the Third Race, the \"Egg-born\" androgynes. These two modes of procreation are themost difficult to comprehend, especially for the Western mind. It is evident that no explanation can be attempted for thosewho are not students of Occult metaphysics. European language has no words to express things which Nature repeats nomore at this stage of evolution, things which therefore can have no meaning for the materialist. But there are analogies. Itis not denied that in the beginning of physical evolution there must have been processes in Nature, spontaneousgeneration, for instance, now extinct, which are repeated in other forms. Thus we are told that microscopic researchshows no permanence of any particular mode of reproducing life. For \"it shows that the same organism may run throughvarious metamorphoses in the course of its life-cycle, during some of which it may be sexual, and in others a-sexual; i.e.,it may reproduce itself alternately by the co-operation of two beings of opposite sex, and also by fissure or budding fromone being only, which is of no sex.\"* \"Budding\" is the very word used in the Stanza. How could these Chhayas reproducethemselves otherwise; viz., procreate the Second Race, since they were ethereal, a-sexual, and even devoid, as yet, ofthe vehicle of desire, or Kama Rupa, which evolved only in the Third Race? They evolved the Second Raceunconsciously, as do some plants. Or, perhaps, as the Amoeba, only on a more ethereal, impressive, and larger scale. If,indeed, the cell-theory applies equally to Botany and Zoology, and extends to Morphology, as well as to the Physiology oforganisms,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Laing's \"Modern Science and Modern Thought,\" p. 90.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 117 THE OUTGROWTH OF RACES.and if the microscopic cells are looked upon by physical science as independent living beings -- just as Occultism regardsthe \"fiery lives\"* -- there is no difficulty in the conception of the primitive process of procreation.Consider the first stages of the development of a germ-cell. Its nucleus grows, changes, and forms a double cone orspindle, thus, [[diagram]] within the cell. This spindle approaches the surface of the cell, and one half of it is extruded inthe form of what are called the \"polar cells.\" These polar cells now die, and the embryo develops from the growth andsegmentation of the remaining part of the nucleus which is nourished by the substance of the cell. Then why could notbeings have lived thus, and been created in this way -- at the very beginning of human and mammalian evolution?This may, perhaps, serve as an analogy to give some idea of the process by which the Second Race was formed fromthe First.The astral form clothing the Monad was surrounded, as it still is, by its egg-shaped sphere of aura, which herecorresponds to the substance of the germ-cell or ovum. The astral form itself is the nucleus, now, as then, instinct with theprinciple of life."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"When the season of reproduction arrives, the sub-astral \"extrudes\" a miniature of itself from the egg of surrounding aura.This germ grows and feeds on the aura till it becomes fully developed, when it gradually separates from its parent,carrying with it its own sphere of aura; just as we see living cells reproducing their like by growth and subsequent divisioninto two.The analogy with the \"polar cells\" would seem to hold good, since their death would now correspond to the changeintroduced by the separation of the sexes, when gestation in utero, i.e., within the cell, became the rule.\"The early Second (Root) Race were the Fathers of the 'Sweat-born'; the later Second (Root) Race were 'Sweat-born'themselves.\"This passage from the Commentary refers to the work of evolution from the beginning of a Race to its close. The \"Sons ofYoga,\" or the primitive astral race, had seven stages of evolution racially, or collectively; as every individual Being in ithad, and has now. It is not Shakespeare only who divided the ages of man into a series of seven, but Nature herself.Thus the first sub-races of the Second Race were born at first by the process described on the law of analogy; while thelast began gradually, pari passu with the evolution of the human body, to be formed otherwise. The process ofreproduction had seven stages also[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Book I. Part I.

What physiologist or biologist could tell whether the present mode ofgeneration, with all its phases of gestation, is older than half a million, or at most one million of years, since their cycle ofobservation began hardly half a century ago.Primeval human hermaphrodites are a fact in Nature well known to the ancients, and form one of Darwin's greatestperplexities. Yet there is certainly no impossibility, but, on the contrary, a great probability that hermaphroditism existed inthe evolution of the early races; while on the grounds of analogy, and on that of the existence of one universal law inphysical evolution, acting indifferently in the construction of plant, animal, and man, it must be so. The mistaken theoriesof mono-genesis, and the descent of man from the mammals instead of the reverse, are fatal to the completeness ofevolution as taught in modern schools on Darwinian lines, and they will have to be abandoned in view of the insuperabledifficulties which they encounter. Occult tradition -- if the terms Science and Knowledge are denied in this particular toantiquity -- can alone reconcile the inconsistencies and fill the gap. \"If thou wilt know the invisible, open thine eye wide onthe visible,\" says a Talmudic axiom.In the \"Descent of Man\"* occurs the following passage; which shows how near Darwin came to the acceptance of thisancient teaching.\"It has been known that in the vertebrate kingdom one sex bears rudiments of various accessory parts appertaining to thereproductive system, which properly belong to the opposite sex. . . . Some remote progenitor of the whole vertebratekingdom appears to have been hermaphrodite or androgynous** . . . But here we encounter a singular difficulty. In themammalian class the males possess rudiments of a uterus with the adjacent passages in the Vesiculae prostaticae; theybear also rudiments of mammae, and some male marsupials have traces of a marsupial sac. Other analogous facts couldbe added. Are we then to suppose that some extremely ancient mammal continued androgynous after it had acquired thechief distinctions of its class, and therefore after it had diverged from the lower classes of the vertebrate kingdom? Thisseems very improbable,*** for we have to look to fishes, the lowest of all the classes, to find any still existentandrogynous forms.\"Mr. Darwin is evidently strongly disinclined to adopt the hypothesis which the facts so forcibly suggest, viz., that of aprimeval androgynous[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Second Edition, p. 161.** And why not all the progenitive first Races, human as well as animal; and why one \"remote progenitor\"?*** Obviously so, on the lines of Evolutionism, which traces the mammalia to some amphibian ancestor.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 119 THE BLASTEMA OF SCIENCE.stem from which the mammalia sprang. His explanation runs:-- \"The fact that various accessory organs proper to eachsex, are found in a rudimentary condition in the opposite sex may be explained by such organs having been graduallyacquired by the one sex and then transmitted in a more or less imperfect condition to the other.\" He instances the case of\"spurs, plumes, and brilliant colours, acquired for battle or for ornament by male birds\" and only partially inherited by theirfemale descendants. In the problem to be dealt with, however, the need of a more satisfactory explanation is evident, thefacts being of so much more prominent and important a character than the mere superficial details with which they arecompared by Darwin. Why not candidly admit the argument in favour of the hermaphroditism which characterises the oldfauna? Occultism proposes a solution which embraces the facts in a most comprehensive and simple manner. Theserelics of a prior androgyne stock must be placed in the same category as the pineal gland, and other organs asmysterious, which afford us silent testimony as to the reality of functions which have long since become atrophied in thecourse of animal and human progress, but which once played a signal part in the general economy of primeval life."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The occult doctrine, anyhow, can be advantageously compared with that of the most liberal men of science, who havetheorised upon the origin of the first man.Long before Darwin, Naudin, who gave the name of Blastema to that which the Darwinists call protoplasm, put forward atheory half occult and half scientifico-materialistic. He made Adam, the a-sexual, spring suddenly from the clay, as it iscalled in the Bible, the Blastema of Science. \"It is from this larval form of mankind that the evolutive force effected thecompletion of species. For the accomplishment of this great phenomenon, Adam had to pass through a phase ofimmobility and unconsciousness, very analogous to the nymphal state of animals undergoing metamorphosis,\" explainsNaudin. For the eminent botanist, Adam was not one man, however, but mankind, \"which remained concealed within atemporary organism . . . . distinct from all others and never contracting alliance with any of these.\" He shows thedifferentiation of sexes accomplished by \"a process of germination similar to that of Medusae and Ascidians.\" Mankind,thus constituted physiologically, \"would retain a sufficient evolutive force for the rapid production of the various greathuman races.\"De Quatrefages criticises this position in the \"Human Species.\" It is unscientific, he says, or, properly speaking, Naudin'sideas \"do not form a scientific theory,\" inasmuch as primordial Blastema is connected------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 120 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.in his theory with the First Cause, which is credited with having made potentially in the Blastema all past, present, andfuture beings, and thus of having in reality created these beings en masse; moreover, Naudin does not even consider thesecondary Causes, or their action in this evolution of the organic world. Science, which is only occupied with SecondaryCauses, has thus \"nothing to say to the theory of Naudin\" (p. 125).Nor will it have any more to say to the occult teachings, which are to some extent approached by Naudin. For if we butsee in his \"primordial Blastema\" the Dhyan-Chohanic essence, the Chhaya or double of the Pitris, which contains withinitself the potentiality of all forms, we are quite in accord. But there are two real and vital differences between ourteachings. M. Naudin declares that evolution has progressed by sudden leaps and bounds, instead of extending slowlyover millions of years; and his primordial Blastema is endowed only with blind instincts -- a kind of unconscious FirstCause in the manifested Kosmos -- which is an absurdity. Whereas it is our Dhyan Chohanic essence -- the causality ofthe primal cause which creates physical man -- which is the living, active and potential matter, pregnant per se with thatanimal consciousness of a superior kind, such as is found in the ant and the beaver, which produces the long series ofphysiological differentiations. Apart from this his \"ancient and general process of creation\" from proto-organisms is asoccult as any theory of Paracelsus or Khunrath could be.Moreover, the Kabalistic works are full of the proof of this. The Zohar, for instance, says that every type in the visible hasits prototype in the invisible Universe. \"All that which is in the lower (our) world is found in the upper. The Lower and theUpper act and react upon each other.\" (Zohar, fol. 186.) Vide infra, Part II., \"Esoteric Tenets corroborated in everyScripture.\"-------20. THEIR FATHERS WERE THE SELF-BORN. THE SELF-BORN, THE CHHAYA FROM THE BRILLIANT BODIES OFTHE LORDS, THE FATHERS, THE SONS OF TWILIGHT (a).(a) The \"shadows,\" or Chhayas, are called the sons of the \"self-born,\" as the latter name is applied to all the gods andBeings born through the WILL, whether of Deity or Adept. The Homunculi of Paracelsus would, perhaps, be also giventhis name, though the latter process is on a far more material plane. The name \"Sons of Twilight\" shows that the \"Self-born\" progenitors of our doctrine are identical with the Pitris------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 121 LEDA, CASTOR AND POLLUX.of the Brahmanical system, as the title is a reference to their mode of birth, these Pitris being stated to have issued fromBrahma's \"body of twilight.\" (See the Puranas.)-------21. WHEN THE RACE BECAME OLD, THE OLD WATERS MIXED WITH THE FRESHER WATERS (a); WHEN THEDROPS BECAME TURBID, THEY VANISHED AND DISAPPEARED, IN THE NEW STREAM, IN THE HOT STREAM OFLIFE. THE OUTER OF THE FIRST BECAME THE INNER OF THE SECOND. (b). THE OLD WING BECAME THESHADOW, AND THE SHADOW OF THE WING (c).(a) The old (primitive) Race merged in the second race, and became one with it.(b) This is the mysterious process of transformation and evolution of mankind. The material of the first forms -- shadowy,ethereal, and negative -- was drawn or absorbed into, and thus became the complement of the forms of the SecondRace. The Commentary explains this by saying that, as the First Race was simply composed of the astral shadows of thecreative progenitors, having of course neither astral nor physical bodies of their own -- this Race never died. Its \"men\"melted gradually away, becoming absorbed in the bodies of their own \"sweat-born\" progeny, more solid than their own.The old form vanished and was absorbed by, disappeared in, the new form, more human and physical. There was nodeath in those days of a period more blissful than the Golden Age; but the first, or parent material was used for theformation of the new being, to form the body and even the inner or lower principles or bodies of the progeny.(c) When the shadow retires, i.e. when the astral body becomes covered with more solid flesh, man develops a physicalbody. The \"wing,\" or the ethereal form that produced its shadow and image, became the shadow of the astral body and itsown progeny. The expression is queer but original."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"As there may be no occasion to refer to this mystery later, it is as well to point out at once the dual meaning contained inthe Greek myth bearing upon this particular phase of evolution. It is found in the several variants of the allegory of Ledaand her two sons Castor and Pollux, which variants have each a special meaning. Thus in Book XI. of the Odyssey, Ledais spoken of as the spouse of Tyndarus, who gave birth by her husband \"to two sons of valiant heart\" -- Castor------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 122 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and Pollux. Jupiter endows them with a marvellous gift and privilege. They are semi-immortal; they live and die, each inturn, and every alternate day; [[eteremeroi*]]. As the Tyndaridae, the twin brothers are an astronomical symbol, and standfor Day and Night; their two wives, Phoebe and Hilasira, the daughters of Apollo or the Sun, personifying the Dawn andthe Twilight.** Again, in the allegory where Zeus is shown as the father of the two heroes -- born from the egg to whichLeda gives birth -- the myth is entirely theogonical. It relates to that group of cosmic allegories in which the world isdescribed as born from an egg. For Leda assumes in it the shape of a white swan when uniting herself to the DivineSwan.*** Leda is the mythical bird, then, to which, in the traditions of various peoples of the Aryan race, are attributedvarious ornithological forms of birds which all lay golden eggs.**** In the Kalevala (the Epic Poem of Finland), thebeauteous daughter of the Ether, \"the Water Mother,\" creates the world in conjunction with a \"Duck\" (another form of theSwan or Goose, Kalahansa), who lays six golden eggs, and the seventh, \"an egg of iron,\" in her lap. But the variant of theLeda allegory which has a direct reference to mystic man is found in Pindar***** only, with a slighter reference to it in theHomeric hymns.****** Castor and Pollux are in it no longer the Dioscuri (of Apollodorus III. 10, 7); but become the highlysignificant symbol of the dual man, the Mortal and the Immortal. Not only this, but as will now be seen, they are also thesymbol of the Third Race, and its transformation from the animal man into a god-man with only an animal body.Pindar shows Leda uniting herself in the same night to her husband and also to the father of the gods -- Zeus. ThusCastor is the son of the Mortal, Pollux the progeny of the Immortal. In the allegory made up for the occasion, it is said thatin a riot of vengeance against the Apherides******* Pollux kills Lynceus -- \"of all mortals he whose sight is the mostpenetrating\" -- but Castor is wounded by Idas, \"he who sees and knows.\" Zeus puts an end to the fight by hurling histhunderbolt and killing the last two combatants. Pollux finds his brother dying.******** In[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Odyssey,\" xi. 298 to 305; \"Iliad,\" iii., 243.** Chants Cypriaques, Hyg. Tal., 80.

This semi-immortality, which is also to be shared by Castor, is accepted by Pollux.* And thus the twinbrothers live alternately, one during the day, and the other during the night.**Is this a poetical fiction only? An allegory, one of those \"solar myth\" interpretations, higher than which no modernOrientalist seems able to soar? Indeed, it is much more. Here we have an allusion to the \"Egg-born,\" Third Race; the firsthalf of which is mortal, i.e., unconscious in its personality, and having nothing within itself to survive***; and the latter halfof which becomes immortal in its individuality, by reason of its fifth principle being called to life by the informing gods, andthus connecting the Monad with this Earth. This is Pollux; while Castor represents the personal, mortal man, an animal ofnot even a superior kind, when unlinked from the divine individuality. \"Twins\" truly; yet divorced by death forever, unlessPollux, moved by the voice of twinship, bestows on his less favoured mortal brother a share of his own divine nature, thusassociating him with his own immortality.Such is the occult meaning of the metaphysical aspect of the allegory. The widely spread modern interpretation of it -- socelebrated in antiquity, Plutarch tells us,**** as symbolical of brotherly devotion -- namely, that it was an image borrowedfrom the spectacle of Nature -- is weak and inadequate to explain the secret meaning. Besides the fact that the Moon,with the Greeks, was feminine in exoteric mythology, and could therefore hardly be regarded as Castor -- and at the sametime be identified with Diana -- ancient symbologists who held the Sun, the King of all sidereal orbs, as the visible imageof the highest deity, would not have personified it by Pollux, a demi-god only.*****[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Pindar.

Of these sciences several have now become exoteric -- such as Astronomy, for instance, in its purelymathematical and physical aspect. Hence their dogmas and tenets, being all symbolised and left to the sole guardianshipof parable and allegory, have been forgotten, and their meaning has become perverted. Nevertheless, one finds thehermaphrodite in the scriptures and traditions of almost every nation; and why such unanimous agreement if thestatement is only a fiction?It is this secrecy which led the Fifth Race to the establishment, or rather the re-establishment of the religious mysteries, inwhich ancient truths might be taught to the coming generations under the veil of allegory and symbolism. Behold theimperishable witness to the evolution of the human races from the divine, and especially from the androgynous Race --the Egyptian Sphinx, that riddle of the Ages! Divine wisdom incarnating on earth, and forced to taste of the bitter fruit ofpersonal experience of pain and suffering, generated under the shade of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil -- asecret first known only to the Elohim, the SELF-INITIATED, \"higher gods\" -- on earth only.*In the Book of Enoch we have Adam,** the first divine androgyne,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Moon, conceived as twins . . .

SeeDecharme, p. 655.)* See \"Book of Enoch.\"** Adam (Kadmon) is, like Brahma and Mars, the symbol of the generative and creative power typifying Water and Earth -- an alchemical secret. \"It takes Earth and Water to create a human soul,\" said Moses. Mars is the Hindu Mangala, theplanet Mars, identical with Kartikeya, the \"War-God,\" born of Gharma-ja (Siva's sweat) and of the [[Footnote continued onnext page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 125 JAH-HOVAH ANDROGYNOUS.separating into man and woman, and becoming JAH-HEVA in one form, or Race, and Cain and Abel* (male and female)in its other form or Race -- the double-sexed Jehovah** -- an echo of its Aryan prototype, Brahma-Vach. After which comethe Third and Fourth Root-Races of mankind*** -- that is to say, Races of men and women, or individuals of oppositesexes, no longer sexless semi-spirits and androgynes, as were the two Races which precede them. This fact is hinted atin every Anthropogony. It is found in fable and allegory, in myth and revealed Scriptures, in legend and tradition.Because, of all the great Mysteries, inherited by Initiates from hoary antiquity, this is one of the greatest. It accounts forthe bi-sexual element found in every creative deity, in Brahma-Viraj-Vach, as in Adam-Jehovah-Eve, also in \"Cain-Jehovah-Abel.\" For \"The Book of the Generations of Adam\" does not even mention Cain and Abel, but says only: \"Maleand female created he them. . . and called their name Adam\" (ch. v. 5). Then it proceeds to say: \"And Adam begat a sonin his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth\" (v. 3); after which he begets other sons and daughters,thus proving that Cain and Abel are his own allegorical permutations. Adam stands for the primitive human race,especially in its cosmo-sidereal sense. Not so, however, in its theo-anthropological meaning. The compound name ofJehovah, or Jah-Hovah, meaning male life and female life -- first androgynous, then separated into sexes -- is used in thissense in Genesis from ch. v. onwards. As the author of \"The Source of Measures\" says (p. 159): \"The two words of whichJehovah is composed make up the original idea of male-female, as the birth originators\"; for the Hebrew letter Jod wasthe membrum virile and Hovah was Eve, the mother of all living, or the procreatrix, Earth and Nature. The authorbelieves, therefore, that \"It is seen that the perfect one\" (the perfect female circle or Yoni, 20612, numerically), \"asoriginator of measures, takes also the form of birth-origin, as Hermaphrodite one; hence the phallic form and use.\""},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Precisely; only \"the phallic form and use\" came long ages later; and the first and original meaning of Enos, the son ofSeth, was the First Race born in the present usual way from man and woman --for Seth is no man, but a race.

Seth represents the later Third Race.To screen the real mystery name of AIN-SOPH -- the Boundless and Endless No-Thing -- the Kabalists have broughtforward the compound attribute-appellation of one of the personal creative Elohim, whose name was Yak and Jab, theletters i or j or y being interchangeable, or Jah-Hovah, i.e. male and female;* Jah-Eve an hermaphrodite, or the first formof humanity, the original Adam of Earth, not even Adam Kadmon, whose \" mind-born son\" is the earthly Jah-Hovah,mystically. And knowing this, the crafty Rabbin-Kabalist has made of it a name so secret, that he could not divulge it lateron without exposing the whole scheme; and thus he was obliged to make it sacred.How close is the identity between Brahma-Prajapati and Jehovah-Sephiroth, between Brahma-Viraj and Jehovah-Adam,the Bible and the Puranas compared can alone show. Analysed and read in the same light, they afford cogent evidencethat they are two copies of the same original -- made at two periods far distant from each other. Compare once more inrelation to this subject Genesis ch. 4. verses 1 and 26 and Manu I., and they will both yield their meaning. In Manu (BookI. 32) Brahma, who is also both man and god, and divides his body into male and female, stands in his esoteric meaning,as does Jehovah or Adam in the Bible, for the symbolical personification of creative and generative power, both divineand human. The Zohar affords still more convincing proof of identity, while some Rabbins repeat word for word certainoriginal Puranic expressions; e.g., the \"creation\" of the world is generally considered in the Brahmanical books to be theLila, delight or sport, the amusement of the Supreme Creator, \"Vishnu being thus discrete and indiscrete substance,spirit, and time, sports like a playful boy in frolics.\" (Vishnu Purana, Book I., ch. ii.) Now compare this with what is said inthe Book, \"Nobeleth' Hokhmah\": \"The Kabalists say that the entering into existence of the worlds happens throughdelight, in that Ain-Soph (? !) rejoiced in Itself, and flashed and beamed from Itself to Itself . . . . which are all calleddelight,\" etc. (Quoted in Myer's \"Qabbalah,\" p. 110). Thus it is not a \"curious idea of the Qabbalists,\" as the author justquoted remarks, but a purely Puranic, Aryan idea. Only, why make of Ain-Soph a Creator?The \"Divine Hermaphrodite\" is then Brahma-Vach-Viraj; and that of the Semites, or rather of the Jews, is Jehovah-Cain-Abel.

The Jews regard the namegiven to them -- the Yah-oudi -- as an insult. Yet they have, or would have if they only wished it, as undeniable a right tocall themselves the ancient Yah-oudi, \"Jah-hovians,\" as the Brahmins have to call themselves Brahmins, after theirnational deity. For Jah-hovah is the generic name of that group or hierarchy of creative planetary angels, under whosestar their nation has evolved. He is one of the planetary Elohim of the regent group of Saturn. Verse 26 of Genesis, ch.iv., when read correctly, would alone give them such a right, for it calls the new race of men sprung from Seth and Enos,Jehovah, something quite different from the translation adopted in the Bible:-- \"To him also, was born a son, Enos; thenbegan men to call themselves Jah or Yah-hovah,\" to with men and women, the \"lords of creation.\" One has but to readthe above-mentioned verse in the original Hebrew text and by the light of the Kabala, to find that, instead of the words asthey now stand translated, it is:-- \"Then began men to call themselves Jehovah,\" which is the correct translation, and not\"Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord\"; the latter being a mistranslation, whether deliberate or not. Againthe well-known passage: \"I have gotten a man from the Lord,\" should read: \"I have gotten a man, even Jehovah.\"* Luthertranslated the passage one way, the Roman Catholics quite differently. Bishop Wordsworth renders it: \"Cain -- I havegotten Kain, from Kanithi, I have gotten.\" Luther: \"I have gotten a man 0-- even the Lord\" (Jehovah); and the author of\"The Source of Measures\": \"I have measured a man, even Jehovah.\" The last is the correct rendering, because (a) afamous Rabbin, a Kabalist, explained the passage to the writer in precisely this way, and (b) because this rendering isidentical with that in the Secret Doctrine of the East with regard to Brahma. In \"Isis Unveiled,\"** it was explained by thewriter that \"Cain . . . is the son of the 'Lord' not of Adam (Genesis iv. I)\" The \"Lord\" is Adam Kadmon, the \"father\" ofYodcheva, \"Adam-Eve,\" or Jehovah, the son of sinful thought, not the progeny of flesh and blood. Seth, on the otherhand, is the leader and the progenitor of the Races of the Earth; for he is the son of Adam, exoterically, but esotericallyhe is the progeny of Cain and Abel, since Abel or Hebel is a female, the counterpart and female half of the male Cain,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"and Adam is the collective name for man and woman: \"male and female (Zachar va Nakobeh) created he them . . . andcalled their name Adam.\" The verses in Genesis from chs. i. to v., are purposely mixed up for Kabalistic reasons.

These represent distinctRoot-Races, for millions of years elapsed between them.Hence the Aryan and the Semitic Theo-anthropographies are two leaves on the same stem; their respectivepersonifications and symbolic personages standing in relation to each other in this way.I. The Unknowable, referred to in various ways in Rig Vedic verse, such as \"Nought Was,\" called, later on \"Parabrahm;\"the [[diagram]] (Ain, nothing, or the \"Ain-Soph\" of the Kabalists), and again, the \"Spirit\" (of God) that moves upon the faceof the waters, in Genesis. All these are identical. Moreover, in Genesis, ch. i., v. 2, is placed as verse 1 in the secretKabalistic texts, where it is followed by the Elohim \"creating the Heaven and the Earth.\" This deliberate shifting of theorder of the verses was necessary for monotheistic and Kabalistic purposes. Jeremiah's curse against those Elohim(gods) who have not created the Heavens and the Earth, ch. x., v. 11, shows that there were other Elohim who had.II. The \"Heavenly\" Manu-Swayambhuva, who sprang from Swayambhu-Narayana, the \"Self-existent,\" and Adam Kadmonof the Kabalists, and the androgyne MAN of Genesis ch. 1 are also identical.III. Manu-swayambhuva is Brahma, or the Logos; and he is Adam Kadmon, who in Genesis iv., 5, separates himself intotwo halves, male and female, thus becoming Jah-Hovah or Jehovah-Eve; as Manu Swayambhuva or Brahma separateshimself to become \"Brahma-Viraj and Vach-Viraj,\" male and female; all the rest of the texts and versions being blinds.IV. Vach is the daughter of Brahma and is named Sata-Rupa, \"the hundred-formed,\" and Savitri, \"generatrix,\" the motherof the gods and of all living. She is identical with Eve, \"the mother (of all the lords or gods or) of all living.\" Besides thisthere are many other occult meanings.What is written in \"Isis,\" although scattered about and very cautiously expressed at the time, is correct:Explaining esoterically Ezekiel's wheel,* it is said of Jodhevah or Jehovah: -\"When the ternary is taken in the beginning of the Tetragram, it expresses the divine creation spiritually, without anycarnal sin; taken at its opposite end it expresses the latter: it is feminine. The name of Eva is composed of three letters,that of the primitive or heavenly[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Isis Unveiled,\" Vol. II., p. 462.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 129 THE JEWISH GOD-NAME.Adam, is written with one letter, Jod or Yodh; therefore it must not be read Jehovah but Ieva, or Eve. The Adam of thefirst chapter is the spiritual, therefore pure, androgyne Adam Kadmon. When woman issues from the rib of the secondAdam (of dust), the pure Virgo is separated, and falling \"into generation,\" or the downward cycle, becomes Scorpio,emblem of sin and matter. While the ascending cycle points to the purely spiritual races, or the ten prediluvian patriarchs,the Prajapatis and Sephiroth are led on by the creative Deity itself, who is Adam Kadmon or Yod-cheva. Spiritually, thelower one (Jehovah) is that of the terrestrial races, led on by Enoch or Libra, the seventh; who, because he is half-divine,half-terrestrial, is said to have been taken by God alive. Enoch, Hermes, and Libra, are one.\"This is only one of the several meanings. No need to remind the scholar that Scorpio is the astrological sign of the organsof reproduction. Like the Indian Rishis, the Patriarchs are all convertible in their numbers, as well as interchangeable.According to the subject to which they relate they become ten, twelve, seven or five, and even fourteen, and they havethe same esoteric meaning as the Manus or Rishis.Moreover, Jehovah, as may be shown, has a variety of etymologies, but only those are true which are found in theKabala. [[hebrew]] (Ieve) is the Old Testament term, and was pronounced Ya-va. Inman suggests that it is contractedfrom the two words [[hebrew]] Yaho-Iah, Jaho-Jah, or Jaho is Jah. Punctuated it is [[hebrew]] which is, however, aRabbinical caprice to associate it with the name Adoni or [[hebrew]], which has the same points. It is curious, and indeedhardly conceivable, that the Jews anciently read the name [[hebrew]] (Adoni), when they had so many names of whichJeho and Jah and Iah constituted a part. But so it was; and Philo Byblus, who gives us the so-called fragment ofSanchoniathon, spelt it in Greek letters [[IEUO]], Javo or Jevo. Theodoret says that the Samaritans pronounced Yahva,and the Jews Yaho. Prof. Gibbs, however, suggests its punctuation thus: [[hebrew]] (Ye-hou-vih); and he cut the Gordianknot of its true occult meaning. For in this last form, as a Hebrew verb, it means \"he will -- be.\"* It was also derived fromthe Chaldaic verb [[hebrew]] or [[hebrew]] eue (eva) or eua (Eva) \"to be.\" And so it was, since from Enosh, the \"Son ofMan,\" only, were the truly human races to begin and \"to be,\" as males and females. This statement receives furthercorroboration, inasmuch as Parkhurst makes the verb [[hebrew]] to mean: (1) \"To"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See for comparison Hosea, xii. 6, where it is so punctuated.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 130 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.fall down\" (i.e. into generation or matter); and (2) \"To be, to continue \" -- as a Race. The aspirate of the word eua (Eva)\"to be\" being [[hebrew]] Heve (Eve), which is the feminine of [[hebrew]] and the same as Hebe, the Grecian goddess ofyouth and the Olympian bride of Heracles, makes the name Jehovah appear still more clearly in its primitive double-sexed form.Finding in Sanskrit such syllables as Jah and Yah, e.g., Jah (navi) \"Ganges\" and Jagan-natha, \"Lord of the World,\" itbecomes clear why Mr. Rawlinson is so very confident in his works of an Aryan or Vedic influence on the early mythologyof Babylon. Nor is it to be much wondered at that the alleged ten tribes of Israel disappeared during the captivity period,without leaving a trace behind them, when we are informed that the Jews had de facto but two tribes -- those of Judahand of Levi. The Levies, moreover, were not a tribe at all, but a priestly caste. The descendants have only followed theirprogenitors, the various patriarchs, into thin, sidereal air. There were Brahms and A-brahms, in days of old, truly, andbefore the first Jew had been born. Every nation held its first god and gods to be androgynous; nor could it be otherwise,since they regarded their distant primeval progenitors, their dual-sexed ancestors, as divine Beings and Gods, just as dothe Chinese to this day. And they were divine in one sense, as also were their first human progeny, the \"mind-born\"primitive humanity, which were most assuredly bi-sexuals as all the more ancient symbols and traditions show. Under theemblematical devices and peculiar phraseology of the priesthood of old, lie latent hints of sciences as yet undiscoveredduring the present cycle. Well acquainted as may be a scholar with the hieratic writing and hieroglyphical system of theEgyptians, he must first of all learn to sift their records. He has to assure himself, compasses and rule in hand, that thepicture writing he is examining fits, to a line, certain fixed geometrical figures which are the hidden keys to such records,before he ventures on an interpretation.\"\"But there are myths which speak for themselves. In this class we may include the double-sexed first creators of everyCosmogony. The Greek Zeus-Zen (AEther), and Chthonia (the chaotic earth) and Metis (water), his wives; Osiris and Isis-Latona -- the former god also representing AEther, the first emanation of the Supreme Deity, Amun, the primeval sourceof Light; the goddess Earth and Water again; Mithras, the rock-born god, the symbol of the male mundane fire, or thepersonified primordial light, and Mithra, the fire goddess, at once his mother and his wife; the pure element of fire (theactive, or male principle) regarded as light and heat, in conjunction with Earth and Water, or Matter, the female or passiveelement of cosmical generation\" -- all these are records of the primeval divine Hermaphrodite.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 131 THE SWAN AND THE EGG.STANZA VI.THE EVOLUTION OF THE \"SWEAT-BORN.\"-------§§ (22) The evolution of the three races continued.

It is comparatively easy to conceive of an oviparoushumanity, since even now man is, in one sense, \"egg-born.\" Magendie, moreover, in his Precis Elementaire dePhysiologie, citing \"a case where the umbilical cord was ruptured and perfectly cicatrized,\" yet the infant was born alive,pertinently asks, \"How was the circulation carried on in this organ?\" On the next page he says: \"Nothing is at presentknown respecting the use of digestion in the foetus;\" and respecting its nutrition, propounds this query: \"What, then, canwe say of the nutrition of the foetus? Physiological works contain only vague conjectures on this point.\" \"Ah, but,\" thesceptic may urge, \"Magendie's book belongs to the last generation, and Science has since made such strides that hisstigma of ignorance can no longer be fixed upon the profession.\" Indeed; then let us turn to a very great authority uponPhysiology, viz., Sir M. Foster (Text-Book of Physiology, third edition, 1879, p. 623); and to the disadvantage of modernScience we shall find him saying, \"Concerning the rise and development of the functional activities of the embryo, ourknowledge is almost a blank.

Sir M. Foster is discreetly silent about the case of the ruptured umbilical cord cited by hisgreat French confrere."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"This is a very curious statement as explained in the Commentaries. To make it clear: The First Race having created theSecond by \"budding,\" as just explained, the Second Race gives birth to the Third -- which itself is separated into threedistinct divisions, consisting of men differently procreated. The first two of these are produced by an oviparous method,presumably unknown to modern Natural History. While the early sub-races of the Third Humanity procreated their speciesby a kind of exudation of moisture or vital fluid, the drops of which coalescing formed an oviform ball -- or shall we sayegg? -- which served as an extraneous vehicle for the generation therein of a foetus and child, the mode of procreation bythe later races changed, in its results at all events. The little ones of the earlier races were entirely sexless -- shapelesseven for all one knows*; but those of the later races were born androgynous. It is in the Third Race that the separation ofsexes occurred. From being previously a-sexual, Humanity became distinctly hermaphrodite or bi-sexual; and finally theman-bearing eggs began to give birth, gradually and almost imperceptibly in their evolutionary development, first, toBeings in which one sex predominated over the other, and, finally, to distinct men and women. And now let us search forcorroboration of these statements in the religious legends of East and West. Let us take the \"Egg-born Race\" first. Thinkof Kasyapa, the Vedic sage, and the most prolific of creators. He was the son of Marichi, Brahma's mind-born son; and heis made to become the father of the Nagas, or Serpents, among other beings. Exoterically, the Nagas are semi-divinebeings which have a human face and the tail of a serpent. Yet there was a race of Nagas, said to be a thousand innumber only, born or rather sprung from Kadra, Kasyapa's wife, for the purpose of peopling Patala, which is undeniablyAmerica, as will be shown; and there was a NAGA-Dwipa, one of the seven divisions of Bharata-Varsha, India, inhabitedby a people bearing the same name, who are allowed, even by some Orientalists, to be historical, and to have left many atrace behind them to this day.Now the point most insisted upon at present is that, whatever origin be claimed for man, his evolution took place in thisorder: (1) Sexless, as all the earlier forms are; (2) then, by a natural transition, he became,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See the \"Timaeus.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 133 BI-SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.\"a solitary hermaphrodite,\" a bi-sexual being; and (3) finally separated and became what he is now. Science teaches usthat all the primitive forms, though sexless, \"still retained the power of undergoing the processes of A-Sexualmultiplication;\" why, then, should man be excluded from that law of Nature? Bi-sexual reproduction is an evolution, aspecialized and perfected form on the scale of matter of the fissiparous act of reproduction. Occult teachings are pre-eminently panspermic, and the early history of humanity is hidden only \"from ordinary mortals;\" nor is the history of theprimitive Races buried from the Initiates in the tomb of time, as it is for profane science. Therefore, supported on the onehand by that science which shows to us progressive development and an internal cause for every external modification,as a law in Nature; and, on the other hand, by an implicit faith in the wisdom -- we may say pansophia even -- of theuniversal traditions gathered and preserved by the Initiates, who have perfected them into an almost faultless system --thus supported, we venture to state the doctrine clearly.In an able article, written some fifteen years ago, our learned and respected friend Prof. Alex. Wilder, of New York, showsthe absolute logic and necessity of believing \"The Primeval Race Double-Sexed,\" and gives a number of scientificreasons for it.* He argues firstly, \"that a large part of the vegetable creation exhibits the phenomenon of bisexuality . . .the Linnaean classification enumerating thus almost all plants. This is the case in the superior families of the vegetablekingdoms as much as in the lower forms, from the Hemp to the Lombardy Poplar and Ailanthus. In the animal kingdom, ininsect life, the moth generates a worm, as in the Mysteries the great secret was expressed: \"Taurus Draconem genuit, etTaurum Draco.\" The coral-producing family, which, according to Agassiz, 'has spent many hundreds of thousands ofyears, during the present geological period, in building out the peninsula of Florida . . . . produce their offspring fromthemselves like the buds and ramifications in a tree.' Bees are somewhat in the same line . . . . The Aphides or plant licekeep house like Amazons, and virgin parents perpetuate the Race for ten successive generations.\"What say the old sages, the philosopher-teachers of antiquity. Aristophanes speaks thus on the subject in Plato's\"Banquet\": \"Our nature of old was not the same as it is now. It was androgynous, the form and name partaking of, andbeing common to both the male and female. . . . Their bodies were round, and the manner of their running[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Extracts from that Essay in \"The Theosophist,\" of February, 1883.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 134 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.circular.* They were terrible in force and strength and had prodigious ambition. Hence Zeus divided each of them intotwo, making them weaker; Apollo, under his direction, closed up the skin.\"Meshia and Meshiane were but a single individual with the old Persians. \"They also taught that man was the product ofthe tree of life, growing in androgynous pairs, till they were separated at a subsequent modification of the human form.**\"In the Toleduth (generation) of Adam, the verse \"God created (bara, brought forth) man in his image, in the image of Godcreated he him, male and female created he them,\" if read esoterically will yield the true sense, viz.: \"The Elohim (Gods)brought forth from themselves (by modification) man in their image . . . . created they him (collective humanity, or Adam),male and female created he (collective deity) them.\"*** This will show the esoteric point. The sexless Race was their firstproduction, a modification of and from themselves, the pure spiritual existences; and this was Adam solus. Thence camethe second Race: Adam-Eve or Jod-Heva, inactive androgynes; and finally the Third, or the \"Separating Hermaphrodite,\"Cain and Abel, who produce the Fourth, Seth-Enos, etc. It is that Third, the last semi-spiritual race, which was also thelast vehicle of the divine and innate Wisdom, ingenerate in the Enochs, the Seers of that Mankind. The Fourth, which hadtasted from the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil -- Wisdom united already to earthy, and therefore impure, intelligence"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"**** had consequently to acquire that Wisdom by initiation and great struggle. And the union of Wisdom and Intelligence,the former ruling the latter, is called in the Hermetic books \"the God possessing the double fecundity of the two sexes.\"Mystically Jesus was held to be man-woman. See also in the Orphic hymns, sung during the Mysteries, we find:[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Compare Ezekiel's vision (chap. i) of the four divine beings who \"had the likeness of a man\" and yet had theappearance of a wheel, \"when they went they went upon their four sides . . . . for the spirit of the living creature was in thewheel.\"** See Prof. Wilder's Essay \"The Primeval Race Double-Sexed.\"*** Eugibinus, a Christian, and the Rabbis Samuel, Manasseh ben Israel, and Maimonides taught that \"Adam had twofaces and one person, and from the beginning he was both male and female -- male on one side and female on the other(like Manu's Brahma), but afterwards the parts were separated.\" The one hundred and thirty-ninth Psalm of David recitedby Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eliazar is evidence of this. \"Thou hast fashioned me behind and before,\" not beset as in the Bible,which is absurd and meaningless, and this shows, as Prof. Wilder thinks, \"that the primeval form of mankind wasandrogynous.\"**** See the union of Chochmah, Wisdom, with Binah, Intelligence, or Jehovah, the Demiurge, called Understanding inthe Proverbs of Solomon, ch. vii. Unto men Wisdom (divine occult Wisdom) crieth: \"Oh, ye simple, understand Wisdom;and ye fools, be of an understanding heart.\" It is spirit and matter, the nous and the psyche; of the latter of which St.James says that it is \"earthly, sensual, and devilish.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 135 THE VIRGIN THIRD RACE.\"Zeus is a male, Zeus is an immortal maid.\" The Egyptian Ammon was the goddess Neith, in his other half. Jupiter hasfemale breasts, Venus is bearded in some of her statues, and Ila, the goddess, is also Su-Dyumna, the god, asVaivasvata's progeny.\"The name Adam,\" says Professor A. Wilder, \"or man, itself implies this double form of existence. It is identical withAthamas, or Thomas (Tamil Tam), which is rendered by the Greek Didumos, a twin; if, therefore, the first woman wasformed subsequently to the first man, she must, as a logical necessity, be 'taken out of man' . . . and the side which theElohim had taken from man, 'made he a woman' (Gen. ii.). The Hebrew word here used is Tzala, which bears thetranslation we have given. It is easy to trace the legend in Berosus, who says that Thalatth (the Omoroca, or Lady ofUrka) was the beginning of creation. She was also Melita, the queen of the Moon. . . . The two twin births of Genesis, thatof Cain and Abel, and of Esau and Jacob, shadow the same idea. The name 'Hebel' is the same as Eve, and itscharacteristic seems to be feminine,\" continues the author. \"Unto thee shall be his desire,\" said the Lord God to Cain,\"and thou shalt rule over him.\" The same language had been uttered to Eve: \"Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and heshall rule over thee.\" . . .Thus the pristine bi-sexual unity of the human Third Root-Race is an axiom in the Secret Doctrine. Its virgin individualswere raised to \"Gods,\" because that Race represented their \"divine Dynasty.\" The moderns are satisfied with worshippingthe male heroes of the Fourth Race, who created gods after their own sexual image, whereas the gods of primevalmankind were \"male and female.\"As stated in Book I, the humanities developed coordinately, and on parallel lines with the four Elements, every new Racebeing physiologically adapted to meet the additional element. Our Fifth Race is rapidly approaching the Fifth Element --call it interstellar ether, if you will -- which has more to do, however, with psychology than with physics. We men havelearned to live in every climate, whether frigid or tropical, but the first two Races had nought to do with climate, nor werethey subservient to any temperature or change therein. And thus, we are taught, men lived down to the close of the ThirdRoot-Race, when eternal spring reigned over the whole globe, such as is now enjoyed by the inhabitants of Jupiter; a\"world,\" says M. Flammarion, \"which is not subject like our own to the vicissitudes of seasons nor to abrupt alternations oftemperature, but which is enriched with all the treasures of eternal spring.\" (\"Pluralite des Mondes,\" p. 69.) Thoseastronomers who maintain that Jupiter is in a molten condition, in our sense of the term, are invited to settle their disputewith this learned French------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 136 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Astronomer.* It must, however, be always borne in mind that the \"eternal spring\" referred to is only a condition cognisedas such by the Jovians. It is not \"spring\" as we know it. In this reservation is to be found the reconciliation between thetwo theories here cited. Both embrace partial truths.It is thus a universal tradition that mankind has evolved gradually into its present shape from an almost transparentcondition of texture, and neither by miracle nor by sexual intercourse. Moreover, this is in full accord with the ancientphilosophies; from those of Egypt and India with their Divine Dynasties down to that of Plato. And all these universalbeliefs must be classed with the \"presentiments\" and \"obstinate conceptions,\" some of them ineradicable, in popularfaiths. Such beliefs, as remarked by Louis Figuier, are \"frequently the outcome of the wisdom and observation of aninfinite number of generations of men.\" For, \"a tradition which has an uniform and universal existence,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* An hypothesis evolved in 1881 by Mr. Mattieu Williams seems to have impressed Astronomers but little. Says the authorof \"The Fuel of the Sun,\" in Knowledge, Dec. 23, 1881: \"Applying now the researches of Dr. Andrews to the conditions ofSolar existence . . . I conclude that the Sun has no nucleus, either solid, liquid, or gaseous, but is composed of"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"dissociated matter in the critical state, surrounded, first, by a flaming envelope, due to the recombination of thedissociated matter, and outside of this, by another envelope of vapours due to this combination.\"This is a novel theory to be added to other hypotheses, all scientific and orthodox. The meaning of the \"critical state\" isexplained by Mr. M. Williams in the same journal (Dec. 9, 1881), in an article on \"Solids, Liquids, and Gases.\" Speaking ofan experiment by Dr. Andrews on carbonic acid, the scientist says that \"when 88 [[degrees]] is reached, the boundarybetween liquid and gas vanished; liquid and gas have blended into one mysterious intermediate fluid; an indefinitefluctuating something is there filling the whole of the tube -- an etherealised liquid or a visible gas. Hold a red-hot pokerbetween your eye and the light; you will see an upflowing wave of movement of what appears like liquid air. Theappearance of the hybrid fluid in the tube resembles this, but is sensibly denser, and evidently stands between the liquidand gaseous states of matter, as pitch or treacle stands between solid and liquid.\"The temperature at which this occurs has been named by Dr. Andrews the \"critical temperature\"; here the gaseous andthe liquid states are \"continuous,\" and it is probable that all other substances capable of existing in both states have theirown particular critical temperatures.Speculating further upon this \"critical\" state, Mr. Mattieu Williams emits some quite occult theories about Jupiter and otherplanets. He says: \"Our notions of solids, liquids, and gases are derived from our experiences of the state of matter hereupon this Earth. Could we be removed to another planet, they would be curiously changed. On Mercury water would rankas one of the condensible gases; on Mars, as a fusible solid; but what on Jupiter?\"\"Recent observations justify us in regarding this as a miniature sun, with an external envelope of cloudy matter,apparently of partially-condensed water, but red-hot, or probably still hotter within. His vaporous atmosphere is evidentlyof enormous depth, and the force of gravitation being on his visible outer surface two-and-a-half [[Footnote continued onnext page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 137 EGYPTIAN BELIEF.has all the weight of scientific testimony.\"* And there is more than one such tradition in the Puranic allegories, as hasbeen shown. Moreover, the doctrine that the first Race of mankind was formed out of the chhayas (astral images) of thePitris, is fully corroborated in the Zohar. \"In the Tzalam (shadow image) of Elohim (the Pitris), was made Adam (man).(Cremona, Ed. iii., 76a; Brody, Ed. iii., 159a; \"Qabbalah,\" Isaac Myer, p. 420.)It has been repeatedly urged as an objection that, however high the degree of metaphysical thought in ancient India, yetthe old Egyptians had nothing but crass idolatry and zoolatry to boast of; Hermes, as alleged, being the work of mysticGreeks who lived in Egypt. To this, one answer can be given -- a direct proof that the Egyptians believed in the SecretDoctrine is, that it was taught to them at Initiation. Let the objectors open the \"Eclogae Physicae et Ethicae\" of Stobaeus,the Greek compiler of ancient fragments, who lived in the fifth century, A.D. The following is a transcription by him of anold Hermetic fragment, showing the Egyptian theory of the Soul. Translated word for word, it says:--\"From one Soul, that of ALL, spring all the Souls, which spread themselves as if purposely distributed through the world.These souls undergo many transformations; those which are already creeping creatures turn into aquatic animals; fromthese aquatic animals are derived land animals; and from the latter the birds. From the beings who live aloft in the air(heaven) men are born. On reaching that[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] times greater than that on our Earth's surface, the atmospheric pressure, indescending below this visible surface, must soon reach that at which the vapour of water would be brought to its criticalcondition. Therefore we may infer that the oceans of Jupiter are neither of frozen, liquid, nor gaseous water, but areoceans or atmospheres of critical water. If any fish or birds swim or fly therein, they must be very critically organized.\"As the whole mass of Jupiter is 300 times greater than that of the Earth, and its compressing energy towards the centreproportional to this, its materials, if similar to those of the Earth, and no hotter, would be considerably more dense, andthe whole planet would have a higher specific gravity; but we know by the movement of its satellites that, instead of this,its specific gravity is less than a fourth of that of the Earth. This justifies the conclusion that it is intensely hot; for evenhydrogen, if cold, would become denser than Jupiter under such pressure.\"As all elementary substances may exist as solids, liquids, or gases, or, critically, according to the conditions oftemperature and pressure, I am justified in hypothetically concluding that Jupiter is neither a solid, a liquid, nor a gaseousplanet, but a critical planet, or an orb composed internally of associated elements in the critical state, and surrounded bya dense atmosphere of their vapours and those of some of their compounds such as water. The same reasoning appliesto Saturn and other large and rarified planets.\"It is gratifying to see how scientific imagination approaches every year more closely to the borderland of our occultteachings.* \"The Day After Death,\" p. 23.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 138 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.status of men, the Souls receive the principle of (conscious) immortality, become Spirits, then pass into the choir of gods.\"--------"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"23. THE SELF-BORN WERE THE CHHAYAS, THE SHADOWS FROM THE BODIES OF THE SONS OF TWILIGHT.NEITHER WATER NOR FIRE COULD DESTROY THEM. THEIR SONS WERE (so destroyed) (a).(a) This verse cannot be understood without the help of the Commentaries. It means that the First Root-Race, the\"Shadows\" of the Progenitors, could not be injured, or destroyed by death. Being so ethereal and so little human inconstitution, they could not be affected by any element -- flood or fire. But their \"Sons,\" the Second Root-Race, could beand were so destroyed. As the \"progenitors\" merged wholly in their own astral bodies, which were their progeny; so thatprogeny was absorbed in its descendants, the \"Sweat-born.\" These were the second Humanity -- composed of the mostheterogeneous gigantic semi-human monsters -- the first attempts of material nature at building human bodies. The ever-blooming lands of the Second Continent (Greenland, among others) were transformed, in order, from Edens with theireternal spring, into hyperborean Hades. This transformation was due to the displacement of the great waters of the globe,to oceans changing their beds; and the bulk of the Second Race perished in this first great throe of the evolution andconsolidation of the globe during the human period. Of such great cataclysms there have already been four.* And we mayexpect a fifth for ourselves in due course of time.-------A FEW WORDS ABOUT \"DELUGES\" AND \"NOAHS.\"The accounts in the various Puranas about our Progenitors are as contradictory in their details as everything else. Thuswhile, in the Rig Veda, Ida (or Ila) is called the Instructress of Vaivasvata Manu, Sayana makes of her a goddesspresiding over the Earth, and the Sathapatha Brahmana shows her to be the Manu's daughter, an offering of his sacrifice,and, later on, his (Vaivasvata's) wife, by whom he begat the race of Manus. In the Puranas, again, she is Vaivasvata'sdaughter, yet the wife of Budha (Wisdom), the illegitimate son of the Moon (Soma) and the planet Jupiter's (Brihhaspati's)wife, Tara. All this, which seems a jumble to the profane, is full of philosophical meaning to the Occultist. On the very faceof the narrative a secret and sacred meaning is per-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The first occurred when what is now the North Pole was separated from the later Continents.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 139 WHAT THE FLOOD MEANS.ceivable, all the details, however, being so purposely mixed up that the experienced eye of an Initiate alone can followthem and place the events in their proper order.The story as told in the \"Mahabharata\" strikes the key-note, and yet it needs to be explained by the secret sensecontained in the Bhagavad Gita. It is the prologue to the drama of our (Fifth) Humanity. While Vaivasvata was engaged indevotion on the river bank, a fish craves his protection from a bigger fish. He saves and places it in a jar, where, growinglarger and larger, it communicates to him the news of the forthcoming deluge. It is the well-known \"Matsya Avatar,\" thefirst Avatar of Vishnu, the Dagon* of the Chaldean Xisuthrus, and many other things besides. The story is too well knownto need repetition. Vishnu orders a ship to be built, in which Manu is said to be saved along with the seven Rishis, thelatter, however, being absent from other texts. Here the seven Rishis stand for the seven Races, the seven principles,and various other things; for there is again a double mystery involved in this manifold allegory.We have said elsewhere that the great Flood had several meanings, and that it referred, as also does the FALL, to bothspiritual and physical, cosmic and terrestrial, events: as above, so it is below. The ship or ark -- navis -- in short, being thesymbol of the female generative principle, is typified in the heavens by the Moon, and on Earth by the Womb: both beingthe vessels and bearers of the seeds of life and being, which the sun, or Vishnu, the male principle, vivifies andfructifies.** The First Cosmic Flood refers to primordial creation, or the formation of Heaven and the Earths; in which caseChaos and the great Deep stand for the \"Flood,\" and the Moon for the \"Mother,\" from whom proceed all the life-germs.***But the terrestrial Deluge and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We must remember that at the head of all the Babylonian gods were Ea, Anu, and the primeval Bel; and that Ea, thefirst, was the God of Wisdom, the great \"God of Light\" and of the DEEP, and that he was identified with Oannes, or theBiblical Dagon -- the man-fish who rose out of the Persian Gulf.** See Part. II. § \"The Holy of Holies.\"*** It is far later on that the Moon became a male god; with the Hindus it was Soma, with the Chaldeans Nannak orNannar, and Sin, the son of Mulil, the older Bel. The \"Akkadians\" called him the \"Lord of Ghosts\"; and he was the god ofNipoor (Niffer) in northern Babylonia. It is Mulil who caused the waters of the Flood to fall from heaven on Earth, for whichXisuthrus would not allow him to approach his altar. As the modern Assyriologists have now ascertained, it is the northernNipoor which is the centre whence Chaldean (black) magic spread; and Eridu (the Southern) which was the primitive seatof the worship of the culture god, the god of divine wisdom -- the Sun-God being the supreme deity everywhere. With theJews, the Moon is connected with Israel's Jehovah and his seed, because Ur was the chief seat of the worship of theMoon-god, and because Abraham is said to have come from Ur, when from A-bra(h)m, he becomes Abraham.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 140 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.its story has also its dual application. In one case it has reference to that mystery when mankind was saved from utterdestruction, by the mortal woman being made the receptacle of the human seed at the end of the Third Race,* and in theother to the real and historical Atlantean submersion. In both cases the \"Host\" -- or the Manu which saved the seed -- iscalled Vaivasvata Manu. Hence the diversity between the Puranic and other versions; while in the Sathapatha Brahmana,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Vaivasvata produces a daughter and begets from her the race of Manu; which is a reference to the first humanManushyas, who had to create women by will (Kriyasakti), before they were naturally born from the hermaphrodites as anindependent sex, and who were, therefore, regarded as their creator's daughters. The Puranic accounts make of her (Idaor Ila) the wife of Budha (Wisdom), the latter version referring to the events of the Atlantean flood, when Vaivasvata, thegreat Sage on Earth, saved the Fifth Root-race from being destroyed along with the remnants of the Fourth.This is shown very clearly in the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna is made to say:--\"The Seven great Rishis, the four preceding Manus, partaking of my essence, were born from my mind: from them sprung(were born) the human races and the world.\" (Chapter X., verse 6).Here the four preceding \"Manus,\" out of the seven, are the four Races** which have already lived, since Krishna belongsto the Fifth Race, his death having inaugurated the Kali Yuga. Thus Vaivasvata[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* When Narada, the virgin-ascetic, threatened to put an end to the human race by preventing Daksha's sons fromprocreating it.** This is corroborated by a learned Brahmin. In his most excellent lectures on the Bhagavad Gita (see \"Theosophist,\"April, 1887, p. 444) the lecturer says: \"There is a peculiarity to which I must call your attention. He (Krishna) speaks hereof four Manus. Why does he speak of four? We are now in the seventh Manvantara, that of Vaivasvata. If he is speakingof the past Manus, he ought to speak of six, but he only mentions four. In some commentaries an attempt has been madeto interpret this in a peculiar manner. The word 'Chatvaraha' is separated from the word 'Manavaha,' and is made to referto Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara, and Sanatsujata, who are also included among the mind-born sons of Prajapati.But this interpretation will lead to a most absurd conclusion, and make the sentence contradict itself. The persons alludedto in the text have a qualifying clause in the sentence. It is well known that Sanaka and the other three refused to create,though the other sons had consented to do so; therefore, in speaking of those persons from whom humanity has sprunginto existence, it would be absurd to include those four also in the list. The passage must be interpreted without splittingthe compound into two nouns. The number of Manus will then be four, and the statement would then contradict thePuranic account, though it would be in harmony with the occult theory. You will recollect that it is stated (in Occultism) thatwe are now in the Fifth Root-Race. Each Root-Race is considered as the Santhathi of a particular Manu. Now, the FourthRace has passed, or, in other words, there have been four past Manus. . . . . \"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 141 VARIOUS DELUGES.Manu, the son of Surya (the Sun), and the saviour of our Race, is connected with the Seed of Life, both physically andspiritually. But, at present, while speaking of all, we have to concern ourselves only with the first two.The \"Deluge\" is undeniably an universal tradition. \"Glacial periods\" were numerous, and so were the \"Deluges,\" forvarious reasons. Stockwell and Croll enumerate some half dozen Glacial Periods and subsequent Deluges -- the earliestof all being dated by them 850,000, and the last about 100,000, years ago.* But which was our Deluge? Assuredly theformer, the one which to this date remains recorded in the traditions of all the peoples, from the remotest antiquity; theone that finally swept away the last peninsulas of Atlantis, beginning with Ruta and Daitya and ending with the(comparatively) small island mentioned by Plato. This is shown by the agreement of certain details in all the legends. Itwas the last of its gigantic character. The little deluge, the traces of which Baron Bunsen found in Central Asia, and whichhe places at about 10,000 years B.C., had nothing to do with either the semi-universal Deluge, or Noah's flood -- the latterbeing a purely mythical rendering of old traditions -- nor even with the submersion of the last Atlantean island; at least,only a moral connection.Our Fifth Race (the non-initiated portions), hearing of many deluges, confused them, and now know of but one. This onealtered the whole aspect of the globe in its interchange and shifting of land and sea.We may compare the traditions of the Peruvians:-- \"The Incas, seven in number, have repeopled the Earth after thedeluge,\" they say (Coste I, IV., p. 19); Humboldt mentions the Mexican version of the same legend, but confusessomewhat the details of the still-preserved legend concerning the American Noah. Nevertheless, the eminent Naturalistmentions twice seven companions and the divine bird which preceded the boat of the Aztecs, and thus makes fifteenelect instead of the seven and the fourteen. This was written probably under some involuntary reminiscence of Moses,who is said to have mentioned fifteen grandsons of Noah, who escaped with their grandsire. Then again Xisuthrus, theChaldean Noah, is saved and translated alive to heaven -- like Enoch -- with the seven gods, the Kabirim, or the sevendivine Titans; again the Chinese Yao has seven figures which sail with him and which he will animate when he lands, anduse for \"human seed.\" Osiris, when he enters the ark, or solar boat, takes seven Rays with him, etc., etc.Sanchoniathon makes the Aletae or Titans (the Kabirim) contemporary[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,\" xviii.; \"American Journal of Science,\" III., xi., 456; and Croll's \"Climate andTime.\" Lemuria was not submerged by a flood, but was destroyed by volcanic action, and afterwards sank.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 142 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.with Agruerus, the great Phoenician god (whom Faber sought to identify with Noah*); further, it is suspected that thename of \"Titan\" is derived from Tit-Ain -- \"the fountains of the chaotic abyss\"** (Tit-Theus, or Tityus is \"the divine deluge\");and thus the Titans, who are seven, are shown to be connected with the Flood and the seven Rishis saved by VaivasvataManu.***"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"They are the sons of Kronos (Time) and Rhea (the Earth); and as Agruerus, Saturn and Sydyk are one and the samepersonage, and as the seven Kabiri are said to be the sons of Sydyk or Kronos-Saturn, the Kabiri and Titans areidentical. For once the pious Faber was right in his conclusions when he wrote: \"I have no doubt of the seven Titans andKabiri being the same as the seven Rishis of the Hindu mythology (?), who are said to have escaped in a boat along withManu, the head (?) of the family.\"But he is less fortunate in his speculations when he adds \"The Hindoos, in their wild legends have variously perverted thehistory of the Noachidae (? !), yet it is remarkable that they seem to have religiously adhered to the number seven.\"****Hence Captain (Col.) Wilford very judiciously observes: that \"Perhaps the seven Manus, the seven Brahmadicas and theseven Rishis are the same, and make only seven individual persons.***** The seven Brahmadicas were Prajapatis, orlords 'of the prajas or creatures.' From them mankind was born, and they are probably the same with the seven Manus. . .. These seven grand ancestors of the human race were created for the purpose of replenishing the Earth withinhabitants.\" (Asiatic Researches, Vol. V. p. 246); and Faber adds that: \"the mutual resemblance of the Kabirs, the Titans,the Rishis, and the Noetic family, is too striking to be the effect of mere accident.\"******Faber was led into this mistake, and subsequently built his entire theory concerning the Kabiri, on the fact that the nameof the scriptural[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Agruerus is Kronos, or Saturn, and the prototype of the Israelitish Jehovah. As connected with Argha, the Moon or Arkof salvation, Noah is mythologically one with Saturn. But then this cannot relate to the terrestrial flood. (But see Faber's\"Kabiri,\" Vol. I, pp. 35, 43, and 45.)** See ibid., Vol. II., p. 240.*** Sanchoniathon says that the Titans were the sons of Kronos, and seven in number; and he calls them fire-worshippers, Aletae (sons of Agni?), and diluvians. Al-ait is the god of fire.**** Of which seven, let us remark, the Aryans, and not the Semites, were the originators, while the Jews got that numberfrom the Chaldeans.***** Seven individual sons of God, or Pitars and Pitris; also in this case the sons of Kronos or Saturn (Kala \"time\") andArkites, like the Kabiri and Titans, as their name -- \"lunar ancestors\" -- shows, the Moon being the Ark, or Argha, on thewatery abyss of space.****** See \"Kabiri,\" Vol. I., p. 131.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 143 THE ARKITE SYMBOLS.Japhet is on the list of the Titans contained in a verse of the Orphic hymns. According to Orpheus the names of the seven\"Arkite\" Titans (whom Faber refuses to identify with the impious Titans, their descendants) were Koeus, Kroeus, Phorcys,Kronos, Oceanus, Hyperion, and Iapetus:--[[Koion te, Kroion te melan, Phorkun te krataion,Kai Kronon, Okeanon d, 'Huperioa te Iapeponet.]]-- (Orph. apud Proclum. In Tim. lib. v. p. 295.But why could not the Babylonian Ezra have adopted the name of Iapetos for one of Noah's sons? The Kabiri, who arethe Titans, are also called Manes and their mother Mania, according to Arnobius. (Adversum Gentes, lib. III., p. 124.) TheHindus can therefore claim with far more reason that the Manes mean their Manus, and that Mania is the female Manu.(See Ramayana.) Mania is Ila or Ida, the wife and daughter of Vaivasvata Manu, from whom \"he begat the race ofManus.\" Like Rhea, the mother of the Titans, she is the Earth (Sayana making her the goddess of the Earth), and she isbut the second edition and repetition of Vach. Both Ida and Vach are turned into males and females; Ida becomingSudyumna, and Vach, \"the female Viraj,\" turning into a woman in order to punish the Gandharvas; one version referringto cosmic and divine theogony, the other to the later period. The Manes and Mania of Arnobius are names of Indianorigin, appropriated by the Greeks and Latins and disfigured by them.Thus it is no accident, but the result of one archaic doctrine common to all, of which the Israelites, through Ezra, theauthor of the modernised Mosaic books, were the latest adapters. So unceremonious were they with other people'sproperty, that Berosus (Antiquitates Libyae, I, fol. 8), shows that Titea -- of whom Diodorus makes the mother of theTitans or Diluvians (See Bibl. lib. III. p. 170) -- was the wife of Noah. For this Faber calls him the \"pseudo-Berosus,\" yetaccepts the information in order to register one proof more that the pagans have borrowed all their gods from the Jews,by transforming patriarchal material. According to our humble opinion, this is one of the best proofs possible of exactly thereverse. It shows as clearly as facts can show, that it is the Biblical pseudo-personages which are all borrowed frompagan myths, if myths they must be. It shows, at any rate, that Berosus was well aware of the source of Genesis, and thatit bore the same cosmic astronomical character as the allegories of Isis-Osiris, and the Ark, and other older \"Arkite\"symbols. For, Berosus says that \"Titea magna\" was afterwards called Aretia,* and worshipped with the Earth; and this[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Aretia is the female form of Artes (Egyptian Mars). Thence the Chaldean (and now Hebrew) word [[hebrew]] (Aretz)\"Earth.\" The author of \"Beitrage zur Kenntniss\" (Art. under \"Artes\" Mars) quotes: \"Addit Cedrenus (Salem I., 3): StellaMartis ab [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 2, Page]] 144 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.identifies \"Titea,\" Noah's consort, with Rhea, the mother of the Titans, and with Ida -- both being goddesses who presideover the Earth, and the mothers of the Manus and Manes (or Tit-an-Kabiri). And \"Titea-Aretia\" was worshipped asHorchia, says the same Berosus, and this is a title of Vesta, goddess of the Earth. \"Sicanus deificavit Aretiam, etnominavit eam lingua Janigena Horchiam.\" (Ibid. lib. V. fol. 64.)Scarce an ancient poet of historic or prehistoric days who failed to mention the sinking of the two continents -- oftencalled isles -- in one form or another. Hence the destruction, besides Atlantis, of the Phlegyae. (See Pausanias andNonus, who both tell how:\"From its deep-rooted base the Phlegyan isleStern Neptune shook, and plunged beneath the wavesIts impious inhabitants. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\"-- Dionysius lib xviii. p. 319).Faber felt convinced that the \"insulae Phlegyae\" were Atlantis. But all such allegories are more or less distorted echoes ofthe Hindu tradition about that great Cataclysm, which befell the Fourth, really human, though gigantic, Race, the onewhich preceded the Aryan. Yet, as just said, like all other legends, that of \"the Deluge has more than one meaning. Itrefers in Theogony, to pre-cosmic transformations, to spiritual correlations -- however absurd the term may sound to ascientific ear -- and also to subsequent Cosmogony; to the great FLOOD of WATERS (matter) in CHAOS, awakened andfructified by those Spirit-Rays which were swamped by, and perished in, the mysterious differentiation -- a pre-cosmicmystery, the Prologue to the drama of Being. Anu, Bel, and Noah preceded Adam Kadmon, Adam the Red, and Noah;just as Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva preceded Vaivasvata and the rest.\" (See \"Isis Unveiled.,\" Vol. II., pp. 420 et seq., whereone or two of the seven meanings are hinted at.)All this goes to show that the semi-universal deluge known to geology (first glacial period) must have occurred just at thetime allotted to it by the Secret Doctrine: namely, 200,000 years (in round numbers) after the commencement of ourFIFTH RACE, or about the time assigned by Messrs. Croll and Stockwell for the first glacial period: i.e., about 850,000years ago. Thus, as the latter disturbance is attributed by geologists and astronomers to \"an extreme eccentricity of theEarth's[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Egyptiis vocatur Ertosi (plantare, generare).

Nuah is Noah, floating on the waters in his ark; the latter being the emblem of the Argha, or Moon, thefeminine principle; Noah is the \"spirit\" falling into matter. We find him, as soon as he descends upon the Earth, planting avineyard, drinking of the wine, and getting drunk on it, i.e., the pure spirit becomes intoxicated as soon as it is finallyimprisoned in matter. The seventh chapter of Genesis is only another version of the First. Thus, while the latter reads:\"and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,\" in ch. 7 it is said\" . . . and the waters prevailed . . . and the ark went (with Noah, the spirit) upon the face of the waters.\" Thus Noah, ifidentical with the Chaldean Nuah, is the spirit vivifying matter, which latter is Chaos, represented by the DEEP, or theWaters of the Flood. In the Babylonian legend (the pre-cosmical blended with the terrestrial event) it is Ishtar (Astaroth orVenus, the lunar goddess) who is shut up in the ark and sends out \"a dove in search of dry land.\" (\"Isis Unveiled\" Vol. II,pp. 423 and 424).George Smith notes in the \"Tablets,\" first the creation of the moon, and then that of the sun: \"Its beauty and perfection areextolled, and the regularity of its orbit, which led to its being considered the type of a judge and the regulator of the world.\"If this story related simply to a cosmogonical cataclysm -- even were this latter universal -- why should the goddess Ishtaror Astoreth, the Moon, speak of the creation of the sun after the deluge? The waters might have reached as high as themountain of Nizir (Chaldean version), or Jebel Djudi (the deluge mountains of the Arabian legend), or yet Ararat (of theBiblical narrative), and even the Himalaya (of the Hindu tradition), and yet not reach the sun: the Bible itself stopped shortof such a miracle! It is evident that the deluge of the people who first recorded it had another meaning, less problematicaland far more philosophical than that of an universal deluge, of which there are no geological traces whatever.As all such Cataclysms are periodical and cyclical, and as Manu Vaivasvata figures as a generic character, under variouscircumstances and events (vide infra: \"The Seven Manus of Humanity\"), there seems to be no[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Chap. lxiv., Sect. xi.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 146 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"serious objection to the supposition that the first \"great flood\" had an allegorical, as well as a cosmic meaning, and that ithappened at the end of the Satya Yuga, the \"age of Truth,\" when the Second Root Race, \"The Manu with bones,\" madeits primeval appearance as \"the Sweat-Born.\"*The Second Flood -- the so-called \"universal\" -- which affected the Fourth Root Race (now conveniently regarded bytheology as \"the accursed race of giants,\" the CAINITES, and \"the sons of Ham\") is that flood which was first perceivedby geology. If one carefully compares the accounts in the various legends of the Chaldees and other exoteric works of thenations, it will be found that all of them agree with the orthodox narratives given in the Brahmanical books. And it may beperceived that while, in the first account, \"there is no God or mortal yet on Earth,\" when Manu Vaivasvata lands on theHimavan; in the second, the Seven Rishis are allowed to keep him company: thus showing that whereas some accountsrefer to the sidereal and cosmic FLOOD before the so-called creation, the others treat, one of the Great Flood of Matteron Earth, and the other of a real watery deluge. In the Satapatha Brahmana, Manu finds that \"the Flood had swept awayall living creatures, and he alone was left\" -- i.e., the seed of life alone remained from the previous dissolution of theUniverse, or Mahapralaya, after a \"Day of Brahma\"; and the Mahabharata refers simply to the geological cataclysm whichswept away nearly all the Fourth Race to make room for the Fifth. Therefore is Vaivasvata Manu shown under threedistinct attributes in our esoteric Cosmogony:** (a) as the \"Root-Manu\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* All such expressions are explained in the \"Anthropogenesis\" of this Book, and elsewhere.** One has to remember that, in the Hindu philosophy, every differentiated unit is such only through the cycles of Maya,being one in its essence with the Supreme or One Spirit. Hence arises the seeming confusion and contradiction in thevarious Puranas, and at times in the same Purana, about the same individual. Vishnu -- as the many-formed Brahma, andas Brahma (neuter) -- is one, and yet he is said to be all the 28 Vyasas (Vishnu Purana). \"In every Dvapara (third) age,Vishnu, in the person of Vyasa, divides the Veda, which is one, into four and many portions. Twenty-eight times have theVedas been arranged by the great Rishis in the Vaivasvata Manvantara, in the Dvapara Yuga . . . and, consequently,twenty-eight Vyasas have passed away . . . they who were all in the form of Veda-Vyasas, who were the Vyasas of theirrespective eras. . . . \" (Book III., Ch. III.) \"This world is Brahma in Brahma, from Brahma . . . nothing further to be known.\"Then, again . . . \"There were in the First Manvantara seven celebrated sons of Vasishta, who in the Third Manvantara,were sons of Brahma (i.e., Rishis), the illustrious progeny of Urja.\" This is plain: the Humanity of the First Manvantara isthat of the seventh and of all the intermediate ones. The mankind of the First Root-Race is the mankind of the second,third, fourth, fifth, etc. To the last it forms a cyclic and constant reincarnation of the Monads belonging to the DhyanChohans of our Planetary chain.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 147 AGREEMENT OF DATES.on Globe A in the First Round; (b) as the \"seed of life\" on Globe D in the Fourth Round; and (c) as the \"Seed of Man\" atthe beginning of every Root-Race -- in our Fifth Race especially. The very commencement of the latter witnesses, duringthe Dvapara Yuga,* the destruction of the accursed sorcerers; \"of that island (Plato speaking only of its last island)beyond the Pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic Ocean, from which there was an easy transition to other islands in theneighbourhood of another large Continent\" (America). It is this \"Atlantic\" land which was connected with the \"WhiteIsland,\" and this White Island was Ruta; but it was not the Atala and the \"White Devil\" of Colonel Wilford (see \"AsiaticResearches,\" Vol. VIII., p. 280), as already shown. It may well be remarked here that the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000years, according to the Sanskrit texts; and that, if the Kali Yuga began only about 5,000 years ago, that it is just 869,000since that destruction took place. Again, these figures are not very widely different from those given by the geologists,who place their \"glacial period\" 850,000 years ago.Then \"a woman was produced who came to Manu and declared herself his daughter, with whom he lived and begat theoffspring of Manu.\" This refers to the physiological transformation of sexes during the Third Root-Race. And the allegoryis too transparently clear to need much explanation. Of course, as already remarked, in the separation of sexes anandrogyne being was supposed to divide his body into two halves (as in the case of Brahma and Vach, and even ofAdam and Eve), and thus the female is, in a certain sense, his daughter, just as he will be her son, \"the flesh of his (andher) flesh and the bone of his (and her) bone.\" Let it be also well remembered that not one of our Orientalists have yetlearned to discern in those \"contradictions and amazing nonsense,\" as some call the Puranas, that a reference to a Yugamay mean a Round, a Root-Race, and often a Sub-Race, as well as form a page torn out of pre-cosmic theogony. Thisdouble and triple meaning is proved by various references to one and the same individual apparently, under an identicalname, while it refers, in fact, to events divided by entire Kalpas. A good instance is that of Ila. She is first represented asone thing and then as another. In the exoteric legends it is said that Manu Vaivasvata, desiring to create sons, instituted asacrifice to Mitra and Varuna; but, through a mistake of the officiating[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Dvapara Yuga differs for each Race. All races have their own cycles, which fact causes a great difference. Forinstance, the Fourth Sub-Race of the Atlanteans was in its Kali-Yug, when destroyed, whereas the Fifth was in its Satyaor Krita Yuga. The Aryan Race is now in its Kali Yuga, and will continue to be in it for 427,000 years longer, while various\"family Races,\" called the Semitic, Hamitic, etc., are in their own special cycles. The forthcoming 6th Sub Race -- whichmay begin very soon -- will be in its Satya (golden) age while we reap the fruit of our iniquity in our Kali Yuga.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 148 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Brahman, a daughter only was obtained -- Ila. Then, \"through the favour of the gods,\" her sex is changed and shebecomes a man, Su-dyumna. Then she is again turned into a woman, and so on; the fable adding that Siva and hisconsort were pleased that \"she would be male one month and female another.\" This has a direct reference to the ThirdRoot-Race, whose men were androgynes. But some very learned Orientalists think (see \"Hindu Classical Dictionary\") and"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"have declared that \"Ila was primarily food, nourishment, or a libation of milk; thence a stream of praise, personified as thegoddess of speech.\" The \"profane\" are not told, however, the reason why \"a libation of milk,\" or \"a stream of praise,\"should be male and female by turn: unless, indeed there is some \"internal evidence\" which the occultists fail to perceive.In their most mystical meanings, the union of Swayambhuva Manu with Vach-Sata-Rupa, his own daughter (this beingthe first \"euhemerization\" of the dual principle of which Vaivasvata Manu and Ila are a secondary and a third form), standsin Cosmic symbolism as the Root-life, the germ from which spring all the Solar Systems, the worlds, angels and the gods.For, as says Vishnu:--\"From Manu all creation, gods, Asuras, man must be produced,By him the world must be created, that which moves and moveth not. . . . .\"But we may find worse opponents than even the Western Scientists and Orientalists. If, on the question of figures,Brahmins may agree with our teaching, we are not so sure that some of them, orthodox conservatives, may not raiseobjections to the modes of procreation attributed to their Pitar Devatas. We shall be called upon to produce the worksfrom which we quote, while they will be invited by us to read their own Puranas a little more carefully and with an eye tothe esoteric meaning. And then, we repeat again, they will find, under the veil of more or less transparent allegories,every statement made herein corroborated by their own works. One or two instances have already been given as regardsthe appearance of the Second Race, which is called the \"Sweat-Born.\" This allegory is regarded as a fairy-tale, and yet itconceals a psycho-physiological phenomenon, and one of the greatest mysteries of Nature.But in view of the chronological statements made herein, it is natural to ask:--COULD MEN EXIST 18,000,000 YEARS AGO?To this Occultism answers in the affirmative, notwithstanding all scientific objectors. Moreover, this duration covers onlythe Vaivasvata-Manu Man, i.e., the male and female entity already separated into------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 149 HOW OLD IS HUMANITY?distinct sexes. The two and a half Races that preceded that event may have lived 300,000,000 years ago for all thatscience can tell. For the geological and physical difficulties in the way of the theory could not exist for the primeval,ethereal man of the Occult teachings. The whole issue of the quarrel between the profane and the esoteric sciencesdepends upon the belief in, and demonstration of, the existence of an astral body within the physical, the formerindependent of the latter. Paul d'Assier, the Positivist, seems to have proven the fact pretty plainly,* not to speak of theaccumulated testimony of the ages, and that of the modern spiritualists and mystics. It will be found difficult to reject thisfact in our age of proofs, tests, and ocular demonstrations.The Secret Doctrine maintains that, notwithstanding the general cataclysms and disturbances of our globe, which -- owingto its being the period of its greatest physical development, for the Fourth Round is the middle-point of the life allotted to it-- were far more terrible and intense than during any of the three preceding Rounds (the cycles of its earlier psychic andspiritual life and of its semi-ethereal conditions) physical Humanity has existed upon it for the last 18,000,000 years.**This period was preceded by 300,000,000 years of the mineral and vegetable development. To this, all those who refuseto accept the theory of a \"boneless,\" purely ethereal, man, will object. Science, which knows only of physical organisms,will feel indignant; and materialistic theology still more so. The first will object on logical and reasonable grounds, basedon the preconception that all animate organisms have always existed on the same plane of materiality in all the ages; thelast on a tissue of most absurd fictions. The ridiculous claim usually brought forward by theologians, is based on thevirtual assumption that mankind (read Christians) on this planet have the honour of being the only human beings in thewhole Kosmos, who dwell on a globe, and that they are consequently, the best of their kind.***[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Posthumous Humanity\" -- translated by H. S. Olcott, London, 1887.** Professor Newcomb says: \"The heat evolved by contraction would last only 18,000,000 years\" (\"Popular Astronomy,\"p. 500); but \"a temperature permitting the existence of water could not be reached earlier than 10,000,000 years ago\"(Winchell's \"World-Life,\" p. 356). But Sir W. Thomson says that the whole age of the incrustation of the Earth is18,000,000 years, though, this year, he has again altered his opinion and allows only 15,000,000 years as the age of theSun. As will be shown in the Addenda, the divergence of scientific opinions is so great that no reliance can ever beplaced upon scientific speculation.*** The essay on \"The Plurality of Worlds\" (1853) -- an anonymous work, yet well known to have been the production ofDr. Whewell -- is a good proof of this. No Christian ought to believe in either the plurality of worlds or the geological age ofthe globe, argues the Author; because, if it is asserted that this world is only one among the many of its kind, which are allthe work of God, as it is itself; that all are the seat [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 150 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The Occultists, who believe firmly in the teachings of the mother-philosophy, repel the objections of both theologians andscientists. They maintain, on their side, that, during those periods when there must have been insufferable heat, even atthe two poles, successive floods, upheaval of the valleys and constant shifting of the great waters and seas, none ofthese circumstances could form an impediment to human life and organization, such as is assigned by them to the earlymankind. Neither the heterogeneity of ambient regions, full of deleterious gases, nor the perils of a crust hardlyconsolidated, could prevent the First and Second Races from making their appearance even during the Carboniferous, orthe Silurian age itself."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Thus the Monads destined to animate future Races were ready for the new transformation. They had passed their phasesof immetalization, of plant and animal life, from the lowest to the highest, and were waiting for their human, moreintelligent form. Yet, what could the plastic modellers do but follow the laws of evolutionary Nature? Could they, asclaimed by the Biblical dead-letter, form \"Lord-God\"-like, or as Pygmalion in the Greek allegory, Adam-Galatea out ofvolcanic dust, and breathe a living soul into Man? No: because the soul was already there, latent in its Monad, andneeded but a coating. Pygmalion, who fails to animate his statue, and Bahak-Zivo of the Nazarean Gnostics, who fails toconstruct \"a human soul in the creature,\" are, as conceptions, far more philosophical and scientific than Adam, taken inthe dead-letter sense, or the Biblical Elohim-Creators. Esoteric philosophy, which teaches spontaneous generation -- afterthe Sishta and Prajapati have thrown the seed of life on the Earth -- shows the lower angels able to construct physicalman only, even with the help of Nature, after having evolved the ethereal form out of themselves, and leaving the physicalform to evolve gradually from its ethereal, or what would now be called, protoplasmic model.This will again be objected to: \"Spontaneous Generation\" is an exploded theory, we shall be told. Pasteur's experimentsdisposed of it twenty years ago, and Professor Tyndall is against it. Well, suppose he is? He ought to know that, shouldspontaneous generation[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] of life, all the realm and dwelling of intelligent creatures endowed with will,subject to law and capable of free-will; then, it would become extravagant to think that our world should have been thesubject of God's favours and His special interference, of His communications and His personal visit. . . . . . . Can the Earthpresume to be considered the centre of the moral and religious Universe, he asks, if it has not the slightest distinction torely upon in the physical Universe?

It would be interesting to know how Science could ever accountfor the appearance of species and life on Earth, especially of Man, once that she rejects both the Biblical teachings andspontaneous generation. Pasteur's observations, however, are far from being perfect or proven. Blanchard and Dr.Lutaud reject their importance and show that they have none. The question is so far left sub judice, as well as that otherone \"when, at what period, life appeared on the Earth?\" As to the idea that Haeckel's Moneron -- a pinch of salt! -- hassolved the problem of the origin of life, it is simply absurd. Those materialists, who feel inclined to pooh-pooh the theory ofthe \"Self-existent,\" the \"Self-born heavenly man,\" represented as an ethereal, astral man, must excuse even a tyro inOccultism laughing, in his turn, at some speculations of modern thought. After proving most learnedly that the primitivespeck of protoplasm (moneron) is neither animal nor plant, but both, and that it has no ancestors among either of these,since it is that moneron which serves as a point of departure for all organized existence, we are finally told that theMonera are their own ancestors. This may be very scientific, but it is very metaphysical also; too much so, even for theOccultist.If spontaneous generation has changed its methods now, owing perhaps to accumulated material on hand, so as toalmost escape detection, it was in full swing in the genesis of terrestrial life. Even the simple physical form and theevolution of species show how Nature proceeds. The scale-bound, gigantic sauria, the winged pterodactyl, theMegalosaurus, and the hundred-feet long Iguanodon of the later period, are the transformations of the earliestrepresentatives of the animal kingdom found in the sediments of the primary epoch. There was a time when all thoseabove enumerated \"antediluvian\" monsters appeared as filamentoid infusoria without shell or crust, with neither nerves,muscles, organs nor sex, and reproduced their kind by gemmation: as do microscopical animals also, the architects andbuilders of our mountain ranges, agreeably to the teachings of science. Why not man in this case? Why should he nothave followed the same law in his growth, i.e., gradual condensation? Every unprejudiced person would prefer to believethat primeval humanity had at first an ethereal -- or, if so preferred, a huge filamentoid, jelly-like form, evolved by gods ornatural \"forces,\" which grew, condensed throughout millions of ages, and became gigantic in its physical impulse andtendency, until it settled into the huge, physical form of the Fourth Race Man, -- rather------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 152 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.than believe him created of the dust of the Earth (literally), or from some unknown anthropoid ancestor.Nor does our esoteric theory clash with scientific data, except on first appearance, as Dr. A. Wilson, F.R.S., says, in aletter to \"Knowledge,\" (Dec. 23, 1881). \"Evolution -- rather Nature, in the light of evolution -- has only been studied forsome twenty-five years or so. That is, of course, a mere fractional space in the history of human thought.\" And justbecause of that we do not lose all hope that materialistic science will amend its ways, and will gradually accept theesoteric teachings -- if even at first divorced from their (to science) too metaphysical elements.Has the last word on the subject of human evolution yet been said? \"Each . . . . answer to the great Question (Man's RealPlace in Nature), invariably asserted by the followers of its propounder, if not by himself, to be complete and final,remains in high authority and esteem, it may be for one century, it may be for twenty,\" writes Prof. Huxley; \"but, asinvariably, time proves each reply to have been a mere approximation to the truth -- tolerable chiefly on account of theignorance of those by whom it was accepted, and wholly intolerable when tested by the larger knowledge of theirsuccessors\"! ! Will this eminent Darwinian admit the possibility of his pithecoid ancestry being assignable to the list of\"wholly intolerable beliefs,\" in the \"larger knowledge\" of Occultists? But whence the savage? Mere \"rising to the civilizedstate\" does not account for the evolution of form."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"In the same letter, \"The Evolution of Man,\" Dr. Wilson makes other strange confessions. Thus, he observes, in answer tothe queries put to \"Knowledge\" by \"G. M.\":--\" 'Has evolution effected any change in man? If so, what change? If not, why not?' . . . If we refuse to admit (as sciencedoes) that man was created a perfect being, and then became degraded, there exists only another supposition -- that ofevolution. If man has arisen from a savage to a civilized state, that surely is evolution. We do not yet know, because suchknowledge is difficult to acquire, if the human frame is subject to the same influences as those of lower animals. But thereis little doubt that elevation from savagery to civilized life means and implies 'evolution,' and that of considerable extent.Mentally, man's evolution cannot be doubted; the ever-widening sphere of thought has sprung from small and rudebeginnings, like language itself. But man's ways of life, his power of adaptation to his surroundings, and countless othercircumstances, have made the facts and course of his 'evolution' very difficult to trace.\"This very difficulty ought to make the Evolutionists more cautious in their affirmations. But why is evolution impossible, if\"man was created a perfect being, and then became degraded?\" At best it can only apply------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 153 ARISTOTLE DENIED HELIOCENTRICISM.to the outward, physical man. As remarked in \"Isis Unveiled,\" Darwin's evolution begins at the middle point, instead ofcommencing for man, as for everything else, from the universals. The Aristotle-Baconian method may have itsadvantages, but it has undeniably already demonstrated its defects. Pythagoras and Plato, who proceeded from theUniversals downwards, are now shown more learned, in the light of modern science, than was Aristotle. For he opposedand denounced the idea of the revolution of the earth and even of its rotundity. \"Almost all those,\" he wrote, \"who affirmthat they have studied heaven in its uniformity, claim that the earth is in the centre, but the philosophers of the ItalianSchool, otherwise called the Pythagoreans, teach entirely the contrary. . . .\" Because (a) the Pythagoreans were Initiates,and (b) they followed the deductive method. Whereas, Aristotle, the father of the inductive system, complained of thosewho taught that \"the centre of our system was occupied by the Sun, and the earth was only a star, which by a rotatorymotion around the same centre, produces night and day\" (Vide De Caelo, Book II., c. 13.) The same with regard to man.The theory taught in the Secret Doctrine, and now expounded, is the only one, which can -- without falling into theabsurdity of a \"miraculous\" man created out of the dust of the Earth, or the still greater fallacy of man evolving from apinch of lime-salt, (the ex-protoplasmic moneron) -- account for his appearance on Earth.Analogy is the guiding law in Nature, the only true Ariadne's thread that can lead us, through the inextricable paths of herdomain, toward her primal and final mysteries. Nature, as a creative potency, is infinite, and no generation of physicalscientists can ever boast of having exhausted the list of her ways and methods, however uniform the laws upon whichshe proceeds. If we can conceive of a ball of Fire-mist becoming gradually -- as it rolls through aeons of time in theinterstellar spaces -- a planet, a self-luminous globe, to settle into a man-bearing world or Earth, thus having passed froma soft plastic body into a rock-bound globe; and if we see on it everything evolving from the non-nucleated jelly-speck thatbecomes the sarcode* of the moneron, then passes from its protistic state** into the form of an animal, to grow into agigantic reptilian monster of the Mesozoic times; then dwindles again into the (comparatively) dwarfish crocodile, nowconfined solely to tropical[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Or what is more generally known as Protoplasm. This substance received its name of \"Sarcode\" from Prof. DujardinBeaumetz far earlier.** The Monera are indeed Protista. They are neither animals \"nor plants,\" writes Haeckel; \" . . . the whole body of theMoneron represents nothing more than a single thoroughly homogeneous particle of albumen in a firmly adhesivecondition.\" (\"Journal of Microscopical Science,\" Jan., 1869, p. 28.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 154 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.regions, and the universally common lizard* -- how can man alone escape the general law? \"There were giants on earthin those days,\" says Genesis, repeating the statement of all the other Eastern Scriptures; and the Titans are founded onanthropological and physiological fact.And, as the hard-shelled crustacean was once upon a time a jelly-speck, \"a thoroughly homogeneous particle of albumenin a firmly adhesive condition,\" so was the outward covering of primitive man, his early \"coat of skin,\" plus an immortalspiritual monad, and a psychic temporary form and body within that shell. The modern, hard, muscular man almostimpervious to any climate, was, perhaps, some 25,000,000 years ago, just what the Haeckelian Moneron is, strictly \"anorganism without organs,\" an entirely homogeneous substance with a structureless albumen body within, and a humanform only outwardly.No man of science has the right, in this century, to find the figures of the Brahmins preposterous in the question ofChronology; for their own calculations often exceed by far the claims made by esoteric science. This may easily beshown.Helmholtz calculated that the cooling of our Earth from a temperature of 2,000 [[degrees]] to 200' Cent. must haveoccupied a period of no less than 350,000,000 years. Western science (including geology) seems generally to allow ourglobe an age of about 500,000,000 years altogether. Sir W. Thomson, however, limits the appearance of the earliestvegetable life to 100,000,000 years ago -- a statement respectfully contradicted by the archaic records. Speculations,furthermore, vary daily in the domains of science. Meanwhile, some geologists are very much opposed to such limitation.\"Volger . . . . calculates, that the time requisite for the deposit of the strata known to us must at least have amounted to648 millions of years . . . . \" Both time and space are infinite and eternal. \"The Earth, as a material existence, is indeedinfinite; the changes only which it has undergone can be determined by finite periods of time\" (Burmeister). \"We must"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"therefore assume that the starry heaven is not merely in space, what no astronomer doubts, but also in time, withoutbeginning or end; that it never was created, and is imperishable.\" (See Czolbe).**Czolbe repeats exactly what the Occultists say.

To this the Vishnu Purana contains a reply, which has forced certain Orientalists to open their eyes verywidely.. . . \"The Sun is stationed, for all time, in the middle of the day, and over against midnight, in all the Dwipas (continents),Maitreya! But the rising and the setting of the Sun being perpetually opposite to each other -- and in the same way, all thecardinal points, and so the cross-points, Maitreya; people speak of the rising of the Sun where they see it; and where theSun disappears, there, to them, is his setting. Of the Sun, which is always in one and the same place, there is neithersetting nor rising, for what is called rising and setting are only the seeing and the not seeing the Sun.\" (Vishnu Purana,Book IL, ch. viii.)To this Fitzedward Hall remarks, \"The Heliocentricism taught in this passage is remarkable. It is contradicted, however, alittle further on.\" Contradicted purposely, because it was a secret temple-teaching. Martin Haug remarked the sameteaching in another passage. It is useless to calumniate the Aryans any longer.To return to the Chronology of the geologists and anthropologists. We are afraid Science has no reasonable grounds onwhich she could oppose the views of the Occultists in this direction. Except that \"of man, the highest organic being ofcreation, not a trace was found in the primary strata; only in the uppermost, the so-called alluvial layer,\" is all that can beurged, so far. That man was not the last member in the mammalian family, but the first in this Round, is something thatscience will be forced to acknowledge one day. A similar view also has already been mooted in France on very highauthority.That man can be shown to have lived in the mid-Tertiary period, and in a geological age when there did not yet exist onesingle specimen of the now known species of mammals, is a statement that science cannot deny and which has nowbeen proven by de Quatrefages.* But even supposing his existence in the Eocene period is not yet demonstrated, whatperiod of time has elapsed since the Cretaceous period? We are aware of the fact that only the boldest geologists dare toplace man further back than the Miocene age. But how long, we ask, is the duration of those ages and periods since theMesozoic time? On this, after a good deal of speculation and wrangling, science is silent, the greatest authorities uponthe subject being compelled to answer to the question: \"We do not know.\" This ought to show that the men of science areno greater authorities in this matter than are the profane.

But this proves very little, since the majority rarely, if ever, turns out to beright in the long run. Harvey stood alone for many years. The advocates for crossing the Atlantic with steamers were indanger of ending their days in a lunatic asylum. Mesmer is classed to this day (in the Encyclopaedias) along withCagliostro, and St. Germain, as a charlatan and impostor. And now that Messrs. Charcot and Richet have vindicatedMesmer's claims, and that \"Mesmerism\" under its new name of Hypnotism -- a false nose on a very old face -- isaccepted by science, it does not strengthen one's respect for that majority, when one sees the ease and unconcern withwhich its members treat of \"Hypnotism,\" \"Telepathic Impacts,\" and its other phenomena. They speak of it, in short, as ifthey had believed in it since the days of Solomon, and had never called its votaries, only a few years ago, \"lunatics andimpostors!\"**The same revulsion of thought is in store for the long period of years, claimed by esoteric philosophy as the age of sexualand physiological mankind. Therefore even the Stanza which says:--\"The mind-born, the boneless, gave being to the will-born with bones\"; adding that this took place in the middle of theThird Race 18,000,000 years ago -- has yet a chance of being accepted by future scientists."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"As far as XIXth century thought is concerned, we shall be told, even by some personal friends who are imbued with anabnormal respect for the shifting conclusions of science, that such a statement is absurd.

Many geologists, indeed, consider that theduration of the Quaternary and Tertiary Ages demands the concession of such an estimate; and it is quite certain that noterrestrial conditions whatever negative the hypothesis of an Eocene Man, if evidence for his reality is forthcoming.Occultists, who maintain that the above date carries us far back into the secondary or \"Reptilian\" age, may refer to M. deQuatrefages in support of the possible existence of man in that remote antiquity. But with regard to the earliest Root-Races the case is very different. If the thick agglomeration of vapours, charged with carbonic acid, that escaped from thesoil or was held in suspension in the atmosphere since the commencement of sedimentation, offered a fatal obstacle tothe life of human organisms as now known, how, it will be asked, could the primeval men have existed? Thisconsideration is, in reality, out of court. Such terrestrial conditions as were then operative had no touch with the plane onwhich the evolution of the ethereal astral races proceeded. Only in relatively recent geological periods, has the spiralcourse of cyclic law swept mankind into the lowest grade of physical evolution -- the plane of gross material causation. Inthose early ages, astral evolution was alone in progress, and the two planes, the astral and the physical,* thoughdeveloping on parallel lines, had no direct point of contact with one another. It is obvious that a shadow-like ethereal manis related by virtue of his organization -- if such it can be called -- only to that plane from which the substance of hisUpadhi is derived.There are things, perhaps, that may have escaped the far-seeing -- but not all-seeing -- eyes of our modern naturalists;yet it is Nature herself who undertakes to furnish the missing links. Agnostic speculative thinkers have to choose betweenthe version given by the Secret Doctrine of the East, and the hopelessly materialistic Darwinian and Biblical accounts ofthe origin of man; between no soul and no spiritual evolution, and the Occult doctrine which repudiates \"Special creation\"and the \"Evolutionist\" Anthropogenesis equally.Again, to take up the question of \"Spontaneous generation\"; life -- as science shows -- has not always reigned on thisterrestrial plane.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It must be noted that, though the astral and physical planes of matter ran parallel with one another even in the earliestgeological ages, yet they were not in the same phases of manifestation in which they are now. The Earth did not reach itspresent grade of density till 18,000,000 years ago. Since then both the physical and astral planes have become grosser.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 158 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.There was a time when even the Haeckelian Moneron -- that simple globule of Protoplasm -- had not yet appeared at thebottom of the seas. Whence came the Impulse which caused the molecules of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, etc., to groupthemselves into the Urschleim of Oken, that organic \"slime,\" now christened protoplasm. What were the prototypes of theMonera? They, at least, could not have fallen in meteorites from other globes already formed, Sir W. Thomson's wildtheory to this effect, notwithstanding. And if they have so fallen; if our Earth got its supply of life-germs from other planets;who, or what, had carried them into those planets? Here, again, unless the Occult teaching is accepted, we arecompelled once more to face a miracle; to accept the theory of a personal, anthropomorphic Creator, the attributes anddefinitions of whom, as formulated by the Monotheists, clash as much with philosophy and logic, as they degrade theideal of an infinite Universal deity, before whose incomprehensible awful grandeur the highest human intellect feelsdwarfed. Let not the modern philosopher, while arbitrarily placing himself on the highest pinnacle of human intellectualityhitherto evolved, show himself spiritually and intuitionally so far below the conceptions of even the ancient Greeks,themselves on a far lower level, in these respects, than the philosophers of Eastern Aryan antiquity. Hylozoism, whenphilosophically understood, is the highest aspect of Pantheism. It is the only possible escape from idiotic atheism basedon lethal materiality, and the still more idiotic anthropomorphic conceptions of the monotheists; between which two itstands on its own entirely neutral ground. Hylozoism demands absolute Divine Thought, which would pervade thenumberless active, creating Forces, or \"Creators\"; which entities are moved by, and have their being in, from, and throughthat Divine Thought; the latter, nevertheless, having no more personal concern in them or their creations, than the Sunhas in the sun-flower and its seeds, or in vegetation in general. Such active \"Creators\" are known to exist and arebelieved in, because perceived and sensed by the inner man in the Occultist. Thus the latter says that an ABSOLUTEDeity, having to be unconditioned and unrelated, cannot be thought of at the same time as an active, creating, one living"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"god, without immediate degradation of the ideal.* A Deity that manifests in Space and Time -- these two being simply theforms of THAT which is the Absolute ALL -- can be but a fractional part of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The conception and definition of the Absolute by Cardinal Cusa may satisfy only the Western mind, prisoned, sounconsciously to itself, and entirely degenerated by long centuries of scholastic and theological sophistry.

And since that \"all\" cannot be divided in its absoluteness, therefore that sensed creator (we say Creators) can beat best but the mere aspect thereof. To use the same metaphor -- inadequate to express the full idea, yet well adapted tothe case in hand -- these creators are like the numerous rays of the solar orb, which remains unconscious of, andunconcerned in, the work; while its mediating agents, the rays, become the instrumental media every spring -- theManvantaric dawn of the Earth -- in fructifying and awakening the dormant vitality inherent in Nature and its differentiatedmatter. This was so well understood in antiquity, that even the moderately religious Aristotle remarked that such work ofdirect creation would be quite unbecoming to God -- [[aprepes toi theo]]. Plato and other philosophers taught the same:deity cannot set its own hand to creation, -- [[autournein hapanta]]. This Cudworth calls \"Hylozoism.\" As old Zeno iscredited by Laertius with having said, \"Nature is a habit moved from itself, according to seminal principles; perfecting andcontaining those several things which in determinate times are produced from it, and acting agreeably to that from whichit was secreted.\"*Let us return to our subject, pausing to think over it. Indeed, if there was vegetable life during those periods that couldfeed on the then deleterious elements; and if there was even animal life whose aquatic organization could be developed,notwithstanding the supposed scarcity of Oxygen, why could there not be human life also, in its incipient physical form,i.e., in a race of beings adapted for that geological period and its surroundings? Besides, science confesses that it knowsnothing of the real length of \"geological periods.\"But the chief question before us is, whether it is quite certain that, from the time of that which is called the \"Azoic\" age,there ever was such an atmosphere as that hypothesised by the Naturalists. Not all the physicists agree with this idea.Were the writer anxious to corroborate the teachings of the Secret Doctrine by exact science, it would be easy to show,on the admission of more than one physicist, that the atmosphere has changed little, if at all, since the first condensationof the oceans -- i.e., since the Laurentian period, the Pyrolithic age. Such, at any rate, is the opinion of Blanchard, S.Meunier, and even of Bischof -- as the experiments of the latter scientist with basalts have shown. For were we to takethe word of the majority of scientists as to the quantity of deadly gases, and of elements entirely saturated with carbonand nitrogen, in which the vegetable and animal kingdoms are shown to have lived, thriven, and developed, then onewould have to come to the curious conclusion that there were, in those days, oceans[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------*Cudworth's \"Intellectual System,\" I. p. 328.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 160 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of liquid carbonic acid, instead of water. With such an element, it becomes doubtful whether the Ganoids, or even thePrimitive Trilobites themselves could live in the oceans of the primary age -- let alone in those of the Silurian, as shown byBlanchard.The conditions that were necessary for the earliest race of mankind, however, require no elements, whether simple orcompound. That which was stated at the beginning is maintained. The spiritual ethereal Entity which lived in Spacesunknown to Earth, before the first sidereal \"jelly-speck\" evolved in the ocean of crude Cosmic Matter, -- billions andtrillions of years before our globular speck in infinity, called Earth, came into being and generated the Moneron in itsdrops, called Oceans -- needed no \"elements.\" The \"Manu with soft bones\" could well dispense with calcic phosphate, ashe had no bones, save in a figurative sense. And while even the Monera, however homogeneous their organism, stillrequired physical conditions of life that would help them toward further evolution, the being which became primitive Manand the \"Father of man,\" after evolving on planes of existence undreamt of by science, could well remain impervious toany state of atmospheric conditions around him. The primitive ancestor, in Brasseur de Bourbourg's \"Popul-Vuh,\" who --in the Mexican legends -- could act and live with equal ease under ground and water as upon the Earth, answers only tothe Second and early Third Races in our texts. And if the three kingdoms of Nature were so different in pre-diluvian ages,why should not man have been composed of materials and combinations of atoms now entirely unknown to physicalscience? The plants and animals now known, in almost numberless varieties and species, have all developed, accordingto scientific hypotheses, from primitive and far fewer organic forms. Why should not the same have occurred in the caseof man, the elements, and the rest? \"Universal Genesis starts from the one, breaks into three, then five, and finallyculminates into seven, to return into four, three, and one.\" (Commentary.)For additional proofs consult Part II. of this Volume, \"The Septenary in Nature.\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 161 A SUGGESTIVE STANZA.STANZA VII.FROM THE SEMI-DIVINE DOWN TO THE FIRST HUMAN RACES."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"-------§§ (24) The higher creators reject in their pride the forms evolved by the \"Sons of Yoga.\" (25) They will not incarnate inthe early \"Egg-born.\" . .

But Manas will be relatively fully developed only in the following Round, when it will have an opportunity of becomingentirely divine until the end of the Rounds. As Christian Schoettgen says in Horae Hebraic, etc., the first terrestrial Adam\"had only the breath of life,\" Nephesh, but not the living Soul.(b) Here the inferior Races, of which there are still some analogues left -- as the Australians (now fast dying out) andsome African and Oceanic tribes -- are meant. \"They were not ready\" signifies that the Karmic development of theseMonads had not yet fitted them to occupy the forms of men destined for incarnation in higher intellectual Races. But thisis explained later on.(c) The Zohar speaks of \"Black Fire,\" which is Absolute Light-Wisdom. To those who, prompted by old theologicalprejudice, may say: \"But the Asuras are the rebel Devas, the opponents of the Gods -- hence devils, and the spirits ofEvil,\" it is answered: Esoteric philosophy admits neither good nor evil per se, as existing independently in nature. Thecause for both is found, as regards the Kosmos, in the necessity of contraries or contrasts, and with respect to man, in hishuman nature, his ignorance and passions. There is no devil or the utterly depraved, as there are no Angels absolutelyperfect, though there may be spirits of Light and of Darkness; thus LUCIFER -- the spirit of Intellectual Enlightenment andFreedom of Thought -- is metaphorically the guiding beacon, which helps man to find his way through the rocks andsandbanks of Life, for Lucifer is the LOGOS in his highest, and the \"Adversary\" in his lowest aspect -- both of which arereflected in our Ego. Lactantius, speaking of the Nature of Christ, makes the LOGOS, the Word, the first-born brother ofSatan, the \"first of all creatures.\" (Inst. div. Book II., c. viii., \"Qabbalah,\" 116.)The Vishnu Purana describes these primeval creatures (the Arvaksrota) with crooked digestive canals: They were\"endowed with inward manifestations, but mutually in ignorance about their kind and nature.\" The twenty-eight kinds ofBadha, or imperfections, do not apply, as Wilson thought, to the animals now known and specified by him,* for these didnot exist in those geological periods. This is quite plain in the said work, in which the first created (on this globe) are the\"five-fold immovable creation,\" minerals and vegetables; then come those fabulous animals, Tiryaksrota, (the monsters ofthe abyss slain by the \"Lords,\" see Stanzas II. and III.); then the Urdhwasrotas, the happy celestial beings, which feed onambrosia; then lastly, the Arvaksrotas, human beings -- Brahma's[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Book I., chap. v., p. 71.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 163 CREATORS AND SUB-CREATORS.seventh creation so-called. But these \"creations,\" including the latter, did not occur on this globe, wherever else they mayhave taken place. It is not Brahma who creates things and men on this Earth, but the chief and Lord of the Prajapati, theLords of Being and terrestrial Creation.* Obeying the command of Brahma, Daksha (the synthesis, or the aggregate, ofthe terrestrial creators and progenitors, Pitris included) made superior and inferior (vara and avara) things \"referring toputra\" progeny, and \"bipeds and quadrupeds, and subsequently by his will (the Sons of Will and Yoga) made females,\"i.e., separated the androgynes. Here again, we have \"bipeds\" or men, created before the \"quadrupeds\" as in the esotericteachings. (Vide supra and Stanza XII as explained.)Since, in the exoteric accounts, the Asuras are the first beings created from the \"body of night,\" while the Pitris issue fromthat of Twilight; the \"gods\" being placed by Parasara (Vishnu Purana) between the two, and shown to evolve from the\"body of the day,\" it is easy to discover a determined purpose to veil the order of creation. Man is the Arvaksrota coming"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"from the \"Body of the Dawn\"; and elsewhere, man is again referred to, when the creator of the world, Brahma, is shown\"creating fierce beings, denominated Bhutas and eaters of flesh,\" or as the text has it, \"fiends frightful from being monkey-coloured and carnivorous.\"** Whereas the Rakshasas are generally translated by \"Evil Spirits\" and \"the enemies of thegods,\" which identifies them with the Asuras. In the Ramayana, when Hanuman is reconnoitering the enemy in Lanka, hefinds there Rakshasas, some hideous, \"while some were beautiful to look upon,\" and, in Vishnu Purana, there is a directreference to their becoming the Saviours of \"Humanity,\" or of Brahma.The allegory is very ingenious. Great intellect and too much knowledge are a two-edged weapon in life, and instrumentsfor evil as well as for good. When combined with Selfishness, they will make of the whole of Humanity a footstool for theelevation of him who possesses them, and a means for the attainment of his objects; while, applied to altruistichumanitarian purposes, they may become the means of the salvation of many. At all events, the absence of self-consciousness and intellect will make of man an idiot, a brute in human form. Brahma is Mahat -- the universal Mind --hence the too-selfish among the Rakshasas showing the desire to become possessed of it all -- to \"devour\" Mahat. Theallegory is transparent.At any rate, esoteric philosophy identifies the pre-Brahmanical[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Vishnu Purana,\" Book I., chap. xv. of vol. 2.** Ibid., Book I., chap. v.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 164 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Asuras, Rudras,* Rakshasas and all the \"Adversaries\" of the Gods in the allegories, with the Egos, which, by incarnatingin the still witless man of the Third Race, made him consciously immortal. They are, then, during the cycle of Incarnations,the true dual Logos -- the conflicting and two-faced divine Principle in Man. The Commentary that follows, and the nextStanzas may, no doubt, throw more light on this very difficult tenet, but the writer does not feel competent to give it outfully. Of the succession of Races, however, they say:--\"First come the SELF-EXISTENT on this Earth. They are the 'Spiritual Lives' projected by the absolute WILL and LAW, atthe dawn of every rebirth of the worlds. These LIVES are the divine 'Sishta,' (the seed-Manus, or the Prajapati and thePitris).\"From these proceed --1. The First Race, the \"Self-born,\" which are the (astral) shadows of their Progenitors.** The body was devoid of allunderstanding (mind, intelligence, and will). The inner being (the higher self or Monad), though within the earthly frame,was unconnected with it. The link, the Manas, was not there as yet.2. From the First (race) emanated the second, called the \"Sweat-born\"*** and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Whom Manu calls \"our paternal grandfathers\" (III., 284). The Rudras are the seven manifestations of Rudra-Siva, \"thedestroying god,\" and also the grand Yogi and ascetic.** See § II, §§ 1, Commentary.*** To speak of life as having arisen, and of the human race as having originated, in this absurdly unscientific way, in theface of the modern Pedigrees of Man, is to court instantaneous annihilation. The esoteric doctrine risks the danger,nevertheless, and even goes so far as to ask the impartial reader to compare the above hypothesis (if it is one) withHaeckel's theory -- now fast becoming an axiom with science -- which is quoted verbatim:--\". . . How did life, the living world of organisms, arise? And, secondly, the special question: How did the human raceoriginate? The first of these two inquiries, that as to the first appearance of living beings, can only be decided empirically(! !) by proof of the so-called Archebiosis, or equivocal generation, or the spontaneous production of organisms of thesimplest conceivable kind. Such are the Monera (Protogenes, Protamoeba, etc), exceedingly simple microscopic massesof protoplasm without structure or organisation, which take in nutriment and reproduce themselves by division. Such aMoneron as that primordial organism discovered by the renowned English zoologist Huxley, and named BathybiusHaeckelii, appears as a continuous thick protoplasmic covering at the greatest depths of the ocean, between 3,000 and30,000 feet. It is true that the first appearance of such Monera has not up to the present moment been actually observed;but there is nothing intrinsically improbable in such an evolution.\" (The \"Pedigree of Man,\" Aveling's translation, p 33.)The Bathybius protoplasm having recently turned out to be no organic substance at all, there remains little to be said.Nor, after reading this, does one need to consume further time in refuting the further assertion that . . . . \"in that case manalso [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 165 TO THE MONERON THE CREATOR.the \"Boneless.\" This is the Second Root-Race, endowed by the preservers (Rakshasas)* and the incarnating gods(Asuras and the Kumaras) with the first primitive and weak spark (the germ of intelligence) . .

The first Races hereof are shells, till the last is \"inhabited\" (i.e.,informed) by the Dhyanis.The Second Race, as stated above, being also sexless, evolved out of itself, at its beginning, the Third Androgyne Raceby an analogous, but already more complicated process. As described in the Commentary, the very earliest of that racewere:--\"The 'Sons of Passive Yoga.* They issued from the second Manushyas[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] has beyond a doubt (to the minds of Haeckel and his like) arisen from thelower mammalia, apes and the earlier simian creatures, the still earlier Marsupialia, Amphibia, Pisces, by progressivetransformations,\" all produced by \"a series of natural forces working blindly. . . . . . . . . aim, without design\" (p. 36).The above-quoted passage bears its criticism on its own face. Science is made to teach that which, up to the presenttime, \"has never been actually observed.\" She is made to deny the phenomenon of an intelligent nature and a vital forceindependent of form and matter, and to find it more scientific to teach the miraculous performance of \"natural forcesworking blindly without aim or design.\" If so, then we are led to think that the physico-mechanical forces of the brains ofcertain eminent Scientists are leading them on as blindly to sacrifice logic and common sense on the altar of mutualadmiration. Why should the protoplasmic Moneron producing the first living creature through self-division be held as avery scientific hypothesis, and an ethereal pre-human race generating the primeval men in the same fashion be tabooedas unscientific superstition? Or has materialism obtained a sole monopoly in Science?* The Rakshasas, regarded in Indian popular theology as demons, are called the \"Preservers\" beyond the Himalayas.This double and contradictory meaning has its origin in a philosophical allegory, which is variously rendered in thePuranas. It is stated that when Brahma created the demons, Yakshas (from Yaksh, to eat) and the Rakshasas, both ofwhich kinds of demons, as soon as born, wished to devour their creator, those among them that called out \"Not so! oh, lethim be saved (preserved)\" were named Rakshasas (Vishnu Purana Book I. ch. v.). The Bhagavata Purana (III, 20, 19-21)renders the allegory differently. Brahma transformed himself into night (or ignorance) invested with a body, upon whichthe Yakshas and Rakshasas seized, exclaiming \"Do not spare it; devour it.\" Brahma then cried out, \"Do not devour me,spare me.\" This has an inner meaning of course. The \"body of Night\" is the darkness of ignorance, and it is the darknessof silence and secrecy. Now the Rakshasas are shown in almost every case to be Yogis, pious Saddhus and Initiates, arather unusual occupation for demons. The meaning then is that while we have power to dispel the darkness ofignorance, \"devour it,\" we have to preserve the sacred truth from profanation. \"Brahma is for the Brahmins alone,\" saysthat proud caste. The moral of the fable is evident.** The gradual evolution of man in the Secret Doctrine shows that all the later (to the profane the earliest) Races havetheir physical origin in the early Fourth Race. But it is the sub-race, which preceded the one that separated sexually, thatis to be [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 166 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(human race), and became oviparous. The emanations that came out of their bodies during the seasons of procreationwere ovulary; the small spheroidal nuclei developing into a large soft, egg-like vehicle, gradually hardened, when, after aperiod of gestation, it broke and the young human animal issued from it unaided, as the fowls do in our race.\"This must seem to the reader ludicrously absurd. Nevertheless, it is strictly on the lines of evolutionary analogy, whichscience perceives in the development of the living animal species. First the moneron-like procreation by self-division (videHaeckel); then, after a few stages, the oviparous, as in the case of the reptiles, which are followed by the birds; then,finally, the mammals with their ovoviviparous modes of producing their young ones.If the term ovoviviparous is applied to some fish and reptiles, which hatch their eggs within their bodies, why should it notbe applied to female mammalians, including woman? The ovule, in which, after impregnation, the development of thefoetus takes place, is an egg.At all events, this conception is more philosophical than that of Eve with a suddenly created placenta giving birth to Cain,because of the Apple, when even the marsupial, the earliest of mammals, is not placental yet.Moreover, the progressive order of the methods of reproduction, as unveiled by science, is a brilliant confirmation ofesoteric Ethnology. It is only necessary to tabulate the data in order to prove our assertion.

Second and early Third Root-Races.)V. True sexual union:--(Cf. later Third Root-Race.)We now come to an important point with regard to the double evolution of the human race. The Sons of Wisdom, or thespiritual Dhyanis, had become \"intellectual\" through their contact with matter, because they had already reached, duringprevious cycles of incarnation, that degree of intellect which enabled them to become independent and self-consciousentities, on this plane of matter. They were reborn only by reason of Karmic effects. They entered those who were\"ready,\" and became the Arhats, or sages, alluded to above. This needs explanation.It does not mean that Monads entered forms in which other Monads already were. They were \"Essences,\" \"Intelligences,\"and conscious spirits; entities seeking to become still more conscious by uniting with more developed matter. Theiressence was too pure to be distinct from the universal essence; but their \"Egos,\" or Manas (since they are calledManasaputra, born of \"Mahat,\" or Brahma) had to pass through earthly human experiences to become all-wise, and beable to start on the returning ascending cycle. The Monads are not discrete principles, limited or conditioned, but raysfrom that one universal absolute Principle. The entrance into a dark room through the same aperture of one ray ofsunlight following another will not constitute two rays, but one ray intensified. It is not in the course of natural law that manshould become a perfect septenary being, before the seventh race in the seventh Round. Yet he has all these principleslatent in him from his birth. Nor is it part of the evolutionary law that the Fifth principle (Manas), should receive itscomplete development before the Fifth Round. All such prematurely developed intellects (on the spiritual plane) in ourRace are abnormal; they are those whom we call the \"Fifth-Rounders.\" Even in the coming seventh Race, at the close ofthis Fourth Round, while our four lower principles will be fully developed, that of Manas will be only proportionately so.This limitation, however, refers solely to the spiritual development. The intellectual, on the physical plane, was reachedduring the Fourth Root-Race. Thus, those who were \"half ready,\" who received \"but a spark,\" constitute the averagehumanity which has to acquire its intellectuality during the present Manvantaric evolution,------------------------------------------------------------------------ [[Vol. 2, Page]] 168 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.after which they will be ready in the next for the full reception of the \"Sons of Wisdom.\" While those which \"were notready\" at all, the latest Monads, which had hardly evolved from their last transitional and lower animal forms at the closeof the Third Round, remained the \"narrow-brained\" of the Stanza. This explains the otherwise unaccountable degrees ofintellectuality among the various races of men -- the savage Bushman and the European -- even now. Those tribes ofsavages, whose reasoning powers are very little above the level of the animals, are not the unjustly disinherited, or theunfavoured, as some may think -- nothing of the kind. They are simply those latest arrivals among the human Monads,which were not ready: which have to evolve during the present Round, as on the three remaining globes (hence on fourdifferent planes of being) so as to arrive at the level of the average class when they reach the Fifth Round. One remarkmay prove useful, as food for thought to the student in this connection. The MONADS of the lowest specimens ofhumanity (the \"narrow-brained\"* savage South-Sea Islander, the African, the Australian) had no Karma to work out whenfirst born as men, as their more favoured brethren in intelligence had. The former are spinning out Karma only now; thelatter are burdened with past, present, and future Karma. In this respect the poor savage is more fortunate than thegreatest genius of civilised countries.Let us pause before giving any more such strange teachings. Let us try and find out how far any ancient Scriptures, andeven Science, permit the possibility of, or even distinctly corroborate, such wild notions as are found in ourAnthropogenesis.Recapitulating that which has been said we find:-- That the Secret Doctrine claims for man, (1) a polygenetic origin. (2) Avariety of modes of procreation before humanity fell into the ordinary method of generation. (3) That the evolution ofanimals -- of the mammalians at any rate -- follows that of man instead of preceding it. And this is diametrically opposedto the now generally accepted theories of evolution and the descent of man from an animal ancestor.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The term here means neither the dolicho-cephalic nor the brachyo-cephalic, nor yet skulls of a smaller volume, butsimply brains devoid of intellect generally. The theory which would judge of the intellectual capacity of a man according tohis cranial capacity, seems absurdly illogical to one who has studied the subject. The skulls of the stone period, as wellas those of African Races (Bushmen included) show that the first are above rather than below the average of the braincapacity of the modern man, and the skulls of the last are on the whole (as in the case of Papuans and Polynesians"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"generally) larger by one cubic inch than that of the average Frenchman. Again, the cranial capacity of the Parisian of to-day represents an average of 1437 cubic centimetres compared to 1523 of the Auvergnat.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 169 MONOGENISM OR POLYGENISM.Let us, by giving to Caesar what is Caesar's, examine, first of all, the chances for the polygenetic theory among the menof science.Now the majority of the Darwinian evolutionists incline to a polygenetic explanation of the origin of Races. On thisparticular question, however, scientists are, as in many other cases, at sixes and sevens; they agree to disagree.\"Does man descend from one single couple or from several groups -- monogenism or polygenism? As far as one canventure to pronounce on what in the absence of witnesses (?) will never be known (?), the second hypothesis is far themost probable.\"* Abel Hovelacque, in his \"Science of Language,\" comes to a similar conclusion, arguing from theevidence available to a linguistic enquirer.In an address delivered before the British Association, Professor W. H. Flower remarked on this question:--\"The view which appears best to accord with what is now known of the characters and distribution of the races of man . . .. is a modification of the monogenistic hypothesis (!). Without entering into the difficult question of the method of man'sfirst appearance upon the world, we must assume for it a vast antiquity, at all events as measured by any historicalstandard. If we had any approach to a complete palaeontological record, the history of Man could be re-constructed, butnothing of the kind is forthcoming.\"Such an admission must be regarded as fatal to the dogmatism of the physical Evolutionists, and as opening a widemargin to occult speculations. The opponents of the Darwinian theory were, and still remain, polygenists. Such\"intellectual giants\" as John Crawford and James Hunt discussed the problem and favoured polygenesis, and in their daythere was a far stronger feeling in favour of than against this theory. It is only in 1864 that Darwinians began to bewedded to the theory of unity, of which Messrs. Huxley and Lubbock became the first coryphai.As regards that other question, of the priority of man to the animals in the order of evolution, the answer is as promptlygiven. If man is really the Microcosm of the Macrocosm, then the teaching has nothing so very impossible in it, and is butlogical. For, man becomes that Macrocosm for the three lower kingdoms under him. Arguing from a physical standpoint,all the lower kingdoms, save the mineral -- which is light itself, crystallised and immetallised -- from plants to the creatureswhich preceded the first mammalians, all have been consolidated in their physical structures by means of the \"cast-offdust\" of those minerals, and the refuse of the human matter, whether from living or dead[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* A. Lefevre, \"Philosophy,\" p. 498.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 170 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.bodies, on which they fed and which gave them their outer bodies. In his turn, man grew more physical, by re-absorbinginto his system that which he had given out, and which became transformed in the living animal crucibles through which ithad passed, owing to Nature's alchemical transmutations. There were animals in those days of which our modernnaturalists have never dreamed; and the stronger became physical material man, the giants of those times, the morepowerful were his emanations. Once that Androgyne \"humanity\" separated into sexes, transformed by Nature into child-bearing engines, it ceased to procreate its like through drops of vital energy oozing out of the body. But while man wasstill ignorant of his procreative powers on the human plane, (before his Fall, as a believer in Adam would say,) all this vitalenergy, scattered far and wide from him, was used by Nature for the production of the first mammal-animal forms.Evolution is an eternal cycle of becoming, we are taught; and nature never leaves an atom unused. Moreover, from thebeginning of the Round, all in Nature tends to become Man. All the impulses of the dual, centripetal and centrifugal Forceare directed towards one point -- MAN. The progress in the succession of beings, says Agassiz, \"consists in anincreasing similarity of the living fauna, and, among the vertebrates, especially, in the increasing resemblance to man.Man is the end towards which all animal creation has tended from the first appearance of the first palaeozoic fishes.\"*Just so; but \"the palaeozoic fishes\" being at the lower curve of the arc of the evolution of forms, this Round began withastral man, the reflection of the Dhyan Chohans, called the \"Builders.\" Man is the alpha and the omega of objectivecreation. As said in \"Isis Unveiled,\" \"all things had their origin in spirit -- evolution having originally begun from above andproceeding downwards, instead of the reverse, as taught in the Darwinian theory.\"** Therefore, the tendency spoken ofby the eminent naturalist above quoted, is one inherent in every atom. Only, were one to apply it to both sides of theevolution, the observations made would greatly interfere with the modern theory, which has now almost become(Darwinian) law.But in citing the passage from Agassiz' work with approval, it must not be understood that the occultists are making anyconcession to the theory, which derives man from the animal kingdom. The fact that in this Round he preceded themammalia is obviously not impugned by the consideration that the latter (mammalia) follow in the wake of man.-------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Principles of Zoology,\" p. 206.** Vol. I, p. 154."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 171 A SUGGESTIVE EXPLANATION.25.

Vogt, again, holds that in America Man sprang from a branch of the platyrrhine apes, independentlyof the origination of the African and Asian root-stocks from the old world catarrhinians. Anthropologists are, as usual, atloggerheads on this question, as on many others. We shall examine this claim in the light of esoteric philosophy in StanzaVIII. Meanwhile, let us give a few moments of attention to the various consecutive modes of procreation according to thelaws of Evolution.Let us begin by the mode of reproduction of the later sub-races of the Third human race, by those who found themselvesendowed with the sacred fire from the spark of higher and then independent Beings, who were the psychic and spiritualparents of Man, as the lower Pitar Devata (the Pitris) were the progenitors of his physical body. That Third and holy Raceconsisted of men who, at their zenith, were described[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This is explained in the section which follows this series of Stanzas in the allegory from the Puranas concerning Kandu,the holy sage, and Pramlocha, the nymph alleged to have hypnotised him, (Vide § Il., Commentary after St.I.), asuggestive allegory, scientifically, as the drops of perspiration, which she exuded, are the symbols of the spores ofscience (Vide infra).** This will be explained as we proceed. This unwillingness to fashion men, or create, is symbolized in the Puranas byDaksha having to deal with his opponent Narada, the \"strife-making ascetic.\"*** Vide Verse 24.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 172 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.as, \"towering giants of godly strength and beauty, and the depositories of all the mysteries of Heaven and Earth.\" Havethey likewise fallen, if, then, incarnation was the Fall?Of this presently. The only thing now to be noted of these is, that the chief gods and heroes of the Fourth and FifthRaces, as of later antiquity, are the deified images of these men of the Third. The days of their physiological purity, andthose of their so-called Fall, have equally survived in the hearts and memories of their descendants. Hence, the dualnature shown in those gods, both virtue and sin being exalted to their highest degree, in the biographies composed byposterity. They were the pre-Adamite and the divine Races, with which even theology, in whose sight they are all \"theaccursed Cainite Races,\" now begins to busy itself.But the action of \"spiritual progenitors\" of that Race has first to be disposed of. A very difficult and abstruse point has tobe explained with regard to Stanzas 26 and 27. These say:---------26. WHEN THE SWEAT-BORN PRODUCED THE EGG-BORN, THE TWO-FOLD (androgyne Third Race*), THEMIGHTY, THE POWERFUL WITH BONES, THE LORDS OF WISDOM SAID: \"NOW SHALL WE CREATE\" (a).Why \"now\" -- and not earlier?

(Cf., his \"Doctrine of Descent and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Darwinism,\" p. 159.) Apart from such palpable traces of a primeval hermaphroditism, the fact may be noted that, as Laingwrites, \"a study of embryology. . . . shows that in the human higher animal species the distinction of sex is not developeduntil a considerable progress has been made in the growth of the embryo.\" (\"A Modern Zoroastrian,\" p.106.) The Law ofRetardation -- operative alike in the case of human races, animal species, etc., when a higher type has once beenevolved -- still preserves hermaphroditism as the reproductive method of the majority of plants and many lower animals.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 173 THE SONS OF KRIYASAKTI.Kumaras of the Hindu Pantheon and Puranas, those elder sons of Brahma, \"Sanandana and the other sons of Vedhas,\"who, previously created by him \"without desire or passion, remained chaste, full of holy wisdom and undesirous ofprogeny?\"*The power, by which they first created, is just that which has since caused them to be degraded from their high status tothe position of evil spirits, of Satan and his Host, created in their turn by the unclean fancy of exoteric creeds. It was byKriyasakti, that mysterious and divine power latent in the will of every man, and which, if not called to life, quickened anddeveloped by Yogi-training, remains dormant in 999,999 men out of a million, and gets atrophied. This power is explainedin the \"Twelve Signs of the Zodiac,\"** as follows:--(b) \"Kriyasakti -- the mysterious power of thought which enables it to produce external, perceptible, phenomenal resultsby its own inherent energy. The ancients held that any idea will manifest itself externally, if one's attention (and Will) isdeeply concentrated upon it; similarly, an intense volition will be followed by the desired result. A Yogi generally performshis wonders by means of Itchasakti (Will-power) and Kriyasakti.\"The Third Race had thus created the so-called SONS OF WILL AND YOGA, or the \"ancestors\" (the spiritual forefathers)of all the subsequent and present Arhats, or Mahatmas, in a truly immaculate way. They were indeed created, notbegotten, as were their brethren of the Fourth Race, who were generated sexually after the separation of sexes, the Fallof Man. For creation is but the result of will acting on phenomenal matter, the calling forth out of it the primordial divineLight and eternal Life. They were the \"holy seed-grain\" of the future Saviours of Humanity.Here we have to make again a break, in order to explain certain difficult points, of which there are so many. It is almostimpossible to avoid such interruptions. For explanations and a philosophical account of the nature of those beings, whichare now viewed as the \"Evil\" and rebellious Spirits, the creators by Kriyasakti, the reader is referred to the chapters on\"The Fallen Angels\" and \"The Mystic Dragons,\" in Part II. of this Volume.The order of the evolution of the human Races stands thus in the Fifth Book of the Commentaries, and was alreadygiven:--The First men were Chhayas (1); the second, the \"Sweat-born\" (2), the Third, \"Egg-born,\" and the holy Fathers born bythe power of Kriyasakti (3); the Fourth were the children of the Padmapani (Chenresi) (4).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Vishnu Purana,\" Book I., ch. 7, para. 1.** See \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" p. 777.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 174 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Of course such primeval modes of procreation -- by the evolution of one's image, through drops of perspiration, after thatby Yoga, and then by what people will regard as magic (Kriyasakti) -- are doomed beforehand to be regarded as fairy-tales. Nevertheless, beginning with the first and ending with the last, there is really nothing miraculous in them, noranything which could not be shown natural. This must be proven.1. Chhaya-birth, or that primeval mode of sexless procreation, the first Race having oozed out, so to say, from the bodiesof the Pitris, is hinted at in a Cosmic allegory in the Puranas.* It is the beautiful allegory and story of Sanjna, the daughterof Viswakarman -- married to the Sun, who, \"unable to endure the fervours of her lord,\" gave him her chhaya (shadow,image, or astral body), while she herself repaired to the jungle to perform religious devotions, or Tapas. The Sun,supposing the \"chhaya\" to be his wife begat by her children, like Adam with Lilith -- an ethereal shadow also, as in thelegend, though an actual living female monster millions of years ago.But, perhaps, this instance proves little except the exuberant fancy of the Puranic authors. We have another proof ready.If the materialised forms, which are sometimes seen oozing out of the bodies of certain mediums could, instead ofvanishing, be fixed and made solid -- the creation of the first Race would become quite comprehensible. This kind ofprocreation cannot fail to be suggestive to the student. Neither the mystery nor the impossibility of such a mode iscertainly any greater -- while it is far more comprehensible to the mind of the true metaphysical thinker - than the mysteryof the conception of the foetus, its gestation and birth as a child, as we now know it.Now to the curious and little understood corroboration in the Puranas about the \"Sweat-born.\"2. Kandu is a sage and a Yogi, eminent in holy wisdom and pious austerities, which, finally, awaken the jealousy of thegods, who are represented in the Hindu Scriptures as being in never-ending strife with the ascetics. Indra, the \"King of theGods,\"** finally sends one of his female Apsarasas to tempt the sage. This is no worse than Jehovah sending Sarah,Abraham's wife, to tempt Pharaoh; but in truth it is those gods (and god), who are ever trying to disturb ascetics and thusmake them lose the fruit of their austerities, who ought to be regarded as \"tempting demons,\" instead of applying the termto the Rudras, Kumaras, and Asuras, whose great sanctity and chastity seem a standing reproach to the Don Juanic godsof the Pantheon. But it is"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide \"Vishnu-Purana,\" Book III., chap. 2.** In the oldest MS. of \"Vishnu-Purana\" in the possession of an Initiate in Southern India, the god is not Indra, but Kama,the god of love and desire.

She succeeds in her unholy purpose and \"907 years six months and three days\"* spent in her company seemto the sage as one day. When this psychological or hypnotic state ends, the Muni curses bitterly the creature whoseduced him, thus disturbing his devotions. \"Depart, begone!\" he cries, \"vile bundle of illusions!\" . . . And Pramlocha,terrified, flies away, wiping the perspiration from her body with the leaves of the trees as she passes through the air. Shewent from tree to tree, and as, with the dusky shoots that crowned their summits, she dried her limbs, the child she hadconceived by the Rishi came forth from the pores of her skin in drops of perspiration. The trees received the living dews;and the winds collected them into one mass. \"This,\" said Soma (the Moon), \"I matured by my rays; and gradually itincreased in size, till the exhalation that had rested on the tree tops became the lovely girl named Marisha.\"**Now Kandu stands here for the First Race. He is a son of the Pitris, hence one devoid of mind, which is hinted at by hisbeing unable to discern a period of nearly one thousand years from one day; therefore he is shown to be so easilydeluded and blinded. Here is a variant of the allegory in Genesis, of Adam, born an image of clay, into which the \"Lord-god\" breathes the breath of life but not of intellect and discrimination, which are developed only after he had tasted of thefruit of the Tree of Knowledge; in other words when he has acquired the first development of Mind, and had implanted inhim Manas, whose terrestrial aspect is of the Earth earthy, though its highest faculties connect it with Spirit and the divineSoul. Pramlocha is the Hindu Lilith of the Aryan Adam; and Marisha, the daughter born of the perspiration from her pores,is the \"sweat-born,\" and stands as a symbol for the Second Race of Mankind.As remarked in the foot note (vide supra) it is not Indra, who now figures in the Puranas, but Kamadeva, the god of loveand desire, who sends Pramlocha on Earth. Logic, besides the esoteric doctrine, shows that it must be so. For Kama isthe king and lord of the Apsarasas, of whom Pramlocha is one; and, therefore, when Kandu, in cursing her,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* These are the exoteric figures given in a purposely reversed and distorted way, being the figure of the duration of thecycle between the first and second human race. All Orientalists to the contrary, there is not a word in any of the Puranasthat has not a special esoteric meaning.** \"Vishnu Purana,\" Book I., ch. 15. Cf. also Vivien's temptation of Merlin (Tennyson), the same legend in Irish tradition.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 176 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.exclaims \"Thou hast performed the office assigned by the monarch of the gods, go!\" he must mean by that monarchKama and not Indra, to whom the Apsarasas are not subservient. For Kama, again, is in the Rig Veda (x. 129) thepersonification of that feeling which leads and propels to creation. He was the first movement that stirred the ONE, afterits manifestation from the purely abstract principle, to create, \"Desire first arose in It, which was the primal germ of mind;and which sages, searching with their intellect, have discovered to be the bond which connects Entity with Non-Entity.\" Ahymn in the Atharva Veda exalts Kama into a supreme God and Creator, and says: \"Kama was born the first. Him,neither gods nor fathers (Pitara) nor men have equalled.\" . . . . The Atharva Veda identifies him with Agni, but makes himsuperior to that god. The Taittariya Brahmana makes him allegorically the son of Dharma (moral religious duty, piety andjustice) and of Sraddha (faith). Elsewhere Kama is born from the heart of Brahma; therefore he is Atma-Bhu \"Self-Existent,\" and Aja, the \"unborn.\" His sending Promlocha has a deep philosophical meaning; sent by Indra -- the narrativehas none. As Eros was connected in early Greek mythology with the world's creation, and only afterwards became thesexual Cupid, so was Kama in his original Vedic character, (Harivansa making him a son of Lakshmi, who is Venus). Theallegory, as said, shows the psychic element developing the physiological, before the birth of Daksha, the progenitor ofreal physical men, made to be born from Marisha and before whose time living beings and men were procreated \"by thewill, by sight, by touch and by Yoga,\" as will be shown.This, then, is the allegory built on the mode of procreation of the Second or the \"Sweat-born.\" The same for the ThirdRace in its final development.Marisha, through the exertions of Soma, the Moon, is taken to wife by the Prachetasas, the production of the \"Mind-born\"sons of Brahma also*, from whom they beget the Patriarch Daksha, a son of Brahma[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The text has:-- \"From Brahma were born mind-engendered progeny, with forms and faculties derived from his corporealnature, embodied spirits produced from the limbs (gatra) of Dhimat (all-wise deity). These beings were the abode of thethree qualities of deva-sarga (divine creation, which, as the five-fold creation, is devoid of clearness of perception, withoutreflection, dull of nature). But as they did not multiply themselves, Brahma created \"other mind-born sons like himself,\"namely, the Brahma-rishis, or the Prajapati (ten and seven). Sanandana and the other sons of Vedhas (Brahma) werepreviously created, but, as shown elsewhere, they were \"without desire or passion, inspired with holy wisdom, estrangedfrom the universe and undesirous of progeny\" (Book I, ch. 7). These Sanandana and other Kumaras are then the Gods,"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"who after refusing to \"create progeny\" are forced to incarnate in senseless men.

The early Third Race, then, is formed from drops of \"sweat,\" which, after many a transformation, grow into humanbodies. This is not more difficult to imagine or realise than the growth of the foetus from an imperceptible germ, whichfoetus develops into a child, and then into a strong, heavy man. But this race again changes its mode of procreationaccording to the Commentaries. It is said to have emanated a vis formativa, which changed the drops of perspiration intogreater drops, which grew, expanded, and became ovoid bodies -- huge eggs. In these the human foetus gestated forseveral years. In the Puranas, Marisha, the daughter of Kandu, the sage, becomes the wife of the Prachetasas and themother of Daksha. Now Daksha is the father of the first human-like progenitors, having been born in this way. He ismentioned later on. The evolution of man, the microcosm, is analogous to that of the Universe, the macrocosm. Hisevolution stands between that of the latter and that of the animal, for which man, in his turn, is a macrocosm.Then the race becomes:--(4.) The androgyne, or hermaphrodite. This process of men-bearing explains, perhaps, why Aristophanes* describes thenature of the old race as androgynous, the form of every individual being rounded, \"having the back and sides as in acircle,\" whose \"manner of running was circular . . . . terrible in force and strength and with prodigious ambition.\"Therefore, to make them weaker, \"Zeus divided them (in the Third Root-Race) into two, and Apollo (the Sun), under hisdirection, closed up the skin.\" The Madagascans (the island belonged to Lemuria) have a tradition about the first man,who lived at first without eating, and, having indulged in food, a swelling appeared in his leg; this bursting, there emergedfrom it a female, who became the mother of their race. Truly . . . \"We have our sciences of Heterogenesis andParthenogenesis, showing that the field is yet open. . . . . The polyps . . . . produce their offspring from themselves, likethe buds and ramifications of a tree. . . . \" Why not the primitive human polyp? The very interesting polyp Stauridiumpasses alternately from gemmation into the sex method of reproduction. Curiously enough, though it grows merely as apolyp on a stalk, it produces gemmules, which ultimately develop into a sea-nettle or Medusa. The Medusa is utterlydissimilar to its parent-organism, the Stauridium. It also reproduces itself differently, by sexual method, and from theresulting eggs Stauridia once more put in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Plato's \"Banquet.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 178 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.an appearance. This striking fact may assist many to understand that a form may be evolved -- as in the sexualLemurians from Hermaphrodite parentage -- quite unlike its immediate progenitors. It is, moreover, unquestionable that inthe case of human incarnations the law of Karma, racial or individual, overrides the subordinate tendencies of \"Heredity,\"its servant.The meaning of the last sentence in the above-quoted Commentary on Stanza 27, namely, that the Fourth Race were thechildren of Padmapani, may find its explanation in a certain letter from the Inspirer of \"Esoteric Buddhism\" quoted on p.68. \"The majority of mankind belongs to the seventh sub-race of the Fourth Root-Race -- the above-mentioned Chinamenand their off-shoots and branchlets. (Malayans, Mongolians, Tibetans, Hungarians, Finns, and even the Esquimaux areall remnants of this last offshoot.)\"Padmapani, or Avalokiteswara in Sanskrit, is, in Tibetan, Chenresi. Now, Avalokiteswara is the great Logos in its higheraspect and in the divine regions. But in the manifested planes, he is, like Daksha, the progenitor (in a spiritual sense) ofmen. Padmapani-Avalokiteswara is called esoterically Bhodhisatva (or Dhyan Chohan) Chenresi Vanchug, \"the powerfuland all-seeing.\" He is considered now as the greatest protector of Asia in general, and of Tibet in particular. In order toguide the Tibetans and Lamas in holiness, and preserve the great Arhats in the world, this heavenly Being is credited withmanifesting himself from age to age in human form. A popular legend has it that whenever faith begins to die out in theworld, Padmapani Chenresi, the \"lotus-bearer,\" emits a brilliant ray of light, and forthwith incarnates himself in one of thetwo great Lamas -- the Dalai and Teschu Lamas; finally, it is believed that he will incarnate as \"the most perfect Buddha\"in Tibet, instead of in India, where his predecessors, the great Rishis and Manus had appeared in the beginning of ourRace, but now appear no longer. Even the exoteric appearance of Dhyani Chenresi is suggestive of the esotericteaching. He is evidently, like Daksha, the synthesis of all the preceding Races and the progenitor of all the human Racesafter the Third, the first complete one, and thus is represented as the culmination of the four primeval races in his eleven-faced form. It is a column built in four rows, each series having three faces or heads of different complexions: the threefaces for each race being typical of its three fundamental physiological transformations. The first is white (moon-coloured); the second is yellow; the third, red-brown; the fourth, in which are only two faces -- the third face being left ablank -- (a reference to the untimely end of the Atlanteans) is brown-black. Padmapani (Daksha) is seated on the column,and forms the apex. In this reference------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 179 THE BIRTH-DAYS OF THE DHYANIS.compare Stanza 39. The Dhyan Chohan is represented with four arms, another allusion to the four races. For while twoare folded, the third hand holds a lotus (Padmapani, \"the lotus-bearer\"), this flower symbolizing generation, and the fourthholds a serpent, emblem of the Wisdom in his power. On his neck is a rosary, and on his head the sign of water[[diagram]] -- matter, deluge -- while on his brow rests the third eye (Siva's eye, that of spiritual insight). His name is\"Protector\" (of Tibet), \"Saviour of Humanity.\" On other occasions when he has only two arms, he is Chenresi, the Dhyani"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"and Bhodisatva, Chakna-padmakarpo, \"he who holds a lotus.\" His other name is Chantong, \"he of the 1,000 eyes,\" whenhe is endowed with a thousand arms and hands, on the palm of each of which is represented an eye of Wisdom, thesearms radiating from his body like a forest of rays. Another of his names is Lokapati and Lokanatha (Sanskrit) \"Lord of theWorld\"; and Jigtengonpo (Tibetan), \"Protector and Saviour against evil\" of any kind.Padmapani, however, is the \"lotus-bearer\" symbolically only for the profane; esoterically, it means the supporter of theKalpas, the last of which, the present Maha-Kalpa (the Varaha), is called Padma, and represents one half of the life ofBrahma. Though a minor Kalpa, it is called Maha, \"great,\" because it comprises the age in which Brahma sprang from alotus. Theoretically, the Kalpas are infinite, but practically they are divided and sub-divided in Space and Time, eachdivision -- down to the smallest -- having its own Dhyani as patron or regent. Padmapani (Avalokiteshwara) becomes, inChina, in his female aspect, Kwan-yin, \"who assumes any form, at pleasure, in order to save mankind.\" The knowledge ofthe astrological aspect of the constellations on the respective \"birth-days\" of these Dhyanis -- Amitabha (the O-mi-to Fo,of China), included: e.g., on the 19th day of the second month, on the 17th day of the eleventh month, and on the 7th dayof the third month, etc., etc. -- gives the Occultist the greatest facilities for performing what are called \"magic\" feats. Thefuture of an individual is seen, with all its coming events marshalled in order, in a magic mirror placed under the ray ofcertain constellations.

FROM THE DROPS OF SWEAT (a); FROM THE RESIDUE OF THE SUBSTANCE; MATTER FROM DEAD BODIESAND ANIMALS OF THE WHEEL BEFORE (previous, Third Round); AND FROM CAST-OFF DUST; THE FIRSTANIMALS (of this Round) WERE PRODUCED.(a) The Occult doctrine maintains that, in this Round, the mammalians were a later work of evolution than man. Evolutionproceeds in cycles. The great Manvantaric cycle of Seven Rounds, beginning in the First Round with mineral, vegetable,and animal, brings its evolutionary work on the descending arc to a dead stop in the middle of the Fourth Race, at theclose of the first half of the Fourth Round. It is on our Earth, then, (the Fourth sphere and the lowest) and in the presentRound, that this middle point has been reached. And since the Monad has passed, after its \"first inmetallization\" on GlobeA, through the mineral, vegetable, and animal worlds in every degree of the three states of matter, except the last degreeof the third or solid state, which it reached only at the \"mid-point of evolution\" it is but logical and natural that at thebeginning of the Fourth Round on Globe D, Man should be the first to appear; and also that his frame should be of themost tenuous matter that is compatible with objectivity. To make it still clearer: if the Monad begins its cycle ofincarnations through the three objective kingdoms on the descending curved line, it has necessarily to enter on the re-ascending curved line of the sphere as a man also. On the descending arc it is the spiritual which is graduallytransformed into the material. On the middle line of the base, Spirit and Matter are equilibrized in Man. On the ascendingarc, Spirit is slowly re-asserting itself at the expense of the physical, or matter, so that, at the close of the seventh Race ofthe Seventh Round, the Monad will find itself as------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 181 MEN, THE PROGENITORS OF ANIMALS.free from matter and all its qualities as it was in the beginning; having gained in addition the experience and wisdom, thefruition of all its personal lives, without their evil and temptations.This order of evolution is found also in Genesis (ch. 1 and 2) if one reads it in its true esoteric sense, for chapter i.contains the history of the first Three Rounds, as well as that of the first Three Races of the Fourth, up to that momentwhen Man is called to conscious life by the Elohim of Wisdom. In the first chapter, animals, whales and fowls of the air,are created before the androgyne Adam.* In the second, Adam (the sexless) comes first, and the animals only appearafter him. Even the state of mental torpor and unconsciousness of the first two races, and of the first half of the ThirdRace, is symbolized, in the second chapter of Genesis, by the deep sleep of Adam. It was the dreamless sleep of mentalinaction, the slumber of the Soul and Mind, which was meant by that \"sleep,\" and not at all the physiological process ofdifferentiation of sexes, as a learned French theorist (M. Naudin) imagined.The Puranas, the Chaldean and Egyptian fragments, and also the Chinese traditions, all show an agreement with theSecret Doctrine as to the process and order of evolution. We find in them the corroboration of almost all our teaching. Forinstance: the statement concerning the oviparous mode of procreation of the Third Race, and even a hint at a lessinnocent mode of the procreation of the first mammal forms, \"gigantic, transparent, dumb and monstrous they were,\" saysthe Commentary. Study the stories of the several Rishis and their multifarious progeny; e.g., Pulastya is the father of allthe Serpents and Nagas -- the oviparous brood; Kasyapa was grandsire, through his wife Tamra, of the birds and ofGaruda, king of the feathered tribe; while by his wife Surabhi, he was the parent of cows and buffaloes, etc., etc.In the Secret Doctrine, the first Nagas -- beings wiser than Serpents -- are the \"Sons of Will and Yoga,\" born before thecomplete separation of the sexes, \"matured in the man-bearing eggs** produced by the power (Kriyasakti) of the holysages\" of the early Third Race.***[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"* An allegorical reference to the \"Sacred Animals\" of the Zodiac and other heavenly bodies.

Otherwise, whence the traditions and legends -- the latter always more true than history, as says AugustinThierry -- and even the identity in the names of certain \"medicine men\" and priests, who exist to this day in Mexico? Weshall have to say something of the Nargals and the Nagals and also of Nagalism, called \"devil-worship\" by theMissionaries.In almost all the Puranas, the story of the \"Sacrifice of Daksha\" is given, the oldest account of which is to be found inVayu Purana. Allegorical as it is, there is more meaning and biological revelation in it to a Naturalist, than in all thepseudo-scientific vagaries, which are regarded as learned theories and hypotheses.Daksha, who is regarded as the Chief Progenitor, is, moreover, pointed out as the creator of physical man in the \"fable,\"which makes him lose his head from his body in the general strife between the gods and the Raumas. This head, beingburnt in the fire, is replaced by the head of a ram (Kasi-Khanda). Now the ram's head and horns are ever the symbol ofgenerating power and of reproductive force, and are phallic. As we have shown, it is Daksha who establishes the era ofmen engendered by sexual intercourse. But this mode of procreation did not occur suddenly, as one may think, andrequired long ages before it became the one \"natural\" way. Therefore, his sacrifice to the gods is shown as interfered withby Siva, the destroying deity, evolution and PROGRESS personified, who is the regenerator at the same time; whodestroys things under one form but to recall them to life under another more perfect type. Siva-Rudra creates the terribleVirabhadra (born of his breath) the \"thousand-headed, thousand-armed\" (etc.) monster, and commissions him to destroythe sacrifice prepared by Daksha. Then Virabhadra, \"abiding in the region of the ghosts (ethereal men) . . . .[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] they are both used indiscriminately.

This allegorical description of the \"sacrifice\" is full of significanceto the students of the Secret Doctrine who know of the \"Sweat-born.\"In the Vayu Purana's account of Daksha's sacrifice, moreover, it is said to have taken place in the presence of creaturesborn from the egg, from the vapour, vegetation, pores of the skin, and, finally only, from the womb.Daksha typifies the early Third Race, holy and pure, still devoid of an individual Ego, and having merely the passivecapacities. Brahma, therefore, commands him to create (in the exoteric texts); when, obeying the command, he made\"inferior and superior\" (avara and vara) progeny (putra), bipeds and quadrupeds; and by his will, gave birth to females . . .. to the gods, the Daityas (giants of the Fourth Race), the snake-gods, animals, cattle and the Danavas (Titans anddemon Magicians) and other beings.\". . . . \"From that period forward, living creatures were engendered by sexual intercourse.

As thisproposition will be maintained and defended elsewhere, a few words more are all that are needed at present. For greaterclearness, however, we shall repeat in brief what was said previously in Book I., Stanza VI.Our teachings show that, while it is quite correct to say that nature had built, at one time, around the human astral form anape-like external shape, yet it is as correct that this shape was no more that of the \"missing link,\" than were the coveringsof that astral form, during the course of its natural evolution through all the kingdoms of nature. Nor was it, as shown inthe proper place, on this Fourth Round planet that such evolution took place, but only during the First, Second, and ThirdRounds, when MAN was, in turn, \"a stone, a plant, and an animal\" until he became what he was in the First Root-Race ofpresent humanity. The real line of evolution differs from the Darwinian, and the two systems are irreconcilable, exceptwhen the latter is divorced from the dogma of \"Natural Selection\" and the like. Indeed, between the Monera of Haeckeland the Sarisripa of Manu, there lies an impassable chasm in the shape of the Jiva; for the \"human\" Monad, whetherimmetallized in the stone-atom, or invegetallized in the plant, or inanimalized in the animal, is still and ever a divine,hence also a HUMAN Monad. It ceases to be human only when it becomes absolutely divine. The terms \"mineral,\"\"vegetable\" and \"animal\" monad are meant to create a superficial distinction: there is no such thing as a Monad (jiva)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 186 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.other than divine, and consequently having been, or having to become, human. And the latter term has to remainmeaningless unless the difference is well understood. The Monad is a drop out of the shoreless Ocean beyond, or, to becorrect, within the plane of primeval differentiation. It is divine in its higher and human in its lower condition -- theadjectives \"higher\" and \"lower\" being used for lack of better words -- and a monad it remains at all times, save in theNirvanic state, under whatever conditions, or whatever external forms. As the Logos reflects the Universe in the DivineMind, and the manifested Universe reflects itself in each of its Monads, as Leibnitz put it, repeating an Eastern teaching,so the MONAD has, during the cycle of its incarnations, to reflect in itself every root-form of each kingdom. Therefore, theKabalists say correctly that \"MAN becomes a stone, a plant, an animal, a man, a Spirit, and finally God. Thusaccomplishing his cycle or circuit and returning to the point from which he had started as the heavenly MAN.\" But by\"Man\" the divine Monad is meant, and not the thinking Entity, much less his physical body. While rejecting the immortalSoul, the men of Science now try to trace the latter through a series of animal forms from the lowest to the highest;whereas, in truth, all the present fauna are the descendants of those primordial monsters of which the Stanzas speak.The animals -- the creeping beasts and those in the waters that preceded man in this Fourth Round, as well as thosecontemporary with the Third Race, and again the mammalia that are posterior to the Third and Fourth Races -- all areeither directly or indirectly the mutual and correlative product (physically) of man. It is correct to say that the man of thisManvantara, i.e., during the three preceding Rounds, has passed through all the kingdoms of nature. That he was \"astone, a plant, an animal.\" But (a) these stones, plants, and animals were the prototypes, the filmy presentments of thoseof the Fourth Round; and (b) even those at the beginning of the Fourth Round were the astral shadows of the present, asthe Occultists express it. And finally the forms and genera of neither man, animal, nor plant were what they became later.Thus the astral prototypes of the lower beings of the animal kingdom of the Fourth Round, which preceded (the chhayasof) Men, were the consolidated, though still very ethereal sheaths of the still more ethereal forms or models produced atthe close of the Third Round on Globe D.* \"Produced from the residue of the substance matter; from dead bodies of menand (other extinct) animals of the wheel before,\" or the previous Third Round -- as Stanza 24 tells us. Hence, while thenondescript \"animals\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide \"Esoteric Buddhism.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 187 THE DARWINISTS MISTAKEN.that preceded the astral man at the beginning of this life-cycle on our Earth were still, so to speak, the progeny of the manof the Third Round, the mammalians of this Round owe their existence, in a great measure, to man again. Moreover, the\"ancestor\" of the present anthropoid animal, the ape, is the direct production of the yet mindless Man, who desecrated hishuman dignity by putting himself physically on the level of an animal.The above accounts for some of the alleged physiological proofs, brought forward by the anthropologists as ademonstration of the descent of man from the animals.The point most insisted upon by the Evolutionists is that, \"The history of the embryo is an epitome of that of the race.\"That \"every organism, in its development from the egg, runs through a series of forms, through which, in like succession,its ancestors have passed in the long course of Earth's history.* The history of the embryo . . . . is a picture in little, andoutline of that of the race. This conception forms the gist of our fundamental biogenetic law, which we are obliged to placeat the head of the study of the fundamental law of organic development.\"**This modern theory was known as a fact to, and far more philosophically expressed by, the Sages and Occultists from theremotest ages. A passage from \"Isis Unveiled\" may here be cited to furnish a few points of comparison. In Vol. I., pp. 388-9, it was asked why, with all their great learning, physiologists were unable to explain teratological phenomena? Anyanatomist who has made the development and growth of the embryo \"a subject of special study,\" can tell, without muchbrain-work, what daily experience and the evidence of his own eyes show him, viz., that up to a certain period, the humanembryo is facsimile of a young batrachian in its first remove from the spawn -- tadpole. But no physiologist or anatomistseems to have had the idea of applying to the development of the human being -- from the first[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"* \"A very strong argument in favour of variability is supplied by the science of Embryology. Is not a man in the uterus . . . .. a simple cell, a vegetable with three or four leaflets, a tadpole with branchiae, a mammal with a tail, lastly a primate (?)and a biped? It is scarcely possible not to recognise in the embryonic evolution a rapid sketch, a faithful summary, of theentire organic series.\" (Lefevre, Philosophy, p. 484).The summary alluded to is, however, only that of the store of types hoarded up in man, the microcosm. This simpleexplanation meets all such objections, as the presence of the rudimentary tail in the foetus -- a fact triumphantly paradedby Haeckel and Darwin as conclusively in favour of the Ape-Ancestor theory. It may also be pointed out that the presenceof a vegetable with leaflets in the embryonic stages is not explained on ordinary evolutionist principles. Darwinists havenot traced man through the vegetable, but Occultists have. Why then this feature in the embryo, and how do the formerexplain it?** \"The Proofs of Evolution,\" a lecture by Haeckel.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 188 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.instant of its physical appearance as a germ to its ultimate formation and birth -- the Pythagorean esoteric doctrine ofmetempsychosis, so erroneously interpreted by critics. The meaning of the axiom: \"A stone becomes a plant; a plant, abeast; a beast, a man, etc.\" was mentioned in another place in relation to the spiritual and physical evolution of men onthis Earth. We will now add a few more words to make the matter clearer.What is the primitive shape of the future man? A grain, a corpuscle, say some physiologists; a molecule, an ovum of theovum, say others. If it could be analysed -- by the microscope or otherwise -- of what ought we to expect to find itcomposed? Analogically, we should say, of a nucleus of inorganic matter, deposited from the circulation at thegerminating point, and united with a deposit of organic matter. In other words, this infinitesimal nucleus of the future manis composed of the same elements as a stone -- of the same elements as the Earth, which the man is destined to inhabit.Moses is cited by the Kabalists as authority for the remark that it required earth and water to make a living being, andthus it may be said that man first appears as a stone.At the end of three or four weeks the ovum has assumed a plant-like appearance, one extremity having becomespheroidal and the other tapering like a carrot. Upon dissection it is found to be composed, like an onion, of very delicatelaminae or coats, enclosing a liquid. The laminae approach each other at the lower end, and the embryo hangs from theroot of the umbilicus almost like the fruit from the bough. The stone has now become changed, by \"metempsychosis,\" intoa plant. Then the embryonic creature begins to shoot out, from the inside outward, its limbs, and develops its features.The eyes are visible as two black dots; the ears, nose, and mouth form depressions, like the points of a pineapple, beforethey begin to project. The embryo develops into an animal-like foetus -- the shape of a tadpole -- and, like an amphibiousreptile, lives in water and develops from it. Its Monad has not yet become either human or immortal, for the Kabalists tellus that this only occurs at the \"fourth hour.\" One by one the foetus assumes the characteristics of the human being, thefirst flutter of the immortal breath passes through its being; it moves; and the divine essence settles in the infant frame,which it will inhabit until the moment of physical death, when man becomes a spirit. This mysterious process of a nine-months' formation, the Kabalists call the completion of the \"individual cycle ofevolution.\" As the foetus develops amidst the liquor amnii in the womb, so the Earths germinate in the universal ether, orastral fluid, in the womb of the Universe. These cosmic children, like their pigmy inhabitants, are at first nuclei; thenovules; then gradually mature; and becoming------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 189 NATURALISTS INVENTING LINKS.mothers, in their turn, develop mineral, vegetable, animal, and human forms. From centre to circumference, from theimperceptible vesicle to the uttermost conceivable bounds of the Kosmos, those glorious thinkers, the Occultists, tracecycle merging into cycle, containing and contained in an endless series. The embryo evolving in its pre-natal sphere, theindividual in his family, the family in the state, the state in mankind, the Earth in our system, that system in its centraluniverse, the universe in the Kosmos, and the Kosmos in the ONE CAUSE . . . thus runs their philosophy of evolution,differing as we see, from that of Haeckel:--\"All are but parts of one stupendous whole,Whose body Nature is, and (Parabrahm) the soul . . .\"These are the proofs of Occultism, and they are rejected by Science. But how is the chasm between the mind of man andanimal to be bridged in this case? How, if the anthropoid and Homo primigenius had, argumenti gratia, a commonancestor (in the way modern speculation puts it), did the two groups diverge so widely from one another as regardsmental capacity? True, the Occultist may be told that in every case Occultism does what Science repeats; it gives acommon ancestor to ape and man, since it makes the former issue from primeval man. Ay, but that \"primeval man\" wasman only in external form. He was mindless and soulless at the time he begot, with a female animal monster, theforefather of a series of apes. This speculation -- if speculation it be -- is at least logical, and fills the chasm between themind of man and animal. Thus it accounts for and explains the hitherto unaccountable and inexplicable. The fact that, inthe present stage of evolution, Science is almost certain that no issue can follow from the union of man and animal, isconsidered and explained elsewhere.Now what is the fundamental difference between the accepted (or nearly so) conclusions, as enunciated in \"The Pedigreeof Man,\" viz., that man and ape have a common ancestor; and the teachings of Occultism, which deny this conclusionand accept the fact that all things and all living beings have originated from one common source? Materialistic sciencemakes man evolve gradually to what he is now, and, starting from the first protoplasmic speck called Moneron (which weare told has, like the rest, \"originated in the course of immeasurable ages from a few, or from one simple, spontaneouslyarising original form, that has obeyed one law of evolution\"), pass through \"unknown and unknowable\" types up to theape, and thence to the human being. Where the transitional shapes are discoverable we are not told; for the simple"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"reason that no \"missing links\" between man and the apes have ever yet been found, though this fact in no way preventsmen like Haeckel from inventing them ad libitum.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 190 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Nor will they ever be met with; simply, again, because that link which unites man with his real ancestry is searched for onthe objective plane and in the material world of forms, whereas it is safely hidden from the microscope and dissectingknife within the animal tabernacle of man himself. We repeat what we have said in Isis Unveiled:--\". . . . . . . All things had their origin in spirit -- evolution having originally begun from above and proceeded downward,instead of the reverse, as taught in the Darwinian theory. In other words, there has been a gradual materialization offorms until a fixed ultimate of debasement is reached. This point is that at which the doctrine of modern evolution entersinto the arena of speculative hypothesis. Arrived at this period we will find it easier to understand Haeckel'sAnthropogeny, which traces the pedigree of man 'from its protoplasmic root, sodden in the mud of seas which existedbefore the oldest of the fossiliferous rocks were deposited,' according to Professor Huxley's exposition. We may believethe man (of the Third Round) evolved 'by gradual modification of an (astral) mammal of ape-like organization' still easierwhen we remember that (though in a more condensed and less elegant, but still as comprehensible, phraseology) thesame theory was said by Berosus to have been taught many thousands of years before his time by the man-fish Oannesor Dagon, the semi-demon of Babylonia* (though on somewhat modified lines).\"But what lies back of the Darwinian line of descent? So far as he is concerned nothing but 'unverifiable hypotheses.' For,as he puts it, he views all beings 'as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of theSilurian system was deposited.'** He does not attempt to show us who these 'few beings' were. But it answers ourpurpose quite as well, for, in the admission of their existence at all, resort to the ancients for corroboration andelaboration of the idea receives the stamp of scientific approbation. . . . \"Truly, as also said in our first work: \"If we accept Darwin's theory of the development of species, we find that his starting-point is placed in front of an open door. We are at liberty with him, to either remain within, or cross the threshold, beyondwhich lies the limitless and the incomprehensible, or rather the Unutterable. If our mortal language is inadequate toexpress what our spirit dimly foresees in the great 'Beyond' -- while on this earth -- it must realize it at some point in thetimeless Eternity.\" But what lies \"beyond\" Haeckel's theory?

Theoutward shape of its first specimens was not uniform, for the vehicles (the egg-like, external shells, in which the futurefully physical man gestated) were often tampered with, before they hardened, by huge animals, of species now unknown,and which belonged to the tentative efforts of Nature. The result was that intermediate races of monsters, half animals,half men, were produced. But as they were failures, they were not allowed to breathe long and live, though theintrinsically paramount power of psychic over physical nature being yet very weak, and hardly established, the 'Egg-Born'Sons had taken several of their females unto themselves as mates, and bred other human monsters. Later, animalspecies and human races becoming gradually equilibrized, they separated and mated no longer. Man created no more --he begot. But he also begot animals, as well as men in days of old. Therefore the Sages (or wise men), who speak ofmales who had no more will-begotten offspring, but begat various animals along with Danavas (giants) on females ofother species -- animals being as (or in a manner of) Sons putative to them; and they (the human males) refusing in timeto be regarded as (putative) fathers of dumb creatures -- spoke truthfully and wisely. Upon seeing this (state of things),the kings and Lords of the Last Races (of the Third and the Fourth) placed the seal of prohibition upon the sinfulintercourse. It interfered with Karma, it developed new (Karma).* They (the divine Kings) struck the culprits with sterility.They destroyed the Red and Blue Races.**In another we find:--\"There were blue and red-faced animal-men even in later times; not from actual intercourse (between the human andanimal species), but by descent.\"And still another passage mentions:--\"Red-haired, swarthy men going on all-fours, who bend and unbend (stand erect and fall on their hands again) who speakas their forefathers, and run on their hands as their giant fore-mothers.\"Perchance in these specimens, Haeckelians might recognize, not the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is next to impossible to translate verbally some of these old Commentaries.

Nevertheless, even theseare not descended from the anthropoid apes, but from human fathers and semi-human mothers, or, to speak morecorrectly, from human monsters -- those \"failures\" mentioned in the first Commentary. The real anthropoids, Haeckel'sCatarrhini and Platyrrhini, came far later, in the closing times of Atlantis. The orang-outang, the gorilla, the chimpanzeeand cynocephalus are the latest and purely physical evolutions from lower anthropoid mammalians. They have a spark ofthe purely human essence in them; man on the other hand, has not one drop of pithecoid* blood in his veins. Thus saithold Wisdom and universal tradition.How was the separation of sexes effected? it is asked. Are we to believe in the old Jewish fable of the rib of Adamyielding Eve? Even such belief is more logical and reasonable than the descent of man from the Quadrumana withoutany reservation; as the former hides an esoteric truth under a fabulous version, while the latter conceals no deeper factthan a desire to force upon mankind a materialistic fiction. The rib is bone, and when we read in Genesis that Eve wasmade out of the rib, it only means that the Race with bones was produced out of a previous Race and Races, which were\"boneless.\" This is an esoteric tenet spread far and wide, as it is almost universal under its various forms. A Tahitiantradition states that man was created out of Araea, \"red[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This, regardless of modern materialistic evolution, which speculates in this wise: \"The primitive human form, whence aswe think all human species sprang, has perished this long time.\" (This we deny; it has only decreased in size andchanged in texture.) \"But many facts point to the conclusion that it was hairy and dolichocephalic.\" (African races areeven now dolichocephalic in a great measure, but the palaeolithic Neanderthal skull, the oldest we know of, is of a largesize, and no nearer to the capacity of the gorilla's cranium than that of any other now-living man). \"Let us, for the timebeing, call this hypothetical species Homo primigenius. . . .

Mr. A. R. Wallace admits its reality, though in a rather modified sense, inhis \"Geographical Distribution of Animals.\" But let not Evolutionists speak so lightly of the comparative size of the brainsof man and the ape, for this is very unscientific, especially when they pretend to see no difference between the two, orvery little at any rate. For Vogt himself showed that, while the highest of the Apes, the gorilla, has a brain of only 30 to 51cubic inches, the brain of the lowest of the Australian aborigines amounts to 99.35 cubic inches. The former is thus \"nothalf of the size of the brain of a new-born babe,\" says Pfaff.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 194 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Earth.\" Taaroa, the creative power, the chief god, \"put man to sleep for long years, for several lives,\" which means racialperiods, and is a reference to his mental sleep, as shown elsewhere. During that time the deity pulled an Ivi (bone) out ofman and she became a woman.*Nevertheless, whatever the allegory may mean, even its exoteric meaning necessitates a divine Builder of man -- \"aProgenitor.\" Do we then believe in such \"supernatural\" beings? We say, No. Occultism has never believed in anything,whether animate or inanimate, outside nature. Nor are we Cosmolators or Polytheists for believing in \"Heavenly Man\" anddivine men, for we have the accumulated testimony of the ages, with its unvarying evidence on every essential point, tosupport us in this; the Wisdom of the Ancients and UNIVERSAL tradition. We reject, however, every groundless andbaseless tradition, which, having outgrown strict allegory and symbolism, has found acceptance in exoteric creeds. Butthat which is preserved in unanimous traditions, only the wilfully blind could reject. Hence we believe in races of beingsother than our own in far remote geological periods; in races of ethereal, following incorporeal, \"Arupa,\" men, with formbut no solid substance, giants who preceded us pigmies; in dynasties of divine beings, those Kings and Instructors of theThird Race in arts and sciences, compared with which our little modern science stands less chance than elementaryarithmetic with geometry.No, certainly not. We do not believe in the supernatural but only in the superhuman, or rather interhuman, intelligences.One may easily appreciate the feeling of reluctance that an educated person would have to being classed with thesuperstitious and ignorant; and even realize the great truth uttered by Renan when he says that: \"The supernatural hasbecome like the original sin, a blemish that every one seems ashamed of -- even those most religious persons who refusein our day to accept even a minimum of Bible miracles in all their crudeness, and who, seeking to reduce them to theminimum, hide and conceal it in the furthermost corners of the past.\"**But the \"supernatural\" of Renan belongs to dogma and its dead letter. It has nought to do with its Spirit nor with the realityof facts in Nature.

For Nature never proceeds byjumps and starts, and logic and common sense, besides geology, anthropology and ethnology, have justly rebelledagainst such assertions. But if that same theology, giving up her fantastic chronology, had claimed that men lived 969years -- the age of Methuselah -- five million years ago, we would have nothing to say against the claim. For in those daysthe physical frame of men was, compared to the present human body, as that of a megalosaurus to a common lizard.A naturalist suggests another difficulty. The human is the only species which, however unequal in its races, can breedtogether. \"There is no question of selection between human races,\" say the anti-Darwinists, and no evolutionist can denythe argument -- one which very triumphantly proves specific unity. How then can Occultism insist that a portion of theFourth Race humanity begot young ones from females of another, only semi-human, if not quite an animal, race, thehybrids resulting from which union not only bred freely but produced the ancestors of the modern anthropoid apes?Esoteric science replies to this that it was in the very beginnings of physical man. Since then, Nature has changed herways, and sterility is the only result of the crime of man's bestiality. But we have to this day proofs of this. The SecretDoctrine teaches that the specific unity of mankind is not without exceptions even now. For there are, or rather still were afew years ago, descendants of these half-animal tribes or races, both of remote Lemurian and Lemuro-Atlantean origin.The world knows them as Tasmanians (now extinct), Australians, Andaman Islanders, etc. The descent of theTasmanians can be almost proved by a fact, which struck Darwin a good deal, without his being able to make anything ofit. This fact deserves notice.Now de Quatrefages and other naturalists, who seek to prove Monogenesis by the very fact of every race of mankindbeing capable of crossing with every other, have left out of their calculations exceptions, which do not in this case confirmthe rule. Human crossing may have been a general rule from the time of the separation of sexes, and yet that other law"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"may assert itself, viz., sterility between two human races, just as between two animal species of various kinds, in thoserare cases when a European, condescending to see in a female of a savage tribe a mate, happens to chose a member ofsuch mixed tribes.* Darwin notes such[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Of such semi-animal creatures, the sole remnants known to Ethnology were the Tasmanians, a portion of theAustralians and a mountain tribe in China, the men and women of which are entirely covered with hair.

There are, however, considerablenumbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 196 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.a case in a Tasmanian tribe, whose women were suddenly struck with sterility, en masse, some time after the arrivalamong them of the European colonists. The great naturalist tried to explain this fact by change of diet, food, conditions,etc., but finally gave up the solution of the mystery. For the Occultist it is a very evident one. \"Crossing,\" as it is called, ofEuropeans with Tasmanian women -- i.e., the representatives of a race, whose progenitors were a \"soulless\"* andmindless monster and a real human, though still as mindless a man -- brought on sterility. This, not alone as aconsequence of a physiological law, but also as a decree of Karmic evolution in the question of further survival of theabnormal race. In no one point of the above is Science prepared to believe as yet -- but it will have to in the long run.Esoteric philosophy, let us remember, only fills the gaps made by science and corrects her false premises.Yet, in this particular, geology and even botany and zoology support the esoteric teachings. It has been suggested bymany geologists that the Australian native -- co-existing as he does with an archaic fauna and flora -- must date back toan enormous antiquity. The whole environment of this mysterious race, about whose origin ethnology is silent, is atestimony to the truth of the esoteric position.\"It is a very curious fact,\" says Jukes,** \"that not only these marsupial animals (the mammals found in the Oxfordshirestone-field slates), but several of the shells -- as for instance, the Trigonias and even some of the plants found fossil inthe Oolitic rocks -- much more nearly resemble those now living in Australia than the living forms of any other part of theglobe. This might be explained on the supposition that, since the 0olitic (Jurassic) period, less change has taken place inAustralia than elsewhere, and that the Australian flora and fauna consequently retain some-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] crossings with such semi-human stocks -- e.g., the wild men of Borneo, theVeddhas of Ceylon, classed by Prof. Flower among Aryans (!), most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos,Andaman Islanders, etc.The Australians of the Gulf of St. Vincent and the neighbourhood of Adelaide are very hairy, and the brown down on theskin of boys of five or six years of age assumes a furry appearance. They are, however, degraded men -- not the closestapproximation to the \"pithecoid man,\" as Haeckel so sweepingly affirms. Only a portion of these men are a Lemurianrelic. (Cf. \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" p.55.)* In calling the animal \"Soulless,\" it is not depriving the beast, from the humblest to the highest species, of a \"soul,\" butonly of a conscious surviving Ego-soul, i.e., that principle which survives after a man, and reincarnates in a like man. Theanimal has an astral body, that survives the physical form for a short period; but its (animal) Monad does not re-incarnatein the same, but in a higher species, and has no \"Devachan\" of course. It has the seeds of all the human principles initself, but they are latent.** \"Manual of Geology,\" p. 302.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 197 THE SEPARATION OF SEXES.thing of the Oolitic type, while it had been altogether supplanted and replaced on the rest of the Globe.\" (! !)Now why has less change taken place in Australia than elsewhere? Where is the raison d'etre for such a \"curse ofretardation\"? It is simply because the nature of the environment develops pari passu with the race concerned.Correspondences rule in every quarter. The survivors of those later Lemurians, who escaped the destruction of theirfellows when the main continent was submerged, became the ancestors of a portion of the present native tribes. Being avery low sub-race, begotten originally of animals, of monsters, whose very fossils are now resting miles under the seafloors, their stock has since existed in an environment strongly subjected to the law of retardation. Australia is one of theoldest lands now above the waters, and in the senile decrepitude of old age, its \"virgin soil\" notwithstanding. It canproduce no new forms, unless helped by new and fresh races, and artificial cultivation and breeding.To return, however, once more to the history of the Third Race, the \"Sweat-Born,\" the \"Egg-bearing,\" and the\"Androgyne.\" Almost sexless, in its early beginnings, it became bisexual or androgynous; very gradually of course. Thepassage from the former to the latter transformation required numberless generations, during which the simple cell thatissued from the earliest parent (the two in one), first developed into a bisexual being; and then the cell, becoming aregular egg, gave forth a unisexual creature. The Third-Race-mankind is the most mysterious of all the hitherto developedfive Races. The mystery of the \"How\" of the generation of the distinct sexes must, of course, be very obscure here, as it isthe business of an embryologist and a specialist, the present work giving only faint outlines of the process. But it isevident that the units of the Third Race humanity began to separate in their pre-natal shells, or eggs,* and to issue out ofthem as distinct male and female babes, ages after the appearance of its early progenitors. And, as time rolled on itsgeological periods, the newly born sub-races began to lose their natal capacities. Toward the end of the fourth sub-race,the babe lost its faculty of walking as soon as liberated from its shell, and by the end of the fifth, mankind was born under"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the same conditions and by the same identical process as our historical generations.

Let us see what occult philosophy says on the originof language.-------36. THE FOURTH RACE DEVELOPED SPEECH.The Commentaries explain that the first Race -- the ethereal or astral Sons of Yoga, also called \"Self-born\" -- was, in oursense, speechless, as it was devoid of mind on our plane. The Second Race had a \"Sound-language,\" to wit, chant-likesounds composed of vowels alone. The Third Race developed in the beginning a kind of language which was only aslight improvement on the various sounds in Nature, on the cry of gigantic insects and of the first animals, which,however, were hardly nascent in the day of the \"Sweat-born\" (the early Third Race). In its second half, when the \"Sweat-born\" gave birth to the \"Egg-born,\" (the middle Third Race); and when these, instead of \"hatching out\" (may the readerpardon the rather ridiculous expression when applied to human beings in our age) as androgynous beings, began toevolve into separate males and females; and when the same law of evolution led them to reproduce their kind sexually,an act which forced the creative gods, compelled by Karmic law, to incarnate in mindless men; then only was speechdeveloped. But even then it was still no better than a tentative effort. The whole human race was at that time of \"onelanguage and of one lip.\" This did not prevent the last two Sub-Races of the Third Race* from building cities, and sowingfar and wide the first seeds of civilization under the guidance of their divine instructors,** and their own already awakenedminds. Let the reader also bear in mind that, as each of the seven races is divided into four ages -- the Golden, Silver,Bronze, and Iron Age -- so is every smallest division of such races.*** Speech then developed, according to occultteaching, in the following order:--I. Monosyllabic speech; that of the first approximately fully developed human beings at the close of the Third Root-race,the \"golden-coloured,\" yellow-complexioned men, after their separation into sexes, and the full[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* To avoid confusion, let the reader remember that the term Root-Race applies to one of the seven great Races, sub-Race to one of its great Branches, and Family-Race to one of the sub-divisions, which include nations and large tribes.** In the Section on the Divine Dynasties, the nature of these \"Instructors\" is explained.*** Vide Section attached to the \"Divisions into Yugas.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 199 PRIMEVAL LANGUAGE.awakening of their minds. Before that, they communicated through what would now be called \"thought-transference,\"though, with the exception of the Race called the \"Sons of Will and Yoga\" -- the first in whom the \"Sons of Wisdom\" hadincarnated -- thought was but very little developed in nascent physical man, and never soared above a low terrestriallevel. Their physical bodies belonging to the Earth, their Monads remained on a higher plane altogether. Language couldnot be well developed before the full acquisition and development of their reasoning faculties. This monosyllabic speechwas the vowel parent, so to speak, of the monosyllabic languages mixed with hard consonants, still in use amongst theyellow races which are known to the anthropologist.*II. These linguistic characteristics developed into the agglutinative languages. The latter were spoken by some Atlanteanraces, while other parent stocks of the Fourth Race preserved the mother-language. And as languages have their cyclicevolution, their childhood, purity, growth, fall into matter, admixture with other languages, maturity, decay and finallydeath,** so the primitive speech of the most civilized Atlantean races -- that language, which is referred to as \"RakshasiBhasa,\" in old Sanskrit works -- decayed and almost died out. While the \"cream\" of the Fourth Race gravitated more andmore toward the apex of physical and intellectual evolution, thus leaving as an heirloom to the nascent Fifth (the Aryan)Race the inflectional, highly developed languages, the agglutinative decayed and remained as a fragmentary fossil idiom,scattered now, and nearly limited to the aboriginal tribes of America.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The present yellow races are the descendants, however, of the early branches of the Fourth Race. Of the third, the onlypure and direct descendants are, as said above, a portion of the fallen and degenerated Australians, whose far distantancestors belonged to a division of the seventh Sub-race of the Third. The rest are of mixed Lemuro-Atlantean descent.They have since then entirely changed in stature and intellectual capacities."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"** Language is certainly coeval with reason, and could never have been developed before men became one with theinforming principles in them -- those who fructified and awoke to life the manasic element dormant in primitive man. For,as Professor Max Muller tells us in his \"Science of Thought,\" \"Thought and language are identical.\" Yet to add to this thereflection that thoughts which are too deep for words, do not really exist at all, is rather risky, as thought impressed uponthe astral tablets exists in eternity whether expressed or not. Logos is both reason and speech. But language, proceedingin cycles, is not always adequate to express spiritual thoughts. Moreover, in one sense, the Greek Logos is the equivalentof the Sanscrit Vach, \"the immortal (intellectual) ray of spirit.\" And the fact that Vach (as Devasena, an aspect ofSaraswati, the goddess of hidden Wisdom) is the spouse of the eternal celibate Kumara, unveils a suggestive, thoughveiled, reference to the Kumaras, those \"who refused to create,\" but who were compelled later on to complete divine Manby incarnating in him. All this will be fully explained in the sections that follow.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 200 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.III. The inflectional speech -- the root of the Sanskrit, very erroneously called \"the elder sister\" of the Greek, instead of itsmother -- was the first language (now the mystery tongue of the Initiates, of the Fifth Race). At any rate, the \"Semitic\"languages are the bastard descendants of the first phonetic corruptions of the eldest children of the early Sanskrit. Theoccult doctrine admits of no such divisions as the Aryan and the Semite, accepting even the Turanian with amplereservations. The Semites, especially the Arabs, are later Aryans -- degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality.To these belong all the Jews and the Arabs. The former are a tribe descended from the Tchandalas of India, the outcasts,many of them ex-Brahmins, who sought refuge in Chaldea, in Scinde, and Aria (Iran), and were truly born from theirfather A-bram (No Brahmin) some 8,000 years B.C. The latter, the Arabs, are the descendants of those Aryans whowould not go into India at the time of the dispersion of nations, some of whom remained on the borderlands thereof, inAfghanistan and Kabul,* and along the Oxus, while others penetrated into and invaded Arabia.But this was when Africa had already been raised as a continent. We have meanwhile to follow, as closely as limitedspace will permit, the gradual evolution of the now truly human species. It is in the suddenly arrested evolution of certainsub-races, and their forced and violent diversion into the purely animal line by artificial cross-breeding, truly analogous tothe hybridization, which we have now learned to utilize in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, that we have to look for theorigin of the anthropoids.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Ptolemy, speaking in his ninth table of the Kabolitae (Kabul tribes), calls them [[Aristophuloi]], the aristocratic or nobletribes. The Afghans call themselves Ben-Issrael (children of Is(sa)rael), from Issa, \"woman and also earth,\" Sons ofMother Earth. But if you call an Afghan Yahoudi (Jew), he will kill you. The subject is fully treated elsewhere. The namesof the supposed twelve tribes and the names of the real tribes, the same in number, of the Afghans, are the same. TheAfghans being far older (at any rate, their Arabic stock) than the Israelites, no one need be surprised to find such tribalnames among them as Youssoufzic, \"Sons of Joseph\" in Punjcaure and Boonere; the Zablistanee (Zebulon); Ben-manasseh (sons of Manasseh) among the Khojar Tartars; Isaguri, or Issachar (now Ashnagor in Afghanistan), etc., etc.The whole twelve names of the so-called twelve tribes are names of the signs of the Zodiac, as is now well proven. At anyrate, the names of the oldest Arabic tribes, re-transliterated, yield the names of the zodiacal signs and of the mythicalsons of Jacob likewise. Where are the traces of the Jewish twelve tribes? Nowhere. But there is a trace, and a good one,that the Jews have tried to deceive people with the help of those names. For, see what happens ages after the ten tribeshad wholly disappeared from Babylon. Ptolemy Philadelphus, desiring to have the Hebrew Law translated for him intoGreek (the famous Septuagint), wrote to the high priest of the Jews, Eleazar, to send him six men from each of the twelvetribes; and the seventy-two representatives (of whom sixty were ghosts apparently) came to the king in Egypt andtranslated the law amid miracles and wonders. See Butler's \"Horae Biblicae,\" Josephus, and Philo Judaeus.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 201 THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE EARTH.In these red-haired and hair-covered monsters, the fruit of the unnatural connection between men and animals, the\"Lords of Wisdom\" did not incarnate, as we see. Thus by a long series of transformations due to unnatural cross-breeding(unnatural \"sexual selection\"), originated in due course of time the lowest specimens of humanity; while further bestialityand the fruit of their first animal efforts of reproduction begat a species which developed into mammalian apes ageslater.*As to the separation of sexes, it did not occur suddenly, as one may think. Nature proceeds slowly in whatever she does.-------37.

But what could the ancients know of antediluvian prehistoric animals and monsters! Nevertheless, in Book VI. ofthe Commentaries is found a passage which says, freely translated:--\"When the Third separated and fell into sin by breeding men-animals, these (the animals) became ferocious, and menand they mutually destructive. Till then, there was no sin, no life taken. After (the separation) the Satya (Yuga) was at anend. The eternal spring became constant change and seasons succeeded. Cold forced men to build shelters and deviseclothing. Then man appealed to the superior Fathers (the higher gods or angels). The Nirmanakaya of the Nagas, thewise Serpents and Dragons of Light came, and the precursors of the Enlightened (Buddhas). Divine Kings descendedand taught men sciences and arts, for man could live no longer in the first land (Adi-Varsha, the Eden of the first Races),which had turned into a white frozen corpse.\""},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The above is suggestive.

Some may incline to think that thereis more in it than is apparent at first sight.-------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Commentary explains that the apes are the only species, among the animals, which has gradually and with everygeneration and variety tended more and more to return to the original type of its male forefather -- the dark giganticLemurian and Atlantean.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 202 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.EDENS, SERPENTS, AND DRAGONS.Whence the idea, and the true meaning of the term \"Eden\"? Christians will maintain that the Garden of Eden is the holyParadise, the place desecrated by the sin of Adam and Eve; the Occultist will deny this dead-letter interpretation, andshow the reverse. One need not believe and see in the Bible divine revelation in order to say that this ancient book, ifread esoterically, is based upon the same universal traditions. What Eden was is partially shown in Isis Unveiled.*It was said that: \"The Garden of Eden as a locality is no myth at all; it belongs to those landmarks of history whichoccasionally disclose to the student that the Bible is not all mere allegory. Eden, or the Hebrew [[hebrew]] Gan-Eden,meaning the park or the garden of Eden, is an archaic name of the country watered by the Euphrates and its manybranches, from Asia and Armenia to the Erythraean sea.\" (A. Wilder says that Gan-duniyas is a name of Babylonia.) Inthe Chaldean \"Book of Numbers,\" the location is designated in numerals, and in the cypher Rosicrucian manuscript, leftby Count St. Germain, it is fully described. In the Assyrian Tablets it is rendered Ganduniyas. \"Behold,\" says the[[hebrew]] (Elohim) of Genesis, \"the man is become as one of us.\" The Elohim may be accepted in one sense for gods orpowers, and in another for Aleim, or priests -- the hierophants initiated into the good and evil of this world; for there was acollege of priests called the Aleim, while the head of their caste, or the chief of the hierophants was known as Java-Aleim.Instead of becoming a neophyte, and gradually obtaining his esoteric knowledge through a regular initiation, an Adam, orMan, uses his intuitional faculties and, prompted by the serpent (Woman and matter), tastes of the Tree of Knowledge --the esoteric or Secret Doctrine -- unlawfully. The priests of Hercules, or Mel-karth, the \"Lord of the Eden,\" all wore \"coatsof skin.\" The text says: \"And Java-Aleim made for Adam and his wife [[hebrew]] 'Chitonuth our.' \" The first Hebrew word,\"chiton,\" is the Greek [[Chiton]], Chiton. It became a Slavonic word by adoption from the Bible, and means a coat, anupper garment.\"Though containing the same substratum of esoteric truth as does every early Cosmogony, the Hebrew Scripture wearson its face the marks of a double origin. Its Genesis is purely a reminiscence of the Babylonian captivity. The names ofplaces, men and even objects, can be traced from the original text to the Chaldeans and the Akkadians, the progenitorsand Aryan instructors of the former. It is strongly contested that the Akkad tribes of Chaldea, Babylonia and Assyria werein[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vol. I., pp. 575, et seq.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 203 THE GARDEN OF EDEN, A COLLEGE.any way cognate with the Brahmans of Hindostan; but there are more proofs in favour of this opinion than otherwise. TheShemite or Assyrian ought, perchance, to have been called the Turanian, and the Mongolians have been denominatedScyths. But if the Akkadians ever existed, otherwise than in the imagination of some ethnologists and philologists, theycertainly would never have been a Turanian tribe, as some Assyriologists have striven to make us believe. They weresimply emigrants on their way to Asia Minor from India, the cradle of humanity, and their sacerdotal adepts tarried tocivilize and initiate a barbarian people. Halevy proved the fallacy of the Turanian mania in regard to Akkadian people, andother scientists have proved that the Babylonian civilization was neither born nor developed in that country. It wasimported from India, and the importers were Brahminical Hindus.\"And now, ten years after this was written, we find ourselves corroborated by Professor Sayce, who says in his firstHibbert lecture that the culture of the Babylonian city Eridu was of foreign importation. It came from India.\"Much of the theology was borrowed by the Semites from the non-Semitic Akkadians or proto-Chaldeans, whom theysupplanted, and whose local cults they had neither the will nor the power to uproot. Indeed, throughout a long course ofages the two races, Semites and Akkadians, lived side by side, their notions and worship of the gods blending insensiblytogether.\"Here, the Akkadians are called \"non-Semitic,\" as we had insisted they were in \"Isis,\" which is another corroboration. Andwe are no less right in always maintaining that the Jewish Biblical history was a compilation of historical facts, arrangedfrom other people's history in Jewish garb -- Genesis excluded, which is esotericism pure and simple. But it is really fromthe Euxine to Kashmir and beyond, that science has to search for the cradle -- or rather one of the chief cradles -- ofmankind and the sons of Ad-ah; and especially in after times, when the Garden of Ed-en on the Euphrates became thecollege of the astrologers and magi, the Aleim.But this \"college\" and this Eden belong to the Fifth Race, and are simply a faint reminiscence of the Adi-varsha, of theprimeval Third Race. What is the etymological meaning of the word Eden? In Greek it is [hedone], signifyingvoluptuousness. In this aspect it is no better than the Olympus of the Greeks, Indra's heaven (Swarga) on Mount Meru,and even the paradise full of Houris, promised by Mahomet to the faithful. The Garden of Eden was never the property of"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the Jews; for China, which can hardly be suspected of having known anything of the Jews 2,000 B.C., has such aprimitive garden in Central Asia inhabited by the \"Dragons of Wisdom,\" the Initiates.

For the former -- Eden Illa-ah -- means in onesense Wisdom, a state like that of Nirvana, a paradise of Bliss; while in another sense it refers to Intellectual man himself,the container of the Eden in which grows the tree of Knowledge of good and evil: man being the Knower thereof.Renan and Barthelemy St. Hilaire, basing themselves \"on the most solid inductions,\" think it impossible to doubt anylonger, and both place the cradle of humanity \"on the region of the Timaus.\" Finally, the Asiatic Journal* concludes that:\"All the traditions of the human race gathering its primitive families at the region of their birth-place, show them to usgrouped around the countries where Jewish tradition places the Garden of Eden; where the Aryans (Zoroastrians)established their Airyana-vaego or the Meru (?). They are hemmed in to the North by the countries which join the lakeAral, and to the South by Baltistan, or Little Tibet. Everything concurs in proving that there was the abode of that primitivehumanity to which we have to be traced.\"That \"primitive humanity\" was in its Fifth Race, when the \"four-mouthed Dragon,\" the lake, of which very few traces arenow left, was the abode of the \"Sons of Wisdom,\" the first mind-born sons of the Third Race. Yet it was neither the onlyone nor the primitive cradle of humanity, though it was the copy of the cradle, verily, of the first thinking divine man. It wasthe Paradesa, the highland of the first Sanskrit-speaking people, the Hedone, the country of delight of the Greeks, but itwas not the \"bower of voluptuousness\" of the Chaldeans, for the latter was only the reminiscence of it; and also becauseit was not there that the Fall of Man occurred after the \"separation.\" The Eden of the Jews was copied from the Chaldeancopy.That the Fall of man into generation occurred during the earliest portion of what science calls the Mesozoic times, or theage of the reptiles, is evidenced by the Bible phraseology concerning the serpent, the nature of which is explained in theZohar. The question is not whether Eve's incident with the tempting reptile is allegorical or textual, for no one can doubtthat it is the former, but to show the antiquity of the symbolism on the very face of it, and that it was not only a Jewish butan universal idea.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Journal Asiatique,\" seventh year, 1855.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 205 FLYING CAMELS.Now we find in the Zohar a very strange assertion, one that is calculated to provoke the reader to merry laughter by itsludicrous absurdity. It tells us that the serpent, which was used by Shamael (the supposed Satan), to seduce Eve, was akind of flying camel [[kamelomorphon]].A \"flying camel\" is indeed too much for the most liberal-minded F.R.S. Nevertheless, the Zohar, which can hardly beexpected to use the language of a Cuvier, was right in its description:* for we find it called in the old Zoroastrian MSS.Aschmogh, which in the Avesta is represented as having lost after the Fall \"its nature and its name,\" and is described asa huge serpent with a camel's neck.\"There are no winged serpents, nor veritable dragons,\" asserts Salverte,** \" . . . grasshoppers are called by the Greekswinged serpents, and this metaphor may have created several narratives on the existence of winged serpents.\"There are none now; but there is no reason why they should not have existed during the Mesozoic age; and Cuvier, whohas reconstructed their skeletons, is a witness to \"flying camels.\" Already, after finding simple fossils of certain saurians,the great naturalist has written, that, \"if anything can justify the Hydra and other monsters, whose figures were so oftenrepeated by mediaeval historians, it is incontestably the Plesiosaurus.\"***We are unaware if Cuvier had added anything in the way of a further mea culpa. But we may well imagine his confusion,for all his slanders against archaic veracity, when he found himself in the presence of a flying saurian, \"the Pterodactyl\"(found in Germany), \"78 feet long, and carrying vigorous wings attached to its reptilian body.\" That fossil is described as areptile, the little fingers of whose hands are so elongated as to bear a long membranous wing. Here, then, the \"flyingcamel\" of the Zohar is vindicated. For surely, between the long neck of the Plesiosaurus and the membranous wing of thePterodactyl, or still better the Mosasaurus, there is enough scientific probability to build a \"flying camel,\" or a long-neckeddragon. Prof. Cope, of Philadelphia, has shown that the Mosasaurus fossil in the chalk was a winged serpent of this kind.There are characters in its vertebrae, which indicate union with the Ophidia rather than with the Lacertilia.And now to the main question. It is well known that Antiquity has never claimed palaeontography and paleontologyamong its arts and sciences; and it never had its Cuviers. Yet on Babylonian tiles, and especially in old Chinese andJapanese drawings, in the oldest Pagodas[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Moses Maimonides, \"More Nevochim.\""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"** \"Science Occulte,\" p. 646.*** \"Revolution du Globe,\" vol. v., p. 464.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 206 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and monuments, and in the Imperial library at Pekin, many a traveller has seen and recognised perfect representations ofPlesiosauri and Pterodactyls in the multiform Chinese dragons.* Moreover, the prophets speak in the Bible of the flyingfiery serpents,** and Job mentions the Leviathan.*** Now the following questions are put very directly:--I. How could the ancient nations know anything of the extinct monsters of the carboniferous and Mesozoic times, andeven represent and describe them orally and pictorially, unless they had either seen those monsters themselves orpossessed descriptions of them in their traditions, which descriptions necessitate living and intelligent eye-witnesses?II. And if such eye-witnesses are once admitted (unless retrospective clairvoyance is granted), how can humanity and thefirst palaeolithic men be no earlier than about the middle of the tertiary period? We must bear in mind that most of themen of science will not allow man to have appeared before the Quaternary period, and thus shut him out completely fromthe Cenozoic times. Here we have extinct species of animals, which disappeared from the face of the Earth millions ofyears ago, described by, and known to, nations whose civilization, it is said, could hardly have begun a few thousandyears ago. How is this? Evidently either the Mesozoic time has to be made to overlap the Quaternary period, or man mustbe made the contemporary of the Pterodactyl and the Plesiosaurus.It does not stand to reason, because the Occultists believe in and defend ancient wisdom and science, even thoughwinged saurians are called \"flying camels\" in the translations of the Zohar, that we believe as readily in all the storieswhich the middle ages give us of such dragons. Pterodactyls and Plesiosauri ceased to exist with the bulk[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We read in the \"Memoire a l'Academie\" of the \"naive astonishment of Geoffrey St. Hilaire, when M. de Paravey showedto him in some old Chinese works and Babylonian tiles dragons, . . . . saurians and ornithorhynchuses (aquatic animalsfound only in Australia), etc., extinct animals that he had thought unknown on earth. . . . till his own day.\"** See Isaiah, xxx. 6: \"The viper and the flying serpent unto the land of trouble and anguish,\" and the fiery serpentsconquered by the brazen serpent of Moses.*** The fossils reconstructed by science, which we know ought to be sufficient warrant for the possibility of even aLeviathan, let alone Isaiah's flying serpents, or saraph mehophep, which words are translated in all the Hebrewdictionaries as \"saraph,\" enflamed or fiery venom, and \"mehophep,\" flying. But, although Christian theology has alwaysconnected both (Leviathan and saraph mehophep) with the devil, the expressions are metaphorical and have nought todo with the \"evil one.\" But the word Dracon has become a synonym for the latter. In Bretagne the word Drouk nowsignifies \"devil,\" whence, as we are told by Cambry (\"Monuments Celtiques,\" p. 299), the devil's tomb in England,Draghedanum sepulcrum. In Languedoc the meteoric fires and will-o'-the-wisps are called Dragg, and in Bretagne Dreag,Wraie (or wraith), the castle of Drogheda in Ireland meaning the devil's castle.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 207 KIRCHER'S DRAGON.of the Third Race. When, therefore, we are gravely asked by Roman Catholic writers to credit Christopher Scherer's andFather Kircher's cock-and-bull stories of their having seen with their own eyes living fiery and flying dragons, respectivelyin 1619 and 1669, we may be allowed to regard their assertions as either dreams or fibs.* Nor shall we regard otherwisethan as a poetical license that other story told of Petrarch, who, while following one day his Laura in the woods andpassing near a cave, is credited with having found a dragon, whom he forthwith stabbed with his dagger and killed, thuspreventing the monster from devouring the lady of his heart.** We would willingly believe the story had Petrarch lived inthe days of Atlantis, when such antediluvian monsters may still have existed. We deny their existence in our present era.The sea-serpent is one thing, the dragon quite another. The former is denied by the majority because it exists and lives inthe very depths of the ocean, is very scarce, and rises to the surface only when compelled, perhaps, by hunger. Thuskeeping invisible, it may exist and still be denied. But if there was such a thing as a dragon of the above description, howcould it have ever escaped detection? It is a creature contemporary with the earliest Fifth Race, and exists no more.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The ultramontane writers accept the whole series of draconian stories given by Father Kircher (Edipus AEgyptiacus, \"DeGenere Draconum,\") quite seriously. According to that Jesuit, he himself saw a dragon which was killed in 1669 by aRoman peasant, as the director of the Museo Barberini sent it to him, to take the beast's likeness, which Father Kircherdid and had it published in one of his in-folios. After this he received a letter from Christopher Scherer, Prefect of theCanton of Soleure, Switzerland, in which that official certifies to his having seen himself with his own eyes, one finesummer night in 1619, a living dragon. Having remained on his balcony \"to contemplate the perfect purity of thefirmament,\" he writes, \"I saw a fiery, shining dragon rise from one of the caves of Mount Pilatus and direct itself rapidlytowards Fluelen to the other end of the lake. Enormous in size, his tail was still longer and his neck very extended. Hishead and jaws were those of a serpent. In flying he emitted on his way numerous sparks (? !) . . . . I thought at first I wasseeing a meteor, but soon looking more attentively, I was convinced by his flight and the conformation of his body that Isaw a veritable dragon. I am happy to be thus able to enlighten your Reverence on the very real existence of thoseanimals\"; in dreams, the writer ought to have added, of long past ages.** As a convincing proof of the reality of the fact, a Roman Catholic refers the reader to the picture of that incident paintedby Simon de Sienne, a friend of the poet, on the portal of the Church Notre Dame du Don at Avignon; notwithstanding theprohibition of the Sovereign Pontiff, who \"would not allow this triumph of love to be enthroned in the holy place\"; and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"adds: \"Time has injured and rubbed out the work of art, but has not weakened its tradition.\" De Mirville's \"Dragon-Devils\"of our era seem to have no luck, as they disappear most mysteriously from the museums where they are said to havebeen.

We answer: firstly, because the knowledge of such animals is aproof of the enormous antiquity of the human race; and secondly, to show the difference between the zoological realmeaning of the words \"dragon,\" \"Naga,\" and \"Serpent,\" and the metaphorical one, when used symbolically. The profanereader, who knows nothing of the mystery language, is likely, whenever he finds one of these words mentioned, to acceptit literally. Hence, the quid pro quos and unjust accusations. A couple of instances will suffice.Sed et serpens? aye: but what was the nature of the serpent? Mystics intuitionally see in the serpent of Genesis ananimal emblem and a high spiritual essence: a cosmic force superintelligent, a \"great fallen light,\" a spirit sidereal, aerialand tellurian at the same time, \"whose influence circumambulates the globe (qui circumambulat terram), as a Christianfanatic of the dead-letter (de Mirville) has it, and which only manifested itself under the physical emblem, which was themost convenient \"with respect to its moral and intellectual coils\": i.e. under the ophidian form.But what will Christians make of the Brazen Serpent, the \"DIVINE HEALER,\" if the serpent is to be regarded as theemblem of cunning and evil? The \"Evil One\" itself? How can the line of demarcation ever be settled, when it is tracedarbitrarily in a sectarian theological spirit. For, if the followers of the Roman Church are taught that Mercury andAEsculapius, or Asclepios, who are, in truth, one, are \"devils and sons of devils,\" and the wand and serpent of the latterwere \"the devil's wand\"; how about the \"brazen serpent\" of Moses? Every scholar knows that both the heathen wand andthe Jewish \"serpent\" are one and the same, namely, the Caduceus of Mercury, son of APOLLO-PYTHON. It is easy tocomprehend why the Jews adopted the ophidian shape for their \"seducer.\" With them it was purely physiological andphallic; and no amount of casuistical reasoning on the part of the Roman Catholic Church can give it another meaning,once that the mystery language is well studied, and that the Hebrew scrolls are read numerically. The Occultists knowthat the serpent, the Naga, and the dragon have each a septenary meaning; that the Sun, for instance, was theastronomical and cosmic emblem of the two contrasted lights, and the two serpents of the Gnostics, the good and the evilone; they also know that, when generalised, the conclusions of both science and theology present two most ridiculousextremes. For, when the former tells us that it is sufficient to trace the legends of the serpents to their primal source, theastrological legend, and to meditate seriously on the Sun, conqueror of Python, and the celestial virgin in the Zodiacforcing back the devouring dragon, if we would have the key of all the subsequent religious dogmas; it is easy to perceivethat, instead of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 209 COBRAS AS SYMBOLS.generalising, the author simply has his eye on Christian religion and Revelation. We call this one extreme. The other wesee in this: when, repeating the famous decision of the Council of Trent, theology seeks to convince the masses that\"from the fall of man until the hour of his baptism the devil has full power over him, and possesses him by right (diabolumdominationem et potestatem super homines habere et jure cos possidere).\" To this Occult philosophy answers: Provefirst the existence of the devil as an entity, and then we may believe in such congenital possession. A very small amountof observation and knowledge of human nature may be sufficient to prove the fallacy of this theological dogma. HadSATAN any reality, in the objective or even subjective world (in the ecclesiastical sense), it is the poor devil who wouldfind himself chronically obsessed and even possessed by the wicked -- hence by the bulk of mankind. It is humanity itself,and especially the clergy, headed by the haughty, unscrupulous and intolerant Roman Church, which have begotten,given birth to, and reared in love the evil one; but this is a digression.\"The whole world of thought is reproached by the Church with having adored the serpent. The whole of humanity'incensed and at the same time stoned it.' The Zend Avesta speaks of it as the Kings and Vedas do, as the Edda and theBible. . . . Everywhere the sacred serpent, the naga, and its shrine and its priest; in Rome it is the Vestal who prepares itsmeal with the same care as she bestows on the sacred fire. In Greece, AEsculapius cannot cure without its assistance,and delegates to it his powers. Everyone has heard of the famous Roman embassy sent by the Senate to the god ofmedicine and its return with the not less famous serpent, which proceeded of its own will and by itself toward its Master'stemple on one of the islands of the Tiber. Not a Bacchante that did not wind it (the serpent) in her hair, not an Augur butquestioned it oracularly, not a necromancer whose tomb is free from its presence! The Cainites and the Ophites call itCreator, while recognizing, as Schelling did, that the serpent is 'evil in substance and its personification.' \"*Yes, the author is right, and if one would have a complete idea of the prestige which the serpent enjoys to our own day,one ought to study the matter in India and learn all that is believed about, and still attributed to, the Nagas (Cobras) in thatcountry; one should also visit the Africans of Whydah, the Voodoos of Port-au-Prince and Jamaica, the Nagals of Mexico,and the Pa, or men-serpents of China, &c.

These \"originals\" -- called to this day in China \"the Dragons ofWisdom\" -- were the first disciples of the Dhyanis, who were their instructors; in short, the primitive adepts of the ThirdRace, and later, of the Fourth and Fifth Races. The name became universal, and no sane man before the Christian erawould ever have confounded the man and the symbol.The symbol of Chnouphis, or the soul of the world, writes Champollion, \"is among others that of an enormous serpentstanding on human legs; this reptile, the emblem of the good genius, is a veritable Agathodaemon.

We know of no serpent, or reptile-eaters except in Christiancivilized countries, where they begin with frogs and eels, and must end with real snakes, as they have begun with lamband ended with horse-flesh.** \"Pantheon,\" 3.*** The solar Chnouphis, or Agathodaemon, is the Christos of the Gnostics, as every scholar knows. He is intimatelyconnected with the seven sons of Sophia (Wisdom), the seven sons of Aditi (universal Wisdom), her eighth beingMartanda, the Sun, which seven are the seven planetary regents or genii. Therefore Chnouphis was the spiritual Sun ofEnlightenment, of Wisdom, hence the patron of all the Egyptian Initiates, as Bel-Merodach (or Bel-Belitanus) becamelater with the Chaldeans.**** Hermes, or rather Thot, was a generic name. Abul Teda shows in \"Historia Anti-Islamitica\" five Hermes, and thenames of Hermes, Nebo, Thot were given respectively in various countries to great Initiates. Thus Nebo, the son ofMerodach and Zarpanitu (whom Herodotus calls Zeus-Belos), gave his name to all the great prophets, seers and Initiates.They were all \"serpents of Wisdom,\" as connected with the Sun astronomically, and with Wisdom spiritually.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 211 TWO SCHOOLS OF MAGIC.Hermes), to whom Hermes Trismegistus attributes the invention of magic.\"*The \"invention of magic!\" A strange term to use, as though the unveiling of the eternal and actual mysteries of naturecould be invented! As well attribute, millenniums hence, the invention instead of the discovery of radiant matter to Prof.Crookes. Hermes was not the inventor, or even the discoverer, for, as said in the foot-note, Thot-Hermes is a genericname, as is Enoch (Enoichion, the \"inner, spiritual eye\"), Nebo, the prophet and seer, etc. It is not the proper name of anyone living man, but a generic title of many adepts. Their connection in symbolic allegories with the serpent is due to theirenlightenment by the solar and planetary gods during the earliest intellectual Race, the Third. They are all therepresentative patrons of the Secret Wisdom. Asclepios is the son of the Sun-god Apollo -- and he is Mercury; Nebo isthe son of Bel-Merodach; Vaivasvata Manu, the great Rishi, is the son of Vivisvat -- the Sun or Surya, etc., etc. And while,astronomically, the Nagas along with the Rishis, the Gandharvas, Apsarasas, Gramanis (or Yakshas, minor gods)Yatudhanas and Devas, are the Sun's attendants throughout the twelve solar months; in theogony, and also inanthropological evolution, they are gods and men -- when incarnated in the nether world. Let the reader be reminded, inthis connection, of the fact that Apollonius met in Kashmir Buddhist Nagas -- which are neither serpents zoologically, noryet the Nagas ethnologically, but \"wise men.\"The Bible, from Genesis to Revelations, is but a series of historical records of the great struggle between white and blackMagic, between the Adepts of the right path, the Prophets, and those of the left, the Levites, the clergy of the brutalmasses. Even the students of Occultism, though some of them have more archaic MSS. and direct teaching to rely upon,find it difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the Sodales of the Right Path and those of the Left. The greatschism that arose between the sons of the Fourth Race, as soon as the first Temples and Halls of Initiation had beenerected under the guidance of \"the Sons of God,\" is allegorized in the Sons of Jacob. That there were two schools ofMagic, and that the orthodox Levites did not belong to the holy one, is shown in the words pronounced by the dyingJacob. And here it may be well to quote a few sentences from \"Isis Unveiled.\"The dying Jacob thus describes his sons: \"Dan,\" he says, \"shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteththe horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backwards (i.e., he will teach candidates black magic) . . . .

O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly.\"* Now in theoriginal, the words \"their secret\" really are \"their SOD.\"** And Sod was the name for the great mysteries of Baal, Adonisand Bacchus, who were all sun-gods and had serpents for symbols. The Kabalists explain the allegory of the fiery"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"serpents by saying that this was the name given to the tribe of Levi, to all the Levites, in short, and that Moses was thechief of the Sodales.*** It is to the mysteries that the original meaning of the \"Dragon-Slayers\" has to be traced, and thequestion is fully treated of hereafter.Meanwhile it follows that, if Moses was the chief of the Mysteries, he was the Hierophant thereof, and further, if, at thesame time, we find the prophets thundering against the \"abominations\" of the people of Israel, that there were twoschools. \"Fiery serpents\" was, then, simply the epithet given to the Levites of the priestly caste, after they had departedfrom the good law, the traditional teachings of Moses: and to all those who followed Black Magic. Isaiah, when referring tothe \"rebellious children\" who will have to carry their riches into the land whence come \"the viper and fiery flying serpent\"(xxx. 6), or Chaldea and Egypt, whose Initiates had already greatly degenerated in his day (700 B.C.), meant thesorcerers of those lands.**** But these must be carefully distinguished from the \"Fiery Dragons of Wisdom\" and the \"Sonsof the Fire Mist.\"In the \"Great Book of the Mysteries\" we are told that: \"Seven Lords created Seven men; three Lords (Dhyan Chohans orPitris) were holy and good, four less heavenly and full of passion. . . .

Some ancient[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Genesis,\" ch. xlix.** Dunlap, in his introduction to \"Sod, the Mysteries of Adonis,\" explains the word \"Sod\" as arcanum, religious mystery, onthe authority of Schindler's \"Penteglott.\" \"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,\" says Psalm xxv., 14. This is amistranslation of the Christians, for it ought to read \"Sod Ihoh (the mysteries of Ihoh) are for those who fear him\" (Dunlap,\"Mysteries of Adonis,\" xi). \"Al (El) is terrible in the great Sod of the Kadeshim (the priests, the holy, the Initiated), Psalmlxxxix, 7\" (ibid.).

Thus the Mexican local Genesis has \"fourgood men\" described as the four real ancestors of the human race, \"who were neither begotten by the gods nor born ofwoman\"; but whose creation was a wonder wrought by the creative Powers, and who were made only after \"threeattempts at manufacturing men had failed.\" The Egyptians had in their theology only \"four sons of God,\" whereas inPymander seven are given -- thus avoiding any mention of the evil nature of man; though when Seth from a god sank intoSet-Typhon, he began to be called \"the seventh son.\" Whence probably arose the belief that \"the seventh son of theseventh son\" is always a natural-born magician, though, at first, only a sorcerer was meant. APAP, the serpentsymbolizing evil, is slain by Aker, Set's serpent;* therefore Set-Typhon could not be that evil. In the \"Book of the Dead\" itis commanded (v. 13) that chapter clxiii. should be read \"in the presence of a serpent on two legs,\" which means a highInitiate, a Hierophant, for the discus and ram's horns** that adorn his \"serpent's\" head in the hieroglyphics of the title ofthe said chapter denote this. Over the \"serpent\" are represented the two mystic eyes of Ammon,*** the hidden \"mysterygod.\" This passage corroborates our assertion, and shows what the word \"serpent\" meant in antiquity.But as to the Nagals and Nargals, whence came the similarity of names between the Indian Nagas and the AmericanNagals?\"The Nargal was the Chaldean and Assyrian chief of the Magi (Rab-Mag), and the Nagal was the chief sorcerer of theMexican Indians. Both derive their names from Nergal-Serezer, the Assyrian god, and the Hindu Nagas. Both have thesame faculties and the power to have an attendant daemon, with whom they identify themselves completely. TheChaldean and Assyrian Nargal kept his daemon, in the shape of some animal considered sacred, inside the temple; theIndian Nagal keeps his wherever he can -- in the neighbouring lake, or wood, or in the house in the shape of somehousehold animal.\"****Such similarity cannot be attributed to coincidence.

That Arjuna, Krishna's companion and chela, is said to have descended into Patala, the\"antipodes,\" and therein married Ulupi,* a Naga (or Nagini rather), the daughter of the king of the Nagas, Kauravya.**And now it may be hoped the full meaning of the serpent emblem is proven. It is neither that of evil, nor, least of all, thatof the devil; but is, indeed, the [[SEMES EILAM ABRASAX]] (\"the eternal Sun-Abrasax\"), the central spiritual sun of all theKabalists, represented in some diagrams by the circle of Tiphereth.And here, again, we may quote from our earlier volumes and enter into further explanations.\"From this region of unfathomable depth (Bythos, Aditi, Shekinah, the veil of the unknown) issues forth a circle formed ofspirals. This is Tiphereth; which, in the language of symbolism, means a grand cycle, composed of smaller ones. Coiledwithin, so as to follow the spirals, lies the serpent -- emblem of Wisdom and Eternity -- the dual Androgyne; the cyclerepresenting Ennoia, or the divine mind (a power which does not create but which must assimilate), and the serpent, theAgathodaemon, the Ophis, the Shadow of the Light (non-eternal, yet the greatest divine light on our plane). Both were theLogoi of the Ophites: or the Unity as Logos manifesting itself as a double principle of Good and Evil.\"Were it light alone, inactive and absolute, the human mind could not appreciate nor even realise it. Shadow is that whichenables light to manifest itself, and gives it objective reality. Therefore, shadow is not evil, but is the necessary andindispensable corollary which completes Light or Good: it is its creator on Earth.According to the views of the Gnostics, these two principles are immutable Light and Shadow, Good and Evil beingvirtually one and having existed through all eternity, as they will ever continue to exist so long as there are manifestedworlds.This symbol accounts for the adoration by this sect of the Serpent, as the Saviour, coiled either around the sacramentalloaf, or a Tau, the phallic emblem. As a Unity, Ennoia and Ophis are the Logos.

Therefore, we find Ophis urging the first human couple -- the material production of Ilda-Baoth, but which owed its spiritual principle to Sophia-Achamoth -- to eat of the forbidden fruit, although Ophis representsdivine Wisdom.The serpent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree of Life, are all symbols transplanted from the soil ofIndia. The Arasa-Maram, the banyan tree, so sacred with the Hindus (since Vishnu during one of his incarnations,reposed under its mighty shade and there taught human philosophy and sciences), is called the Tree of Knowledge andthe Tree of Life. Under the protecting foliage of this king of the forests, the Gurus teach their pupils their first lessons onimmortality and initiate them into the mysteries of life and death. The Java-Aleim of the Sacerdotal College are said, in theChaldean tradition, to have taught the sons of men to become like one of them. To the present day Foh-tchou,* who livesin his Foh-Maeyu, or temple of Buddha, on the top of the \"Kouin-long-sang,\"** the great mountain, produces his greatestreligious miracles under a tree called in Chinese Sung-Ming-Shu, or the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life, forignorance is death, and knowledge alone gives immortality. This marvellous display takes place every three years, whenan immense concourse of Chinese Buddhists assembles in pilgrimage at the holy place.Now it may become comprehensible why the earliest Initiates and Adepts, or the \"Wise Men,\" for whom it is claimed thatthey were initiated into the mysteries of nature by the UNIVERSAL MIND, represented by the highest angels, werenamed the \"Serpents of Wisdom\" and \"Dragons;\" as also how the first physiologically complete couples -- after beinginitiated into the mystery of human creation through Ophis, the manifested Logos and the androgyne, by eating of the fruitof knowledge -- gradually began to be accused by the material spirit of posterity of having committed Sin, of havingdisobeyed the \"Lord God,\" and of having been tempted by the Serpent.So little have the first Christians (who despoiled the Jews of their Bible) understood the first four chapters of Genesis intheir esoteric meaning, that they never perceived that not only was no sin intended in this disobedience, but that actuallythe \"Serpent\" was \"the Lord God\" himself, who, as the Ophis, the Logos, or the bearer of divine creative wisdom, taughtmankind to become creators in their turn.*** They[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Foh-tchou, literally, in Chinese meaning Buddha's lord, or the teacher of the doctrines of Buddha-Foh.** This mountain is situated south-west of China, almost between China and Tibet."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"*** Let the reader be reminded that in the Zohar, and also in all the Kabalistic works, it is maintained that \"Metatron unitedto Shekinah\" (or Shekinah as the veil (grace) [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 216 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.never realised that the Cross was an evolution from the \"tree and the serpent,\" and thus became the salvation ofmankind. By this it would become the very first fundamental symbol of Creative cause, applying to geometry, to numbers,to astronomy, to measure and to animal reproduction. According to the Kabala the curse on man came with the formationof woman.* The circle was separated from its diameter line. \"From the possession of the double principle in one, that isthe Androgyne condition, the separation of the dual principle was made, presenting two opposites, whose destiny it was,for ever after, to seek reunion into the original one condition. The curse was this, viz.: that nature, impelling the search,evaded the desired result by the production of a new being, distinct from that reunion or oneness desired, by which thenatural longing to recover a lost state was and is for ever being cheated. It is by this tantalizing process of a continuedcurse that Nature lives.\"** (Vide \"Cross and Circle,\" Part II.)The allegory of Adam being driven away from the \"Tree of Life\" means, esoterically, that the newly separated Raceabused and dragged the mystery of Life down into the region of animalism and bestiality. For, as the Zohar shows, thatMatronethah (Shekinah, the wife of Metatron symbolically) \"is the way to the great Tree of Life, the Mighty Tree,\" andShekinah is divine grace. As explained: This Tree reaches the heavenly vale and is hidden between three mountains (theupper triad of principles, in man). From these three mountains, the Tree ascends above (the adept's knowledge aspiresheavenward) and then redescends below (into the adept's Ego on Earth). This Tree is revealed in the day time and ishidden during the night, i.e., revealed to an enlightened mind and hidden to Ignorance, which is night. (See Zohar I., 172,a and b.) \"The Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and the Evil grows from the roots of the Tree of Life.\" (Comm.)

To display this in numbers the values of the letters composing the word Otz ( [[diagram]]),tree, are 7 and 9, the seven being the holy feminine number and the nine the number of the phallic or male energy. Thisansated cross is the symbol of the Egyptian female-male, Isis-Osiris, the germinal principle in all forms, based on theprimal manifestation applicable in all directions and in all senses.\"*This is the Kabalistic view of the Western Occultists, and it differs from the more philosophical Eastern or Aryan viewsupon this subject.** The separation of the sexes was in the programme of nature and of natural evolution; and thecreative faculty in male and female was a gift of Divine wisdom. In the truth of such traditions the whole of antiquity, fromthe patrician philosopher to the humblest spiritually inclined plebeian, has believed. And as we proceed, we maysuccessfully show that the relative truth of such legends, if not their absolute exactness -- vouched for by such giants ofintellect as were Solon, Pythagoras, Plato, and others -- begins to dawn upon more than one modern scientist. He isperplexed; he stands startled and confused before proofs that are being daily accumulated before him; he feels that thereis no way of solving the many historical problems that stare him in the face, unless he begins by accepting ancienttraditions. Therefore, in saying that we believe absolutely in ancient records and universal legends, we need hardly pleadguilty before the impartial observer, for other and far more learned writers, among those who belong to the modernscientific school, evidently believe in much that the Occultists do: e.g., in \"Dragons,\" not only symbolically, but also in theiractual existence at one time.\"It would have indeed been a bold step for anyone, some thirty years ago, to have thought of treating the public to acollection of stories ordinarily reputed fabulous, and of claiming for them the consideration due to genuine realities, or tohave advocated tales, believed to be time-honoured fictions, as actual facts; and those of the nursery as being, in manyinstances, legends, more or less distorted, descriptive of real beings or events. Nowadays it is a less hazardousproceeding . . . . . \"Thus opens the introduction to a recent (1886) and most interesting work by Mr. Charles Gould, called \"MythicalMonsters.\" He boldly states his belief in most of these monsters.

Traditions of creaturesonce co-existing with man, some of which are so weird and terrible as to appear at first sight to be impossible. For me themajor part of those creatures are not chimeras but objects of rational study. The dragon, in place of being a creatureevolved out of the imagination of an Aryan man by the contemplation of lightning flashing through the caverns which hetenanted, as is held by some mythologists, is an animal which once lived and dragged its ponderous coils and perhapsflew. . . . . To me the specific existence of the Unicorn seems not incredible, and in fact, more probable than that theorywhich assigns its origin to a lunar myth* . . . For my part I doubt the general derivation of myths from 'the contemplation ofthe visible workings of external nature.' It seems to me easier to suppose that the palsy of time has enfeebled theutterance of these oft-told tales until their original appearance is almost unrecognisable, than that uncultured savagesshould possess powers of imagination and poetical invention far beyond those enjoyed by the most instructed nations ofthe present day; less hard to believe that these wonderful stories of gods and demigods, of giants and dwarfs, of dragonsand monsters of all descriptions are transformations than to believe them to be inventions.\"**It is shown by the same geologist that man, \"successively traced to periods variously estimated from thirty thousand toone million years . . . . ., co-existed with animals which have long since become extinct (p. 20).\" These animals, \"weirdand terrible,\" were, to give a few instances -- (1) \"Of the genus Cidastes, whose huge bones and vertebrae show them tohave attained a length of nearly two hundred feet . . . . . . \" The remains of such monsters, no less than ten in number,were seen by Professor Marsh in the Mauvaises Terres of Colorado, strewn upon the plains.

But even yet the line has not been reached, and we hear of the discoveryof remains of such titanic proportions as to possess a thigh-bone over twelve feet in length (p. 37).

Is it possible toconceive that, surrounded in Nature with such monstrous creatures, man, unless himself a colossal giant, could havesurvived, while all his foes have perished? Is it with his stone hatchet that he had the best of a Sivatherium or a giganticflying saurian? Let us always bear in mind that at least one great man of science, de Quatrefages, sees no good scientificreasons why man should not have been \"contemporaneous with the earliest mammalia and go back as far as theSecondary Period.\"*\"It appears,\" writes the very conservative Professor Jukes, \"that the flying dragons of romance had something like a realexistence in former ages of the world.\"** \"Does the written history of man,\" the author goes on to ask, \"comprising a fewthousand years, embrace the whole course of his intelligent existence? Or have we in the long mythical eras, extendingover hundreds of thousands of years, and recorded in the chronologies of Chaldea and China, shadowy mementoes ofprehistoric man, handed down by tradition, and perhaps transported by a few survivors to existing lands, from otherswhich, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato, may have been submerged, or the scene of some great catastrophe whichdestroyed them with all their civilization;\" (p. 17).The few remaining giant animals, such as elephants, themselves smaller than their ancestors the Mastodons, andHippopotami, are the only surviving relics, and tend to disappear more entirely with every day. Even they have alreadyhad a few pioneers of their future genus, and have decreased in size in the same proportion as men did. For the remainsof a pigmy elephant were found (E. Falconeri) in the cave deposits of Malta; and the same author asserts that they wereassociated with the remains of pigmy Hippopotami, the former being \"only two feet six inches high; or the still-existingHippopotamus (Choeropsis) Liberiensis, which M. Milne-Edwards figures as little more than two feet in height.\"***Sceptics may smile and denounce our work as full of nonsense or fairy-tales.

An island, which forits unparalleled beauty had no rival in the world, was inhabited by the last remnant of the race which preceded ours.\"\"The last remnant\" meant the \"Sons of Will and Yoga,\" who, with a few tribes, survived the great cataclysm. For it is theThird Race which inhabited the great Lemurian continent, that preceded the veritable and complete human races -- thefourth and the fifth. Therefore it was said in Isis that --\"This race could live with equal ease in water, air, or fire, for it had an unlimited control over the elements. These were the'Sons of God'; not those who saw the daughters of men, but the real Elohim, though in the oriental Kabala they haveanother name. It was they who imparted Nature's most weird secrets to men, and revealed to them the ineffable, and nowlost 'word.' \"The \"Island,\" according to belief, exists to the present hour; now, as an oasis surrounded by the dreadful wildernesses ofthe great Desert, the Gobi -- whose sands \"no foot hath crossed in the memory of man.\"\"This word, which is no word, has travelled once around the globe, and still lingers as a far-off dying echo in the hearts ofsome privileged men. The hierophants of all the Sacerdotal Colleges were aware of the existence of this island; but the'word' was known only to the Java Aleim (Maha Chohan in another tongue), or chief lord of every college, and waspassed to his successor only at the moment of death. There were many such colleges, and the old classic authors speakof them.\"There was no communication with the fair island by sea, but subterranean passages, known only to the chiefs,communicated with it in all directions.\"*Tradition asserts, and archaeology accepts the truth of the legend that there is more than one city now flourishing inIndia, which is built on[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* There are archaeologists, who, like Mr. James Fergusson, deny the great antiquity of even one single monument inIndia. In his work, \"Illustrations of the Rock-Cut Temples of India,\" the author ventures to express the very extraordinaryopinion that \"Egypt had ceased to be a nation before the earliest of the cave-temples of India was excavated.\" In short, hedoes not admit the existence of any cave anterior to the reign of Asoka, and seems anxious to prove that most of theserock-cut temples were executed during a period extending from the time of that pious Buddhist king until the destructionof the Andhra dynasty of Maghada, in the beginning of the fifth century.

Delhi is one of them; Allahabad another-- examples of this being found even in Europe; e.g., in Florence, which is built on several defunct Etruscan and othercities. Why, then, could not Ellora, Elephanta, Karli, and Ajunta have been built on subterranean labyrinths and passages,as claimed? Of course we do not allude to the caves which are known to every European, whether de visu or throughhearsay, notwithstanding their enormous antiquity, though that is so disputed by modern archaeology. But it is a fact,known to the Initiated Brahmins of India and especially to Yogis, that there is not a cave-temple in the country but has itssubterranean passages running in every direction, and that those underground caves and endless corridors have in theirturn their caves and corridors.\"Who can tell that the lost Atlantis -- which is also mentioned in the Secret Book, but, again, under another name,pronounced in the sacred language -- did not exist yet in those days?\" --we went on to ask. It did exist most assuredly, as it was fast approaching its greatest days of glory and civilization whenthe last of the Lemurian continents went down.\"The great lost continent might have, perhaps, been situated south of Asia, extending from India to Tasmania?* If thehypothesis (now so much doubted, and positively denied by some learned authors, who regard it as a joke of Plato's) isever verified, then, perhaps, will the scientists believe that the description of the god-inhabited continent was notaltogether a fable.** And they may then perceive that Plato's guarded hints and his attributing the narrative to Solon andthe Egyptian priests, were but a prudent way of imparting the fact to the world, and, by cleverly combining truth andfiction, so disconnecting himself from a story which the obligations imposed at initiation forbade him to divulge.\"To continue the tradition, we have to add that the class of hierophants was divided into two distinct categories:*** thosewho were instructed by the 'Sons of God,' of the island, and who were initiated in the divine doctrine of pure revelation;and others who inhabited the lost Atlantis -- if such must be its name -- and who, being of another race, (born sexually butof divine parents), were born with a sight, which embraced all living things, and was independent of both distance andmaterial obstacle.

In the \"Histoire des Vierges: Les Peuples et lesContinents Disparus,\" the author says:--\"One of the most ancient legends of India, preserved in the temples by oral and written tradition, relates that severalhundred thousand years ago there existed in the Pacific Ocean an immense continent which was destroyed by geologicalupheaval, and the fragments of which must be sought in Madagascar, Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the principalisles of Polynesia.\"\"The high plateaux of Hindustan and Asia, according to this hypothesis, would only have been represented in thosedistant epochs by great islands contiguous to the central continent . . . . . According to the Brahmans, this country hadattained a high civilization, and the peninsula of Hindustan, enlarged by the displacement of the waters, at the time of thegrand cataclysm, has but continued the chain of the primitive traditions born in this place. These traditions give the nameof Rutas to the peoples which inhabited this immense equinoctial continent, and from their speech was derived theSanscrit. . . . . And the Indo-Hellenic tradition, preserved by the most intelligent population which emigrated from theplains of India, equally relates the existence of a continent and a people to which it gives the name of Atlantis andAtlantides, and which it locates in the Atlantic in the northern portion of the Tropics.\"\"Apart from this fact, the supposition of an ancient continent in those latitudes, the vestiges of which may be found in thevolcanic islands and moun-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 223 THE MAGICIANS OF ATLANTIS.tainous surface of the Azores, the Canaries and Cape de Verdes, is not devoid of geographical probability. The Greeks,who, moreover, never dared to pass beyond the pillars of Hercules, on account of their dread of the mysterious ocean,appeared too late in antiquity for the stories preserved by Plato to be anything else than an echo of the Indian legend.Moreover, when we cast a look on a planisphere, at the sight of the islands and islets strewn from the MalayanArchipelago to Polynesia, from the straits of Sunda to Easter Island, it is impossible, upon the hypothesis of continentspreceding those which we inhabit, not to place there the most important of all.\"A religious belief, common to Malacca and Polynesia, that is to say, to the two opposite extremes of the Oceanic world,affirms 'that all these islands once formed two immense countries, inhabited by yellow men and black men, always at war;and that the gods, wearied with their quarrels, having charged Ocean to pacify them, the latter swallowed up the twocontinents, and, since, it has been impossible to make him give up his captives. Alone, the mountain-peaks and highplateaux escaped the flood, by the power of the gods, who perceived too late the mistake they had committed.'\"Whatever there may be in these traditions, and whatever may have been the place where a civilization more ancientthan that of Rome, of Greece, of Egypt, and of India was developed, it is certain that this civilization did exist, and it ishighly important to science to recover its traces, however feeble and fugitive they may be\" (pp. 13-15).This last tradition corroborates the one given from the \"Records of the Secret Doctrine.\" The war mentioned between theyellow and the black men, relates to a struggle between the \"sons of God\" and the \"sons of giants,\" or the inhabitants andmagicians of Atlantis."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The final conclusion of the author, who personally visited all the islands of Polynesia, and devoted years to the study ofthe religion, language, and traditions of nearly all the peoples, is as follows:\"As to the Polynesian continent which disappeared at the time of the final geological cataclysms, its existence rests onsuch proofs that to be logical we can doubt no longer.\"The three summits of this continent, the Sandwich Islands, New Zealand, Easter Island, are distant from each other fromfifteen to eighteen hundred leagues, and the groups of intermediate islands, Viti, Samoa, Tonga, Foutouna, Ouvea, theMarquesas, Tahiti, Poumoutou, the Gambiers, are themselves distant from these extreme points from seven or eighthundred to one thousand leagues.\"All navigators agree in saying that the extreme and the central groups could never have communicated in view of theiractual geographical position, and with the insufficient means they had at hand. It is physically impossible to cross suchdistances in a pirogue . . . without a compass, and travel months without provisions.\"On the other hand, the aborigines of the Sandwich Islands, of Viti, of New Zealand, of the central groups, of Samoa,Tahiti, etc., had never known each other, had never heard of each other, before the arrival of the Europeans.

And all to thequestion, 'Where is the cradle of your race?' for sole response, extended their hand toward the setting sun\" (Ibid., p. 308).Geographically, this description clashes slightly with the facts in the Secret Records; but it shows the existence of suchtraditions, and this is all one cares for. For, as there is no smoke without fire, so a tradition must be based on someapproximate truth.In its proper place we will show modern Science fully corroborating the above and the traditions of the Secret Doctrinewith regard to the two lost continents. The Easter Island relics are, for instance, the most astounding and eloquentmemorials of the primeval giants. They are as grand as they are mysterious; and one has but to examine the heads of thecolossal statues, that have remained unbroken on that island, to recognise in them at a glance the features of the typeand character attributed to the Fourth Race giants. They seem of one cast though different in features -- that of adistinctly sensual type, such as the Atlanteans (the Daityas and \"Atalantians\") are represented to have in the esotericHindu books. Compare these with the faces of some other colossal statues in Central Asia -- those near Bamian forinstance -- the portrait-statues, tradition tells us, of Buddhas belonging to previous Manvantaras; of those Buddhas andheroes who are mentioned in the Buddhist and Hindu works, as men of fabulous size,* the good and holy brothers of theirwicked co-uterine brothers generally, as Ravana, the giant King of Lanka was the brother of Kumbhakarna; alldescendants of the gods through the Rishis, and thus, like \"Titan and his enormous brood,\" all \"heaven's first born.\"These \"Buddhas,\" though often spoilt by the symbolical representation of the great pendent ears, show a suggestivedifference, perceived at a glance, between the expression of their faces and that of the Easter Isle statues. They may beof one race -- but the former are \"Sons of Gods\"; the latter the brood of mighty sorcerers. All these are re-incarnations,however, and apart from unavoidable exaggerations in popular fancy and tradition, they are historical characters.** Whendid they live?

We are assured by the Orientalists that chronology is both hopelessly mixed and absurdly exaggerated inthe Puranas and other Hindu Scriptures. We feel quite prepared to agree with the accusation. Yet, if Aryan writers didallow their chronological pendulum to swing too far one way occasionally, beyond the legitimate limit of fact; nevertheless,when the distance of that deviation is compared with the distance of the Orientalists' deviation in the opposite direction,moderation will be found on the Brahminical side. It is the Pundit who will in the long run be found more truthful andnearer to fact than the Sanskritist. Surely, it is not because the curtailing of the latter -- even when proven to have beenresorted to in order to fit a personal hobby -- is regarded by Western public opinion as \"a cautious acceptance of facts,\"whereas the Pundit is brutally treated in print as a liar, that everyone has to see this in the same light. An impartialobserver may judge it otherwise. He may either proclaim both unscrupulous historians, or justify both, each on hisrespective ground, and say: Hindu Aryans wrote for their Initiates, who read truth between the lines, not for the masses. Ifthey did mix up events and confuse Ages intentionally, it was not in view of deceiving any one, but to preserve theirknowledge from the prying eye of the foreigner. Otherwise, to him who can count the generations from the Manus, andthe series of incarnations specified in the cases of some heroes,* the meaning and chronological order are very clear inthe Puranas. As for the Western Orientalist, he must be excused, on account of his undeniable ignorance of the methodsused by archaic Esotericism.But such existing prejudices will have to give way and disappear very soon before the light of new discoveries.

This Oannes, to whom, thanks only to the Biblical Deluge, an antiquity of hardly1,500 B.C. had been hitherto allowed, is now spoken of in these terms:--\"His city was Eridu, which stood 6,000 years ago on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The name means 'the good city,' aparticularly holy spot, since it was the centre from which the earliest Chaldean civilization made its way to the north. Asthe culture-god was represented as coming from the sea, it was possible that the culture of which Eridu was the seat wasof foreign importation. We now know that there was intercourse at a very early period between Chaldea and the Sinaiticpeninsula, as well as with India. The statues discovered by the French at Tel-loh (dating from at latest B.C. 4,000) weremade of the extremely hard stone known as diorite, and the inscriptions on them stated the diorite to have been broughtfrom Mazan -- i.e., the Sinaitic peninsula, which was then ruled by the Pharaohs. The statues are known to resemble ingeneral style the diorite statue, Kephren, the builder of the second Pyramid, while, according to Mr. Petrie, the unit ofmeasurement marked on the plan of the city, which one of the Tel-loh figures holds on his lap, is the same as thatemployed by the Pyramid builders.

These were those early conscious Beings who, now adding conscious knowledge and will to their inherentDivine purity, created by Kriyasakti the semi-Divine man, who became the seed on earth for future adepts. Those, on theother hand, who, jealous of their intellectual freedom (unfettered as it then was by the bonds of matter), said:-- \"We canchoose . . . we have wisdom\" (See verse 24), and incarnated far later -- these had their first Karmic punishment preparedfor them. They got bodies (physiologically) inferior to their astral models, because their chhayas had belonged toprogenitors of an inferior degree in the seven classes. As to those \"Sons of Wisdom\" who had \"deferred\" their incarnationtill the Fourth Race, which was already tainted (physiologically) with sin and impurity, they produced a terrible cause, theKarmic result of which weighs on them to this day. It was produced in themselves, and they became the carriers of thatseed of iniquity for aeons to come, because the bodies they had to inform had become defiled through their ownprocrastination. (See verses 32, 36.)This was the \"Fall of the angels,\" because of their rebellion against Karmic Law. The \"fall of man\" was no fall, for he wasirresponsible. But \"Creation\" having been invented on the dualistic system as the \"prerogative of God alone,\" thelegitimate attribute patented by theology in the name of an infinite deity of their own making, this power had to beregarded as \"Satanic,\" and as an usurpation of divine rights. Thus, the foregoing, in the light of such narrow views, mustnaturally be considered as a terrible slander on man, \"created in the image of God,\" a still more dreadful blasphemy in theface of the dead-letter dogma. \"Your doctrine,\" the Occultists were already told, \"makes of man, created out of dust in thelikeness of his God, a vehicle of the Devil, from the first.\" \"Why did you make of your god a devil -- both, moreover,created in your own image?\" is our reply. The esoteric interpretation of the Bible, however, sufficiently refutes thisslanderous invention of theology; the Secret Doctrine must some day become the just Karma of the Churches -- moreanti-Christian than the representative assemblies of the most confirmed Materialists and Atheists.The old doctrine about the true meaning of the \"Fallen Angels,\" in its anthropological and evolutionary sense, is containedin the Kabala,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 229 THE MYSTERIES AMONG THE MAYAS.and explains the Bible. It is found pre-eminent in Genesis when the latter is read in a spirit of research for truth, with noeye to dogma, and in no mood of preconception. This is easily proven. In Genesis (vi.) the \"Sons of God\" -- B'ne Aleim --become enamoured of the daughters of men, marry, and reveal to their wives the mysteries unlawfully learnt by them inheaven, according to Enoch; and this is the \"Fall of Angels.\"* But what is, in reality, the \"Book of Enoch\" itself, from whichthe author of Revelation and even the St. John of the Fourth Gospel have so profusely quoted? (e.g., verse 8, in chapter10, about all who have come before Jesus, being \"thieves and robbers.\") Simply a Book of Initiation, giving out in allegoryand cautious phraseology the programme of certain archaic mysteries performed in the inner temples. The author of the\"Sacred Mysteries among the Mayas and Quiches\" very justly suggests that the so-called \"Visions\" of Enoch relate to his(Enoch's) experience at initiation, and what he learned in the mysteries; while he very erroneously states his opinion thatEnoch had learned them before being converted[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In general, the so-called orthodox Christian conceptions about the \"fallen\" angels or Satan, are as remarkable as theyare absurd. About a dozen could be cited, of the most various character as to details, and all from the pen of educated layauthors, \"University graduates\" of the present quarter of our century. Thus, the author of \"Earth's Earliest Ages,\" J. H.Pember, M.A., devotes a thick volume to proving Theosophists, Spiritualists, Metaphysicians, Agnostics, Mystics, poets,and every contemporary author on oriental speculations, to be the devoted servants of the \"Prince of the Air,\" andirretrievably damned. He describes Satan and his Antichrist in this wise:--\"Satan is the 'Anointed Cherub' of old. . . . God created Satan, the fairest and wisest of all his creatures in this part of HisUniverse, and made him Prince of the World, and of the Power of the Air. . . . He was placed in an Eden, which was bothfar anterior to the Eden of Genesis. . . . and of an altogether different and more substantial character, resembling the NewJerusalem. Thus, Satan being perfect in wisdom, and beauty, His vast empire is our earth, if not the whole solar system. .. . Certainly no other angelic power of greater or even equal dignity has been revealed to us. The Archangel Michaelhimself is quoted by Jude as preserving towards the Prince of Darkness the respect due to a superior, however wicked hemay be, until God has formally commanded his deposition.\" Then we are informed that \"Satan was from the moment ofhis creation surrounded by the insignia of royalty\" (! !): that he \"awoke to consciousness to find the air filled with therejoicing music of those whom God had appointed . . . .\" Then the Devil \"passes from the royalty to his priestly dignity\" (! !!) \"Satan was also a priest of the Most High,\" etc., etc. And now -- \"Antichrist will be Satan incarnate\" (pp. 56-59). ThePioneers of the coming Apollyon have already appeared -- they are the Theosophists, the Occultists, the authors of the\"Perfect Way,\" of \"Isis Unveiled,\" of the \"Mystery of the Ages,\" and even of the \"Light of Asia\"! ! The author notes the\"avowed origin\" (of Theosophy) from the \"descending angels,\" from the \"Nephilim,\" or the angels of the VIth ch. ofGenesis, and the Giants. He ought to note his own descent from them also, as the present Secret Doctrine endeavours toshow -- unless he refuses to belong to the present humanity.------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 2, Page]] 230 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.to Christianity (!!); furthermore, he believes that this book was written \"at the beginning of the Christian era, when . . . thecustoms and religion of the Egyptians fell into decadency\"! This is hardly possible, since Jude quotes in his epistle fromthe \"Book of Enoch\" (verse 14); and, therefore, as Archbishop Laurence, the translator of the Book of Enoch from theEthiopic version, remarks, it \"could not have been the production of a writer who lived after . . . or was even coeval with\"the writers of the New Testament: unless, indeed, Jude and the Gospels, and all that follows, was also a production of thealready established Church -- which, some critics say, is not impossible. But we are now concerned with the \"fallenAngels\" of Enoch, rather than with Enoch himself.In Indian exotericism, these angels (Asuras) are also denounced as \"the enemies of the gods;\" those who opposesacrificial worship offered to the latter. In Christian theology they are broadly referred to as the \"Fallen Spirits,\" the heroesof various conflicting and contradictory legends about them, gathered from Pagan sources. The coluber tortuosus \"thetortuous snake,\" a qualification said to have originated with the Jews, had quite another meaning before the RomanChurch distorted it:-- among others, a purely astronomical meaning.The \"Serpent\" fallen from on high, \"deorsum fluens,\" was credited with the possession of the Keys of the Empire of theDead, [[tou thanatus arche]] to that day, when Jesus saw it \"falling like lightning from heaven\" (Luke x. 17, 18), theRoman Catholic interpretation of cadebat ut fulgur to the contrary, notwithstanding; and it means indeed that even \"thedevils are subject\" to the Logos -- who is WISDOM, but who, as the opponent of ignorance, is Satan or Lucifer at thesame time. This remark refers to divine Wisdom falling like lightning on, and quickening the intellects of those who fightthe devils of ignorance and superstition. Up to the time when Wisdom, in the shape of the incarnating Spirits of MAHAT,descended from on high to animate and call the Third Race to real conscious life, humanity -- if it can be so called in itsanimal, senseless state --was of course doomed to -- moral as well as to physical death. The Angels fallen intogeneration are referred to metaphorically as Serpents and Dragons of Wisdom. On the other hand, regarded in the light ofthe LOGOS, the Christian Saviour, like Krishna, whether as man or logos, may be said to have saved those who believedin the secret teachings from \"eternal death,\" to have conquered the Kingdom of Darkness, or Hell, as every Initiate does.This in the human, terrestrial form of the Initiates, and also because the logos is Christos, that principle of our inner naturewhich develops in us into the Spiritual Ego -- the Higher-Self -- being formed of the indissoluble union of Buddhi (thesixth) and the spiritual efflorescence of Manas, the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 231 SATANIC MYTHS.fifth principle.* \"The Logos is passive Wisdom in Heaven and Conscious, Self-Active Wisdom on Earth,\" we are taught. Itis the Marriage of \"Heavenly man\" with the \"Virgin of the World\" --Nature, as described in Pymander; the result of which istheir progeny -- immortal man. It is this which is called in St. John's Revelation the marriage of the lamb with his bride.(xix. 7.) That \"wife\" is now identified with the Church of Rome owing to the arbitrary interpretations of her votaries. Butthey seem to forget that her linen may be fine and white outwardly (like the \"whitened sepulchre\"), but that the rottennessshe is inwardly filled with, is not \"the righteousness of Saints\" (v. 8. ibid), but rather the blood of the Saints she has \"slainupon the earth\" (chap. xviii. 24.) Thus the remark made by the great Initiate (in Luke x. 18) -- one that referredallegorically to the ray of Enlightenment and reason, falling like lightning from on high into the hearts and minds of theconverts to that old wisdom-religion then presented in a new form by the wise Galilean Adeptt** -- was distorted out ofrecognition (as was his own personality), and made to fit in with one of the most cruel as the most pernicious of alltheological dogmas. (Vide at the end of Stanza XI. \"SATANIC MYTHS.\")But if Western theology alone holds the patent for, and copyright of SATAN -- in all the dogmatic horror of that fiction --other nationalities[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is not correct to refer to Christ -- as some theosophists do -- as the sixth principle in man -- Buddhi. The latter per se isa passive and latent principle, the spiritual vehicle of Atman, inseparable from the manifested Universal Soul. It is only inunion and in conjunction with Self-consciousness that Buddhi becomes the Higher Self and the divine, discriminatingSoul. Christos is the seventh principle, if anything.** To make it plainer, any one who reads that passage in Luke, will see that the remark follows the report of the seventy,who rejoice that \"even the devils (the spirit of controversy and reasoning, or the opposing power, since Satan meanssimply \"adversary\" or opponent) are subject unto us through thy name.\" (Luke x. 17.) Now, \"thy name\" means the nameof Christos, or Logos, or the spirit of true divine wisdom, as distinct from the spirit of intellectual or mere materialisticreasoning -- the HIGHER SELF in short. And when Jesus remarks to this that he has \"beheld Satan as lightning fall fromheaven,\" it is a mere statement of his clairvoyant powers, notifying them that he already knew it, and a reference to theincarnation of the divine ray (the gods or angels) which falls into generation. For not all men, by any means, benefit bythat incarnation, and with some the power remains latent and dead during the whole life. Truly \"No man knoweth who theSon is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son\" as added by Jesus then and there (Ibid v. 22) -- the Church \"ofChrist\" less than any one else. The Initiates alone understood the secret meaning of the term \"Father and the Son,\" andknew that it referred to Spirit and Soul on the Earth. For the teachings of Christ were occult teachings, which could onlybe explained at the initiation. They were never intended for the masses, for Jesus forbade the twelve to go to the Gentilesand the Samaritans (Matt. x. 8), and repeated to his disciples that the \"mysteries of Heaven\" were for them alone, not forthe multitudes (Mark iv. 11).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 232 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and religions have committed equal errors in their misinterpretation of this tenet, which is one of the most profoundlyphilosophical and ideal conceptions of ancient thought. For they have both disfigured and hinted at the correct meaning ofit in their numerous allegories touching the subject. Nor have the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"semi-esoteric dogmas of Puranic Hinduism failed to evolve very suggestive symbols and allegories concerning therebellious and fallen gods. The Puranas teem with them; and we find a direct hint at the truth in the frequent allusions ofParasara (Vishnu Purana), to all those Rudras, Rishis, Asuras, Kumaras and Munis, having to be born in every age, to re-incarnate in every Manvantara. This (esoterically) is equivalent to saying that the FLAMES born of the Universal Mind(Mahat), owing to the mysterious workings of Karmic Will and an impulse of Evolutionary Law, had, as in Pymander --without any gradual transition -- landed on this Earth, having broken through the seven Circles of fire, or the sevenintermediate Worlds, in short.There is an eternal cyclic law of re-births, and the series is headed at every new Manvantaric dawn by those who hadenjoyed their rest from re-incarnations in previous Kalpas for incalculable AEons -- by the highest and the earliestNirvanees. It was the turn of those \"Gods\" to incarnate in the present Manvantara; hence their presence on Earth, and theensuing allegories; hence, also, the perversion of the original meaning.* The Gods who had fallen into generation, whosemission it was to complete divine man, are found represented later on as Demons, evil Spirits, and fiends, at feud andwar with Gods, or the irresponsible agents of the one Eternal law. But no conception of such creatures as the devils andSatan of the Christian, Jewish, and Mahomedan religions was ever intended under those thousand and one Aryanallegories.** (See \"The Fallen Angels\" and \"The Mystic Dragons\" in Part II.)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* So, for instance, in the Puranas, \"Pulastya,\" a Prajapati, or son of Brahma -- the progenitor of the Rakshasas, and thegrandfather of Ravana, the Great King of Lanka (see Ramayana) -- had, in a former birth, a son named Dattoli, \"who isnow known as the sage Agastya\" -- says Vishnu Purana. This name of Dattoli alone, has six more variants to it, or sevenmeanings. He is called respectively, Dattoi, Dattali, Dattotti, Dattotri, Dattobhri, Dambhobhi and Dambholi -- which sevenvariants have each a secret sense, and refer in the esoteric comments to various ethnological classifications, and also tophysiological and anthropological mysteries of the primitive races. For, surely, the Rakshasas are not demons, but simplythe primitive and ferocious giants, the Atlanteans, who were scattered on the face of the globe as the Fifth Race is now.Vasishta is a warrant to this, if his words addressed to Parasara, who attempted a bit of JADOO (sorcery), which he calls\"sacrifice,\" for the destruction of the Rakshasas, mean anything. For he says, \"Let no more of these unoffending 'SpiritsDarkness' be destroyed.\" (see for details Adiparvan, s. 176, Mahabharata; also the Linga Purana \"Purvardha,\" s. 64.)** We have a passage from a Master's letter which has a direct bearing upon these [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 233 HOLY SATAN.The true esoteric view about \"Satan,\" the opinion held on this subject by the whole philosophic antiquity, is admirablybrought out in an appendix, entitled \"The Secret of Satan,\" to the second edition of Dr. A. Kingsford's \"Perfect Way.\" Nobetter and clearer indication of the truth could be offered to the intelligent reader, and it is therefore quoted here at somelength:--\"1. And on the seventh day (seventh creation of the Hindus),* there went forth from the presence of God a mighty Angel,full of wrath and consuming, and God gave him the dominion of the outermost sphere.**2. \"Eternity brought forth Time; the Boundless gave birth to Limit; Being descended into generation.\"***4. \"Among the Gods is none like unto him, into whose hands are committed the kingdoms, the power and the glory of theworlds:\"5. \"Thrones and empires, the dynasties of kings,**** the fall of nations, the birth of churches, the triumph of Time.\"For, as is said in Hermes, \"Satan is the door-keeper of the Temple of the King; he standeth in Solomon's porch; heholdeth the key of the Sanctuary, that no man enter therein, save the Anointed having the arcanum of Hermes\" (v. 20 and21).These suggestive and majestic verses had reference with the ancient Egyptians and other civilized peoples of antiquity tothe creative and generative light of the Logos (Horus, Brahma, Ahura-Mazda, etc., etc., as primeval manifestations of theever-unmanifested Principle, e.g., Ain-Soph, Parabrahm, or Zeruana Akerne-- Boundless Time -- Kala), but the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] incarnating angels. Says the letter: \"Now there are, and there must be, failuresin the ethereal races of the many classes of Dhyan-Chohans, or Devas (progressed entities of a previous planetaryperiod), as well as among men. But still, as the failures are too far progressed and spiritualized to be thrown back forciblyfrom Dhyan-Chohanship into the vortex of a new primordial evolution through the lower Kingdoms, this then happens.Where a new solar system has to be evolved these Dhyan-Chohans are borne in by influx 'ahead' of the Elementals(Entities . . . to be developed into humanity at a future time) and remain as a latent or inactive spiritual force, in the auraof a nascent world . . . until the stage of human evolution is reached. . . .

The \"Anointed,\" who has the secrets and mysteries of Hermes (Buddha,Wisdom), and who alone is entrusted with the key to the \"Sanctuary,\" the Womb of nature, in order to fructify it and call toactive life and being the whole Kosmos, has become, with the Jews, Jehovah, the \"God of generation\" on the lunarmountain (Sinai, the mountain of the moon, \"Sin\"). The \"Sanctuary\" has become the \"Holy of Holies,\" and the arcanumhas been anthropomorphised and phallicised and dragged down into matter, indeed. Hence arose the necessity ofmaking of the \"Dragon of Wisdom,\" the Serpent of Genesis: of the conscious god who needed a body to clothe his toosubjective divinity, Satan. But the \"innumerable incarnations of Spirit,\" and \"the ceaseless pulse and current of desire\"refer, the first one, to our doctrine of Karmic and cyclic rebirths, the second -- to EROS, not the later god of material,physiological love, but to the divine desire in the gods, as well as in all nature, to create and give life to Beings. This, theRays of the one \"dark,\" because invisible and incomprehensible, FLAME could achieve only by themselves descendinginto matter. Therefore, as continued in the APPENDIX:12. \"Many names hath God given him (Satan), names of mystery, secret and terrible.\"13. \"The Adversary, because matter opposeth Spirit. Time accuseth even the Saints of the Lord.\" 28, 29, 31. \"Stand in awe of him, and sin not; speak his name with trembling . . . . For Satan is the magistrate of thejustice of God (Karma); he beareth the balance and the sword . . . . For to him are committed Weight and Measure andNumber.\"Compare the last sentence with what the Rabbi, who explains the Kabala to Prince Al-Chazari in the Book of that name,says; and it will be found that the Weight and Measure and Number are, in Sepher Jezirah, the attributes of the Sephiroth(the three Sephrim, or figures, ciphers) covering the whole collective number of 10; and that the Sephiroth are thecollective Adam Kadmon, the \"Heavenly Man\" or the Logos. Thus Satan and the anointed were identified in ancientthought. Therefore,33. \"Satan is the minister of God, Lord of the seven mansions of Hades\" . . . .The seven or Saptaloka of the Earth with the Hindus; for Hades, or the Limbo of Illusion, of which theology makes aregion bordering on Hell, is simply our globe, the Earth, and thus Satan is called -- 33 \". . . . the angel of the manifest Worlds.\"It is \"Satan who is the god of our planet and the only god,\" and this without any allusive metaphor to its wickedness anddepravity.

And now we approach the \"Secret of Satan.\"37, 38, 39. \" . . . Upon Satan only is the shame of generation. He hath lost his virginal estate (so hath the Kumara byincarnating): uncovering heavenly secrets, he hath entered into bondage. . . . He compasseth with bonds and limits allthings. . . .\"42, 43, 44. \"Twain are the armies of God: in heaven the hosts of Michael; in the abyss (the manifested world) the legionsof Satan.

(Vide Part II., \"Is Pleroma Satan's Lair?\")When the Church, therefore, curses Satan, it curses the cosmic reflection of God; it anathematizes God made manifest inmatter or in the objective; it maledicts God, or the ever-incomprehensible WISDOM, revealing itself as Light and Shadow,good and evil in nature, in the only manner comprehensible to the limited intellect of MAN.This is the true philosophical and metaphysical interpretation of Samael, or Satan, the adversary in the Kabala; the sametenets and spirit being found in the allegorical interpretations of every other ancient religion. This philosophical view doesnot interfere, however, with the historical records connected with it. We say \"historical,\" because allegory and a mythicalornamentation around the kernel of tradition, in no wise prevent that kernel being a record of real events. Thus, theKabala, repeating the time-honoured revelations of the once universal history of our globe and the evolution of its races,has presented it under the legendary form of the various records which have formed the Bible. Its historical foundation isnow offered, in however imperfect a form, on these pages from the Secret Doctrine of the East; and thus"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 236 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the allegorical and symbolical meaning of the Serpent of Genesis is found explained by the \"Sons of Wisdom\" (or angelsfrom higher spheres, though all and each pertain to the kingdom of Satan, or Matter) revealing to men the mysteries ofHeaven. Hence, also, all the so-called myths of the Hindu, Grecian, Chaldean, and Jewish Pantheons are found to bebuilt on fact and truth. The giants of Genesis are the historical Atlanteans of Lanka, and the Greek Titans.Who can forget that Troy was once upon a time proclaimed a myth, and Homer a non-existing personage, while theexistence of such cities as Herculaneum and Pompeii was denied, and attributed to mere fairy legends? Yet Schliemannproved that Troy had really existed, and the two cities, though buried for long ages under the Vesuvian lava, have hadtheir resurrection day, and live again on the surface of the earth. How many more cities and localities called \"fabulous\"are on the list of future discoveries, how many more personages regarded as mythical* will one day become historical,those alone can tell who read the decrees of Fate in the astral light.As the tenets of the Eastern doctrine, however, have always been kept secret, and as the reader can hardly hope to beshown the original texts unless he becomes an accepted disciple, let the Greek and Latin scholar turn to the original textsof Hermetic literature. Let him, for one thing, read carefully the opening pages of the Pymander of Hermes Trismegistus;and then he will see our doctrines corroborated in it, however veiled its text. There also he will find the evolution of theUniverse, of our Earth (called \"Nature\" in Pymander) as of everything else, from the \"Moyst Principle\" -- or the greatDeep, FATHER-MOTHER -- the first differentiation in the manifested Kosmos. First the \"Universal Mind,\" which the handof the Christian translator has metamorphosed in the earliest renderings into God, the Father: then the \"Heavenly Man,\"**which is the great Total of that Host of Angels, which was too pure for the creation of the inferior worlds or of the men ofour globe, but which fell nevertheless into matter by virtue of that same evolution, as the second logos of the \"Father.\"***[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See the \"Primeval Manus of Humanity.\"** The \"Heavenly Man\" -- please mark again the word -- is \"the LOGOS\" or the \"Son\" esoterically. Therefore, once thatthe title was applied to Christ (declared God and the very God himself) Christian theology had no choice. In order tosupport its dogma of the personal Trinity it had to proclaim, as it does, that the Christian Logos is the only true one, andthat all the Logoi of other religions were false, and only the masquerading Evil Principles, SATAN. Now see where this ledWestern theology to.*** \"For the Mind, a deity abounding in both sexes, being Life and Life, brought forth by its Word another Mind orWorkman; which, being God of the Fire and the Spirit, fashioned and formed seven other Governors, which in their circlescontain the [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 237 MAHASURA AND SATAN.Synthetically every Creative Logos, or \"the Son who is one with the Father,\" is the Host of the Rectores Mundi in itself.Even Christian theology makes of the seven \"Angels of the Presence\" the Virtues, or the personified attributes of God,which, being created by him, as the Manus were by Brahma, became Archangels. The Roman Catholic theodice itselfrecognising, in its creative Verbum Princeps, the head of those angels -- caput angelorum -- and the magni consiliiAngelus (the Angel of the great Counsel), thus recognizes the identity of Christ and those Angels.\"The Gods became no-Gods, the Sura -- A-sura,\" says the text; i.e., gods became fiends -- SATAN, when read literally.But Satan will now be shown, in the teaching of the Secret Doctrine, allegorized as Good, and Sacrifice, a God ofWisdom, under different names.The Kabala teaches that Pride and Presumption -- the two chief prompters of Selfishness and Egotism -- are the causesthat emptied heaven of one third of its divine denizens -- mystically, and of one third of the stars -- astronomically; in otherwords, the two statements are -- the first an allegory, and the second a fact. The former, nevertheless, as shown, isintimately connected with humanity.In their turn the Rosicrucians, who were well acquainted with the secret meaning of the tradition, kept it to themselves,teaching merely that the whole of creation was due to, and the result of, that legendary \"War in Heaven\" brought on bythe rebellion of the angels* against creative law, or the Demiurge. The statement is correct, but the inner meaning is tothis day a mystery. To elude further explanation of the difficulty by appealing to divine mystery, or to the sin of prying intoits policy -- is to say nothing at all. It may prove sufficient to[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Phenomenal World, and whose disposition is called Fate or Destiny.\" (Section9, ch. I, ed. of 1579).Here it is evident that \"Mind\" (the primeval universal Divine Thought) is neither the Unknown unmanifested One, since itabounds in both sexes (is male and female), nor yet the Christian Father, as the latter is a male and not an androgyne.The fact is that the Father, Son, and Man are hopelessly mixed up in the translations of Pymander.* The allegory of the fire of Prometheus is another version of the rebellion of the proud Lucifer, who was hurled down tothe bottomless pit, or simply unto our Earth, to live as man. The Hindu Lucifer, the Mahasura, is also said to have becomeenvious of the Creator's resplendent light, and, at the head of inferior Asuras (not gods, but spirits), to have rebelledagainst Brahma; for which Siva hurled him down to Patala. But, as philosophy goes hand in hand with allegorical fiction inHindu myths, the devil is made to repent, and is afforded the opportunity to progress: he is a sinful man esoterically, andcan by yoga devotion, and adeptship, reach his status of one with the deity, once more.

Yet the truth, although known to most ofthe higher Kabalists, has never been told by any of their number. One and all, Kabalists and symbologists, showed anextraordinary reluctance to confess the primitive meaning of the Fall of the Angels. In a Christian such silence is onlynatural. Neither alchemist nor philosopher could, during the Mediaeval Ages, utter that* which in the sight of orthodoxtheology was a terrible blasphemy, for it would have led them directly through the \"Holy\" office of the Inquisition, to stakeand rack. But for our modern Kabalists and Freethinkers the case is different. With the latter, we fear, it is merely humanpride, vanity based on a loudly rejected and as ineradicable superstition. Since the Church, in her struggle withManichaeism, invented the devil, and by placing[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Why should, for instance, Eliphas Levi, the very fearless and outspoken Kabalist, have hesitated to divulge the mysteryof the Fallen Angels so-called? That he knew the fact and real meaning of the allegory -- both in its religious and mystical,as well as in its physiological sense -- is proved by his voluminous writings and frequent allusions and hints. Yet Eliphas,after having alluded to it a hundred times in his previous works, says in his latest \"Histoire de la Magie,\" p. 220 . . . \"Weprotest with all our might against the sovereignty and the ubiquity of Satan. We pretend neither to deny nor affirm herethe tradition on the Fall of the Angels . . . but if so, then the prince of the Angelic Rebels can be at best the last and themost powerless among the condemned -- now that he is separated from deity -- which is the principle of every power. . ..\" This is hazy and evasive enough; but see what Hargrave Jennings writes in his weird, staccato-like style:--\"Both Saint Michael and Saint George are types. They are sainted personages, or dignified heroes, or powersapotheosized. They are each represented with their appropriate faculties and attributes. These are reproduced and standmultiplied -- distinguished by different names in all the mythologies . . . (including the Christian). . . . The idea regardingeach is a general one. This idea and representative notion is that of the all-powerful champion -- child-like in his 'Virgininnocence' -- so powerful that this god-filled innocence (the Seraphim 'Know most,' the Cherubim 'love most') can shatterthe world (articulated, so to use the word -- in the magic of Lucifer, but condemned) in opposition to the artfulconstructions (this 'side-life') of the magnificent apostate, the mighty rebel, but yet at the same time the 'Light-bringer,' theLucifer, the 'Morning Star,' the 'Son of the morning' -- the very highest title 'out of heaven, 'for in heaven it cannot be, butout of heaven it is everything.

This is another. . . 'myth within myths' . . . a stupendous 'mystery of mysteries,' because it is so impossible and contradictory.Unexplainable as the Apocalypse. Unrevealable as the 'Revelation' \"(p. 213).Nevertheless, this unexplainable and unrevealable mystery will now be explained and revealed by the doctrines of theEast. But as the very erudite, but still more puzzling author of \"Phallicism\" gives it, of course, no uninitiated mortal wouldever understand the real drift of his remarks.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 239 THEOLOGICAL SNUFFERS.a theological extinguisher on the radiant star-god, Lucifer, the \"Son of the Morning,\" thus created the most gigantic of allher paradoxes -- a black and tenebrous light -- the myth has struck its roots too deep in the soil of blind faith to permit, inour age, even those, who do not acquiesce in her dogmas and laugh at her horned and cloven-footed Satan, to come outbravely and confess the antiquity of the oldest of all traditions. In a few brief words it is this. Semi-exoterically, the \"First-born\" of the Almighty -- Fiat Lux, -- or the angels of primordial light, were commanded to create; one third of them rebelledand refused; while those who \"obeyed as Fetahil did -- failed\" most signally.To realise the refusal and failure in their correct physical meaning, one must study and understand Eastern philosophy;one has to be acquainted with the fundamental mystical tenets of the Vedantins, with regard to the utter fallacy ofattributing functional activity to the infinite and absolute deity. Esoteric philosophy maintains that during the Sandhyas, the\"Central Sun\" emits creative light -- passively so to say. Causality is latent. It is only during the active periods of being thatit gives rise to a stream of ceaseless energy, whose vibrating currents acquire more activity and potency with every rungof the hebdomadic ladder of Being which they descend. Hence it becomes comprehensible how the process of creating,or rather of fashioning, the organic Universe, with all its units of the seven kingdoms, necessitated intelligent beings --who became collectively a Being or creative God -- differentiated already from the one absolute Unity, unrelated as thelatter is to conditioned creation.*Now the Vatican MSS. of the Kabala -- a single copy of which (in Europe) is said to have been in the possession of CountSt. Germain -- contains the most complete exposition of the doctrine, including the peculiar version accepted by theLuciferians** and other Gnostics; and in that parchment the Seven Suns of Life are given in the order they are found inthe Saptasurya. Only four of these, however, are mentioned in the editions of the Kabala which are procurable in thepublic libraries, and that even in a more or less veiled phraseology. Nevertheless even this reduced number is amplysufficient to show an identical origin, as it refers to the quaternary group of the Dhyan-Chohans, and proves thespeculation to have had its origin in the Secret Doctrines of the Aryans.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Creation\" -- out of pre-existent eternal substance, or matter, of course, which substance, according to our teachings, isboundless, ever-existing space."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"** The Luciferians -- the sect of the fourth century who are alleged to have taught that the Soul was a carnal bodytransmitted to the child by its father; -- and that other religious and still earlier sect of the second century A.D., theLucianists, who taught all this, and further, that the animal Soul was not immortal, were philosophizing on the grounds ofthe real Kabalistic and Occult teachings.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 240 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.As is well known, the Kabala never originated with the Jews, who got their ideas from the Chaldeans and the Egyptians.Thus even the now exoteric Kabalistic teachings speak of a Central Sun, and of three secondary suns in each solarsystem -- our own included. As shown in that able though too materialistic work, \"New Aspects of Life and Religion,\"which is a synopsis of the views of the Kabalists in an aspect deeply thought out and assimilated:--\"The Central Sun . . . was to them (as much as to the Aryans) the centre of Rest; the centre to which all motion was to beultimately referred. Round this central sun . . . 'the first of three systemic suns . . . revolved on a polar plane . . . thesecond, on an equatorial plane' . . . and the third only was our visible sun. These four solar bodies were 'the organs onwhose action what man calls the creation, the evolution of life on the planet, earth, depends.' The channels through whichthe influence of these bodies was conveyed to the earth they (the Kabalists) held to be electrical\" (p. 287). . . . \"Theradiant energy flowing from the central sun* called the Earth into being as a watery globe,\" whose tendency, \"as thenucleus of a planetary body, was to rush to the (central) Sun . . . . within the sphere of whose attraction it had beencreated,\" \"but the radiant energy, similarly electrifying both, withheld the one from the other, and so changed motiontowards into motion round the centre of attraction, which the revolving planet (earth) thus sought to reach.\"In the organic cell the visible sun found its own proper matrix, and produced through this the animal (while maturing thevegetable) Kingdom, finally placing man at its head, in whom, through the animating action of that Kingdom, it originatedthe psychic cell. But the man so placed at the head of the animal kingdom, at the head of the creation, was the animal,the soul-less, the perishable man. . . . Hence man, although apparently its crown, would, by his advent have marked theclose of creation; since creation, culminating in him, would at his death have entered on its decline\" . . . (p. 289).This Kabalistic view is here quoted, to show its perfect identity in spirit with the Eastern doctrine. Explain, or complete theteaching of the seven Suns with the seven systems of planes of being, of which the \"Suns\" are the central bodies, andyou have the seven angelic planes,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This \"central sun\" of the Occultists, which even Science is obliged to accept astronomically, for it cannot deny thepresence in Sidereal Space of a central body in the milky way, a point unseen and mysterious, the ever-hidden centre ofattraction of our Sun and system -- this \"Sun\" is viewed differently by the Occultists of the East. While the Western andJewish Kabalists (and even some pious modern astronomers) claim that in this sun the God-head is specially present --referring to it the volitional acts of God -- the Eastern Initiates maintain that, as the supradivine Essence of the UnknownAbsolute is equally in every domain and place, the \"Central Sun\" is simply the centre of Universal life-Electricity; thereservoir within which that divine radiance, already differentiated at the beginning of every creation, is focussed. Thoughstill in a laya, or neutral condition, it is, nevertheless, the one attracting, as also the ever-emitting, life Centre.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 241 \"PRINCIPLES\" EXPLAINED.whose \"Host\" are gods thereof, collectively. (See Comm. to Stanza VII Book I.) They are the Head-group divided into fourclasses from the incorporeal down to the semi-corporeal, which classes are directly connected -- though in very differentways as regards voluntary connection and functions -- with our mankind. They are three, synthesized by the fourth (thefirst and highest), which is called the \"Central Sun\" in the Kabalistic doctrine just quoted. This is the great differencebetween the Semitic and the Aryan Cosmogony; one materializing, humanizes the mysteries of nature; the otherspiritualizes matter, and its physiology is always made subservient to metaphysics. Thus, though the seventh principlereaches man through all the phases of being, pure as an indiscrete element and an impersonal unity, it passes through(the Kabala teaches from) the Central Spiritual Sun and Group the second (the polar Sun), which two radiate on man hisAtma. Group Three (the equatorial Sun) cement the Buddhi to Atman and the higher attributes of Manas, while groupFour (the spirit of our visible sun) endows him with his Manas and its vehicle -- the Kama rupa, or body of passions anddesires, the two elements of Ahamkara which evolve individualized consciousness -- the personal ego. Finally, it is thespirit of the Earth in its triple unity that builds the physical body, attracting to it the Spirits of Life and forming his LingaSarira.Now, as everything proceeds cyclically, the evolution of man like everything else, the order in which he is generated isdescribed fully in the Eastern teachings, whereas it is only hinted at in the Kabala. Says the Book of Dzyan with regard toprimeval man when first projected by the \"Boneless,\" the incorporeal Creator: \"First, the Breath, then Buddhi, and theShadow-Son (the Body) were 'CREATED.' But where was the pivot (the middle principle, Manas)? Man is doomed. Whenalone, the indiscrete (undifferentiated Element) and the Vahan (Buddhi) -- the cause of the causeless -- break asunderfrom manifested life\" -- \"unless cemented and held together by the middle principle, the vehicle of the personalconsciousness of JIVA\"; explains the Commentary. In other words, the two higher principles can have no individuality onEarth, cannot be man, unless there is (a) the Mind, the Manas-Ego, to cognize itself, and (b) the terrestrial falsepersonality, or the body of egotistical desires and personal Will, to cement the whole, as if round a pivot (which it is, truly),to the physical form of man. It is the Fifth and the Fourth principles* -- Manas and Kama rupa -- that contain the dualpersonality: the real immortal Ego (if it assimilates itself to the two higher) and the false and transitory personality, themayavi or astral body, so-called, or the animal-human Soul -- the two hav-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Fourth, and the Fifth from below beginning by the physical body; the Third and the Fourth, if we reckon from Atma."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 242 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.ing to be closely blended for purposes of a full terrestrial existence. Incarnate the Spiritual Monad of a Newton grafted onthat of the greatest saint on earth -- in a physical body the most perfect you can think of -- i.e., in a two or even a three-principled body composed of its Sthula Sarira, prana (life principle), and linga sarira -- and, if it lacks its middle and fifthprinciples, you will have created an idiot -- at best a beautiful, soul-less, empty and unconscious appearance. \"Cogito --ergo sum\" -- can find no room in the brain of such a creature, not on this plane, at any rate.There are students, however, who have long ago understood the philosophical meaning underlying the allegory -- sotortured and disfigured by the Roman Church -- of the Fallen Angels. \"The Kingdom of Spirits and spiritual action whichflows from and is the product of Spirit Volition, is outside and contrasted with and in contradiction to the Kingdom of(divine) Souls and divine action.\"* As said in the text:--\"Like produces like and no more at the genesis of being, and evolution with its limited conditioned laws comes later. TheSelf-Existentt are called CREATIONS, for they appear in the Spirit Ray, manifested through the potency inherent in itsUNBORN Nature, which is beyond time and (limited or conditioned) Space. Terrene products, animate and inanimate,including mankind, are falsely called creation and creatures: they are the development (evolution) of the discreteelements.\" (Com. xiv.) Again:--\"The Heavenly rupa (Dhyan Chohan) creates (man) in his own form; it is a spiritual ideation consequent on the firstdifferentiation and awakening of the universal (manifested) Substance; that form is the ideal shadow of Itself: and this isTHE MAN OF THE FIRST RACE.\"To express it in still clearer form, limiting the explanation to this earth only, it was the duty of the first \"differentiated Egos\"-- the Church calls them Archangels -- to imbue primordial matter with the evolutionary impulse and guide its formativepowers in the fashioning of its productions. This it is which is referred to in the sentences both in the Eastern and Westerntradition --\"the Angels were commanded to create.\" After the Earth had been made ready by the lower and more materialpowers, and its three Kingdoms fairly started on their way to be \"fruitful and multiply,\" the higher powers, the Archangelsor Dhyanis, were compelled by the evolutionary Law to descend on Earth, in order to construct the crown of its evolution -- MAN. Thus the \"Self-created\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"New Aspects of Life.\"** Angelic, Spiritual Essences, immortal in their being because unconditioned in Eternity; periodical and conditioned intheir Manvantaric manifestations.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 243 MAN, THE PALE SHADOW OF GOD.and the \"Self-existent\" projected their pale shadows; but group the Third, the Fire-Angels, rebelled and refused to jointheir Fellow Devas.Hindu exotericism represents them all as Yogins, whose piety inspired them to refuse creating, as they desired to remaineternally Kumaras, \"Virgin Youths,\" in order to, if possible, anticipate their fellows in progress towards Nirvana -- the finalliberation. But, agreeably to esoteric interpretation, it was a self-sacrifice for the benefit of mankind. The \"Rebels\" wouldnot create will-less irresponsible men, as the \"obedient\" angels did; nor could they endow human beings with only thetemporary reflections of their own attributes; for even the latter, belonging to another and a so-much higher plane ofconsciousness, would leave man still irresponsible, hence interfere with any possibility of a higher progress. No spiritualand psychic evolution is possible on earth -- the lowest and most material plane -- for one who on that plane, at allevents, is inherently perfect and cannot accumulate either merit or demerit. Man remaining the pale shadow of the inert,immutable, and motionless perfection, the one negative and passive attribute of the real I am that I am, would have beendoomed to pass through life on earth as in a heavy dreamless sleep; hence a failure on this plane. The Beings, or theBeing, collectively called Elohim, who first (if ever) pronounced the cruel words, \"Behold, the man is become as one of us,to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever . . . \"must have been indeed the Ilda-baoth, the Demiurge of the Nazarenes, filled with rage and envy against his owncreature, whose reflection created Ophiomorphos. In this case it is but natural -- even from the dead letter standpoint -- toview Satan, the Serpent of Genesis, as the real creator and benefactor, the Father of Spiritual mankind. For it is he whowas the \"Harbinger of Light,\" bright radiant Lucifer, who opened the eyes of the automaton created by Jehovah, asalleged; and he who was the first to whisper: \"in the day ye eat thereof ye shall be as Elohim, knowing good and evil\" --can only be regarded in the light of a Saviour. An \"adversary\" to Jehovah the \"personating spirit,\" he still remains inesoteric truth the ever-loving \"Messenger\" (the angel), the Seraphim and Cherubim who both knew well, and loved stillmore, and who conferred on us spiritual, instead of physical immortality -- the latter a kind of static immortality that wouldhave transformed man into an undying \"Wandering Jew.\"As narrated in King's \"Gnostics,\" \"Ilda-Baoth, whom several sects regarded as the God of Moses, was not a pure spirit,he was ambitious and proud, and rejecting the spiritual light of the middle space offered him by his mother Sophia-Achamoth, he set himself to create a world of his own.

It was a monster, soulless, ignorant, and crawling on all fours on the ground like a materialbeast. Ilda-Baoth was forced to implore the help of his spiritual mother. She communicated to him a ray of her divine light,and so animated man and endowed him with a soul. And now began the animosity of Ilda-Baoth toward his own creature."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Following the impulse of the divine light, man soared higher and higher in his aspirations; very soon he began presentingnot the image of his creator Ilda-Baoth but rather that of the Supreme Being, the 'primitive man,' Ennoia. Then theDemiurgos was filled with rage and envy; and fixing his jealous eye on the abyss of matter, his looks envenomed withpassion were suddenly reflected as in a mirror; the reflection became animate, and there arose out of the abyss Satan,serpent, Ophiomorphos -- 'the embodiment of envy and cunning. He is the union of all that is most base in matter, withthe hate, envy, and craft of a spiritual intelligence.' \" This is the exoteric rendering of the Gnostics, and the allegory,though a sectarian version, is suggestive, and seems true to life. It is the natural deduction from the dead letter text ofchapter iii. of Genesis.Hence the allegory of Prometheus, who steals the divine fire so as to allow men to proceed consciously on the path ofspiritual evolution, thus transforming the most perfect of animals on earth into a potential god, and making him free to\"take the kingdom of heaven by violence.\" Hence also, the curse pronounced by Zeus against Prometheus, and byJehovah-Il-da-Baoth against his \"rebellious son,\" Satan.

At the same time he is pain, which is the Re-action of the pleasure of action, and death -- which is therevolution of life -- Satan, burning in his own hell, produced by the fury of his own momentum -- the expansivedisintegration of the nebulae which is to concentrate into new worlds. And fitly is he again and again baffled by the eternalInertia of the passive energy of the Kosmos -- the inexorable 'I AM' -- the flint from which the sparks are beaten out. Fitlyis he . . . and his adherents . . . consigned to the 'sea of fire,' because it is the Sun (in one sense only in the Cosmicallegory), the fount of life in our system, where they are purified (disintegrated) and churned up to re-arrange them foranother life (the resurrection); that Sun which, as the origin of the active principle of our Earth, is at once the Home andthe Source of the Mundane Satan. . . .\" To demonstrate furthermore the accuracy of Baissac's general theory (in LeDiable et Satan) cold is known to have a 'Centripetal' effect. \"Under the influence of cold everything contracts. . . .

But for all that there is a kindof Immortal Existence in the Nifl-heim, and that existence must be painless and peaceful, because it is Unconscious andInactive.

If \"man's uses of life should be such asneither to animalize nor to spiritualize, but to humanize Self,\"* before he can do so, he must be born human not angelic.Hence, tradition shows the celestial Yogis offering themselves as voluntary victims in order to redeem Humanity --created god-like and perfect at first -- and to endow him with human affections and aspirations. To do this they had togive up their natural status and, descending on our globe, take up their abode on it for the whole cycle of the Mahayuga,thus exchanging their impersonal individualities for individual personalities -- the bliss of sidereal existence for the curseof terrestrial life. This voluntary sacrifice of the Fiery Angels, whose nature was Knowledge and Love, was construed bythe exoteric theologies into a statement that shows \"the rebel angels hurled down from heaven into the darkness of Hell\" -- our Earth.

In the picture from this Nahash, this spirit was representedby a serpent, because from its destitution of bodily members, the Serpent was looked upon as a deprived and depravedand degraded creature\" (\"New Aspects,\" p. 235).

(Zohar iii., 61, C.)And let me explain at once that our quarrel is not with the Zohar and the Kabala in their right interpretation -- for the latteris ours -- but only with the gross, pseudo-esoteric explanations of the later, and especially those of the ChristianKabalists.\"Our earth and man,\" says the Commentary, \"being the products of the three Fires\" -- whose three names answer, inSanskrit, to \"the electric fire, the Solar fire, and the fire produced by friction,\" -- these three fires, explained on the Cosmicand human planes, are Spirit, Soul, and Body, the three great Root groups, with their four additional divisions. These varywith the Schools, and become -- according to their applications -- the upadhis and the vehicles, or the noumena of these.In the exoteric accounts, they are personified by the \"three sons of surpassing brilliancy and splendour\" of AgniAbhimanin, the eldest son of Brahma, the Cosmic LOGOS, by Swaha, one of Daksha's* daughters. In the metaphysicalsense the \"Fire of friction\" means the Union between Buddhi, the sixth, and Manas, the fifth, principles, which thus areunited or cemented together; the fifth merging partially into and becoming part of the monad; in the physical, it relates tothe creative spark, or germ, which fructifies and generates the human being. The three Fires, it is said (whose names arePavaka, Pavamana and Suchi) were condemned by a curse of Vasishta, the great sage, \"to be born over and overagain.\" (Bhagavata-Purana iv. 24, 4.)

He is the chief of the Prajapati -- the Lords or Creators of Being. In Vishnu Purana, Parasara says of him, \"in everyKalpa (or manvantara) Daksha and the rest are born and are again destroyed.\" And the Rig-Veda says that \"Dakshasprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha,\" a reference to the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine Essence.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 248 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Rishis, Kumaras,* etc. etc., are said to incarnate personally in the Third Root-Race and thus find themselves \"reborn overand over again.\" In the Esoteric doctrine they are generally named the Asuras, or the Asu-ra Devata or Pitar-devata(gods) for, as said, they were first Gods -- and the highest -- before they became \"no-gods,\" and had from Spirits ofHeaven fallen into Spirits of the Earth** -- exoterically, note well, in orthodox dogma.No Theologian, any more than an Orientalist, can ever understand the genealogies of the Prajapati, the Manus, and theRishis, nor the direct connection of these -- or their correlation rather -- with the Gods, unless he has the key to the oldprimitive Cosmogony and Theogony, which all the Nations originally had in common.

The \"old Book\" goes into various details of Astral life,which at this juncture would be quite incomprehensible to the reader. It may, therefore, be left for later explanations, andthe First and Second Races can now only receive bare notice. Not so for the Third Race -- the Root-Race whichseparated into sexes, and which was the first to be endowed with reason.

Strictly speaking, esoteric philosophy teaches amodified polygenesis. For, while it assigns to humanity a oneness of origin, in so far that its forefathers or \"Creators\" wereall divine beings -- though of different classes or degrees of perfection in their hierarchy -- men were nevertheless born onseven different centres of the continent of that period. Though all of one common origin, yet for reasons given theirpotentialities and mental capabilities, outward or physical forms, and future characteristics, were very different.* As totheir complexions, there is a suggestive allegory told in Linga Purana. The Kumdra -- the Rudra gods, so called (seefurther), are described as incarnations of Siva, the destroyer (of outward forms), named also Vamadeva. The latter, as aKumara, the \"Eternal Celibate,\" the chaste Virgin youth, springs from Brahma in each great Manvantara, and \"againbecomes four\"; a reference to the four great divisions of the human races, as regards complexion and type -- and threechief variations of these. Thus in the 29th Kalpa -- in this case a reference to the transformation and evolution of thehuman form which Siva ever destroys and remodels periodically, down to the manvantaric great turning point about themiddle of the Fourth (Atlantean) Race -- in the 29th Kalpa, Siva, as Swetalohita, the root Kumara, becomes, from moon-coloured, white; in his next transformation -- he is red (and in this the exoteric version differs from the Esoteric teaching);in the third -- yellow; in the fourth -- black.Esotericism now classes these seven variations, with their four great divisions, into only three distinct primeval races -- asit does not take into consideration the First Race, which had neither type nor colour, and hardly an objective, thoughcolossal form. The evolution of these races, their formation and development, went pari passu and on parallel lines withthe evolution, formation, and development of three geological strata, from which the human complexion was as muchderived as it was determined by the climates of those zones. It names three great divisions, namely, the RED-YELLOW,the BLACK, and the BROWN-WHITE.** The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock -- the Fifth Root-Race -- andspring[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Some superior, others inferior, to suit the Karma of the various reincarnating Monads which could not be all of the samedegree of purity in their last births in other worlds.

(Vide at the end of this Stanza, \"THE PRIMEVAL MANUSOF HUMANITY.\") The light yellow is the colour of the first SOLID human race, which appeared after the middle of theThird Root Race (after its fall into generation -- as just explained), bringing on the final changes. For, it is only at thatperiod that the last transformation took place, which brought forth man as he is now, only on a magnified scale. This Racegave birth to the Fourth Race; \"Siva\" gradually transforming that portion of Humanity which became \"black with sin\" intored-yellow (the red Indians and the Mongolians being the descendants of these) and finally into Brown-white races --which now, together with the yellow Races, form the great bulk of Humanity.

And if man, in his gradual consolidation,developed pari passu with the earth, how many millions of years must have elapsed during the First, Second, and the firsthalf of the Third Race? For the Earth was in a comparatively ethereal condition before it reached its last consolidatedstate; the archaic teachings, moreover, telling us that, during the middle period of the Lemuro-Atlantean Race, three anda half Races after the Genesis of man, the Earth, man, and everything on the Globe was of a still grosser and morematerial nature, while such things as corals and some shells were still in a semi-gelatinous, astral state. The cycles thatintervened since then, have already carried us onward, on the opposite ascending arc, some steps toward ourdematerialization, as the spiritualists would say. The Earth, ourselves, and all things have softened since then -- aye,even our brains. But it has been objected by some theosophists that an ethereal Earth even some 15, or 20,000,000years ago, does not square with Geology, which teaches us that winds blew, rains fell, waves broke on the shore, sandsshifted and accumulated,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It must be remembered that the \"last remnants\" here spoken of, refer to those portions of the \"great continent\" which stillremained, and not to any of the numerous islands which existed contemporaneously with the continent. Plato's \"island\"was, for instance, one of such remnants; the others having sunk at various periods previously. An occult \"tradition\"teaches that such submersions occur whenever there is an eclipse of the \"spiritual sun.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 251 ANSWERS TO OBJECTIONS.etc., etc., that, in short, all natural causes now in operation were then in force, \"in the very earliest ages of geologicaltime, aye, that of the oldest palaeozoic rocks.\" To this the following answers are given. Firstly, what is the date assignedby geology to those \"oldest palaezoic rocks\"? And secondly, why could not the winds blow, rain fall, and waves (ofcarbonic acid apparently, as science seems to imply) break on the shore, on an Earth semi-astral, i.e., viscid? The word\"astral\" does not necessarily mean as thin as smoke, in occult phraseology, but rather \"starry,\" shining or pellucid, invarious and numerous degrees, from a quite filmy to a viscid state, as just observed. But it is further objected: How couldan astral Earth have affected the other planets in this system? Would not the whole process get out of gear now if theattraction of one planet was suddenly removed? The objection is evidently invalid, since our system is composed of olderand younger planets, some dead (like the moon), others in process of formation, for all astronomy knows to the contrary.Nor has the latter ever affirmed, so far as we know, that all the bodies of our system have sprung into existence anddeveloped simultaneously. The Cis-Himalayan secret teachings differ from those of India in this respect. Hindu Occultismteaches that the Vaivasvata Manu Humanity is eighteen million and odd years old. We say, yes; but only so far asphysical, or approximately physical, man is concerned, who dates from the close of the Third Root-Race. Beyond thatperiod MAN, or his filmy image, may have existed for 300 million years, for all we know; since we are not taught figureswhich are and will remain secret with the Masters of Occult Science, as justly stated in \"Esoteric Buddhism.\" Moreover,whereas the Hindu Puranas speak of one Vaivasvata Manu, we affirm that there were several, the name being a genericone. (Vide supra).We must now say a few more words on the physical evolution of man.-------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 251 ANSWERS TO OBJECTIONS.ARCHAIC TEACHINGS IN THE PURANAS AND GENESIS.PHYSICAL EVOLUTION.The writer cannot give too much proof that the system of Cosmogony and Anthropogony as described actually existed,that its records are preserved, and that it is found mirrored even in the modern versions of ancient Scriptures.The Puranas on the one hand, and the Jewish Scriptures on the other, are based on the same scheme of evolution,which, read esoterically and expressed in modern language, would be found to be quite as scientific as much of what nowpasses current as the final word of recent discovery. The only difference between the two schemes is, that------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 252 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Puranas, giving as much, and perhaps more attention to the causes than to the effects, allude to the pre-Cosmic andpre-Genetic periods rather than to those of so-called Creation, whereas the Bible, saying only a few words of the formerperiod, plunges forthwith into material genesis, and, while nearly skipping the pre-Adamic races, proceeds with itsallegories concerning the Fifth Race.Now, whatever the onslaught made on the Order of creation in Genesis, and its dead letter account certainly lends itselfadmirably to criticism,* he who reads the Hindu Puranas -- its allegorical exaggerations notwithstanding -- will find themquite in accordance with physical Science.Even what appears to be the, on the face of it, perfectly nonsensical allegory of Brahma assuming the form of a Boar torescue the Earth from under the waters, finds in the Secret Commentaries a perfectly scientific explanation, relating as itdoes to the many risings and sinkings, and the constant alternation of water and land from the earliest to the latestgeological periods of our globe; for Science teaches us now that nine-tenths of the stratified formations of the earth'scrust have been gradually constructed beneath water, at the bottom of the seas. The ancient Aryans are credited withhaving known nothing whatever of natural history, geology, and so on. The Jewish race is, on the other hand, proclaimedeven by its severest critic, an uncompromising opponent of the Bible, (See \"Modern Science and Modern Thought,\" p.337), to have the merit of having conceived the idea of monotheism \"earlier, and retained it more firmly, than any of the"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"less philosophical and more immoral religions (! !) of the ancient world.\" Only, while we find in Biblical esotericismphysiological sexual mysteries symbolised, and very little[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Mr. Gladstone's unfortunate attempt to reconcile the Genetic account with science (see Nineteenth Century, \"Dawn ofCreation\" and the \"Proem to Genesis,\" 1886) has brought upon him the Jovian thunderbolt hurled by Mr. Huxley.

Mr. Gladstone killedGenesis for ever. But this does not prove that there is no esotericism in the latter. The fact that the Jews and all theChristians, the modern as well as the early sects, have accepted the narrative literally for two thousand years, shows onlytheir ignorance; and shows the great ingenuity and constructive ability of the initiated Rabbis, who have built the twoaccounts -- the Elohistic and the Jehovistic -- esoterically, and have purposely confused the meaning by the vowellessglyphs or word-signs in the original text. The six days -- yom -- of creation do mean six periods of evolution, and theseventh that of culmination of perfection (not of rest), and refer to the seven Rounds and the seven Races with a distinct\"creation\" in each; though the use of the words boker, dawn or morning, and crib, evening twilight -- which haveesoterically the same meaning as sandhya, twilight, in Sanskrit -- have led to a charge of the most crass ignorance of theorder of evolution.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 253 MR.

What are all the myths and endless genealogies of the sevenPrajapati, and their sons, the seven Rishis or Manus, and of their wives, sons and progeny, but a vast detailed account ofthe progressive development and evolution of animal creation, one species after the other? Were the highly philosophicaland metaphysical Aryans -- the authors of the most perfect philosophical systems of transcendental psychology, of Codesof Ethics, and such a grammar as Panini's, of the Sankhya and Vedanta systems, and a moral code (Buddhism),proclaimed by Max Muller the most perfect on earth -- such fools, or children, as to lose their time in writing fairy-tales;such tales as the Puranas now seem to be in the eyes of those who have not the remotest idea of their secret meaning?What is the fable, the genealogy and origin of Kasyapa, with his twelve wives, by whom he had a numerous anddiversified progeny of nagas (serpents), reptiles, birds, and all kinds of living things, and who was thus the father of allkinds of animals, but a veiled record of the order of evolution in this round? So far, we do not see that any Orientalist everhad the remotest conception of the truths concealed under the allegories and personifications. \"The SatapathaBrahmana,\" says one, \"gives a not very intelligible account of Kasyapa's origin. . . . He was the son of Marichi, the Son ofBrahma, the father of Vivasvat, the father of Manu, the progenitor of mankind. . . . Having assumed the form of a tortoise,Prajapati created offspring. That which he created he made akarot, hence the word kurma (tortoise). Kasyapa meanstortoise; hence men say: 'All creatures are descendants of Kasyapa,' etc., etc. (Hindu Class. Dict.)He was all this; he was also the father of Garuda, the bird, the \"King------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 254 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of the feathered tribe,\" who descends from, and is of one stock with the reptiles, the nagas; and who becomes theirmortal enemy subsequently as he is also a cycle, a period of time, when in the course of evolution the birds whichdeveloped from reptiles in their \"struggle for life,\" -- \"survival of the fittest,\" etc., etc., turned in preference on those theyissued from, to devour them, -- perhaps prompted by natural law, in order to make room for other and more perfectspecies. (Vide Part II., \"Symbolism.\")In that admirable epitome of \"Modern Science and Modern Thought,\" a lesson in natural history is offered to Mr.Gladstone, showing the utter variance with it of the Bible. The author remarks that Geology, commencing with --\" . . . the earliest known fossil, the Eozoon Canadense of the Laurentian, continued in a chain, every link of which is firmlywelded, through the Silurian, with its abundance of molluscous, crustacean, and vermiform life and first indication offishes; the Devonian, with its predominance of fish and first appearance of reptiles; the Mesozoic with its batrachians (orfrog family); the Secondary formations, in which reptiles of the sea, land and air preponderated, and the first humbleforms of vertebrate land animals began to appear; and finally, the Tertiary, in which mammalian life has becomeabundant, and type succeeding to type and species to species, are gradually differentiated and specialized, through theEocene, Miocene, and Pliocene periods, until we arrive at the Glacial and Pre-historic periods, and at positive proof of theexistence of man.\"The same order, plus the description of animals unknown to modern science, is found in the commentaries on thePuranas in general, and in the Book of Dzyan -- especially. The only difference, a grave one, no doubt, -- as implying aspiritual and divine nature of man independent of his physical body in this illusionary world, in which the false personalityand its cerebral basis alone is known to orthodox psychology -- is as follows.

Once united, the two and then the three made one;for though the lower animals, from the amoeba to man, received their monads, in which all the higher qualities arepotential, all have to remain dormant till each reaches its human form, before which stage manas (mind) has nodevelopment in them.* In the animals every principle is paralysed, and in a foetus-like state, save the second (vital) andthe third (the astral), and the rudiments of the fourth (Kama, which is desire, instinct) whose intensity and developmentvaries and changes with the species. To the materialist wedded to the Darwinian theory, this will read like a fairy-tale, amystification; to the believer in the inner, spiritual man, the statement will have nothing unnatural in it.Now the writer is certain to meet what will be termed insuperable objections. We shall be told that the line of embryology,the gradual development of every individual life, and the progress of what is known to take place in the order ofprogressive stages of specialization -- that all this is opposed to the idea of man preceding mammals. Man begins as thehumblest and most primitive vermiform creature, \"from the primitive speck of protoplasm and the nucleated cell in whichall life originates,\" and \"is developed through stages undistinguishable from those of fish, reptile and mammal, until thecell finally attains the highly specialized development of the quadrumanous, and last of all, of the human type.\" (Laing,335.)This is perfectly scientific, and we have nothing against that; for all this relates to the shell of man -- his body, which in itsgrowth is subject, of course, like every other (once called) morphological unit, to such metamorphoses. It is not those whoteach the transformation of the mineral atom through crystallization -- which is the same function, and bears the samerelation to its inorganic (so-called) upadhi (or basis) as the formation of cells to their organic nuclei, through plant, insectand animal into man -- it is not they who will reject this theory, as it will finally lead to the recognition of a Universal Deityin nature, ever-present and as ever invisible, and unknowable, and of intra-Cosmic gods, who all were men.**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Men are made complete only during their third, toward the fourth cycle (race). They are made 'gods' for good and evil,and responsible only when the two arcs meet (after 31/2 rounds towards the fifth Race).

(Commentary IX.)** The whole trouble is this: neither physiologists nor pathologists will recognize that the cell-germinating substance (thecytoblastema) and the mother-lye from which crystals originate, are one and the same essence, save in differentiation forpurposes.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 256 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.But we would ask, what does science and its exact and now axiomatic discoveries prove against our Occult theory?Those who believe in the law of Evolution and gradual progressive development from a cell (which from a vital hasbecome a morphological cell, until it awoke as protoplasm pure and simple) -- these can surely never limit their belief toone line of evolution. The types of life are innumerable; and the progress of evolution, moreover, does not go at the samerate in every kind of species. The constitution of primordial matter in the Silurian age -- we mean \"primordial\" matter ofscience -- is the same in every essential particular, save its degree of present grossness, as the primordial living matter ofto-day. Nor do we find that which ought to be found, if the now orthodox theory of Evolution were quite correct, namely, aconstant, ever-flowing progress in every species of being. Instead of that, what does one see? While the intermediategroups of animal being all tend toward a higher type, and while specializations, now of one type and now of another,develop through the geological ages, change forms, assume new shapes, appear and disappear with a kaleidoscopicrapidity in the description of paleontologists from one period to another, the two solitary exceptions to the general rule arethose at the two opposite poles of life and type, namely -- MAN and the lower genera of being!\"Certain well-marked forms of living beings have existed through enormous epochs, surviving not only the changes ofphysical conditions, but persisting comparatively unaltered, while other forms of life have appeared and disappeared.Such forms may be termed 'persistent types' of life; and examples of them are abundant enough in both the animal andthe vegetable worlds\" (Huxley, \"Proceed. of Roy. Inst.,\" vol. iii., p. 151).Nevertheless, we are not given any good reason why Darwin links together reptiles, birds, amphibians, fishes, mollusca,etc., etc., as off-shoots of a moneric ancestry. Nor are we told whether reptiles, for instance, are direct descendants of theamphibian, the latter of fishes, and fishes of lower forms -- which they certainly are. For the Monads have passed throughall these forms of being up to man, on every planet, in the Three preceding Rounds; every Round, as well as everysubsequent Globe, from A to G, having been, and still having to be the arena of the same evolution, only repeated eachtime on a more solid material basis. Therefore the question:-- \"What relation is there between the Third Round astral"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"prototypes and ordinary physical development in the course of the origination of pre-mammalian organic species?\" -- iseasily answered.

The fish evolved into an amphibian -- a frog -- in the shadows of ponds, and manpassed through all his metamorphoses on this Globe in the Third Round as he did in this, his Fourth Cycle. The ThirdRound types contributed to the formation of the types in this one. On strict analogy, the cycle of Seven Rounds in theirwork of the gradual formation of man through every kingdom of Nature, are repeated on a microscopical scale in the firstseven months of gestation of a future human being. Let the student think over and work out this analogy. As the sevenmonths' old unborn baby, though quite ready, yet needs two months more in which to acquire strength and consolidate;so man, having perfected his evolution during seven Rounds, remains two periods more in the womb of mother-Naturebefore he is born, or rather reborn a Dhyani, still more perfect than he was before he launched forth as a Monad on thenewly built chain of worlds. Let the student ponder over this mystery, and then he will easily convince himself that, asthere are also physical links between many classes, so there are precise domains wherein the astral merges into physicalevolution. Of this Science breathes not one word. Man has evolved with and from the monkey, it says. But now see thecontradiction.Huxley proceeds to point out plants, ferns, club mosses, some of them generically identical with those now living, whichare met with in the carboniferous epoch, for:-- \"The cone of the oolitic Araucaria is hardly distinguishable from that ofexisting species. . . . . Subkingdoms of animals yield the same instances. The globigerina of the Atlantic soundings isidentical with the cretaceous species of the same genus . . . the tabulate corals of the Silurian epoch are wonderfully likethe millepores of our own seas. . . . The arachnida, the highest group of which, the scorpions, is represented in the coalby a genus differing only from its living congeners only in . . . the eyes,\" etc., etc.; all of which may be closed with Dr.Carpenter's authoritative statement about the Foraminifera. \"There is no evidence,\" he says, \"of any fundamentalmodification or advance in the Foraminiferous type from the palaeozoic period to the present time. . . . The ForminiferousFauna of our own series probably present a greater range of variety than existed at any previous period; but there is noindication of any tendency to elevation towards a higher type.\" (\"Introduction to the study of the Forminifera,\" p. xi.)Now, if there is no indication of change in the Forminifera, a protozoon of the lowest type of life, mouthless and eyeless,except its greater variety now than before, man, who is on the uppermost rung of the ladder of being, indicates still lesschange, as we have seen; the skeleton of his Palaeolithic ancestor being even found------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 258 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.superior in some respects to his present frame. Where is, then, the claimed uniformity of law, the absolute rule for onespecies shading off into another, and, by insensible gradations, into higher types? We see Sir William Thomson admittingas much as 400,000,000 of years in the earth's history, since the surface of the globe became sufficiently cool to permit ofthe presence of living things;\" and during that enormous lapse of time in the Oolitic period alone, the so-called \"age ofreptiles,\" we find a most extraordinary variety and abundance of Saurian forms, the Amphibian type reaching its highestdevelopments. We learn of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri in the lakes and rivers, and of winged crocodiles or lizards flyingin the air. After which, in the Tertiary period \"we find the Mammalian type exhibiting remarkable divergences frompreviously existing forms . . . . Mastodons, Megatheriums, and other unwieldy denizens of the ancient forests and plains;and subsequently,\" are notified of -- \"the gradual modification of one of the ramifications of the Quadrumanous order, intothose beings from whom primeval man himself may claim to have been evolved.\" (\"The Beginnings of Life.\")He may; but no one, except materialists, can see why he should; as there is not the slightest necessity for it, nor is suchan evolution warranted by facts, for those most interested in the proofs thereof confess their utter failure to find one singlefact to support their theory. There is no need for the numberless types of life to represent the members of one progressiveseries. They are \"the products of various and different evolutional divergences, taking place now in one direction and nowin another.\" Therefore it is far more justifiable to say that the monkey evolved into the Quadrumanous order, than thatprimeval man, who has remained stationary in his human specialization ever since his fossil is found in the oldest strata,and of whom no variety is found save in colour and facial type -- has developed from a common ancestor together withthe ape.That man originates like other animals in a cell and develops \"through stages undistinguishable from those of fish, reptile,and mammal until the cell attains the highly specialized development of the quadrumanous and at last the human type,\" isan Occult axiom thousands of years old. The Kabalistic axiom: \"A stone becomes a plant; a plant a beast; a beast a man;a man a God,\" holds good throughout the ages. Haeckel, in his Shopfungsgeschichte, shows a double drawingrepresenting two embryos -- that of a dog six weeks old, and that of a man, eight weeks. The two, except the slightdifference in the head, larger and wider about the brain in the man, are[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Trans. of Geolog.

If we take him up at the more advanced stage where the embryo hasalready passed the reptilian form . . . for a considerable time, the line of development remains the same as that of othermammalia. The rudimentary limbs are exactly similar, the five fingers and toes develop in the same way, and theresemblance after the first four weeks' growth between the embryo of a man and a dog is such that it is scarcely possible"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"to distinguish them. Even at the age of eight weeks the embryo man is an animal with a tail hardly to be distinguishedfrom an embryo puppy\" (\"Modern Science,\" etc., p. 171).Why, then, not make man and dog evolve from a common ancestor, or from a reptile -- a Naga, instead of coupling manwith the quadrumana? This would be just as logical as the other, and more so. The shape and the stages of the humanembryo have not changed since historical times, and these metamorphoses were known to AEsculapius and Hippocratesas well as to Mr. Huxley. Therefore, since the Kabalists had remarked it since prehistoric times, it is no new discovery. In\"Isis,\" Vol. I., 389, it is noticed and half explained.As the embryo of man has no more of the ape in it than of any other mammal, but contains in itself the totality of thekingdoms of nature, and since it seems to be \"a persistent type\" of life, far more so than even the Foraminifera, it seemsas illogical to make him evolve from the ape as it would be to trace his origin to the frog or the dog. Both Occult andEastern philosophies believe in evolution, which Manu and Kapila* give with far more clearness than any scientist does atpresent. No need to repeat that which was fully debated in Isis Unveiled, as the reader may find all these arguments andthe description of the basis on which all the Eastern doctrines of Evolution rested, in our earlier books.** But no Occultistcan accept the unreasonable proposition that all the now existing forms, \"from the structureless Amoeba to man,\" are thedirect lineal descendants of organisms which lived millions and millions of years before the birth of man, in the pre-Silurian epochs, in the sea or land-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Hence the philosophy in the allegory of the 7, 10, and finally 21 Prajapati, Rishis, Munis, etc., who all are made thefathers of various things and beings. The order of the seven classes or orders of plants, animals, and even inanimatethings, given at random in the Puranas, is found in several commentaries in the correct rotation. Thus, Prithu is the fatherof the Earth. He milks her, and makes her bear every kind of grain and vegetable, all enumerated and specified. Kasyapais the father of all the reptiles, snakes, demons, etc., etc.** See Vol. I. 152, et seq., about the tree of evolution -- The \"Mundane Tree.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 260 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.mud. The Occultists believe in an inherent law of progressive development.* Mr. Darwin never did, and says so himself.On page 145 of the \"Origin of Species\" we find him stating that, since there can be no advantage \"to the infusoriananimalcule or an intestinal worm . . . to become highly organized,\" therefore, \"natural selection,\" not including necessarilyprogressive development -- leaves the animalcule and the worm (the \"persistent types\") quiet. There does not appear much uniform law in such behaviour of Nature; and it looks more like the discriminative action ofsome Super-Natural selection; perhaps, that aspect of Karma, which Eastern Occultists would call the \"Law ofRetardation,\" may have something to do with it.But there is every reason to doubt whether Mr. Darwin himself ever gave such an importance to his law -- as is given to itnow by his atheistic followers. The knowledge of the various living forms in the geological periods that have gone by isvery meagre. The reasons given for this by Dr. Bastian are very suggestive: (1) On account of the imperfect manner inwhich the several forms may be represented in the strata pertaining to the period; (2) on account of the extremely limitednature of the explorations which have been made in these imperfectly representative strata; and (3) because so manyparts of the record are absolutely inaccessible to us -- nearly all beneath the Silurian system having been blotted out bytime, whilst those two-thirds of the earth's surface in which the remaining strata are to be found are now covered over byseas. Hence Mr. Darwin says himself:--\"For my part, following out Lyell's metaphor, I look at the geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept, andwritten in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Ofthis volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved, and of each page only here and there a few lines.\"It is not on such meagre data, certainly, that the last word of Science can be said. Nor is it on any ground of human prideor unreasonable belief in man's representing even here on earth -- (in our period, perhaps) -- the highest type of life, thatOccultism denies that all the preceding forms of human life belonged to types lower than our own, for it is not so. Butsimply because the \"missing link,\" such as to prove the existing theory undeniably, will never be found bypalaeontologists. Believing as we do that man has evolved from, and passed through, (during the preceding Rounds) thelowest forms of every life, vegetable and animal, on earth, there is nothing very degrading in the idea of having theorangoutang as an ancestor of our physical form. Quite the reverse; as it[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Checked and modified, however, by the Law of Retardation, which imposes a restriction on the advance of all specieswhen a Higher Type makes its appearance.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 261 NATURE IS UNIFORM.would forward the Occult doctrine with regard to the final evolution of everything in terrestrial nature into man, mostirresistibly. One may even enquire how it is that biologists and anthropologists, having once firmly accepted the theory ofthe descent of man from the ape -- how it is that they have hitherto left untouched the future evolution of the existing apesinto man? This is only a logical sequence of the first theory, unless Science would make of man a privileged being, andhis evolution a non-precedent in nature, quite a special and unique case. And that is what all this leads physical Scienceto. The reason, however, why the Occultists reject the Darwinian, and especially the Haeckelian, hypothesis is because itis the ape which is, in sober truth, a special and unique instance, not man. The pithecoid is an accidental creation, aforced growth, the result of an unnatural process."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The occult doctrine, is, we think, more logical. It teaches a cyclic, never varying law in nature, the latter having nopersonal, \"special design,\" but acting on a uniform plan that prevails through the whole manvantaric period and deals withthe land worm as it deals with man. Neither the one nor the other have sought to come into being, hence both are underthe same evolutionary law, and both have to progress according to Karmic law. Both have started from the same neutralcentre of Life and both have to re-merge into it at the consummation of the cycle.It is not denied that in the preceding Round man was a gigantic apelike creature; and when we say \"man\" we oughtperhaps to say, the rough mould that was developing for the use of man in this Round only -- the middle, or the transitionpoint of which we have hardly reached. Nor was man what he is now during the first two and a half Root-races. That pointhe reached, as said before, only 18,000,000 years ago, during the secondary period, as we claim.Till then he was, according to tradition and Occult teaching, \"a god on earth who had fallen into matter,\" or generation.This may or may not be accepted, since the Secret Doctrine does not impose itself as an infallible dogma; and since,whether its prehistoric records are accepted or rejected, it has nothing to do with the question of the actual man and hisinner nature, the Fall mentioned above having left no original sin on Humanity. But all this has been sufficiently dealt with.Furthermore, we are taught that the transformations through which man passed on the descending arc -- which iscentrifugal for spirit and centripetal for matter -- and those he prepares to go through, henceforward, on his ascendingpath, which will reverse the direction of the two forces -- viz., matter will become centrifugal and spirit centripetal -- that allsuch transformations are next in store for the anthropoid ape also, all those, at any rate, who have reached the removenext to man in this------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 262 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Round -- and these will all be men in the Fifth Round, as present men inhabited ape-like forms in the Third, the precedingRound.Behold, then, in the modern denizens of the great forests of Sumatra the degraded and dwarfed examples -- \"blurredcopies,\" as Mr. Huxley has it -- of ourselves, as we (the majority of mankind) were in the earliest sub-races of the FourthRoot-race during the period of what is called the \"Fall into generation.\" The ape we know is not the product of naturalevolution but an accident, a cross-breed between an animal being, or form, and man. As has been shown in the presentvolume (anthropogenesis), it is the speechless animal that first started sexual connection, having been the first toseparate into males and females. Nor was it intended by Nature that man should follow the bestial example -- as shownby the comparatively painless procreation of their species by the animals, and the terrible suffering and danger of thesame in the woman. The Ape is, indeed, as remarked in Isis Unveiled (Vol. II 278) \"a transformation of species mostdirectly connected with that of the human family -- a hybrid branch engrafted on their own stock before the final perfectionof the latter\" -- or man. The apes are millions of years later than the speaking human being, and are the latestcontemporaries of our Fifth Race. Thus, it is most important to remember that the Egos of the apes are entities compelledby their Karma to incarnate in the animal forms, which resulted from the bestiality of the latest Third and the earliestFourth Race men. They are entities who had already reached the \"human stage\" before this Round. Consequently, theyform an exception to the general rule. The numberless traditions about Satyrs are no fables, but represent an extinct raceof animal men. The animal \"Eves\" were their foremothers, and the human \"Adams\" their forefathers; hence the Kabalisticallegory of Lilith or Lilatu, Adam's first wife, whom the Talmud describes as a charming woman, with long wavy hair, i.e.--a female hairy animal of a character now unknown, still a female animal, who in the Kabalistic and Talmudic allegories iscalled the female reflection of Samael, Samael-Lilith, or man-animal united, a being called Hayo Bischat, the Beast or EvilBeast (Zohar). It is from this unnatural union that the present apes descended. The latter are truly \"speechless men,\" andwill become speaking animals (or men of a lower order) in the Fifth Round, while the adepts of a certain school hope thatsome of the Egos of the apes of a higher intelligence will reappear at the close of the Sixth Root-race. What their form willbe is of secondary consideration. The form means nothing. Species and genera of the flora, fauna, and the highestanimal, its crown -- man, change and vary according to the environments and climatic variations, not only with everyRound, but every Root-Race likewise, as well as after every geological------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 263 MILLIONS OF YEARS HENCE.cataclysm that puts an end to, or produces a turning point in the latter. In the Sixth Root-Race the fossils of the Orang,the Gorilla and the Chimpanzee will be those of extinct quadrumanous mammals; and new forms -- though fewer andever wider apart as ages pass on and the close of the Manvantara approaches -- will develop from the \"cast off\" types ofthe human races as they revert once again to astral, out of the mire of physical, life. There were none before man, andthey will be extinct before the Seventh Race develops. Karma will lead on the monads of the unprogressed men of ourrace and lodge them in the newly evolved human frames of the thus physiologically regenerated baboon. (But see PartIII., Addenda.)This will take place, of course, millions of years hence. But the picture of this cyclic precession of all that lives andbreathes now on earth, of each species in its turn, is a true one, and needs no \"special creation\" or miraculous formationof man, beast, and plant ex nihilo.This is how Occult Science explains the absence of any link between ape and man, and shows the former evolving fromthe latter.-------A PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE EARLY RACES.There is a period of a few millions of years to cover between the first \"mindless\" race and the highly intelligent andintellectual later \"Lemurians\"; there is another between the earliest civilization of the Atlanteans and the historic period."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"As witnesses to the Lemurians but a few silent records in the shape of half a dozen broken colossi and old cyclopeanruins are left. These are not allowed a hearing, as they are \"productions of blind natural forces,\" we are assured by some;\"quite modern\" we are told by others. Tradition is left contemptuously unnoticed by sceptic and materialist, and madesubservient to the Bible in every case by the too zealous Churchman. Whenever a legend, however, refuses to fit in withthe Noachian \"deluge theory,\" it is declared by the Christian clergy \"the insanely delirious voice of old superstition.\"Atlantis is denied, when not confused with Lemuria and other departed continents, because, perhaps, Lemuria is half thecreation of modern science, and has, therefore, to be believed in; while Plato's Atlantis is regarded by most of thescientists as a dream.Atlantis is often described by believers in Plato as a prolongation of Africa. An old continent is also suspected to haveexisted on the Eastern coast. Only Africa, as a continent, was never part and parcel of either Lemuria or Atlantis, as wehave agreed to call the Third and Fourth Continents. Their archaic appellations are never mentioned in the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 264 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Puranas, nor anywhere else. But with simply one of the esoteric keys in hand it becomes an easy task to identify thesedeparted lands in the numberless \"lands of the gods,\" Devas and Munis described in the Puranas, in their Varshas,Dwipas, and zones. Their Sweta-Dwipa, during the early day of Lemuria, stood out like a giant-peak from the bottom ofthe sea; the area between Atlas and Madagascar being occupied by the waters till about the early period of Atlantis (afterthe disappearance of Lemuria), when Africa emerged from the bottom of the ocean, and Atlas was half-sunk.It is of course impossible to attempt, within the compass of even several volumes, a consecutive and detailed account ofthe evolution and progress of the first three races -- except so far as to give a general view of it, as will be done presently.Race the first had no history of its own. Of race the second the same may be said. We shall have, therefore, to paycareful attention only to the Lemurians and the Atlanteans before the history of our own race (the Fifth) can be attempted.What is known of other continents, besides our own, and what does history know or accept of the early races? Everythingoutside the repulsive speculations of materialistic science is daubed with the contemptuous term \"Superstition.\" The wisemen of to-day will believe nothing. Plato's \"winged\" and hermaphrodite races, and his golden age, under the reign ofSaturn and the gods, are quietly brought back by Haeckel to their new place in nature: our divine races are shown to bethe descendants of Catarrhine apes, and our ancestor, a piece of sea slime.Nevertheless, as expressed by Faber, \"the fictions of ancient poetry . . . . will be found to comprehend some portion ofhistorical truth.\" However one-sided the efforts of the learned author of the \"Mysteries of the Kabiri,\" -- efforts directedthroughout his two volumes to constrain the classical myths and symbols of old paganism, \"to bear testimony to the truthof Scripture,\" -- time and further research have avenged, partially at least, that \"truth\" by showing it unveiled. Thus it is theclever adaptations of Scripture, on the contrary, which are made to bear evidence to the great wisdom of archaicpaganism. This, notwithstanding the inextricable confusion into which the truth about the Kabiri -- the most mysteriousgods of antiquity -- was thrown by the wild and contradictory speculations of Bishop Cumberland, Dr. Shuckford,Cudworth, Vallancey, etc., etc., and finally by Faber. Nevertheless, all, from first to last, of these scholars had to come toa certain conclusion framed by the latter. \"We have no reason to think,\" he writes, \"that the idolatry of the Gentile worldwas of a merely arbitrary contrivance; on the contrary, it seems to have been built, almost universally, upon a traditionalremembrance of certain real events. These events I apprehend to be the destruction of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 265 BAILLY AND FABER.the first (the fourth in esoteric teachings) Race of mankind by the waters of the Deluge.\" (Chap. I. p. 9). To this, Faberadds:--\"I am persuaded that the tradition of the sinking of the Phlegian isle is the very same as that of the sinking of the islandAtlantis. They both appear to me to allude to one great event, the sinking of the whole world beneath the waters of thedeluge, or, if we suppose the arch of the earth to have remained in its original position, the rising of the central waterabove it. M. Bailly, indeed, in his work upon the Atlantis of Plato, the object of which is evidently to depreciate theauthority of Scriptural chronology, labours to prove that the Atlanteans were a very ancient northern nation, long prior tothe Hindoos, the Phoenicians, and the Egyptians.\" (\"A Dissertation on the Kabiri,\" p. 284.)In this Faber is in agreement with Bailly, who shows himself more learned and intuitional than those who accept Biblicalchronology. Nor is the latter wrong when saying that the Atlanteans were the same as the Titans and the giants. (See\"Lettres sur l'Atlantide.\") Faber adopts the more willingly the opinion of his French confrere, as Bailly mentions CosmasIndico-Pleustes, who preserved an ancient tradition about Noah -- that he \"formerly inhabited the island Atlantis\" (ibid).This island, whether it was the \"Poseidonis\" mentioned in \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" or the Continent of Atlantis, does notmuch matter. The tradition is there, recorded by a Christian.No Occultist would ever think of dispossessing Noah of his prerogatives, if he is claimed to be an Atlantean; for this wouldsimply show that the Israelites repeated the story of Vaivasvata Manu, Xisuthrus, and so many others, and that they onlychanged the name, to do which they had the same right as any other nation or tribe. What we object to is the literalacceptation of Biblical chronology, as it is absurd, and in accord with neither geological data nor reason. Moreover, ifNoah was an Atlantean, then he was a Titan, a giant, as Faber shows; and if a giant, then why is he not shown as such inGenesis?*Bailly's mistake was to reject the submersion of Atlantis, and to call the Atlanteans simply a Northern and post diluviannation, which, however, as he says, certainly \"flourished before the foundation of the Hindu, the Egyptian, and thePhoenician empires.\" In this, had[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"* This is shown by Faber, again a pious Christian, who says that \"the Noetic family also . . . bore the appellations ofAtlanteans and Titans, and the great patriarch himself was called by way of eminence Atlas and Titan.\" (Vol. II. p. 285).And if so, then, according to the Bible, Noah must have been the progeny of the Sons of God, the fallen angels,agreeably to the same authority, and of the \"daughters of men who were fair,\" (See Genesis, chap. vi.) And why not,since his father Lamech slew a man, and was, with all his sons and daughters (who perished in the Deluge), as bad asthe rest of mankind?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 266 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.he only known of the existence of what we have agreed to call Lemuria, he would have again been right. For theAtlanteans were post diluvian to the Lemurians, and Lemuria was not submerged as Atlantis was, but was sunk under thewaves, owing to earthquakes and subterranean fires, as Great Britain and Europe will be one day. It is the ignorance ofour men of science, who will accept neither the tradition that several continents have already sunk, nor the periodical lawwhich acts throughout the Manvantaric cycle -- it is this ignorance that is the chief cause of all the confusion. Nor is Baillywrong again in assuring us that the Hindus, Egyptians, and Phoenicians came after the Atlanteans, for the latter belongedto the Fourth, while the Aryans and their Semitic Branch are of the Fifth Race. Plato, while repeating the story as narratedto Solon by the priests of Egypt, intentionally confuses (as every Initiate would) the two continents, and assigns to thesmall island which sunk last all the events pertaining to the two enormous continents, the prehistoric and traditional.Therefore, he describes the first couple, from whom the whole island was peopled, as being formed of the Earth. Insaying so, he means neither Adam and Eve, nor yet his own Hellenic forefathers. His language is simply allegorical, andby alluding to \"Earth,\" he means \"matter,\" as the Atlanteans were really the first purely human and terrestrial race -- thosethat preceded it being more divine and ethereal than human and solid.Yet Plato must have known, as would any other initiated adept, about the history of the Third Race after its \"Fall,\" thoughas one pledged to silence and secrecy he never showed his knowledge in so many words. Nevertheless, it may becomeeasier now, after acquainting oneself with even the approximate chronology of the Eastern nations -- all of which wasbased upon, and followed the early Aryan calculations -- to realize the immense periods of time that must have elapsedsince the separation of the sexes, without mentioning the First or even the Second Root-Races. As these must remainbeyond the comprehension of minds trained in Western thought, it is found useless to speak in detail of the First andSecond, and even of the Third Race in its earliest stage.* One has to begin with the latter, when it reached its full humanperiod, lest the uninitiated reader should find himself hopelessly bewildered.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In that wonderful volume of Donnelly's \"Atlantis, the Antediluvian World,\" the author, speaking of the Aryan coloniesfrom Atlantis, and of the arts and sciences the legacy of our Fourth Race -- bravely announces that \"the roots of theinstitutions of to-day reach back to the Miocene age.\" This is an enormous allowance for a modern scholar to make; butcivilization dates still further back than the Miocene Atlanteans. \"Secondary-period\" man will be discovered, and with himhis long forgotten civilization.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 267 THE NATURAL \"FALL.\"The THIRD RACE FELL -- and created no longer: it begot its progeny. Being still mindless at the period of separation itbegot, moreover, anomalous offspring, until its physiological nature had adjusted its instincts in the right direction. Likethe \"lords the gods\" of the Bible ' the \"Sons of Wisdom,\" the Dhyan-Chohans, had warned them to leave alone the fruitforbidden by Nature: but the warning proved of no value. Men realized the unfitness -- we must not say sin -- of what theyhad done, only when too late: after the angelic monads from higher spheres had incarnated in, and endowed them withunderstanding. To that day they had remained simply physical, like the animals generated from them. For what is thedistinction? The doctrine teaches that the only difference between animate and inanimate objects on earth, between ananimal and a human frame, is that in some the various \"fires\" are latent, and in others they are active. The vital fires are inall things and not an atom is devoid of them. But no animal has the three higher principles awakened in him; they aresimply potential, latent, and thus non-existing. And so would the animal frames of men be to this day, had they been leftas they came out from the bodies of their Progenitors, whose shadows they were, to grow, unfolded only by the powersand forces immanent in matter. But as said in PYMANDER:--\"This is a Mystery that to this day was sealed and hidden. Nature* being mingled with Man** brought forth a wondrousmiracle; the harmonious commingling of the essence of the Seven (Pitris, governors) and her own; the Fire and the Spiritand Nature (the noumenon of matter); which (commingling) forthwith brought forth seven men of opposite sexes (negativeand positive) according to the essences of the seven governors.\" (Divine Pymander, Chap. I., Sect. 16.)Thus saith Hermes, the thrice great Initiate,*** \"the Power of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Nature is the natural body, the shadow of the Progenitors; and --** MAN is the \"Heavenly man,\" as already stated.*** The \"Pymander\" of our museums and libraries is an abridgement of one of the Books of Thoth, by a Platonist ofAlexandria. In the Third Century it was remodelled after old Hebrew and Phoenician MSS. by a Jewish Kabalist, andcalled the \"Genesis of Enoch.\" But even its disfigured remnants show how closely its text agrees with the ArchaicDoctrine, as is shown in the creation of the Seven Creators and seven primitive men. As to Enoch, Thoth or Hermes,Orpheus and Kadmus, these are all generic names, branches and offshoots of the seven primordial sages (incarnatedDhyan Chohans or Devas, in illusive, not mortal bodies) who taught Humanity all it knew, and whose earliest disciplesassumed their master's names. This custom passed from the Fourth to the Fifth Race. Hence the sameness of the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"traditions about Hermes (of whom Egyptologists count five) Enoch, etc., they are all inventors of letters; none of them diesbut still lives, and they are the first Initiators into, and Founders of the Mysteries.

The \"Fall of the Angels,\" and the \"War in Heaven\" are repeated on every plane, the lower \"mirror\" disfiguringthe image of the superior mirror, and each repeating it in its own way. Thus the Christian dogmas are but thereminiscences of the paradigms of Plato, who spoke of these things cautiously, as every Initiate would. But it is all asexpressed in these few sentences of the Desatir:--\"All that is on Earth, saith the Lord (Ormazd), is the shadow of something that is in the superior spheres. This luminousobject (light, fire, etc.) is the shadow of that which is still more luminous than itself, and so on till it reaches ME, who amthe light of lights.\"In the Kabalistic books, and in the Zohar pre-eminently, the idea that everything objective on earth or in this Universe isthe Shadow -- Dyooknah -- of the eternal Light or Deity, is very strong.The Third Race was pre-eminently the bright shadow, at first, of the gods, whom tradition exiles on Earth after theallegorical war in Heaven; which became still more allegorical on Earth, for it was the war between spirit and matter. Thiswar will last till the inner and divine man adjusts his outer terrestrial self to his own spiritual nature. Till then the dark andfierce passions of the former will be at eternal feud with his master, the Divine Man. But the animal will be tamed one day,because its nature will be changed, and harmony will reign once more between the two as before the \"Fall,\" when evenmortal man was created by the Elements and was not born.The above is made clear in all the great theogonies, principally in the Grecian (see Hesiod and Theogony). The mutilationof Uranos by his son Kronos, who thus condemns him to impotency, has never been understood by the modernMythographers. Yet, it is very plain; and having been universal* (vide foot note infra), it must have contained a greatabstract[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] Postel saw it. It was most certainly in a great measure a transcript from thebooks of Hermes, and far anterior to the Books of Moses, as Eliphas Levi tells his readers.* Uranos is a modified Varuna, \"the Universal encompasser,\" the all-embracer, and one of the oldest of the Vedic deities -- SPACE, the maker of Heaven and Earth, since both are manifested out of his (or its) seed. It is only later that Varunabecame the chief of the Adityas and a kind of Neptune riding on the Leviathan -- Makara, now the most sacred andmysterious of the signs of the Zodiac. Varuna, \"without whom no creature can even wink,\" was degraded like Uranos,and, like him, he fell into generation, his functions, \"the grandest cosmical functions,\" as Muir calls them, having beenlowered down from heaven to earth by exoteric anthropomorphism. As the same [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 269 THE SYMBOLISM OF KRONOS.and philosophical idea, now lost to our modern sages. This punishment in the allegory marks, indeed \"a new period, asecond phase in the development of creation,\" as justly remarked by Decharme (Mythologie de la Grece Antique, p. 7),who, however, renounces the attempt to explain it. Uranos has tried to oppose an impediment to that development, ornatural evolution, by destroying all his children as soon as born. Uranos, who personifies all the creative powers of, andin, Chaos (Space, or the unmanifested Deity) is thus made to pay the penalty; for it is those powers which cause the Pitristo evolve primordial men from themselves -- as, later on, these men evolve their progeny -- without any sense or desirefor procreation. The work of generation, suspended during a moment, passes into the hands of Kronos,* time, who uniteshimself with Rhea (the earth in esotericism -- matter in general), and thus produces, after celestial -- terrestrial Titans. Thewhole of this symbolism relates to the mysteries of Evolution.This allegory is the exoteric version of the esoteric doctrine given in this part of our work. For in Kronos we see the samestory repeated again. As Uranos destroyed his children from Gaia (one, in the world of manifestation, with Aditi or theGreat Cosmic Deep) by confining them in the bosom of the Earth, Tythea, so Kronos at this second stage of creationdestroyed his children from Rhea -- by devouring them. This is an allusion to the fruitless efforts of Earth or Nature aloneto create real human men. (See our Stanzas III. -- X., et seq., and also Berosus' account of primeval creation.) Timeswallows its own fruitless work.

Only . . . \"his secretsand those of Mitra are not to be revealed to the foolish.\"* Kronos is not only [[Chronos]], time, but also, as Breal showed in his Hercule et Cacus (p. 57), comes from the root Kar,\"to make, to create.\" Whether Breal and Decharme, who quotes him, are as right in saying that in the Vedas Kronan is a"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"creative god, we have our doubts. Breal probably meant Karma, or rather Visva-Karma, the creative god, the \"Omnificent\"and the \"great Architect of the world.\"** The Titanic struggle, in theogony at least, is the fight for supremacy between the children of Uranos and Gaia (orHeaven and Earth in their abstract sense), the Titans, against the children of Kronos, whose chief is Zeus. It is theeverlasting struggle going on to this day between the spiritual inner man and the man of flesh, in one sense.*** Just as the \"Lord God,\" or Jehovah, is Cain esoterically, and the \"tempting serpent\" as well, the male portion of theandrogynous Eve, before her \"Fall;\" the female portion of Adam Kadmon; the left side or Binah of the right sideChochmah in the first Sephirothal Triad.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 270 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"Father of the Gods.\" He is the \"disrespectful son\" in Hesiod. Hermes calls him the \"Heavenly man\" (Pymander); andeven in the Bible he is found again under the name of Adam, and, later on -- by transmutation -- under that of Ham. Yetthese are all personifications of the \"sons of Wisdom.\" The necessary corroboration that Jupiter belongs to the purelyhuman Atlantean cycle -- if Uranus and Kronos who precede him are found insufficient -- may be found in Hesiod, whotells us that the Immortals have made men and created the Golden and the Silver age (First and Second Races); whileJupiter created the generations of Bronze (an admixture of two elements), of Heroes, and the men of the age of Iron.After this he sends his fatal present, by Pandora, to Epimetheus,* which present Hesiod calls \"a fatal gift,\" or the firstwoman. It was a punishment, he explains, sent to man \"for the theft of divine creative fire.\" Her apparition on earth is thesignal of every kind of evil. Before her appearance, the human races lived happy, exempt from sickness and suffering --as the same races are made to live under Yima's rule, in the Mazdean Vendidad.Two deluges may also be traced in universal tradition by carefully comparing Hesiod, the Rig Veda, the Zend-Avesta,etc., while no first man is ever mentioned in any of the theogonies save the Bible.** Everywhere the man of our raceappears after a cataclysm of water, after which tradition mentions only the several designations of continents and islandswhich sink under the ocean waves in due time.*** \"Gods and mortals have one common origin\" says Hesiod (ibid. v. 108);and Pindar echoes the statement (Nem. VI., 1). Deucalion and Pyrrha, who escape the Deluge by constructing an ark likeNoah's (see Apollod., 1, 7, 2, and Ovid, Metam. I, 260, 899.), ask Jupiter to re-animate the human race whom he hadmade to perish under the waters of the Flood. In the Slavonian Mythology (Lithuanian legend, in Grimm, Deutsche Myth.1, 545), all men were drowned, and two old people, a man and his wife, alone remained. Then Pram-gimas (the \"masterof all\") advised them to jump seven times on the rocks of the earth, and seven new races (couples) were born, from whichcame the nine Lithuanian tribes.

Gold, the most brilliant and precious of all, symbol of purity . . . . qualifies the first race. . . . . Themen of the second race, those of the age of Silver, are already inferior to the first. Inert and weak creatures, all their life isno better than a long and stupid infancy. . . . They disappear. . . . The men of the age of Bronze are robust and violent(the third race); their strength is extreme. They had arms made of bronze, habitations of bronze; used nought but bronze.Iron, the black metal, was yet unknown\" (Op. at D., 143-155). The fourth generation (race) is, with Hesiod, that of theheroes who fell before Thebes (see \"The Seven Against Thebes,\" by AEschylus), or under the walls of Troy.Thus, the four races being found mentioned by the oldest Greek poets, though very much confused anachronistically, ourdoctrines are once more corroborated by the classics. But this is all \"Mythology\" and poetry. What can modern sciencehave to say to such an euhemerization of old fictions? The verdict is not difficult to foresee. Therefore an attempt must bemade to answer by anticipation, and prove that fictions and empirical speculations are so much of the domain of thatsame science, that none of the men of learning have the slightest right, with such a heavy beam in their own eye, to pointto the speck in the eye of the Occultist, even if that speck be not a figment of our opponents' imagination.---------STANZA X. -- (Continued.)40.

One who has read and studied theCommentaries on the archaic doctrine, will easily recognise in some Atlanteans, the prototypes of the Nimrods, theBuilders of the Tower of Babel, the Hamites, and all these tutti quanti of \"accursed memory,\" as theological literatureexpresses it: of those, in short, who have furnished posterity with the orthodox types of Satan. And this leads us naturallyto inquire into the religious ethics of these early races, mythical as these may be.What was the religion of the Third and Fourth Races? In the common acceptation of the term, neither the Lemurians, noryet their progeny, the Lemuro-Atlanteans, had any, as they knew no dogma, nor had they to believe on faith. No soonerhad the mental eye of man been opened to understanding, than the Third Race felt itself one with the ever-present as theever to be unknown and invisible ALL, the One Universal Deity. Endowed with divine powers, and feeling in himself hisinner God, each felt he was a Man-God in his nature, though an animal in his physical Self. The struggle between the twobegan from the very day they tasted of the fruit of the Tree of Wisdom; a struggle for life between the spiritual and thepsychic, the psychic and the physical. Those who conquered the lower principles by obtaining mastery over the body,joined the \"Sons of Light.\" Those who fell victims to their lower natures, became the slaves of Matter. From \"Sons of Lightand Wisdom\" they ended by becoming the \"Sons of Darkness.\" They had fallen in the battle of mortal life with Lifeimmortal, and all those so fallen became the seed of the future generations of Atlanteans.*At the dawn of his consciousness, the man of the Third Root Race had thus no beliefs that could be called religion. Thatis to say, he was equally as ignorant of \"gay religions, full of pomp and gold\" as of any system of faith or outward worship.But if the term is to be defined as the binding together of the masses in one form of reverence paid to those we feelhigher than ourselves, of piety -- as a feeling expressed by a child toward a loved parent -- then even the earliestLemurians had a religion -- and a most beautiful one -- from the very beginning of their intellectual life.

We are assured it was so, and we believe it. For the evolutionof Spirit into matter could never have been achieved; nor would it have received its first impulse, had not the bright Spiritssacrificed their own respective super-ethereal essences to animate the man of clay, by endowing each of his innerprinciples with a portion, or rather, a reflection of that essence. The Dhyanis of the Seven Heavens (the seven planes ofBeing) are the NOUMENOI of the actual and the future Elements, just as the Angels of the Seven Powers of nature - thegrosser effects of which are perceived by us in what Science is pleased to call the \"modes of motion\" -- the imponderableforces and what not -- are the still higher noumenoi of still higher Hierarchies.It was the \"Golden Age\" in those days of old, the age when the \"gods walked the earth, and mixed freely with themortals.\" Since then, the gods departed (i.e., became invisible), and later generations ended by worshipping theirkingdoms -- the Elements.It was the Atlanteans, the first progeny of semi-divine man after his separation into sexes -- hence the first-begotten andhumanly-born mortals -- who became the first \"Sacrificers\" to the god of matter. They stand in the far-away dim past, inages more than prehistoric, as the prototype on which the great symbol of Cain was built,** as the first anthropomorphistswho worshipped form and matter. That worship degenerated very soon into self-worship, thence led to phallicism, or thatwhich reigns supreme to this day in the symbolisms of every exoteric religion of ritual, dogma, and form. Adam and Evebecame matter, or furnished the soil, Cain and Abel -- the latter the life-bearing soil, the former \"the tiller of that ground orfield.\"Thus the first Atlantean races, born on the Lemurian Continent, separated from their earliest tribes into the righteous andthe unrighteous; into those who worshipped the one unseen Spirit of Nature, the ray of which man feels within himself --or the Pantheists, and those who offered fanatical worship to the Spirits of the Earth, the dark Cosmic, anthropomorphicPowers, with whom they made alliance. These were the earliest Gibborim, \"the mighty men of renown in those[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The \"Gods of the Elements\" are by no means the Elementals.

At the same time this sexual religion was closely allied to, based upon and blended, soto say, with astronomical phenomena. The Lemurians gravitated toward the North Pole, or the Heaven of theirProgenitors (the Hyperborean Continent); the Atlanteans, toward the Southern Pole, the pit, cosmically and terrestrially --whence breathe the hot passions blown into hurricanes by the cosmic Elementals, whose abode it is. The two poles weredenominated, by the ancients, Dragons and Serpents -- hence good and bad Dragons and Serpents, and also the namesgiven to the \"Sons of God\" (Sons of Spirit and Matter): the good and bad Magicians. This is the origin of this dual andtriple nature in man. The legend of the \"Fallen Angels\" in its esoteric signification, contains the key to the manifoldcontradictions of human character; it points to the secret of man's self-consciousness; it is the angle-iron on which hingeshis entire life-cycle; -- the history of his evolution and growth.On a firm grasp of this doctrine depends the correct understanding of esoteric anthropogenesis. It gives a clue to thevexed question of the Origin of Evil; and shows how man himself is the separator of the ONE into various contrastedaspects. The reader, therefore, will not be surprised if so considerable space is devoted in each case to an attempt to elucidatethis difficult and obscure subject. A good deal must necessarily be said on its symbological aspect; because, by so doing,hints are given to the thoughtful student for his own investigations, and more light can thus be suggested than it ispossible to convey in the technical phrases of a more formal, philosophical exposition. The \"Fallen Angels,\" so-called, areHumanity itself. The Demon of Pride, Lust, Rebellion, and Hatred, has never had any being before the appearance ofphysical conscious man. It is man who has begotten, nurtured, and allowed the fiend to develop in his heart; he, again,who has contaminated the indwelling god in himself, by linking the pure spirit with the impure demon of matter. And, if theKabalistic saying, \"Demon est Deus inversus\" finds its metaphysical and theoretical corroboration in dual manifestednature, its practical application is found in Mankind alone.Thus it has now become self-evident that postulating as we do (a) the appearance of man before that of other mammalia,and even before the ages of the huge reptiles; (b) periodical deluges and glacial periods owing to the karmic disturbanceof the axis; and chiefly (c) the birth of man------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 275 NO DEVILS OUTSIDE HUMANITY.from a Superior Being, or what materialism would call a supernatural Being, though it is only super-human -- it is evidentthat our teachings have very few chances of an impartial hearing. Add to it the claim that a portion of the Mankind in theThird Race -- all those Monads of men who had reached the highest point of Merit and Karma in the precedingManvantara -- owed their psychic and rational natures to divine Beings hypostasizing into their fifth principles, and theSecret Doctrine must lose caste in the eyes of not only Materialism but even of dogmatic Christianity. For, no sooner willthe latter have learned that those angels are identical with their \"Fallen\" Spirits, than the esoteric tenet will be proclaimedmost terribly heretical and pernicious.* The divine man dwelt in the animal, and, therefore, when the physiologicalseparation took place in the natural course of evolution -- when also \"all the animal creation was untied,\" and males wereattracted to females -- that race fell: not because they had eaten of the fruit of Knowledge and knew good from evil, butbecause they knew no better. Propelled by the sexless creative instinct, the early sub-races had evolved an intermediaterace in which, as hinted in the Stanzas, the higher Dhyan-Chohans had incarnated.** \"When we have ascertained theextent of the Universe and learnt to know all that there is in it, we will multiply our race,\" answer the Sons of Will andYoga to their brethren of the same race, who invite them to do as they do. This means that the great Adepts and Initiatedascetics will \"multiply,\" i.e., once more produce Mind-born immaculate Sons -- in the Seventh Root-Race.It is so stated in the Puranas; in Adi Parvan (p. 115) and Brahma Purana, etc. In one portion of the Pushkara Mahatmya,moreover, the separation of the sexes is allegorized by Daksha, who, seeing that his will-born progeny (the \"Sons ofpassive Yoga\"), will not create men, \"converts half himself into a female by whom he begets daughters,\" the futurefemales of the Third Race which begat the giants of Atlantis,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is, perhaps, with an eye to this degradation of the highest and purest Spirits, who broke through the intermediateplanes of lower consciousness (the \"Seven circles of fire\" of Pymander), that St. James is made to say that \"this Wisdom(psuche in the original) descended not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish\"; and Psuche is Manas, the \"humansoul,\" the Spiritual Wisdom or Soul being Buddhi. Yet Buddhi per se, being so near the Absolute, is only latentconsciousness.** This is the \"undying race\" as it is called in Esotericism, and exoterically the fruitless generation of the first progeny ofDaksha, who curses Narada, the divine Rishi, alleged to have dissuaded the Haryaswas and the Sabalaswas, the sons ofDaksha, from procreating their species, by saying \"Be born in the womb; there shall not be a resting place for thee in allthese regions\"; after this Narada, the representative of that race of fruitless ascetics, is said, as soon as he dies in onebody, to be reborn in another.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 276 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Fourth Race, so called. In the Vishnu Purana it is simply said that Daksha, the father of mankind, established sexualintercourse as the means of peopling the world."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Happily for the human race the \"Elect Race\" had already become the vehicle of incarnation of the (intellectually andspiritually) highest Dhyanis before Humanity had become quite material. When the last sub-races -- save some lowest --of the Third Race had perished with the great Lemurian Continent, \"the seeds of the Trinity of Wisdom\" had alreadyacquired the secret of immortality on Earth, that gift which allows the same great personality to step ad libitum from oneworn-out body into another.(b) The first war that earth knew, the first human gore shed, was the result of man's eyes and senses being opened;which made him see that the daughters of his Brethren were fairer than his own, and their wives also. There were rapescommitted before that of the Sabines, and Menelauses robbed of their Helens before the Fifth Race was born. Titans orgiants were the stronger; their adversaries, the wiser. This took place during the Fourth Race -- that of the giants.For \"there were giants\" in the days of old, indeed* and the evolutionary series of the animal world is a warrant that thesame thing took place within the human races. Lower still in the order of creation we find witnesses for the same in theflora going pari passu with the fauna in respect of size. The pretty ferns we collect and dry among the leaves of ourfavourite volumes are the descendants of the gigantic ferns which grew during the carboniferous period.Scriptures, and fragments of philosophical and scientific works -- in short, almost every record that has come down to usfrom antiquity -- contain references to giants. No one can fail to recognize the Atlanteans of the Secret Doctrine in theRakshasas of Lanka -- the opponents conquered by Rama. Are these accounts no better than the production of emptyfancy? Let us give the subject a few moments of attention.-------[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The traditions of every country and nation point to this fact. Donnelly quotes from Father Duran's Historia Antigua de laNueva Espana of 1885, in which a native of Cholula, a centenarian, accounts for the building of the great pyramid ofCholula, by saying as follows: \"In the beginning, before the light of the Sun had been created, this land (Cholula) was inobscurity and darkness . . . . but immediately after the light of the Sun arose in the East, there appeared gigantic men . . .. who built the said pyramid, its builders being scattered after that to all parts of the Earth.\"\"A great deal of the Central American history is taken up with the doings of an ancient race of giants called Quinanes,\"says the author of \"Atlantis\" (p. 204.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 277 THE GIANTS.ARE GIANTS A FICTION?Here, again, we come into collision with Science. The latter denies, so far, that man has ever been much larger than theaverage of the tall and powerful men one meets with occasionally now. Dr. Henry Gregor denounces such traditions asresting upon ill-digested facts. Instances of mistaken judgments are brought forward. Thus, in 1613, in a locality calledfrom time immemorial the \"Field of Giants\" in the Lower Dauphine (France, four miles from St. Romans) enormous boneswere found deeply buried in the sandy soil. They were attributed to human remains, and even to Teutobochus, theTeuton chief slain by Marius. But Cuvier's later research proved them to be the fossil remains of the Dinotheriumgiganteum of the family of tapirs, 18 feet long. Ancient buildings are pointed to as an evidence that our earliest ancestorswere not much larger than we are, the entrance doors being of no larger size then than they are now. The tallest man ofantiquity known to us was the Roman Emperor Maximus, we are told, whose height was only seven and a half feet.Nevertheless, in our modern day we see every year men taller than this. The Hungarian who exhibited himself in theLondon Pavilion was nearly 9 feet high. In America a giant was shown 9 1/2 feet tall; the Montenegrin Danilo was 8 feet 7inches. In Russia and Germany one often sees men in the lower classes above 7 feet. And as the ape-theorists are toldby Mr. Darwin that the species of animals which result from cross breeding \"always betray a tendency to revert to theoriginal type,\" they ought to apply the same law to men. Had there been no giants as a rule in ancient days, there wouldbe none now.All this applies only to the historic period. And if the skeletons of the prehistoric ages have failed so far (which is positivelydenied) to prove undeniably in the opinion of science the claim here advanced, it is but a question of time. Moreover, asalready stated, human stature is little changed since the last racial cycle. The Giants of old are all buried under theOceans, and hundreds of thousands of years of constant friction by water would reduce to dust and pulverize a brazen,far more a human skeleton. But whence the testimony of well-known classical writers, of philosophers and men who,otherwise, never had the reputation for lying? Let us bear in mind, furthermore, that before the year 1847, when Boucherde Perthes forced it upon the attention of Science, almost nothing was known of fossil man, for archaeology complacentlyignored his existence. Of Giants who were \"in the earth in those days\" of old, the Bible alone had spoken to the wise menof the West, the Zodiac being the solitary witness called upon to corroborate the statement in the persons of Atlas orOrion, whose mighty shoulders are said to support the world.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 278 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Nevertheless, even the \"Giants\" have not been left without their witnesses, and one may as well examine both sides ofthe question. The three Sciences -- Geological, Sidereal and Scriptural (the latter in its Universal character) -- may furnishus with the needed proofs. To begin with geology; it has already confessed that the older the excavated skeletons, thelarger, taller and the more powerful their structure. This is already a certain proof in hand. \"All those bones\" writesFrederic de Rougemont -- who, though believing too piously in Noah's ark and the Bible, is none the less a Scientificwitness -- \"all those skeletons found in the Departments of the Gard, in Austria, Liege, etc., etc. . . those skulls whichremind all of the negro type. . . and which by reason of that type might be mistaken for animals, have all belonged to menof very high stature\" . . . (\"Histoire de la Terre,\" p. 154) The same is repeated by Lartet, an authority, who attributes a tall"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"stature to those who were submerged in the deluge (not necessarily \"Noah's\") and a smaller stature to the races whichlived subsequently.As for the evidence furnished by ancient writers, we need not stop at that of Tertullian, who assures us that in his day anumber of giants were found at Carthage -- for, before his testimony can be accepted, his own identity* and actualexistence would have to be proven. But we may turn to the scientific journals of 1858, which spoke of a sarcophagus ofgiants found that year on the site of that same city. As to the ancient pagan writers -- we have the evidence ofPhilostratus, who speaks of a giant skeleton twenty-two cubits long, as well as of another of twelve cubits, seen byhimself at Sigeus. This skeleton may perhaps not have belonged, as believed by Protesilaus, to the giant killed by Apolloat the siege of Troy; nevertheless, it was that of a giant, as well as that other one discovered by Messecrates of Stire, atLemnos -- \"horrible to behold,\" according to Philostratus (Heroica, p. 35). Is it possible that prejudice would carry Scienceso far as to class all these men as either fools or liars?Pliny speaks of a giant in whom he thought he recognised Orion, the son of Ephialtes (Nat. Hist., vol. VII, ch. xvi.).Plutarch declares that Sertorius saw the tomb of Antaeus, the giant; and Pausanias vouches for the actual existence ofthe tombs of Asterius and of Geryon, or Hillus, son of Hercules -- all giants, Titans and mighty men. Finally the AbbePegues (cited in de Mirville's Pneumatologie) affirms in his curious work on \"The Volcanoes of Greece\" that \"in theneighbourhood of the volcanoes of the isle of Thera, giants with enormous skulls were found laid out under colossalstones, the erection of which must have necessi-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* There are critics who, finding no evidence about the existence of Tertullian save in the writings of Eusebius \"theveracious,\" are inclined to doubt it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 279 CHRISTENDOM IS IDOLATROUS.tated everywhere the use of titanic powers, and which tradition associates in all countries with the ideas about giants,volcanoes and magic.\" (Page 48.)In the same work above cited of the Abbe Pegues, the author wonders why in Bible and tradition the Gibborim, (Giants,the mighty ones) the Rephaim, or the spectres (Phantoms), the Nephilim, or the fallen ones -- (irruentes) -- are shown \"asif identical, though they are all men, since the Bible calls them the primitive and the mighty ones\" -- e.g., Nimrod. The\"Doctrine\" explains the secret. These names, which belong by right only to the four preceding races and the earliestbeginning of the Fifth, allude very clearly to the first two Phantom (astral) races; to the fallen one -- the Third; and to therace of the Atlantean Giants -- the Fourth, after which \"men began to decrease in stature.\"Bossuet (Elevations p. 56) sees the cause of subsequent universal idolatry in the \"original sin.\" \"Ye shall be as gods,\"says the serpent of Genesis to Eve, thus laying the first germ of the worship of false divinities. Hence, he thinks, cameidolatry, or the cult and adoration of images, of anthropomorphized or human figures. But, if it is the latter that idolatry ismade to rest upon, then the two Churches, the Greek and the Latin especially, are as idolatrous and pagan as any otherreligion.* It is only in the Fourth Race that men, who had lost all right to be considered divine, resorted to body worship, inother words to phallicism. Till then, they had been truly gods, as pure and as divine as their progenitors, and theexpression of the allegorical serpent does not, as sufficiently shown in the preceding pages, refer at all to thephysiological fall of men, but to their acquiring the knowledge of good and evil, which knowledge comes to them prior totheir fall. It must not be forgotten that it is only after his forced expulsion from Eden that \"Adam knew Eve his wife\"(Genesis iv.). It is not, however, by the dead-letter of the Hebrew Bible that we shall check the tenets of the SecretDoctrine; but point out, rather, the great similarities between the two in their esoteric meaning.It is only after his defection from the Neo-Platonists, that Clement[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* And that, notwithstanding the formal prohibition at the great Church Council of Elyrus in A.D. 303, when it was declaredthat \"the form of God, which is immaterial and invisible, shall not be limited by figure or shape.\" In 692, the council ofConstantinople had similarly prohibited \"to paint or represent Jesus as a lamb,\" as also \"to bow the knee in praying, as itis the act of idolatry.\" But the council of Nicaea (787) brought this idolatry back, while that of Rome (883)excommunicated John, the Patriarch of Constantinople, for his showing himself a declared enemy of image worship.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 280 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of Alexandria began to translate gigantes by serpentes, explaining that \"Serpents and Giants signify Demons.\" (Genesis,chapter v.)*We may be told that, before we draw parallels between our tenets and those of the Bible, we have to show betterevidence of the existence of the giants of the Fourth Race than the reference to them found in Genesis. We answer, thatthe proofs we give are more satisfactory, at any rate they belong to a more literary and scientific evidence, than those ofNoah's Deluge will ever be. Even the historical works of China are full of such reminiscences about the Fourth Race. InShoo-King (4th part, chap. XXVII, p. 291), anyone can read in the French translation, \"When the Mao-tse\" (\"thatantediluvian and perverted race,\" explains the Annotator, \"which had retired in the days of old to the rocky caves, and thedescendants of whom are said to be still found in the neighbourhood of Canton\"),**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Treating of the Chinese Dragon and the literature of China, Mr. Ch.

It is stated already elsewhere, that the great \"magicians\" of the Fourth and Fifth Races weregenerally called the \"Serpents\" and the \"Dragons\" after their progenitors. All these belonged to the hierarchy of the so-called \"Fiery Dragons of Wisdom,\" the Dhyan Chohans, answering to the Agnishwatta Pitris, the Maruts and Rudrasgenerally, as the issue of Rudra their father, identified with the god of fire. More is said in the text. Now Clement, aninitiated Neo-Platonist, knew, of course, the origin of the word \"Dragon,\" and why the initiated Adepts were so-called, ashe knew the secret of Agathodaemon, the Christ, the seven-vowelled Serpent of the Gnostics. He knew that the dogma ofhis new faith required the transformation of all the rivals of Jehovah, the angels supposed to have rebelled against thatElohim as the Titan-Prometheus rebelled against Zeus, the usurper of his father's kingdom; and that \"Dragon\" was themystic appellation of the \"Sons of Wisdom\"; from this knowledge came his definition, as cruel as it was arbitrary,\"Serpents and Giants signify Demons,\" i.e., not \"Spirits,\" but Devils, in Church parlance.** \"What would you say to our affirmation that the Chinese -- I speak of the inland, the true Chinaman, not of the hybridmixture between the Fourth and Fifth Races now occupying the throne, the aborigines who belong in their unalliednationality wholly to the highest and last branch of the Fourth Race -- reached their highest civilization when the Fifth hadhardly appeared in Asia\" (Esoteric Buddhism, p. 67).

Not being in aposition to give out a full and detailed history of the Third and Fourth Races, as many isolated facts concerning them asare permitted must be now collated together; especially those corroborated by direct as well as by inferential evidencefound in ancient literature and history. As the \"coats of skin\" of men thickened, and they fell more and more into physicalsin, the intercourse between physical and ethereal divine man was stopped. The veil of matter between the two planesbecame too dense for even the inner man to penetrate. The mysteries of Heaven and Earth, revealed to the Third Raceby their celestial teachers in the days of their purity, became a great focus of light, the rays from which becamenecessarily weakened as they were diffused and shed upon an uncongenial, because too material soil.

It is the spirit of Divine Wisdom and chaste asceticism itself whichincarnates in these Elect.

Thus, it is said in line 12 that the \"Lord of the earth hisname called out, the father Elu\" (Elohim), and pronounced his curse, which \"The God Hea heard, and his liver was angry,because his man (Angelic man) had corrupted his purity (14 and 15),\" for which Hea expresses the desire that \" 'Wisdomand knowledge' hostilely may they injure him (man).\"The latter sentence points to the direct connection of the Chaldean with the Genetic account. While Hea tries to bring tonought the wisdom and knowledge gained by man, through his newly-acquired intellectual and conscious capacity ofcreating in his turn (thus taking the monopoly of creation out of the hands of God (the Gods)), the Elohim do the same inthe third chapter of Genesis. Therefore the Elohim sent him out of Eden.But this was of no avail.

Every ancient Scripture has the same, more or less disfigured legend. Primarily,the angelic Fall, which has transformed the \"first-born\" of God into the Asuras, or into the Ahriman and Typhon of the\"pagans\" (i.e., if the accounts given in the Book of Enoch,* and in Hermes, in Puranas and Bible are taken literally), whenread esoterically means simply this:--Sentences such as: \"In his (Satan's) ambition he raises his hand against the Sanctuary of the God of Heaven\" etc., oughtto read: \"Prompted by the law of eternal evolution and Karma, the angel incarnated on earth in man; and as his Wisdomand Knowledge are still divine, although his body is earthly, he is (allegorically) accused of divulging the mysteries ofHeaven.\" He combines and uses the two for purposes of human, instead of super-human, procreation.

Like allother fire or light gods -- fire burning and destroying as well as warming and giving life -- he ended by being accepted inthe destructive sense of \"fire.\" The name Loki, we learn (\"Asgard and the Gods,\" p. 250), has been derived from the oldword \"liechan,\" to enlighten. It has, therefore, the same origin as the Latin \"lux, light.\" Hence Loki is identical with Lucifer(light-bringer). This title, given to the Prince of Darkness, is very suggestive and is a vindication in itself againsttheological slander. But Loki is still more closely related to Prometheus, as he is shown chained to a sharp rock, whileLucifer, identified with Satan, was chained down in hell; a circumstance, however, which prevented neither of them fromacting in all freedom on Earth, if we accept the theological paradox in its fulness. Loki is a beneficent, generous andpowerful god in the beginning of times, and the principle of good, not of evil, in early Scandinavian theogony. ** The Greek mythos just alluded to a few pages back, namely the mutilation of Uranos by his son Kronos in the Greektheogony, is an allusion to this theft by the Son of the Earth and Heavens of the divine creative fire. If Uranos, thepersonification of the celestial Powers, has to stop creating (he is made impotent by Kronos, the god in time) so, in theEgyptian Cosmogony it is Thot, the god of Wisdom, who regulates this fight between Horus and Set, the latter beingserved by the former as Uranos is by Kronos (see \"Book of the Dead\" ch. XVII. V. 26). In the Babylonian account it is thegod Zu, who strips \"the father of the gods\" of umsimi -- the ideal creative organ not the crown (!) as G. Smith thought (seepp. 115 and 116 Chaldean Account). For, in the fragment K. 3454 (British Museum) it is said very clearly, that Zu havingstripped the \"venerable [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 284 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.his weak body as the means of procreation, that body will pay the penalty for this wisdom, carried from heaven down tothe earth; hence the corruption of physical purity will become a temporary curse.The mediaeval Kabalists knew this well, since one of them did not fear to write: \"The Kabala was first taught by Godhimself to a select Company of Angels who formed a theosophic school in Paradise. After the FALL the Angels mostgraciously communicated this heavenly doctrine to the disobedient child of Earth, to furnish the protoplasts with themeans of returning to their pristine nobility and felicity\" (Quoted by Christian Ginsburg from the Kabala). This shows howthe event -- of the Sons of God, marrying and imparting the divine Secrets of Heaven to the daughters of men --allegorically told by Enoch and in the sixth chapter of Genesis was interpreted by the Christian Kabalists. The whole ofthis period may be regarded as the pre-human period, that of divine man, or as plastic Protestant theology now has it --the pre-adamite period. But even Genesis begins its real history (chap. vi.) by the giants of \"those days\" and the \"Sons ofgod\" marrying and teaching their wives -- the daughters of man."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"This period is the one described in the Puranas; and relating as it does to days lost in archaic ages, hence pre-historic,how can any anthropologist feel certain whether the mankind of that period was or was not as he knows it now? Thewhole personnel of the Brahmanas and Puranas -- the Rishis, Prajapatis, Manus, their wives and progeny -- belong tothat pre-human period. All these are the Seed of Humanity, so to speak. It is around these \"Sons of God,\" the \"Mind born\"astral children of Brahma, that our physical frames have grown and developed to what they are now. For, the Puranichistories of all those men are those of our Monads, in their various and numberless incarnations on this and otherspheres, events perceived by the \"Siva eye\" of the ancient Seers, (the \"third eye\" of our Stanzas) and describedallegorically. Later on, they were disfigured for Sectarian purposes; mutilated, but still left with a considerable ground-work of truth in them. Nor is the philosophy less profound in such allegories for being so thickly veiled by the overgrowthof fancy.But with the Fourth Race we reach the purely human period.

These beings in female forms (Lilith is theprototype of these in the Jewish traditions) are called in the esoteric accounts \"Khado\" (Dakini, in Sanskrit). Allegoricallegends call the chief of these Liliths, Sangye Khado, (Buddha Dakini, in Sanskrit); all are credited with the art of \"walkingin the air,\" and the greatest kindness to mortals; but no mind -- only animal instinct.*(c) This is the beginning of a worship which, ages later, was doomed to degenerate into phallicism and sexual worship. Itbegan by the worship of the human body -- that \"miracle of miracles,\" as an English author calls it -- and ended by that ofits respective sexes. The worshippers were giants in stature; but they were giants in knowledge and learning, though itcame to them more easily than it does to the men of our modern times. Their Science was innate in them. The Lemuro-Atlantean had no need of discovering and fixing in his memory that which his informing PRINCIPLE knew at the momentof its incarnation. Time alone, and the ever-growing obtuseness of the matter in which the Principles had clothedthemselves, could, the one, weaken the memory of their pre-natal knowledge, the other, blunt and even extinguish everyspark of the spiritual and divine in them. Therefore had they, from the first, fallen victims to their animal natures and bred\"monsters\" -- i.e., men of distinct varieties from themselves.Speaking of the Giants, Creuzer describes them well in saying that:--\"Those children of Heaven and Earth were endowed at their birth by the Sovereign Powers, the authors of their being,with extraordinary faculties both moral and physical. They commanded the Elements, knew the secrets of heaven and theearth, of the sea and the whole world, and read futurity in the stars. . . . It seems, indeed, as though one has to deal,when reading of them, not with men as we are but with Spirits of the Elements sprung from the bosom of Nature andhaving full sway over her. . . . All these beings are marked with a character of MAGIC and SORCERY. . . . \"And so they were, those (now) legendary heroes of the pre-historic, still, once really existing races. Creuzer was wise inhis generation, for he did not charge with deliberate deceit, or dullness and superstition, an endless series of recognizedphilosophers, who mention these races and assert that, even in their own time, they saw their fossils. There were scepticsin days of old -- no fewer and as great as they are now. But even a Lucian, a Democritus and an Epicurus yielded to theevidence of facts and showed the discriminative capacity of really[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* These are the beings whose legendary existence has served as a ground-work upon which to build the rabbinical Lilith,and what the believers in the Bible would term the antediluvian women, and the Kabalists the pre-Adamite races. Theyare no fiction -- this is certain, however fantastic the exuberance of later growth.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 286 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.great intellects, which can distinguish fiction from fact, and truth from exaggeration and fraud. Ancient writers were nomore fools than our modern wise men are; for, as well remarked by the author of some \"Notes on Aristotle's Psychologyin Relation to Modern Thought\" (in Mind):-- \"The common division of history into ancient and modern is . . . . misleading. The Greeks in the 4th century, B.C. were inmany respects moderns especially, we may add, in their scepticism. They were not very likely to accept fables so easily .. . . .\" Yet the \"Lemurians\" and the Atlanteans, \"those children of Heaven and Earth,\" were indeed marked with a character ofSORCERY; for the Esoteric doctrine charges them precisely with that, which, if believed, would put an end to thedifficulties of science with regard to the origin of man, or rather, his anatomical similarities to the Anthropoid Ape. Itaccuses them of having committed the (to us) abominable crime of breeding with so-called \"animals,\" and thus producinga truly pithecoid species, now extinct. Of course, as in the question of spontaneous generation -- in which EsotericScience believes, and which it teaches -- the possibility of such a cross-breed between man and an animal of any kindwill be denied. But apart from the consideration that in those early days, as already remarked, neither the humanAtlantean giants, nor yet the \"animals,\" were the physiologically perfect men and mammalians that are now known to us,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"the modern notions upon this subject -- those of the physiologists included -- are too uncertain and fluctuating to permitthem an absolute denial a priori of such a fact.A careful perusal of the Commentaries would make one think that the Being that the new \"incarnate\" bred with, wascalled an \"animal,\" not because he was no human being, but rather because he was so dissimilar physically and mentallyto the more perfect races, which had developed physiologically at an earlier period. Remember Stanza VII. and what issaid in its first verse (24th):-- that when the \"Sons of Wisdom\" came to incarnate the first time, some of them incarnatedfully, others projected into the forms only a spark, while some of the shadows were left over from being filled andperfected, till the Fourth Race. Those races, then, which \"remained destitute of knowledge,\" or those again which wereleft \"mindless,\" remained as they were, even after the natural separation of the sexes. It is these who committed the firstcross-breeding, so to speak, and bred monsters; and it is from the descendants of these that the Atlanteans chose theirwives. Adam and Eve were supposed, with Cain and Abel, to be the only human family on Earth. Yet we see Cain goingto the land of Nod and taking there a wife. Evidently one race only was supposed perfect enough to be called human;and, even in our own day, while the Singhalese------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 287 THE RACES OF MEN NOT ALL HUMAN.regard the Veddhas of their jungles as speaking animals and no more, some British people believe firmly, in theirarrogance, that every other human family -- especially the dark Indians -- is an inferior race. Moreover there arenaturalists who have sincerely considered the problem whether some savage tribes -- like the Bushmen for instance --can be regarded as men at all. The Commentary says, in describing that species (or race) of animals \"fair to look at\" as abiped:-- \"Having human shape, but having the lower extremities, from the waist down, covered with hair.\" Hence the raceof the satyrs, perhaps.If men existed two million years ago, they must have been -- just as the animals were -- quite different physically andanatomically from what they have become; and they were nearer then to the type of pure mammalian animal than theyare now. Anyhow, we learn that the animal world breeds strictly inter se, i.e., in accordance with genus and species --only since the appearance on this earth of the Atlantean race. As demonstrated by the author of that able work, \"ModernScience and Modern Thought,\" this idea of the refusal to breed with another species, or that sterility is the only result ofsuch breeding, \"appears to be a prima facie deduction rather than an absolute law\" even now. He shows that \"differentspecies, do, in fact, often breed together, as may be seen in the familiar instance of the horse and ass. It is true that inthis case the mule is sterile. . . . but this rule is not universal, and recently one new hybrid race, that of the leporine, orhare-rabbit, has been created which is perfectly fertile.\" The progeny of wolf and dog is also instanced, as that of severalother domestic animals (p. 101); \"like foxes and dogs again, and the modern Swiss cattle shown by Rutimeyer asdescended from three distinct species of fossil-oxen, the Bos primigenius, Bos longifrons and Bos frontosus.\" Yet some ofthose species, as the ape family, which so clearly resembles man in physical structure, contain, we are told, \"numerousbranches, which graduate into one another, but the extremes of which differ more widely than man does from the highestof the ape series\" -- the gorilla and chimpanzee, for instance (see Addenda).Thus Mr. Darwin's remark -- or shall we say the remark of Linnaeus? -- natura non facit saltum, is not only corroboratedby Esoteric Science but would -- were there any chance of the real doctrine being accepted by any others than its directvotaries -- reconcile in more than one way, if not entirely, the modern Evolution theory with facts, as also with the absolutefailure of the Anthropologists to meet with the \"missing link\" in our Fourth Round geological formations.We will show elsewhere that, however unconsciously to itself, modern Science pleads our case upon its own admissions,and that de Quatrefages is perfectly right, when he suggests in his last work, that it is far more likely that the anthropoidape should be discovered to be------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 288 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the descendant of man, than that these two types should have a common, fantastic and nowhere-to-be-found ancestor.Thus the wisdom of the compilers of the old Stanzas is vindicated by at least one eminent man of Science, and theOccultist prefers to believe as he ever did that --\"Man was the first and highest (mammalian) animal that appeared in this (Fourth Round) creation. Then came still hugeranimals; and last of all the dumb man who walks on all fours.\" For, \"the Rakshasas (giant-demons) and Daityas (Titans)of the \"White Dwipa\" (continent) spoiled his (the dumb man's) Sires.\" (Commentary.)Furthermore, as we see, there are anthropologists who have traced man back to an epoch which goes far to break downthe apparent barrier that exists between the chronologies of modern science and the Archaic Doctrine. It is true thatEnglish scientists generally have declined to commit themselves to the sanction of the hypothesis of even a Tertiary Man.They, each and all, measure the antiquity of Homo primigenius by their own lights and prejudices. Huxley, indeed,ventures to speculate on a possible Pliocene or Miocene Man. Prof. Seeman and Mr. Grant Allen have relegated hisadvent to the Eocene, but, speaking generally, English scientists consider that we cannot safely go beyond thequaternary. Unfortunately, the facts do not accommodate the too cautious reserve of these latter. The French school ofanthropology, basing their views on the discoveries of l'Abbe Bourgeois, Capellini, and others, has accepted, almostwithout exception, the doctrine that the traces of our ancestors are certainly to be found in the Miocene, while M. deQuatrefages now inclines to postulate a Secondary-Age Man. Further on we shall compare such estimates with thefigures given in the Brahminical exoteric books which approximate to the esoteric teaching.(d) . . . . Then, \"the third eye acted no longer,\" says the Stanza, because MAN had sunk too deep into the mire of matter.What is the meaning of this strange and weird statement in Verse 42, concerning the \"third eye of the Third Race whichhad died and acted no longer\"?"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"A few more occult teachings must now be given with reference to this point as well as some others. The history of theThird and Fourth Races must be amplified, in order that it may throw some more light on the development of our presenthumanity; and show how the faculties, called into activity by occult training, restore man to the position he previouslyoccupied in reference to spiritual perception and consciousness.

While turning the light of the bull's eye calledesotericism on almost every inch of the occult grounds travelled over, we have also to use its lens to throw into strongerobjectivity the regions explored by exact science; this, not only in order to contrast the two, but to defend our position.*It may be complained by some that too little is said of the physical, human side of the extinct races, in this history of theirgrowth and evolution. Much more might be said assuredly, if simple prudence did not make us hesitate at the threshold ofevery new revelation. That, which finds its possibility and landmarks in the discoveries of modern science, is given; allthat of which exact knowledge knows nothing and upon which it is unable to speculate -- and therefore denies as facts innature -- is withheld.But even such statements as these -- e.g., that of all the mammalians, man was the earliest; that it is man who is theindirect ancestor of the Ape; and that he was a kind of a Cyclops in days of old -- will all be contested, yet, scientists willnever be able to prove -- except to their own satisfaction -- that it was not so. Nor can they admit that the first two races ofmen were too ethereal and phantom-like in their constitution, organism, and shape, even to be called physical men. For, ifthey do, it will be found that this is one of the reasons why their relics can never be expected to be exhumed among otherfossils. Nevertheless all this is maintained. Man was the store-house, so to speak, of all the seeds of life[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For suggestiveness, we would recommend a short article in the Theosophist of August, 1887, \"Esoteric Studies.\" Itsauthor expounds therein quite an occult theory, though to the world a new idea: \"the progress of the Monad concurringwith the retrogression of Form\" (666), i.e., \"with decrease of the vis formativa.\" He says, \"Who knows what shapevehicled the Ego in remote rings (Rounds, or races?) . . . ? May not man's type have been that of the Simiadae in itsvariety? Might not the monkey-kingdom of Ramayana fame rest on some far-off tradition relating to a period when thatwas the common lot, or rather aspect, of man?\" . . . and winds up a very clever, though too short, exposition of his theoryby saying that which every true occultist will endorse: \"With physico-ethereal man there must be involution of sex. Asphysico-astral man depended on entities of the sub-human class (evolved from animal prototypes) for rebirth, so willphysico-ethereal man find among the graceful, shapely orders issuing from the air-plane, one or more which will bedeveloped for his successive embodiments when procreated forms are given -- a process which will include all mankindonly very gradually. The (pre?) Adamic and post-Adamic races were giants; their ethereal counterparts may possibly beliliputians -- beauteous, luminous, diaphanous -- but will assuredly be giants in mind\" (p. 671, art. by Visconde deFiganiere, F.T.S.).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 290 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.for this Round, vegetable and animal alike.* As En-Soph is \"One, notwithstanding the innumerable forms which are inhim\" (Zohar,\" i. 2la), so is man, on Earth the microcosm of the macrocosm. \"As soon as man appeared, everything wascomplete. . . . for everything is comprised in man. He unites in himself all forms (Ibid., iii. 48a).\" \"The mystery of theearthly man is after the mystery of the Heavenly Man\" (ii. 76a). The human form -- so called, because it is the vehicle(under whatever shape) of the divine man -- is, as so intuitionally remarked by the author of \"Esoteric Studies,\"** the newtype, at the beginning of every Round, \"as man never can be, so he never has been, manifested in a shape belonging tothe animal kingdom in esse.\" The author proceeds, \"he never formed part of that kingdom. Derived, only derived, from themost finished class of the latter, a new human form must always have been the new type of the cycle. The human shape,in one ring (?), as I imagine, becomes cast-off clothes in the next; it is then appropriated by the highest order in theservant-kingdom below.\"If the idea is what we understand it to mean -- for the \"rings\" spoken of throw some confusion upon it -- then it is thecorrect esoteric teaching. Having appeared at the very beginning, and at the head of sentient and conscious life, man (theastral, or the \"Soul,\" for the Zohar, repeating the archaic teaching, distinctly says that \"the real man is the Soul, and hismaterial frame no part of him\") -- man became the living and animal UNIT, from which the \"cast-off clothes\" determinedthe shape of every life and animal in this Round.***Thus, he \"created\" for ages the insects, reptiles, birds, and animals, unconsciously to himself, from his remains and relicsfrom the Third and the Fourth Rounds. The same idea and teaching are as distinctly given in the Vendidad of theMazdeans, as they are in the Chaldean and the Mosaic allegory of the Ark, all of which are the many national versions ofthe original legend given in the Hindu Scriptures. It is found in the allegory of Vaivasvata Manu and his Ark with theSeven Rishis, as in that of the Rishis, each of whom is shown the father and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It may be objected that this is a contradiction. That, as the first Root-Race appeared 300,000,000 years after thevegetation had evolved, the seed of vegetable life could not be in the First Race.

Open the MazdeanVendidad, at Fargard ii., at verse 27 (73) and read the command of Ormazd to Yima, a Spirit of the Earth, whosymbolizes the three races, after telling him to build a vara (\"an enclosure,\" an argua or vehicle) . . . .\"Thither (into the vara) thou shalt bring the seeds of men and women, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth;thither thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of cattle,\" etc., etc.; and v. 28 (74) . . . .\"all those seeds shalt thou bring,two of every kind, to be kept inexhaustible there, so long as those men shall stay in the vara.\" Those \"men\" in the \"Vara\"are the \"Progenitors,\" the heavenly men or Dhyani, the future Egos who are commissioned to inform mankind. For \"Vara,\"or the \"Ark\" (or again the Vehicle) simply means MAN.* Verse 30 says: . . . . \"thou shalt seal up the vara (after filling it upwith the seeds), and thou shalt make a door and a window self-shining within,\" which is the Soul. And when Yima inquiresof Ahura Mazda how he shall manage to make that vara, he is answered: \"Crush the earth . . . and knead it with thyhands, as the potter does when kneading the potter's clay\" (31).The Egyptian ram-headed god makes man of clay on a potter's wheel, and so in Genesis do the Elohim fashion him outof the same material.When the \"Maker of the material world\" (Ahura Mazda) is asked, furthermore, what is to give light \"to the Vara which Yimamade,\" he is told that \"There are uncreated lights and created lights\" and that \"there\" (in Airyana Vaego, where Vara isbuilt), \"the stars, the moon, and the Sun are only once (a year) seen to rise and set\" and a year seems only as a day (andnight) a clear reference to the \"land of the Gods\" or the (now) polar regions. Moreover another hint is contained in thisverse: a distinct allusion to the \"uncreated lights\" which enlighten man within -- his principles. Otherwise, no sense orreason could be found in Ahura Mazda's answer (V. 40), which is forthwith followed by Verse 41 saying that \"Everyfortieth year, to every couple (hermaphrodite) two are born, a male and female,\"** the latter being a distinct echo of theSecret Doctrine, of a Stanza which says --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This is the meaning when the allegory and symbol are opened and read by means of the human key, or the key toterrestrial anthroposophy. This interpretation of the \"ark\" symbolism does not in the least interfere with its astronomical, oreven theogonic keys; nor with any of the other six meanings. Nor does it seem less scientific than the modern theoriesabout the origin of man. As said, it has seven keys to it, like the rest.** Vendidad Sadah, See also Bund. XV.; and J. Darmesteter's translation of the Vendidad. \"Sacred Books of the East.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 292 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"At the expiration of every forty (annual) Suns, at the end of every fortieth Day, the double one becomes four; male andfemale in one, in the first and second and the third. . . . . .\"Which is clear, since \"every sun\" meant a whole year, the latter being composed of one day then, as in the arctic circle itis now composed of six months. According to the old teaching, the axis of the earth gradually changes its inclination tothe ecliptic, and at the period referred to, this inclination was such that a polar day lasted during the whole period of theearth's revolution about the sun, when a kind of twilight of very short duration intervened; after which the polar landresumed its position directly under the solar rays. This may be contrary to astronomy as now taught and understood: butwho can say that changes in the motion of the earth, which do not take place now, did not occur millions of years back?Returning once more to the statement that Vara meant the MAN of the Fourth Round, as much as the Earth of thosedays, the moon, and even Noah's ark, if one will so have it -- this is again shown in the dialogue between Ahura Mazdaand Zarathustra. Thus when the latter asks --V. 42. \"O Maker of the Material World, thou Holy One! Who is he who brought the law of Mazda into the Vara which Yimamade?\"\"Ahura Mazda answered: 'It was the bird Karshipta, O holy Zarathustra.' . . . .\"\"The bird Karshipta dwells in the heavens: were he living on the earth he would be king of birds. He brought into the varof Yima, and recites the Avesta in the language of birds.\" (Bund. xix and xxiv.)This again is an allegory and a symbol misunderstood by the Orientalists only, who see in this bird \"an incarnation oflightning,\" and say its song was \"often thought to be the utterance of a god and a revelation,\" and what not. Karshipta isthe human mind-soul, and the deity thereof, symbolized in ancient Magianism by a bird, as the Greeks symbolized it by abutterfly. No sooner had Karshipta entered the Vara or man, than he understood the law of Mazda, or Divine Wisdom. Inthe \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" it is said of the tree, which is the tree of knowledge of good and evil: \"In its branches (ofthe tree) the birds lodge and build their nests,\" or the Souls and the Angels have their place!.* Therefore, with theKabalists it was a like symbol. \"Bird\" was a Chaldean, and has become a Hebrew synonym and symbol for Angel, a Soul,"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"a Spirit, or Deva; and the \"Bird's Nest\" was with both Heaven, and is God's bosom in the Zohar.

And that \"tree hath around it seven columns (seven pillars) of the world, or Rectores\"; the same \"Progenitors\"or \"Sephiroth\" again \"operating through the respective orders of Angels in the spheres of the seven planets,\" etc., one ofwhich orders begets giants (Nephilim) on Earth.It was the belief of entire antiquity, Pagan and Christian, that the earliest mankind was a race of giants. Certainexcavations in America in mounds and in caves, have already yielded in isolated cases groups of skeletons of nine andtwelve feet high.* These belong to tribes of the early Fifth Race, now degenerated to an average size of between five andsix feet. But we can easily believe that the Titans and Cyclopes of old really belonged to the Fourth (Atlantean) Race, andthat all the subsequent legends and allegories found in the Hindu Puranas and the Greek Hesiod and Homer, were basedon the hazy reminiscences of real Titans -- men of a superhuman tremendous physical power, which enabled them todefend themselves, and hold at bay the gigantic monsters of the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic times -- and of actualCyclopes -- three-eyed mortals.It has been often remarked by observant writers, that the \"origin of nearly every popular myth and legend could be tracedinvariably to a fact in Nature.\"In these fantastic creations of an exuberant subjectivism, there is always an element of the objective and real. Theimagination of the masses, disorderly and ill-regulated as it may be, could never have conceived and fabricated ex nihiloso many monstrous figures, such a wealth of extraordinary tales, had it not had, to serve it as a central nucleus, thosefloating reminiscences, obscure and vague, which unite the broken links of the chain of time to form with them themysterious, dream foundation of our collective consciousness.**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Darwinian Evolutionists who are so wont to refer to the evidence of reversion to type -- the full meaning of which, in thecase of human monsters, is embraced in the esoteric solution of the embryological problem -- as proof of their arguments,would do well to inquire into those instances of modern giants who are often 8, 9, and even 11 feet high. Such reversionsare imperfect, yet undeniable reproductions of the original towering man of primeval times.** See \"Mythical Monsters,\" by Ch. Gould, from whose interesting and scientific volume a few passages are quotedfurther on. See in Mr. Sinnett's \"Occult World,\" the description of a cavern in the Himalayas filled with relics of human andanimal giant bones.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 294 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The evidence for the Cyclopes -- a race of giants -- will be pointed out in forthcoming Sections, in the Cyclopeanremnants, so called to this day. An indication that, during its evolution and before the final adjustment of the humanorganism -- which became perfect and symmetrical only in the Fifth Race -- the early Fourth Race may have been three-eyed, without having necessarily a third eye in the middle of the brow, like the legendary Cyclops, is also furnished byScience.To the Occultists who believe that spiritual and psychic involution proceeds on parallel lines with physical evolution; thatthe inner senses -- innate in the first human races -- atrophied during racial growth and the material development of theouter senses; to the student of Esoteric symbology, finally, this statement is no conjecture or possibility, but simply aphase of the law of growth, a proven fact, in short. They understand the meaning of this passage in the Commentarieswhich says:--\"There were four-armed human creatures in those early days of the male-females (hermaphrodites); with one head, yetthree eyes. They could see before them and behind them.* A KALPA later (after the separation of the sexes) men havingfallen into matter, their spiritual vision became dim; and coordinately the third eye commenced to lose its power. . . .When the Fourth (Race) arrived at its middle age, the inner vision had to be awakened, and acquired by artificial stimuli,the process of which was known to the old sages.** . . . The third eye, likewise, getting gradually PETRIFIED,*** soondisappeared. The double-faced became the one-faced, and the eye was drawn deep into the head and is now buriedunder the hair.

TheArhat sees and feels it, and regulates his action accordingly. . . . . . . . . . . . . .[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Viz., the third eye was at the back of the head. The statement that the latest hermaphrodite humanity was \"four-armed,\"unriddles probably the mystery of all the representations and idols of the exoteric gods of India.

The head of the \"god\" has two eyes in its face and one"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"above on the top of the forehead. It is considered the most archaic of all the ancient statues (Schol. Vatic. ad Eurip.Troad. 14).** The Inner sight could henceforth be acquired only through training and initiation, save in the cases of \"natural and bornmagicians,\" sensitives and mediums, as they are called now.*** This expression \"petrified\" instead of \"ossified\" is curious. The \"back eye,\" which is of course the pineal gland, now so-called, the small pea-like mass of grey nervous matter attached to the back of the third ventricle of the brain, is said toalmost invariably contain mineral concretions and sand, and \"nothing more.\" (Vide Infra.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 295 OCCULT PHYSIOLOGY.The undefiled Lanoo (disciple, chela) need fear no danger; he who keeps himself not in purity (who is not chaste) willreceive no help from the 'deva eye.' \"Unfortunately not. The \"deva-eye\" exists no more for the majority of mankind. The third eye is dead, and acts no longer;but it has left behind a witness to its existence. This witness is now the PINEAL GLAND. As for the \"four-armed\" men, it isthey who become the prototypes of the four-armed Hindu gods, as shown in a preceding footnote.Such is the mystery of the human eye that, in their vain endeavours to explain and account for all the difficultiessurrounding its action, some scientists have been forced to resort to occult explanations. The development of the Humaneye gives more support to the occult anthropology than to that of the materialistic physiologists. \"The eyes in the humanembryo grow from within without\" out of the brain, instead of being part of the skin, as in the insects and cuttlefish.Professor Lankester, thinking the brain a queer place for the eye, and attempting to explain the phenomenon onDarwinian lines, suggests the curious view that \"our\" earliest vertebrate ancestor was a transparent creature and hencedid not mind where the eye was! And so was man \"a transparent creature\" once upon a time, we are taught, hence ourtheory holds good. But how does the Lankester hypothesis square with the Haeckelian view that the vertebrate eyeoriginated by changes in the epidermis? If it started inside, the theory goes into the waste-basket. This seems to beproved by embryology. Moreover, Professor Lankester's extraordinary suggestion -- or shall we say admission? -- isrendered perhaps necessary by evolutionist necessities. Occultism with its teaching as to the gradual development ofsenses \"FROM WITHIN WITHOUT,\" from astral prototypes, is far more satisfactory: The third eye retreated inwards whenits course was run -- another point in favour of Occultism.The allegorical expression of the Hindu mystics when speaking of the \"eye of Siva,\" the Tri-bochana (\"three-eyed\"), thusreceives its justification and raison d'etre -- the transference of the pineal gland (once that \"third eye\") to the forehead,being an exoteric licence. This throws also a light on the mystery -- incomprehensible to some -- of the connectionbetween abnormal, or Spiritual Seership, and the physiological purity of the Seer. The question is often asked, \"Whyshould celibacy and chastity be a sine qua non rule and condition of regular chelaship, or the development of psychic andoccult powers\" The answer is contained in the Commentary. When we learn that the \"third eye\" was once a physiologicalorgan, and that later on, owing to the gradual------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 296 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.disappearance of spirituality and increase of materiality (Spiritual nature being extinguished by the physical), it becamean atrophied organ, as little understood now by physiologists as the spleen is -- when we learn this, the connection willbecome clear. During human life the greatest impediment in the way of spiritual development, and especially to theacquirement of Yoga powers, is the activity of our physiological senses. Sexual action being closely connected, byinteraction, with the spinal cord and the grey matter of the brain, it is useless to give any longer explanation. Of course,the normal and abnormal state of the brain, and the degree of active work in the medulla oblongata, reacts powerfully onthe pineal gland, for, owing to the number of \"centres\" in that region, which controls by far the greater majority of thephysiological actions of the animal economy, and also owing to the close and intimate neighbourhood of the two, theremust be exerted a very powerful \"inductive\" action by the medulla on the pineal gland.All this is quite plain to the Occultist, but is very vague in the sight of the general reader. The latter must then be shownthe possibility of a three-eyed man in nature, in those periods when his formation was yet in a comparatively chaoticstate. Such a possibility may be inferred from anatomical and zoological knowledge, first of all; then it may rest on theassumptions of materialistic science itself.It is asserted upon the authority of Science, and upon evidence, which is not merely a fiction of theoretical speculationthis time, that many of the animals -- especially among the lower orders of the vertebrata -- have a third eye, nowatrophied, but necessarily active in its origin.* The Hatteria species, a lizard of the order Lacertilia, recently discovered inNew Zealand (a part of ancient Lemuria so called, mark well), presents this peculiarity in a most extraordinary manner;and not only the Hatteria punctata, but the chameleon, certain reptiles, and even fishes. It was thought, at first, that it wasno more than the prolongation of the brain ending with a small protuberance, called epiphysis, a little bone separatedfrom the main bone by a cartilage, and found in every animal. But it was soon found to be more than this. It offered -- asits development and anatomical structure showed -- such an analogy with that of the eye, that it was found impossible tosee in it any-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Deeply placed within the head, covered by thick skin and muscles, true eyes that cannot see are found in certainanimals,\" also, says Haeckel: \"Vertebrate . . . blind moles and field mice, blind snakes and lizards. . . .

The atrophied eye beneath the opaque skin may be found in these blind beings in every stageof reversion.\" (\"Sense Organs,\" Haeckel.) And if two eyes could become so atrophied in lower animals, why not one eye -- the pineal gland -- in man, who is but a higher animal in his physical aspect?"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 297 THE CYCLOPS, NO MYTH.thing else. There were and are paleontologists who feel convinced to this day that this \"third eye\" has functioned in itsorigin, and they are certainly right. For this is what is said of the pineal gland in Quain's Anatomy (Vol. II. ninth edit., pp.830-851. \"Thalamencephalon\" Interbrain):--\"It is from this part, constituting at first the whole and subsequently the hinder part of the anterior primary encephalicvesicle, that the optic vesicles are developed in the earliest period, and the fore part is that in connection with which thecerebral hemispheres and accompanying parts are formed. The thalamus opticus of each side is formed by a lateralthickening of the medullary wall, while the interval between, descending towards the base, constitutes the cavity of thethird ventricle with its prolongation in the infundibulum. The grey commissure afterwards stretches across the ventricularcavity. . . . . The hinder part of the roof is developed by a peculiar process, to be noticed later, into the pineal gland, whichremains united on each side by its pedicles to the thalamus, and behind these a transverse band is formed as posteriorcommissure.\"The lamina terminalis (lamina cinerea) continues to close the third ventricle in front, below it the optic commissure formsthe floor of the ventricle, and further back the infundibulum descends to be united in the sella turcica with the tissueadjoining the posterior lobe of the pituitary body.\"The two optic thalami formed from the posterior and outer part of the anterior vesicle, consist at first of a single hollowsac of nervous matter, the cavity of which communicates on each side in front with that of the commencing cerebralhemispheres, and behind with that of the middle cephalic vesicle (corpora quadrigemina). Soon, however, by increaseddeposit taking place in their interior, behind, below, and at the sides, the thalami become solid, and at the same time acleft or fissure appears between them above, and penetrates down to the internal cavity, which continues open at theback part opposite the entrance of the Sylvian aqueduct. This cleft or fissure is the third ventricle. Behind, the two thalamicontinue united by the posterior commissure, which is distinguishable about the end of the third month, and also by thepeduncles of the pineal gland. . . . .\"At an early period the optic tracts may be recognised as hollow prolongations from the outer part of the wall of thethalami while they are still vesicular. At the fourth month these tracts are distinctly formed. They subsequently areprolonged backwards into connection with the corpora quadrigemina.\"The formation of the pineal gland and pituitary body presents some of the most interesting phenomena which areconnected with the development of the Thalamencephalon.\"The above is specially interesting when it is remembered that, were it not for the development of the hinder part of thecerebral hemispheres backwards, the pineal gland would be perfectly visible on the removal of the parietal bones. It isvery interesting also to note the obvious connection to be traced between the (originally) hollow optic tracts and the eyesanteriorly, the pineal gland and its peduncles behind, and all------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 298 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of these with the optic thalami. So that the recent discoveries in connection with the third eye of Hatteria punctata have avery important bearing on the developmental history of the human senses, and on the occult assertions in the text.It is well known, (and also regarded as a fiction now, by those who have ceased to believe in the existence of an immortalprinciple in man,) that Descartes saw in the pineal gland the Seat of the Soul. Although it is joined to every part of thebody, he said, there is one special portion of it in which the Soul exercises its functions more specially than in any other.And, as neither the heart, nor yet the brain could be that \"special\" locality, he concluded that it was that little gland tied tothe brain, yet having an action independent of it, as it could easily be put into a kind of swinging motion \"by the animalSpirits* which cross the cavities of the skull in every sense.\"Unscientific as this may appear in our day of exact learning, Descartes was yet far nearer the occult truth than is anyHaeckel. For the pineal gland, as shown, is far more connected with Soul and Spirit than with the physiological senses ofman. Had the leading Scientists a glimmer of the real processes employed by the Evolutionary Impulse, and the windingcyclic course of this great law, they would know instead of conjecturing; and feel as certain of the future physicaltransformations of the human kind by the knowledge of its past forms. Then, would they see the fallacy and all theabsurdity of their modern \"blind-force\" and mechanical processes of nature; realizing, in consequence of such knowledge,that the said pineal gland, for instance, could not but be disabled for physical use at this stage of our cycle. If the odd\"eye\" in man is now atrophied, it is a proof that, as in the lower animal, it has once been active; for nature never createsthe smallest, the most insignificant form without some definite purpose and use. It was an active organ, we say, at thatstage of evolution when the spiritual element in man reigned supreme over the hardly nascent intellectual and psychicelements. And, as the cycle ran down toward that point when the physiological senses were developed by, and went paripassu with, the growth and consolidation of the physical man, the interminable and complex vicissitudes and tribulationsof zoological development, that median \"eye\" ended by atrophying along with the early spiritual and purely psychiccharacteristics in man. The eye is the mirror and also the window of the soul, says popular wisdom,** and Vox populi VoxDei.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The \"Nervous Ether\" of Dr. B.

In the animal,whose form was as ethereal (astrally) as that of man, before the bodies of both began to evolve their coats of skin, viz., toevolve from within without the thick coating of physical substance or matter with its internal physiological mechanism --the third eye was primarily, as in man, the only seeing organ. The two physical front eyes developed* later on in bothbrute and man, whose organ of physical sight was, at the commencement of the Third Race, in the same position as thatof some of the blind vertebrata, in our day, i.e., beneath an opaque skin.** Only the stages of the odd, or primeval eye, inman and brute, are now inverted, as the former has already passed that animal non-rational stage in the Third Round,and is ahead of mere brute creation by a whole plane of consciousness. Therefore, while the \"Cyclopean\" eye was, andstill is, in man the organ of spiritual sight, in the animal it was that of objective vision. And this eye, having performed itsfunction, was replaced, in the course of physical evolution from the simple to the complex, by two eyes, and thus wasstored and laid aside by nature for further use in AEons to come.This explains why the pineal gland reached its highest development proportionately with the lowest physicaldevelopment. It is the vertebrata in which it is the most prominent and objective, and in man it is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] and ethereal without; the second, psycho-spiritual mentally, and ethero-physical bodily; the third, still bereft of intellect in its beginning, is astro-physical in its body, and lives an inner life, inwhich the psycho-spiritual element is in no way interfered with as yet by the hardly nascent physiological senses. Its twofront eyes look before them without seeing either past or future. But the \"third eye\" \"embraces ETERNITY.\"* But in a very different manner to that pictured by Haeckel as an \"evolution by natural selection in the struggle forexistence\" (\"Pedigree of Man.\" \"Sense Organs,\" p. 335). The mere \"thermal sensibility of the skin,\" to hypothetical light-waves, is absurdly incompetent to account for the beautiful combination of adaptations present in the eye. It has,moreover, been previously shown that \"natural Selection\" is a pure myth when credited with the origination of variations(vide infra, Part III., on Darwinian mechanical causation); as the \"survival of the fittest\" can only take place after usefulvariations have sprung up, together with improved organisms. Whence came the \"useful variations,\" which developed theeye? Only from \"blind forces . . . without aim, without design?\" The argument is puerile. The true solution of the mystery isto be found in the impersonal Divine Wisdom, in its IDEATION -- reflected through matter.** Palaeontology has ascertained that in the animals of the Cenozoic age -- the Saurians especially, such as theantediluvian Labyrinthodon, whose fossil skull exhibits a perforation otherwise inexplicable -- the third, or odd eye musthave been much developed. Several naturalists, among others E. Korscheldt, feel convinced that whereas,notwithstanding the opaque skin covering it, such an eye in the reptiles of the present period can only distinguish lightfrom darkness (as the human eyes do when bound with a handkerchief, or even tightly closed), in the now extinct animalsthat eye functioned and was a real organ of vision.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 300 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.most carefully hidden and inaccessible, except to the anatomist. No less light is thrown thereby on the future physical,spiritual, and intellectual state of mankind, in periods corresponding on parallel lines with other past periods, and alwayson the lines of ascending and descending cyclic evolution and development. Thus, a few centuries before the Kali yuga --the black age which began nearly 5,000 years ago -- it was said (paraphrased into comprehensible sentences):\"We (the Fifth Root-Race) in our first half (of duration) onward (on the now ASCENDING arc of the cycle) are on the midpoint of (or between) the First and the Second Races -- falling downward (i.e., the races were then on the descending arcof the cycle). . . . . Calculate for thyself, Lanoo, and see.\" (Commentary xx.).Calculating as advised, we find that during that transitional period -- namely, in the second half of the First Spiritualethero-astral race -- nascent mankind was devoid of the intellectual brain element. As it was on its descending line, andas we are parallel to it, on the ascending, we are,EVOLUTION OF ROOT RACES IN THE FOURTH ROUND[[diagram]]DOWNWARD CYCLE.Evolution of physical and intellectual nature and the gradual regression of Spirituality.1st R.

For, remember well, as we are in themanasa period of our cycle of races, or in the Fifth, we have, therefore, crossed the meridian point of the perfectadjustment of Spirit and Matter -- or that equilibrium between brain intellect and Spiritual perception. One important pointhas, however, to be borne in mind.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 301 THE ODD EYE IS NOW A GLAND.We are only in the Fourth Round, and it is in the Fifth that the full development of Manas, as a direct ray from theUniversal MAHAT -- a ray unimpeded by matter -- will be finally reached. Nevertheless, as every sub-race and nationhave their cycles and stages of developmental evolution repeated on a smaller scale, it must be the more so in the caseof a Root-Race. Our race then has, as a Root-race, crossed the equatorial line and is cycling onward on the Spiritual side;but some of our sub-races still find themselves on the shadowy descending arc of their respective national cycles; whileothers again -- the oldest -- having crossed their crucial point, which alone decides whether a race, a nation, or a tribe willlive or perish, are at the apex of spiritual development as sub-races.It becomes comprehensible now why the \"odd eye\" has been gradually transformed into a simple gland, after the physicalFall of those we have agreed to call the \"Lemurians.\"It is a curious fact that it is especially in human beings that the cerebral hemispheres and the lateral ventricles have beendeveloped, and that the optic thalami, corpora quadrigemina, and corpora striata are the principal parts which aredeveloped in the mammalian brain. Moreover it is asserted that the intellect of any man may to some extent be gaugedby the development of the central convolutions and the fore part of the cerebral hemispheres. It would seem a naturalcorollary that if the development and increased size of the pineal gland may be considered to be an index of the astralcapacities and spiritual proclivities of any man, there will be a corresponding development of that part of the cranium, oran increase in the size of the pineal gland at the expense of the hinder part of the cerebral hemispheres. It is a curiousspeculation which would receive a confirmation in this case. We should see, below and behind, the cerebellum which hasbeen held to be the seat of all the animal proclivities of a human being, and which is allowed by science to be the greatcentre for all the physiologically co-ordinated movements of the body, such as walking, eating, etc., etc.; in front, the fore-part of the brain -- the cerebral hemispheres -- the part especially connected with the development of the intellectualpowers in man; and in the middle, dominating them both, and especially the animal functions, the developed pineal gland,in connection with the more highly evolved, or spiritual man.It must be remembered that these are only physical correspondences; just as the ordinary human brain is the registeringorgan of memory, but not memory itself.This is, then, the organ which gave rise to so many legends and traditions, among others to that of man with one headbut two faces. These may be found in several Chinese works, besides being referred to in the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 302 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Chaldean fragments. Apart from the work already cited -- the Shan Hai King, compiled by King Chia from engravings onnine urns made 2,255 B.C., by the Emperor Yu, they may be found in another work, called the \"Bamboo Books,\" and in athird one, the \"Rh Ya\" -- \"initiated according to tradition by Chow Kung, uncle of Wu Wang, the first Emperor of the ChowDynasty, B.C., 1,122\":-- says Mr. Ch. Gould in his \"Mythical Monsters.\" The Bamboo Books contain the ancient annals ofChina, found A.D. 279 at the opening of the grave of King Seang of Wai, who died B.C. 295. Both these works mentionmen with two faces on one head -- one in front and one behind (p. 27).Now that which the students of Occultism ought to know is that THE \"THIRD EYE\" IS INDISSOLUBLY CONNECTEDWITH KARMA. The tenet is so mysterious that very few have heard of it.The \"eye of Siva\" did not become entirely atrophied before the close of the Fourth Race. When spirituality and all thedivine powers and attributes of the deva-man of the Third had been made the hand-maidens of the newly-awakenedphysiological and psychic passions of the physical man, instead of the reverse, the eye lost its powers. But such was thelaw of Evolution, and it was, in strict accuracy, no FALL. The sin was not in using those newly-developed powers, but inmisusing them; in making of the tabernacle, designed to contain a god, the fane of every spiritual iniquity. And if we say\"sin\" it is merely that everyone should understand our meaning; as the term Karma* would be the right one to use in thiscase; while the reader who would feel perplexed at the use of the term \"spiritual\" instead of \"physical\" iniquity, isreminded of the fact that there can be no physical iniquity. The body is simply the irresponsible organ, the tool of thepsychic, if not of the \"Spiritual man.\" While in the case of the Atlanteans, it was precisely the Spiritual being which sinned,the Spirit element being still the \"Master\" principle in man, in those days. Thus it is in those days that the heaviest Karmaof the Fifth Race was generated by our Monads.As this sentence may again be found puzzling, it is better that it should be explained for the benefit of those who areignorant of the theosophical teachings.Questions with regard to Karma and re-births are constantly offered, and a great confusion seems to exist upon thissubject. Those who are born and bred in the Christian faith, and have been trained in the idea[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Karma is a word of many meanings, and has a special term for almost every one of its aspects. It means, as a synonymof sin, the performance of some action for the attainment of an object of worldly, hence selfish, desire, which cannot fail to"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"be hurtful to somebody else. Karman is action, the Cause; and Karma again is \"the law of ethical causation\"; the effect ofan act produced egotistically, when the great law of harmony depends on altruism.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 303 THE NUMBER OF MONADS IS LIMITED.that a new soul is created by God for every newly-born infant, are among the most perplexed. They ask whether in suchcase the number of incarnating Monads on earth is limited; to which they are answered in the affirmative. For, howevercountless, in our conceptions, the number of the incarnating monads -- even if we take into account the fact that eversince the Second Race, when their respective seven groups were furnished with bodies, several births and deaths maybe allowed for every second of time in the aeons already passed -- still, there must be a limit. It was stated that Karma-Nemesis, whose bond-maid is Nature, adjusted everything in the most harmonious manner; and that, therefore, the freshpouring-in, or arrival of new Monads, had ceased as soon as Humanity had reached its full physical development. Nofresh Monads have incarnated since the middle-point of the Atlanteans. Hence, remembering that, save in the case ofyoung children, and of individuals whose lives were violently cut off by some accident, no Spiritual Entity can re-incarnatebefore a period of many centuries has elapsed, such gaps alone must show that the number of Monads is necessarilyfinite and limited. Moreover, a reasonable time must be given to other animals for their evolutionary progress.Hence the assertion that many of us are now working off the effects of the evil Karmic causes produced by us inAtlantean bodies. The Law of KARMA is inextricably interwoven with that of Re-incarnation.It is only the knowledge of the constant re-births of one and the same individuality throughout the life-cycle; the assurancethat the same MONADS -- among whom are many Dhyan-Chohans, or the \"Gods\" themselves -- have to pass throughthe \"Circle of Necessity,\" rewarded or punished by such rebirth for the suffering endured or crimes committed in theformer life; that those very Monads, which entered the empty, senseless shells, or astral figures of the First Raceemanated by the Pitris, are the same who are now amongst us -- nay, ourselves, perchance; it is only this doctrine, wesay, that can explain to us the mysterious problem of Good and Evil, and reconcile man to the terrible and apparentinjustice of life. Nothing but such certainty can quiet our revolted sense of justice. For, when one unacquainted with thenoble doctrine looks around him, and observes the inequalities of birth and fortune, of intellect and capacities; when onesees honour paid fools and profligates, on whom fortune has heaped her favours by mere privilege of birth, and theirnearest neighbour, with all his intellect and noble virtues ---far more deserving in every way --perishing of want and forlack of sympathy; when one sees all this and has to turn away, helpless to relieve the undeserved suffering, one's earsringing and heart aching with the cries of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 304 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.pain around him -- that blessed knowledge of Karma alone prevents him from cursing life and men, as well as theirsupposed Creator.*Of all the terrible blasphemies and accusations virtually thrown on their God by the Monotheists, none is greater or moreunpardonable than that (almost always) false humility which makes the presumably \"pious\" Christian assert, in connectionwith every evil and undeserved blow, that \"such is the will of God.\"Dolts and hypocrites! Blasphemers and impious Pharisees, who speak in the same breath of the endless merciful loveand care of their God and creator for helpless man, and of that God scourging the good, the very best of his creatures,bleeding them to death like an insatiable Moloch! Shall we be answered to this, in Congreve's words:--\"But who shall dare to tax Eternal Justice?\" Logic and simple common sense, we answer: if we are made to believe in the\"original Sin,\" in one life, on this Earth only, for every Soul, and in an anthropomorphic Deity, who seems to have createdsome men only for the pleasure of condemning them to eternal hell-fire (and this whether they are good or bad, says thePredestinarian),** why should not every man endowed with reasoning powers condemn in his turn such a villainousDeity? Life would become unbearable, if one had to believe in the God created by man's unclean fancy. Luckily he existsonly in human dogmas, and in the unhealthy imagination of some poets, who believe they have solved the problem byaddressing him as --\"Thou great Mysterious Power, who hast involvedThe pride of human wisdom, to confoundThe daring scrutiny and prove the faithOf thy presuming creatures! . . . .\"Truly a robust \"faith\" is required to believe that it is \"presumption\" to question the justice of one, who creates helpless littleman but to \"perplex\" him, and to test a \"faith\" with which that \"Power,\" moreover, may have forgotten, if not neglected, toendow him, as happens sometimes.Compare this blind faith with the philosophical belief, based on every reasonable evidence and life-experience, in Karma-Nemesis, or the Law of Retribution.

It exists from and in Eternity, truly, for it is ETERNITY itself; and as such, sinceno act can be co-equal with eternity, it cannot be said to act, for it is ACTION itself. It is not the Wave which drowns aman, but the personal action of the wretch, who goes deliberately and places himself under the impersonal action of thelaws that govern the Ocean's motion. Karma creates nothing, nor does it design. It is man who plans and creates causes,and Karmic law adjusts the effects; which adjustment is not an act, but universal harmony, tending ever to resume itsoriginal position, like a bough, which, bent down too forcibly, rebounds with corresponding vigour. If it happen to dislocatethe arm that tried to bend it out of its natural position, shall we say that it is the bough which broke our arm, or that ourown folly has brought us to grief? Karma has never sought to destroy intellectual and individual liberty, like the Godinvented by the Monotheists. It has not involved its decrees in darkness purposely to perplex man; nor shall it punish himwho dares to scrutinise its mysteries. On the contrary, he who unveils through study and meditation its intricate paths,and throws light on those dark ways, in the windings of which so many men perish owing to their ignorance of thelabyrinth of life, is working for the good of his fellow-men. KARMA is an Absolute and Eternal law in the World ofmanifestation; and as there can only be one Absolute, as One eternal ever present Cause, believers in Karma cannot beregarded as Atheists or materialists -- still less as fatalists:\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Some theosophists, in order to make Karma more comprehensible to the Western mind, as being better acquainted withthe Greek than with Aryan philosophy, have made an attempt to translate it by Nemesis. Had the latter been known to theprofane in antiquity, as it was understood by the Initiate, this translation of the term would be unobjectionable. As it is, ithas been too much anthropomorphised by Greek fancy to permit our using it without an elaborate explanation. With theearly Greeks, \"from Homer to Herodotus, she was no goddess, but a moral feeling rather,\" says Decharme; the barrier toevil and immorality. He who transgresses it, commits a sacrilege in the eyes of the gods, and is pursued by Nemesis. But,with time, that \"feeling\" was deified, and its personification became an ever-fatal and punishing goddess. Therefore, if wewould connect Karma with Nemesis, it has to be done in the triple character of the latter, viz., as Nemesis, Adrasteia andThemis. For, while the latter is the goddess of Universal Order and Harmony, who, like Nemesis, is commissioned torepress every excess, and keep man within the limits of Nature and righteousness under severe penalty, Adrasteia -- \"theinevitable\" -- represents Nemesis as the immutable effect of causes created by man himself. Nemesis, as the daughter ofDike, is the equitable goddess reserving her wrath for those alone who are maddened with pride, egoism, and impiety.(See Mesomed. Hymn. Nemes., V. 2. Brunck, Analecta II. p. 292; Mythol. de la Grece Antique, p. 304.) In short, whileNemesis is a mythological, exoteric goddess, or Power, personified and anthropomorphised in its various aspects, Karmais a highly philosophical truth, a most divine noble expression of the primitive intuition of man concerning Deity. It is adoctrine which explains the origin of Evil, and [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------ [[Vol. 2, Page]] 306 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.for Karma is one with the Unknowable, of which it is an aspect in its effects in the phenomenal world.Intimately, or rather indissolubly, connected with Karma, then, is the law of re-birth, or of the re-incarnation of the samespiritual individuality in a long, almost interminable, series of personalities. The latter are like the various costumes andcharacters played by the same actor, with each of which that actor identifies himself and is identified by the public, for thespace of a few hours. The inner, or real man, who personates those characters, knows the whole time that he is Hamletfor the brief space of a few acts, which represent, however, on the plane of human illusion the whole life of Hamlet. Andhe knows that he was, the night before, King Lear, the transformation in his turn of the Othello of a still earlier precedingnight; but the outer, visible character is supposed to be ignorant of the fact. In actual life that ignorance is, unfortunately,but too real. Nevertheless, the permanent individuality is fully aware of the fact, though, through the atrophy of the\"spiritual\" eye in the physical body, that knowledge is unable to impress itself on the consciousness of the falsepersonality.The possession of a physical third eye, we are told, was enjoyed by the men of the Third Root-Race down to nearly themiddle period of Third SUB-race of the Fourth Root-Race, when the consolidation and perfection of the human framemade it disappear from the outward anatomy of man. Psychically and spiritually, however, its mental and visualperceptions lasted till nearly the end of the Fourth Race, when its functions, owing to the materiality and depravedcondition of mankind, died out altogether before the submersion of the bulk of the Atlantean continent. And now we mayreturn to the Deluges and their many \"Noahs.\"The student has to bear in mind that there were many such deluges as that mentioned in Genesis, and three far moreimportant ones, which will be mentioned and described in the Section devoted to the subject of pre-historic continents. Toavoid erroneous conjectures, however, with regard to the claim that the esoteric doctrine has much in it of the legendscontained in the Hindu Scriptures; that, again, the chronology of the latter is almost that of the former -- only explainedand made clear; and that finally the belief that \"Vaivasvata Manu\" -- a generic name indeed! -- was the Noah of theAryans and his prototype, all this, which is also the belief of the Occultists, necessitates at this juncture a newexplanation.

But there is no discrepancy in truth. The reader is asked to turn to theTheosophist of July, 1883, and after studying the article therein, \"The Septenary Principle in Esotericism,\" the wholequestion can be explained to him. It is in this explanation, I believe, that the Occultists differ from the Brahmins.For the benefit of those, however, who may not have \"The Theosophist\" of that month and year to hand, a passage or twomay now be quoted from it:\"Who was Manu, the son of Swayambhuva?

Those who know that there are seven rounds, of which we have passed three, and are now in the fourth;and who are[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Pralaya -- a word already explained -- is not a term that applies only to every \"Night of Brahma,\" or the world'sdissolution following every Manvantara, equal to 71 Maha-yugas. It applies also to each \"obscuration\" as well, and evento every Cataclysm that puts an end, by Fire or by Water in turn, to each Root-Race. Pralaya is a term like that of \"Manu\"-- the generic name for the Sishtas, who, under the appellation of \"King,\" are shown in the Puranas as preserved \"with theseed of all things in an ark from the waters of that flood\" (or the fires of a general volcanic conflagration, thecommencement of which we already see for our Fifth-Race in the terrible earthquakes and eruptions of these late years,and especially in the present one) . . . . which in the season of a pralaya overspreads the world\" (the Earth). (SeePreface, p. lxxxi., to Wilson's \"Vishnu Purana.\") Time is only a form of \"Vishnu\" -- truly, as Parasara says in that Purana.In the Hindu Yuga Kalpa, we have the regular descending series 4, 3, 2, with ciphers multiplied as occasion requires foresoteric purposes, but not, as Wilson and other Orientalists thought, for \"sectarian embellishments.\" A Kalpa may be anage, a \"Day\" of Brahma, or a sidereal Kalpa, astronomical and earthly. Those calculations are found in all the Puranas,but some differ -- as for instance, \"the year of the seven Rishis, 3,030 mortal years, and the year of Dhruva, 9,090 in theLinga Purana,\" which are again esoteric, and which do represent actual (secret) chronology. As said in the BrahmaVaivarta: \"Chronologers compute a Kalpa by the life of Brahma. Minor Kalpas, as Samvarta and the rest, are numerous.\"\"Minor Kalpas\" denote here every period of destruction, as was well understood by Wilson himself, who explains the latteras \"those in which the Samvarta wind or other destructive agents operate\" (Vishnu Purana, p. 54, vol.

We are told in the Sacred Hindu scriptures that the first Manu produced six other Manus (seven primary Manusin all), and these produced in their turn each seven other Manus** (Bhrigu I, 61-63) -- the production of the latter standingin the occult treatises as 7 x 7. Thus it becomes clear that Manu -- the last one, the progenitor of our Fourth RoundHumanity -- must be the seventh, since we are on our fourth Round,*** and there is a root-Manu at globe A and a seedManu at globe G. Just as each planetary Round commences with the appearance of a 'Root Manu' (Dhyan Chohan) andcloses with a 'Seed-Manu,' so a Root and a Seed Manu appear respectively at the beginning and the termination of thehuman period on any particular planet.**** It will be easily seen from the foregoing statement that a Manu-antaric periodmeans, as the term implies, the time between the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* An intuition and a presentiment of the Sishtas may be found in Mr. Sinnett's \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" Fifth Edition. See in itAnnotations -- the \"Noah's Ark Theory\" pp. 146, 147.** The fact that Manu himself is made to declare that he was created by Viraj, and that he then produced the tenPrajapatis, who again produced seven Manus, who in their turn gave birth to seven other Manus (Manu, I, 33-36) relatesto other still earlier mysteries, and is at the same time a blind with regard to the doctrine of the Septenary chain, and thesimultaneous evolution of seven humanities, or MEN. However, the present work is written on the records of Cis-Himalayan Secret Teachings, and Brahmanical esoteric philosophy may now differ in form as the Kabala does. But theywere identical in hoary antiquity.*** There is another esoteric reason besides this one for it. A Vaivasvata is the seventh Manu, because this our Round,although the Fourth, is in the preseptenary Manvantara, and the Round itself is in its seventh stage of materiality orphysicality. The close of its middle racial point occurred during the Fourth Root Race, when man and all nature reachedtheir lowest state of gross matter. From that time, i.e., from the end of the three and a half races, humanity and natureentered on the ascending arc of their racial cycle.**** The interval that precedes each Yuga is called a Sandhya, composed of as many hundreds of years as there arethousands in the yuga; and that which follows the latter is named Sandhyamsa, and is of similar duration, we are told inVishnu Purana. \"The interval between the Sandhya and the Sandhyamsa is the yuga denominated Krita, Treta, etc., etc.The (four) Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali constitute a great age, or aggregate of four ages: a 1000 such aggregates area Day of Brahma; and 14 Manus reign within that term.\" Now had we to accept this literally then there would be only oneManu for every 4,320,000,000 of years.

Moreover, that, asit is said that each of the seven Manus creates 7 x 7 Manus, and that there are 49 root-races on the seven planets duringeach Round, then every root-race has its Manu. The present seventh Manu is called 'Vaivasvata' and stands in theexoteric texts for that Manu who represents in India the Babylonian Xisuthrus and the Jewish Noah. But in the esotericbooks we are told that Manu Vaivasvata, the progenitor of our Fifth race -- who saved it from the flood that nearlyexterminated the Fourth (Atlantis) -- is not the seventh Manu, mentioned in the nomenclature of the Root, or primitive-Manus, but one of the 49 Manus emanated from this Root-Manu.\"For clearer comprehension we here give the names of the 14 Manus in their respective order and relation to eachRound:--1st Round1st (Root) Manu on Planet A -- Swayambhuva.1st (Seed) Manu on Planet G -- Swarochi (or) Swarotisha.2nd Round2nd (R) M. on Planet A -- Uttama.2nd (S) M. \" G -- Thamasa.3rd Round3rd (R) M. \" A -- Raivata.3rd (S) M. \" G -- Chackchuska.4th Round4th (R) M. \" A -- Vaivasvata (our progenitor)4th (S) M. \" G -- Savarna5th Round5th (R) M. \" A -- Daksha Savarna.5th (S) M. \" G -- Brahma Savarna.6th Round6th (R) M. \" A -- Dharma Savarna.6th (S) M. \" G -- Rudra Savarna.7th Round7th (R) M. \" A -- Rouchya.7th (S) M. \" G -- Bhoutya.\"Vaivasvata, thus, though seventh in the order given, is the primitive Root-Manu of our fourth Human Wave (the readermust always remember that Manu is not a man but collective humanity), while our Vaivasvata was but one of the sevenMinor Manus, who are made to preside over the seven races of this our planet. Each of these has to become the witnessof one of the periodical and ever-recurring cataclysms (by fire and water) that close the cycle of every Root-race. And it isthis Vaivasvata -- the Hindu ideal embodiment, called respectively Xisuthrus, Deukalion, Noah and by other names -- whois the allegorical man who rescued our race, when nearly the whole population of one hemisphere perished by water,while the other hemisphere was awakening from its temporary obscuration.\"*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The words \"creation,\" \"dissolution,\" etc., do not render correctly the right meaning of either Manvantara or Pralaya. TheVishnu Purana enumerates several: The dissolution of all things is of four kinds, Parasara is made to say:-- Naimittika(occasional), when Brahma slumbers (his night, when, \"At the end of this day occurs a re-coalescence of the Universe,called Brahma's contingent re-coalescence,\" because Brahma is this universe itself); \"Prakritika (elemental), when thereturn of this universe to its original nature is partial and physical; Atyantika (absolute), identification of the embodied withthe incorporeal Supreme spirit -- Mahatmic state, whether temporary or until the following Maha Kalpa: also absoluteobscuration -- as of a whole [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 310 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Thus it is shown that there is no real discrepancy in speaking of the Vaivasvata Manvantara (Manu-antara, lit. \"betweentwo Manus\") 18,000,000 odd years ago, when physical, or the truly human man first appeared in his Fourth Round on thisearth; and of the other Vaivasvatas, e.g., the Manu of the Great Cosmic or sidereal Flood (a mystery), or again the ManuVaivasvata of the submerged Atlantis, when the racial Vaivasvata saved the elect of Humanity, the Fifth Race, from utterdestruction. As the several (and quite different) events are purposely blended in the Vishnu and other Puranas in onenarrative, there may yet be a great deal of perplexity left in the profane reader's mind. Therefore, as constant elucidationis needed, we must be forgiven unavoidable repetitions. The blinds which conceal the real mysteries of Esotericphilosophy are great and puzzling, and even now the last word cannot be given.

It is from IT that issues the great unseen Logos, whoevolves all the other logoi, the primeval MANU who gives being to the other Manus, who emanate the universe and all init collectively, and who represent in their aggregate the manifested Logos.* Hence we learn in the \"Commentaries\" thatwhile no Dhyan Chohan, not even the highest, can realise completely \"the condition of the preceding Cosmic evolution,\"\"the Manus retain a knowledge of their experiences of all the Cosmic evolutions throughout Eternity.\" This is very plain:the first Manu is called Swayambhuva,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] planetary chain, etc.; and Nitya (perpetual) Mahapralaya for the Universe,death -- for man, nitya is the extinction of life, like the extinction of a lamp,\" also \"in sleep at night.\" Nitya Sarga is\"constant or perpetual creation,\" as Nitya pralaya is \"constant or perpetual destruction of all that is born.\" \"That whichensues after a minor dissolution is called ephemeral creation. . . .

The subject is so difficult that we are obliged to repeat our statements.* But see the superb definitions of Parabrahmam and the Logos in Mr. Subba Row's Lectures on the Bhagavat Gita in theearly numbers of the Theosophist of 1887, Feb., March, April, and May.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 311 THE FOUR EARLIER RACES.\"the Self-manifested,\" the Son of the unmanifested FATHER. The Manus are the creators of the creators of our FirstRace -- the Spirit of mankind -- which does not prevent the seven Manus from having been the first \"pre-Adamic\" men onEarth.Manu declares himself created by Viraj,* or Vaiswanara, (the Spirit of Humanity),** which means that his Monademanates from the never resting Principle in the beginning of every new Cosmic activity: that Logos or UNIVERSALMONAD (collective Elohim) that radiates from within himself all those Cosmic Monads that become the centres of activity-- progenitors of the numberless Solar systems as well as of the yet undifferentiated human monads of planetary chainsas well as of every being thereon. Each Cosmic Monad is \"Swayambhuva,\" the SELF-BORN, which becomes the Centreof Force, from within which emerges a planetary chain (of which chains there are seven in our system), and whoseradiations become again so many Manus Swayambhuva (a generic name, mysterious and meaning far more thanappears), each of these becoming, as a Host, the Creator of his own Humanity. (See \"The Manus and the ManvantarasExplained by a Western Mystic and Mathematician.\")As to the question of the four distinct races of mankind that preceded our Fifth Race, there is nothing mystical in it, exceptthe ethereal bodies of the first races; and it is a matter of legendary, nevertheless, very correct history. That legend isuniversal. And if the Western savant pleases to see in it only a myth, it does not make the slightest difference. TheMexicans had, and still have, the tradition of the fourfold destruction of the world by fire and water, just as the Egyptianshad, and the Hindus have, to this day.Trying to account for the community of legends in the remote antiquity -- held by Chinese, Chaldean, Egyptians, Indiansand Greeks -- and for the absence of any certain vestige of civilization more ancient than 5,000 years, the author of\"Mythical Monsters,\" remarks, that \"we must not be surprised if we do not immediately discover the vestiges of the peopleof ten, fifteen, or twenty thousand years ago.

It is this \"destruction\" which is called allegorically thegreat \"Vaivasvata Manu Deluge,\" when the account shows Vaivasvata Manu (or \"Humanity\") remaining alone on Earth inthe Ark of Salvation towed by Vishnu in the shape of a monstrous fish, and the Seven Rishis \"with him.\" The allegory isvery plain:--In the Symbolism of every nation, the \"Deluge\" stands for Chaotic unsettled matter -- Chaos itself: and the Water for thefeminine principle -- the \"Great Deep.\" As the Greek Lexicon of Parkhurst gives it -- \"Arche (ark) answers to the Hebrewrasit, or Wisdom . . . . and (at the same time) to the emblem of the female generative power, the Arg or Arca, in which thegerm of nature (and of mankind) floats or broods on the great Abyss of the waters, during the interval which takes placeafter every mundane (or racial) cycle.\" Ark is also the mystic name of the divine spirit of life which broods over chaos.Now Vishnu is the divine Spirit, as an abstract principle, and also as the Preserver and Generator, or Giver of life -- thethird person of the Trimurti (composed of Brahma, the Creator, Siva, the Destroyer, and Vishnu, the Preserver). Vishnu isshown in the allegory as guiding, under the form of a fish, the Ark of Vaivasvata Manu clean across the waters of theFlood. There is no use in expatiating upon the esoteric meaning of the word fish. (See Payne Knight, Inman, GeraldMassey, etc.) Its theological meanings is phallic, but the metaphysical, divine. Jesus is called the \"Fish,\" and so wereVishnu and Bacchus: [[Ies]], the \"Saviour\" of mankind, being but the monogram of the god Bacchus called [[Ichthus]], thefish.* As to the Seven Rishis in the Ark, they symbolised the seven principles, which became complete in man only afterhe had separated, and become a human, and no longer a divine creature. (See for further details, \"The Seventh Manu.\")Nor have we many details about the submersion of the continent inhabited by the Second Root Race. But the history ofthe Third, \"Lemuria,\" is given, as is that of Atlantis, the others being only alluded to. Lemuria is said to have perishedabout 700,000 years before the commencement of what is now called the Tertiary age (the Eocene),** and it is during thisDeluge also -- an actual geological deluge this time -- that Vaivasvata Manu is again shown as saving mankind(allegorically it is mankind, or a portion of it, the Fourth Race, which is saved); so also he saves the Fifth Race during thedestruction of the last Atlanteans, the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Says St. Augustin of Jesus, \"For he is a fish that lives in the midst of waters.\" Christians called themselves little fishes --pisciculi -- in their sacred mysteries. \"So many fishes bred in the water, and saved by one great fish,\" says Tertullian ofthe Christians and Christ and the Church.** \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" p. 55.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 314 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.remnants that perished 850,000 years ago,* after which there was no great submersion until the day of Plato's Atlantis, orPoseidonis, known to the Egyptians only because it happened in such relatively recent times.It is the submersion of the great Atlantis which is the most interesting. It is of this cataclysm that the old records (See the\"Book of Enoch\") say that \"the ends of the Earth got loose;\" and upon which the legends and allegories of Vaivasvata,Xisuthrus, Noah, Deukalion and all the tutti quanti of the Elect saved, have been built. Tradition, taking into no accountthe difference between sidereal and geological phenomena, calls both indifferently \"deluges.\" Yet there is a greatdifference. The cataclysm which destroyed the huge continent of which Australia is the largest relic, was due to a seriesof subterranean convulsions and the breaking asunder of the ocean floors. That which put an end to its successor -- thefourth continent -- was brought on by successive disturbances in the axial rotation. It began during the earliest tertiaryperiods, and, continuing for long ages, carried away successively the last vestige of Atlantis, with the exception, perhaps,of Ceylon and a small portion of what is now Africa.

If Dr. Croll willhave it that all such alterations can be accounted for by the effects of nutation and the precession of the equinoxes, thereare other men of Science, such as Sir H. James (Athenaeum, Aug. 25, 1860), and Sir John Lubbock (ibid), who feel moreinclined to accept the idea that they are due to a change in the position of the axis of rotation. Against this the majority ofthe astronomers are again arrayed. But then, what have they not denied before now, and what have they not denounced-- only to accept it later on whenever the hypothesis became undeniable fact?How far our figures agree, or rather disagree with modern Science will be seen further in the Addenda to this Book, wherethe geology and anthropology of our modern day are carefully compared with the same in Archaic Science.

With regard to the pre-human period, all that can be said, at present, is, that even up to theappearance of the \"Mindless\" First Race, the Earth was not without its inhabitants. More may be said: that which Science-- recognizing only physical man -- has a right to regard as the prehuman period, may be conceded to have extendedfrom the First Race down to the first half of the Atlantean race, since it is only then that man became the \"completeorganic being he is now.\" And this would make Adamic man no older than a few million of years.*The author of the Qabbalah remarks truly that \"Man to-day, as an individual, is only a concatenation of the being-hood ofprecedent human life,\" or lives, rather. \"According to the Qabbalah, the soul sparks contained in Adam (Rishoun), wentinto three principal classes corresponding to his three sons, viz.: Hesed, Habel, Ge-boor-ah, Qai-yin and Ra'hmin Seth.These three were divided into 70 species, called: the principal roots of the human race.\" (p. 422.)\"Said Rabbi Jehudah: 'How many garments (of the incorporeal man) are these which are crowned' (from the day manwas 'created')?

Yet \"they are authorities\" -- we are sternly reminded. What of that?The Pope of Rome is also an AUTHORITY and an infallible one -- for his followers; whereas the remarkable fallibility ofScientific speculations is being proven periodically with every change of the moon.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 317 PRESENTMENTS OF TRUTHS.ay, men and civilized nations, not Palaeolithic savages only; who, under the guidance of their divine Rulers, built largecities, cultivated arts and sciences, and knew astronomy, architecture and mathematics to perfection. This primevalcivilization did not, as one may think, immediately follow their physiological transformation. Between the final evolutionand the first city built, many hundred thousands of years had passed. Yet, we find the Lemurians in their sixth sub-racebuilding their first rock-cities out of stone and lava.* One of such great cities of primitive structure was built entirely of lava,some thirty miles west from where Easter Island now stretches its narrow piece of sterile ground, and was entirelydestroyed by a series of volcanic eruptions. The oldest remains of Cyclopean buildings were all the handiwork of theLemurians of the last sub-races; and an occultist shows, therefore, no wonder on learning that the stone relics found onthe small piece of land called Easter Island by Captain Cook, are \"very much like the walls of the Temple of Pachacamacor the Ruins of Tia-Huanuco in Peru,\" (\"The Countries of the World,\" by Robert Brown, Vol. 4, p. 43); and that they are inthe CYCLOPEAN STYLE. The first large cities, however, appeared on that region of the continent which is now known asthe island of Madagascar. There were civilized people and savages in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Our best modern novelists, who are neither Theosophists nor Spiritualists, begin to have, nevertheless, verypsychological and suggestively Occult dreams: witness Mr. Louis Stephenson and his Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, thanwhich no grander psychological essay on Occult lines exists. Has the rising novelist, Mr. Rider Haggard, also had aprophetic or rather a retrospective clairvoyant dream before he wrote \"SHE\"? His imperial Kor, the great city of the dead,whose surviving living men sailed northwards after the plague had killed almost a whole nation, seems to step out in itsgeneral outlines from the imperishable pages of the old archaic records. Ayesha suggests \"that those men who sailednorth may have been the fathers of the first Egyptians\"; and then seems to attempt a synopsis of certain letters of aMASTER quoted in \"Esoteric Buddhism.\" For, she says, \"Time after time have nations, ay, and rich and strong nations,learned in the arts, been, and passed away, and been forgotten, so that no memory of them remains. This (the nation ofKor) is but one of several; for time eats up the work of man unless, indeed, he digs in caves like the people of Kor, andthen mayhap the sea swallows them, or the earthquake shakes them in. . . . . Yet were not these people utterlydestroyed, as I think. Some few remained in the other cities, for their cities were many. But the barbarians . . . came downupon them, and took their women to wife, and the race of the Amahagger that is now is a bastard brood of the mightysons of Kor, and behold it dwelleth in the tombs with its fathers' bones. . .\" (pp. 180, 181.)Here the clever novelist seems to repeat the history of all the now degraded and down-fallen races of humanity. TheGeologists and Anthropologists would place at the head of humanity as descendants of Homo primigenius, the ape-man,of which \"NO FOSSIL REMAINS ARE AS YET KNOWN TO US,\" but (which) \"were PROBABLY akin to the gorilla andorang of the present day\" (Haeckel). In answer to whose \"probably,\" occultists point to another and a greater probability --the one given in our text.

Evolution achieved its work of perfection with the former, and Karma -- its work ofdestruction on the latter. The Australians and their like are the descendants of those, who, instead of vivifying the sparkdropped into them by the \"Flames,\" extinguished it by long generations of bestiality.* The Aryan nations could trace theirdescent through the Atlanteans from the more spiritual races of the Lemurians, in whom the \"Sons of Wisdom\" hadpersonally incarnated.**It is with the advent of the divine Dynasties that the first civilizations were started. And while, in some regions of the Earth,a portion of mankind preferred leading a nomadic and patriarchal life, and in others savage man was hardly learning tobuild a fire and to protect himself against the Elements, his brothers -- more favoured than he by their Karma, and helpedby the divine intelligence which informed them -- built cities, and cultivated arts and sciences. Nevertheless, andcivilization notwithstand-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Stanza II, ante. This would account for the great difference and variation between the intellectual capacities ofraces, nations, and individual men. While incarnating, and in other cases only informing the human vehicles evolved bythe first brainless (manasless) race, the incarnating Powers and Principles had to make their choice between, and take"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"into account, the past Karmas of the Monads, between which and their bodies they had to become the connecting link.Besides which, as correctly stated in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" (p. 30), \"the fifth principle, or human (intellectual) soul, in themajority of mankind is not even yet fully developed.\"** It is said by Krishna, the Logos incarnate, in the Bhagavat-gita, \"The seven great Rishis, the four preceding Manus,partaking of my nature, were born from my mind: from them sprang (emanated or was born) the human race and theworld,\" (Chap. X. Verse 6.)Here, by the seven great Rishis, the seven great rupa hierarchies or classes of Dhyan Chohans, are meant. Let us bearin mind that the Saptarshi (the seven Rishis) are the regents of the seven stars of the Great Bear, therefore, of the samenature as the angels of the planets, or the seven great Planetary Spirits. They were all reborn, all men on earth in variousKalpas and races. Moreover, \"the four preceding Manus\" are the four classes of the originally arupa gods -- the Kumaras,the Rudras, the Asuras, etc.: who are also said to have incarnated. They are not the Prajapatis, as the first are, but theirinforming principles -- some of which have incarnated in men, while others have made other men simply the vehicles oftheir reflections. As Krishna truly says --the same words being repeated later by another vehicle of the LOGOS -- \"I amthe same to all beings. . . . those who worship me (the 6th principle or the intellectual divine Soul, Buddhi, madeconscious by its union with the higher faculties of Manas) are in me, and I am in them.\" (Ibid, 29.) The Logos, being nopersonality but the universal principle, is represented by all the divine Powers born of its mind -- the pure Flames, or, asthey are called in Occultism, the \"Intellectual Breaths\" -- those angels who are said to have made themselvesindependent, i.e., passed from the passive and quiescent, into the active state of Self-Consciousness. When this isrecognised, the true meaning of Krishna becomes comprehensible. But see Mr. Subba Row's excellent lecture on theBhagavatgita, (\"Theosophist,\" April 1887, p. 444.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 319 DEGENERATION OF MANKIND.ing, while their pastoral brethren enjoyed wondrous powers as their birthright, they, the builders, could now obtain theirsonly gradually; even these being generally used for power over physical nature and selfish and unholy purposes.Civilization has ever developed the physical and the intellectual at the cost of the psychic and spiritual. The commandand the guidance over his own psychic nature, which foolish men now associate with the supernatural, were with earlyHumanity innate and congenital, and came to man as naturally as walking and thinking. \"There is no such thing as magic\"philosophises \"SHE,\" the author forgetting that \"magic\" in her early day still meant the great SCIENCE of WIDOM, andthat Ayesha could not possibly know anything of the modern perversion of thought -- \"though there is such a thing asknowledge of the Secrets of Nature.\" (p. 152). But they have become \"Secrets\" only in our race, and were public propertywith the Third.Gradually, mankind went down in stature, for, even before the real advent of the Fourth or Atlantean race, the majority ofmankind had fallen into iniquity and sin, save the hierarchy of the \"Elect,\" the followers and disciples of the \"Sons of Willand Yoga\" -- called later the \"Sons of the Fire Mist.\"Then came the Atlanteans; the giants whose physical beauty and strength reached their climax, in accordance withevolutionary law, toward the middle period of their fourth sub-race. But, as said in the Commentary:--The last survivors of the fair child of the White Island (the primitive Sveta-dwipa) had perished ages before. Their(Lemuria's) elect, had taken shelter on the sacred Island (now the \"fabled\" Shamballah, in the Gobi Desert), while someof their accursed races, separating from the main stock, now lived in the jungles and underground (\"cave-men\"), when thegolden yellow race (the Fourth) became in its turn \"black with sin.\" From pole to pole the Earth had changed her face forthe third time, and was no longer inhabited by the Sons of Sveta-dwipa, the blessed, and Adbhitanya, east and west, thefirst, the one and the pure, had become corrupted. . . . The demi-gods of the Third had made room for the semi-demonsof the Fourth Race. Sveta-dwipa, whose northern parts of the Toyambudhi the seven Kumaras (Sanaka, Sananda,Sanatana, Sanatkumara, Jata, Vodhu, and Panchasikha) had visited, agreeably with exoteric tradition (See the UttaraKhanda of the Padma Purana; Asiat. Researches also, Vol. XI., pp. 99, 100); the White Island had veiled her face. Herchildren now lived on the Black land, wherein, later on, Daityas from the seventh Dwipa (Pushkara) and Rakshasas fromthe seventh------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 320 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.climate replaced the Saddhus and the ascetics of the Third age, who \"had descended to them from other and higherregions.\" . . . .It is evident that, taken in their dead letter, the Puranas read as an absurd tissue of fairy tales and no better. But if onereads chapters I., II. and III. from Book II. (Vol. II.) of Vishnu Purana and accepts verbatim its geography, geodesy, andethnology, in the matter of Priyavrata's seven sons, among whom the father divides the seven Dwipas (ContinentalIslands); and then proceeds to study how the eldest son, the King of Jambu-dwipa, Agnidhra, apportioned Jambu-dwipaamong his nine sons; and then how Nabhi his son, who had a hundred sons and apportioned all these in his turn -- thenthe reader is likely to throw the book away and pronounce it a farrago of nonsense. But the esoteric student willunderstand that, in the days when the Puranas were written, the true meaning was clear only to the Initiated Brahmins,who wrote those works allegorically and would not give the whole truth to the masses. And he will explain to theOrientalists who, beginning with Colonel Wilford and ending with Professor Weber, made and still are making such amess of it, that the first three chapters (See Wilson's trans. of Vishnu Purana Book II et seq.) purposely confuse thefollowing subjects and events:--I. The series of Kalpas or Ages (also of Races) are never taken into account; e.g., events which have happened in onebeing allowed to stand along with those which took place in another. The chronological order is entirely ignored. This isshown by several of the Sanskrit commentators, who explain the incompatibility of events and calculations in saying --\"Whenever any contradictions in different Puranas are observed, they are ascribed . . . to differences of Kalpas and thelike\" (Vishnu and Bhagavata Puranas)."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"II. The several meanings of the words \"Manvantara\" and \"Kalpa\" or age, are withheld, and the general one only given.III. In the genealogy and geography of the Kings and their Varshas (countries) and Dwipas, they are all allowed to beregarded as terrestrial regions.Now, the truth is that, without entering into too minute details, it is easy and permissible to show that:--(a) The Seven Dwipas apportioned to Priyavrata's septenary progeny refer to several localities: first of all to our planetarychain. Jambu-dwipa alone representing our globe, the six others are the (to us) invisible companion globes of this earth.This is shown by the very nature of the allegorical and symbolic descriptions. Jambu (dwipa) \"is in the centre of all these(the so-called insular continents) and is surrounded\" by a sea of salt water (lavana), whereas Plaksha, Salmalia,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 321 THE HINDU SYMBOLIZATION.Kusa, Krauncha, Saka and Pushkara, are \"surrounded severally -- by great seas of sugar-cane juice, of wine, of clarifiedbutter, of curds, of milk,\" etc., etc., and such like metaphorical names. (Chap. II, Book II) This is shown furthermore by --(b) Bhaskara Acharya, who uses expressions from the Secret Doctrine and its books, in his description of the siderealposition of all these dwipas:-- \"the sea of milk and the sea of curds\" etc., meaning the Milky Way, and the variouscongeries of nebulae; the more so, since he names \"the country to the south of the equator Bhur-loka, that to the northBhuva-loka, Swar, Mahar, Jana, Tapo and Satya lokas\"; and says: \"Those lokas are gradually attained by increasingreligious merits,\" i.e., they are various paradises. (See Bibliotheca Indica. Trans. of the Goladhyaya of the Siddhanta-siromani III., 21-44).(c) That this geographical division of seven allegorical continents, islands, mountains, seas and countries, does notbelong only to our Round nor even to our races (the name of Bharata Varsha (India) notwithstanding), is explained in thetexts themselves by the narrator of Vishnu Purana. For he closes the first chapter by saying: \"Bharata (the son of Nabhi,who gave his name to Bharata-Varsha or India) consigned the Kingdom to his son Sumati . . . . and abandoned his life atSalagrama. He was afterwards born again as a religious Brahman, in a distinguished family of ascetics . . . . under theseprinces (Bharata's descendants) Bharata Varsha was divided into nine portions, and their descendants held successivelypossession of the country for seventy-one periods of the aggregate of the four ages,\" or the reign of a Manu, representinga Mahayuga of 4,320,000 years.But having said so much, Parasara suddenly explains that \"this was the creation of Swayambhuva Manu, by which theearth was peopled when he presided over the first Manvantara, in the Kalpa of Varaha,\" i.e., the boar incarnation, orAvatar. Now every Brahmin knows that it is only with Vaivasvata Manu that our Humanity began on this Earth (or Round).And if the Western reader turns to the sub-section on \"The Primeval Manus of Humanity,\" he will see that Vaivasvata isthe seventh of the fourteen Manus who preside over our planetary chain during its life cycle: i.e., that representing orstanding in every Round for two Manus of the same name (a Root and a Seed Manu), he is the Root Manu of the FourthRound, hence the seventh. Wilson finds in this only \"an incongruity\" (see his Vishnu Purana, vol. II., p. 108, footnote), andspeculates that \"the patriarchial genealogies are older than the chronological system of Manvantaras and Kalpas,\" andthus \"have been rather clumsily distributed amongst the different periods.\" It is nothing of the kind.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 322 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.But as Orientalists know nothing of the secret teaching, they will take everything literally, and then turn round and abusethe writers of that which they do not comprehend!These genealogies embrace a period of three and a half Rounds; they speak of pre-human periods, and explain thedescent into generation of every Manu -- the first manifested sparks of the ONE Unity -- and show, furthermore, each ofthese human sparks dividing into, and multiplying by, first, the Pitars, the human ancestors, then by human Races. Nobeing can become God, or Deva, unless he passes through the human cycles. Therefore the Sloka says, \"Happy arethose who are born, even from the (latent) condition of gods, as men, in Bharata-varsha; as that is the way to . . . finalliberation.\" In Jambu-dwipa, Bharata is considered the best of its divisions, because IT IS THE LAND OF WORKS. In italone \"it is that the succession of four Yugas (ages), the Krita, the Treta, the Dwapara, and Kali take place\"; when,therefore, Parasara, asked by Maitreya \"to give him the descriptions of the Earth,\" returns again to the enumeration of thesame Dwipas with the same seas, etc., as those he had described in the Swayambhuva Manvantara -- it is simply a blind,yet, to him who reads between the lines, the Four great Races and the Fifth are there, ay, with their sub-divisions, islands,and continents, some of which were called by the names of celestial lokas, and by those of other globes. Hence theconfusion.All these are called by the Orientalists \"mythical\" and \"fabulous\" islands and lands.* Very true, some are not of this earth,but they still exist. The \"White Island\" and Atala, at all events, are no myths, since the latter was the namecontemptuously applied by the earliest pioneers of the Fifth Race to the land of Sin -- Atlantis, in general, not to Plato'sisland alone; and since the former was (a) the Sveta-dwipa of theogony, and (b) Saka-dwipa, or Atlantis (its earliestportions) in its beginnings. This was when it yet had its \"seven holy rivers that washed away all sin,\" and its \"sevendistricts, wherein there was no dereliction of virtue, no contention, no deviation from virtue,\" as it was then inhabited bythe caste of the Magas -- that caste which even the Brahmins acknowledged as not inferior to their own -- and which was[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In a lecture, Professor Pengelly, F.R.S., quoting Professor Oliver, makes him say \"that the present Atlantic islands' Floraaffords no substantial evidence of a former direct communication with the mainland of the New World,\" but himself addsthat, at the same time, \"at some period of the Tertiary epoch, N. E. Asia was united to N. W. America, perhaps by the line"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"where the Aleutian chain of islands now extends.\" Thus Occult Science alone can reconcile the contradictions andhesitations of modern Science. Moreover, surely the argument for the existence of Atlantis does not rest on Botany alone.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 323 THE MAGIS IN THE DAYS OF KRISHNA.the nursery of the first Zaratushta. The Brahmins are shown consulting with Gauramukha, on Narada's advice, who toldthem to invite the Magas as priests of the Sun in the temple built by Samba (the reputed) son of Krishna, who in realityhad none. In this the Puranas are historical --allegory notwithstanding -- and Occultism is stating facts.The whole story is told in Bhavishya Purana. It is stated that, having been cured by Surya (the Sun) of leprosy, Samba,having built a temple dedicated to the Sun, was looking for pious Brahmins to perform the appointed rites in it, andreceive donations made to the God. But Narada (this virgin ascetic whom one finds in every age in the Puranas) advisedhim not to do so, as Manu forbade the Brahmins to receive emoluments for the performance of religious rites. Hetherefore referred Samba to Gauramukha (white face), the Purohita or family priest of Hgrasena, King of Mathura, whowould tell him whom he could best employ. The priest directed Samba to invite the Magas, the worshippers of Surya, todischarge the duty. Ignorant of the place they lived in, it is Surya, the Sun himself, who directs Samba to Sakadwipabeyond the salt water. Then Samba performs the journey, using Garuda (Vishnu's and Krishna's vehicle, the great Bird)who lands him among the Magas, etc.Now Krishna, who lived 5,000 years ago, and Narada, who is found reborn in every cycle (or race), besides Garuda -- thesymbol esoterically of the great cycle -- show the allegory; yet the Magas are the Magi of Chaldea, and their class andworship were born on the earlier Atlantis, in Saka-dwipa, the Sinless. All the Orientalists are agreed that the Magas ofSaka-dwipa are the forefathers of the fire-worshipping Parsis. Our quarrel with them rests, as usual, on their dwarfinghundreds of thousands to a few centuries this time: they carry the event -- Narada and Samba notwithstanding -- to thedays of the flight of the Parsis to Gujerat, which is simply absurd, as that was in the VIIIth cent. of our era. Though theMagas in the Bhavishya Purana are credited with still living in Saka-dwipa in the day of Krishna's Son, yet the last of it --Plato's \"Atlantis\" -- had perished 6000 years before. They were Mag \"late of\" Saka-Dwipa, and lived in those days inChaldea. This is an intentional confusion, again.The earliest pioneers of the Fourth Race were not Atlanteans, nor yet the human Asuras and the Rakshasas which theybecame later. In those days large portions of the future continent of Atlantis were yet part and parcel of the Ocean floors.\"Lemuria,\" as we have called the continent of the Third Race, was then a gigantic land.* It covered[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* As shown in the Introduction, it stands to reason that neither the name of Lemuria nor even Atlantis are the real archaicnames of the lost continents, but have been adopted by us for the sake of clearness. Atlantis was the name given tothose [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 324 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the whole area of space from the foot of the Himalayas, which separated it from the inland sea rolling its waves over whatis now Tibet, Mongolia, and the great desert of Schamo (Gobi); from Chittagong, westward to Hardwar, and eastward toAssam. From thence, it stretched South across what is known to us as Southern India, Ceylon, and Sumatra; thenembracing on its way, as we go South, Madagascar on its right hand and Australia and Tasmania on its left, it ran downto within a few degrees of the Antarctic Circle; when, from Australia, an inland region on the Mother Continent in thoseages, it extended far into the Pacific Ocean, not only beyond Rapa-nui (Teapy, or Easter Island) which now lies in latitude26 S., and longitude 110 W. (See Addenda to this Book II., Section, \"Proofs of the Submerged Continents.\") Thisstatement seems corroborated by Science, -- even if only partially; as, when discussing continental trends, and showingthe infra-Arctic masses trending generally with the Meridian, several ancient continents are generally mentioned, thoughinferentially. Among such the \"Mascarene continent,\" which included Madagascar, stretching north and south, is spokenof, and the existence of another ancient continent running \"from Spitzbergen to the Straits of Dover, while most of theother parts of Europe were sea bottom,\" is taught.* The latter corroborates, then, the Occult teaching which shows the(now) polar regions as the earliest of the seven cradles of Humanity, and as the tomb of the bulk of the mankind of thatregion during the Third Race, when the gigantic continent of Lemuria began separating into smaller continents. This isdue, according to the explanation in the Commentary, to a decrease of velocity in the earth's rotation:--\"When the Wheel runs at the usual rate, its extremities (the poles) agree with its middle circle (equator), when it runsslower and tilts in every direction, there is a great disturbance on the face of the Earth. The waters flow toward[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] portions of the submerged Fourth-Race continent which were \"beyond thepillars of Hercules,\" and which happened to keep above water after the general cataclysm. The last remnant of these --Plato's Atlantis, or the \"Poseidon\" (another substitute or rather a translation of the real name) -- was the last of it some11,000 years ago. Most of the correct names of the countries and islands of both continents are given in the Puranas; butto mention them specially, as found in other more ancient works, such as the Surya Siddhanta, would necessitate toolengthy explanations. If, in earlier writings, the two seem to have been too faintly disconnected, this must be due tocareless reading and want of reflection. If ages hence, Europeans are referred to as Aryans, and a reader confuses themwith the Hindus and the latter with the Fourth Race, as they live (some of them) in ancient Lanka -- the blame will not fallon the writer.* See Professor Dana's article, \"American Journal of Science,\" III, v. 442-3; Prof. Winchell's \"World Life\"; and othergeological works.------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"[[Vol. 2, Page]] 325 ATLANTIS -- OCEAN FLOOR.the two ends, and new lands arise in the middle belt (equatorial lands), while those at the ends are subject to pralayas bysubmersion . . . .\"And again:--. . . \"Thus the wheel (the Earth) is subject to, and regulated by, the Spirit of the Moon, for the breath of its waters (tides).Toward the close of the age (Kalpa) of a great (root) race, the regents of the moon (the Pitar fathers, or Pitris) begindrawing harder, and thus flatten the wheel about its belt, when it goes down in some places and swells in others, and theswelling running toward the extremities (poles) new lands will arise and old ones be sucked in.\"We have but to read astronomical and geological works, to see the meaning of the above very clearly. Scientists (modernSpecialists) have ascertained the influence of the tides on the geological distribution of land and water on the planets,and the shifting of the oceans with a corresponding subsidence and rise of continents and new lands. Science knows, orthinks it knows, that this occurs periodically.* Professor Todd believes he can trace the series of oscillations backward tothe periods of the earth's first incrustation. (See \"American Naturalist,\" XVIII., 15 et seq.); therefore it seems easy forScience to verify the Esoteric statements. We propose to treat of this at greater length in the Addenda. (Vide § § V. andVI.)It is asked by some Theosophists: \"What will Atlantis be like when raised?\" they understanding from a few words in\"Esoteric Buddhism\" that \"old continents\" that have been submerged will reappear. Here, again, there is a slightmisconception. Were the same identical lands of Atlantis that were submerged to be raised again, then they would,indeed, be barren for ages. Because the Atlantic sea-bottom is covered with some 5,000 feet of chalk at present, andmore is forming -- a new \"cretaceous formation\" of strata, in fact -- is no reason why, when the time for a new continent toappear arrives, a geological convulsion and upraising of the sea bottom should not dispose of these 5,000 feet of chalkfor the formation of some mountains and 5,000 more come to the surface. The racial cataclysms are not a Noah's delugeof forty days -- a kind of Bombay monsoon.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Speaking on periodical elevation and subsidence of the equatorial and polar regions, and ensuing changes of climate,Mr. Winchell (professor of Geology at Michigan) says -- \"As the movements here contemplated are cyclical, the sameconditions would recur again and again; and accordingly the same fauna might return again and again to the sameregion, with intervals of occupation by another fauna. Progressive sedimentation would preserve the records of suchfaunal alterations; and there would be presented the phenomena of 'colonies' 're-apparitions' and other faunaldislocations in the vertical and horizontal distributions of fossil remains. These phenomena are well known to the studentof geology.\" (\"Effects of Astronomical Changes.\")------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 326 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.That the periodical sinking and re-appearance of the mighty continents, now called Atlantis and Lemuria by the modernwriters, is no fiction, will be demonstrated in the Section in which all the proofs of the same have been collated together.The most archaic Sanskrit and Tamil works teem with references to both Continents. The seven sacred Islands (Dwipas)are mentioned in the Surya Siddhanta, the oldest astronomical work in the whole world, and in the works of Asura Maya,the Atlantean astronomer whom Professor Weber has made out re-incarnated in Ptolemy. Yet, it is a mistake to call these\"sacred islands\" Atlantean -- as done by us; for, like everything else in the Hindu Sacred Books, they are made to refer toseveral things. The heirloom left by Priyavrata, the Son of Swayambhuva Manu, to his seven sons -- was not Atlantis,even though one or two of these islands survived the subsidence of their fellows, and offered shelter, ages later, toAtlanteans, whose continent had been submerged in its turn. When originally mentioned by Parasara (Vishnu Purana) theseven refer to an esoteric doctrine which is explained further on. Of all the seven islands, Jambu-dwipa is the only onethat is terrestrial, for it is our globe. In the Puranas every reference to the North of Meru is connected with that primevalEldorado, now the North Polar region; which, when the magnolia blossomed there where now we see an unexploredendless desert of ice, was then a continent again. Science speaks of an ancient continent which stretched fromSpitzbergen down to the Straits of Dover. The Secret Doctrine teaches that, in the earliest geological periods, theseregions formed a horse-shoe-like continent, whose one end, the Eastern, far more northward than North Cornwall,included Greenland, and the other contained Behring Straits as an inland piece of ground, and descended southward inits natural trend down to the British Isles, which in those days must have been right under the lower curve of the semi-circle. This continent was raised simultaneously with the submersion of the equatorial portions of Lemuria. Ages later,some of the Lemurian remains re-appeared again on the face of the Oceans. Therefore, though it can be said withoutdeparting from truth that Atlantis is included in the Seven great insular continents, since the Fourth Race Atlanteans gotsome of the Lemurian relics, and, settling on the islands, included them among their lands and continents, yet adifference should be made and an explanation given, once that a fuller and more accurate account is attempted, as in thepresent work. Easter Island was also taken possession of in this manner by some Atlanteans; who, having escaped fromthe cataclysm which befell their own land, settled on that remnant of Lemuria only to perish thereon, when destroyed inone day by its volcanic fires and lava. This may be regarded as fiction by certain geographers and geologists; to theOccul-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 327 ON FOOT ACROSS THE OCEANS.tists it is history.

But here we have one oftheir own flock, and a bird of the same feather -- Ernest Haeckel, who, in his distribution of races, corroborates thestatement almost verbatim: . . . . \"It would seem that the region on the earth's surface where the evolution of theseprimitive men from the CLOSELY RELATED CATARRHINE APES (! !) took place, must be sought either in Southern Asiaor Eastern Africa [which, by the bye, was not even in existence when the Third Race flourished -- H.P.B.] or in Lemuria.Lemuria is an ancient continent now sunk beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean, which, lying to the South of the Asia ofto-day, stretched on the one hand eastwards to upper India and Sunda Island, on the other westward as far asMadagascar and Africa.\" (See supra and compare \"The Pedigree of Man,\" p. 80-81.)In the epoch we are treating of, the Continent of \"Lemuria,\" had already broken asunder in many places, and formed newseparate continents. There was, nevertheless, neither Africa nor the Americas, still less Europe in those days, all theseslumbering yet on the Ocean floors. Nor was there much of present Asia; for the cis-Himalayan regions were covered withseas, and beyond this stretched the \"lotus leaves\" of Sveta-dwipa, the countries now called Greenland, Eastern andWestern Siberia, etc., etc. The immense Continent, which had once reigned supreme over the Indian, Atlantic, and PacificOceans, now consisted of huge islands which were gradually disappearing one after the other, until the final convulsionengulfed the last remains of it. Easter Isle, for instance, belongs to the earliest civilisation of the Third------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 328 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Race. Submerged with the rest, a volcanic and sudden uplifting of the Ocean floor, raised the small relic of the Archaicages untouched, with its volcano and statues, during the Champlain epoch of northern polar submersion, as a standingwitness to the existence of Lemuria. It is said that some of the Australian tribes are the last remnants of the lastdescendants of the Third Race.In this we are again corroborated to a degree by materialistic Science. Haeckel, when speaking of Blumenbach's brownor Malay race and the Australians and Papuans, remarks:-- \"There is much likeness between these last and theAborigines of Polynesia, that Australian island-world, that seems to have been once on a time a gigantic and continuouscontinent.\" (\"Pedigree of Man,\" p. 82. But see footnote supra and the Addenda.)It certainly was, since it stretched, during the Third Race, east and west, as far as where the two Americas now lie, andsince the present Australia is but a portion of it, as are also a few surviving islands sown hither and thither on the face ofthe Pacific and a large bit of California, which belonged to it. Funnily enough, Haeckel, in his fantastic \"Pedigree of Man,\"considers \"the Australians of to-day as the lineal descendants, almost unchanged (? !), of that second branch of theprimitive human race. . . that spread northwards, at first chiefly in Asia, from the home of man's infancy, and seems tohave been the parent of all the other straight-haired races of men. . . . The one, woolly-haired, migrated in part,westwards\" . . . (i.e., to Africa and northwards to New Guinea, which countries had then, as said, no existence as yet) . . .\"the other, straight-haired, was evolved farther to the north in Asia . . . . and peopled Australia . . . \" (p. 81). \"Behold,\"writes a MASTER, \"the relics of that once great nation (Lemuria of the Third Race) in some of the flat-headed aboriginesof your Australia\" (\"Esoteric Buddhism,\" p. 65). But they belong to the last remnants of the Seventh Sub-race of the Third.Prof. Haeckel must also have dreamt a dream and seen for once a true vision!It is to this period that we have to look for the first appearance of the Ancestors of those, who are termed by us the mostancient peoples of the world -- now called respectively the Aryan Hindus, the Egyptians, and the oldest Persians, on theone hand, and the Chaldees and Phoenicians on the other. These were governed by the DIVINE DYNASTIES, i.e., kingsand rulers who had of mortal man only his physical appearance as it was then, but who were Beings from spheres higherand more celestial than our own sphere will be, long Manvantaras hence. It is useless of course to attempt to force theirexistence on sceptics. Their greatest pride consists in proving their patronymic denomination as catarrhinides; which factthey try to demonstrate on the alleged------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 329 CHANGES OF CLIMATE.authority of the Coccyx appended to their os sacrum, that rudimentary tail which, if they only had it long enough, theywould wag in joy and for ever, in honour of its eminent discoverer. These will remain as faithful to their ape-ancestors asChristians will to tailless Adam. The Secret Doctrine, however, sets right on this point theosophists and students of OccultSciences.If we regard the Second portion of the Third Race as the first representatives of the really human race with solid bones,then Haeckel's surmise that \"the evolution of the primitive men took place . . . . in either Southern Asia or . . . . Lemuria\" --Africa, whether Eastern or Western being out of question -- is correct enough, if not entirely so. To be accurate, however,in the same way that the evolution of the First Race (from the bodies of the pitars) took place on seven distinctlyseparated regions of the (then) only Earth at the arctic pole -- so did the ultimate transformation of the Third occur: itbegan in those northern regions, which have just been described a few pages back as including Behring's Straits, andwhat there then was of dry land in Central Asia, when the climate was semi-tropical even in the Arctic regions and mostadapted to the primitive wants of nascent physical man. That region, however, has been more than once frigid andtropical in turn since the appearance of man. The commentary tells us that the Third Race was only about the middlepoint of its development when:--\"The axle of the Wheel tilted. The Sun and Moon shone no longer over the heads of that portion of the SWEAT BORN;people knew snow, ice, and frost, and men, plants, and animals were dwarfed in their growth. Those that did not perishREMAINED AS HALF-GROWN BABES* IN SIZE AND INTELLECT.

Forthe Secret Doctrine teaches that, during this Round, there must be seven terrestrial pralayas, three occasioned by thechange in the inclination of the earth's axis. It is a law which acts at its appointed time, and not at all blindly, as sciencemay think, but in strict accordance and harmony with Karmic law. In Occultism this inexorable law is referred to as \"thegreat ADJUSTER.\" Science confesses its ignorance of the cause producing climatic vicissitudes and such changes in theaxial direction, which are always followed by these vicissitudes; nor does it seem so sure of the axial changes. And beingunable to account for them, it is prepared rather to deny the axial phenomena altogether, than admit the intelligent Karmichand and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Half-grown babes\" in comparison with their giant Brethren on other zones.

It has tried to account for them byvarious more or less fantastic speculations; one of which would be the sudden, and as imaginary, collision of our earthwith a comet (De Boucheporn's hypothesis), as the cause of all the geological revolutions. But we prefer holding to ouresoteric explanation, since FOHAT is as good as any comet, having, in addition, universal intelligence to guide him.Thus, since Vaivasvata Manu's Humanity appeared on this Earth, there have already been four such axial disturbances;when the old continents -- save the first one -- were sucked in by the oceans, other lands appeared, and huge mountainchains arose where there had been none before. The face of the Globe was completely changed each time; the survivalof the fittest nations and races was secured through timely help; and the unfit ones -- the failures -- were disposed of bybeing swept off the earth. Such sorting and shifting does not happen between sunset and sunrise, as one may think, butrequires several thousands of years before the new house is set in order.The Sub-races are subject to the same cleansing process, as also the side-branchlets (the family-Races). Let one, well-acquainted with astronomy and mathematics, throw a retrospective glance into the twilight and shadows of the Past. Lethim observe, take notes of what he knows of the history of peoples and nations, and collate their respective rises andfalls with what is known of astronomical cycles -- especially with the Sidereal year, equal to 25,868 of our solar years.* Ifthe observer is gifted with the faintest intuition, then will he find how the weal and woe of nations is intimately connectedwith the beginning and close of this sidereal cycle. True, the non-occultist has the disadvantage that he has no such fardistant times to rely upon. He knows nothing, through exact Science, of what took place nearly 10,000 years ago; yet hemay find consolation in the knowledge or -- if he so prefers -- speculation on the fate of every one of the modern nationshe knows of -- about 16,000 years hence.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* There are other cycles, of course, cycles within cycles -- and this is just that which creates such a difficulty in thecalculations of racial events. The circuit of the ecliptic is completed in 25,868 years. And, with regard to our Earth, it iscalculated that the equinoctial point falls back fifty minutes ten seconds, annually. But there is another cycle within thisone. It is said that \"as the apsis goes forward to meet it at the rate of eleven minutes twenty-four seconds, annually,\" (seethe article on Astronomy in Encyclopaedia Britannica), \"this would complete a revolution in one hundred and fifteenthousand three hundred and two years (115,302). The approximation of the equinox and the apsis is the sum of thesemotions, sixty-one minutes thirty-four seconds, and hence the equinox returns to the same position in relation to the apsisin 21,128 years.\" We have mentioned this cycle in Isis Unveiled, Vol. I., in relation to other cycles. Each has a markedinfluence on its contemporary race.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 331 PRE-HISTORIC STATUES.Our meaning is very clear. Every sidereal year the tropics recede from the pole four degrees in each revolution from theequinoctial points, as the equator rounds through the Zodiacal constellations. Now, as every astronomer knows, atpresent the tropic is only twenty-three degrees and a fraction less than half a degree from the equator. Hence it has still 21/2 degrees to run before the end of the Sidereal year; which gives humanity in general, and our civilized races inparticular, a reprieve of about 16,000 years.*After the Great Flood of the Third Race (the Lemurians) --\"Men decreased considerably in stature, and the duration of their lives was diminished. Having fallen down in godlinessthey mixed with animal races, and intermarried among giants and Pigmies (the dwarfed races of the Poles) . . .

How many geological periods it took to accomplish thisfourth destruction? Who can tell. . . . But we are told that ---------(44.)

Thewriter is well aware that the modern archaeologists have decided now that \"these statues are not very old,\" as declaredby one of the high officials of the British Museum, where some of them now are. But this is one of those arbitrarydecisions of modern science which does not carry much weight.We are told that it is after the destruction of \"Lemuria\" by subterranean fires that men went on steadily decreasing instature -- a process already commenced after their physical FALL -- and that finally, some millions of years after, theyreached between six and seven feet, and are now dwindling down (as the older Asiatic races) to nearer five than[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See at the end of this Stanza \"On the Duration of Ages and Cycles.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 332 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.six feet. As Pickering shows, there is in the Malay race (a sub-race of the Fourth Root Race) a singular diversity ofstature; the members of the Polynesian family (Tahitians, Samoans, and Tonga islanders) are of a higher stature than therest of mankind; but the Indian tribes and the inhabitants of the Indo-Chinese countries are decidedly below the generalaverage. This is easily explained. The Polynesians belong to the very earliest of the surviving sub-races, the others to thevery last and transitory stock. As the Tasmanians are now completely extinct, and the Australians rapidly dying out, so willthe other old races soon follow.(b) Now, how could those records have been preserved? we may be asked. Even the knowledge of the Zodiac is deniedto the Hindus by our kind and learned Orientalists, who conclude that the Aryan Hindus knew nothing of it, before theGreeks brought it into the country. This uncalled-for slander was so sufficiently refuted by Bailly, and what is more, by theclear evidence of facts, as not to need very much additional refutation. While the Egyptians have on their Zodiacs (SeeDenon's \"Voyage en Egypte\" Vol. II.) irrefutable proofs of records having embraced more than three-and-a-half siderealyears -- or about 87,000 years -- the Hindu calculations cover nearly thirty-three such years, or 850,000 years. TheEgyptian priests assured Herodotus that the Pole of the Earth and the Pole of the Ecliptic had formerly coincided. But, asremarked by the author of the Sphinxiad, \"These poor benighted Hindoos have registered a knowledge of Astronomy forten times 25,000 years since the (last local) Flood (in Asia), or Age of Horror,\" in the latitude of India. And they possessrecorded observations from the date of the first Great Flood within the Aryan historical memory -- that which submergedthe last portions of Atlantis, 850,000 years ago. The floods which preceded are, of course, more traditional than historical.The sinking and transformation of Lemuria beginning nearly at the Arctic Circle (Norway), the Third Race ended its careerin Lanka, or rather on that which became Lanka with the Atlanteans. The small remnant now known as Ceylon is theNorthern highland of ancient Lanka, while the enormous island of that name was, in the Lemurian period, the giganticcontinent described a few pages back. As a MASTER says (See \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" p. 65):-- \"Why should not yourgeologists bear in mind that under the continents explored and fathomed by them . . . . there may be hidden, deep in thefathomless, or rather unfathomed ocean beds, other and far older continents whose strata have never been geologicallyexplored; and that they may some day upset entirely their present theories? Why not admit that our present continentshave, like Lemuria and Atlantis,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 333 THE OLD CONTINENTS.been several times already submerged, and had the time to re-appear again and bear their new groups of mankind andcivilisations; and that at the first great geological upheaval at the next cataclysm, in the series of periodical cataclysmsthat occur from the beginning to the end of every Round, our already autopsized continents will go down and theLemurias and Atlantises come up again?\"Not the same identical continents, of course.But here an explanation is needed. No confusion need arise as regards the postulation of a Northern \"Lemuria.\" Theprolongation of that great continent into the North Atlantic Ocean is in no way subversive of the opinions so widely held asto the site of the lost Atlantis, and one corroborates the other. It must be noted that the Lemuria, which served as thecradle of the Third Root-Race, not only embraced a vast area in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but extended in theshape of a horse-shoe past Madagascar, round \"South Africa\" (then a mere fragment in process of formation), throughthe Atlantic up to Norway. The great English fresh-water deposit called the Wealden -- which every geologist regards asthe mouth of a former great river -- is the bed of the main stream which drained Northern Lemuria in the Secondary Age.The former reality of this river is a fact of science -- will its votaries acknowledge the necessity of accepting theSecondary-age Northern Lemuria, which their data demand? Professor Berthold Seeman not only accepted the reality ofsuch a mighty continent, but regarded Australia and Europe as formerly portions of one continent -- thus corroborating thewhole \"horse-shoe\" doctrine already enunciated. No more striking confirmation of our position could be given, than thefact that the ELEVATED RIDGE in the Atlantic basin, 9,000 feet in height, which runs for some two or three thousandmiles southwards from a point near the British Islands, first slopes towards South America, then shifts almost at rightangles to proceed in a SOUTH-EASTERLY line toward the African coast, whence it runs on southward to Tristand'Acunha. This ridge is a remnant of an Atlantic continent, and, could it be traced further, would establish the reality of asubmarine horse-shoe junction with a former continent in the Indian Ocean. (Cf. chart adapted from the \"Challenger\" and\"Dolphin\" soundings in Mr. Donnelly's, \"Atlantis, the Antediluvian World,\" p. 47.)The Atlantic portion of Lemuria was the geological basis of what is generally known as Atlantis. The latter, indeed, mustbe regarded rather as a development of the Atlantic prolongation of Lemuria, than as an entirely new mass of landupheaved to meet the special requirements of the Fourth Root-Race. Just as in the case of Race-evolution, so in that ofthe shifting and re-shifting of continental masses, no hard and fast line can be drawn where a new order ends andanother begins. Continuity in natural processes is never broken. Thus the Fourth Race"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 334 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Atlanteans were developed from a nucleus of Northern Lemurian Third Race Men, centred, roughly speaking, toward apoint of land in what is now the mid-Atlantic Ocean. Their continent was formed by the coalescence of many islands andpeninsulas which were upheaved in the ordinary course of time and became ultimately the true home of the great Raceknown as the Atlanteans. After this consummation was once attained it follows, as stated on the highest \"occult\" authority,that \"Lemuria should no more be confounded with the Atlantis Continent, than Europe with America.\" (\"EsotericBuddhism,\" p. 58.)The above, coming from quarters so discredited by orthodox Science, will, of course, be regarded by it as a more or lesshappy fiction. Even the clever work of Donnelly, already mentioned, is put aside, notwithstanding that its statements areall confined within a frame of strictly scientific proofs. But we write for the future. Discoveries in this direction will vindicatethe claims of the Asiatic philosophers, who maintain that Sciences -- Geology, Ethnology, and History included --werepursued by the Antediluvian nations who lived an untold number of ages ago. Future finds will justify the correctness ofthe present observations of such acute minds as H. A. Taine and Renan. The former shows that the civilizations of sucharchaic nations as the Egyptians, Aryans of India, Chaldeans, Chinese, and Assyrians are the result of precedingcivilizations during \"myriads of centuries\";* and the latter points to the fact that, \"Egypt at the beginning appears mature,old, and entirely without mythical and heroic ages, as if the country had never known youth. Its civilization has no infancy,and its art no archaic period. The civilization of the Old Monarchy did not begin with infancy. It was already mature.\"** Tothis Professor R. Owen adds that, \"Egypt is recorded to have been a civilized and governed community before the time ofMenes\"; and Winchell (\"Pre-Adamites,\" p. 120), that \"at the epoch of Menes the Egyptians were already a civilized andnumerous people. Manetho tells us that Athotis, the son of this first king Menes, built the palace of Memphis; that he wasa physician, and left anatomical books.\"This is quite natural if we have to believe the statements of Herodotus, who records in Euterpe (cxlii.), that the writtenhistory of the Egyptian priests dated from about 12,000 years before his time. But what are 12,000 or even 120,000 yearscompared with the millions of years elapsed since the Lemurian period? The latter, however, has not been left withoutwitnesses, its tremendous antiquity, notwithstanding. The complete records of the growth, development, social, and evenpolitical life of the Lemurians, have been preserved in the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"History of English Literature,\" p. 23.** Quoted in \"Atlantis,\" etc., p. 132.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 335 HOW TO READ SYMBOLS.secret annals. Unfortunately, few are those who can read them; and those who could would still be unable to understandthe language, unless acquainted with all the seven keys of its symbolism. For the comprehension of the Occult Doctrine isbased on that of the seven sciences; which sciences find their expression in the seven different applications of the secretrecords to the exoteric texts. Thus we have to deal with modes of thought on seven entirely different planes of Ideality.Every text relates to, and has to be rendered from, one of the following standpoints --1. The Realistic plane of thought;2. The Idealistic;3. The purely Divine or Spiritual.The other planes too far transcend the average consciousness, especially of the materialistic mind, to admit of their beingeven symbolized in terms of ordinary phraseology. There is no purely mythical element in any of the ancient religioustexts; but the mode of thought in which they were originally written has to be found out and closely adhered to during theprocess of interpretation. For, it is either symbolical (archaic mode of thought), emblematical (a later though very ancientmode of thought), parabolical (allegory), hieroglyphical, or again logo-grammical -- the most difficult method of all, asevery letter, as in the Chinese language, represents a whole word. Thus, almost every proper name, whether in theVedas, the \"Book of the Dead,\" or the Bible (to a degree), is composed of such logograms. No one who is not initiatedinto the mystery of the occult religious logography can presume to know what a name in any ancient fragment means,before he has mastered the meaning of every letter that composes it. How is it to be expected that the merely profanethinker, however great his erudition in orthodox symbolism, so to say -- i.e., in that symbolism which can never get out ofthe old grooves of Solar-myth and sexual-worship -- shall penetrate into the arcana. behind the veil. One who deals withthe husk or shell of the dead letter, and devotes himself to the kaleidoscopic transformation of barren word-symbols, cannever expect to get beyond the vagaries of modern mythologists.Thus, Vaivasvata, Xisuthrus, Deukalion, Noah, etc., etc. -- all the head-figures of the world-deluges, universal and partial,astronomical or geological -- all furnish in their very names the records of the causes and effects which led to the event, ifone can but read them fully. All such deluges are based on events that took place in nature, and stand as historicalrecords, therefore, whether they were sidereal, geological, or even simply allegorical, of a moral event on other andhigher planes of being. This we believe has now been sufficiently demonstrated during the long explanation necessitatedby the allegorical Stanzas.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 336 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.To speak of a race nine yatis, or 27 feet high, in a work claiming a more scientific character than \"Jack the Giant-Killer,\" isa somewhat unusual proceeding. \"Where are your proofs?\" the writer will be asked. In History and tradition, is theanswer. Traditions about a race of giants in days of old are universal; they exist in oral and written lore. India had her"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Danavas and Daityas; Ceylon had her Rakshasas; Greece, her Titans; Egypt, her colossal Heroes; Chaldea, her Izdubars(Nimrod); and the Jews their Emims of the land of Moab, with the famous giants, Anakim (Numbers xiii. 33). Mosesspeaks of Og, a king who was nine cubits high (15 ft. 4 in.) and four wide (Deut. iii. 11), and Goliath was \"six cubits and aspan in height\" (or 10 ft. 7 in.). The only difference found between the \"revealed Scripture\" and the evidence furnished tous by Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Homer, Pliny, Plutarch, Philostratus, etc., etc., is this: While the pagans mention onlythe skeletons of giants, dead untold ages before, relics that some of them had personally seen, the Bible interpretersunblushingly demand that geology and archaeology should believe, that several countries were inhabited by such giantsin the day of Moses; giants before whom the Jews were as grasshoppers, and who still existed in the days of Joshua andDavid. Unfortunately their own chronology is in the way. Either the latter or the giants have to be given up. (But see PartIII., Addenda, the closing chapter.)Of still standing witnesses to the submerged continents, and the colossal men that inhabited them, there are still a few.Archaeology claims several such on this globe, though beyond wondering \"what these may be\" -- it never made anyserious attempt to solve the mystery. Besides the Easter Island statues mentioned already, to what epoch do the colossalstatues, still erect and intact near Bamian, belong? Archaeology assigns them to the first centuries of Christianity (asusual), and errs in this as it does in many other speculations. A few words of description will show the readers what arethe statues of both Easter Isle and Bamian. We will first examine what is known of them to orthodox Science. In \"TheCountries of the World,\" by Robert Brown, in Vol. IV., page 43, it is stated that --\"Teapi, Rapa-nui, or Easter Island, is an isolated spot almost 2,000 miles from the South American coast. . . . In length itis about twelve miles, in breadth four . . . and there is an extinct crater 1,050 feet high in its centre. The island abounds incraters, which have been extinct for so long that no tradition of their activity remains. . . .\" . . . But who made the great stone images (p. 44, etc.) which are now the chief attraction of the island to visitors? Noone knows\" -- says the reviewer. \"It is more than likely that they were here when the present inhabitants (a handful ofPolynesian savages) arrived. . . . Their workmanship is------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 337 THE MYSTERY OF EASTER ISLAND.of a high order . . . . and it is believed that the race who formed them were the frequenters of the natives of Peru andother portions of South America. . . Even at the date of Cook's visit, some of the statues, measuring 27 feet in height andeight across the shoulders were lying overthrown, while others still standing appeared much larger. One of the latter wasso lofty that the shade was sufficient to shelter a party of thirty persons from the heat of the sun. The platforms on whichthese colossal images stood averaged from thirty to forty feet in length, twelve to sixteen broad. . . . all built of hewn stonein the Cyclopean style, very much like the walls of the Temple of Pachacamac, or the ruins of Tia-Huanuco in Peru\" (vol.iii., pp. 310, 311).\"THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE STATUES HAVE BEEN BUILT UP, BIT BY BIT, BYSCAFFOLDING ERECTED AROUND THEM\" -- adds the journal very suggestively -- without explaining how they couldbe built otherwise, unless made by giants of the same size as the statues themselves. One of the best of these colossalimages is now in the British Museum. The images at Ronororaka -- the only ones now found erect -- are four in number,three deeply sunk in the soil, and one resting on the back of its head like the head of a man asleep. Their types, thoughall are long-headed, are different; and they are evidently meant for portraits, as the noses, the mouths and chins differgreatly in form, their head-dress, moreover -- a kind of flat cap with a back piece attached to it to cover the back portion ofthe head --showing that the originals were no savages of the stone period. Verily the question may be asked -- \"Whomade them?\" -- but it is not archaeology nor yet geology that is likely to answer, though the latter recognizes in the Islanda portion of a submerged continent.But who cut the Bamian, still more colossal, statues, the tallest and the most gigantic in the whole world, for Bartholdi's\"Statue of Liberty\" (now at New York) is a dwarf when compared with the largest of the five images. Burnes, and severallearned Jesuits who have visited the place, speak of a mountain \"all honeycombed with gigantic cells,\" with two immensegiants cut in the same rock. They are referred to as the modern Miaotse (vide supra, quotation from Shoo-King) the lastsurviving witnesses of the Miaotse who had \"troubled the earth\"; the Jesuits are right, and the Archaeologists, who seeBuddhas in the largest of these statues, are mistaken. For all those numberless gigantic ruins discovered one after theother in our day, all those immense avenues of colossal ruins that cross North America along and beyond the RockyMountains, are the work of the Cyclopes, the true and actual Giants of old. \"Masses of enormous human bones\" werefound \"in America, near Misorte,\" a celebrated modern traveller tells us, precisely on the spot which local tradition pointsout as the landing------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 338 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.spot of those giants who overran America when it had hardly arisen from the waters (See \"De La Vega,\" Vol. ix., ch. ix.).*Central Asian traditions say the same of the Bamian statues. What are they, and what is the place where they have stoodfor countless ages, defying the cataclysms around them, and even the hand of man, as in the instance of the hordes ofTimoor and the Vandal-warriors of Nadir-Shah? Bamian is a small, miserable, half-ruined town in Central Asia, half-waybetween Cabul and Balkh, at the foot of Kobhibaba, a huge mountain of the Paropamisian (or Hindu-Kush) chain, some8,500 feet above the level of the sea. In days of old, Bamian was a portion of the ancient city of Djooljool, ruined anddestroyed to the last stone by Tchengis-Khan in the XIIIth century. The whole valley is hemmed in by colossal rocks,which are full of partially natural and partially artificial caves and grottoes, once the dwellings of Buddhist monks who hadestablished in them their viharas. Such viharas are to be met with in profusion, to this day, in the rock-cut temples of Indiaand the valleys of Jellalabad. It is at the entrance of some of these that five enormous statues, of what is regarded asBuddha, have been discovered or rather rediscovered in our century, as the famous Chinese traveller, Hiouen-Thsang,speaks of, and saw them, when he visited Bamian in the VIIth century."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"When it is maintained that no larger statues exist on the whole globe, the fact is easily proven on the evidence of all thetravellers who have examined them and taken their measurements. Thus, the largest is 173 feet high, or seventy feethigher than the \"Statue of Liberty\" now at New York, as the latter is only 105 feet or 34 metres high. The famousColossus of Rhodes itself, between whose limbs passed easily the largest vessels of those days, measured only 120 to130 feet in height. The second statue, cut out in the rock like the first one, is only 120 feet (15 feet taller than the said\"Liberty\").** The third statue is only 60 feet high -- the two others still smaller, the last one being only a little larger thanthe average tall man of our present race.

The primitive idea was due to esoteric allegory. The unnaturally large earssymbolize the omniscience of wisdom, and were meant as a reminder of the power of Him who knows and hears all, andwhose benevolent love and attention for all creatures nothing can escape. \"The merciful Lord, our Master, hears the cryof agony of the smallest of the small, beyond vale and mountain, and hastens to its deliverance\":--says a Stanza.Gautama Buddha was an Aryan Hindu, and an approach to such ears is found only among the Mongolian Burmese andSiamese, who, as in Cochin, distort them artificially. The Buddhist monks, who turned the grottos of the Miaotse intoViharas and cells, came into Central Asia about or in the first century of the Christian era. Therefore Hiouen Thsang,speaking of the colossal statue, says that \"the shining of the gold ornamentation that overlaid the statue\" in his day\"dazzled one's eyes,\" but of such gilding there remains not a vestige in modern times. The very drapery, in contrast to thefigure itself, cut out in the standing rock, is made of plaster and modelled over the stone image. Talbot, who has made themost careful examination, found that this drapery belonged to a far later epoch. The statue itself has therefore to beassigned to a far earlier period than Buddhism. Whom does it represent in such case, it may be asked?Once more tradition, corroborated by written records, answers the query, and explains the mystery. The Buddhist Arhatsand Ascetics found the five statues, and many more, now crumbled down to dust, and as the three were found by them incolossal niches at the entrance of their future abode, they covered the figures with plaster, and, over the old, modellednew statues made to represent Lord Tathagata. The interior walls of the niches are covered to this day with brightpaintings of human figures, and the sacred image of Buddha is repeated in every group. These frescoes and ornaments -- which remind one of the Byzantine style of painting -- are all due to the piety of the monk-ascetics, like some other minorfigures and rock-cut ornamentations. But the five statues belong to the handiwork of the Initiates of the Fourth Race, whosought refuge, after the submersion of their continent, in the fastnesses and on the summits of the Central Asianmountain chains. Moreover, the five statues are an imperishable record of the esoteric teaching about the gradualevolution of the races.The largest is made to represent the First Race of mankind, its ethereal body being commemorated in hard, everlastingstone, for the instruction of future generations, as its remembrance would otherwise never have------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 340 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.survived the Atlantean Deluge. The second -- 120 feet high -- represents the sweat-born; and the third -- measuring 60feet -- immortalizes the race that fell, and thereby inaugurated the first physical race, born of father and mother, the lastdescendants of which are represented in the Statues found on Easter Isle; but they were only from 20 to 25 feet in statureat the epoch when Lemuria was submerged, after it had been nearly destroyed by volcanic fires. The Fourth Race wasstill smaller, though gigantic in comparison with our present Fifth Race, and the series culminated finally in the latter. (Seethe following sub-section on \"Cyclopean Ruins, and Colossal Stones as Witnesses to Giants.\")These are, then, the \"Giants\" of antiquity, the ante- and post-diluvian Gibborim of the Bible. They lived and flourished onemillion rather than between three and four thousand years ago. The Anakim of Joshua, whose hosts were as\"grasshoppers\" in comparison with them, are thus a piece of Israelite fancy, unless indeed the people of Israel claim forJoshua an antiquity and origin in the Eocene, or at any rate in the Miocene age, and change the millenniums of theirchronology into millions of years.In everything that pertains to prehistoric times the reader ought to bear the wise words of Montaigne in his mind. Saith thegreat French philosopher:--\" . . . It is a sottish presumption to disdaine and condemne that for false, which unto us seemeth to beare no show oflikelihood or truth: which is an ordinarie fault in those who persuade themselves to be of more sufficiencie than the vulgarsort.\" . . . But reason hath taught me, that so resolutely to condemne a thing for false and impossible, is to assume untohimself the advantage to have the bounds and limits of God's will, and the power of our common Mother Nature tied to hissleeve, and that there is no greater folly in the world than to reduce them to the measure of our capacitie and bounds ofour sufficiencie."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"\"If we term those things monsters or miracles to which our reason cannot attain, how many doe such daily presentthemselves unto our sight?

That finally, \"Christ-stone,\" or Christ-Rock, \"the spiritual Rock\" that followed \"Israel\" (I Corinth. x. 4) \"became aJupiter lapis,\" swallowed by his father Saturn, \"under the shape of a stone.\"* We will not stop to discuss the evidentmisuse and materialization of Biblical metaphors, simply for the sake of proving the Satanism of idols, though a good dealmight be said** on this subject. But without claiming any such peripateticism and innate psychic faculties for our stones,we may collect, in our turn, every available evidence on hand, to show that (a) had there been no giants to move aboutsuch colossal rocks, there could never have been a Stonehenge, a Carnac (Brittany) and other such Cyclopeanstructures; and (b) were there no such thing as MAGIC, there could never have been so many witnesses to oracular andspeaking stones.In the Achaica (p. 81) we find Pausanias confessing that, in beginning his work, he had regarded the Greeks as mightystupid \"for worshipping stones.\" But, having reached Arcadia, he adds: \"I have changed my way of thinking.\" Therefore,without worshipping stones or stone idols and statues, which is the same -- a crime Roman Catholics are unwise toreproach Pagans with, as they do likewise -- one may be allowed to believe in what so many great philosophers and holymen have believed in, without deserving to be called an \"idiot\" by modern Pausaniases.The reader is referred to Volume VI. of the Academie des Inscriptions (Memoires, p. 518, et seq.) if he would study thevarious properties of flints and pebbles from the standpoint of Magic and psychic powers. In a poem on Stones attributedto Orpheus, those stones are divided into ophites and siderites, \"serpent-stones\" and \"star-stones.\" \"The 'Ophite'[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Pierres Animees et parlantes., p. 283.

The latter (Eusebius) neverparted with his ophites, which he carried in his bosom, and received oracles from them, delivered in a small voiceresembling a low whistling.* Arnobius (a holy man who, \"from a Pagan had become one of the lights of the Church,\"Christians tell their readers) confesses he could never meet on his passage with one of such stones without putting itquestions, \"which is answered occasionally in a clear and sharp small voice.\" Where is the difference between theChristian and the Pagan ophites, we ask?It is also known that the famous stone at Westminster was called liafail -- \"the speaking stone,\" -- which raised its voiceonly to name the king that had to be chosen. Cambry (Monuments Celtiques) says he saw it when it still bore theinscription:--**\"Ni fallat fatum, Scoti quocumque locatumInvenient lapidem, regnasse tenentur ibidem.\"Finally, Suidas speaks of a certain Heraclius, who could distinguish at a glance the inanimate stones from those whichwere endowed with motion; and Pliny mentions stones which \"ran away when a hand approached them.\" (SeeDictionnaire des Religions par l'abbe Bertrand; art. on words Heraclius and Betyles.)"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"De Mirville -- who seeks to justify the Bible -- inquires very pertinently, why the monstrous stones of Stonehenge werecalled in days of old chior-gaur (from Cor, \"dance,\" whence chorea, and gaur, a GIANT), or the dance of giants?

I., c. 96), and Apollonius Rhodiusexpatiates on the rocking stones, and says that they are \"stones placed on the apex of a tumulus, and so sensitive as tobe movable by the mind\" (Ackerman's Arth. Index, p. 34), referring no doubt to the ancient priests who moved suchstones by will-power and from a distance.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 343 THE \"ROCKING-STONES\" IN EUROPE.de Cornouailles, sur les traces des giants, and of various learned works on the ruins of Stonehenge,* Carnac and WestHoadley, give far better and more reliable information upon this particular subject. In those regions -- true forests of rocks-- immense monoliths are found, \"some weighing over 500,000 kilograms\" (Cambry). These \"hinging stones\" of SalisburyPlain are believed to be the remains of a Druidical temple. But the Druids were historical men and not Cyclopes, norgiants. Who then, if not giants, could ever raise such masses (especially those at Carnac and West Hoadley), range themin such symmetrical order that they should represent the planisphere, and place them in such wonderful equipoise thatthey seem to hardly touch the ground, are set in motion at the slightest touch of the finger, and would yet resist the effortsof twenty men who should attempt to displace them.We say, that most of these stones are the relics of the last Atlanteans. We shall be answered that all the geologists claimthem to be of a natural origin. That, a rock when \"weathering,\" i.e., losing flake after flake of its substance under influenceof weather, assumes this form. That, the \"tors\" in West England exhibit curious forms, also produced by this cause. That,finally, as all scientists consider the \"rocking stones to be of purely natural origin, wind, rain, etc., causing disintegration ofrocks in layers\" -- our statement will be justly denied, especially as \" we see this process of rock-modification in progressaround us to-day.\" Let us examine the case.But read what Geology has to say, and you will learn that often these gigantic masses do not even belong to thecountries wherein they are now fixed; that their geological congeners often pertain to strata unknown in those regions andto be found only far beyond the seas. Mr. William Tooke (French trans., Sepulture des Tartares. Arch. VII, p. 222),speculating upon the enormous blocks of granite which are strewn over Southern Russia and Siberia, tells the reader thatthere, where they now rest, there are neither rocks nor mountains; and that they must have been brought over \"fromimmense distances and with prodigious efforts.\" Charton (Voyageurs Anciens et Modernes, Vol. I., p. 230) speaks of aspecimen of such rock \"from Ireland,\" which had been submitted to the analysis of an eminent English geologist, whoassigned to it a foreign origin, \"most probably African.\"This is a strange coincidence, as Irish tradition attributes the origin of her circular stones to a Sorcerer who brought themfrom Africa. De Mirville sees in that sorcerer \"an accursed Hamite.\" We see in him a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See, among others, \"History of Paganism in Caledonia,\" by Dr. Th.

Nature alone has accomplished it all (!!) and Science will demonstrate it some day\" (!!) (p. 88).Nevertheless, it is a human, though gigantic power, which has accomplished it, and no more \"nature\" alone than god ordevil.\"Science,\" having undertaken to demonstrate that even the mind and Spirit of man are simply the production of blindforces, is quite capable of accepting the task. It may come out some fine morning, and seek to prove that nature alonehas marshalled the gigantic rocks of Stonehenge, traced their position with mathematical precision, given them the formof the Dendera planisphere and of the signs of the Zodiac, and brought stones weighing over one million of pounds flyingfrom Africa and Asia to England and Ireland!It is true that Cambry recanted later on. \"I had believed for a long time,\" he says, \"that Nature alone could produce thosewonders . . . . but I recant . . . . chance is unable to create such marvellous combinations . . . . and those who placed thesaid rocks in equipoise, are the same who have raised the moving masses of the pond of Huelgoat, near Concarneau. . .. .\" Dr. John Watson, quoted by the same author \"Antiquites Celtiques,\" p. 99, says, when speaking of the moving rocks,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"or Rocking-Stones situated on the slope of Golcar (the \"Enchanter\"): \"The astonishing movement of those masses poisedin equilibrium made the Celts compare them to gods.\" . . . .In \"Stonehenge\" (Flinders Petrie) it is said that \"Stonehenge is built of the stone of the district, a red sandstone, or'sarsen' stone, locally called 'grey wethers.' But some of the stones, especially those which are said to have been devotedto astronomical purposes, have been brought from a distance, probably the North of Ireland.\"To close, the reflections of a man of Science, in an article upon the subject published in 1850 in the Revue Archeologique(p. 473), are worthy of being quoted. Says the paper, concerning the rocking stones:--\"Every stone is a block whose weight would try the most powerful machines. There are, in a word, scattered throughoutthe globe, masses, before which the word materials seems to remain inexplicable, at the sight of which imagination isconfounded, and that had to be endowed with a name as colossal as the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Diodorus Siculus asserts that in the days of Isis, all men were of a vast stature, who were denominated by the HellenesGiants.

Besides which, these immense rocking stones, called sometimes routers -- placed upright on one oftheir sides as on a point, their equipoise being so perfect that the slightest touch is sufficient to set them in motion . . .betray a most positive knowledge of statics. Reciprocal counter-motion, surfaces, plane, convex and concave, in turn . . .all this allies them to Cyclopean monuments, of which it can be said with good reason, repeating after de La Vega that'the demons seem to have worked on them more than men.' \"*For once we agree with our friends and foes, the Roman Catholics, and ask whether such prodigies of statics andequilibrium, applied to masses weighing millions of pounds, can be the work of Palaeolithic savages, of cave-men, tallerthan the average man in our century, yet ordinary mortals as we are? It is no use for our purpose to refer to the varioustraditions attached to the rocking-stones. Still, it may be as well to remind the English reader of Giraldus Cambrensis, whospeaks of such a stone on the Isle of Mona, which returned to its place, every effort made to keep it elsewherenotwithstanding. At the time of the conquest of Ireland by Henry II., a Count Hugo Cestrensis, desiring to convince himselfof the reality of the fact, tied the Mona stone to a far bigger one and had them thrown into the sea. On the followingmorning it was found in its accustomed place. . . The learned William of Salisbury warrants the fact by testifying to itspresence in the wall of a church where he had seen it in 1554. . . And this reminds one of what Pliny said of the stone leftby the Argonauts at Cyzicum, which the Cyzicans had placed in the Prytanea \"whence it ran away several times, whichforced them to lead it\" (Nat. Hist., XXXVI., p. 592) . . . Here we have immense stones stated by all antiquity to be \"living,moving, speaking and self-perambulating.\" They were also capable, it seems, of making people run away, since theyhave been called routers (\"to put to flight,\" to rout) and Des Mousseaux shows them all to be prophetic stones and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"It is difficult,\" writes Creuzer, \"not to suspect in the structures of Tiryns and Mycenae planetary forces supposed to bemoved by celestial powers, analogous to the famous Dactyles.\" (Pelasges et Cyclopes). To this day Science is ignoranton the subject of the Cyclopes. They are supposed to have built all the so-called \"Cyclopean\" works whose erectionnecessitated several regiments of Giants, and -- they were only seventy-seven in all (about one hundred, Creuzer thinks).They are called \"Builders,\" and Occultism calls them the INITIATORS, who, initiating some Pelasgians, thus laid thefoundation stone of true MASONRY. Herodotus associates the Cyclops with Perseus \"the son of an Assyrian demon\" (I.VI. p. 54). Raoul Rochette found that Palaemonius, the Cyclops, to whom a sanctuary was raised, \"was the TyrianHercules.\" Anyhow, he was the builder of the sacred columns of Gadir, covered with mysterious characters to whichApollonius of Tyana was the only one in his age to possess the key; and with figures which may still be found on the wallsof Ellora, the gigantic ruins of the temple of Viswakarma, \"the builder and artificer of the Gods.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 346 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.called mad stones (see his, \"Dieu et les Dieux,\" p. 587). \"The rocking-stone is accepted in Science. Why did it rock, whywas it made to do so? One must be blind not to see that this motion was one more means of divination, and that theywere called for this very reason 'the stones of truth.' \" (de Mirville, \"Fetichisme\")*This is history, the Past of prehistoric times, warranting the same in later ages. The Dracontia, sacred to the moon andthe serpent, were the more ancient \"Rocks of Destiny\" of older nations, whose motion, or rocking, was a code perfectlyclear to the initiated priests, who alone had the key to this ancient reading. Vormius and Olaius Magnus show that it wasaccording to the orders of the oracle, \"whose voice spoke through the immense rocks raised by the colossal powers ofancient giants,\" that the kings of Scandinavia were elected. \"In India and Persia,\" says Pliny, \"it is she (the PersianOitzoe) whom the magi had to consult for the election of their sovereigns\" (Nat. Hist., lxxxvii., chap. LIV.); and hedescribes (in chap. XXXVIII., 1. ii.) a rock overshadowing Harpasa, in Asia, and placed in such a manner that \"a singlefinger[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Messrs. Richardson and Barth are said to have been amazed at finding in the Desert of Sahara the same trilithic andraised stones they had seen in Asia, Circassia, Etruria, and in all the North of Europe. Mr. Rivett-Carnac, B.C.S., ofAllahabad, the distinguished Archaeologist, shows the same amazement in finding the description given by Sir J.Simpson of the cuplike markings on stones and rocks in England, Scotland, and other Western countries -- \"offering anextraordinary resemblance\" to \"the marks on the trap Boulders which encircle the Barrows near Nagpur\" (the city of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Snakes). The eminent scholar saw in this \"another and very extraordinary addition to the mass of evidence. . . that abranch of the nomadic tribes, who swept at an early date over Europe, penetrated into India also.\" We say Lemuria,Atlantis and her giants, and the earliest races of the Fifth Root-Race had all a hand in these betyles, lithoi, and \"magic\"stones in general. The cup marks noticed by Sir J. Simpson, and the \"holes scooped out on the face\" of rocks andmonuments found by Mr. Rivett-Carnac \"of different sizes varying from six inches to an inch-and-a-half in diameter, and indepth from one to one-and-a-half inch . . . . . . generally arranged in perpendicular lines presenting many permutations inthe number and size and arrangement of the cups\" -- are simply written RECORDS of the oldest races. Whosoeverexamines with attention the drawings made of such marks in the \"Archaeological Notes on Ancient Sculpturing on Rocksin Kumaon, India, etc.,\" will find in it the most primitive style of marking or recording; something of the sort having beenadopted by the American inventors of the Morse code of telegraphic writing, which reminds us of the Ahgam writing, acombination of Iong and short strokes, as Mr. Rivett-Carnac describes it \"cut on sandstone.\" Sweden, Norway, andScandinavia are full of such written records, the Runic characters having followed the cup-marks and long and shortstrokes. In \"Johannes Magnus' Infolio\" one sees the representation of the demi-god, the giant Starchaterus (Starkad, thepupil of Kroszharsgrani, the Magician) who holds under each arm a huge stone covered with Runic characters; andStarkad, according to Scandinavian legend, went to Ireland and performed marvellous deeds in the North and South,East and West. (See \"Asgard and the Gods.\")------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 347 UNIVERSAL WITNESSES.can move it, while the weight of the whole body makes it resist.\" Why then should not the rocking stones of Ireland, orthose of Brinham, in Yorkshire, have served for the same mode of divination or oracular communications? The hugest ofthem are evidently the relics of the Atlanteans; the smaller ones, such as Brinham Rocks, with some revolving stones ontheir summit, are copies from the more ancient lithoi. Had not the bishops of the middle ages destroyed all the plans ofthe Dracontia they could lay their hands on, Science would know more of these.* As it is, we know that they wereuniversally used during long prehistoric ages, and all for the same purposes of prophecy and MAGIC. E. Biot, a memberof the Institute of France, published in his Antiquites de France, Vol. ix., an article showing the Chatam peramba (theField of Death, or ancient burial ground in Malabar), to be identical with the old tombs at Carnac -- \"a prominence and acentral tomb.\" . . . \"Bones are found in them (the tombs),\" he says, \"and Mr. Hillwell tells us that some of these areenormous, the natives (of Malabar) calling the tombs the dwellings of Rakshasas (giants).\" Several stone circles,\"considered the work of the Panch Pandava (five Pandus), as all such monuments are in India, so numerous in thatcountry,\" when opened by the direction of Rajah Vasariddi, \"were found to contain human bones of a very large size.\" (T.A. Wise, in \"History of Paganism in Caledonia,\" p. 36).Again, de Mirville is right in his generalization, if not in his conclusions. As the long cherished theory that the Dracontiaare mostly witnesses to \"great natural geological commotions\" (Charlton), and \"are the work of Nature\" (Cambry) is nowexploded, his remarks are very just. \"Before the impossibility of such a theory is asserted, we advise Science to reflect . .. . and, above all, no longer to class Titans and Giants among primitive legends: for their works are there, under our eyes,and those rocking stones will oscillate on their basis to the end of the world to help them to see clearer and realise oncefor all, that one is not altogether a candidate for Charenton for believing in wonders certified to by the whole of Antiquity\"(\"Fetichisme,\" p. 288).It is just what we can never repeat too often, though the voices of both Occultists and Roman Catholics are raised in thedesert. Nevertheless, no one can fail to see that Science is as inconsistent, to say the least, in its modern speculations,as was ancient and mediaeval theology in its interpretations of the so-called Revelation. Science would have mendescend from the pithecoid ape -- a transformation requiring millions of years -- and yet fears to make mankind older than100,000 years! Science teaches the gradual transformation of species,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Charton, the Author of \"Voyageurs anciens et modernes,\" quoted by de Mirville.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 348 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.natural selection and evolution from the lowest form to the highest; from mollusc to fish, from reptile to bird andmammalian. Yet it refuses to man, who physiologically is only a higher mammal and animal, such transformation of hisexternal form. But if the monstrous iguanodon of the Wealden may have been the ancestor of the diminutive iguana of to-day, why could not the monstrous man of the Secret Doctrine have become the modern man -- the link between Animaland Angel? Is there anything more unscientific in this \"theory,\" than in that of refusing to man any spiritual immortal Ego,making of him an automaton, and ranking him, at the same time, as a distinct genus in the system of Nature? OccultSciences may be less scientific than the present exact Sciences, they are withal more logical and consistent in theirteachings. Physical forces, and natural affinities of atoms may be sufficient as factors to transform a plant into an animal;but it requires more than a mere interplay between certain material aggregates and their environment, to call to life a fullyconscious man; even though he were no more indeed than a ramification between two \"poor cousins\" of theQuadrumanous order. Occult Sciences admit with Haeckel that (objective) life on our globe \"is a logical postulate ofScientific natural history,\" but add that the rejection of a like Spiritual involution, from within without, of invisible subjectiveSpirit-life -- eternal and a Principle in Nature -- is more illogical, if possible, than to say that the Universe and all in it hasbeen gradually built by blind forces inherent in matter, without any external help.Suppose an Occultist were to claim that the first grand organ of a cathedral had come originally into being in the followingmanner. First, there was a progressive and gradual elaboration in Space of an organizable material, which resulted in theproduction of a state of matter named organic PROTEIN. Then, under the influence of incident forces, those states havingbeen thrown into a phase of unstable equilibrium, they slowly and majestically evolved into and resulted in newcombinations of carved and polished wood, of brass pins and staples, of leather and ivory, wind-pipes and bellows. Afterwhich, having adapted all its parts into one harmonious and symmetrical machine, the organ suddenly pealed forthMozart's Requiem. This was followed by a Sonata of Beethoven, etc., ad infinitum; its keys playing of themselves and thewind blowing into the pipes by its own inherent force and fancy. . . . .

Then why, in this case, should not historical man be the product of a modification on a pre-existent and pre-historical kind of man, even supposing for argument's sake that there is nothing within him to last longer than, or liveindependently of, his physical structure? But this is not so! For, when we are told that \"organic matters are produced inthe laboratory by what we may literally call artificial evolution\" (Appendix to \"Principles of Biology,\" p. 482), we answer thedistinguished English philosopher, that Alchemists and great adepts have done as much, and, indeed, far more, beforethe chemists ever attempted to \"build out of dissociated elements complex combinations.\" The Homunculi of Paracelsusare a fact in Alchemy, and will become one in Chemistry very likely, and then Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein will have to beregarded as a prophecy. But no chemist, or Alchemist either, will ever endow such a \"Frankenstein's Monster\" with morethan animal instinct, unless indeed he does that which the \"Progenitors\" are credited with, namely, if he leaves his ownphysical body, and incarnates in the \"empty form.\" But even this would be an artificial, not a natural man, for our\"Progenitors\" had, in the course of eternal evolution, to become gods before they became men.The above digression, if one, is an attempt at justification before the few thinking men of the coming century who mayread this. But this accounts also for the reason why the best and most spiritual men of our present day can no longer besatisfied with either Science or theology; and why they prefer any such \"psychic craze\" to the dogmatic assertions of both,neither of the two having anything better to offer than blind faith in their respective infallibility. Universal tradition is indeedthe far safer guide in life. And universal tradition shows primitive man living for ages together with his Creators and firstinstructors -- the Elohim -- in the World's \"Garden of Eden,\" or \"Delight.\" We shall treat of the Divine Instructors in StanzaXII.-------45.

This was when the Fifth Race was in itsinfancy.(b) Thus the giants perished -- the magicians and the sorcerers, adds the fancy of popular tradition, but \"all holy saved,\"and alone the \"unholy were destroyed.\" This was due, however, as much to the prevision of the \"holy\" ones, who had notlost the use of their \"third eye,\" as to Karma and natural law. Speaking of the subsequent race (our Fifth Humanity), thecommentary says:--\"Alone the handful of those Elect, whose divine instructors had gone to inhabit that Sacred Island -- 'from whence the lastSaviour will come' -- now kept mankind from becoming one-half the exterminator of the other [as mankind does now --H.P.B.]. It (mankind) became divided. Two-thirds of it were ruled by Dynasties of lower, material Spirits of the earth, whotook possession of the easily accessible bodies; one-third remained faithful, and joined with the nascent Fifth Race -- thedivine Incarnates. When the Poles moved (for the fourth time) this did not affect those who were protected, and who hadseparated from the Fourth Race. Like the Lemurians -- alone the ungodly Atlanteans perished, and 'were seen no more . .. . .\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 351 THE \"GREAT DRAGONS\" AND SERPENTS.STANZA XII.THE FIFTH RACE AND ITS DIVINE INSTRUCTORS.-------§§ (47) The remnants of the first two races disappear for ever.

History does not begin with it, but living and ever-recurring tradition does.History -- or what is called history -- does not go further back than the fantastic origins of our fifth sub-race, a \"fewthousands\" of years. It is the sub-divisions of this first sub-race of the Fifth Root-Race which are referred to in thesentence, \"Some yellow, some brown and black, and some red, remained.\" The \"moon coloured\" (i.e., the First and theSecond Races) were gone for ever -- ay, without leaving any traces whatever; and that, so far back as the third \"Deluge\"of the Third Lemurian race, that \"Great Dragon,\" whose tail sweeps whole nations out of existence in the twinkling of aneye. And this is the true meaning of the Verse in the COMMENTARY which says:\"The GREAT DRAGON has respect but for the 'SERPENTS' of WISDOM, the Serpents whose holes are now under thetriangular stones,\" i.e., \"the Pyramids, at the four corners of the world.\"(b) This tells us clearly that which is mentioned more than once elsewhere in the Commentaries; namely, that the Adeptsor \"Wise\" men of the three Races (the Third, Fourth and the Fifth) dwelt in subterranean habitats, generally under somekind of pyramidal structure, if not------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 352 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.actually under a pyramid. For such \"pyramids\" existed in the four corners of the world and were never the monopoly ofthe land of the Pharaohs, though until found scattered all over the two Americas, under and over ground, beneath andamidst virgin forests, as in plain and vale, they were supposed to be the exclusive property of Egypt. If the truegeometrically correct pyramids are no longer found in European regions, many of the supposed early neolithic caves, ofthe colossal triangular, pyramidal and conical menhirs in the Morbihan, and Brittany generally; many of the Danish tumuliand even of the \"giant tombs\" of Sardinia with their inseparable companions, the nuraghi, are so many more or lessclumsy copies of the pyramids. Most of these are the works of the first settlers on the newly-born continent and isles ofEurope, the -- \"some yellow, some brown and black, and some red\" -- races that remained after the submersion of thelast Atlantean continents and islands (850,000 years ago), with the exception of Plato's Atlantean island, and before thearrival of the great Aryan races; while others were built by the earliest immigrants from the East. Those who can hardlyaccept the antiquity of the human race so far back as the 57,000 years assigned by Dr. Dowler to the skeleton found byhim at New Orleans on the banks of the Mississippi, will, of course, reject these facts. But they may find themselvesmistaken some day. It is the foolish self-glorification of the Arcadians who styled themselves [[proselenoi]] -- older thanthe moon -- and of the people of Attica, who claimed that they had existed before the sun appeared in heaven, that wemay disparage, not their undeniable antiquity. Nor can we laugh at the universal belief that we had giant ancestors. Thefact that the bones of the mammoth and mastodon, and, in one case, those of a gigantic salamander, have beenmistaken for human bones, does not make away with the difficulty that, of all the mammalians, man is the only one whomscience will not allow to have dwarfed down, like all other animal frames, from the giant homo diluvii to the creaturebetween 5 and 6 feet that he is now.But the \"Serpents of Wisdom\" have preserved their records well, and the history of the human evolution is traced inheaven as it is traced on underground walls. Humanity and the stars are bound together indissolubly, because of theintelligences that rule the latter.Modern symbologists may scoff at this and call it \"fancy,\" but \"it is unquestionable that the Deluge has (ever) beenassociated in the legends of some Eastern peoples not only with the Pyramids, but also with the constellations,\" writesMr. Staniland Wake (\"The Great Pyramid\"). The \"Old Dragon\" is identical with the \"great Flood,\" says Mr. Proctor (in\"Knowledge,\" Vol. I., p. 243): \"We know that in the past the constellation of the Dragon was at the pole, or boss, of thecelestial sphere. In stellar temples . . . the Dragon would be the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 353 THE ASTRONOMICAL DRAGON.uppermost or ruling constellation . . . it is singular how closely the constellations . . . correspond in sequence and in rangeof right ascension with the events recorded respecting the (Biblical) Flood.\"The reasons for this singularity have been made clear in this work. But it shows only that there were several Delugesmixed up in the memories and traditions of the sub-races of the Fifth Race. The first great \"Flood\" was astronomical andcosmical, while several others were terrestrial. Yet, this did not prevent our very learned friend Mr. Gerald Massey -- anInitiate truly in the mysteries of the British Museum, still only a Self-initiate -- from declaring and insisting that theAtlantean submersion and Deluge were only the anthropomorphized fancies of ignorant people; and that Atlantis was nobetter than an astronomical allegory. Nevertheless, the great Zodiacal allegory is based upon historical events, and onecan hardly interfere with the other; and it stands also to reason that every student of Occultism knows what thatastronomical and zodiacal allegory means. Smith shows in the Nimrod Epic of the Assyrian tablets the real meaning of it.Its \"twelve cantos\" refer to the \"annual course of the Sun through the twelve months of the year. Each tablet answers to aspecial month, and contains a distinct reference to the animal forms in the signs of the Zodiac\"; the eleventh canto being\"consecrated to Rimmon, the God of storms and of rain, and harmonizes with the eleventh sign of the Zodiac -- Aquarius,or the Waterman\" (Nineteenth Century, 1882, p. 236). But even this is preceded in the old records by the pre-astronomical Cosmic FLOOD, which became allegorized and symbolized in the above Zodiacal or Noah's Flood. But this"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"has nothing to do with Atlantis. The Pyramids are closely connected with the ideas of both the Great Dragon (theconstellation), the \"Dragons of Wisdom,\" or the great Initiates of the Third and Fourth Races, and the Floods of the Nile,regarded as a divine reminder of the great Atlantic Flood. The astronomical records of Universal History, however, aresaid to have had their beginnings with the Third Sub-race of the Fourth Root-race or the Atlanteans. When was it? Occultdata show that even since the time of the regular establishment of the Zodiacal calculations in Egypt, the poles havebeen thrice inverted. We will presently return once more to this statement. Such symbols as are represented by the Signs of the Zodiac -- afact which offers a handle to materialists upon which to hang their one-sided theories and opinions -- have too profound asignification, and their bearing upon our Humanity is too important to suffer dismissal in a few words. Meanwhile, we haveto consider the meaning of that other statement which mentions (verse 48) the first divine Kings, who are said to have\"redescended,\" guided and instructed our Fifth Race after the last deluge!------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 354 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.We shall consider this last claim historically in the sections that follow, but must end with a few more details on thesubject of \"Serpents.\"The rough commentaries on the Archaic Stanzas have to end here. Further elucidation requires proofs obtained fromancient, mediaeval, and modern works that have treated of these subjects. All such evidence has now to be gathered in,collated and brought together in better order, so as to compel the attention of the reader to this wealth of historical proofs.And as the manifold meaning of the weird symbol -- so often referred to and suggestive of the \"tempter of man\" in theorthodox light of the church -- can never be too strongly insisted upon, it seems more advisable to exhaust the subject byevery available proof at this juncture, even at the risk of repetition. The Titans and Kabirs have been invariably made outby our theologians and some pious symbologists as indissolubly connected with the grotesque personage called devil,and every proof to the contrary has been hitherto as invariably rejected and ignored; therefore, the occultist must neglectnothing which may tend to defeat this conspiracy of slander. It is proposed to divide the subjects involved in these threelast verses into several groups, and examine them in this final chapter as carefully and as fully as space permits. A fewmore details may thus be added to the general evidences of antiquity, on the most disputed tenets of Occultism and theEsoteric Doctrine -- the bulk of which will be found in Part II. on Symbology.-------SERPENTS AND DRAGONS UNDER DIFFERENT SYMBOLISMS.The name of the Dragon in Chaldea was not written phonetically, but was represented by two monograms, probablymeaning, according to the Orientalists, \"the scaly one.\" \"This description,\" very pertinently remarks G. Smith, \"of coursemight apply either to a fabulous dragon, a serpent, or a fish,\" and we may add: \"It applies in one case to Makara, thetenth Zodiacal sign, meaning in Sanskrit a non-descript amphibious animal, generally called Crocodile, and reallysignifying something else. (Vide Part II., \"The Mysteries of the Hebdomad.\") This, then, is a virtual admission that theAssyriologists, at all events, know nothing certain as to the status of the \"Dragon\" in ancient Chaldea, whence theHebrews got their symbolism, only to be afterwards robbed of it by the Christians, who made of the \"Scaly one\" a livingentity and a maleficent power.A specimen of Dragons, \"winged and scaled,\" may be seen in the British Museum. Representing the events of the Fallaccording to the same authority, there are also two figures sitting on each side of a tree, and holding out their hands tothe \"apple,\" while at the back of the \"Tree\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 355 THE NAASENIAN GNOSTICS.is the Dragon-Serpent. Esoterically, the two figures are two \"Chaldees\" ready for initiation, the Serpent symbolising the\"Initiator\"; while the jealous gods, who curse the three, are the exoteric profane clergy. Not much of the literal \"Biblicalevent\" there, as any occultist can see.\"The Great Dragon has respect but for the Serpents of Wisdom,\" says the Stanza; thus proving the correctness of ourexplanation of the two figures and the \"Serpent.\"\"The Serpents who redescended . . . . who taught and instructed\" the Fifth Race. What sane man is capable of believingin our day that real serpents are hereby meant? Hence the rough guess, now become almost an axiom with the men ofscience, that those who wrote in antiquity upon various sacred Dragons and Serpents either were superstitious andcredulous people, or were bent upon deceiving those more ignorant than themselves. Yet, from Homer downwards, theterm implied something hidden from the profane.\"Terrible are the gods when they manifest themselves\" -- those gods whom men call Dragons. And AElianus, treating inhis \"De Natura Animalium\" of these Ophidean symbols, makes certain remarks which show that he understood well thenature of this most ancient of symbols. Thus he most pertinently explains with regard to the above Homeric verse -- \"Forthe Dragon, while sacred and to be worshipped, has within himself something still more of the divine nature of which it isbetter (for others?) to remain in ignorance\" (Book xi., ch. 17).This \"Dragon\" having a septenary meaning, the highest and the lowest may be given. The former is identical with the\"Self-born,\" the Logos (the Hindu Aja). He was the second person of the Trinity, the SON, with the Christian Gnosticscalled the Naasenians, or Serpent-Worshippers. His symbol was the constellation of the Dragon.* Its seven \"stars\" arethe seven stars held in the hand of the \"Alpha and Omega\" in Revelation. In its most terrestrial meaning, the term\"Dragon\" was applied to the Wise men.This portion of the religious symbolism of antiquity is very abstruse and mysterious, and may remain incomprehensible tothe profane.

Emphatically we answer -- No. His \"Dragon\" is Neptune, thesymbol of Atlantean magic.To demonstrate the negation the reader is asked to examine the symbolism of the Serpent or the Dragon under itsseveral aspects.-------THE SIDEREAL AND COSMIC GLYPHS.Every astronomer -- besides Occultists and Astrologers -- knows that, figuratively, the astral light, the milky way, and alsothe path of the Sun to the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, as well as the circles of the Sidereal or Tropical year, werealways called \"Serpents\" in the allegorical and mystic phraseology of the adepts.This, cosmically, as well as metaphorically. Poseidon is a \"Dragon\": \"Chozzar, called by the profane Neptune\" (PerataeGnostics); the \"Good and Perfect Serpent,\" the Messiah of the Naaseni, whose symbol in Heaven is Draco.But one ought to discriminate between the characters of this symbol. For instance: Zoroastrian Esotericism is identicalwith that of the Secret Doctrine; and when, as an example, we read in the Vendidad complaints uttered against the\"Serpent,\" whose bites have transformed the beautiful, eternal spring of Airyana-Vaego, changing it into winter,generating disease and death, at the same time as mental and psychic consumption, every occultist knows that theSerpent alluded to is the north pole, as also the pole of the heavens.* The latter produces the seasons according to theangle at which it penetrates the centre of the earth. The two axes were no more parallel; hence the eternal spring ofAiryana Vaego by the good river Daitya had disappeared, and \"the Aryan Magi had to emigrate to Sagdiani\" -- say theexoteric accounts. But the esoteric teaching states that the pole had passed through the equator, and that the \"land ofbliss\" of the Fourth Race, its inheritance from the Third, had now become the region of desolation and woe. This aloneought to be an incontrovertible proof of the great antiquity of the Zoroastrian Scriptures. The Neo-Aryans of the post-diluvian age could, of course, hardly recognise the mountains, on the summits of which their forefathers had met beforethe Flood, and conversed with the pure \"Yazathas\" (celestial Spirits of the Elements), whose life and food they had onceshared. As shown by Eckstein (Revue Archeologique, 8th year, 1885), \"the Vendidad seems to point out a great changein the atmosphere of central Asia; strong volcanic eruptions and the collapse of a whole range of mountains in theneighbourhood of the Kara-Korum chain.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Symbolized by the Egyptians under the form of a Serpent with a hawk's head.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 357 THE TWO MYSTIC POLES.The Egyptians, according to Eusebius, who for once (and for a wonder) wrote the truth, symbolised Kosmos by a largefiery circle, representing a serpent with a hawk's head lying across its diameter. \"Here we have the pole of the earthwithin the plane of the ecliptic, attended with all the fiery consequences that must arise from such a state of the heavens:when the whole Zodiac in 25,000 (odd) years, must have reddened with the solar blaze, and each sign must have beenvertical to the polar region.\" (See Mackey's \"Sphinxiad.\")Meru -- the abode of the gods -- was placed, as before explained, in the North Pole, while Patala, the nether region, wassupposed to lie in the South. As each symbol in esoteric philosophy has seven keys, geographically, Meru and Patalahave one significance and represent localities; while astronomically, they have another, and mean \"the two poles,\" whichmeanings ended by their being often rendered in exoteric sectarianism -- the \"Mountain\" and the \"Pit,\" or Heaven andHell. If we hold at present only to the astronomical and geographical significance, it may be found that the ancients knewthe topography and nature of the Arctic and Antarctic regions better than any of our modern astronomers; they hadreasons, and good ones for naming one the \"Mountain\" and the other the \"Pit.\" As the author just quoted half explains,Helion and Acheron meant nearly the same: \"Heli-on is the Sun in the highest\" (Helios, Heli-on, the \"most high\"); \"andAcheron is 32 deg. above the pole, and 32 below it, the allegorical river being thus supposed to touch the northernhorizon in the latitude of 32 degrees. The vast concave, that is for ever hidden from our sight and which surrounded thesouthern pole, being therefore called the PIT, while observing, toward the Northern pole that a certain circuit in theheavens always appeared above the horizon -- they called it the Mountain. As Meru is the high abode of the Gods, thesewere said to ascend and descend periodically; by which (astronomically) the Zodiacal gods were meant, the passing ofthe original North Pole of the Earth to the South Pole of the heaven.\" \"In that age,\" adds the author of that curious work,the \"Sphinxiad\" and of \"Urania's Key to the Revelations\" -- \"at noon, the ecliptic would be parallel with the meridian, andpart of the Zodiac would descend from the North Pole to the north horizon; crossing the eight coils of the Serpent (eightsidereal years, or over 200,000 solar years), which would seem like an imaginary ladder with eight staves reaching fromthe earth up to the pole, i.e., the throne of Jove. Up this ladder, then, the Gods, i.e., the signs of the Zodiac, ascended"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"and descended. (Jacob's ladder and the angels) . . . . It is more than 400,000 years since the Zodiac formed the sides ofthis ladder.\" . . . .This is an ingenious explanation, even if it is not altogether free from occult heresy. Yet it is nearer the truth than many ofa more scientific------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 358 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and especially theological character. As just said, the Christian trinity was purely astronomical from its beginning, whichmade Rutilius say -- of those who euhemerized it -- \"Judaea gens, radix stultorum.\"But the profane, and especially the Christian fanatics, ever in search of scientific corroboration for their dead-letter texts,will persist in seeing in the celestial pole the true Serpent of Genesis, Satan, the Enemy of mankind, instead of what it is -- a cosmic metaphor. When the gods are said to forsake the earth, it does not only mean the gods, protectors andinstructors, but also the minor gods -- the regents of the Zodiacal signs. Yet, the former, as actual and existing Entitieswhich gave birth to, nursed, and instructed mankind in its early youth, appear in every Scripture, in that of theZoroastrians as much as in the Hindu Gospels. Ormazd, or Ahura-Mazda, the \"Lord of Wisdom,\" is the synthesis of theAmshaspends (or Amesha-Spenta -- \"Immortal Benefactors\"),* the \"Word,\" however, or the Logos and its six highestaspects in Mazdyanism. These \"Immortal Benefactors\" are described in Zamyad yasht as the \"Amesha-Spentas, theshining, having efficacious eyes, great, helpful . . . . imperishable and pure which are all seven of like mind, like speech,all seven doing alike . . . . which are the creators and destroyers of the creatures of Ahura-Mazda, their creators andoverseers, their protectors and rulers . . . .\"These few lines alone indicate the dual and even the triple character of the Amshaspends, our Dhyan-Chohans or the\"Serpents of Wisdom.\" They are identical with, and yet separate from Ormazd (Ahura-Mazda). They are also the Angelsof the Stars of the Christians -- the Stary-azatas of the Zoroastrians -- or again the seven planets (including the sun) ofevery religion.** The epithet -- \"the shining having efficacious eyes\" -- proves it. This on the physical and sidereal planes.On the spiritual, they are the divine powers of Ahura-Mazda; but on the astral or psychic plane again, they are the\"Builders,\" the \"watchers,\" the Pitar (fathers), and the first Preceptors of mankind.When mortals shall have become sufficiently spiritualised, there will be no more need of forcing them into a correctcomprehension of ancient Wisdom. Men will know then, that there never yet was a great World-reformer, whose namehas passed into our generation, who (a) was not a direct emanation of the LOGOS (under whatever name known to us),i.e., an essential incarnation of one of \"the seven,\" of the \"divine Spirit who is sevenfold\"; and (b) who had not appearedbefore, during the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Also translated as \"blissful Immortals\" by Dr. W. Geiger; but the first is more correct.** These \"seven\" became the eight, the Ogdoad, of the later materialized religions, the seventh, or the highest principle,being no longer the pervading Spirit, the Synthesis, but becoming an anthropomorphic number, or additional unit.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 359 GOD AND NATURE ANTHROPOMORPHIZED.past Cycles. They will recognise, then, the cause which produces in history and chronology certain riddles of the ages;the reason why, for instance, it is impossible for them to assign any reliable date to Zoroaster, who is found multiplied bytwelve and fourteen in the Dabistan; why the Rishis and Manus are so mixed up in their numbers and individualities; whyKrishna and Buddha speak of themselves as re-incarnations, i.e., Krishna is identified with the Rishi Narayana, andGautama gives a series of his previous births; and why the former, especially, being \"the very supreme Brahma,\" is yetcalled Amsamsavatara -- \"a part of a part\" only of the Supreme on Earth. Finally, why Osiris is a great God, and at thesame time a \"prince on Earth,\" who reappears in Thoth-Hermes, and why Jesus (in Hebrew, Joshua) of Nazareth isrecognised, cabalistically, in Joshua, the Son of Nun, as well as in other personages. The esoteric doctrine explains it bysaying that each of these (as many others) had first appeared on earth as one of the seven powers of the LOGOS,individualized as a God or \"Angel\" (messenger); then, mixed with matter, they had re-appeared in turn as great sages andinstructors who \"taught the Fifth Race,\" after having instructed the two preceding races, had ruled during the DivineDynasties, and had finally sacrificed themselves, to be reborn under various circumstances for the good of mankind, andfor its salvation at certain critical periods; until in their last incarnations they had become truly only \"the parts of a part\" onearth, though de facto the One Supreme in Nature.This is the metaphysics of Theogony. And, as every \"Power\" among the SEVEN has (once individualized) in his chargeone of the elements of creation, and rules over it,* hence the many meanings in every symbol, which, unless interpretedaccording to the esoteric methods, generally lead to an inextricable confusion.Does the Western Kabalist -- generally an opponent of the Eastern Occultist -- require a proof? Let him open EliphasLevi's Histoire de la Magic,\" p. 53, and carefully examine his \"Grand Symbole Kabalistique\" of the Zohar. He will find, onthe engraving given, a white man standing erect and a black woman upside down, i.e., standing on her head, her legspassing under the extended arms of the male figure, and protruding behind his shoulders, while their hands join at anangle on each side. Eliphas Levi makes of it, God and Nature; or God, \"light,\" mirrored inversely in \"Nature and Matter,\"darkness. Kabalistically and symbolically he is right; but only so far as emblematical cosmogony goes. Nor has heinvented the symbol any more[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* These elements are:-- The cosmic, the terrene, the mineral, the vegetable, the animal, the aqueous, and finally thehuman -- in their physical, spiritual, and psychic aspects."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 360 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.than the Kabalists have: the two figures in white and black stone have existed in the temples of Egypt from timeimmemorial -- agreeably to tradition; and historically -- ever since the day of King Cambyses, who personally saw them.Therefore the symbol must have been in existence since nearly 2,500 years ago. This, at the very least, for that Persiansovereign, who was a son of Cyrus the Great, succeeded his father in the year 529 B.C. These figures were the twoKabiri personifying the opposite poles. Herodotus (Thalia, No. 77) tells posterity that when Cambyses entered the templeof the Kabirim, he went into an inextinguishable fit of laughter, on perceiving what he thought a man erect and a womanstanding on the top of her head before him. These were the poles, however, whose symbol was intended tocommemorate \"the passing of the original North Pole of the Earth to the South Pole of the Heaven,\" as perceived byMackey.* But they represented also the poles inverted, in consequence of the great inclination of the axis, bringing eachtime as a result the displacement of the Oceans, the submersion of the polar lands, and the consequent upheaval of newcontinents in the equatorial regions, and vice versa. These Kabirim were the \"Deluge\" gods.This may help us to get at the key of the seemingly hopeless confusion among the numbers of names and titles given toone and the same gods, and classes of gods. Faber showed already, at the beginning of this century, the identity of theCorybantes, Curetes, Dioscuri, Anactes, Dii Magni, Idei Dactyli, Lares, Penates, Manes,** Titans, and Aletae with theKABIRI. And we have shown that the latter were the same as the Manus, the Rishis and our Dhyan Chohans, whoincarnated in the Elect of the Third and Fourth Races. Thus, while in Theogony the Kabiri-Titans were seven great gods:cosmically and astronomically the Titans were called Atlantes, because, perhaps, as Faber says, they were connected[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Who adds that the Egyptians had various ways of representing the angles of the Poles. Also in Perry's View of theLevant there is \"a figure representing the South Pole of the Earth in the constellation of the Harp,\" in which the polesappear like two straight rods, surmounted with hawks' wings, but they were also often represented as serpents withheads of hawks, one at each end.** Faber and Bishop Cumberland would make them all the later pagan personifications, as the former writer has it, of \"theNoetic Ark, and no other than the Patriarch (Noah) and his family\" (!) See his \"Kabiri,\" Vol. I., 136; because, we are told,\"after the Deluge in commemoration of the event, the pious Noachidae had established a religious festival, which was,later on, corrupted by their impious descendants; demons or hero-gods; and at length unblushing obscenity usurped thename and garb of religion\" (Vol. I., p. 10.). Now this is indeed putting an extinguisher upon the human reasoning powers,not only of antiquity, but even of our present generations. Reverse the statement, and explain after the words \"Noah andhis family\" that what is meant by that patriarch and family is simply the Jewish version of a Samothracian mystery, ofSaturn, or Kronos-Sadic and his Sons, and then we may say Amen.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 361 WHO WERE ENOCH AND THE OTHERS?(a) with At-al-as \"the divine Sun,\" and (b) with tit \"the deluge.\" But this, if true, is only the exoteric version. Esoterically, themeaning of their symbols depends on the appellation, or title, used. The seven mysterious, awe-inspiring great gods -- theDioscuri,* the deities surrounded with the darkness of occult nature -- become the Idei (or Idaeic finger) with the adept-healer by metals. The true etymology of the name lares (now signifying \"ghosts\") must be sought in the Etruscan word\"lars,\" \"conductor,\" \"leader.\" Sanchoniathon translates the word Aletae as fire worshippers, and Tabor believes it derivedfrom Al-Orit, \"the god of fire.\" Both are right, as in both cases it is a reference to the Sun (the highest God), toward whomthe planetary gods \"gravitate\" (astronomically and allegorically) and whom they worship. As Lares, they are truly the SolarDeities, though Faber's etymology, who says that \"lar\" is a contraction of \"El-Ar,\" the solar deity, is not very correct. Theyare the \"lares,\" the conductors and leaders of men. As Aletae, they were the seven planets -- astronomically; and asLares, the regents of the same, our protectors and rulers -- mystically. For purposes of exoteric or phallic worship, as alsocosmically, they were the Kabiri, their attributes being recognised in these two capacities by the name of the temples towhich they respectively belonged, and those of their priests. They all belonged, however, to the Septenary creative andinforming groups of Dhyan Chohans. The Sabeans, who worshipped the \"regents of the Seven planets\" as the Hindus dotheir Rishis, held Seth and his son Hermes (Enoch or Enos) as the highest among the planetary gods. Seth and Enoswere borrowed from the Sabeans and then disfigured by the Jews (exoterically); but the truth can still be traced aboutthem even in Genesis.** Seth is the \"progenitor\" of those early men of the Third Race in whom the \"Planetary\" angels hadincarnated -- a Dhyan Chohan himself, who belonged to the informing gods; and Enos (Hanoch or Enoch) or Hermes,was said to be his son -- because it was a generic name for all the early Seers (\"Enoichion\"). Thence the worship. TheArabic writer Soyuti says that the earliest records mention Seth, or Set, as the founder of Sabeanism; and therefore thatthe pyramids which embody the planetary system were regarded as the place of sepulchre of both Seth and Idris(Hermes or Enoch), (See Vyse, \"Operations,\" Vol. II., p. 358); that thither Sabeans proceeded[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Who became later on, with the Greeks, limited only to Castor and Pollux.

While the latter maintains \"that each pyramid was consecrated to a star\" (a starregent rather), Abd Allatif assures us \"that he had read in Sabean books that one pyramid was the tomb ofAgathodaemon and the other of Hermes\" (Vyse, Vol. II., p. 342). \"Agathodaemon was none other than Seth, and,according to some writers, Hermes was his son,\" adds Mr. Staniland Wake in \"The Great Pyramid,\" p. 57.Thus, while in Samothrace and the oldest Egyptian temples they were the great Cosmic Gods (the seven and the forty-nine Sacred Fires), in the Grecian fanes their rites became mostly phallic, therefore to the profane, obscene. In the lattercase they were 3 and 4, or 7 -- the male and female principles -- (the crux ansata); this division showing why someclassical writers held that they were only three, while others named four. And these were -- the Kabiri -- Axieros (in hisfemale aspect, Demeter); Axio-Kersa (Persephone)*; Axiokersos (Pluto or Hades); and Kadmos or Kadmilos (Hermes --not the ithyphallic Hermes mentioned by Herodotus (II. 51) but \"he of the sacred legend,\" explained only during theSamothracian mysteries). This identification, due, according to the Scholiast Apollon (Rh. I. 217), to an indiscretion ofMnaseas, is none at all, as names alone do not reveal much. There were still others again who maintained, being as rightin their way, that there were only two Kabiri. These were, esoterically, the two Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, andexoterically, Jupiter and Bacchus. The two personified the terrestrial poles, geodesically; the terrestrial, and the pole ofthe heavens -- astronomically, as also the physical and the spiritual man. The story of Semele and Jupiter and the birth ofBacchus, the Bimater, with all the circumstances attending it, needs only to be read esoterically to understand theallegory. The parts played in the event by the fire, water, earth, etc., in the many versions, will show how \"the father of thegods\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is a curious idea -- yet one not very far from the truth, perhaps -- that speculation of Mackey, the self-made Adept ofNorwich, found in his \"Mythological Astronomy.\" He says that the Kabiri named Axieros and Axiokersa derived theirnames (a) from Kab or Cab, a measure, and from Urim, the heavens: the Kabirim being thus \"a measure of the heavens\";and (b) that their distinctive names, implying the principle of generation, referred to the sexes. For, \"the word sex wasformerly understood by aix; which has now settled . . . . into sex.\" And he refers to \"Encyclopaedia Londinus\" at the word\"aspiration.\" Now if we give the aspirated sound to Axieros, it would be Saxieros; and the other pole would be Saxiokersa.The two poles would thus become the generators of the other powers of nature -- they would be the parents: therefore themost powerful gods.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 363 THE POLES, THE \"HEAVENLY MEASURE.\"and the \"merry God of the wine\" were also made to personify the two terrestrial Poles. The telluric, metalline, magnetic,electric and the fiery elements are all so many allusions and references to the cosmic and astronomic character of thediluvian tragedy. In astronomy, the poles are indeed the \"heavenly measure\" (vide note supra); and so are the KabiriDioscuri, as will be shown, and the Kabiri-Titans, to whom Diodorus ascribes the invention of fire* and the art ofmanufacturing iron. Moreover, Pausanias shows that the original Kabiric deity was Prometheus. (I. ix. p. 751.)But the fact that, astronomically, the Titans-Kabirim were also the generators and regulators of the seasons, andcosmically the great Volcanic Energies, the gods presiding over all the metals and terrestrial works, does not preventthem from being, in their original divine characters, the beneficent Entities who, symbolized in Prometheus, brought lightto the world, and endowed humanity with intellect and reason. They are pre-eminently in every theogony -- especially inthe Hindu -- the sacred divine fires, 3, 7, or 49, according as the allegory demands it. Their very names prove it, as theyare the Agni-putra (Sons of the Fire) in India, and the genii of the fire under numerous names in Greece and elsewhere.Welcker, Maury, and now Decharme, show the name Kabeiron meaning \"the powerful through fire,\" from the Greek word[[kaio]] \"to burn.\" The Semitic Kabirim, \"the powerful, the mighty, and the great,\" answering to the Greek [[megaloidunatoi]], are later epithets. They were universally worshipped, and their origin is lost in the night of time. Yet whetherpropitiated in Phrygia, Phoenicia, the Troad, Thrace, Egypt, Lemnos or Sicily, their cult was always connected with fire;their temples ever built in the most volcanic localities, and in exoteric worship they belonged to Chthonian divinities.Therefore Christianity has made of them infernal gods.They are truly \"the great, beneficent and powerful Gods,\" as Cassius Hermone calls them (See Macrob. Sat. I., iii., c. 4, p.376). At Thebes, Kore and Demeter, the Kabirim, had a sanctuary (Pausan. IX. 22; 5), and at Memphis, the Kabiri had atemple so sacred, that none, excepting the priests, were suffered to enter their holy precincts (Herodotus I. ii., c. 37). Butwe must not lose sight, at the same time, of the fact that the title of Kabiri was a generic one; that the Kabiri (the mightygods as well as mortals), were of both sexes, as also terrestrial, celestial and kosmic. That, while in their later capacity ofthe Rulers of sidereal and terrestrial powers, a purely geological phenomenon (as it is now[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The word \"guebra\" comes from Kabiri, gabiri, and means Persian ancient fire-worshippers, or Parsis.

Thus the Kabiri are said to haveappeared as the benefactors of men, and as such they lived for ages in the memory of nations. To them -- the Kabiri orTitans -- is ascribed the invention of letters (the Devanagari, or the alphabet and language of the gods), of laws andlegislature; of architecture, as of the various modes of magic, so-called; and of the medical use of plants. Hermes,Orpheus, Cadmus, Asclepius, all those demi-gods and heroes, to whom is ascribed the revelation of sciences to men,and in whom Bryant, Faber, Bishop Cumberland, and so many other Christian writers -- too zealous for plain truth --wouldforce posterity to see only pagan copies of one and sole prototype, named Noah -- are all generic names."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"It is the Kabiri who are credited with having revealed, by producing corn or wheat, the great boon of agriculture.

The two serpents, entwined around the rod, are phallic symbols ofJupiter and other gods who transformed themselves into snakes for purposes of seducing goddesses -- but only in theunclean fancies of profane symbologists. The serpent has ever been the symbol of the adept, and of his powers ofimmortality and divine knowledge. Mercury in his psychopompic character, conducting and guiding with the caduceus thesouls of the dead to Hades and even raising the dead to life with it, is simply a very transparent allegory. It shows the dualpower of the Secret Wisdom: the black and the white magic. It shows this personified Wisdom guiding the Soul afterdeath, and its power to call to life that which is dead -- a very deep metaphor if one thinks over its meaning. Every peopleof antiquity reverenced this symbol, with the exception of Christians, who chose to forget the brazen Serpent of Moses,and even the implied acknowledgment of the great wisdom and prudence of the Serpent by Jesus himself, \"Be ye wise asserpents and harmless as doves.\" The Chinese, one of the oldest nations of our Fifth Race, made of it the emblem oftheir Emperors, who are thus the degenerate successors of the \"Serpents\" or Initiates, who ruled the early races of theFifth Humanity.

The aphorisms in the oldest books of China, moreover, say plainly that the \"Dragon\" is a human, albeit divine,Being. Speaking of the \"Yellow Dragon,\" the chief of the others, the Twan-ying-t'u, says: \"His wisdom and virtue areunfathomable . . . he does not go in company and does not live in herds (he is an ascetic). He wanders in the wildsbeyond the heavens. He goes and comes, fulfilling the decree (Karma); at the proper seasons if there is perfection hecomes forth, if not he remains (invisible).\". . . And Kon-fu-tyu is made to say by Lu-lan, \"The Dragon feeds in the purewater of Wisdom and sports in the clear waters of Life.\"-------OUR DIVINE INSTRUCTORS.Now Atlantis and the Phlegyan isle are not the only record that is left of the deluge. China has also her tradition and thestory of an island or continent, which it calls Ma-li-ga-si-ma, and which Kaempfer and Faber spell \"Maurigosima,\" forsome mysterious phonetic reasons of their own. Kaempfer, in his \"Japan\" (Appendix, p. 13), gives the tradition: Theisland, owing to the iniquity of its giants, sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and Peiru-un, the king, the Chinese Noah,escapes alone with his family owing to a warning of the gods through two idols. It is that pious prince and hisdescendants who have peopled China. The Chinese traditions speak of the divine dynasties of Kings as much as those ofany other nations.At the same time there is not an old fragment but shows belief in a multiform and even multigeneric evolution -- spiritual,psychic, intellectual and physical -- of human beings, just as given in the present work. A few of these claims have now tobe considered.Our races -- they all show -- have sprung from divine races, by whatever name they are called. Whether we deal with theIndian Rishis or Pitris; with the Chinese Chim-nang and Tchan-gy -- their \"divine man\" and demi-gods; with the AkkadianDingir and Mul-lil -- the creative god and the \"Gods of the ghost-world\"; with the Egyptian Isis-Osiris and Thot; with theHebrew Elohim, or again with Manco Capac and his Peruvian progeny -- the story varies nowhere. Every nation hasAmshaspends* (six exoterically), ten and seven Chaldean Anedots,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Amshaspends are six -- if Ormazd, their chief and Logos, is excluded. But in the secret doctrine he is the seventhand highest, just as Phtah is the seventh Kabir among the Kabiri.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 366 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.ten and seven Sephiroth, etc., etc. One and all have been derived from the primitive Dhyan-Chohans of the Esotericdoctrine, or the \"Builders\" of the Stanzas (Book I.). From Manu, Thot-Hermes, Oannes-Dagon, and Edris-Enoch, down toPlato and Panadores, all tell us of seven divine Dynasties, of seven Lemurian, and seven Atlantean divisions of the Earth;of the seven primitive and dual gods who descend from their celestial abode* and reign on Earth, teaching mankindAstronomy, Architecture, and all the other sciences that have come down to us. These Beings appear first as \"gods\" andCreators; then they merge in nascent man, to finally emerge as \"divine-Kings and Rulers.\" But this fact has beengradually forgotten. As Bosuage shows, the Egyptians themselves confessed that science flourished in their country onlysince Isis-Osiris, whom they continue to adore as gods, \"though they had become Princes in human form.\" And he addsof Osiris-Isis (the divine androgyne:-- \"It is said that this Prince (Isis-Osiris) built cities in Egypt, stopped the overflowing ofthe Nile; invented agriculture, the use of the vine, music, astronomy, and geometry.\"When Abul-Feda says in his \"Historia Anteislamitica\" (Fleisher, p. 16) that the Sabean language was established by Sethand Edris (Enoch) -- he means by \"Sabean language\" astronomy. In the \"Melelwa Nohil\" (MS. 47 in Nic. Cat.) Hermes iscalled the disciple of Agathodaemon. And in another account (See Col. Vyse's 2nd Vol. of the \"Pyramids of Ghizeh,\" p.364, MS. 785, Uri's Cat.) Agathodaemon is mentioned as a \"King of Egypt.\" Celepas Geraldinus gives curious traditionsabout Henoch. He calls him the \"divine giant.\" In the \"Book of the various names of the Nile,\" the same author (thehistorian Ahmed-Ben-Yusouf Eltiphas) tells us of the belief among the Semitic Arabs that Seth (become later the EgyptianTyphon, Set), had been one of the seven angels (or Patriarchs in the Bible): then he became a mortal and Adam's son,after which he communicated the gift of prophecy and astronomical science to Jared, who passed it to his son Henoch.But Henoch (Idris) \"the author of thirty books, was Sabaean by origin\" (i.e., belonging to the Saba, \"a Host\"); \"having"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"established the rites and ceremonies of primitive worship, he went to the East, where he constructed 140 cities, of whichEdessa was the least important, then returned to Egypt where he became its King.\" Thus, he is identified with Hermes.But there were five Hermes -- or rather one, who appeared -- as some Manus and Rishis did -- in several differentcharacters. In the Burham-i-Kati he is mentioned as \"Hormig,\" a name of the planet Mercury or Budha; and Wednes-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the Purana it is identified with Vishnu's or Brahma's Sveta Dwipa of Mount Meru.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 367 HERMES IN ASTRONOMY AND ELSEWHERE.day was sacred both to Hermes and Thot. The Hermes of Oriental tradition, worshipped at Phineata and said to have fledafter the death of Argus into Egypt, civilized it under the name of Thoth. But under whichever of these characters, he isalways credited with having transferred all the sciences from latent to active potency, i.e., with having been the first toteach magic to Egypt and to Greece, before the days of Magna Graecia, and when the Greeks were not even Hellenes.Not only Herodotus -- the \"father of History\" -- tells us of the marvellous dynasties of gods that preceded the reign ofmortals, followed by the dynasties of demi-gods, Heroes, and finally men, but the whole series of classics support him;Diodorus, Eratosthenes, Plato, Manetho, etc., etc., repeat the same, and never vary the order given.\"It is, indeed,\" as Creuzer shows:--\"From the spheres of the stars wherein dwell the gods of light that wisdom descends to the inferior spheres.\" \"In thesystem of the ancient priests (Hierophants and Adepts) all things without exception, gods, the genii, manes (souls), thewhole world, are conjointly developed in Space and duration. The pyramid may be considered as the symbol of thismagnificent hierarchy of Spirits. . . . \"*There were more efforts made by the modern historians (French Academicians, like Renan, chiefly) to suppress truth byignoring the ancient annals of divine Kings, than is strictly consistent with honesty. But M. Renan could never be moreunwilling than was Eratosthenes 260 years B.C. to accept the unpalatable fact; and yet the latter found himself obliged torecognise its truth. For this, the great astronomer is treated with great contempt by his colleagues 2,000 years later.Manetho became with them \"a superstitious priest born and bred in the atmosphere of other lying priests of Heliopolis\"(Freret). \"All those historians and priests,\" justly remarks the demonologist, de Mirville, \"so veracious when repeatingstories of human kings and men, suddenly become extremely suspicious no sooner do they go back to their gods.\" . . .But there is the synchronistic table of Abydos, which, thanks to the genius of Champollion, has now vindicated the goodfaith of the priests of Egypt (Manetho's above all), and that of Ptolemy. In the Turin papyrus, the most remarkable of all, inthe words of the Egyptologist, de Rouge:--\". . . Champollion, struck with amazement, found that he had under his own eyes the whole truth. . . . It was the remainsof a list of dynasties embracing the furthest mythoic times, or the REIGN OF THE GODS AND HEROES. . . .

The chronology of the divine Kings and Dynasties, like that of the age of humanity, hasever been in the hands of the priests, and was kept secret from the profane multitudes.Africa, as a continent, it is said, appeared before Europe did; nevertheless it appeared later than Lemuria and even theearliest Atlantis. That the whole region of what is now Egypt and the deserts was once upon a time covered with the sea,was known firstly through Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, and all the Greeks; and, secondly, through geology. Abyssinia wasonce upon a time an island; and the Delta was the first country occupied by the pioneer emigrants who came with theirgods from the North-east.When was it? History is silent upon the subject. Fortunately we have the Dendera Zodiac, the planisphere on the ceilingof one of the oldest Egyptian temples, which records the fact. This Zodiac, with its mysterious three Virgos between theLion and Libra, has found its OEdipus, who understood the riddle of these signs, and justified the truthfulness of thosepriests who told Herodotus that:-- (a) The poles of the Earth and the Ecliptic had formerly coincided; and (b) That evensince their first Zodiacal records were commenced, the Poles have been three times within the plane of the Ecliptic, asthe Initiates taught.Bailly had not sufficient words at his command to express his surprise at the sameness of all such traditions about thedivine races. \"What are finally,\" he exclaims, \"all those reigns of Indian Devas and Persian Peris? . . . . Or, those reignsand dynasties of the Chinese legends; those Tien-hoang or the Kings of Heaven, quite distinct from the Ti-hoang, theKings on Earth, and the Gin-hoang the King's men, a distinction which is in perfect accord with that other one made bythe Greeks and the Egyptians, in enumerating their dynasties of Gods, of demi-gods, and of mortals.\"*"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"\"Now,\" says Panadoras, \"it is before that time (Menes), that the reign of the seven gods who rule the world took place.

These statues, he says, were enormouscolossi in wood, three hundred and forty-five in number, each of which had his name, his history and his annals. And theyassured Herodotus* (unless the most truthful of historians, the \"Father of History,\" is now accused of fibbing, just in thisinstance) that no historian could ever understand or write an account of these superhuman Kings, unless he had studiedand learned the history of the three dynasties that preceded the human -- namely, the DYNASTIES OF THE GODS, thatof demi-gods, and of the Heroes, or giants. These \"three dynasties\" are the three Races.**Translated into the language of the Esoteric doctrine, these three dynasties would also be those of the Devas, ofKimpurushas, and of Danavas and Daityas -- otherwise gods, celestial spirits, and giants or Titans. \"Happy are those whoare born, even from the condition of gods, as men, in Bharata-Varsha!\" exclaim the incarnated gods themselves, duringthe Third Root-Race. Bharata is India, but in this case it symbolized the chosen land in those days, and was consideredthe best of the divisions of Jambu-dwipa, as it was the land of active (spiritual) works par excellence; the land of initiationand of divine knowledge.Can one fail to recognise in Creuzer great powers of intuition, when, being almost unacquainted with the Aryan Hinduphilosophies, little known in his day, he wrote:--\"We modern Europeans feel surprised when hearing talk of the Spirits of the Sun, Moon, etc. But we repeat again, thenatural good sense and the upright[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See also Memoires a l'Academie, etc., of de Mirville, Vol. III., for a mass of evidence.** In Vishnu-Purana, Book II., chap. 3, 4, et seq., may be found many corroborations of the same, if one reads carefully.The reigns of gods, lower gods, and men are all enumerated in the descriptions of the seven Islands, seven seas, sevenmountains, etc., etc., ruled by Kings. Each king is said invariably to have seven sons, an allusion to the seven sub-races.One instance will do. The King of Kusa dwipa had seven sons (follow names) . . . \"after whom the seven portions(Varsha) of the island were called. There reside mankind along with Daityas and Danavas, as well as with spirits ofHeaven (Gandharvas, Yakshas, Kimpurushas, etc.) and gods.\" (Chapter iv.) There is but one exception in the case ofKing Priyavrata, the son of the first Manu, Swayambhuva -- who had ten sons. But of these, three -- Medha, Agnibahu,and Putra -- became ascetics, and refused their portions. Thus Priyavrata divided the earth again into seven continents.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 370 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.judgment of the ancient peoples, quite foreign to our entirely material ideas upon celestial mechanics and physicalsciences . . . could not see in the stars and planets only that which we see: namely, simple masses of light, or opaquebodies moving in circuits in sidereal space, merely according to the laws of attraction or repulsion; but they saw in themliving bodies, animated by spirits as they saw the same in every kingdom of nature. . . .

Without such a psychological link, and thefeeling of its presence, no science can ever progress, and the realm of knowledge must be limited to the analysis ofphysical matter only.Occultists believe in \"spirits,\" because they feel (and some see) themselves surrounded on every side by them.*Materialists do not. They live on this earth, just as, in the world of insects and even of fishes, some creatures livesurrounded by myriads of their own genus, without seeing, or so much as sensing them.**Plato is the first sage among the classics who speaks at length of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* As a general rule, now that the very nature of the inner man has become as blind as his physical nature, man is situatedon this globe as the Amphioxus is in the Ocean.

Who knows whether, on the Darwinian theory, these \"Branchiostoma\" are not the direct ancestors of ourMaterialists.** The Occultists have been accused of worshipping gods or devils. We deny this.

This learned Jesuit writes in\"OEdipus AEgyptiacus\" (Vol. I., p. 70):--\"I confess, for a long time I had regarded all this (dynasties and the Atlantis) as pure fables (meras nugas) to the daywhen, better instructed in Oriental languages, I judged that all those legends must be, after all, only the development of agreat truth. . . . .\"As de Rougemont shows, Theopompus, in his Meropis, made the priests of Phrygia and Asia Minor speak exactly as thepriests of Sais did when they revealed to Solon the history and fate of Atlantis. According to Theopompus, it was a uniquecontinent of an indefinite size, and containing two countries inhabited by two races -- a fighting, warrior race, and a pious,meditative race,* which Theopompus symbolizes by two cities.** The pious \"city\" was continually visited by the gods; thebelligerent \"city\" was inhabited by various beings invulnerable to iron, liable to be mortally wounded only by stone andwood.\"*** De Rougemont treats this as a pure fiction of Theopompus (\"Peuple Primitif,\" vol. iii. 157) and even sees afraud (supercherie) in the assertion of the Saitic priests. This was denounced by the \"Demonologists\" as illogical. In thewords of De Mirville:-- \"A supercherie which was based on a belief, the product of faith of the whole antiquity; asupposition which yet gave its name to a whole mountain chain (the Atlas); which specified with the greatest precision atopographical region (by placing some of its lands at a small distance from Cadiz and the strait of Calpetus), whichprophesied, 2,000 years before Columbus, the great trans-oceanic land situated beyond that Atlantis and which \"isreached\" it said -- \"by the islands not of the blessed, but of the good spirits [[eudaimonia]] (our 'Iles Fortunees') -- such asupposition can never be an universal chimera.\" (A word on \"Atlantis,\" p. 29.)It is certain that, whether \"chimera\" or reality, the priests of the whole world had it from one and the same source: theuniversal tradition[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] modern Charcots to pay attention to the delirium of their patients from a morepsychic standpoint, Science, and physiology especially, might be more benefited than they are now, and truth have awider field of fact in its knowledge.* These were the early Aryans and the bulk of the Fourth Root Races -- the former pious and meditative (yoga-contemplation), the latter -- a fighting race of sorcerers, who were rapidly degenerating owing to their uncontrolledpassions.** The Northern and Southern Divisions of Lemuria-Atlantis.

According to Plato, in order to obtain clear and precise ideas on royalty, itsorigin and power, one has to turn back to the first principles of history and tradition. Great changes, he says, haveoccurred in days of old, in heaven and on earth, and the present state of things is one of the results (Karma). Ourtraditions tell us of many marvels, of changes that have taken place in the course of the Sun, of Saturn's reign, and of athousand other matters that remained scattered about in human memory; but one never hears anything of the EVIL whichhas[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The first continent, or island, if so preferred, \"the cap of the North Pole,\" has never perished; nor will it to the end of theSeven Races.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 373 WHEAT BROUGHT DOWN BY THE GODS.produced those revolutions, nor of the evil which directly followed them. Yet . . . . that Evil is the principle one has to talkabout, to be able to treat of royalty and the origin of power. . . .\"That evil, Plato seems to see in the sameness or consubstantiality of the natures of the rulers and the ruled, for he saysthat long before man built his cities, in the golden age, there was naught but happiness on earth, for there were no needs.Why? Because Saturn, knowing that man could not rule man, without injustice filling forthwith the universe through hiswhims and vanity, would not allow any mortal to obtain power over his fellow creatures. To do this the god used the samemeans we use ourselves with regard to our flocks. We do not place a bullock or a ram over our bullocks and rams, butgive them a leader, a shepherd, i.e., a being of a species quite different from their own and of a superior nature. It is justwhat Saturn did. He loved mankind and placed to rule over it no mortal King or prince but -- \"Spirits and genii [[daimones]]of a divine nature more excellent than that of man.\"It was god, the Logos (the synthesis of the Host) who thus presiding over the genii, became the first shepherd and leaderof men.* When the world had ceased to be so governed and the gods retired, \"ferocious beasts devoured a portion ofmankind.\" \"Left to their own resources and industry, inventors then appeared among them successively and discoveredfire, wheat, wine; and public gratitude deified them . . . .\"(\"De Legibus\" 1, iv.; in Crit. and in Politic).And mankind was right, as fire by friction was the first mystery of nature, the first and chief property of matter that wasrevealed to man.\"Fruits and grain, unknown to Earth to that day, were brought by the 'Lords of Wisdom' for the benefit of those they ruled -- from other lokas (spheres). . . \" say the Commentaries. Now: \"The earliest inventions (?) of mankind are the mostwonderful that the race has ever made. . . The first use of fire, and the discovery of the methods by which it can bekindled; the domestication of animals; and, above all, the processes by which the various cereals were first developed outof some wild grasses (?) -- these are all discoveries with which, in ingenuity and in importance, no subsequentdiscoveries may compare. They are all unknown to history -- all lost in the light of an EFFULGENT DAWN.\" (\"Unity ofNature,\" Argyll.)This will be doubted and denied in our proud generation. But if it is asserted that there are no grains and fruits unknownto earth, then we may remind the reader that wheat has never been found in the wild state: it is not a product of the earth.All the other cereals have been traced to their primogenital forms in various species of wild grasses, but wheat has[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Secret Doctrine explains and expounds that which Plato says, for it teaches that those \"inventors\" were gods anddemi-gods (Devas and Rishis) who had become -- some deliberately, some forced to by Karma -- incarnated in man.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 374 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.hitherto defied the efforts of botanists to trace it to its origin. And let us bear in mind, in this connection, how sacred wasthat cereal with the Egyptian priests; wheat being placed even with their mummies, and found thousands of years later intheir coffins. Remember:-- \"The servants of Horus glean the wheat in the field of Aanroo. . . . wheat seven cubits high.\"(\"Book of the Dead,\" chap. xcix., 33; and clvi., 4.)* The reader is referred to Stanza VII., Verse 3, Book I., wherein thisverse is explained in another of its meanings, and also to the \"Book of the Dead,\" chap. cix., v. 4 and 5.\"I am the Queen of these regions,\" says the Egyptian Isis; \"I was the first to reveal to mortals the mysteries of wheat andcorn. . . . I am she who rises in the constellation of the dog . . . (Dog-star) . . . . Rejoice, O Egypt! thou who wert mynurse.\" (Book I., chap. XIV.**Sirius was called the dog-star. It was the star of Mercury or Budha, called the great instructor of mankind, before otherBuddhas.The book of the Chinese Y-King, attributes the discovery of agriculture to \"the instruction given to men by celestial genii.\"\"Woe, woe to the men who know nought, observe nought, nor will they see. . . .

The legend whichinscribes the third Registrar of the papyrus (Chap. cx. of the \"Book of the Dead\") states: \"This is the region of the Manes(disembodied men) seven cubits high -- to wit: those just translated and supposed to be still sevenfold with all theirprinciples, even the body represented astrally in the Kama-loka or Hades, before their separation . . . . . \" and, there iswheat three cubits high for mummies in a state of perfection\" (i.e., those already separated, whose three higher principlesare in Devachan \"who are permitted to glean it.\" This region (Devachan) is called \"the land of the re-birth of gods,\" andshown to be inhabited by Scheo, Tefnant, and Seb. The \"region for the manes seven cubits high,\" (for the yet imperfectmummies), and the region for those \"in a state of perfection\" who \"glean wheat three cubits high,\" is as clear as possible.The Egyptians had the same esoteric philosophy which is now taught by the cis-Himalayan adepts, who, when buried,have corn and wheat placed over them.** There are Egyptologists who have tried to identify Osiris with Menes, which is quite erroneous. Bunsen assigns toMenes an antiquity of 5867 years B.C., and is denounced for it by Christians.

Of what value is independent criticism so called, or \"internalevidence\" (based usually on the respective hobbies of the critics), in the face of the universal testimony, which nevervaried throughout the historical cycles? Read esoterically the sixth chapter of Genesis, which repeats the statements ofthe Secret Doctrine, only changing slightly its form, and drawing a different conclusion which clashes even with the Zohar.\"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that when 'the Sons of God' (b'ne-aleim) \"came in unto thedaughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown\" (orgiants).*What does this sentence \"and also after that\" signify unless it means when explained: \"There were giants in the earthBEFORE, i.e., before the sinless sons of the Third Race; and also after that when other sons of God, lower in nature,inaugurated sexual connection on earth (as Daksha did, when he saw that his Manasaputras would not people theearth)\"? And then comes a long break in this chapter vi. of Genesis, between verses 4 and 5. For surely, it was not in orthrough the wickedness of the \"mighty men\" . . . . men of renown, among whom is placed Nimrod the \"mighty hunterbefore the Lord,\" that \"god saw that the wickedness of man was great,\" nor in the builders of Babel, for this was after theDeluge; but in the progeny of the giants who produced monstra quaedam de genere giganteo, monsters from whencesprang the lower races of men, now represented on earth by a few miserable dying-out tribes and the huge anthropoidapes.And if we are taken to task by theologians, whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, we have only to refer them to their ownliteral texts. The above quoted verse was ever a dilemma, not alone for the men of science and Biblical scholars, but alsofor priests. For, as the Rev. Father Peronne puts it:-- \"Either they (the B'ne-aleim) were good angels, and in such casehow could they fall? Or they were bad (angels) and in this case could not be called b'ne-aleim, the \"sons of God.\"(Praelectiones theol. ch. ii.) This Biblical riddle -- \"the real sense of which no author has ever understood,\" as candidlyconfessed by Fourmont** -- can only be explained by the Occult doctrine, through the Zohar to the Western, and the Bookof Dzyan to the Eastern. What the former says we have seen; what the Zohar tells us is this: B'ne-aleim was a namecommon to the Malachim (the good Messengers) and to the Ischin (\"the lower angels\") (Rabbi Parcha).We may add for the benefit of the demonologists that their Satan,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Genesis vi., v. 4.** Reflections critiques sur l'origine des anciens peuples.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 376 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"the adversary,\" is included in Job among the sons of God or b'ne-aleim who visit their father.\" (Chapter i.) But of this lateron.Now the Zohar says that the Ischin, the beautiful B'ne-aleim, were not guilty, but mixed themselves with mortal menbecause they were sent on earth to do so. (Book of Ruth and Schadash; fol. 63, col. 3; Amsterdam edition). Elsewherethe same volume shows these b'ne-aleim belonging to the tenth sub-division of the \"Thrones\" (Zohar, part iii., col. 113.But see also 1st vol. 184). It also explains that the Ischin, \"men-spirits,\" viri spirituales, now that men can see them nolonger, help magicians to produce, through their science, homunculi which are not small men but \"men smaller (in thesense of inferiority) than men.\" Both show themselves under the form that the Ischin had then, i.e., gaseous and ethereal.Their chief is Azazel.But Azazel, whom the Church dogma will associate with Satan, is nothing of the kind. Azazel is a mystery, as explainedelsewhere, and it is so expressed in Maimonides, \"In More Nevochim\" (chapter xxvi., p. 8). \"There is an impenetrablemystery in the narrative concerning Azazel.\" And so there is, as Lanci, a librarian to the Vatican and one who ought toknow, says -- we have quoted him before -- that \"this venerable divine name (nome divino e venerabile) has become"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"through the pen of Biblical scholars, a devil, a wilderness, a mountain, and a he-goat\" (Sagra Scrittura). Therefore itseems foolish to derive the name as Spencer does, from Ajal (separated) and El (god), hence \"one separated from God,\"the DEVIL. In the Zohar, Azazel is rather the Sacrificial victim than the \"formal adversary of Jehovah,\" as Spencer wouldhave it (II., pp. 14, 29).The amount of malicious fancy and fiction bestowed on that \"Host\" by various fanatical writers is quite extraordinary.Azazel and his \"host\" are simply the Hebrew \"Prometheus,\" and ought to be viewed from the same standpoint. The Zoharshows the Ischin chained on the mountain in the desert, allegorically; thus simply alluding to those \"spirits\" as beingchained to the earth during the cycle of incarnation. Azazel (or Azaziel) is one of the chiefs of the \"transgressing\" angelsin Enoch, who descending upon Ardis, the top of Mount Armon, bound themselves by swearing loyalty to each other. It issaid that Azaziel taught men to make swords, knives, shields, to fabricate mirrors (?) to make one see what is behind him(viz., \"magic mirrors\"). Amazarak taught all the sorcerers and dividers of roots; Amers taught the solution of magic;Barkayal, astrology; Akibeel, the meaning of portents and signs; Tamial, astronomy; and Asaradel taught the motion ofthe moon. \"These seven were the first instructors of the Fourth man\" (i.e., of the Fourth Race). But why should allegorybe always understood as meaning all that its dead-letter expresses?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 377 THE FALLACIES OF THE TWO CHURCHES.It is the symbolical representation of the great struggle between divine wisdom, nous, and its earthly reflection, Psuche, orbetween Spirit and Soul, in Heaven and on Earth. In Heaven --because the divine MONAD had voluntarily exiled itselftherefrom, to descend, for incarnating purposes, to a lower plane and thus transform the animal of clay into an immortalgod. For, as Eliphas Levi tells us, \"the angels aspire to become men; for the perfect man, the man-god, is above evenangels.\" On Earth -- because no sooner had Spirit descended than it was strangled in the coils of matter.Strange to say, the Occult teaching reverses the characters; it is the anthropomorphous archangel with the Christians,and the man-like God with the Hindus, which represent matter in this case; and the Dragon, or Serpent, Spirit. Occultsymbolism furnishes the key to the mystery; theological symbolics conceal it still more. For the former explains many asaying in the Bible and even in the New Testament which have hitherto remained incomprehensible; while the latter,owing to its dogma of Satan and his rebellion, has belittled the character and nature of its would-be infinite, absolutelyperfect god, and created the greatest evil and curse on earth -- belief in a personal Devil. This mystery is opened with thekey to its metaphysical symbolism now restored; while that of theological interpretation shows the gods and thearchangels standing as symbols for the dead letter or dogmatic religions, and as arrayed against the pure truths of Spirit,naked and unadorned with fancy.Many were the hints thrown out in this direction in \"Isis Unveiled,\" and a still greater number of references to this mysterymay be found scattered throughout these volumes. To make the point clear once for all: that which the clergy of everydogmatic religion -- pre-eminently the Christian -- points out as Satan, the enemy of God, is in reality, the highest divineSpirit -- (occult Wisdom on Earth) -- in its naturally antagonistic character to every worldly, evanescent illusion, dogmaticor ecclesiastical religions included. Thus, the Latin Church, intolerant, bigoted and cruel to all who do not choose to be itsslaves; the Church which calls itself the bride of Christ, and the trustee at the same time of Peter, to whom the rebuke ofthe Master \"get thee behind me Satan\" was justly addressed; and again the Protestant Church which, while calling itselfChristian, paradoxically replaces the New Dispensation by the old \"Law of Moses\" which Christ openly repudiated: boththese Churches are fighting against divine Truth, when repudiating and slandering the Dragon of esoteric (becausedivine) Wisdom. Whenever anathematizing the Gnostic Solar Chnouphis -- the Agathodaemon -- Christos, or thetheosophical Serpent of Eternity, or even the Serpent of Genesis -- they------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 378 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.are moved by the same Spirit of dark fanaticism that moved the Pharisees to curse Jesus by saying to him \"Say we notwell thou hast a devil?\"Read the account about Indra (Vayu) in the Rig-Veda, the occult volume par excellence of Aryanism, and then compare itwith the same in the Puranas -- the exoteric version thereof, and the purposely garbled account of the true Wisdomreligion. In the Rig Veda Indra is the highest and greatest of the Gods, and his Soma-drinking is allegorical of his highlyspiritual nature. In the Puranas Indra becomes a profligate, and a regular drunkard on the Soma juice, in the terrestrialway. He is the conqueror of all the \"enemies of the gods\" -- the Daityas, Nagas (Serpents), Asuras, all the Serpent-gods,and of Vritri, the Cosmic Serpent. Indra is the St. Michael of the Hindu Pantheon -- the chief of the militant Host. Turningto the Bible, we find Satan, one of the \"Sons of God\" (Job. i. 6), becoming in exoteric interpretation the Devil, and theDragon in its infernal, evil sense. But in the Kabala (\"Book of Numbers\") Samael, who is Satan, is shown to be identicalwith St. Michael, the slayer of the Dragon. How is this? For it is said that Tselem (the image) reflects alike Michael andSamael who are one. Both proceed, it is taught, from Ruach (Spirit), Neschamah (Soul) and Nephesch (life). In the\"Chaldean Book of Numbers\" Samael is the concealed (occult) Wisdom, and Michael the higher terrestrial Wisdom, bothemanating from the same source but diverging after their issue from the mundane soul, which on Earth is Mahat(intellectual understanding, or Manas (the seat of Intellect). They diverge, because one (Michael) is influenced byNeschamah, while the other (Samael) remains uninfluenced. This tenet was perverted by the dogmatic spirit of theChurch; which, loathing independent Spirit, uninfluenced by the external form (hence by dogma), forthwith made ofSamael-Satan (the most wise and spiritual spirit of all) -- the adversary of its anthropomorphic God and sensual physicalman, the DEVIL!--------THE ORIGIN OF THE SATANIC MYTH.Let us then fathom this creation of the Patristic fancy still deeper, and find its prototype with the Pagans. The origin of thenew Satanic myth is easy to trace. The tradition of the Dragon and the Sun is echoed in every part of the world, both in itscivilized and semi-savage regions. It took rise in the whisperings about secret initiations among the profane, and was"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"established universally through the once universal heliolatrous religion. There was a time when the four parts of the worldwere covered with the temples sacred to the Sun and the Dragon;------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 379 THE SECRET OF THE DRAGON.but the cult is now preserved mostly in China and the Buddhist countries, \"Bel and the Dragon being uniformly coupledtogether, and the priest of the Ophite religion as uniformly assuming the name of his God\" (\"Archaeology,\" Vol. xxv., p.220, London). In the religions of the past, it is in Egypt we have to seek for its Western origin. The Ophites adopted theirrites from Hermes Trismegistus, and heliolatrous worship crossed over with its Sun-gods into the land of the Pharaohsfrom India. In the gods of Stonehenge we recognise the divinities of Delphi and Babylon, and in those of the latter thedevas of the Vedic nations. Bel and the Dragon, Apollo and Python, Krishna and Kaliya, Osiris and Typhon are all oneunder many names -- the latest of which are Michael and the Red Dragon, and St. George and his Dragon. As Michael is\"one as God,\" or his \"Double,\" for terrestrial purposes, and is one of the Elohim, the fighting angel, he is thus simply apermutation of Jehovah. Whatever the Cosmic or astronomical event that first gave rise to the allegory of the \"War ofHeaven,\" its earthly origin has to be sought in the temples of Initiation and archaic crypts. The following are the proofs:--We find (a) the priests assuming the name of the gods they served; (b) the \"Dragons\" held throughout all antiquity as thesymbols of Immortality and Wisdom, of secret Knowledge and of Eternity; and (c) the hierophants of Egypt, of Babylon,and India, styling themselves generally the \"Sons of the Dragon\" and \"Serpents\"; thus the teachings of the SecretDoctrine are thereby corroborated.There were numerous catacombs in Egypt and Chaldea, some of them of a very vast extent. The most renowned of themwere the subterranean crypts of Thebes and Memphis. The former, beginning on the western side of the Nile, extendedtowards the Lybian desert, and were known as the Serpent's catacombs, or passages. It was there that were performedthe sacred mysteries of the kuklos anagkes, the \"Unavoidable Cycle,\" more generally known as \"the circle of necessity\";the inexorable doom imposed upon every soul after the bodily death, and when it has been judged in the Amenthianregion.In de Bourbourg's book, Votan, the Mexican demi-god, in narrating his expedition, describes a subterranean passagewhich ran underground, and terminated at the root of the heavens, adding that this passage was a snake's hole, \"unagujero de colubra\"; and that he was admitted to it because he was himself \"a son of the snakes,\" or a serpent. (\"DiePhoinizier,\" 70.)This is, indeed, very suggestive; for his description of the snake's hole is that of the ancient Egyptian crypt, as abovementioned. The hierophants, moreover, of Egypt, as of Babylon, generally styled them-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 380 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.selves the \"Sons of the Serpent-god,\" or \"Sons of the Dragon,\" during the mysteries.\"The Assyrian priest bore always the name of his god,\" says Movers. The Druids of the Celto-Britannic regions also calledthemselves snakes. \"I am a Serpent, I am a Druid,\" they exclaimed. The Egyptian Karnak is twin brother to the Carnac ofBretagne, the latter Carnac meaning the serpent's mount. The Dracontia once covered the surface of the globe, andthese temples were sacred to the Dragon, only because it was the symbol of the sun, which, in its turn, was the symbol ofthe highest god -- the Phoenician Elon or Elion, whom Abraham recognised as El Elion.* Besides the surname ofserpents, they were called the \"builders,\" the \"architects\"; for the immense grandeur of their temples and monuments wassuch that even now the pulverised remains of them \"frighten the mathematical calculations of our modern engineers,\"says Taliesin.**De Bourbourg hints that the chiefs of the name of Votan, the Quetzo-Cohuatl, or Serpent deity of the Mexicans, are thedescendants of Ham and Canaan. \"I am Hivim,\" they say. \"Being a Hivim, I am of the great race of the Dragon (snake). Iam a snake myself, for I am a Hivim.\" (\"Cartas,\" 51; \"Isis Unveiled,\" Vol. I., 553, et seq.)Furthermore, the \"War in Heaven\" is shown, in one of its significations, to have meant and referred to those terriblestruggles in store for the candidate for adeptship, between himself and his (by magic) personified human passions, whenthe inner enlightened man had to either slay them or fail. In the former case he became the \"Dragon-Slayer,\" as havinghappily overcome all the temptations; and a \"Son of the Serpent\" and a Serpent himself, having cast off his old skin andbeing born in a new body, becoming a Son of Wisdom and Immortality in Eternity. (See Part II. on the Satanic Myth.)Seth, the reputed forefather of Israel, is only a Jewish travesty of Hermes, the God of Wisdom, called also Thoth, Tat,Seth, Set, and Satan. He is also Typhon -- the same as Apophis, the Dragon slain by Horus; for Typhon was also calledSet. He is simply the dark side of Osiris, his brother, as Angra Mainyu is the black shadow of Ahura-mazda. Terrestrially,all these allegories were connected with the trials of adeptship and initiation. Astronomically, they referred to the Solarand Lunar eclipses, the mythical explanations of which we find to this day in India and Ceylon, where any one can studythe allegorical narratives and traditions which have remained unchanged for many thousands of years.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Sanchoniathon in \"Eusebius,\" Pr.

The Sun and Moon, who had detected him in his theft, denounced him to Vishnu, who placedhim in the stellar spheres, the upper portion of his body representing the Dragon's head and the lower (Ketu) the Dragon'stail; the two being the ascending and descending nodes. Since then, Rahu wreaks his vengeance on the Sun and Moonby occasionally swallowing them. But this fable had another mystic meaning, since Rahu, the Dragon's head, played aprominent part in the mysteries of the Sun's (Vikarttana's) initiation, when the candidate and the Dragon had a supremefight.The caves of the Rishis, the abodes of Tiresias and the Greek seers, were modelled on those of the Nagas -- the HinduKing-Snakes, who dwelled in cavities of the rocks under the ground. From Sesha, the thousand-headed Serpent, onwhich Vishnu rests, down to Python, the dragon serpent oracle, all point to the secret meaning of the myth. In India wefind the fact mentioned in the earliest Puranas. The children of Surasa are the \"mighty Dragons.\" The Vayu Puranareplacing \"Surasa\" (of Vishnu Purana) by Danayas or Danavas -- the descendants of Danu by the sage Kasyapa -- andthose Danavas being the giants (or Titans) who warred against the gods, they are thus shown identical with the\"Dragons\" and \"Serpents\" of Wisdom.By simply comparing the Sun-gods of every country, one may find their allegories agreeing perfectly with one another;and the more the allegorical symbol is occult the more its corresponding symbol in other systems agrees with it. Thus, iffrom three systems widely differing from each other in appearance -- the old Aryan, the ancient Greek, and the modernChristian schemes -- we select several Sun-gods and dragons at random, these will be found copied from each other.Let us take Agni the fire-god, Indra the firmament, and Karttikeya from the Hindus; the Greek Apollo; and Mikael, the\"Angel of the Sun,\" the first of the AEons, called by the Gnostics \"the saviour\" -- and proceed in order.(1) Agni -- the fire-god -- is called in the Rig-Veda Vaiswanara. Now Vaisvanara is a Danava -- a giant-demon,* whosedaughters Puloma and Kalaka are the mothers of numberless Danavas (30 millions), by[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* He is thus named and included in the list of the Danavas in Vayu Purana; the Commentator of Bhagavata Purana callshim a son of Danu, but the name means also \"Spirit of Humanity.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 382 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Kasyapa,* and live in Hiranyapura, \"the golden city,\" floating in the air. Therefore, Indra is, in a fashion, the step-son ofthese two as a son of Kasyapa; and Kasyapa is, in this sense, identical with Agni, the fire-god, or Sun (Kasyapa-Aditya).To this same group belongs Skanda or Karttikeya (god of War, the six-faced planet Mars astronomically), a Kumara, orvirgin-youth, born of Agni** for the purpose of destroying Taraka, the Danava Demon, the grandson of Kasyapa byHiranyaksha, his son,*** whose (Taraka's) yogi austerities were so extraordinary that they became formidable to thegods, who feared such a rival in power.**** While Indra, the bright god of the Firmament, kills Vritra (or Ahi), the Serpent-Demon -- for which feat he is called Vritra-han, \"the destroyer of Vritra\"; he also leads the hosts of Devas (Angels orgods) against other gods who rebel against Brahma, for which he is entitled Jishnu, \"leader of the celestial Host.\"Karttikeya is found bearing the same titles. For killing Taraka, the Danava, he is Taraka-Jit, \"Vanquisher of Taraka,\"*****\"Kumara Guha,\" \"the mysterious Virgin-youth\" \"Siddha-Sena\" -- \"the leader of the Siddhas\"; and Saktidhara -- \"Spear-holder.\"(2.) Now take Apollo, the Grecian sun-god, and by comparing the mythical accounts given of him, see whether he doesnot answer both[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Kasyapa is called the Son of Brahma, and is the \"Self-Born\" to whom a great part of the work of creation is attributed.He is one of the seven Rishis; exoterically, the son of Marichi, the son of Brahma; while Atharva-veda says, \"The Self-born Kasyapa sprang from Time\"; and esoterically -- Time and Space are forms of the One incognizable Deity. As anAditya, Indra is son of Kasyapa, as also Vaivasvata Manu, our progenitor. In the instance given in the text, he is Kasyapa-Aditya, the Sun, and the Sun-god, from whom all the \"Cosmic\" Demons, Dragons (nagas), Serpent, or Snake-gods, andDanavas, the giants, are born. The meaning of the allegories given above is purely astronomical and cosmical, but willserve to prove the identity of all.** All such stories differ in the exoteric texts. In the Mahabharata, Karttikeya, \"the six-faced Mars,\" is the son of Rudra orSiva, Self-born without a mother from the seed of Siva cast into the fire. But Karttikeya is generally called Agnibhu, \"fireborn.\"*** Hiranyaksha is the ruler or king of the fifth region of Patala, a Snake-god.**** The Elohim also feared the knowledge of Good and Evil for Adam, and therefore are shown as expelling him fromEden or killing him spiritually.***** The story told is, that Taraka (called also Kalabhana), owing to his extraordinary Yoga-powers, had obtained all thedivine knowledge of yoga-vidya and occult powers of the gods, who conspired against him. Here we see the \"obedient\"Host of Archangels or minor gods conspiring against the (future) Fallen angels, whom Enoch accuses of the great crimeof disclosing to the world all \"the secret things done in heaven.\" It is Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Surgal and Uriel whodenounced to the Lord God those of their Brethren who were said to have pried into the divine mysteries and taught themto men: by this means they themselves escaped a like punishment. Michael was commissioned to fight the Dragon, andso was Karttikeya, and under the same circumstances. Both are \"leaders of the Celestial Host,\" both Virgins, both"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"\"leaders of Saints,\" \"Spear-holders\" (Saktidhara), etc., etc. Karttikeya is the original of Michael and St. George, as surelyas Indra is the prototype of Karttikeya.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 383 THE GODS, THE FACETS OF ONE GEM. to Indra, Karttikeya, and even Kasyapa-Aditya, and at the same time to Michael (as the Angelic form of Jehovah) the\"angel of the Sun,\" who is \"like,\" and \"one with, God.\" Later ingenious interpretations for monotheistic purposes, elevatedthough they be into not-to-be questioned Church dogmas, prove nothing, except the abuse of human authority andpower, perhaps.Apollo is Helios (the Sun), Phoibus-Apollo (\"the light of life and of the World\"*) who arises out of the golden-winged cup(the sun); hence he is the sun-god par excellence. At the moment of his birth he asks for his bow to kill Python, theDemon Dragon, who attacked his mother before his birth,** and whom he is divinely commissioned to destroy -- likeKarttikeya, who is born for the purpose of killing Taraka, the too holy and wise demon. Apollo is born on a sidereal islandcalled Asteria -- \"the golden star island,\" the \"earth which floats in the air,\" which is the Hindu golden Hiranyapura; \"he iscalled the pure, [[agnos]], Agnus Dei (the Indian Agni, as Dr. Kenealy thinks), and in the primal myth he is exempt \"fromall sensual love\" (\"Book of God,\" p. 88). He is, therefore, a Kumara, like Karttikeya, and as Indra was in his earlier life andbiographies. Python, moreover, the \"red Dragon,\" connects Apollo with Michael, who fights the Apocalyptic Dragon, whowants to attack the woman in child-birth (See Revelation xii.), as Python attacks Apollo's mother. Can any one fail to seethe identity? Had the Rt. Hon. W. E.

For the way to the Bible lies throughHermes, Bel, and Homer, as the way to these is through the Hindu and Chaldean religious symbols.The repetition of this archaic tradition is found in ch. xii. of St. John's Revelations, and comes from the Babylonianlegends without the smallest doubt, though the Babylonian story had its origin in the allegories of the Aryans.

(See the last pages of Vol. I., \"Isis Unveiled,\" Atlantis.)The symbols of the dragons and \"War in Heaven\" have, as already stated, more than one significance; religious,astronomical and geological events being included in the one common allegory. But it had also a Cosmological meaning.In India the Dragon story is repeated in one of its forms in the battles of Indra with Vritra. In the Vedas this Ahi-Vritra isreferred to as the Demon of Drought, the terrible hot Wind. Indra is shown to be constantly at war with him; and with thehelp of his thunder and lightning the god compels Ahi-Vritra to pour down in rain on Earth, and then slays him. Hence,Indra is called the Vritra-Han or \"the slayer of Vritra,\" as Michael is called the Conqueror and \"Slayer of the Dragon.\" Boththese \"Enemies\" are then the \"Old Dragon\" precipitated into the depths of the Earth, in this one sense.The Zend-Avestic Amshaspends are a Host with a leader like St. Michael over them, and seem identical with the legionsof Heaven, when one reads the Vendidad.

In the same Fargard(ii. and iii.), in his invocation against Angra Mainyu and his Host, Zarathustra appeals to them in these words: \"I invokethe seven bright Sravah with their sons and their flocks\" (42 Vendid. Saddh). The \"Sravah\" -- a word which theOrientalists have given up as one \"of unknown meaning\" -- means the same Amshaspends, but in their highest occultmeaning. The \"Sravah\" are the noumenoi of the phenomenal Amshaspends, the souls or spirits of those manifestedPowers; and \"their sons and their flock\" refers to the planetary angels and their sidereal flock of stars and constellations.\"Amshaspend\" is the exoteric term used in terrestrial combinations and affairs only. Zarathustra addresses Ahura Mazdaconstantly as \"thou, the maker of the material world.\" Ormazd is the father of our earth (Spenta Armaiti), and she isreferred to, when personified, as \"the fair daughter of Ahura Mazda\" (Fargard, XIX. ii.), who is also the creator of the Tree(of occult and spiritual knowledge and wisdom) from which the mystic and mysterious Caresma is taken. But the occultname of the bright God was never pronounced outside the temple.Samael or Satan, the seducing Serpent of Genesis, and one of the primeval angels who rebelled, is the name of the \"RedDragon.\" He is the Angel of Death, the Talmud saying that \"the Angel of Death and Satan are the same,\" and, killed byMichael, he is once more killed by St. George, who also is a Dragon Slayer; but see the transformations of this. Samael isidentical with the Simoom, the hot wind of the desert, or again with the Vedic demon of drought, as Vritra; \"Simoom iscalled Atabutos\" or -- Diabolos, the devil.Typhon, or the Dragon Aphophis -- the Accuser in the \"Book of the Dead\" -- is worsted by Horus, who pierces hisopponent's head with a spear; and Typhon is the all-destroying wind of the desert, the rebellious element that throwseverything into confusion. As Set -- he is the darkness of night, the murderer of Osiris, who is the light of day and the sun.Archaeology demonstrates that Horus is identical with Anubis,* whose effigy was discovered upon an Egyptianmonument, with a cuirass and a spear, like Michael and St. George.

(See Lenoir's \"Du Dragon de Metz.\")Cosmologically, then, all the Dragons and Serpents conquered by their \"Slayers\" are, in their origin, the turbulentconfused principles in Chaos, brought to order by the Sun-gods or creative powers. In the \"Book of the Dead\" thoseprinciples are called \"the Sons of Rebellion.\" (See also \"Egyptian Pantheon,\" pp. 20, 23.) \"In that night, the oppressor, themurderer of Osiris, otherwise called the deceiving Serpent (Verse 54) . . . . calls the Sons of Rebellion in Air, and whenthey arrive to the East of Heavens, then there is War in Heaven and in the entire World\" (v. 49, \"Book of the Dead,\" xvii.).In the Scandinavian Eddas the \"War\" of the Ases with the Hrim-thurses (frost-giants), and of Asathor with the Jotuns, theSerpents and Dragons and the \"wolf\" who comes out of \"Darkness\" --- is the repetition of the same myth. The \"evilSpirits,\"* having begun by being simply the emblems of Chaos, became euhemerized by the superstition of the rabble,until they have finally won the right of citizenship in the most civilized and learned races of this globe -- since its creationas alleged -- and became a dogma with Christians. As George Smith has it: \"The evil principles (Spirits) emblems ofChaos\" (in Chaldea and Assyria as in Egypt, we see) . . \"resist this change and make war on the Moon, the eldest son ofBel, drawing over to their side the Sun, Venus and the atmospheric god Vul.\" (\"Assyrian Discoveries,\" p. 403.) This is onlyanother version of the Hindu \"War in Heaven,\" between Soma, the moon, and the gods -- Indra being the atmosphericVul; which shows it plainly to be both a Cosmogonical and an astronomical allegory, woven into and drawn from theearliest theogony as taught in the Mysteries.It is in the religious doctrines of the Gnostics that the real meaning of the Dragon, the Serpent, the Goat, and all thosesymbols of powers now called Evil, can be seen the best; as it is they who divulged the esoteric nature of the JewishSubstitute for AIN-SOPH in their teachings; of the true meaning of which, while the Rabbins concealed it, the Christians,with a few exceptions, knew nothing. Surely Jesus of Nazareth would have hardly advised his apostles to showthemselves as wise as the serpent, had the latter been a symbol of the Evil one; nor would the Ophites, the learnedEgyptian Gnostics of \"the Brotherhood of the Serpent,\" have reverenced a living snake in their ceremonies as the emblemof WISDOM, the divine Sophia (and a type of the all-good, not the all-bad), were that reptile so closely connected withSatan. The fact is, that even as a common ophidian it has ever been a dual symbol; and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* These \"evil Spirits\" can by no means be identified with Satan or the Great Dragon.

The Dracovolans, the flying Dragon of the early painters, may be an exaggerated picture of the real extinct antediluvian animal; butthose who have faith in the Occult teachings believe that in the days of old there were such creatures as flying Dragons,or a kind of Pterodactyl, and that it is those gigantic winged lizards that served as the prototypes for the Seraph of Mosesand his great Brazen Serpent.* The Jews had worshipped the latter idol themselves, but, after the religious reformsbrought about by Hezekiah, turned round, and called that symbol of the great or Higher God of every other nation -- aDevil, and their own usurper -- the \"One God.\"**The appellation Sa'tan, in Hebrew satan, \"an adversary\" (from the verb shatana, \"to be adverse,\" to persecute) belongsby right to the first and cruelest \"adversary of all the other gods\" -- Jehovah, not to the Serpent, which spoke only wordsof sympathy and wisdom, and is at the worst, even in the dogma, \"the adversary of men.\" This dogma, based as it is onchapter iii. of Genesis, is as illogical and unjust as it is paradoxical. For who was the first to create that original andhence-forward universal tempter of man -- the woman? Not the serpent surely, but the \"Lord God\" himself, who, saying:--\"It is not good that the man should be alone\" -- made woman, and \"brought her unto the man\" (18-22). If the unpleasantlittle incident that followed was and is still to be regarded as the \"original sin,\" then it exhibits the Creator's divine foresightin a poor light indeed. It would have been far better for the first Adam (of chap. 1.) to have been left either \"male andfemale,\" or \"alone.\" It is the Lord God, evidently, who was the real cause of all the mischief, the \"agent provocateur,\" andthe Serpent -- only a prototype of Azazel, \"the scapegoat for the sin of (the God of) Israel,\" the poor Tragos having to paythe penalty for his Master's and Creator's blunder. This, of course, is addressed only to those who accept the openingevents of the drama of humanity in Genesis in their dead-letter sense. Those who read them esoterically, are not reducedto fanciful[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Numbers xxi. 8-9. God orders Moses to build a brazen Serpent \"Saraph\"; to look upon which heals those bitten bythe fiery serpents. The latter were the Seraphim, each one of which, as Isaiah shows (vi. 2), \"had six wings\"; they are thesymbols of Jehovah, and of all the other Demiurgi who produce out of themselves six sons or likenesses -- Seven withtheir Creator. Thus, the Brazen Serpent is Jehovah, the chief of the \"fiery serpents.\" And yet, in 2 Kings xviii., it is shownthat King Hezekiah, who, like as David his father, \"did that which was right in the sight of the Lord\" -- \"brake in pieces thebrazen serpent that Moses had made . . . and called it Nehushtan,\" or piece of brass.** And Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel (Chron. xxi. 1.) \"The anger of the Lord Jehovahwas kindled against Israel,\" and he moved David to say: \"Go, number Israel\" (2 Samuel, xxiv. 1).

It was a blind created purposely by the Rabbins, a secretpreserved by them with ten-fold care after the Christians had despoiled them of this God-name which was their ownproperty.* But the following statement is made. The personage who is named in the first four chapters of Genesisvariously as \"God,\" the \"Lord God,\" and \"Lord\" simply, is not one and the same person; certainly it is not Jehovah. Thereare three distinct classes or groups of the Elohim called Sephiroth in the Kabala, Jehovah appearing only in chapter iv., inthe first verse of which he is named Cain, and in the last transformed into mankind -- male and female, jah-veh.** The\"Serpent,\" moreover, is not Satan, but the bright Angel, one of the Elohim clothed in radiance and glory, who, promisingthe woman that if they ate of the forbidden fruit \"ye shall not surely die,\" kept his promise, and made man immortal in hisincorruptible nature. He is the Iao of the mysteries, the chief of the Androgyne creators of men. Chapter iii. contains(esoterically) the withdrawal of the veil of ignorance that closed the perceptions of the Angelic Man, made in the image ofthe \"Boneless\" gods, and the opening of his consciousness to his real nature; thus showing the bright Angel (Lucifer) inthe light of a giver of Immortality, and as the \"Enlightener\"; while the real Fall into generation and matter is to be sought inchapter iv. There, Jehovah-Cain, the male part of Adam the dual man, having separated himself from Eve, creates in her\"Abel,\" the first natural woman,* and sheds the Virgin blood. Now Cain, being shown identical with Jehovah, on theauthority of the correct reading of verse i. (chapter iv., Genesis), in the original Hebrew text; and the Rabbins teachingthat \"Kin (Cain), the Evil, was the Son of Eve by Samael, the devil who took Adam's place\"; and the Talmud adding that\"the evil Spirit, Satan, and Samael, the angel of Death, are the same\" --(Babba Battra, 16a) -- it becomes easy to see thatJehovah (mankind, or \"Jah-hovah\") and Satan (therefore the tempting Serpent) are one and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Dozens of the most erudite writers have sifted thoroughly the various meanings of the name J'hovah (with, and withoutthe masoretic points), and shown their multifarious bearings.

There is no Devil, no Evil, outside mankind to produce a Devil. Evil is a necessity in, and oneof the supporters of the manifested universe.

But in that case, light, goodness, beauty, etc., may be called Satan with as muchpropriety as the Devil, since they are the adversaries of darkness, badness, and ugliness. And now the philosophy andthe rationale of certain early Christian sects -- called heretical and viewed as the abomination of the times -- will becomemore comprehensible. We may understand how it was that the sect of SATANIANS came to be degraded, and wereanathematized without any hope of vindication in a future day, since they kept their tenets secret. How, on the sameprinciple, the CAINITES came to be degraded, and even the (Judas) ISCARIOTES; the true character of the treacherousapostle having never been correctly presented before the tribunal of Humanity.As a direct consequence, the tenets of the Gnostic sects also become clear. Each of these sects was founded by anInitiate, while their tenets were based on the correct knowledge of the symbolism of every nation. Thus it becomescomprehensible why Ilda-Baoth was regarded by most of them as the god of Moses, and was held as a proud, ambitious,and impure spirit, who had abused his power by usurping the place of the highest God, though he was no better, and insome respects far worse than his brethren Elohim; the latter representing the all-embracing, manifested deity only in theircollectivity, since they were the fashioners of the first differentiations of the primary Cosmic substance for the creation ofthe phenomenal Universe. Therefore Jehovah was called by the Gnostics the Creator of, and one with Ophiomorphos,the Serpent, Satan, or EVIL. (See \"Isis Unveiled,\" II, 184). They taught that Turbo and Adonai were \"names of Jao-Jehovah, who is an emanation of Ilda Baoth\" (Codex Nazaraeus). (See Part II., \"The Fallen Angels.\") This amounted intheir language to saying what the Rabbins expressed in a more veiled way, by stating that -- \"Cain had been generatedby Samael or Satan.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In Demonology, Satan is the leader of the opposition in Hell, the monarch of which was Beelzebub. He belongs to thefifth kind or class of demons (of which there are nine according to mediaeval demonology), and he is at the head ofwitches and sorcerers.

Thus the Elohim of the hour of creation became the \"Beni-Elohim,\" the sons of God, amongwhom is Satan -- in the Semitic traditions; war in heaven between Thraetaona and Azhi-dahaka, the destroying Serpent,ends on earth, according to Burnouf, in the battle of pious men against the power of Evil, \"of the Iranians with the AryanBrahmins of India.\" And the conflict of the gods with the Asuras is repeated in the Great War -- the Mahabharata. In thelatest religion of all, Christianity, all the Combatants, gods and demons, adversaries in both the camps, are nowtransformed into Dragons and Satans, simply in order to connect EVIL personified with the Serpent of Genesis, and thusprove the new dogma.*-------NOAH WAS A KABIR, HENCE HE MUST HAVE BEEN A DEMON.It matters little whether it is Isis, or Ceres -- the \"Kabiria\" -- or again the Kabiri, who have taught men agriculture; but it isvery important to prevent fanatics from monopolising all the facts in history and legend, and from fathering their distortionsof truth, history, and legend upon one man. Noah is either a myth along with the others, or one whose legend was builtupon the Kabirian or Titanic tradition, as taught in Samothrace; he has, therefore, no claim to be monopolized by eitherJew or Christian. If, as Faber tried to demonstrate at such cost of learning and research, Noah is an Atlantean and aTitan, and his family are the Kabiri or pious Titans, etc. -- then biblical chronology falls by its own weight, and along with itall the patriarchs -- the antediluvian and pre-Atlantean Titans. As now discovered and proven, Cain is Mars, the god ofpower and generation, and of the first (sexual) bloodshed.** Tubal-Cain is a Kabir, \"an instructor of every artificer in brassand iron\"; or -- if this will please better -- he is one with Hephaestos or Vulcan; Jabal is taken from the Kabiri -- instructorsin agriculture, \"such as have cattle,\" and Jubal is \"the father of all those who handle the harp,\" he, or they who fabricatedthe harp for Kronos and the trident for Poseidon.***[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide for further details upon the Satanic myth, Part II. on Symbolism, in this volume.** As he is also Vulcan or Vul-cain, the greatest god with the later Egyptians, and the greatest Kabir.

And is it not they who were destroyed by a deluge at thecommand of Zeus, as the Cainites were by that of Jehovah?"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Telchines are simply the Kabiri and the Titans, in another form. They are the Atlanteans also. \"Like Lemnos andSamothrace,\" says Decharme, \"Rhodes, the birth-place of the Telchines, is an island of volcanic formation.\" (Genii ofFire, p. 271.) The island of Rhodes emerged suddenly out of the seas, after having been previously engulfed by theOcean, say the traditions. Like Samothrace (of the Kabiri) it is connected in the memory of men with the Flood legends.As enough has been said on this subject, however, it may be left for the present.But we may add a few more words about Noah, the Jewish representative of nearly every pagan God in one or anothercharacter. The Homeric songs contain, poetized, all the later fables about the Patriarchs, who are all sidereal, cosmic,and numerical symbols and signs. The attempt to disconnect the two genealogies -- those of Seth and Cain* -- and thefurther attempt, as futile, to show them real, historical men, has only led to more serious inquiries into the history of thePast, and to discoveries which have damaged for ever the supposed revelation. For instance, the identity of Noah andMelchizedek being established, the further identity of Melchizedek, or Father Sadik, with Kronos-Saturn is proved also.That it is so may be easily demonstrated. It is not denied by any of the Christian writers. Bryant (See \"Analysis of AncientMythology,\" Vol. II., p. 760) concurs with all those who are of opinion, that Sydic, or[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Nothing could be more awkward and childish, we say, than this fruitless attempt to disconnect the genealogies of Cainand of Seth, or to conceal the identity of names under a different spelling. Thus, Cain has a Son ENOCH, and Seth a SonENOCH also (Enos, Ch'anoch, Hanoch; -- one may do what one likes with Hebrew unvowelled names). In the Cainite lineEnoch begets IRAD, Irad MEHUJAEL, the latter METHUSAEL, and Methusael, Lamech. In the Sethite line, Enoch begetsCainan, and this one MAHALEEL (a variation on Mehujael), who gives birth to JARAD (or Irad); Jarad to ENOCH(Number 3), who produces Methuselah (from Methusael), and finally Lamech closes the list. Now all these are symbols(Kabalistically) of solar and lunar years, of astronomical periods, and of physiological (phallic) functions, just as in anyother pagan symbolical creed. This has been proven by a number of writers.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 392 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Sadic, was the patriarch Noah (as also Melchizedek); and that the name by which he is called, or Sadic, corresponds tothe character given of him in Genesis, chap. vi., 9. \"He was [[diagram]], Sadic, a JUST man, and perfect in his generation.All science and every useful art were attributed to him, and through his sons transmitted to posterity.\" (See NewEncyclopaedia by Abraham Rees, F.R.S.)Now it is Sanchoniathon, who informs the world that the Kabiri were the Sons of Sydic or Zedek (Melchizedek). Trueenough, this information, having descended to us through Eusebius (Preparatio Evangelica), may be regarded with acertain amount of suspicion, as it is more than likely that he dealt with Sanchoniathon's works as he has with Manetho'sSynchronistic Tables. But let us suppose that the identification of Sydic, Kronos, or Saturn with Noah and Melchizedek, isbased on one of the Eusebian pious hypotheses. Let us accept it as such, along with Noah's characteristic as a just man,and his supposed duplicate, the mysterious Melchizedek, King of Salem, and priest of the high god, after \"his own order\"(See Hebrews, ch. v. 6, and vii. 1, et seq.); and finally, having seen what they all were spiritually, astronomically,psychically and cosmically, let us now see what they became rabbinically and KABALISTICALLY.Speaking of Adam, Kain, Mars, etc., as personifications, we find the author of \"The Source of Measures\" enunciating ourvery esoteric teachings in his Kabalistic researches. Thus he says:--\"Now Mars was the lord of birth and of death, of generation and of destruction, of ploughing, of building, of sculpture orstone-cutting, of Architecture . . . . in fine, of all . . . . ARTS. He was the primeval principle, disintegrating into themodification of two opposites for production. Astronomically, too,* he held the birthplace of the day and year, the place ofits increase of strength, Aries, and likewise the place of its death, Scorpio. He held the house of Venus, and that of theScorpion. He, as birth, was good; as death, was Evil. As good, he was light; as bad, he was night. As good, he was man;as bad, he was woman. He held the cardinal points, and as Cain, or Vulcan,** or Pater Sadic, or Melchizadek, he waslord of the Ecliptic, or[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The AEolian name of Mars was [[Areus]], and the Greek Ares, [[Ares]], is a name over the etymological significance ofwhich, philologists and Indianists, Greek and Sanskrit scholars have vainly worked to this day.

Welcker, however, offers more correct etymologies. (See Griech.Gotterlehre, I., 415.) However it may be, etymologies of roots and words alone will never yield the esoteric meaning fully,though they may help to useful guesses.** As the same author shows: \"The very name Vulcain appears in the reading; for in the first words (of chap. iv.

This was well proven by Bailly.Let us pause for a moment to examine these traditions from every available source, to compare the better those of theMagi with the so-called Grecian \"fables.\"Those legends have now passed into popular tales, the folklore of Persia, as many a real fiction has found its way intoour universal History.

The Devs were giants, strong and wicked;the Peris were smaller in stature, but wiser and kinder.Here we recognize the Atlantean giants and the Aryans, or the Rakshasas of the Ramayana and the children of BharataVarsha, or India; the ante- and the post-diluvians of the Bible.Gyan (or rather Gnan, true or occult Wisdom and knowledge), also called Gian-ben-Gian (or Wisdom, son of Wisdom),was the king of the Peris.* He had a shield as famous as that of Achilles, only instead of serving against an enemy in war,it served as a protection against black magic, the sorcery of the Devs. Gian-ben-Gian had reigned 2,000 years when Iblis,the devil, was permitted by God to defeat the Devs and scatter them to the other end of the world. Even the magic shield,which, produced on the principles of astrology, destroyed charms, enchantments, and bad spells, could not prevailagainst Iblis, who was an agent of Fate (or Karma).** They count ten kings in their last metropolis called Khanoom, andmake the tenth, Kaimurath, identical with the Hebrew Adam. These kings answer to the ten antediluvian generations ofkings as given by Berosus.Distorted as those legends are now found, one can hardly fail to identify them with the Chaldean, Egyptian, Greek, andeven Hebrew traditions. The latter, disdaining in its exclusiveness to speak of pre-adamite nations, yet allows these to beclearly inferred, by sending out Cain -- one of the two only living men on earth -- into the land of Nod, where he getsmarried and builds a city (Gen. iv.), etc.Now if we compare the 9,000 years mentioned by the Persian tales with the 9,000 years, which Plato declared hadpassed since the submersion of the last Atlantis, a very strange fact is made apparent. Bailly remarked, but distorted it byhis interpretation. The Secret Doctrine may restore the figures to their true meaning. \"First of all,\" we read in \"Critias\" that\"one must remember that 9,000 years have elapsed since the war of the nations, which lived above and outside thePillars of Hercules, and those which peopled the lands on this side.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Some derive the word from Paras which produced Pars, Persia, Pars; but it may be equally derived from Pitar or Pitris,the Hindu progenitors of the Fifth Race -- the Fathers of Wisdom or the Sons of \"Will and Yoga\" -- who were called Pitar,as were the divine Pitars of the First Race.** See for these traditions the \"Collection of Persian Legends,\" in Russian, Georgian, Armenian, and Persian; Herbelot'snarrative Legendes Persanes, \"Bibliotheque Orientale,\" p. 298, 387, etc., and Danville's Memoires.

But there is, intruth. Plato, being an Initiate, had to use the veiled language of the Sanctuary, and so had the Magi of Chaldea andPersia, through whose exoteric revelations the Persian legends were preserved and passed to posterity. Thus, one findsthe Hebrews calling a week \"seven days,\" and \"a week of years\" when each of its days represents 360 solar years, andthe whole \"week\" is 2,520 years, in fact. They had a Sabbatical week, a Sabbatical year, etc., etc., and their Sabbathlasted indifferently 24 hours or 24,000 years -- in their secret calculations of the Sods. We of the present times call an agea century. They of Plato's day, the initiated writers, at any rate, meant by a millenium, not a thousand but 100,000 years;Hindus, more independent than any, never concealed their chronology. Thus, when saying 9,000 years, the Initiates willread 900,000 years, during which space of time -- i.e, from the first appearance of the Aryan race, when the Plioceneportions of the once great Atlantis began gradually sinking* and other continents to appear on the surface, down to thefinal disappearance of Plato's small island of Atlantis, the Aryan races had never ceased to fight with the descendants ofthe first giant races. This war lasted till nearly the close of the age which preceded the Kali Yug, and was theMahabharatean war so famous in Indian History. Such blending of the events and epochs, and the bringing down ofhundreds of thousands into thousands of years, does not interfere with the numbers of years that had elapsed, accordingto the statement made by the Egyptian priests to Solon, since the destruction of the last portion of Atlantis. The 9,000years were the correct figures given. The latter event has never been kept a secret, and had only faded out of thememory of the Greeks. The Egyptians had their records complete, because isolated; for, being surrounded by sea anddesert, they had been left untrammelled by other nations, till about a few millenniums before our era.History, for the first time, catches a glimpse of Egypt and its great mysteries through Herodotus, if we do not take intoaccount the Bible, and its queer chronology.** And how little Herodotus could tell is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The main continent perished in the Miocene times, as already stated.** From Bede downwards all the chronologists of the Church have differed among themselves, and contradicted eachother. \"The chronology of the Hebrew text has been grossly altered, especially in the interval next after the Deluge\":--says Whiston (Old Test., p. 20).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 396 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.confessed by himself when speaking of a mysterious tomb of an Initiate at Sais, in the sacred precinct of Minerva. There,he says \"behind the chapel . . . is the tomb of One, whose name I consider it impious to divulge . . . In the enclosure standlarge obelisks and there is a lake near, surrounded with a stone wall formed in a circle. In this lake they perform by night,that person's adventures, which they call Mysteries: on these matters, however, though I am accurately acquainted withthe particulars of them, I must observe a discreet silence\" (ii. 170).On the other hand, it is well to know that no secret was so well preserved and so sacred with the ancients, as that of theircycles and computations. From the Egyptians down to the Jews it was held as the highest sin to divulge anythingpertaining to the correct measure of time. It was for divulging the secrets of the Gods, that Tantalus was plunged into theinfernal regions; the keepers of the sacred Sibylline Books were threatened with the death penalty for revealing a wordfrom them. Sigalions (images of Harpocrates) were in every temple -- especially in those of Isis and Serapis -- eachpressing a finger to the lips; while the Hebrews taught that to divulge, after initiation into the Rabbinical mysteries, thesecrets of Kabala, was like eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: it was punishable by death.And yet, we Europeans accepted the exoteric chronology of the Jews! What wonder that it has influenced and colouredever since all our conceptions of science and the duration of things!The Persian traditions, then, are full of two nations or races, now entirely extinct, as some think; whereas, they are onlytransformed. They are ever speaking of, and describing the mountains of Kaf (Kafaristan?), which contain a gallery builtby the giant Argeak, wherein the statues of the ancient men under all their forms are preserved. They call them Sulimans(Solomons), or the wise kings of the East, and count seventy-two kings of that name.* Three among them reigned for1,000 years each. (Herbelot, p. 829.)Siamek, the beloved son of Kaimurath (Adam), their first king, died murdered by his giant brother. The father had aperpetual fire preserved on the tomb which contained his cremated ashes; hence -- the origin of fire-worship, as someOrientalists think.Then came Huschenk, the prudent and the wise. It was his dynasty which re-discovered metals and precious stones,which had been concealed by the Devs or Giants in the bowels of the earth; how to make brass-work, to cut canals, andimprove agriculture. As usual, it is Huschenk, again, who is credited with having written the work called[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Thence King Solomon, whose traces are nowhere to be found outside of the Bible, and the description of whosemagnificent palace and city dovetail with those of the Persian tales; though they were unknown to all pagan travellers,even to Herodotus.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 397 THE PERSIAN PHOENIX.\"Eternal Wisdom,\" and even with having built the cities of Luz, Babylon and Ispahan, though they were built ages later.But as modern Delhi is built on six other older cities, so these just-named cities may be built on emplacements of othercities of an immense antiquity.

This dodecaped was found on the \"dryisland\" or new continent; much force and cunning had to be used to secure the wonderful animal, but no sooner hadHuschenk mounted him, than he defeated every enemy. No giants could withstand his tremendous power.Notwithstanding, this king of kings was killed by an enormous rock thrown at him by the giants from the great mountainsof Damavend.*Tahmurath is the third king of Persia, the St. George of Iran, the knight who always has the best of, and who kills, theDragon. He is the great enemy of the Devs who, in his day, dwelled in the mountains of Kaf, and occasionally made raidson the Peris. The old French chronicles of the Persian folklore call him the Dev-bend, the conqueror of the giants. He, too,is credited with having founded Babylon, Nineveh, Diarbek, etc., etc. Like his grand-sire Huschenk, Tahmurath(Taimuraz) also had his steed, only far more rare and rapid -- a bird called Simorgh-Anke. A marvellous bird, in truth,intelligent, a polyglot, and even very religious. (See Orient. Collect. ii., 119.) What says that Persian Phoenix? Itcomplains of its old age, for it is born cycles and cycles before the days of Adam (also Kaimurath). It has witnessed therevolutions of long centuries. It has seen the birth and the close of twelve cycles of 7,000 years each, which multipliedesoterically will give us again 840,000 years.** (Orient. Collect. ii., 119 et seq.)

Esoterically, Adam Rishoon is the lunar Spirit (Jehovah, in a sense, or the Pitris) andhis three Sons -- Ka-yin, Habel, and Seth -- represent the three races, as already explained. Noah-Xisuthrus represents inhis turn (in the cosmo-geological key) the 3rd Race separated, and his three sons, its last three races; Ham, moreover,symbolizing that race which uncovered the \"nakedness\" of the Parent Race, and of the \"Mindless,\" i.e., committed sin.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Orient.

This refers to 7 Rounds, 7 Root-races, and sub-races, the truly occult figures, though sorely confused.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 398 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Tahmurath visits on his winged steed (Ahriman) the Mountains of Koh-Kaf or Kaph. He finds there the Peris ill-treated bythe giants, and slays Argen, and the giant Demrusch. Then he liberates the good Peri, Mergiana*, whom Demrusch hadkept as a prisoner, and takes her over to the dry island, i.e., the new continent of Europe.** After him came Giamschid,who builds Esikekar, or Persepolis. This king reigns 700 years, and believes himself, in his great pride, immortal, anddemands divine honours. Fate punishes him, he wanders for 100 years in the world under the name of Dhulkarnayn \"thetwo horned.\" But this epithet has no connection with the \"two-horned\" gentleman of the cloven foot. The \"two-horned\" isthe epithet given in Asia, uncivilized enough to know nothing of the attributes of the devil, to those conquerors who havesubdued the world from the East to the West.Then come the usurper Zohac, and Feridan, one of the Persian heroes, who vanquishes the former, and shuts him up inthe mountains of Damavend. These are followed by many others down to Kaikobad, who founded a new dynasty.Such is the legendary history of Persia, and we have to analyze it. What are the mountains of Kaf to begin with?Whatever they may be in their geographical status, whether they are the Caucasian or Central Asian mountains, it is farbeyond these mountains to the North, that legend places the Devs and Peris; the latter the remote ancestors of theParses or Farses. Oriental tradition is ever referring to an unknown glacial, gloomy sea, and to a dark region, withinwhich, nevertheless, are situated the Fortunate Islands, wherein bubbles, from the beginning of life on earth, the fountainof life (Herbelot, p. 593; Armenian Tales, p. 35). But the legend asserts, moreover, that a portion of the first dry island(continent), having detached itself from the main body, has remained, since then, beyond the mountains of Koh-kaf, \"thestony girdle that surrounds the world.\" A journey of seven months' duration will bring him who is possessed of \"Soliman'sring\" to that \"fountain,\" if he keeps on journeying North straight before him as the bird flies. Journeying therefore fromPersia straight north, will bring one along the sixtieth degree of longitude, holding to the west, to Nova Zemblia; and fromthe Caucasus to the eternal ice beyond the Arctic circle would land one between 60 and 45 degrees of longitude, orbetween Nova Zemblia and Spitzbergen.

He says: \"The lands we live in are surrounded by the ocean, but beyond that ocean there is another landwhich touches the walls of the sky; and it is in this land that man was created and lived in paradise. During the Deluge,Noah was carried in his ark into the land his posterity now inhabits.\" (Ibid.) The twelve-legged horse of Huschenk wasfound on that continent named the dry island. (Supra, p. 154.)The \"Christian topography\" of Cosmas Indicopleustes and its merits are well known; but here the good father repeats auniversal tradition, now, moreover, corroborated by facts. Every arctic traveller suspects a continent or a \"dry island\"beyond the line of eternal ice.

The Secret Doctrine teaches that the early Third Race builtboats and flotillas before it built houses. But the \"horse,\" though a much later animal, has, nevertheless, a more occultprimitive meaning. The crocodile and the hippopotamus were held sacred and represented divine symbols, both with theancient Egyptians and with the Mexicans. Poseidon is, in Homer, the God of the Horse, and assumes that form himself toplease Ceres. Arion, their progeny, is one of the aspects of that \"horse,\" which is a cycle.*** The severed parts must be Norway and other lands in the neighbourhood of the Arctic Circle.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 400 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"In the first beginnings of (human) life, the only dry land was on the Right end* of the sphere, where it (the globe) ismotionless.** The whole earth was one vast watery desert, and the waters were tepid . . . .

Meru is not \"the fabulous mountain in the navel or centre of the earth,\" butits roots and foundations are in that navel, though it is in the far north itself. This connects it with the \"central\" land \"thatnever perishes\"; the land in which \"the day of the mortal lasts six months and his night another six months.\" As theVishnu Purana has it: \"for the North of Meru there is, therefore, always night during day in other regions; for Meru is northof all the dwipas and varshas\" (islands and countries). (Book II., chap. viii.) Meru is therefore neither on Atlas as Wilfordsuggests, nor, as Wilson tried to show, \"absolutely in the centre of the globe,\" only because \"relatively with the inhabitantsof the several portions, to all of whom the East is that quarter where the sun first appears.\"** Even the Commentaries do not refrain from Oriental metaphor.

This brokeasunder and disappeared. In the early part of the Third Race -- Lemuria was formed (Vide supra). When it was destroyedin its turn, Atlantis appeared.-------WESTERN SPECULATIONS,FOUNDED ON THE GREEK AND PURANIC TRADITIONS.Thus it becomes natural to find that, on even such meagre data as have reached the profane historian, Rudbeck, aSwedish scientist, tried to prove about two centuries ago that Sweden was the Atlantis of Plato. He thought, even, that hehad found in the configuration of ancient Upsala, the situation and measurements given by the Greek sage of the capitalof \"Atlantis.\" As Bailly proved, Rudbeck was mistaken; but so was Bailly likewise, and still more. For Sweden and Norwayhad formed part and parcel of ancient Lemuria, and also of Atlantis on the European side, just as Eastern and WesternSiberia and Kamschatka had belonged to it, on the Asiatic. Only, once more, when was it? We can find it outapproximately only by studying the Puranas, if we will have nought to do with the Secret teachings.Three quarters of a century have already elapsed since Captain (now Colonel) Wilford brought forward his fancifultheories about the British islands being the \"White Island,\" the Atala of the Puranas. This was sheer nonsense, as theAtala is one of the seven dwipas, or islands, belonging to the nether lokas, one of the seven regions of Patala (theantipodes). Moreover, as Wilford* shows, the Puranas place it \"on[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] to those who are situated in places of no latitude (niraksha) both these havetheir place in the horizon. Hence there is (on that land) no elevation of the poles, the two pole-stars being situated in theirhorizon; but their degrees of colatitude (lumbaka) are 90; at Meru the degrees of latitude (aksha) are of the samenumber.\" (43 and 44.)* Wilford makes many mistakes. He identifies, for instance, Sveta-dwipa (the white Island), the \"island in the northern partof Toyambhudi,\" with England, and then tries to identify it with Atala (a nether region) and Atlantis. Now the former is theabode of Vishnu, exoterically, and Atala is a hell. He also places it in the Euxine or Icshu (Black) Sea, and then seems toconnect it, in another place, with Africa and Atlas."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 403 ORIENTALISTS IN THE WRONG BOX.the seventh zone or seventh climate,\" -- rather, on the seventh measure of heat: which thus locates it between thelatitudes of 24 and 28 degrees north. It is then to be sought on the same degree as the Tropic of Cancer, whereasEngland is between the 50th and 60th degrees of latitude. Wilford speaks of it as Atala, Atlantis, the white island. And invol. viii. of Journal of Asiatic Researches, p. 280, its enemy is called the \"White Devil,\" the demon of terror. For he says:\"In their (the Hindu and Mahomedan) romances, we see Kai-caus going to the mountain of 'As-burj, at the foot of whichthe Sun sets,' to fight the Dev-Sefid, or white devil, the Taradaitya of the Puranas, whose abode was on the seventhstage of the world, answering to the seventh zone of the Buddhists, or the White Island.\"Now here the Orientalists have been, and are still, facing the Sphinx's riddle, the wrong solution of which will ever destroytheir authority, if not their persons, in the eyes of every Hindu scholar, even those who are not initiates. For there is not astatement in the Puranas -- on the conflicting details of which Wilford based his speculations -- which has not severalmeanings, and does not apply to both the physical and the metaphysical worlds. If the old Hindus divided the face of theglobe geographically into seven zones, climates, dwipas, and into seven hells and seven heavens, allegorically, thatmeasure of seven did not apply in both cases to the same localities. It is the north pole, the country of \"Meru,\" which isthe seventh division, as it answers to the Seventh principle (or fourth metaphysically), of the occult calculation, for itrepresents the region of Atma, of pure soul, and Spirituality. Hence Pushkara is shown as the seventh zone, or dwipa,which encompasses the Kshira Ocean, or Ocean of milk (the ever-frozen white region) in the Vishnu (and other) Puranas(Book II ch. iv.). And Pushkara, with its two Varshas, lies directly at the foot of Meru. For it is said that \"the two countriesnorth and south of Meru are shaped like a bow,\" . . and that \"one half of the surface of the earth is on the south of Meruand the other half on the north of Meru -- beyond which is half of Pushkara\" (Vishnu Purana, Asiatic Researches, etc.).Geographically, then, Pushkara is America, Northern and Southern; and allegorically it is the prolongation of Jambu-dwipa* in the middle of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Every name in the Puranas has to be examined at least under two aspects; geographically, and metaphysically, in itsallegorical application; e.g., Nila, the (blue) mountain which is one of the boundaries to the north of Meru, is again to besought geographically in a mountain range in Orissa, and again in a mountain quite different from the others (in WesternAfrica). Jambu-dwipa is Vishnu's dominion -- the world, limited in the Puranas to our globe, the region which containsMeru only, and again it is divided to contain Bharata-varsha (India), its best division, and the fairest, says Parasara.Likewise with Pushkara and all others.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 404 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.which stands Meru, for it is the country inhabited by beings who live ten thousand years, who are free from sickness orfailing; where there is neither virtue nor vice, caste or laws, for these men are \"of the same nature as the Gods,\" (VishnuPurana, Book II. ch. iv.). Wilford is inclined to see Meru in Mount Atlas, and locates there also the Loka-lokas. Now Meru,we are told, which is the Swar-loka, the abode of Brahma, of Vishnu, and the Olympus of Indian exoteric religions, isdescribed geographically as \"passing through the middle of the earth-globe, and protruding on either side\" (SuryaSiddhanta, v. 5, Whitney's trans.). On its upper station are the gods, on the nether (or South pole) is the abode of demons(hells). How can then Meru be Mount Atlas? Besides which, Taradaitya, a demon, cannot be placed on the seventh zoneif the latter is identified with the \"white\" Island, which is Sveta-dwipa, for reasons given in the foot-note. (Vide infra.)Wilford accuses the modern Brahmans \"of having jumbled them (islands and countries) all together\" (A.R. III. 300); but hejumbled them still more. He believes that as the Brahmanda and Vayu Puranas divide the old continent into sevendwipas, said to be surrounded by a vast ocean, beyond which lie the regions and mountains of Atala (ibid), hence \"mostprobably the Greeks divided the nation of Atlantis, which, as it could not be found after having once been discovered,they conceived to have been destroyed by some shock of nature.\"Finding certain difficulties in believing that the Egyptian priests, Plato, and even Homer, had all built their notions ofAtlantis on Atala -- a nether region located at the Southern pole -- we prefer holding to the statements given in the secretbooks. We believe in the seven \"continents,\" four of which have already lived their day, the fifth still exists, and two are toappear in the future. We believe that each of these is not strictly a continent in the modern sense of the word, but thateach name, from Jambu down to Pushkara,* refers to the geographical names given (i.) to the dry lands covering the faceof the whole earth during the period of a Root-Race, in general; and (ii.) to what remained of these after a geological(race) Pralaya -- as \"Jambu,\" for instance: and (iii.) to those localities which will enter, after the future cataclysms, into theformation of new universal \"continents,\" peninsulas, or dwipas** -- each continent being, in one sense, a greater orsmaller region of dry land surrounded with water. Thus, that whatever[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Jambu, Plaksha, Salmali, Kusa, Krauncha, Saka, and Pushkara.** Such as Saka and Pushkara, for instance, which do not yet exist, but into which will enter such lands as some portionsof America, of Africa, and Central Asia, with the Gobi region. Let us bear in mind that Upadwipas means \"root\" islands, orthe dry land in general.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 405 FUTURE CONTINENTS, SYMBOLIZED.\"jumble\" the nomenclature of these may represent to the profane, there is none, in fact, to him who has the key."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Thus, we believe we know that, though two of the Puranic \"islands\" -- the sixth and seventh \"continents\" -- are yet tocome, nevertheless there were, or there are, lands which will enter into the composition of the future dry lands, of newearths whose geographical faces will be entirely changed, as were those of the past. Therefore we find in the Puranasthat Saka-dwipa is (or will be) a continent, and that Sankha-dwipa, as shown in the Vayu Purana, is only \"a minor island,\"one of the nine divisions (to which Vayu adds six more) of Bharata Varsha. Because Sankha-dwipa was peopled by\"Mlechchhas (unclean foreigners), who worshipped Hindu divinities,\" therefore they were connected with India.* Thisaccounts for Sankhasura, a King of a portion of Sankha-dwipa, who was killed by Krishna; that King who resided in thepalace \"which was an ocean shell, and whose subjects lived in shells also,\" says Wilford.\"On the banks of the Nile** (?) there were frequent contests between the Devatas (divine beings, demi-gods) and theDaityas (giants); but the latter tribe having prevailed, their King, Sankhasura, who resided in the Ocean, made frequentincursions in the night\" (As. Res., Vol. III. 225.)It is not on the banks of the Nile, but on the coasts of Western Africa, south of where now lies Morocco, that these battlestook place. There was a time when the whole of the Sahara desert was a sea, then a continent as fertile as the Delta, andthen, only after another temporary submersion, it became a desert similar to that other wilderness, the desert of Shamo orGobi. This is shown in Puranic tradition, for on the same page as above cited, it is said: \"The people were between twofires; for, while Sankhasura was ravaging one side of the continent, Krauncha (or Cracacha), King of Kraunch, used todesolate the other; both armies . . . thus changed the most fertile regions into a savage desert.\"That not only the last island of Atlantis, spoken of by Plato, but a large continent, first divided, and then broken later oninto seven peninsulas and islands (called dwipas), preceded Europe, is sure. It covered the whole of the North and SouthAtlantic regions, as well as portions of the North and South Pacific, and had islands even in the Indian Ocean (relics ofLemuria). The claim is corroborated by Indian Puranas, Greek writers, and Asiatic, Persian, and Mohammedan traditions.Wilford, who confuses sorely the Hindu and the Mussulman legends, shows this, however, clearly. (See Vol. VIII., X. andXI. of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* They were called demons, Asuras, giants, and monsters, because of their wickedness; and thus their country waslikened to Atala -- a hell, because of that.** Not on the river Nile, surely, but near the Nila mountains of the Atlas range.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 406 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Asiatic Researches.) And his facts and quotations from the Puranas give direct and conclusive evidence that the AryanHindus and other ancient nations were earlier navigators than the Phoenicians, who are now credited with having beenthe first seamen that appeared in the post-diluvian times. This is what is given in the Journal of the Asiatic Society, III.,pp. 325, et seq.:--\"In their distress the few nations who survived (in the war between Devatas and Daityas) raised their hands to Bhagavan,'Let him who can deliver us . . . be our King'; using the word I'T (a magic term not understood by Wilford, evidently) whichre-echoed through the whole country.\"Then comes a violent storm, the waters of the Kali are strangely agitated, \"when there appeared from the waves . . aman, afterwards called I'T, at the head of a numerous army, saying abhayan, no fear\" . . . and scattered the enemy. \"TheKing I'T,\" explains Wilford, \"is a subordinate incarnation of M'rira\" (Mrida, a form of Rudra, probably?) who \"re-establishedpeace and prosperity throughout all Sankha-dwipa, through Barbaradesa, Hissast'han and Awasthan or Arabia . . \" etc.,etc.Surely, if the Hindu Puranas give a description of wars on continents and islands situated beyond Western Africa in theAtlantic Ocean; if their writers speak of Barbaras and other people such as Arabs -- they who were never known tonavigate, or cross the Kala pani (the black waters of the Ocean) in the days of Phoenician navigation -- then theirPuranas must be older than those Phoenicians (placed at from 2,000 to 3,000 years B.C.). At any rate those traditionsmust have been older;* as --\"In the above accounts,\" writes an adept, \"the Hindus speak of this island as existing and in great power; it must,therefore, have been more than eleven thousand years ago.\"But another calculation and proof may be adduced of the great antiquity of these Hindu Aryans who knew of (becausethey had once dwelt in it) and described the last surviving island of Atlantis -- or rather of that remnant of the Easternportion of that continent which had[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Says Wilford of the division of Atlantis and Bharata or India, confusing the two accounts and Priyavrata with Medhatithi:-- \"The division was made by Priyavrata. . . .

One of them had . . . the extremity of the Atlantis\" --which \"is probably the old continent. . . . This Atlantis was overwhelmed by a flood. . . . and it seems that by Atlantis weshould understand the Antediluvian Earth over which ten princes were born to rule according to the mythology of theWest (and of the East, also) but seven only of them sat upon the throne.\" (Vol. III. p. 286.) . . Some also are of opinionthat of the seven dwipas six were destroyed by a flood (Vol. VIII. p. 367).

This may be demonstrated,moreover, on an astronomical calculation by an adept who criticises Wilford. For recalling what the Orientalist hadbrought forward concerning the Mount Ashburj \"at the foot of which the sun sets,\" where was the war between theDevatas and the Daityas,** he says:--\"We will consider, then, the latitude and longitude of the lost island, and of the remaining Mount Ashburj. It was on theseventh stage of the world, i.e., in the seventh climate (which is between the latitude of 24 degrees and latitude 28degrees north) . . . This island, the daughter of the Ocean, is frequently described as lying in the West; and the sun isrepresented as setting at the foot of its mountain (Ashburj, Atlas, Teneriffe or Nila, no matter the name), and fighting thewhite Devil of the 'White Island.' \"Now, considering this statement from its astronomical aspect, and knowing that Krishna is the incarnated Sun (Vishnu), asolar God; and that he is said to have killed Dev-Sefid, the white giant -- a possible personification of the ancientinhabitants at the foot of the Atlas -- perchance Krishna may be only a representation of the vertical beams of the Sun?Those inhabitants (the Atlantides) are, we have seen, accused by Diodorus of daily cursing the Sun, and ever fighting hisinfluence. This is an astronomical interpretation of course. But it will now be proved that Sankhasura, and Sancha dwipa,and all their history, is also geographically and ethnologically Plato's \"Atlantis\" in Hindu dress.It was just remarked that since, in the Puranic accounts, the island is still existing, then those accounts must be older thanthe 11,000 years elapsed since Sancha dwipa, or the Poseidonis of Atlantis, disappeared. Is it not barely possible thatHindus should have known the island still earlier? Let us turn again to astronomical demonstrations, which make thisquite plain if one assumes, according to the said adept, that \"at the time when the summer tropical 'colure' passedthrough the Pleiades, when cor-Leonis would be upon the equator; and when Leo was vertical to Ceylon at sunset, thenwould Taurus be vertical to the island of Atlantis at noon.\"This explains, perhaps, why the Singhalese, the heirs of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* America, the \"new\" world -- is thus, though not much, older; still it is older than Europe, the \"old world.\"** If Div or Dev-Sefid's (the Taradaitya's) abode was on the seventh stage, it is because he came from Pushkara, thePatala (antipodes) of India, or from America. The latter touched the walls, so to say, of Atlantis, before the latter sankfinally. The word Patala, meaning both the antipodal countries and infernal regions, thus became synonymous in ideasand attributes as well as in name.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 408 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Rakshasas and Giants of Lanka, and the direct descendants of Singha, or Leo, became connected with Sancha dwipa orPoseidonis (Plato's Atlantis). Only, as shown by Mackey's \"Sphinxiad,\" this must have occurred about 23,000 years ago,astronomically; at which time the obliquity of the ecliptic must have been rather more than 27 degrees, and consequentlyTaurus must have passed over \"Atlantis\" or \"Sancha dwipa.\" And that it was so is clearly demonstrated.\"The sacred bull Nandi was brought from Bharata to Sancha to meet Rishabha (Taurus) every Kalpa. But when those ofthe White Island (who descended originally from Sveta dwipa),* who had mixed with the Daityas (giants) of the land ofiniquity, had become black with Sin, then Nandi remained for ever in the \"White Island\" (or Sveta dwipa.) \"Those of theFourth World (race) lost AUM\" -- say the Commentaries.Asburj (or Azburj), whether the peak of Teneriffe or not, was a volcano, when the sinking of the \"western Atala\" (or hell)began, and those who were saved told the tale to their children. Plato's Atlantis perished between water below and fireabove; the great mountain vomiting flames all the while. \"The 'fire-vomiting Monster' survived alone out of the ruins of theunfortunate island.\"Do the Greeks, accused of borrowing a Hindu fiction (Atala), and inventing from it another (Atlantis), stand also accusedof getting their geographical notions and the number seven from them? (Vide in Part II. the several sections on theSEPTENATE in nature.)\"The famous Atlantis exists no longer, but we can hardly doubt that it did once,\" says Proclus, \"for Marcellus, who wrote ahistory of Ethiopian affairs, says that such, and so great an island once existed, and this is evidenced by those whocomposed histories relative to the external sea. For they relate that in this time there were seven islands in the Atlanticsea sacred to Proserpine; and besides these, three of immense magnitude, sacred to Pluto . . . Jupiter . . . and Neptune.And, besides this, the inhabitants of the last island (Poseidonis) preserved the memory of the prodigious magnitude of theAtlantic island as related by their ancestors, and of its governing for many periods all the islands in the Atlantic sea. Fromthis isle one may pass to other large[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Neither Atlantis, nor yet Sancha dwipa, was ever called \"White Island.\" When tradition says that \"the White Islandbecame black on account of the sins of people\" it only means the denizens of the \"White Island,\" or Siddhapura, or Svetadwipa, who descended to the Atlantis of the Third and Fourth races, to \"inform the latter; and who, having incarnated,became black with sin\" -- a figure of speech. All the Avatars of Vishnu are said to come originally from the White Island.According to Tibetan tradition the White Island is the only locality which escapes the general fate of other dwipas and canbe destroyed by neither fire nor water, for -- it is the \"eternal land.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 409 WHAT MARCELLUS SAYS."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"islands beyond, which are not far from the firm land, near which is the true sea.\"\"These seven dwipas (inaccurately rendered islands) constitute, according to Marcellus, the body of the famous Atlantis,\"writes Wilford himself. . . . . This evidently shows that Atlantis is the old continent. . . . The Atlantis was destroyed after aviolent storm (?): this is well known to the Puranics, some of whom assert that in consequence of this dreadful convulsionof nature, six of the dwipas disappeared\" . . . (xi., 27).Enough proofs have now been given to satisfy the greatest sceptic. Nevertheless, direct proofs based on exact scienceare also added. Volumes might be written, however, to no purpose for those who will neither see nor hear, except throughthe eyes and ears of their respective authorities.Hence the teaching of the Roman Catholic scholiasts, namely, that Hermon, the mount in the land of Mizpeth -- meaning\"anathema,\" \"destruction\" -- is the same as Mount Armon. As a proof of this, Josephus is often quoted, as affirming thatstill in his own day enormous bones of giants were daily discovered on it. But it was the land of Balaam the prophet,whom the \"Lord loved well\"; and so mixed up are facts and personages in the said scholiasts' brains, that, when theZohar explains the \"birds\" which inspired Balaam to mean \"Serpents,\" to wit, the wise men and adepts at whose schoolhe had learnt the mysteries of prophecy -- the opportunity is again taken of showing Mount Hermon inhabited by the\"winged dragons of Evil, whose chief is Samael\" (the Jewish Satan).\"It is to those unclean spirits chained on Mount Hermon of the Desert, that the scapegoat of Israel, who assumed thename of one of them (Azaz(y)el), was sent\" (Spencer).We say it is not so. The Zohar has the following explanation on the practice of magic which is called in HebrewNehhaschim, or the \"Serpents' Works.\" It says (Part III. col. 302):-- \"It is called nehhaschim, because the magicians(practical Kabalists) work surrounded by the light of the primordial serpent, which they perceive in heaven as a luminouszone composed of myriads of small stars\" . . . which means simply the astral light, so called by the Martinists, by EliphasLevi, and now by all the modern Occultists. (Vide Sections about.)-------THE \"CURSE\" FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL POINT OF VIEW.The foregoing teachings of the SECRET DOCTRINE, supplemented by universal traditions, must now have demonstratedthat the Brahmanas and Puranas, the Yathas and other Mazdean Scriptures,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 410 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.down to the Egyptian, Greek, and Roman, and finally to the Jewish Sacred records, all have the same origin. None aremeaningless and baseless stories, invented to entrap the unwary profane: all are allegories intended to convey, under amore or less fantastic veil, the great truths gathered in the same field of pre-historic tradition. Space forbids us fromentering, in these two volumes, into further and more minute details with respect to the four Races which preceded ourown. But before offering to the student the history of the psychic and spiritual evolution of the direct antediluvian fathers ofour Fifth (Aryan) humanity, and before demonstrating its bearing upon all the other side branches grown from the sametrunk, we have to elucidate a few more facts. It has been shown, on the evidence of the whole ancient literary world, andthe intuitional speculations of more than one philosopher and scientist of the later ages, that the tenets of our EsotericDoctrine are corroborated by inferential as well as by direct proof in almost every case. That neither the \"legendary\"giants, nor the lost continents, nor yet the evolution of the preceding races, are quite baseless tales. In the Addendawhich close this volume, science will find itself more than once unable to reply; they will, it is hoped, finally dispose ofevery sceptical remark with regard to the sacred number in nature, and our figures in general. (Vide §§ on theSeptenaries.)Meanwhile, one task is left incomplete: that of disposing of that most pernicious of all the theological dogmas -- theCURSE under which mankind is alleged to have suffered ever since the supposed disobedience of Adam and Eve in thebower of Eden.Creative powers in man were the gift of divine wisdom, not the result of sin. This is clearly instanced in the paradoxicalbehaviour of Jehovah, who first curses Adam and Eve (or Humanity) for the supposed committed crime, and then blesseshis \"chosen people\" by saying \"Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth\" (Gen. ix. 1). The curse was not broughton mankind by the Fourth Race, for the comparatively sinless Third Race, the still more gigantic Antediluvians, hadperished in the same way; hence the Deluge was no punishment, but simply a result of a periodical and geological law.Nor was the curse of KARMA called down upon them for seeking natural union, as all the mindless animal-world does inits proper seasons; but, for abusing the creative power, for desecrating the divine gift, and wasting the life-essence for nopurpose except bestial personal gratification. When understood, the third chapter of Genesis will be found to refer to theAdam and Eve of the closing Third and the commencing Fourth Races. In the beginning, conception was as easy forwoman as it was for all animal creation. Nature had never intended that woman should bring forth her young ones \"insorrow.\" Since that period, however, during the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 411 THE ANCIENT AND THE MODERN MAN.evolution of the Fourth Race, there came enmity between its seed, and the \"Serpent's\" seed, the seed or product ofKarma and divine wisdom. For the seed of woman or lust, bruised the head of the seed of the fruit of wisdom andknowledge, by turning the holy mystery of procreation into animal gratification; hence the law of Karma \"bruised the heel\"of the Atlantean race, by gradually changing physiologically, morally, physically, and mentally, the whole nature of theFourth Race of mankind,* until, from the healthy King of animal creation of the Third Race, man became in the Fifth, our"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"race, a helpless, scrofulous being, and has now become the wealthiest heir on the globe to constitutional and hereditarydiseases, the most consciously and intelligently bestial of all animals!**This is the real CURSE from the physiological standpoint, almost the only one touched upon in the Kabalistic esotericism.Viewed from this aspect, the curse is undeniable, for it is evident. The intellectual evolution, in its progress hand-in-handwith the physical, has certainly been a curse instead of a blessing -- a gift quickened by the \"Lords of Wisdom,\" who havepoured on the human manas the fresh dew of their own spirit and essence. The divine Titan has then suffered in vain;and one feels inclined to regret his benefaction to mankind, and sigh for those days so graphically depicted by AEschylus,in his \"Prometheus Bound,\" when, at the close of the first Titanic age (the age that followed that of ethereal man, of thepious Kandu and Pramlocha), nascent, physical mankind, still mindless and (physiologically) senseless, is described as --\"Seeing, they saw in vain;Hearing, they heard not; but like shapes in dreams,Through the long time all things at random mixed.\"Our Saviours, the Agnishwatta and other divine \"Sons of the Flame of Wisdom\" (personified by the Greeks inPrometheus***), may well, in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* How wise and grand, how far-seeing and morally beneficent are the laws of Manu on connubial life, when comparedwith the licence tacitly allowed to man in civilized countries. That those laws have been neglected for the last twomillenniums does not prevent us from admiring their forethought. The Brahmin was a grihasta, a family man, till a certainperiod of his life, when, after begetting a son, he broke with married life and became a chaste Yogi. His very connubial lifewas regulated by his Brahmin astrologer in accordance with his nature. Therefore, in such countries as the Punjab, forinstance, where the lethal influence of Mussulman, and later on of European, licentiousness, has hardly touched theorthodox Aryan castes, one still finds the finest men -- so far as stature and physical strength go -- on the whole globe;whereas the mighty men of old have found themselves replaced in the Deccan, and especially in Bengal, by men whosegeneration becomes with every century (and almost with every year) dwarfed and weakened.** Diseases and over-population are facts that can never be denied.*** In Mrs. Anna Swanwick's volumes, \"The Dramas of AEschylus,\" it is said of \"Prometheus Bound\" (Vol. II., pp. 146,147), that Prometheus truly appears in it \"as [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 412 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the injustice of the human heart, be left unrecognized and unthanked. They may, in our ignorance of the truth, beindirectly cursed for Pandora's gift: but to find themselves proclaimed and declared by the mouth of the clergy, the EVILONES, is too heavy a Karma for \"Him\" \"who dared alone \"-- when Zeus \"ardently desired\" to quench the entire humanrace -- to save \"that mortal race\" from perdition, or, as the suffering Titan is made to say:--\"From sinking blasted down to Hades' gloom.For this by the dire tortures I am bent,Grievous to suffer, piteous to behold,I who did mortals pity! . . . . \"The chorus remarking very pertinently:--\"Vast boon was this thou gavest unto mortals . . . .\"Prometheus answers:--\"Yea, and besides 'twas I that gave them fire.CHORUS: Have now these short-lived creatures flame-eyed fire?PROM.: Ay, and by it full many arts will learn. . . . . \"But, with the arts, the fire received has turned into the greatest curse: the animal element, and consciousness of itspossession, has changed periodical instinct into chronic animalism and sensuality.* It is this which hangs over humanitylike a heavy funereal pall.

Prometheus represents himself as having frustrated this design, andas being consequently subjected, for the sake of mortals, to the most agonising pain, inflicted by the remorseless crueltyof Zeus. We have, thus, the Titan, the symbol of finite reason and free will (of intellectual humanity, or the higher aspectof Manas), depicted as the sublime philanthropist, while Zeus, the supreme deity of Hellas, is portrayed as the cruel andobdurate despot, a character peculiarly revolting to Athenian sentiment.\" The reason for it is explained further on.

The true theosophist, the pursuer of divine wisdom and worshipper of ABSOLUTEperfection -- the unknown deity which is neither Zeus nor Jehovah -- will demur to such an idea. Pointing to antiquity hewill prove that there never was an original sin, but only an abuse of physical intelligence -- the psychic being guided bythe animal, and both putting out the light of the spiritual. He will say, \"All ye who can read between the lines, study ancientwisdom in the old dramas -- the Indian and the Greek; read carefully the one just mentioned, one enacted on the theatresof Athens 2,400 years ago, namely 'Prometheus Bound' \" The myth belongs to neither Hesiod nor AEschylus; but, asBunsen says, it \"is older than the Hellenes themselves,\" for it belongs, in truth, to the dawn of human consciousness. TheCrucified Titan is the personified symbol of the collective Logos, the \"Host,\" and of the \"Lords of Wisdom\" or theHEAVENLY MAN, who incarnated in Humanity. Moreover, as his name Pro-me-theus, meaning \"he who sees before him\"or futurity, shows* -- in the arts he devised and taught to humanity, psychological insight was not the least. For as hecomplains to the daughters of Oceanos:--\"Of prophecies the various modes I fixed,And among dreams did first discriminateThe truthful vision . . . and mortals guidedTo a mysterious art. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .All arts to mortals from Prometheus came. . .\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* From [[pro metis]] pro metis, \"forethought.\" \"Professor Kuhn,\" we are told in the above-named volumes of \"The Dramasof AEschylus,\" \"considers the name of the Titan to be derived from the Sanskrit word Pramantha, the instrument used forkindling fire. The root mand or manth, implies rotatory motion, and the word manthami (used to denote the process of firekindling) acquired the secondary sense of snatching away; hence we find another word of the same stock, pramatha,signifying theft.\" This is very ingenious, but perhaps not altogether correct; besides, there is a very prosaic element in it.No doubt in physical nature, the higher forms may develop from the lower ones, but it is hardly so in the world of thought.And as we are told that the word manthami passed into the Greek language and became the word manthano, to learn;that is to say, to appropriate knowledge; whence prometheia, fore-knowledge, fore-thought; we may find, in searching, amore poetical origin for the \"fire-bringer\" than that displayed in its Sanskrit origin. The Svastica, the sacred sign and theinstrument for kindling sacred fire, may explain it better. \"Prometheus, the fire-bringer, is the Pramantha personified,\"goes on the author; \"he finds his prototype in the Aryan [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 414 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Leaving for a few pages the main subject, let us pause and see what may be the hidden meaning of this, the mostancient as it is the most suggestive of traditional allegories. As it relates directly to the early races, this will be no realdigression.The subject of AEschylus' drama (the trilogy is lost) is known to all cultured readers. The demi-god robs the gods (theElohim) of their secret -- the mystery of the creative fire. For this sacrilegious attempt he is struck down by KRONOS* anddelivered unto Zeus, the FATHER and creator of a mankind which he would wish to have blind intellectually, and animal-like; a personal deity, which will not see MAN \"like one of us.\" Hence Prometheus, \"the fire and light-giver,\" is chained onMount Caucasus and condemned to suffer torture. But the triform Fates (Karma), whose decrees, as the Titan says, evenZeus:--\"E'en he the fore-ordained cannot escape. . . \"-- ordain that those sufferings will last only to that day when a son of Zeus --\"Ay, a son bearing stronger than his sire\" (787). . . . . . . . . .\"One of thine (Io's) own descendants it must be. .\"(791)-- is born. This \"Son\" will deliver Prometheus (the suffering Humanity) from his own fatal gift. His name is, \"He who has tocome. . . . \"On the authority, then, of these few lines, which, like any other allegorical sentence, may be twisted into almost anymeaning; namely, on the words pronounced by Prometheus and addressed to Io, the daughter of Inachos, persecuted byZeus -- a whole prophecy is constructed by some Catholic writers. Says the crucified Titan:--\"And, portent past belief, the speaking oaks"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"By which full clearly, in no riddling phraseWast hailed as the illustrious spouse of Zeus. . . . . . . . .

Io -- \"is the mother of God,\" we are told, and \"dark Epaphos\" -- Christ. But,the latter has not dethroned his father, except metaphorically, if one has to regard Jehovah as that \"Father\"; nor has theChristian Saviour hurled his Father down into Hades. Prometheus says, in verse 930, that Zeus will be humbled yet; asfor himself:--\" . . . . such marriage he preparesWhich from his throne of power to nothingnessShall hurl him down; so shall be all fulfilledHis father Kronos' curse . . . .. . . . Then let him sitConfiding in his lofty thunder-peals,And wielding with both hands the fiery bolt;For these shall not avail, but fail he shall,A fall disgraceful, not to be endured . . . . \" (v. 980).\"Dark Epaphos\" was the Dionysos-Sabazius, the son of Zeus and of Demeter in the Sabasian Mysteries, during which the\"father of the gods,\" assuming the shape of a Serpent, begot on Demeter, Dionysos, or the solar Bacchus. Io is the moon,and at the same time the EVE of a new race, and so is Demeter -- in the present case. The Promethean myth is aprophecy indeed; but it does not relate to any of the cyclic Saviours who have appeared periodically in various countriesand among various nations, in their transitionary conditions of evolution. It points to the last of the mysteries of cyclictransformations, in the series of which mankind, having passed from the ethereal to the solid physical state, from spiritualto physiological procreation, is now carried onward on the opposite arc of the cycle, toward that second phase of itsprimitive state, when woman knew no man, and human progeny was created, not begotten.That state will return to it and to the world at large, when the latter shall discover and really appreciate the truths whichunderlie this vast problem of sex. It will be like \"the light that never shone on sea or land,\" and has to come to menthrough the Theosophical Society. That light will lead on and up to the true spiritual intuition. Then (as expressed once ina letter to a theosophist), \"the world will have a race of Buddhas and Christs, for the world will have discovered thatindividuals have it in their own powers to procreate Buddha-like children -- or demons.\" \"When that knowledge comes, alldogmatic religions, and with these the demons, will die out.\"If we reflect upon the serial development of the allegory, and the character of the heroes, the mystery may be unriddled.KRONOS is of course \"time\" in its cyclic course. He swallows his children -- the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See, for explanation of this curse, the last page of the present sub-section.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 416 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.personal gods of exoteric dogmas included. He has swallowed instead of Zeus, his stone idol; but the symbol has grown,and has only developed in human fancy as mankind was cycling down toward only its physical and intellectual -- notspiritual -- perfection. When it is as far advanced in its spiritual evolution Kronos will be no longer deceived. Instead of thestone image he will have swallowed the anthropomorphic fiction itself. Because, the serpent of wisdom, represented inthe Sabasian mysteries by the anthropomorphised Logos, the unity of spiritual and physical Powers, will have begotten inTime (Kronos) a progeny -- Dionysos-Bacchus or the \"dark Epaphos,\" the \"mighty one\" -- the race that will overthrow him.Where will he be born? Prometheus traces him to his origin and birth-place in his prophecy to Io. Io is the moon-goddessof generation -- for she is Isis and she is Eve, the great mother.* He traces the path of the (racial) wanderings as plainlyas words can express it. She has to quit Europe and go to Asia's continent, reaching there the highest of the mountains ofCaucasus (737), the Titan telling her:--\"When thou hast crossed the flood, limit betwixtTwo continents, fronting the burning East.\" (810)"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"that she must travel eastward, after passing the \"Kimmerian Bosphorus,\" and cross what is evidently the Volga and nowAstrakhan on the Caspian Sea.

There may be good reason for it.First of all it is the journey and wandering from place to place of the race from which the \"tenth,\" or Kalki Avatar, so called,is to issue. This he calls the \"Kingly race born in Argos\" (888). But Argos has no reference here to Argos in Greece. Itcomes from Arg or arca -- the female generative power symbolised in the moon -- the navi-formed Argha of the mysteries,meaning the Queen of Heaven. Eustathius shows that, in the dialect of the Arg-ians, Io signified the moon; whileesotericism explains it as the divine Androgyne, or the mystic 10; in Hebrew 10 is the perfect number, or Jehovah. Arghyain Sanskrit is the libation cup, the navi-form or boat-shaped vessel in which flowers and fruit are offered to the deities.Arghyanath is a title of the Maha-Chohan, meaning \"the Lord of Libations;\" and Arghya Varsha -- \"the land of libations\" --is the mystery name of that region which extends from Kailas mountain nearly to the Schamo Desert -- from within whichthe Kalki Avatar is expected. The Airyana-Varsedya of the Zoroastrians, as a locality, is identical with it. It is now said tohave been situated between the sea of Aral, Baltistan, and little Tibet; but in olden times its area was far larger, as it wasthe birth-place of physical humanity, of which Io is the mother and symbol.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 417 THE MISTAKE OF ARRIAN EXPLAINED.Ural, the Arimaspi of Herodotus being \"the recognised inhabitants of this golden region.\"And here comes, between verses 825 and 835, a puzzle to all the European interpreters. Says the Titan:--\"To these (Arimaspi and Grypes) approach not; a far border landThou next wilt reach, where dwells a swarthy raceNear the Sun's founts, where is the AEthiop \"river\";Along its banks proceed till thou attainThe mighty rapids, where from Bybline heightsPure draughts of sacred water Neilos sends . . . \"There Io was ordained to found a colony for herself and sons. Now we must see how the passage is interpreted. As Io istold that she has to travel eastward till she comes to the river Ethiops, which she is to follow till it falls into the Nile --hence the perplexity. \"According to the geographical theories of the earliest Greeks\" we are informed by the author of theversion on \"Prometheus Bound\" --\"This condition was fulfilled by the river Indus. Arrian (vi. i.) mentions that Alexander the Great, when preparing to saildown the Indus (having seen crocodiles in the river Indus, and in no other river except the Nile . . . ), seemed to himself tohave discovered the sources of the Nile, as though the Nile, rising from some place in India, and flowing through muchdesert land, and thereby losing its name Indus, next . . . flowed through inhabited land, being now called the Nile by theEthiopians of those parts and afterwards by the Egyptians. Virgil in the 4th Georgic echoes the absolute error\" (p. 197,Vol. II.).Both Alexander and Virgil may have erred considerably in their geographical notions; but the prophecy of Prometheushas not so sinned, in the least -- not, at any rate, in its esoteric spirit. When a certain race is symbolised, and eventspertaining to its history are rendered allegorically, no topographical accuracy ought to be expected in the itinerary tracedfor its personification. Yet it so happens, that the river \"Ethiops\" is certainly the Indus, and it is also the Nil or Nila. It is theriver born on the Kailas (heaven) mountain, the mansion of the gods -- 22,000 feet above the level of the sea. It was theEthiops river -- and was so called by the Greeks, long before the days of Alexander, because its banks, from Attock downto Sind, were peopled by tribes generally referred to as the Eastern Ethiopians. India and Egypt were two kindred nations,and the Eastern Ethiopians -- the mighty builders -- have come from India, as is pretty well proved, it is hoped, in \"ISISUNVEILED.\" (Vol. I. p. 569-70).Then why could not Alexander, and even the learned Virgil have used the word Nile or Neilos when speaking of theIndus, since it is one of its names? To this day that river is called, in the regions around Kala-Bagh, nil (blue), and Nilah,\"the blue river.\" The water here is of such dark blue colour that the name given to it from time immemorial led to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 418 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.a small town on its banks being called by the same name. It exists to this day. Evidently Arrian -- who wrote far later thanthe day of Alexander, and who was ignorant of the old name of the Indus -- has unconsciously slandered the Greekconqueror. Nor are our modern historians much wiser, in judging as they do. For they often make the most sweepingdeclarations on mere appearances, as much as their ancient colleagues ever did in days of old, when no Encyclopaediaswere yet ready for them.The race of IO, \"the cow-horned maid\" is then simply the first pioneer race of the AEthiopians brought by her from theIndus to the Nile (which received its name in memory of the mother river of the colonists from India*). For does notPrometheus say to Io** that the sacred Neilos (the god, not the river) --"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":". . . \"He to the land, three-cornered, thee shall guide,\" -- namely, to the Delta, where her sons are foreordained to found --. . . . . \"that far-off colony . . .\" (v. 830 et seq.).It is there that a new race (the Egyptians) will begin, and a \"female race\" (873) which, \"fifth in descent\" from dark Epaphos--\"Fifty in number shall return to Argos.\"Then one of the fifty virgins will fail through love and shall -- . . .A kingly race in Argos bear. . . . . . . .But from this seed shall dauntless heroes spring,Bow-famous, who shall free me from these ills.\"When this hero shall arise, the Titan does not reveal; for as he remarks:--\"This, to set forth at large needs lengthy speech.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Alexander, who was better acquainted with Attock than with India (where he never went) could not have failed to hearthe Indus near its very sources called Nil and Nilah. Even if a mistake, it is thus easily accounted for.** That Io is identical allegorically with Isis and the moon is shown by her being \"cow-horned.\" The allegory undeniablyreached Greece from India, where Vach -- \"the melodious cow\" (Rig-Veda) \"from whom mankind was produced\"(Bhagavata Purana) is shown in the Aitareya Brahmana as pursued by her father Brahma, who was moved by an illicitpassion, and changed her into a deer. Hence Io, refusing to yield to Jupiter's passion, becomes \"horned.\" The cow was inevery country the symbol of the passive generative power of nature, Isis, Vach, Venus -- the mother of the prolific god oflove, Cupid, but, at the same time, that of the Logos whose symbol became with the Egyptians and the Indians -- the bull-- as testified to by Apis and the Hindu bulls in the most ancient temples. In esoteric philosophy the cow is the symbol ofcreative nature, and the Bull (her calf) the spirit which vivifies her, or \"the Holy Spirit,\" as Mr. Kenealy shows. Hence thesymbol of the horns. These were sacred also with the Jews, who placed near the altar horns of Shittim wood, by seizingwhich a criminal ensured his safety.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 419 WAS AESCHYLUS INITIATED?But \"Argos\" is Arghya Varsha, the land of libation of the old Hierophants, whence the deliverer of Humanity will appear, aname which became ages later that of its neighbour, India -- the Arya-varta of old.That the subject formed part of the Sabasian mysteries is made known by several ancient writers: by Cicero (in Tuscul.Quaest. I, ii. No. 20) and by Clemens Alexandrinus (Strom. I, ii., oper. tom. 1, p. 467 -- Ed. Potter's). The latter writers arethe only ones who attribute the fact that AEschylus was charged by the Athenians with sacrilege and condemned to bestoned to death, to its true cause. They say that having been himself uninitiated, AEschylus had profaned the Mysteriesby exposing them in his trilogies on a public stage.* But he would have incurred the same condemnation had he beeninitiated -- which must have been the case, as otherwise he must, like Socrates, have had a daimon to reveal to him thesecret and sacred allegorical drama of initiation. At all events, it is not the \"father of the Greek tragedy\" who invented theprophecy of Prometheus; for he only repeated in dramatic form that which was revealed by the priests during theMYSTERIA of the Sabasia.** The latter, however, is one of the oldest sacred festivals, whose origin is to this dayunknown to history. Mythologists connect it through Mithras (the Sun, called Sabasius on some old monuments) withJupiter and Bacchus. But it was never the property of the Greeks, but dates from days immemorial.The translators of the drama wonder how AEschylus could become guilty of such \"discrepancy between the character ofZeus as portrayed in the 'Prometheus Bound' and that depicted in the remaining dramas.\" (Mrs. A. Swanwick.) This is justbecause AEschylus, like Shakespeare, was and will ever remain the intellectual \"Sphinx\" of the ages. Between Zeus, theabstract deity of Grecian thought, and the Olympic Zeus, there was an abyss. The latter represented during the mysteriesno higher a principle than the lower aspect of human physical intelligence -- Manas wedded to Kama; Prometheus -- itsdivine aspect merging into and aspiring to Buddhi -- the divine Soul. Zeus was the human soul and nothing more,whenever shown yielding to his lower passions, -- the jealous God, revengeful and cruel in its egotism or I-AM-NESS.Hence, Zeus is represented as a serpent -- the intellectual tempter of man -- which, nevertheless, begets in the course of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Herodotus and Pausanias supposed that the cause of the condemnation was that AEschylus, adopting the theogony ofthe Egyptians, made Diana, the daughter of Ceres, and not of Latona.

But AEschyIus was initiated.** Sabasia was a periodical festival with mysteries enacted in honour of some gods, a variant on the Mithraic Mysteries.The whole evolution of the races was performed in them.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 420 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.cyclic evolution the \"Man-Saviour,\" the solar Bacchus or \"Dionysos,\" more than a man.Dionysos is one with Osiris, with Krishna, and with Buddha (the heavenly wise), and with the coming (tenth) Avatar, theglorified Spiritual Christos, who will deliver the suffering Christos (mankind, or Prometheus, on its trial).

Then will Brahma, the Hindu deity; Ahura-Mazda (Ormazd), the Zoroastrian; Zeus, theGreco-Olympian Don Juan; Jehovah, the jealous, repenting, cruel, tribal God of the Israelites, and all their likes in theuniversal Pantheon of human fancy -- vanish and disappear in thin air. And along with these will vanish their shadows, thedark aspects of all those deities, ever represented as their \"twin brothers\" and creatures, in exoteric legend, their ownreflection on earth -- in esoteric philosophy. The Ahrimans and Typhons, the Samaels and Satans, must be all dethronedon that day, when every dark evil passion will be subdued.There is one eternal Law in nature, one that always tends to adjust contraries and to produce final harmony. It is owing tothis law of spiritual development superseding the physical and purely intellectual, that mankind will become freed from itsfalse gods, and find itself finally -- SELF-REDEEMED.In its final revelation, the old myth of Prometheus -- his proto- and anti-types being found in every ancient theogony --stands in each of them at the very origin of physical evil, because at the threshold of human physical life. KRONOS is\"Time,\" whose first law is that the order of the successive and harmonious phases in the process of evolution duringcyclic development should be strictly preserved -- under the severe penalty of abnormal growth with all its ensuingresults. It was not in the programme of natural development that man -- higher animal though he may be -- shouldbecome at once -- intellectually, spiritually, and psychically -- the demi-god he is on earth, while his physical frameremains weaker and more helpless and ephemeral than that of almost any huge mammal. The contrast is too grotesqueand violent; the tabernacle much too unworthy of its indwelling god. The gift of Prometheus thus became a CURSE --though foreknown and foreseen by the HOST personified in that personage, as his name well shows.* It is in this thatrests, at one and the same time,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide supra, a foot-note concerning the etymology of [[prometis]] prometis or forethought. Prometheus confesses it in thedrama when saying:-- [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 421 ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF ZEUS.its sin and its redemption. For the Host that incarnated in a portion of humanity, though led to it by Karma or Nemesis,preferred free-will to passive slavery, intellectual self-conscious pain and even torture \"while myriad time shall flow\" -- toinane, imbecile, instinctual beatitude. Knowing such an incarnation was premature and not in the programme of nature,the heavenly host, \"Prometheus,\" still sacrificed itself to benefit thereby, at least, one portion of mankind.* But whilesaving man from mental darkness, they inflicted upon him the tortures of the self-consciousness of his responsibility -- theresult of his free will -- besides every ill to which mortal man and flesh are heir to. This torture Prometheus accepted forhimself, since the Host became henceforward blended with the tabernacle prepared for them, which was still unachievedat that period of formation.Spiritual evolution being incapable of keeping pace with the physical, once its homogeneity was broken by the admixture,the gift thus became the chief cause, if not the sole origin of Evil.** The allegory which shows KRONOS cursing Zeus fordethroning him (in the primitive \"golden\" age of Saturn, when all men were demi-gods), and for creating a physical race ofmen weak and helpless in comparison; and then as delivering to his (Zeus') revenge the culprit, who despoiled the godsof their prerogative of creation and who thereby raised man to their level, intellectually and spiritually -- is highlyphilosophical. In the case of Prometheus, Zeus represents the Host of the primeval progenitors, of the PITAR, the\"Fathers\" who created man senseless[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]]\"Oh! holy Ether, swiftly-winged gales . . . .Behold what I, a god, from gods endure. . . . . . . . .And yet what say I?

The intellectual difference between theAryan and other civilized nations and such savages as the South Sea Islanders, is inexplicable on any other grounds. Noamount of culture, nor generations of training amid civilization, could raise such human specimens as the Bushmen, theVeddhas of Ceylon, and some African tribes, to the same intellectual level as the Aryans, the Semites, and the Turaniansso called. The \"sacred spark\" is missing in them and it is they who are the only inferior races on the globe, now happily --owing to the wise adjustment of nature which ever works in that direction -- fast dying out. Verily mankind is \"of oneblood,\" but not of the same essence. We are the hot-house, artificially quickened plants in nature, having in us a spark,which in them is latent.** The philosophical view of Indian metaphysics places the Root of Evil in the differentiation of the Homogeneous into theHeterogeneous, of the unit into plurality.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 422 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"and without any mind; while the divine Titan stands for the Spiritual creators, the devas who \"fell\" into generation.

They (the inferior \"Host\") were masters of all the Cosmic and lower titanic forces; the higher Titan possessed onlythe intellectual and spiritual fire. This drama of the struggle of Prometheus with the Olympic tyrant and despot, sensualZeus, one sees enacted daily within our actual mankind: the lower passions chain the higher aspirations to the rock ofmatter, to generate in many a case the vulture of sorrow, pain, and repentance. In every such case one sees once more --\"A god . . . in fetters, anguish fraught;The foe of Zeus, in hatred held by all. . . . \"A god, bereft even of that supreme consolation of Prometheus, who suffered in self-sacrifice --\"For that to men he bare too fond a mind. . .\"as the divine Titan is moved by altruism, but the mortal man by Selfishness and Egoism in every instance.The modern Prometheus has now become Epi-metheus, \"he who sees only after the event\"; because the universalphilanthropy of the former has long ago degenerated into selfishness and self-adoration. Man will rebecome the free Titanof old, but not before cyclic evolution has re-established the broken harmony between the two natures -- the terrestrialand the divine; after which he becomes impermeable to the lower titanic forces, invulnerable in his personality, andimmortal in his individuality, which cannot happen before every animal element is eliminated from his nature. When manunderstands that \"Deus non fecit mortem\" (Sap. I., 13), but that man has created it himself, he will re-become thePrometheus before his Fall.For the full symbolism of Prometheus and the origin of this mythos in Greece, the reader is referred to Part II. of thisVolume, chapter \"A Second Key to Prometheus,\" etc. In the said Part -- a kind of supplement to the present portion --every additional information is given upon those tenets that will be the most controverted and questioned.

Each MS. has appended to it a short synopsis of the history ofthat sub-race to which the particular \"Buddha-Lha\" belonged. The one special MS. from which the fragments which followare extracted, and then rendered into a more comprehensible language, is said to have been copied from stone tabletswhich belonged to a Buddha of the earliest day of the Fifth Race, who had witnessed the Deluge and the submersion ofthe chief continents of the Atlantean race. The day when much, if not all, of that which is given here from the archaicrecords, will be found correct, is not far distant. Then the modern symbologists will acquire the certitude that even Odin,or the god Woden, the highest god in the German and Scandinavian mythology, is one of these thirty-five Buddhas; oneof the earliest, indeed, for the continent to which he and his race belonged, is also one of the earliest.

Events which were never written outside the human memory,but which were religiously transmitted from one generation to another, and from race to race, may have been preservedby constant transmission \"within the book volume of the brain,\" and through countless aeons, with more truth andaccuracy than inside any written document or record. \"That which is part of our souls is eternal,\" says Thackeray; andwhat can be nearer to our souls than that which happens at the dawns of our lives?

There is no doubt that America is that\"far distant land into which pious men and heavy storms had transferred the sacred doctrine,\" as a Chinese writersuggested by his description to Neumann. But neither Professor Holmboe, of Stockholm, nor the Americanarchaeologists, have guessed the right age of the mounds, or the tumuli. The fact that Norwegians may have re-discovered the land that their long-forgotten forefathers believed to have perished in the general submersion, does notconflict with that other fact that the Secret Doctrine of the land which was the cradle of physical man, and of the FifthRace, had found its way into the so-called New World ages and ages before the \"Sacred Doctrine\" of Buddhism.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 425 THE OLDEST RECORDS ABOUT ATLANTIS.The \"Kings of Light\" is the name given in all old records to the Sovereigns of the divine Dynasties. The \"azure seats\" aretranslated \"celestial thrones\" in certain documents. The \"flower of power\" is now the Lotus; what it may have been at thatperiod, who can tell.The writer proceeds, like the later Jeremiah, to bewail the fate of his people. They had become bereft of their \"azure\"(celestial) kings, and \"they of the Deva hue,\" the moon-like complexion, and \"they of the refulgent (golden) face\" havegone \"to the land of bliss, the land of metal and fire\"; or -- agreeably with the rules of symbolism -- to the lands lying Northand East, from whence \"the great waters have been swept away, sucked in by the earth and dissipated in the air.\" Thewise races had perceived \"the black storm-dragons, called down by the dragons of wisdom\" -- and \"had fled, led on bythe shining Protectors of the most Excellent Land\" -- the great ancient adepts, presumably; those the Hindus refer to astheir Manus and Rishis. One of them was Vaivasvata Manu.They \"of the yellow hue\" are the forefathers of those whom Ethnology now classes as the Turanians, the Mongols,Chinese and other ancient nations; and the land they fled to was no other than Central Asia. There entire new races wereborn; there they lived and died until the separation of the nations. But this \"separation\" did not take place either in thelocalities assigned for it by modern science, nor in the way the Aryans are shown to have divided and separated by Mr.Max Muller and other Aryanists. Nearly two-thirds of one million years have elapsed since that period. The yellow-facedgiants of the post-Atlantean day, had ample time, throughout this forced confinement to one part of the world, and withthe same racial blood and without any fresh infusion or admixture in it, to branch off during a period of nearly 700,000years into the most heterogeneous and diversified types. The same is shown in Africa; nowhere does a moreextraordinary variability of types exist, from black to almost white, from gigantic men to dwarfish races; and this onlybecause of their forced isolation. The Africans have never left their continent for several hundred thousands of years. Ifto-morrow the continent of Europe were to disappear and other lands to re-emerge instead; and if the African tribes wereto separate and scatter on the face of the earth, it is they who, in about a hundred thousand years hence, would form thebulk of the civilized nations. And it is the descendants of those of our highly cultured nations, who might have survived onsome one island, without any means of crossing the new seas, that would fall back into a state of relative savagery. Thusthe reason given for dividing humanity into superior and inferior races falls to the ground and becomes a fallacy.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 426 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Such are the statements made and facts given in the archaic records. Collating and comparing them with some moderntheories of Evolution, minus natural selection (Vide \"Physiological Selection\" by G. J. Romanes, F.R.S.), thesestatements appear quite reasonable and logical.* Thus, while the Aryans are the descendants of the yellow Adams, thegigantic and highly civilized tlanto-Aryan race, the Semites -- and the Jews along with them -- are those of the red Adam;and both de Quatrefages and the writers of the Mosaic Genesis are right. For, could chapter v. of the First Book of Mosesbe compared with the genealogies found in our Archaic Bible, the period from Adam unto Noah would be found noticedtherein, of course under different names, the respective years of the Patriarchs being turned into periods, the whole beingshown symbolical and allegorical. In the MS. under consideration many and frequent are the references to the greatknowledge and civilization of the Atlantean nations, showing the polity of several of them and the nature of their arts andsciences. If the Third Root-Race, the Lemuro-Atlanteans, are already spoken of as having been drowned \"with their highcivilizations and gods\" (\"Esoteric Buddhism,\" p. 65), how much more may the same be said of the Atlanteans!It is from the Fourth Race that the early Aryans got their knowledge of \"the bundle of wonderful things,\" the Sabha andMayasabha, mentioned in the Mahabharata, the gift of Mayasur to the Pandavas. It is from them that they learntaeronautics, Viwan Vidya (the \"knowledge of flying in air-vehicles\"), and, therefore, their great arts of meteorography and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"meteorology. It is from them, again, that the Aryans inherited their most valuable science of the hidden virtues of preciousand other stones, of chemistry, or rather alchemy, of mineralogy, geology, physics and astronomy.Several times the writer has put to herself the question: \"Is the story of Exodus -- in its details at least -- as narrated in theOld Testament, original?

The anger of \"God\" at the obduracy of Pharaoh, his command to the \"chosen\" ones, to spoil theEgyptians, before departing, of their \"jewels of silver and jewels of gold\" (Exod. xi.); and finally the Egyptians and theirPharaoh drowned in the Red Sea (xiv.).

Arise ye men of the good law, and cross the land while (yet) dry.''The Lords of the storm are approaching. Their chariots are nearing the land. One night and two days only shall the Lordsof the Dark Face (the Sorcerers) live on this patient land. She is doomed, and they have to descend with her. The netherLords of the Fires (the Gnomes and fire Elementals) are preparing their magic Agneyastra (fire-weapons worked bymagic). But the Lords of the Dark Eye (\"Evil Eye\") are stronger than they (the Elementals) and they are the slaves of themighty ones. They are versed in Ashtar (Vidya, the highest magical knowledge).* Come and use yours (i.e., your magicpowers, in order to counteract those of the Sorcerers). Let every lord of the Dazzling Face (an adept of the White Magic)cause the Viwan of every lord of the Dark Face to come into his hands (or possession), lest any (of the Sorcerers) shouldby its means escape from the waters, avoid the rod of the Four, (Karmic deities) and save his wicked' (followers, orpeople).'May every yellow face send sleep from himself (mesmerize?) to every black face.

One more statement has to be made: There havebeen several Divine Dynasties -- a series for every Root Race beginning with the Third, each series according andadapted to its Humanity. The last Seven Dynasties referred to in the Egyptian and Chaldean records belong to the FifthRace, which, though generally called Aryan, was not entirely so, as it was ever largely mixed up with races to whichEthnology gives other names. It would be impossible, in view of the limited space at our disposal, to go any further intothe description of the Atlanteans, in whom the whole East believes as much as we believe in the ancient Egyptians, butwhose existence the majority of the Western Scientists deny, as they have denied, before this, many a truth, from theexistence of Homer down to that of the carrier pigeon. The civilization of the Atlanteans was greater even than that of theEgyptians. It is their degenerate descendants, the nation of Plato's Atlantis, which built the first Pyramids in the country,and that certainly before the advent of the \"Eastern AEthiopians,\" as Herodotus calls the Egyptians. This may be wellinferred from the statement made by Ammianus Marcellinus, who says of the Pyramids that \"there are also subterraneanpassages and winding retreats, which, it is said, men skilful in the ancient mysteries, by means of which they divined thecoming of a flood, constructed in different places lest the memory of all their sacred ceremonies should be lost.\"These men who \"divined the coming of floods\" were not Egyptians, who never had any, except the periodical rising of theNile. Who were they? The last remnants of the Atlanteans, we maintain. Those races which are dimly suspected byScience, and thinking of which Mr. Ch. Gould, the well-known geologist, says: \"Can we suppose that we have at allexhausted the great museum of nature? Have we, in fact, penetrated yet beyond its antechambers? Does the writtenhistory of man, comprising a few thousand years, embrace the whole course of his intelligent existence? Or have we inthe long mythical eras, extending over hundreds of thousands of years, and recorded in the chronologies of Chaldea andof China, shadowy mementos of pre-historic man, handed down by tradition, and perhaps transported by a few survivorsto existing lands from others, which, like the fabled (?) Atlantis of Plato, may have been submerged, or the scene of somegreat catastrophe which destroyed them with all their civilization\" (\"Mythical Monsters,\" p. 19).After this one can turn with more confidence to the words of a Master who wrote, several years before these words werepenned by Mr. Gould:-- \"The Fourth Race had its periods of the highest civilization. Greek and Roman and even Egyptiancivilizations are nothing com-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 430 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.pared to the civilizations that began with the Third Race\" -- after its separation.But if this civilization and the mastery of arts and sciences are denied to the Third and Fourth Races, no one will denythat between the great civilizations of antiquity, such as those of Egypt and India, there stretched the dark ages of crassignorance and barbarism ever since the beginning of the Christian era up to our modern civilization; during which periodall recollection of these traditions was lost. As said in Isis Unveiled: \"Why should we forget that, ages before the prow ofthe adventurous Genoese clove the Western waters, the Phoenician vessels had circumnavigated the globe, and spreadcivilization in regions now silent and deserted? What archaeologist will dare assert that the same hand which planned thePyramids of Egypt, Karnak, and the thousand ruins now crumbling to oblivion on the sandy banks of the Nile, did noterect the monumental Nagkon-Wat of Cambodia? or trace the hieroglyphics on the obelisks and doors of the desertedIndian village, newly discovered in British Columbia by Lord Dufferin? or those on the ruins of Palenque and Uxmal, ofCentral America? Do not the relics we treasure in our museums -- last mementos of the long 'lost arts' -- speak loudly infavour of ancient civilization? And do they not prove, over and over again, that nations and continents that have passedaway have buried along with them arts and sciences, which neither the first crucible ever heated in a mediaeval cloister,nor the last cracked by a modern chemist, have revived, nor will -- at least, in the present century.\"And the same question may be put now that was put then; it may be once more asked: \"How does it happen that themost advanced standpoint that has been reached in our times, only enables us to see in the dim distance up the Alpine"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"path of knowledge the monumental proofs that earlier explorers have left to mark the plateaux they had reached andoccupied?\"If modern masters are so much in advance of the old ones, why do they not restore to us the lost arts of our postdiluvianforefathers?

The more archeology and philology advance, themore humiliating to our pride are the discoveries which are daily made, the more glorious testimony do they bear in behalfof those who, perhaps on account of the distance of their remote antiquity, have been until now considered ignorantflounderers in the deepest mire of superstition.\"Among other arts and sciences, the ancients -- ay, as a heirloom from the Atlanteans -- had those of astronomy andsymbolism, which included the knowledge of the Zodiac.As already explained, the whole of antiquity believed, with good reason, that humanity and its races are all intimatelyconnected with the planets, and these with Zodiacal signs. The whole world's History is recorded in the latter. In theancient temples of Egypt this was proved by the Dendera Zodiac; but except in an Arabic work, the property of a Sufi, thewriter has never met with a correct copy of these marvellous records of the past, as also of the future, history of ourglobe. Yet the original records exist, most undeniably.As Europeans are unacquainted with the real Zodiacs of India, nor do they understand those they happen to know(witness Bentley), the reader is advised, in order to verify the statement, to turn to the work of Denon (Travels in Egypt,Vol. II.) in which, if understood, the two famous Egyptian Zodiacs, can be found and examined. Having seen thempersonally, the writer has no longer need to trust to what other students -- who have examined and studied both verycarefully - have to say of them. As asserted by the Egyptian Priests to Herodotus, who was informed that the terrestrialPole and the Pole of the Ecliptic had formerly coincided, thus was it found and corroborated by Mackey.* For he statesthat the Poles are represented on the Zodiacs in both positions, \"And in that which shows the Poles (polar axes) at rightangles, there are marks which prove that 'it was not the last time they were in that position; but the first' -- after theZodiacs had been traced.\" \"Capricorn,\" he adds, \"is represented at the North Pole, and Cancer is divided, near its middle,at the South Pole; which is a confirmation that originally they had their winter when the Sun was in Cancer; but the chiefcharacteristics of its being a monument commemorating the first time that the Pole had been in that position, are the Lionand the Virgin.\" (See in Part II., §\"A Mystery of the Zodiac.\")Broadly calculated, it is believed by the Egyptologists that the great Pyramid was built 3,350 B.C. (See Proctor,Knowledge, Vol. I. pp. 242, 400); and that Menes and his Dynasty existed 7 50 years before the Fourth[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The Mythological Astronomy of the Ancients Demonstrated\" by a strangely intuitional symbologist and astronomer, akind of a self-made adept of Norwich, who lived in the first quarter of this century.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 432 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Dynasty (supposed to have built the Pyramids) had appeared (\"The Great Pyramid,\" Staniland Wake). Thus 4,100 yearsB.C. is the age assigned to Menes. Now Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson's declaration that \"all the facts lead to the conclusionthat the Egyptians had already made very great progress in the arts of civilization before the age of Menes, and perhapsbefore they immigrated into the valley of the Nile\" (Rawlinson's \"Herodotus,\" vol. ii. p. 345) is very suggestive, asdestroying this hypothesis. It points to great civilization in prehistoric times, and a still greater antiquity. The Schesoo-Hor(\"the servants of Horus\") were the people who had settled in Egypt; and, as M. G. Maspero affirms, it is to this prehistoricrace that \"belongs the honour . . . of having founded the principal cities of Egypt, and established the most importantsanctuaries.\" This was before the great Pyramid epoch, and when Egypt had hardly arisen from the waters. Yet \"theypossessed the hieroglyphic form of writing special to the Egyptians, and must have been already considerably advancedin civilization.\" It was, says Lenormant, \"the country of the great prehistoric sanctuaries, seats of the sacerdotal dominion,which played the most important part in the origin of civilization.\" What is the date assigned to this people? We hear of4,000, at the utmost of 5,000 years B.C. (Maspero). Now it is claimed that it is by means of the cycle of 25,868 years (theSidereal year) that the approximate year of the erection of the Great Pyramid can be ascertained. \"Assuming that the longnarrow downward passage was directed towards the pole star of the pyramid builders, astronomers have shown that . . . .Alpha Draconis, the then pole-star, was in the required position about 3,350 B.C., as well as in 2,170 B.C. (Proctor,quoted by Staniland Wake.) But we are also told that \"this relative position of Alpha Draconis and Alcyone being anextraordinary one . . it could not occur again for a whole sidereal year\" (ibid). This demonstrates that, since the DenderaZodiac shows the passage of three sidereal years, the great Pyramid must have been built 78,000 years ago, or in anycase that this possibility deserves to be accepted at least as readily as the later date of 3,350 B.C.Now on the Zodiac of a certain temple in far Northern India, as on the Dendera Zodiac, the same characteristics of thesigns are found. Those who know well the Hindu symbols and constellations, will be able to find out by the description ofthe Egyptian, whether the indications of the chronological time are correct or not. On the Dendera Zodiac as preserved bythe modern Egyptian Coptic and Greek adepts, and explained a little differently by Mackey, the Lion stands upon theHydra and his tail is almost straight, pointing downwards at an angle of forty or fifty degrees, this position agreeing withthe original conformation of these constellations. \"But in many places we see the Lion (Simha),\""},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 433 THEORIES OF A SELF-MADE ADEPT.Mackey adds, \"with his tail turned up over his back, and ending with a Serpent's head; thereby showing that the Lion hadbeen 'inverted'; which, indeed, must have been the case with the whole Zodiac and every other Constellation, when thePole had been inverted.\"Speaking of the Circular Zodiac, given also by Denon, he says:-- There, \"the Lion is standing on the Serpent, and his tailforming a curve downward, from which it is found that though six or seven hundred thousand years must have passedbetween the two positions, yet they had made but little difference between in the constellations of Leo and the Hydra;while Virgo is represented very differently in the two. In the circular Zodiac, the Virgin is nursing her child; but it seemsthat they had not had that idea when the pole was first within the plane of the Ecliptic; for in this Zodiac, as given byDenon, we see three Virgins between the Lion and the Scales, the last of which holds in her hand an ear of wheat. It ismuch to be lamented that there is in this Zodiac a breach of the figure in the latter part of Leo and the beginning of Virgowhich has taken away one Decan out of each sign.\"Nevertheless, the meaning is plain, as the three Zodiacs belong to three different epochs: namely, to the last three familyraces of the fourth Sub-race of the Fifth Root-race, each of which must have lived approximately from 25 to 30,000 years.The first of these (the \"Aryan-Asiatics\") witnessed the doom of the last of the populations of the \"giant Atlanteans\"* whoperished some 850,000 years ago (the Ruta and Daitya Island-Continents) toward the close of the Miocene Age.** Thefourth sub-race witnessed the destruction of the last remnant of the Atlanteans -- the Aryo-Atlanteans in the last island ofAtlantis, namely, some 11,000 years ago. In order to understand this the reader[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The term \"Atlantean\" must not mislead the reader to regard these as one race only, or even a nation. It is as though onesaid \"Asiatics.\" Many, multityped, and various were the Atlanteans, who represented several humanities, and almost acountless number of races and nations, more varied indeed than would be the \"Europeans\" were this name to be givenindiscriminately to the five existing parts of the world; which, at the rate colonization is proceeding, will be the case,perhaps, in less than two or three hundred years. There were brown, red, yellow, white and black Atlanteans; giants anddwarfs (as some African tribes comparatively are, even now).** Says a teacher in \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" on p. 64: \"In the Eocene age, even in its very first part, the great cycle of thefourth race men the (Lemuro) Atlanteans had already reached its highest point (of civilization), and the great continent,the father of nearly all the present continents, showed the first symptoms of sinking. . . .\" And on page 70, it is shown thatAtlantis as a whole perished during the Miocene period. To show how the continents, races, nations and cycles overlapeach other, one has but to think of Lemuria, the last of whose lands perished about 700,000 years before the beginning ofthe Tertiary period (see p. 65 of the same work), and the last of \"Atlantis\" only 11,000 years ago; thus both overlapping --one the Atlantean period, and the other the Aryan.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 434 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.is asked to glance at the diagram of the genealogical tree of the Fifth Root-Race -- generally, though hardly correctly,called the Aryan race, and the explanations appended to it.Let the reader remember well that which is said of the divisions of Root Races and the evolution of Humanity in this work,and stated clearly and concisely in Mr. Sinnett's \"Esoteric Buddhism.\"1. There are seven ROUNDS in every manvantara; this one is the Fourth, and we are in the Fifth Root-Race, at present.2. Each Root-Race has seven sub-races.3. Each sub-race has, in its turn, seven ramifications, which may be called Branch or \"Family\" races.4. The little tribes, shoots, and offshoots of the last-named are countless and depend on Karmic action. Examine the\"genealogical tree\" hereto appended, and you will understand. The illustration is purely diagrammatic, and is onlyintended to assist the reader in obtaining a slight grasp of the subject, amidst the confusion which exists between theterms which have been used at different times for the divisions of Humanity. It is also here attempted to express in figures-- but only within approximate limits, for the sake of comparison -- the duration of time through which it is possible todefinitely distinguish one division from another. It would only lead to hopeless confusion if any attempt were made to giveaccurate dates to a few; for the Races, Sub-Races, etc., etc., down to their smallest ramifications, overlap and areentangled with each other until it is nearly impossible to separate them.The human Race has been compared to a tree, and this serves admirably as an illustration.[[diagram]]The main stem of a tree may be compared to the ROOT-RACE (A).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 435 ILLUSTRATION OF THE RACES.Its larger limbs to the various SUB-RACES; seven in number (B1, B2).On each of these limbs are seven BRANCHES, OR FAMILY-RACES. (C)."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"After this the cactus-plant is a better illustration, for its fleshy \"leaves\" are covered with sharp spines, each of which maybe compared to a nation or tribe of human beings.Now our Fifth Root-Race has already been in existence -- as a race sui generis and quite free from its parent stem --about 1,000,000 years; therefore it must be inferred that each of the four preceding Sub-Races has lived approximately210,000 years; thus each Family-Race has an average existence of about 30,000 years. Thus the European \"FamilyRace\" has still a good many thousand years to run, although the nations or the innumerable spines upon it, vary witheach succeeding \"season\" of three or four thousand years. It is somewhat curious to mark the comparative approximationof duration between the lives of a \"Family-Race\" and a \"Sidereal year.\"The knowledge of the foregoing, and the accurately correct division, formed part and parcel of the Mysteries, where theseSciences were taught to the disciples, and where they were transmitted by one hierophant to another. Everyone is awarethat the European astronomers assign (arbitrarily enough) the date of the invention of the Egyptian Zodiac to the years2000 or 2400 B.C. (Proctor); and insist that this invention coincides in its date with that of the erection of the GreatPyramid. This, to an Occultist and Eastern astronomer, must appear quite absurd. The year of the Kaliyuga is said tohave begun between the 17th and 18th of February in the year 3102 B.C. Now the Hindus claim that in the year 20400before Kaliyugam, the origin of their Zodiac coincided with the spring equinox -- there being at the time a conjunction ofthe Sun and Moon -- and Bailly proved by a lengthy and careful computation of that date, that, even if fictitious, the epochfrom which they had started to establish the beginning of their Kaliyug was very real. That \"epoch is the year 3102 beforeour era,\" he writes. (See Part III., Book I. \"Hindu Astronomy defended by an Academician\".) The lunar eclipse arriving justa fortnight after the beginning of the black Age -- it took place in a point situated between the Wheat Ear of Virgo and thestar [[theta]] of the same constellation. One of their most esoteric Cycles is based upon certain conjunctions andrespective positions of Virgo and the Pleiades -- (Krittika). Hence, as the Egyptians brought their Zodiac from SouthernIndia and Lanka,* the esoteric meaning was evidently identical. The three \"Virgins,\" or Virgo in three different positions,meant, with both, the record of the first three \"divine or astronomical Dynasties,\" who taught the Third[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Ceylon.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 436 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Root-Race; and after having abandoned the Atlanteans to their doom, returned (or redescended, rather) during the thirdSub-Race of the Fifth, in order to reveal to saved humanity the mysteries of their birth-place -- the sidereal Heavens. Thesame symbolical record of the human races and the three Dynasties (Gods, Manes -- semi-divine astrals of the Third andFourth, and the \"Heroes\" of the Fifth Race), which preceded the purely human kings, was found in the distribution of thetiers and passages of the Egyptian Labyrinth. As the three inversions of the Poles of course changed the face of theZodiac, a new one had to be constructed each time. In Mackey's \"Sphinxiad\" the speculations of the bold author musthave horrified the orthodox portion of the population of Norwich, as he says, fantastically enough:--\"But, after all, the greatest length of time recorded by those monuments (the Labyrinth, the Pyramids and the Zodiacs)does not exceed five millions of years (which is not so)*; which falls short of the records given us both by the (esoteric)Chinese and Hindus; which latter nation has registered a knowledge of time for seven or eight millions of years**; which Ihave seen upon a talisman of porcelain. . . . \"The Egyptian priests had the Zodiacs of the Atlantean Asura-Maya, as the modern Hindus still have. As stated in\"Esoteric Buddhism,\" the Egyptians, as well as the Greeks and \"Romans\" some thousand years ago, were \"remnants ofthe Atlanto-Aryans,\" i.e., the former, of the older, or the Ruta Atlanteans; the last-named, the descendants of the last raceof that island, whose sudden disappearance was narrated to Solon by the Egyptian Initiates. The human Dynasty of theolder Egyptians, beginning with Menes, had all the knowledge of the Atlanteans, though there was no more Atlanteanblood in their veins. Nevertheless, they had preserved all their Archaic records. All this has been shown long ago.*** Andit is just because the Egyptian Zodiac is between 75 and 80,000 years old that the Zodiac of the Greeks is far later.Volney has correctly pointed out in his \"Ruins of Empires\" (p. 360) that it is only 16,984 years old, or up to the presentdate 17,082.****[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The forefathers of the Aryan Brahmins had their Zodiacal calculations and Zodiac from those born by Kriyasakti power,the \"Sons of Yoga\"; the Egyptians from the Atlanteans of Ruta.** The former, therefore, may have registered time for seven or eight millions of years, but the Egyptians could not.*** This question was amply challenged, and as amply discussed and answered. See Five Years of Theosophy. (Art. \"Mr.Sinnett's Esoteric Buddhism,\" pp. 325-46).**** Volney says that, as Aries was in its 15th degree 1447 B.C., it follows that the first degree of \"Libra\" could not havecoincided with the vernal equinox more lately than 15,194 years B.C., to which if you add 1790 since Christ, when Volneywrote this, it appears that 16,984 years have elapsed since the (Greek or rather Hellenic) origin of the Zodiac.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 437 MORE IN THE FORTHCOMING VOLUMES.CONCLUSION.Space forbids us to say anything more, and this part of the \"Secret Doctrine\" has to be closed. The forty-nine Stanzasand the few fragments from the Commentaries just given are all that can be published in these volumes. These, with"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"some still older records -- to which none but the highest Initiates have access -- and a whole library of comments,glossaries, and explanations, form the synopsis of Man's genesis.It is from the Commentaries that we have hitherto quoted and tried to explain the hidden meaning of some of theallegories, thus showing the true views of esoteric antiquity upon geology, anthropology, and even ethnology. We willendeavour in the Part which follows, to establish a still closer metaphysical connection between the earliest races andtheir Creators, the divine men from other worlds; accompanying the statements proffered with the most importantdemonstrations of the same in esoteric Astronomy and Symbolism.In Volume III. of this work (the said volume and the IVth being almost ready) a brief history of all the great adepts knownto the ancients and the moderns in their chronological order will be given, as also a bird's eye view of the Mysteries, theirbirth, growth, decay, and final death -- in Europe. This could not find room in the present work. Volume IV. will be almostentirely devoted to Occult teachings.The duration of the periods that separate, in space and time, the Fourth from the Fifth Race -- in the historical* or eventhe legendary beginnings of the latter -- is too tremendous for us to offer, even to a Theosophist, any more detailedaccounts of them. During the course of the post-diluvian ages -- marked at certain periodical epochs by the most terriblecataclysms -- too many races and nations were born, and have disappeared almost without leaving a trace, for any one tooffer any description of the slightest value concerning them. Whether the Masters of Wisdom have a consecutive and fullhistory of our race from its incipient stage down to the present times; whether they possess the uninterrupted record ofman since he became the complete physical being, and became thereby the king of the animals and master on this earth-- is not for the writer to say. Most probably they have,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The word \"historical\" is used, because, although historians have dwarfed almost absurdly the dates that separatecertain events from our modern day, nevertheless, once that they are known and accepted, they belong to history. Thusthe Trojan War is an historical event; and though even less than 1,000 years B.C. is the date assigned to it, yet in truth itis nearer 6,000 than 5,000 years B.C.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 438 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and such is our own personal conviction. But if so, this knowledge is only for the highest Initiates, who do not take theirstudents into their confidence. The writer can, therefore, give but what she has herself been taught, and no more.But even this will appear to the profane reader rather as a weird, fantastic dream, than as a possible reality.This is only natural and as it should be, since for years such was the impression made upon the humble writer of thesepages herself. Born and bred in European, matter-of-fact and presumably civilized countries, she assimilated theforegoing with the utmost difficulty. But there are proofs of a certain character which become irrefutable and areundeniable in the long run, to every earnest and unprejudiced mind. For a series of years such were offered to her, andnow she has the full certitude that our present globe and its human races must have been born, grown and developed inthis, and in no other way.But this is the personal view of the writer; and her orthodoxy cannot be expected to have any more weight than any other\"doxy,\" in the eyes of those to whom every fresh theory is heterodox until otherwise proved. Therefore are we Occultistsfully prepared for such questions as these: \"How does one know that the writer has not invented the whole scheme? Andsupposing she has not, how can one tell that the whole of the foregoing, as given in the Stanzas, is not the product of theimagination of the ancients? How could they have preserved the records of such an immense, such an incredibleantiquity?\"The answer that the history of this world since its formation and to its end \"is written in the stars,\" i.e., is recorded in theZodiac and the Universal Symbolism whose keys are in the keeping of the Initiates, will hardly satisfy the doubters. Theantiquity of the Zodiac in Egypt is much doubted, and it is denied point-blank with regard to India. \"Your conclusions areoften excellent, but your premises are always doubtful,\" the writer was once told by a profane friend. To this, the answercame that it was one point, at least, gained on the scientific syllogisms. For, with the exception of a few problems from thedomain of purely physical science, both the premises and conclusions of the men of Science are as hypothetical as theyare almost invariably erroneous. And if they do not so appear to the profane, the reason is simply this: the said profane isvery little aware, taking as he does his scientific data on faith, that both premises and conclusions are generally theproduct of the same brains, which, however learned, are not infallible; a truism demonstrated daily by the shifting and re-shifting of scientific theories and speculations.However it may be, the records of the temples, Zodiacal and traditional, as well as the ideographic records of the East, asread by the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 439 MODERN SCIENCE MISTRUSTED.adepts of the Sacred Science and Vidya, are not a whit more doubtful than the so-called ancient history of the Europeannations, now edited, corrected, and amplified by half a century of archaeological discoveries, and the very problematicalreadings of the Assyrian tiles, cuneiform fragments, and Egyptian hieroglyphics. So are our data based upon the samereadings, in addition to an almost inexhaustible number of Secret works of which Europe knows nothing -- plus the perfectknowledge by the Initiates of the symbolism of every word so recorded. Some of these records belong to an immenseantiquity. Every archaeologist and palaeontologist is acquainted with the ideographic productions of certain semi-savagetribes, who from time immemorial have aimed at rendering their thoughts symbolically. This is the earliest mode ofrecording events and ideas. And how old this knowledge is in the human race may be inferred from some signs, evidentlyideographic, found on hatchets of the Palaeolithic period. The red Indian tribes of America, only a few years ago"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"comparatively speaking, petitioned the President of the United States to grant them possession of four small lakes, thepetition being written on the tiny surface of a piece of a fabric, which is covered with barely a dozen representations ofanimals and birds. (See Lubbock.) The American savages have a number of such different kinds of writing, but not one ofour Scientists is yet familiar, or even knows of the early hieroglyphic cypher, still preserved in some Fraternities, andnamed in Occultism the Senzar. Moreover, all those who have decided to regard such modes of writing -- e.g., theideographs of the Red Indians, and even the Chinese characters -- as \"attempts of the early races of mankind to expresstheir untutored thoughts,\" will decidedly object to our statement, that writing was invented by the Atlanteans, and not at allby the Phoenicians. Indeed, such a claim as that writing was known to mankind many hundreds of millenniums ago, in theface of the philologists who have decreed that writing was unknown in the days of, and to Panini, in India, as also to theGreeks in the time of Homer, will be met by general disapprobation, if not with silent scorn. All denial and ridiculenotwithstanding, the Occultists will maintain the claim, and simply for this reason: from Bacon down to our modern RoyalSociety, we have a too long period, full of the most ludicrous mistakes made by Science, to warrant our believing inmodern scientific assumptions rather than in the denials of our Teachers. Writing, our scientists say, was unknown toPanini; and this sage nevertheless composed a grammar which contains 3,996 rules, and is the most perfect of all thegrammars that were ever made! Panini is made out to have lived barely a few centuries B.C., by the most liberal; and therocks in Iran and Central Asia (whence the philologists and historians------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 440 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.show us the ancestors of the same Panini, the Brahmins, coming into India) are covered with writing, two and threethousand years old (12,000, according to some fearless palaeontologists).Writing was an ars incognita in the days of Hesiod and Homer, agreeably to Grote, and unknown to the Greeks so late as770 B.C.; and the Phoenicians who had invented it, and knew writing as far back as 1500 B.C., at the earliest,* wereliving among the Greeks, and elbowing them, all the time! All these scientific and contradictory conclusions disappeared,however, into thin air, when Schliemann discovered (a) the site of ancient Troy, whose actual existence had been so longregarded as a fable; and (b), excavated on that site earthenware vessels with inscriptions in characters unknown to thepaleontologists and the all-denying Sanskritists. Who will now deny Troy, or these Archaic inscriptions? As ProfessorVirchow witnesses:-- \"I was myself an eye-witness of two such discoveries, and helped to gather the articles together.The slanderers have long since been silenced, who were not ashamed to charge the discoverer with an imposture.\"** Norwere truthful women spared any more than truthful men. Du Chaillu, Gordon-Cumming, Madame Merian,*** Bruce, and ahost of others were charged with lying.Madame Merian -- says the author of \"Mythical Monsters,\" who gives this information in the Introduction -- was accusedof deliberate falsehood in reference to her description of a bird-eating spider nearly two hundred years ago. But now-a-days reliable observers have confirmed it in regard to South America, India, and elsewhere. Audubon was accused bybotanists of having invented the yellow water-lily, which he figured in his Birds of the South under the name of Nymphaealutea, and after having lain under the imputation for years, was confirmed at last by the discovery of the long-lost flower inFlorida in 1876 (Pop. Sci. Monthly, No. 60, April 1877). And, as Audubon was called a liar for this, and for his HoliaetusWashingtonii,**** so Victor Hugo was ridiculed for . . . . his marvellous word-painting of the devil-fish, and his descriptionof a man becoming its helpless victim. \"The thing was derided as an impossibility; yet within a few years were discovered,on the shores of Newfoundland, cuttle fish with arms extending to thirty feet in length, and capable of dragging a good-sized[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is an historical fact that Sanchoniathon compiled and wrote in Phoenician characters -- from annals and Statedocuments in the archives of the older Phoenician cities -- the full record of their religion in 1250 B.C.** Prof. Virchow, in Appendix I to Schliemann's Ilios.

Mr. Charles Gould, the author of the above-citedvolume quotes in his excellent work a few lines from Macmillan (1860), which are as true as life, and too much to thepoint not to be reproduced: \"When a naturalist, either by visiting such spots of earth as are still out of the way, or by hisgood fortune, finds a very queer plant or animal, he is forthwith accused of inventing his game. . . . . . As soon as thecreature is found to sin against preconception, the great (mis ?) guiding Spirit, a priori by name, who furnishesphilosophers with their omniscience pro re nata, whispers that no such thing can be, and forthwith there is a charge ofhoax. The heavens themselves have been charged with hoaxes. When Leverrier and Adams predicted a planet bycalculation, it was gravely asserted in some quarters that the planet which had been calculated was not the planet butanother which had clandestinely and improperly got into the neighbourhood of the true body. The disposition to suspecthoax is stronger than the disposition to hoax. Who was it that first announced that the classical writings of Greece andRome were one huge hoax perpetrated by the monks in what the announcer would be as little or less inclined than Dr.Maitland to call the dark ages?\" (p. 13)."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Thus let it be.

No great truth was ever accepted a priori, and generally a century or two passed before it beganto glimmer in the human consciousness as a possible verity, except in such cases as the positive discovery of the thingclaimed as a fact. The truths of to-day are the falsehoods and errors of yesterday, and vice versa. It is only in the XXthcentury that portions, if not the whole, of the present work will be vindicated.It is no fact going against our statements, therefore, even if Sir John Evans does affirm that writing was unknown in thestone age. For it may have been unknown during that period in the Fifth Aryan race, and have been perfectly known tothe Atlanteans of the Fourth, in the palmy days of their highest civilization. The cycles of the rise and fall of the nationsand races are there to account for it.If told that there have been cases before now of forged pseudographs being palmed off on the credulous, and that ourwork may be classed with Jacolliot's \"Bible in India\" (in which, by the way, there are more truths among its errors than arefound in the works of orthodox and recognized Orientalists) -- the charge and comparison will dismay us very little. Webide our time. Even the famous \"Ezour-Veda\" of the last century, considered by Voltaire \"the most precious gift from theEast to the West,\" and by Max Muller \"about the silliest book that can be read,\" is not altogether without facts and truthsin it. The cases when the a priori negations of specialists became justified by subsequent corroborations form but aninsignificant percentage of those that were fully vindicated by subsequent discoveries, and confirmed to the great dismayof the learned objectors. \"Ezour Veda,\" was a very small bone of contention compared with the triumph of Sir WilliamJones, Anquetil de Perron, and others in the matter of Sanskrit and its literature. Such facts are recorded by ProfessorMax Muller himself, who, speaking of the discomfiture of Dugald Stewart and Co. in connection with this, states that \"if thefacts about Sanskrit were true, Dugald Stewart was too wise not to see that the conclusions drawn from them wereinevitable. He therefore denied the reality of such a language as Sanskrit altogether, and wrote his famous essay to provethat Sanskrit had been put together after the model of Greek and Latin, by those arch-forgers and liars, the Brahmans,and that the whole of Sanskrit literature was an imposition\" (Science of Language, p. 168). The writer is quite willing andfeels proud to keep company with these Brahmans, and other historical \"liars,\" in the opinion of our modern DugaldStewarts.

Yet, like St. John the Baptist,this sage of the past Ages is found preaching in the desert, in company with a more modern philosopher, namely Bacon,who offers the same priceless bit of practical Wisdom. \"In contemplation,\" he says (in any question of Knowledge, weadd), \"if a man begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end incertainties.\"With this piece of advice from the father of English Philosophy to the representatives of British scepticism we ought toclose the debate, but our theosophical readers are entitled to a final piece of Occult information.Enough was said to show that evolution in general, events, mankind, and everything else in Nature proceed in cycles. Wehave spoken of seven Races, five of which have nearly completed their earthly career, and have claimed that every Root-Race, with its sub-races and innumerable family divisions and tribes, was entirely distinct from its preceding andsucceeding race. This will be objected to, on the authority of uniform experience in the question of Anthropology, andEthnology. Man was -- save in colour and type, and perhaps a difference in facial peculiarities and cranial capacity -- everthe same under every climate and in every part of the world, say the Naturalists: ay, even in stature. This, whilemaintaining that man descends from the same unknown ancestor as the ape, a claim that is logically impossible withoutan infinite variation of stature and form, from his first evolution into a biped. The very logical persons who maintain bothpropositions are welcome to their paradoxical views. Once more we address only those who, doubting the generalderivation of myths from \"the contemplation of the visible workings of external nature\" . . . . think it, \"less hard to believethat these wonderful stories of gods and demi-gods, of giants and dwarfs, of dragons and monsters of all descriptions,are transformations, than to believe them to be inventions.\" It is only such \"transformations\" in physical nature, as muchas in the memory and conceptions of our present mankind, that the Secret Doctrine teaches. It confronts the purelyspeculative hypotheses of modern Science, based upon the experience and exact observations of barely a few centuries,with the unbroken tradition and records of its Sanctuaries; and brushing away that tissue of cobweb-like theories, spun in"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"the darkness that covers a period of hardly a few millenniums back, and which Europeans call their \"History,\" the OldScience says to us: Listen, now, to my version of the memoirs of Humanity.The human Races are born one from the other, grow, develop, become------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 444 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.old, and die. Their sub-races and nations follow the same rule. If your all-denying modern science and so-calledphilosophy do not contest that the human family is composed of a variety of well-defined types and races, it is onlybecause the fact is undeniable, no one would say that there was no external difference between an Englishman, anAfrican negro, and a Japanese or Chinaman. On the other hand it is formally denied by most naturalists that mixedhuman races, i.e., the seeds for entirely new races, are any longer formed in our days. But this last is maintained on goodgrounds by de Quatrefages and some others.Nevertheless our general proposition will not be accepted. It will be said that whatever forms man has passed through inthe long pre-historic Past there are no more changes for him (save certain variations, as at present) in the future. Hencethat our Sixth and Seventh Root Races are fictions.To this it is again answered: How do you know? Your experience is limited to a few thousand years, to less than a day inthe whole age of Humanity and to the present types of the actual continents and isles of our Fifth Race. How can you tellwhat will or will not be? Meanwhile, such is the prophecy of the Secret Books and their no uncertain statements.Since the beginning of the Atlantean Race many million years have passed, yet we find the last of the Atlanteans, stillmixed up with the Aryan element, 11,000 years ago. This shows the enormous overlapping of one race over the racewhich succeeds it, though in character and external type the elder loses its characteristics, and assumes the newfeatures of the younger race. This is proved in all the formations of mixed human races. Now, Occult philosophy teachesthat even now, under our very eyes, the new Race and Races are preparing to be formed, and that it is in America thatthe transformation will take place, and has already silently commenced.Pure Anglo-Saxons hardly three hundred years ago, the Americans of the United States have already become a nationapart, and, owing to a strong admixture of various nationalities and inter-marriage, almost a race sui generis, not onlymentally, but also physically. \"Every mixed race, when uniform and settled, has been able to play the part of a primaryrace in fresh crossings,\" says de Quatrefages. \"Mankind, in its present state, has thus been formed, certainly, for thegreatest part, by the successive crossing of a number of races at present undetermined\" (\"The Human Species,\" p. 274.)Thus the Americans have become in only three centuries a \"primary race,\" pro tem., before becoming a race apart, andstrongly separated from all other now existing races. They are, in short, the germs of the Sixth sub-race, and in some fewhundred years more, will become------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 445 THE COMING NEW RACE.most decidedly the pioneers of that race which must succeed to the present European or fifth sub-race, in all its newcharacteristics. After this, in about 25,000 years, they will launch into preparations for the seventh sub-race; until, inconsequence of cataclysms -- the first series of those which must one day destroy Europe, and still later the whole Aryanrace (and thus affect both Americas), as also most of the lands directly connected with the confines of our continent andisles -- the Sixth Root-Race will have appeared on the stage of our Round. When shall this be? Who knows save thegreat Masters of Wisdom, perchance, and they are as silent upon the subject as the snow-capped peaks that towerabove them. All we know is, that it will silently come into existence; so silently, indeed, that for long millenniums shall itspioneers -- the peculiar children who will grow into peculiar men and women -- be regarded as anomalous lusus naturae,abnormal oddities physically and mentally. Then, as they increase, and their numbers become with every age greater,one day they will awake to find themselves in a majority. It is the present men who will then begin to be regarded asexceptional mongrels, until these die out in their turn in civilised lands; surviving only in small groups on islands -- themountain peaks of to-day -- where they will vegetate, degenerate, and finally die out, perhaps millions of years hence, asthe Aztecs have, as the Nyam-Nyam and the dwarfish Moola Koorumba of the Nilghiri Hills are dying. All these are theremnants of once mighty races, the recollection of whose existence has entirely died out of the remembrance of themodern generations, just as we shall vanish from the memory of the Sixth Race Humanity. The Fifth will overlap the SixthRace for many hundreds of millenniums, changing with it slower than its new successor, still changing in stature, generalphysique, and mentality, just as the Fourth overlapped our Aryan race, and the Third had overlapped the Atlanteans.This process of preparation for the Sixth great Race must last throughout the whole sixth and seventh sub-races (videsupra, the diagram of the Genealogical Tree of the Fifth Race). But the last remnants of the Fifth Continent will notdisappear until some time after the birth of the new Race; when another and new dwelling, the sixth continent, will haveappeared above the new waters on the face of the globe, so as to receive the new stranger. To it also will emigrate andsettle all those who shall be fortunate enough to escape the general disaster. When this shall be -- as just said -- it is notfor the writer to know. Only, as nature no more proceeds by sudden jumps and starts, than man changes suddenly from achild into a mature man, the final cataclysm will be preceded by many smaller submersions and destructions both bywave and volcanic fires. The exultant pulse will beat------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 446 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.high in the heart of the race now in the American zone, but there will be no more Americans when the Sixth Racecommences; no more, in fact, than Europeans; for they will have now become a new race, and many new nations. Yetthe Fifth will not die, but survive for a while: overlapping the new Race for many hundred thousands of years to come, itwill become transformed with it -- slower than its new successor -- still getting entirely altered in mentality, generalphysique, and stature. Mankind will not grow again into giant bodies as in the case of the Lemurians and the Atlanteans;"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"because while the evolution of the Fourth race led the latter down to the very bottom of materiality in its physicaldevelopment, the present Race is on its ascending arc; and the Sixth will be rapidly growing out of its bonds of matter,and even of flesh.Thus it is the mankind of the New world -- one by far the senior of our Old one, a fact men had also forgotten -- of Patala(the Antipodes, or the Nether World, as America is called in India), whose mission and Karma it is, to sow the seeds for aforthcoming, grander, and far more glorious Race than any of those we know of at present. The Cycles of Matter will besucceeded by Cycles of Spirituality and a fully developed mind. On the law of parallel history and races, the majority ofthe future mankind will be composed of glorious Adepts. Humanity is the child of cyclic Destiny, and not one of its Unitscan escape its unconscious mission, or get rid of the burden of its co-operative work with nature. Thus will mankind, raceafter race, perform its appointed cycle-pilgrimage. Climates will, and have already begun, to change, each tropical yearafter the other dropping one sub-race, but only to beget another higher race on the ascending cycle; while a series ofother less favoured groups -- the failures of nature -- will, like some individual men, vanish from the human family withouteven leaving a trace behind.Such is the course of Nature under the sway of KARMIC LAW: of the ever present and the ever-becoming Nature. For, inthe words of a Sage, known only to a few Occultists:-- \"THE PRESENT IS THE CHILD OF THE PAST; THE FUTURE,THE BEGOTTEN OF THE PRESENT. AND YET, O PRESENT MOMENT!

The theories contained in the Second Partof the Stanzas are even more difficult to assimilate than those which are embodied in Vol. 1, on Cosmogony. Theology,therefore, has to be questioned here, as Science will be in the Addenda (Part III.). Since our doctrines differ so widelyfrom the current ideas of both Materialism and Theology, the Occultists must be ever prepared to repel the attacks ofeither or of both.The reader can never be too often reminded that, as the abundant quotations from various old Scriptures prove, theseteachings are as old as the world; and that the present work is a simple attempt to render, in modern language and in aphraseology with which the scientific and educated student is familiar, archaic Genesis and History as taught in certainAsiatic centres of esoteric learning. They must be accepted or rejected on their own merits, fully or partially; but notbefore they have been carefully compared with the corresponding theological dogmas and the modern scientific theoriesand speculations.One feels a serious doubt whether, with all its intellectual acuteness, our age is destined to discover in each westernnation even one solitary uninitiated scholar or philosopher capable of fully comprehending the spirit of archaic philosophy.Nor can one be expected to do so, before the real meaning of these terms, the Alpha and the Omega of Easternesotericism, the words Sat and Asat, -- so freely used in the Rig-Veda, and elsewhere -- is thoroughly assimilated.Without this key to the Aryan Wisdom, the Cosmogony of the Rishis and the Arhats is in danger of remaining a dead letterto the average Orientalist. Asat is not merely the negation of Sat, nor is it the \"not yet existing\"; for Sat is in itself neitherthe \"existent,\" nor \"being.\" SAT is the immutable, the ever present, changeless and eternal root, from and through whichall proceeds. But it is far more than the potential force in the seed, which propels onward the process of development, orwhat is now called evolution. It is the ever becoming, though the never manifesting.* Sat[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Hegelian doctrine, which identifies Absolute Being or \"Be-ness\" with \"non-Being,\" and represents the Universe asan eternal becoming, is identical with the Vedanta philosophy.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 450 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"is born from Asat, and ASAT is begotten by Sat: the perpetual motion in a circle, truly; yet a circle that can be squaredonly at the supreme Initiation, at the threshold of Paranirvana.Barth started a reflection on the Rig-Veda which was meant for a stern criticism, an unusual, therefore, as was thought,an original view of this archaic volume. It so happened, however, that, while criticising, that scholar revealed a truth,without being himself aware of its full importance. He premises by saying that \"neither in the language nor in the thoughtof the Rig-Veda\" has he \"been able to discover that quality of primitive natural simplicity, which so many are fain to see init.\" Barth had Max Muller in his mind's eye when writing this. For the famous Oxford professor has throughoutcharacterised the hymns of the Rig Veda, as the unsophisticated expression of the religious feeling of a pastoral innocentpeople. \"In the Vedic hymns the ideas and myths appear in their simplest and freshest form;\" -- the Sanskrit scholarthinks. Barth is of a different opinion, however.So divided and personal are the opinions of Sanskritists as to the importance and intrinsic value of the Rig Veda, thatthose opinions become entirely biassed whichever way they incline. Thus Mr. Max Muller declares that: \"Nowhere is thewide distance which separates the ancient poems of India from the most ancient literature of Greece more clearly felt,than when we compare the growing myths of the Veda with the full grown and decayed myths on which the poetry ofHomer is founded. The Veda is the real Theogony of the Aryan races, while that of Hesiod is a distorted caricature of theoriginal image.\" This is a sweeping assertion, and perhaps rather unjust in its general application. But why not try toaccount for it? Orientalists cannot do so, for they reject the chronology of the Secret Doctrine, and could hardly admit thefact that between the Rig-Vedic hymns and Hesiod's Theogony tens of thousands of years have elapsed. So they fail tosee that the Greek myths are no longer the primitive symbolical language of the Initiates, the disciples of the gods-Hierophants, the divine ancient \"sacrificers,\" and that disfigured by the distance, and encumbered by the exuberantgrowth of human profane fancy, they now stand like distorted images of stars in running waves. But if Hesiod'sCosmogony and Theogony are to be viewed as caricatures of the original images, how much more so the myths in theHebrew Genesis in the sight of those, for whom they are no more divine revelation or the word of God, than Hesiod'sTheogony is for Mr. Gladstone.\"The poetry it (the Rig Veda) contains appears to me, on the contrary,\" says Barth \"to be of a singularly refined characterand------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 451 THE VEDAS WRITTEN BY INITIATES.artificially elaborated, full of allusions and reticences, of pretensions (?) to mysticism and theosophic insight, and themanner of its expression is such as reminds one more frequently of the phraseology in use among certain small groups ofinitiated, than the poetic language of a large community.\" (\"The Religions of India,\" p. xiii.)We will not stop to enquire of the critic what he can know of the phraseology in use among the \"initiated,\" or whether hebelongs himself to such a group; for, in the latter case, he would hardly have used such language. But the above showsthe remarkable disagreement between scholars even with regard to the external character of the Rig Veda. What, then,can any of the modern Sanskritists know about its internal or esoteric meaning, beyond the correct inference of Barth,that this Scripture has been compiled by INITIATES?The whole of the present work is an endeavour to prove this truth. The ancient adepts have solved the great problems ofscience, however unwilling modern materialism may be to admit the fact. The mysteries of Life and Death were fathomedby the great master-minds of antiquity; and if they have preserved them in secresy and silence, it is because theseproblems formed part of the sacred mysteries; and, secondly, because they must have remained incomprehensible to thevast majority of men then, as they do now. If such teachings are still regarded as chimeras by our opponents inphilosophy, it may be a consolation to the Theosophists to learn, on good proofs, that the speculations of modernpsychologists -- whether serious Idealists, like Mr. Herbert Spencer, or wool-gathering pseudo-Idealists -- are far morechimerical. Indeed, instead of resting on the firm foundation of facts in Nature, they are the unhealthy will-o'-the-wisps ofmaterialistic imagination, of the brains that evolved them -- and no more. While they deny, we affirm; and our affirmationis corroborated by almost all the sages of antiquity. Believing in Occultism and a host of invisible Potencies for goodreasons, we say: Certus sum, scio quod credidi; to which our critics reply: Credat Judaeus Apella. Neither is converted bythe other, nor does such result affect even our little planet. E pur se muove!Nor is there any need of proselytizing. As remarked by the wise Cicero, \"Time destroys the speculations of man, but itconfirms the judgment of nature.\" Let us bide our time. Meanwhile, it is not in the human constitution to witness in silencethe destruction of one's gods, whether they be true or false. And as theology and materialism have combined together todestroy the old gods of antiquity and seek to disfigure every old philosophical conception, it is but just that the lovers ofold wisdom should defend their position, by proving that the whole arsenal of the two is, at best, formed of new weaponsmade out of very old material.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 452 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.§ XVI.ADAM-ADAMI.NAMES such as Adam-Adami, used by Mr. Chwolsohn in his \"Nabathean Agriculture\"* and derided by M.

To the Occultist, however, once that the term is found in a work of such immense antiquity asthe above cited, it proves a good deal: for instance that Adami was a manifold symbol, originating with the Aryan people,as the root word shows, and having been taken from them by the Semites and the Turanians -- as many other thingswere.\"Adam-Adami\" is a generic compound name as old as languages are. The Secret Doctrine teaches that Ad-i was thename given to the first speaking race of mankind -- in this Round -- by the Aryans. Hence the Adonim and Adonai (the"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"ancient plural form of the word Adon), which the Jews applied to their Jehovah and angels, who were simply the firstspiritual and ethereal sons of the earth; and the god Adonis, who in his many variations stood for the \"First Lord.\" Adam isthe Sanskrit Ada-Nath, also meaning first Lord, as Ad-Iswara, or any Ad (the first) followed by any adjective orsubstantive. The reason for this is that such truths were a common inheritance. It was a revelation received by the firstmankind before that time which, in Biblical phraseology, is called \"the period of one lip and word,\" or speech; knowledgeexpanded by man's own intuition later on, but still later hidden from profanation under an adequate symbology. Theauthor of the \"Qabbalah, (according to), the philosophical writings of Ibn Gebirol,\" shows the Israelite using \"Adonai,\"(Lord) instead of Eh'yeh (I am) and YHVH, and adds that, while Adonai is rendered \"Lord\" in the Bible, \"the lowestdesignation, or the Deity in Nature, the more general term Elohim, is translated God.\" (p. 175.)A curious work was translated in 1860 or thereabout, by the Orientalist Chwolsohn, and presented to ever-incredulousand flippant Europe under the innocent title of Nabathean Agriculture. In the opinion of the translator that archaic volumeis \"a complete initiation into the mysteries of the pre-Adamite nations, on the authority of undeniably authenticdocuments.\" It is \"an invaluable compendium, the full epitome of the Doctrines held, of the arts and sciences, not only ofthe Chaldeans, but also of the Assyrians and Canaanites of the prehistoric ages.\" These[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide infra.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 453 \"NABATHEAN AGRICULTURE.\"\"Nabatheans\" -- as some critics thought -- were simply the Sabeans, or Chaldean star-worshippers. The work is aretranslation from the Arabic, into which language it was at first translated from the Chaldean.Masoudi, the Arabic Historian, speaks of those Nabatheans, and explains their origin in this wise: \"After the Deluge (?)the nations established themselves in various countries. Among these were the Nabatheans, who founded the city ofBabylon, and were those descendants of Ham who settled in the same province under the leadership of Nimrod, the sonof Cush, who was the son of Ham, and great-grandson of Noah. . . . . This took place at the time when Nimrod receivedthe governorship of Babylonia as the delegate of Dzahhak named Biurasp.\"The translator, Chwolsohn, finds that the assertions of this historian are in perfect accord with those of Moses in Genesis;while more irreverent critics might express the opinion that for this very reason their truth should be suspected. It isuseless to argue this point, which is of no value in the present question. The weather-beaten, long-since-buried problem,and the difficulty of accounting, on any logical ground, for the phenomenal derivation of millions of people of variousraces, of many civilized nations and tribes, from three couples (Noah's sons) in 346 years* after the Deluge, may be leftto the Karma of the author of Genesis, whether he is called Moses or Ezra. That which is interesting in the work noticed isits, the doctrines enunciated in it, which are again, if read esoterically, almost all of them identical with the SecretTeachings.Quatremere suggested that this book might have been simply a copy made under Nebuchadnezzar II., from someHamitic treatise, \"infinitely more ancient,\" while the author maintains, on \"internal and external evidence,\" that itsChaldean original was written out from the oral discourses and teachings of a wealthy Babylonian landowner, named Qu-tamy, who had used for those lectures still more ancient materials. The first Arabic translation is placed by Chwolsohn sofar back as the XIII. cent. B.C. On the first page of this \"revelation,\" the author, or amanuensis, Qu-tamy, declares that\"the doctrines propounded therein, were originally told by Saturn to the Moon, who communicated them to her idol, whichidol revealed them to her devotee, the writer -- the adept Scribe of that work -- Qu-tamy.The details given by the God for the benefit and instruction of mortals, show periods of incalculable duration and a seriesof numberless kingdoms and Dynasties that preceded the appearance on Earth of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Genesis and the authorised Chronology. In Chapt. ix. \"Noah leaveth the Ark\" \"B.C. 2348.\" Chapter x. \"Nimrod thefirst Monarch,\" stands over \"B.C. 1998.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 454 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Adami (the \"red-earth\"). These periods have aroused, as might have been expected, the defenders of the chronology ofthe Biblical dead-letter meaning almost to fury. De Rougemont was the first to make a levee-in-arms against thetranslator. He reproaches him* with \"sacrificing Moses to an anonymous author.\" Berosus, he urges, \"however great werehis chronological errors, was at least in perfect accord with the prophet with regard to the first men, since he speaks ofAlorus-Adam, of Xisuthrus-Noah, and of Belus-Nimrod,\" etc. \"Therefore,\" he adds, \"the work must be an APOCRYPHA tobe ranged with its contemporaries -- the fourth book of Esdras, that of Enoch, the Sibylline Oracles, and the Book ofHermes -- every one of these dating no further back than two or three centuries B.C.\" Ewald came down still harder onChwolsohn, and finally M. Renan. In the \"Revue Germanique,\"** the ex-pupil pulls down the authority of his master, byasking him to show a reason why his Nabathean Agriculture should not be the fraudulent work of some Jew of the third orfourth century of our era? It can hardly be otherwise -- argues the romancer of the \"Life of Jesus.\" Since, in this in-folio onastrology and Sorcery we recognise in the personages introduced by Qu-tamy, all the patriarchs of the Biblical legends,such as Adam-Adami, Anouka-Noah, and his Ibrahim-Abraham etc., etc.\"This is no reason, since Adam and others are generic names. Meanwhile it is humbly submitted that, all thingsconsidered, an apocrypha -- if even of the third century A.D., instead of the thirteenth century B.C., as suggested byQuatremere -- is old enough to appear genuine as a document, and so satisfy the demands of the most exactingarchaeologist and critic. For, even admitting, for argument's sake, that this literary relic has been compiled by \"some Jewof the third century of our era\" -- what of that? Leaving the credibility of its doctrines for a moment aside, why should it be"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"less entitled to a hearing, or less instructive as reflecting older opinions, than any other religious work, also a \"compilationfrom old texts\" or oral tradition -- of the same or even a later age?

Renan, an iconoclast by principle -- so pointedly called by Jules Lemaitre \"le Paganini du Neant\"-- the worst fault found with the work is, it would seem, that the \"apocrypha\" pretends to have been communicated as arevelation to an adept by, and from, the \"idol of the moon,\" who received it from \"Saturn.\" Hence, very naturally, it is \"afairy tale all round.\" To this there is but one answer: it is no more a fairy tale than the Bible, and if one falls, the other mustfollow it. Even the mode of divination through \"the idol of the moon\" is the same as practised by David, Saul, and the HighPriests of the Jewish Tabernacle by means of the Teraphim. In Volume III., Part II. of this present work, the practicalmethods of such ancient divination will be found.The \"Nabathean Agriculture\" is a compilation indeed; it is no apocrypha, but the repetition of the tenets of the SecretDoctrine under the exoteric Chaldean form of national symbols, for the purpose of \"cloaking\" the tenets, just as the Booksof Hermes and the Puranas are Egyptian and Hindu attempts at the same. The work was as well known in antiquity as itwas during the Middle Ages. Maimonides speaks of it, and refers more than once to this Chaldeo-Arabic MS., calling theNabatheans by their co-religionary name, i.e., \"star-worshippers,\" or Sabeans, but yet failing to see in this disfigured word\"Nabatheans\" the mystic name of the caste devoted to Nebo (god of secret wisdom), which shows on its face that theNabatheans were an occult Brotherhood.* The Nabatheans who, according to the Persian Yezidi, originally came to Syriafrom Busrah, were the degenerate members of that fraternity; still their religion, even at that late day, was purelyKabalistic.** Nebo is the deity of the planet Mercury, and Mercury is the god of Wisdom or Hermes, and Budha, which theJews called [[hebrew]] \"the Lord on high, the aspiring,\" . . . and the Greeks Nabo, [[Nabo]], hence Nabatheans.Notwithstanding that Maimonides calls their doctrines \"heathenish foolishness\" and their archaic literature \"Sabaeorumfoetum,\" he places their \"agriculture,\" the Bible of Qu-tamy, in the first rank of Archaic literature; and Abarbinel[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"I will mention to thee the writings . . . respecting the belief of the Sabeans,\" he says. \"The most famous is the Book 'TheAgriculture of the Nabatheans,' which has been translated by Ibn Wahohijah. This book is full of heathenish foolishness. .. . It speaks of preparations of TALISMANS, the drawing down of the powers of the SPIRITS, MAGIC, DEMONS, andghouls, which make their abode in the desert.\" (Maimonides, quoted by Dr. D. Chwolsohn, \"Die Ssabier und derSsabismus,\" II., p. 458.) The Nabatheans of Mount Lebanon believed in the Seven Archangels, as their forefathers hadbelieved in the Seven Great Stars, the abodes and bodies of these Archangels, believed in to this day by the RomanCatholics, as is shown elsewhere.** See \"Isis Unveiled,\" Vol. II., p. 197.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 456 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.praises it in unmeasured terms. Spencer, quoting the latter, speaks of it as that \"most excellent Oriental work,\" adding(vol. 1., p. 354) that by Nabatheans, the Sabeans, the Chaldeans, and the Egyptians, in short all those nations againstwhom the laws of Moses were most severely enacted, have to be understood.Nebo, the oldest God of Wisdom of Babylonia and Mesopotamia, was identical with the Hindu Budha and Hermes-Mercury of the Greeks. A slight change in the sexes of the parents is the only alteration. As Budha was the Son of Soma(the Moon) in India, and of the wife of Brihaspati (Jupiter), so Nebo was the son of Zarpa-nitu (the Moon deity) and ofMerodach, who had become Jupiter, after having been a Sun God. As Mercury the planet, Nebo was the \"overseer\"among the seven gods of the planets; and as the personification of the Secret Wisdom he was Nabin, a seer and aprophet. The fact that Moses is made to die and disappear on the mount sacred to Nebo, shows him an initiate and apriest of that god under another name; for this God of Wisdom was the great creative deity, and was worshipped as such,not alone at Borsippa in his gorgeous Temple, or planet-tower. He was likewise adored by the Moabites, the Canaanites,the Assyrians, and throughout the whole of Palestine: then why not by the Israelites? \"The planetary temple of Babylon\"had \"its holy of holies\" within the shrine of Nebo, the prophet god of Wisdom. We are told in the Hibbert Lectures, \"Theancient Babylonians had an intercessor between men and the gods . . . and Nebo, was the 'proclaimer' or 'prophet,' as hemade known the desire of his father Merodach.\"Nebo is a creator, like Budha, of the Fourth and also of the Fifth Race. For the former starts a new race of Adepts, andthe latter, the Solar-Lunar Dynasty, or the men of these Races and Round. Both are the Adams of their respectivecreatures. Adam-Adami is a personation of the dual Adam: of the paradigmic Adam-Kadmon, the creator, and of thelower Adam, the terrestrial, who, as the Syrian Kabalists have it, had only nephesh, \"the breath of life,\" but no living soul,until after his Fall."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"If, therefore, Renan persists in regarding the Chaldean Scriptures -- or what remains of them -- as apocryphal, it is quiteimmaterial to truth and fact. There are other Orientalists who may be of a different opinion; and even were they not, itwould still really matter very little. These doctrines contain the teachings of Esoteric philosophy, and this must suffice. Tothose who understand nothing of symbology it may appear astrolatry, pure and simple, or to him who would conceal theesoteric truth, even \"heathenish foolishness.\" Maimonides, however, while expressing scorn for the esotericism in thereligion of other nations, confessed esotericism and symbology in his own, preached------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 457 THE KABALISTIC FOUR ADAMS.silence and secresy upon the true meaning of Mosaic sayings, and thus came to grief. The Doctrines of Qu-tamy, theChaldean, are, in short, the allegorical rendering of the religion of the earliest nations of the Fifth Race.Why then should M. Renan treat the name \"Adam-Adami\" with such academical contempt? The author of the \"Origins ofChristianity\" evidently knows nothing of the \"origins of pagan symbolism\" or of Esotericism either, otherwise he wouldhave known that the name was a form of universal symbol, referring, even with the Jews, not to one man, but to fourdistinct humanities or mankinds. This is very easily proven.The Kabalists teach the existence of four distinct Adams, or the transformation of four consecutive Adams, theemanations from the Dyooknah (divine phantom) of the Heavenly Man, an ethereal combination of Neschamah, thehighest Soul or Spirit: this Adam having, of course, neither a gross human body, nor a body of desire. This \"Adam\" is theprototype (tzure) of the second Adam. That they represent our Five Races is certain, as everyone can see by theirdescription in the Kabala: the first being the \"perfect, Holy Adam\"; . . . \"a shadow that disappeared\" (the Kings of Edom)produced from the divine Tzelem (Image); the second is called the protoplastic androgyne Adam of the future terrestrialand separated Adam; the third Adam is the man made of \"dust\" (the first, innocent Adam); and the fourth, is the supposedforefather of our own race -- the Fallen Adam. See, however, the admirably clear description of these in Mr. Isaac Myer's\"Qabbalah,\" p. 418, et seq. He gives only four Adams, because of the Kings of Edom, no doubt. \"The fourth Adam,\" hewrites, \" . . . . was clothed with skin, flesh, nerves, etc. This answers to the Lower Nephesch and Guff, i.e., body, united.He has the animal power of reproduction and continuance of species,\" and this is the human Root-Race.It is just at this point that the modern Kabalists -- led into error by the long generations of Christian mystics who havetampered with the Kabalistic records wherever they could -- diverge from the Occultists in their interpretations, and takethe later thought for the earlier idea. The original Kabala was entirely metaphysical, and had no concern with animal, orterrestrial sexes; the later Kabala has suffocated the divine ideal under the heavy phallic element. The Kabalists say:--\"God made man male and female.\" \"Among the Qabbalists, the necessity to continued creation and existence is calledthe Balance,\" says the author of Qabbalah; and being without this \"Balance,\" connected with Ma-qom (mysteriousplace),* even the First Race is not,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Simply, the womb, the \"Holy of Holies\" with the Semites.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 458 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.as we have seen, recognized by the Sons of the Fifth Adam. From the highest Heavenly Man, the upper Adam who is\"male female\" or Androgyne, down to the Adam of dust, these personified symbols are all connected with sex andprocreation. With the Eastern Occultists it is entirely the reverse. The sexual relation they consider as a \"Karma\"pertaining only to the mundane relation of man, who is dominated by Illusion, a thing to be put aside, the moment that theperson becomes \"wise.\" They considered it a most fortunate circumstance if the Guru (teacher) found in his pupil anaptitude for the pure life of Brahmacharya. Their dual symbols were to them but the poetical imagery of the sublimecorrelation of creative Cosmic forces. And this ideal conception is found beaming like a golden ray upon each idol,however coarse and grotesque, in the crowded galleries of the sombre fanes of India and other Mother lands of cults.This will be demonstrated in the following Section.Meanwhile, it may be added that, with the Gnostics, the second Adam also emanates from the Primeval Man, the OphiteAdamas, in \"whose image he is made\"; the third, from this second -- an Androgyne. The latter is symbolized in the 6thand 7th pairs of the male-female AEons, --Amphian-Essumene, and Vannanin-Lamer (Father and Mother; videValentinian Table, in Epiphanius) -- while the fourth Adam, or Race, is represented by a Priapean monster. The latter -- apost-Christian fancy -- is the degraded copy of the ante-Christian Gnostic symbol of the \"Good One,\" or \"He, who createdbefore anything existed,\" the Celestial Priapus -- truly born from Venus and Bacchus when that God returned from hisexpedition into India, for Venus and Bacchus are the post-types of Aditi and the Spirit. The later Priapus, one, however,with Agathodaemon, the Gnostic Saviour, and even with Abraxas, is no longer the glyph for abstract creative Power, butsymbolizes the four Adams, or Races, the fifth being represented by the five branches cut off from the Tree of Life onwhich the old man stands in the Gnostic gems. The number of the Root-Races was recorded in the ancient Greektemples by the seven vowels, of which five were framed in a panel in the Initiation halls of the Adyta. The Egyptian glyphfor it was a hand with five fingers spread, the fifth or little finger being only half-grown, and also five \"N's\" -- hieroglyphsstanding for that letter. The Romans used the five vowels A E I O V in their fanes; and this archaic symbol was adoptedduring the middle ages as a motto by the House of the Hapsburgs.

The Gentiles, by placing in the Adytum a sarcophagus, or a tomb (taphos), and the solar-god to whom thetemple was consecrated, held it, as Pantheists, in the greatest veneration. They regarded it -- in its esoteric meaning -- asthe symbol of resurrection, cosmic, solar (or diurnal), and human. It embraced the wide range of periodical and (in time)punctual, Manvantaras, or the re-awakenings of Kosmos, Earth, and Man to new existences; the sun being the mostpoetical and also the most grandiose symbol of the same in heaven, and man -- in his re-incarnations -- on Earth. TheJews -- whose realism, if judged by the dead letter, was as practical and gross in the days of Moses as it is now* -- in thecourse of their estrangement from the gods of their pagan neighbours, consummated a national and levitical polity, by thedevice of setting forth their Holy of Holies as the most solemn sign of their Monotheism -- exoterically; while seeing in itbut a universal phallic symbol -- esoterically. While the Kabalists knew but Ain-Soph and the \"gods\" of the Mysteries, theLevites had no tomb, no god in their adytum but the \"Sacred\" Ark of the Covenant -- their \"Holy of Holies.\"When the esoteric meaning of this recess is made clear, however, the profane will be better able to understand whyDavid danced \"uncovered\" before the ark of the Covenant, and was so anxious to appear vile for the sake of his \"Lord,\"and base in his own sight. (See 2 Samuel vi. 16-22.)The ark is the navi-form Argha of the Mysteries. Parkhurst, who has[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* But it was not so, in reality, witness their prophets. It is the later Rabbis and the Talmudic scheme that killed out allspirituality from the body of their symbols; leaving only their Scriptures -- a dead shell, from which the Soul has departed.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 460 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.a long dissertation upon it in his Greek dictionary, and who never breathes a word about it in the Hebrew lexicon, explainsit thus:-- \"[[Arche]] in this application answers to the Hebrew rasit or wisdom . . . . a word which had the meaning of theemblem of the female generative power, the Arg or Arca, in which the germ of all nature was supposed to float or broodon the great abyss during the interval which took place after every mundane cycle.\" Quite so; and the Jewish ark of theCovenant had precisely the same significance; with the supplementary addition that, instead of a beautiful and chastesarcophagus (the symbol of the matrix of Nature and resurrection) as in the Sanctum sanctorum of the pagans, they hadthe ark made still more realistic in its construction by the two cherubs set up on the coffer or ark of the covenant, facingeach other, with their wings spread in such a manner as to form a perfect yoni (as now seen in India). Besides which, thisgenerative symbol had its significance enforced by the four mystic letters of Jehovah's name, namely, [[hebrew]]; or[[hebrew]] meaning Jod (membrum Virile, see Kabala); [[hebrew]] (the womb); [[hebrew]] (Vau, a crook or a hook, a nail),and [[hebrew]] again, meaning also \"an opening\"; the whole forming the perfect bisexual emblem or symbol or Y (e) H (o)V (a) H, the male and female symbol.Perhaps also, when people realise the true meaning of the office and title of the Kadesh Kadeshim, \"the holy ones,\" or\"the consecrated to the temple of the Lord,\" -- the \"Holy of Holies\" of the latter may assume an aspect far from edifying.Iacchus again is Iao or Jehovah; and Baal or Adon, like Bacchus, was a phallic god. \"Who shall ascend into the hill (thehigh place) of the Lord?\" asks the holy king David, \"who shall stand in the place of his Kadushu [[hebrew]]?\" (Psalms xxiv.3). Kadesh may mean in one sense to devote, hallow, sanctify, and even to initiate or to set apart; but it also means theministry of lascivious rites (the Venus-worship) and the true interpretation of the word Kadesh is bluntly rendered inDeuteronomy xxiii. 17; Hosea iv. 14; and Genesis xxxvii. from verses 15 to 22. The \"holy\" Kadeshuth of the Bible wereidentical, as to the duties of their office, with the Nautch-girls of the later Hindu pagodas. The Hebrew Kadeshim, or galli,lived \"by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove,\" or the bust of Venus-Astarte, says versethe seventh in the twenty-third chapter of 2 Kings.The dance performed by David round the ark was the \"circle-dance.\" said to have been prescribed by the Amazons forthe Mysteries. Such was the dance of the daughters of Shiloh (Judges xxi. 21, 23 et passim), and the leaping of theprophets of Baal (I Kings xviii. 26). It was simply a characteristic of the Sabean worship, for it denoted the motion of theplanets round the sun. That the dance was a Bacchic frenzy is------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 461 WHAT WAS THE CIRCLE-DANCE.apparent. Sistra were used on the occasion, and the taunt of Michal and the King's reply are very expressive.

The umbilicus is connectedthrough the placenta with the receptacle in which are fructified the embryos of the race. . .

The oldest system and the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The author of the \"Qabbalah\" makes several attempts to prove conclusively the antiquity of the Zohar. Thus he showsthat Moses de Leon could not be the author or the forger of the Zoharic works in the XIIIth century, as he is accused ofbeing, since Ibn Gebirol gave out the same philosophical teaching 225 years before the day of Moses de Leon. No trueKabalist or scholar will ever deny the fact. It is certain that Ibn Gebirol based his doctrines upon the oldest Kabalisticsources, namely, the \"Chaldean Book of Numbers,\" as well as some no longer extant Midrashim, the same, no doubt, asthose used by Moses de Leon. But it is just the difference between the two ways of treating the same esoteric subjects,which, while proving the enormous antiquity of the esoteric system, points to a decided ring of Talmudistic and evenChristian sectarianism in the compilation and glossaries of the Zoharic system by Rabbi Moses. Ibn Gebirol never quotedfrom the Scriptures to enforce the teachings (vide I. Myer's Qabbalah, p. 7). Moses de Leon has made of the Zohar thatwhich it has remained to this day, \"a running commentary on the . . . Books of the Pentateuch\" (ibid.), with a few lateradditions made by Christian hands. One follows the archaic esoteric philosophy; the other, only that portion which wasadapted to the lost Books of Moses restored by Ezra. Thus, while the system, or the trunk on which the primitive originalZohar was engrafted, is of an immense antiquity many of the (later) Zoharic offshoots are strongly coloured by thepeculiar views held by Christian Gnostics (Syrian and Chaldean), the friends and co-workers of Moses de Leon who, asshown by Munk, accepted their interpretations.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 462 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Chaldean Kabala were identical. The latest renderings of the Zohar are those of the Synagogue in the early centuries --i.e., the Thorah, dogmatic and uncompromising.The \"King's Chamber\" in Cheops' Pyramid is thus an Egyptian \"Holy of Holies.\" On the days of the Mysteries of Initiation,the candidate, representing the solar god, had to descend into the Sarcophagus, and represent the energizing ray,entering into the fecund womb of Nature. Emerging from it on the following morning, he typified the resurrection of lifeafter the change called Death. In the great MYSTERIES his figurative death lasted two days, when with the Sun he aroseon third morning, after a last night of the most cruel trials. While the postulant represented the Sun -- the all-vivifying Orbthat \"resurrects\" every morning but to impart life to all -- the Sarcophagus was symbolic of the female principle. This, inEgypt; its form and shape changed with every country, provided it remained a vessel, a symbolic navis or boat-shapedvehicle, and a container, symbolically, of germs or the germ of life. In India, it is the \"golden\" Cow through which thecandidate for Brahminism has to pass if he desires to be a Brahmin, and to become DWIJA (\"reborn a second time\"). Thecrescent-form Argha of the Greeks was the type of the Queen of Heaven -- Diana, or the Moon. She was the greatMother of all Existences, as the Sun was the Father. The Jews, previous to, as well as after their metamorphosis ofJehovah into a male god, worshipped Astoreth, which made Isaiah declare: \"Your new moons and feasts my soul hateth,\"(i. 14); saying which, he was evidently unjust. Astoreth and the New-moon (the crescent argha) festivals, had no worsesignificance as a form of public worship than had the hidden meaning of the moon in general, which was Kabalisticallyconnected directly with, and sacred to, Jehovah, as is well known; with the sole difference that one was the female andthe other the male aspect of the moon, and of the star Venus.The Sun (the Father), the Moon (the Mother), and Mercury-Thoth (the Son), were the earliest Trinity of the Egyptians,who personified them in Osiris, Isis, and Thoth (Hermes). In [[PISTIS SOPHIA]], the seven great gods, divided into twotriads and the highest God (the Sun) are: the lower [[Tridunameis]], whose powers reside respectively in Mars, Mercuryand Venus; and the higher Triad (\"the three unseen gods\") who dwell in the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn; (vide §§ 359 and361 et seq).This requires no proof.

The navi, or ship-like form of the crescent, whichblends in itself all those common symbols of the ship of life, such as Noah's ark, the Yoni of the Hindus, and the ark of theCovenant, is the female symbol of the Universal \"Mothers of the gods,\" and is now found under its Christian symbol inevery Church, as the nave (from navis, the ship).* The navis -- the Sidereal vessel -- is fructified by the Spirit of Life -- themale God; or, as the learned Kenealy (in his Apocalypsis) calls it very appropriately -- the Holy Spirit. In Western religioussymbology the Crescent was the male, the full moon, the female aspect of that universal Spirit. \"The mystic word Alm,which the prophet Mahomet prefixed to many chapters of the Koran, alludes to her as the Alm, the immaculate Virgin ofthe heavens. And -- the sublime ever falling into the ridiculous -- it is from this root Alm that we have to derive the wordAlmeh -- the Egyptian dancing-girls. The latter are \"Virgins\" of the same type as the Nautchnis in India, and the (female)Kadeshim, the Holy Ones of the Jewish temples (those consecrated to Jehovah, who represented both sexes), whoseholy functions in the Israelite fanes were identical with those of the Nautchnis."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Now Eustathius declares that ([IO]) IO means the moon, in the dialect of the Argians; and it was one of the names of thesame in Egypt.

And here comes this linguistic same word from a source far moreancient; viz., the Coptic, or rather from the old Egyptian in time of the Coptic.\". . . . (From a MS.)This is the more remarkable when Egyptology compares this with the little which it knows about the Theban triad --composed of Ammon, Mouth, (or Mout) and their son Khonsoo. This triad was, when united, contained in the moon astheir common symbol; and when separated, it was Khonsoo who was the god, LUNUS, being thus confounded with Thotand Phtah. His mother Mout(h) -- the name signifying Mother, by the bye, not the moon, which was only her Symbol -- iscalled the \"Queen of Heaven\"; the \"Virgin,\" etc., etc., as she is an aspect of Isis, Hathor, and other mother goddesses.She was less the wife than the mother of Ammon, whose distinct title is \"the husband of his Mother.\" In a statuette atBoulaq, Cairo, this triad is represented (Number 1981 Serapeum, Greek Period) as a mummy-god holding in his handthree different sceptres, and bearing the lunar disc on his head, the characteristic tress of hair showing the design ofrepresenting it as that of an infant god, or \"the Sun,\" in the triad. He was the god of Destinies in Thebes, and appearsunder two aspects (1) as \"Khonsoo, the Lunar god, and Lord of Thebes, Nofir-hotpoo -- 'he who is in absolute repose';and (2) as Khonsoo Iri-sokhroo, or 'Khonsoo, who executes Destiny': the former preparing the events and conceivingthem for those born under his generative influence; the latter putting them into action.\" (See Maspero's Definitions). Undertheogonic permutations Ammon becomes Horus, HOR-AMMON, and Mout(h)-Isis is seen suckling him in a statuette ofthe Saitic period. (Abydos.) In his turn, in this transformed triad, Khonsoo becomes Thot-Lunus, \"he who operatessalvation.\" His brow is crowned with the head of an ibis decorated with the lunar disc and the diadem called IO-tef.Now all these symbols are certainly found reflected in (some believe them identical with) the Yave, or Jehovah of theBible.

If anything in the world can settle the dispute that the old, as much as thelater, Jews (post-Babylonian), and especially the former, built their theogony and religion on the very same foundation asall Pagans did, it is the work in question.And now it may be as well to remind the reader of that which was said of I A O, in our work, \"Isis Unveiled.\"\"No other deity affords such a variety of etymologies as Jaho, nor is there any name which can be so variouslypronounced. It is only by associating it with the Masoretic points that the later Rabbins succeeded in making Jehovahread 'Adonai' -- or Lord, as Philo Byblius spells it in Greek letters [[IEUO]] -- IEVO. Theodoret says that the Samaritanspronounced it Jahe (yahra), and the Jews Yaho; which would make it as we have shown, I -- Ah -- O. Diodorus states that'among the Jews they relate that Moses called the god Iao.'

Thus the first born of Brahma Prajapati(or any Demiurgos) indicates a measuring use of a circular relation taken from the Chakra (or Vishnu) and, as statedabove, the Divine manifestation takes the form of life and the first born.\"\"It is a most singular thing: At the entrance passage to the King's chamber the measurement from the surface of theGreat Step* and the Grand Gallery to the top of the said gallery, is by the very careful measures of Piazzi Smyth 339inches.[[diagram]]Take A as a centre and with this radius describe a circle; the diameter of that circle will be 339 x 2 = 678, and thesenumbers are those of the expression and the raven, in the 'Dove and raven' scenes or pictures of the Flood of Noah; (theradius is taken to show division into two parts, which are 1,065 each) for 113 (man) x 6 = 678; and the diameter to acircumference of 1,065 x 2 -- so we have here an indication of cosmic man on this high grade or step, at the entrance ofthe King's Chamber (the Holy of Holies) -- which is the womb. Now this passage is of such a height that a man to enter itmust stoop. But a man upright is 113, and broken, or stooping, he becomes 133 / 2 = 5.65 x 10, [[over]] [[hebrew]] orJehovah. That is, he personifies** him as entering the Holy of Holies. But by Hebrew Esotericism the chief function ofJehovah was child giving, etc., and that because, by the numbers of his name, he was the measure of the lunar year,which cycle of time, because by its factor of 7 (seven) it ran so co-ordinately with the periods of the quickening, viability,and gestation, was taken as the causative of the generative action and therefore was worshipped and besought.\"This discovery connects Jehovah still more with all the other creative and generative gods, solar and lunar, and especiallywith \"King\" Soma, the Hindu Deus Lunus, the moon, because of the esoteric influence attributed to this planet inOccultism.

The Hebrew words sacr and n'cabvah are, literally translated, lingham (phallus) and yoni,notwithstanding their translation in the Bible (Genesis i. v. 27.) \"male and female.\" As said there \"God creates 'Man in hisown image'. . . . . in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them,\" the androgyne Adam-Kadmon.Now this Kabalistic name is not that of a living man, nor even of a human or divine Being, but of the two sexes or organsof procreation, called in Hebrew with that usual sincerity of language pre-eminently Biblical, sacr and n'cabvah*; thesetwo being, therefore, the image under which the \"Lord God\" appeared usually to his chosen people. That this is so, is nowundeniably proven by almost all the symbologists and Hebrew scholars as well as by the Kabala. Therefore Adam is inone sense Jehovah. This makes plain another general tradition in the East mentioned in Gregorie's \"Notes andObservations upon several passages in Scripture\" (1684. Vol. 1 pp. 120-21) and quoted by Hargrave Jennings in hisPhallicism: \"That Adam was commanded by God that his dead body should be kept above ground till committed to themiddle of the earth by a priest of the most High God.\" Therefore, \"Noah daily prayed in the ark before the BODY OFADAM,\" or before the Phallus in the ark, or Holy of Holies, again. He who is a Kabalist and accustomed to the incessantpermutation of Biblical names, once they are interpreted numerically and symbolically, will understand what is meant.Jehovah, from the two words of which his name is composed, \"makes up the original idea of male-female as birth-originator, for the [[diagram]] was the membrum virile and Houak was Eve.\" So . . . \"the perfect one, as originator ofmeasures, takes also the form of birth origin, as hermaphrodite one; hence the phallic use of form.\" (\"Source of"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Measures,\" 159). Besides the same author shows and demonstrates numerically and geometrically that (a) Arets, earth,Adam, man, and H'Adam are cognate with each other, and are personified in the Bible under one form, as the Egyptianand Hebrew Mars, god of the generation; and (b) that Jehovah, or Jah, is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Jehovah says to Moses \"the Summation of my name is Sacr, the carrier of the germ\" -- phallus. \"It is the vehicle of theannunciation, and the sacr has passed down through ages to the sacr-factum of the Roman priest, and the sacr-fice, andsacrament of the English speaking race.\" (Source of Measures, p. 236) Thence marriage is a sacrament in the Greek andRoman Churches.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 468 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Noah, or Jehovah is Noah in Hebrew would be [[hebrew]], or literally in English, Inch.\"The above affords, then, a key to the said traditions. Noah, a divine permutation, the supposed saviour of Humanity, whocarries in his ark or argha (the moon), the germs of all living things, worships before the \"body of Adam,\" which body isthe image of, and a Creator itself. Hence Adam is called the \"Prophet of the Moon,\" the Argha or \"Holy of Holies\" of the[[hebrew]] (Yodh). This also shows the origin of the Jewish popular belief that the face of Moses is in the moon -- i.e., thespots in the Moon. For Moses and Jehovah are once more permutations, as has been shown Kabalistically. Says theauthor of the \"Source of Measures\" (p. 271): \"There is one fact in regard to Moses and his works too important to beomitted. When he is instructed by the Lord as to his mission, the power name assumed by the Deity is, I am that I am, theHebrew words being:--[[hebrew]]a various reading of [[hebrew]]. Now, Moses is [[hebrew]], and equals 345. Add the values of the new form of the nameJehovah, 21 + 501 + 21 = 543, or, by a reverse reading, 345; thus showing Moses to be a form of Jehovah in thiscombination. 21 ÷ 2 = 10.5, or, reversed, 501, so that the asher or the that in I am that I am is simply a guide to a use of21 or 7 x 3; 501 [[squared]] = 251 +, a very valuable pyramid number, etc., etc.For a clearer explanation for the benefit of non-Kabalists we put it thus: \"I am that I am\" is in Hebrew:--Ahiye Asher Ahiye[[hebrew]] [[hebrew]] [[hebrew]]5, 10, 5, 1 200, 300, 1 5, 10, 5, 1Add the numbers of these separate words and you have:--[[hebrew]] [[hebrew]] [[hebrew]]21 501 21(which relates to the process of descending in fire on the mount to make man, etc., etc.), and which is explained to be buta check and use of the numbers of the mountains; for:-- on one side we have 10 + 5 + 6 = 21, down the middle 501, andon the other side 6 + 5 + 10 = 21.\" (From the same author.) (Vide § XXII., \"The Symbolism of the Mystery Name IAO.\")The \"Holy of Holies,\" both Kabalistic and Rabbinical, are thus shown as an international symbol, and common property.Neither has originated with the Hebrews; but owing to the too realistic handling of the half-initiated Levites, the symbolhas with them acquired a significance which it hardly has with any other people to this day,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 469 THE OLD AND THE NEW JEHOVAH.and which it was originally never meant to have by the true Kabalist. The Lingham and Yoni of the modern average Hinduis, on the face of it, of course, no better than the Rabbinical \"Holy of Holies,\" -- but it is no worse; and this is a pointgained on the Christian traducers of the Asiatic religious philosophies. For, in such religious myths, in the hiddensymbolism of a creed and philosophy, the spirit of the tenets propounded ought to decide their relative value. And whowill say, that, examined either way, this so-called \"Wisdom,\" applied solely to the uses and benefit of one little nation, hasever developed in it anything like national ethics. The Prophets are there, to show the walk in life, before, during, andafter the days of Moses, of the chosen but \"stiff-necked\" people. That they have had at one time the Wisdom-Religion anduse of the universal language and its symbols at their disposal and in their possession, is proved by the same esotericismexisting to this day in India with regard to the \"Holy of Holies.\" This, as said, was and still is the passage through the\"golden\" cow in the same stooping position as the one shown in the gallery of the pyramid, which identified man withJehovah in Hebrew esotericism. The whole difference lies in the Spirit of Interpretation. With the Hindus as with theancient Egyptians that spirit was and is entirely metaphysical and psychological; with the Hebrews it was realistic andphysiological. It pointed to the first sexual separation of the human race (Eve giving birth to Cain-Jehovah, as shown inthe \"Source of Measures\"); to the consummation of terrestrial physiological union and conception (as in the allegory ofCain shedding Abel's blood -- Habel, the feminine principle) and -- child-bearing; a process shown to have begun in theThird Race, or with Adam's THIRD son, Seth, with whose son Henoch, men began to call themselves Jehovah or Jah-hovah, the male Jod and Havah or Eve -- to wit, male and female beings.* Thus the difference lies in the religious andethical feeling, but the two symbols are identical. There is no doubt that, with the fully initiated Judaean Tanaim, the innersense of the symbolism was as holy in its abstraction as with the ancient Aryan Dwijas. The worship of the \"god in theark\" dates only from David; and for a thousand years Israel knew of no phallic Jehovah. And now the old Kabala, editedand re-edited, has become tainted with it.With the ancient Aryans the hidden meaning was grandiose, sublime, and poetical, however much the externalappearance of their symbol may now militate against the claim.

With theSemite, that stooping man meant the fall of Spirit into matter, and that fall and degradation were apotheosized by him withthe result of dragging Deity down to the level of man. For the Aryan, the symbol represented the divorce of Spirit frommatter, its merging into and return to its primal Source; for the Semite, the wedlock of spiritual man with material femalenature, the physiological being taking pre-eminence over the psychological and the purely immaterial. The Aryan views ofthe symbolism were those of the whole Pagan world; the Semite interpretations emanated from, and were pre-eminentlythose of a small tribe, thus marking its national features and the idiosyncratic defects that characterize many of the Jewsto this day -- gross realism, selfishness, and sensuality. They had made a bargain, through their father Jacob, with theirtribal deity, self-exalted above all others, and a covenant that his \"seed shall be as the dust of the earth\"; and that deitycould have no better image henceforth than that of the symbol of generation, and, as representation, a number andnumbers.Carlyle has wise words for both these nations. With the Hindu Aryan -- the most metaphysical and spiritual people onearth -- religion has ever been, in his words, \"an everlasting lode-star, that beams the brighter in the heavens the darkerhere on earth grows the night around him.\" The religion of the Hindu detaches him from this earth; therefore, even now,the cow-symbol is one of the grandest and most philosophical among all others in its inner meaning. To the \"MASTERS\"and \"Lords\" of European potencies -- the Israelites -- certain words of Carlyle apply still more admirably; for them \"religionis a wise prudential feeling grounded on mere calculation\" -- and it was so from its beginnings. Having burdenedthemselves with it, Christian nations feel bound to defend and poetise it, at the expense of all other religions.But it was not so with the ancient nations. For them the passage entrance and the sarcophagus in the King's chambermeant regeneration -- not generation. It was the most solemn symbol, a Holy of Holies, indeed, wherein were createdimmortal Hierophants and \"Sons of God\" -- never mortal men and Sons of lust and flesh -- as now in the hidden sense ofthe Semite Kabalist. The reason for the difference in the views of the two races is easy to account for. The Aryan Hindubelongs to the oldest races now on earth; the Semite Hebrew to the latest. One is nearly one------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 471]] THE CRAFT OF THE RABBINS.million years old; the other is a small sub-race some 8,000 years old and no more.*But Phallic worship has developed only with the gradual loss of the keys to the inner meaning of religious symbols; andthere was a day when the Israelites had beliefs as pure as the Aryans have. But now Judaism, built solely on Phallicworship, has become one of the latest creeds in Asia, and theologically a religion of hate and malice toward everyoneand everything outside themselves. Philo Judaeus shows what was the genuine Hebrew faith. The sacred Writings, hesays, prescribe what we ought to do . . . commanding us to hate the heathen and their laws and institutions. They didhate Baal or Bacchus worship publicly, but left its worst features to be followed secretly; and it is with the Talmudic Jewsthat the grand symbols of nature were the most profaned. With them, as now shown by the discovery of the key to thecorrect Bible reading -- Geometry, the fifth divine Science (\"fifth\" -- because it is the fifth key in the series of the SevenKeys to the Universal esoteric language and symbology) was desecrated, and by them applied to conceal the mostterrestrial and grossly sexual mysteries, wherein both Deity and religion were degraded.We are told that it is just the same with our Brahma-prajapati, with Osiris and all other creative gods. Quite so, when theirrites are judged exoterically and externally; the reverse when their inner meaning is unveiled, as we see. The HinduLingham is identical with \"Jacob's Pillar\" -- most undeniably. But the difference, as said, seems to consist in that theesoteric significance of the Lingham was too truly sacred and metaphysical to be revealed to the profane and the vulgar;hence its superficial appearance was left to the speculations of the mob. Nor would the Aryan Hierophant and Brahmin, intheir proud exclusiveness and the satisfaction of their knowledge, go to the trouble of concealing its primeval nakednessunder cunningly devised fables; whereas the Rabbi, having interpreted the symbol to suit his own tendencies, had to veilthe crude significance; and this served a double purpose -- that of keeping his secret to himself and of exalting himself[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Strictly speaking, the Jews are an artificial Aryan race, born in India, and belonging to the Caucasian division. No onewho is familiar with the Armenians and the Parsis can fail to recognize in the three the same Aryan, Caucasian type.From the seven primitive types of the Fifth Race there now remain on Earth but three. As Prof. W. H. Flower aptly said in1885, \"I cannot resist the conclusion so often arrived at by various anthropologists -- that the primitive man, whatever hemay have been, has in the course of ages diverged into three extreme types, represented by the Caucasian of Europe,the Mongolian of Asia, and the Ethiopian of Africa, and that all existing individuals of the species can be ranged aroundthese types. . . . \" (The President's address at the Anthrop.

Viraj and Horus are both male symbols, emanating from androgyneNature, one from Brahma and his female counterpart Vach, the other, from Osiris and Isis -- never from the One infiniteGod. In the Judaeo-Christian systems it is different. Whereas the lotus, containing Brahma, the Universe, is showngrowing out of Vishnu's navel, the Central point in the Waters of Infinite Space, and whereas Horus springs from the lotusof the Celestial Nile -- all these abstract pantheistic ideas are dwarfed and made terrestrially concrete in the Bible: one isalmost inclined to say that in the esoteric they are grosser and still more anthropomorphic, than in their exotericrendering. Take as an example the same symbol, even in its Christian application; the lilies in the hand of the ArchangelGabriel (Luke i. 28). In Hinduism -- the \"Holy of Holies\" is a universal abstraction, whose dramatis personae are InfiniteSpirit and Nature; in Christian Judaism, it is a personal God, outside of that Nature, and the human Womb -- Eve, Sarah,etc., etc.; hence, an anthropomorphic phallic god, and his image -- man.Thus it is maintained, that with regard to the of the Bible, one of two hypotheses has to be admitted.

We say it was theformer; and that, therefore, the secret or esoteric worship of the Jews was the same Pantheism that the Vedantinphilosophers are reproached with to-day; Jehovah was a substitute for purposes of an exoteric national faith, and had noimportance or reality in the eyes of the erudite priests and philosophers -- the Sadducees, the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Whenever such analogies between the Gentiles and the Jews, and later the Christians, were pointed out, it was theinvariable custom of the latter to say that it was the work of the Devil who forced the Pagans to imitate the Jews for thepurpose of throwing a slur on the religion of the one, true living God. To this Faber says very justly \"Some have imaginedthat the Gentiles were servile copyists of the Israelites, and that each point of similitude was borrowed from the MosaicalInstitutes. But this theory will by no means solve the problem: both because we find the very same resemblance in theceremonies of nations far different from Palestine, as we do in the rites of those who are in its immediate vicinity, andbecause it seems incredible that all should have borrowed from one which was universally disliked and despised.\" (PaganIdol.

For how could those who invented the stupendous scheme now known as the Bible, or theirsuccessors who knew, as all Kabalists do, that it was so invented for a popular blind -- how could they, we ask, feelreverence for such a phallic symbol and a NUMBER, as Jehovah is shown most undeniably to be in the Kabalistic works?How could anyone worthy of the name of a philosopher, and knowing the real secret meaning of their \"pillar of Jacob,\"their Bethel, oil-anointed phalli, and their \"Brazen Serpent,\" worship such a gross symbol, and minister unto it, seeing in ittheir \"Covenant\" -- the Lord Himself! Let the reader turn to Gemara Sanhedrin and judge. As various writers have shown,and as brutally stated in Hargrave Jennings' Phallicism (p. 67) \"We know from the Jewish records that the Ark containeda table of stone. . . . that stone was phallic, and yet identical with the sacred name Jehovah . . . which written in unpointedHebrew with four letters, is J-E-V-E or JHVH (the H being merely an aspirate and the same as E). This process leaves usthe two letters I and V (in another form U); then if we place the I in the U we have the 'Holy of Holies'; we also have theLingha and Yoni and Argha of the Hindus, the Isvara and 'supreme Lord'; and here we have the whole secret of its mysticand arc-celestial import, confirmed in itself by being identical with the Linyoni (?) of the Ark of the Covenant.\"The Biblical Jews of to-day do not date from Moses but from David -- even admitting the identity of the old genuine withthe later and remodelled Mosaic scrolls. Before that time their nationality is lost in the mists of prehistoric darkness, theveil from which is now withdrawn as much as we have space to do so. It is only to the days of the Babylonian captivitythat the Old Testament may be referred by the most lenient criticism, as the approximately correct views that were currentabout the days of Moses.

Mr. Horne, have toadmit the numerous changes and alterations made by the later compilers of the \"Book of God,\" since it was found byHilkiah (See \"Introduction to the Old Testament,\" and also Bishop Colenso's \"Elohistic and Jehovistic writers\"); and that\"the Pentateuch arose out of the primitive or older documents, by means of a SUPPLEMENTARY One.\" The Elohistictexts were re-written 500 years after the date of Moses; the Jehovistic 800, on the authority of the Bible chronology itself.Hence, it is maintained that the deity, represented as the organ of generation in his pillar form, and as a symbol of thedouble-sexed organ in the numeral value of the letters of his name, or [[hebrew]] the Yodh (phallus), and [[hebrew]] He(the opening, or------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 474 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Womb) according to Kabalistic authority -- is of a far later date than the Elohim symbols and is borrowed from thePagan exoteric rites; and Jehovah is thus on a par with the Lingham and Yoni found on every road-side in India.Just as the IAO of the mysteries was distinct from Jehovah, so was the later Iao and Abraxas of some Gnostic sectsidentical with the god of the Hebrews, who was the same with the Egyptian Horus. This is undeniably proven on\"heathen\" as on the Gnostic \"Christian\" gems. In Matter's collection of such gems there is a \"Horus\" seated on the lotus,inscribed [[ABRASAXIAO]] (Abraxas Iao) -- an address exactly parallel to the so frequent [[EIS ZETS SARAPI]] (Eis zetssarapi) on the contemporary Heathen gems; and therefore only to be translated by \"Abraxas is the One Jehovah\" (King'sGnostics, p. 327). But who was Abraxas? As the same author shows -- \"the numerical or Kabalistic value of the nameAbraxas directly refer to the Persian title of the god 'Mithra,' Ruler of the year, worshipped from the earliest times underthe appellation of Iao.\" Thus, the Sun, in one aspect, the moon or the Lunar genius, in another, that generative deity"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"whom the Gnostics saluted as \"Thou that presidest over the Mysteries of the Father and the Son, who shinest in thenight-time, holding the second rank, the first Lord of Death.\"It is only in his capacity of the genius of the moon, the latter being credited in the old cosmogony with being the parent ofour Earth, that Jehovah could ever be regarded as the creator of our globe and its Heaven, namely, the Firmament.The knowledge of all this will be no proof, however, to the average bigot. Missionaries will go on with the most virulentattacks on the religions of India, and Christians read with the same benighted smile of satisfaction as ever thesepreposterously unjust words of Coleridge, \"It is highly worthy of observation that the inspired writings received byChristians are distinguishable from all other books PRETENDING TO INSPIRATION, from the Scriptures of theBrahmins, and even from the Koran, in their strong and frequent recommendation of TRUTH (! !). . . .\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 475 NATURE, A STONE-COLD MOTHER.§ XVIII.ON THE MYTH OF THE \"FALLEN ANGEL,\" IN ITS VARIOUS ASPECTS.-------A.THE EVIL SPIRIT: WHO, AND WHAT?OUR present quarrel is exclusively with theology. The Church enforces belief in a personal god and a personal devil,while Occultism shows the fallacy of such a belief. And though for the Pantheists and Occultists, as much as for thePessimists, Nature is no better than \"a comely mother, but stone cold\" -- this is true only so far as regards externalphysical nature. They both agree that, to the superficial observer, she is no better than an immense slaughter-housewherein butchers become victims, and victims executioners in their turn. It is quite natural that the pessimistically inclinedprofane, once convinced of Nature's numerous shortcomings and failures, and especially of her autophagouspropensities, should imagine this to be the best evidence that there is no deity in abscondito within Nature, nor anythingdivine in her. Nor is it less natural that the materialist and the physicist should imagine that everything is due to blind forceand chance, and to the survival of the strongest, even more often than of the fittest. But the Occultists, who regardphysical nature as a bundle of most varied illusions on the plane of deceptive perceptions; who recognise in every painand suffering but the necessary pangs of incessant procreation: a series of stages toward an ever-growing perfectibility,which is visible in the silent influence of never-erring Karma, or abstract nature -- the Occultists, we say, view the greatMother otherwise. Woe to those who live without suffering. Stagnation and death is the future of all that vegetates withouta change. And how can there be any change for the better without proportionate suffering during the preceding stage? Isit not those only who have learnt the deceptive value of earthly hopes and the illusive allurements of external nature whoare destined to solve the great problems of life, pain, and death?If our modern philosophers -- preceded by the medieval scholars -- have helped themselves to more than onefundamental idea of antiquity, theologians have built their God and his Archangels, their Satan and his Angels, along withthe Logos and his staff, entirely out of the dramatis personae of the old heathen Pantheons. They would have been------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 476 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.welcome to these, had they not cunningly distorted the original characters, perverted the philosophical meaning, andtaking advantage of the ignorance of Christendom -- the result of long ages of mental sleep, during which humanity waspermitted to think only by proxy -- tossed every symbol into the most inextricable confusion. One of their most sinfulachievements in this direction, was the transformation of the divine alter ego into the grotesque Satan of their theology.As the whole philosophy of the problem of evil hangs upon the correct comprehension of the constitution of the innerbeing of nature and man, of the divine within the animal, and hence also the correctness of the whole system as given inthese pages, with regard to the crown piece of evolution -- MAN -- we cannot take sufficient precautions againsttheological subterfuges. When the good St. Augustine and the fiery Tertullian called the Devil \"the monkey of God,\" thiscould be attributed to the ignorance of the age they lived in. It is more difficult to excuse our modern writers on the sameground. The translation of Mazdean literature has afforded to the Roman Catholic writers the pretext for proving theirpoint in the same direction once more. They have taken advantage of the dual nature of Ahura Mazda in the Zend Avestaand the Vendidad, and of his Amshaspends, to emphasize still further their wild theories. Satan is the plagiarist and thecopyist by anticipation of the religion which came ages later. This was one of the master strokes of the Latin Church, itsbest trump-card after the appearance of Spiritualism in Europe. Though only a succes d'estime, in general, even amongthose who are not interested in either Theosophy or Spiritualism, yet the weapon is often used by the Christian (RomanCatholic) Kabalists against the Eastern Occultists.Now even the Materialists are quite harmless, and may be regarded as the friends of Theosophy, when compared tosome fanatical \"Christian\" (as they call themselves, \"Sectarian\" as we call them) Kabalists, on the Continent. These readthe Zohar, not to find in it ancient Wisdom, but to discover in its verses, by mangling the texts and meaning, Christiandogmas, where none could ever have been meant; and, having fished them out with the collective help of jesuiticalcasuistry and learning, the supposed \"Kabalists\" proceed to write books and to mislead less far-sighted students of theKabala.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Such a pseudo-Kabalist was the Marquis de Mirville in France, who, having studied the Zohar and other old remnants ofJewish Wisdom under the \"Chevalier\" Drach, an ancient Rabbi Kabalist converted to the Romish Church -- wrote with his"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"help half a dozen volumes full of slander and calumnies against every prominent Spiritualist and Kabalist.

We need not go out of the way tocompare the pagan demons of either Egypt, India, or Chaldea with the devil of Christianity, for no such comparison ispossible. But we may stop to glance at the biography of the Christian Devil, a piratical reprint from the Chaldeo-Judaeanmythology:--The primitive origin of this personification rests upon the Akkadian conception of the cosmic powers -- the Heavens andthe Earth -- in eternal feud and struggle with Chaos. Their Silik-Muludag, \"the God amongst all the Gods,\" the \"mercifulguardian of men on Earth,\" was the Son of Hea (or Ea) the great God of Wisdom, called by the Babylonians Nebu. Withboth peoples -- as in the case of the Hindu gods -- their deities were both beneficent and maleficent. As Evil andpunishment are the agents of Karma, in an absolutely just retributive sense, so Evil was the servant of the good (HibbertLect. 1887, pp. 101-115). The reading of the Chaldeo-Assyrian tiles has now demonstrated it beyond a shadow of doubt.We find the same idea in the Zohar. Satan was a Son, and an Angel of God. With all the Semitic nations, the Spirit of theEarth was as much the Creator in his own realm as the Spirit of the Heavens. They were twin brothers andinterchangeable in their functions, when not two in one. Nothing of that which we find in Genesis is absent from theChaldeo-Assyrian religious beliefs, even in the little that has hitherto been deciphered. The great \"Face of the Deep\" ofGenesis is traced in the Tohu-bohu, \"Deep,\" \"Primeval Space,\" or Chaos of the Babylonians. Wisdom (the Great UnseenGod) -- called in Genesis chap. i. the \"Spirit of God\" -- lived, for the older Babylonians as for the Akkadians, in the Sea ofSpace. Toward the days described by Berosus, this sea became the visible waters on the face of the Earth -- thecrystalline abode of the great mother, the mother of Ea and all the gods, which became, still later, the great DragonTiamat, the Sea Serpent. Its last stage of development was the great struggle of Bel with the Dragon -- the Devil!Whence the Christian idea that God cursed the Devil? The God of the Jews, whomsoever he was, forbids cursing Satan.Philo Judaeus and Josephus both state that the Law (the Pentateuch and the Talmud) undeviatingly forbid one to cursethe adversary, as also the gods of the gentiles. \"Thou shalt not revile the gods,\" quoth the god of Moses (Exodus xxii. 28),for it is God who \"hath divided (them) unto all nations\" (Deut. iv. 19); and those who speak evil of------------------------------------------------------------------------ [[Vol. 2, Page]] 478 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"Dignities\" (gods) are called \"filthy dreamers\" by Jude (8). For even Michael the Archangel durst not bring against him(the devil) a railing accusation, but said: \"The Lord rebuke thee\" (ibid 9). Finally the same is repeated in the Talmud.*\"Satan appeared one day to a man who used to curse him daily, and said to him: 'Why dost thou this?' Consider that Godhimself would not curse me, but merely said: 'The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.' \"**This bit of Talmudic information shows plainly two things: (a) that St. Michael is called \"God\" in the Talmud, andsomebody else \"the Lord\"; and (b) that Satan is a God, of whom even the \"Lord\" is in fear. All we read in the Zohar andother Kabalistic works on Satan shows plainly that this \"personage\" is simply the personification of the abstract evil, whichis the weapon of Karmic law and KARMA. It is our human nature and man himself, as it is said that \"Satan is always nearand inextricably interwoven with man.\" It is only a question of that Power being latent or active in us.It is a well-known fact -- to learned Symbologists at all events -- that in every great religion of antiquity, it is the LogosDemiurge (the second logos), or the first emanation from the mind (Mahat), who is made to strike, so to say, the key-noteof that which may be called the correlation of individuality and personality in the subsequent scheme of evolution. TheLogos it is, who is shown in the mystic symbolism of cosmogony, theogony, and anthropogony, playing two parts in thedrama of Creation and Being, i.e., that of the purely human personality and the divine impersonality of the so-calledAvatars, or divine incarnations, and of the universal Spirit, called Christos by the Gnostics, and the Farvarshi (or Ferouer)of Ahura Mazda in the Mazdean philosophy. On the lower rungs of theogony the celestial Beings of lower Hierarchies hadeach a Farvarshi, or a celestial \"Double.\" It is the same, only a still more mystic, reassertion of the Kabalistic axiom,\"Deus est Demon inversus\"; the word \"demon,\" however, as in the case of Socrates, and in the spirit of the meaninggiven to it by the whole of antiquity, standing for the guardian Spirit, an \"Angel,\" not a devil of Satanic descent, astheology will have it. The Roman Catholic Church shows its usual logic and consistency by accepting, as the ferouer ofChrist, St. Michael, who was \"his Angel Guardian,\" as proved by St. Thomas,*** while he calls the prototypes of Michaeland his synonyms, such as Mercury, for example, devils[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide Isis Unveiled, Vol. II., 487, et seq.** Treat.

[[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 479 GOD AND DEVIL, BOTH METATRONS.The Church accepts positively the tenet that Christ has his Ferouer as any other god or mortal has. Writes de Mirville:\"Here we have the two heroes of the Old Testament, the Verbum (?), or the second Jehovah, and his face ('Presence,' asthe Protestants translate) forming both but one, and yet being two, a mystery which seemed to us unsolvable before we"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"had studied the doctrine of the Mazdean ferouers, and learnt that the ferouer was the spiritual potency, at once image,face, and the guardian of the Soul which finally assimilates the ferouer.\" (Memoires a l'Academie, Vol. v., p. 516.) This isalmost correct.Among other absurdities, the Kabalists maintain that the word metatron being divided into [[meta, thronon]], means nearthe throne. It means quite the reverse, as meta means \"beyond\" and not \"near.\" This is of great importance in ourargument. St. Michael, then, the quis ut Deus, is the translator, so to speak, of the invisible world into the visible and theobjective.They maintain, furthermore, along with the Roman Catholic Church, that in the Biblical and Christian theology there doesnot exist a \"higher celestial personality, after the Trinity, than that of the Archangel or the Seraphim, Michael.\" Accordingto them, the conqueror of the Dragon is \"the archisatrap of the sacred militia, the guardian of the planets, the King of theStars, the slayer of Satan and the most powerful Rector.\" In the mystic astronomy of these gentlemen, he is \"theconqueror of Ahriman, who having upset the sidereal throne of the usurper, bathes in his stead in the solar fires\"; and,defender of the Christ-Sun, he approaches so near his Master, \"that he seems to become one with him . . . . Owing to thisfusion with the WORD (Verbum) the Protestants, and among them Calvin, ended by losing sight entirely of the duality,and saw no Michael but only his Master,\" writes the Abbe Caron. The Roman Catholics, and especially their Kabalists,know better; and it is they who explain to the world this duality, which affords to them the means of glorifying the chosenones of the Church, and of rejecting and anathematizing all those Gods who may be in the way of their dogmas.Thus the same titles and the same names are given in turn to God and the Archangel. Both are called Metatron, \"bothhave the name of Jehovah applied to them when they speak one in the other\" (sic) as, according to the Zohar, the termsignifies equally \"the Master and the Ambassador.\" Both are the Angel of the Face, because, as we are informed, if, onthe one hand, the \"Word\" is called \"the face (or the Presence) and the image of the substance of God,\" on the other,\"when[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] O living image of Divinity!

In Fargard XIX. of the Vendidad it is said (verse 14), \"Invoke, O Zarathustra! myFarvarshi, who am Ahura Mazda, the greatest, the best, the fairest of all beings, the most solid, the most intelligent, . . . .and whose soul is the Holy Word\" (Mathra Spenta). The French Orientalists translate Farvarshi by \"Ferouer.\"Now what is a Ferouer, or Farvarshi? In some Mazdean works (e.g., Ormazd Ahriman, §§ 112, 113), it is plainly impliedthat Farvarshi is the inner, immortal man (or that Ego which reincarnates); that it existed before its physical body andsurvives all such it happens to be clothed in. \"Not only man was endowed with the Farvarshi, but gods too, and the sky,fire, waters, and plants.\" (Introduction to the Vendidad, by J. Darmesteter). This shows as plainly as can be shown thatthe ferouer is the \"spiritual counterpart\" of whether god, animal, plant, or even element, i.e., the refined and the purer partof the grosser creation, the soul of the body, whatever the body may happen to be. Therefore does Ahura Mazdarecommend Zarathustra to invoke his Farvarshi and not himself (Ahura-Mazda); that is to say, the impersonal and trueEssence of Deity, one with Zoroaster's own Atman (or Christos), not the false and personal appearance. This is quiteclear.Now it is on this divine and ethereal prototype that the Roman Catholics seized so as to build up the supposed differencebetween their god and angels, and the deity and its aspects, or the gods of the old religions. Thus, while calling Mercury,Venus, Jupiter (whether as gods or planets) DEVILS, they yet make of the same Mercury the ferouer of their Christ. Thisfact is undeniable. Vossius (De Idol., II., 373)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Isaiah, lxiii. 8-9.** Metator and [[hegemon]].*** \"La Face et le Representant du Verbe,\" p. 18, de Mirville.**** That which is called in the Vendidad \"Farvarshi,\" the immortal part of an individual, that which outlives man -- theHigher Ego, say the Occultists, or the divine Double.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 481 FRAUDULENT TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE.proves that Michael is the Mercury of the pagans, and Maury and other French writers corroborate him, and add that\"according to great theologians Mercury and the Sun are one,\" (?) and no wonder, they think, since \"Mercury being sonear the Wisdom of the Verbum (the Sun), must be absorbed by and confounded with him.\""},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"This \"pagan\" view was accepted from the first century of our era, as shown in the ORIGINAL Acts of the Apostles (theEnglish translation being worthless). So much is Michael the Mercury of the Greeks and other nations, that when theinhabitants of Lystra mistook Paul and Barnabas for Mercury and Jupiter -- \"the gods have come down to us in thelikeness of men,\" -- verse 12 (xiv.) adds: \"And they called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul, Hermes (or Mercury), because hewas the leader of the WORD (Verbum),\" and not \"the chief speaker,\" as erroneously translated in the authorised, andrepeated even in the revised, English Bible. Michael is the angel in the Vision, the Son of God, \"who was like unto a Sonof Man.\" It is the Hermes-Christos of the Gnostics, the Anubis-Syrius of the Egyptians, the Counsellor of Osiris in Amenti,the Michael leontoid [[ophiomorphos]] of the Ophites, who wears on certain Gnostic jewels a lion head, like his fatherIldabaoth. (See King's Gnostics.)Now to all this the Roman Catholic Church consents tacitly, many of her writers avowing it publicly. And, unable to denythe flagrant \"borrowing\" of their Church, who \"spoilt\" the symbols of her seniors, as the Jews had \"spoilt\" the Egyptians oftheir jewels of silver and gold, they explain the fact quite coolly and as seriously. Thus the writers who were hitherto timidenough to see, in this repetition by Christian dogmas of old Pagan ideas, \"a legendary plagiarism perpetrated by man,\"are gravely assured that, far from such a simple solution of the almost perfect resemblance, it has to be attributed to quiteanother cause: \"to a prehistorical plagiarism, of a superhuman origin.\"If the reader would know how, he must kindly turn to the same fifth volume of de Mirville's work. Please note that thisauthor was the official and recognised defender of the Roman Church, and was helped by the learning of all the Jesuits.On page 518 we read:--\"We have pointed out several demi-gods, and also very historical heroes of the pagans, who were predestined from themoment of their birth, to ape while dishonouring it, the nativity of the hero, who was quite God, before whom the wholeearth had to bow; we traced them being born as he was, from an immaculate mother; we saw them strangling serpents intheir cradles, fighting against demons, performing miracles, dying as martyrs, descending to the nether world and risingagain from the dead. And we have bitterly deplored that timid and shy Christians should feel compelled to explain all suchidentities on the ground of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 482 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.coincidence of myth and symbol. They forgot apparently these words of the Saviour: 'ALL THAT CAME BEFORE MEARE THIEVES AND ROBBERS,' a word which explains all without any absurd negation and which I commented in thesewords 'The Evangel is a sublime drama, parodied and played before its appointed time by ruffians.' \"The \"ruffians\" (les droles), are of course demons whose manager is Satan. Now this is the easiest and the most sublimeand simple way of getting out of the difficulty! The Rev. Dr. Lundy, a Protestant de Mirville, followed the happy suggestionin his \"Monumental Christianity,\" and so did Dr. Sepp of Munich in his works written to prove the divinity of Jesus and theSatanic origin of all other Saviours. So much greater the pity that a systematic and collective plagiarism, which went onfor several centuries on the most gigantic scale, should be explained by another plagiarism, this time in the fourth Gospel.For the sentence quoted from it, \"All that ever came before me, etc.,\" is a verbatim repetition of words written in the \"Bookof Enoch\" lxxxix. In the Introduction to Archbishop Lawrence's translation of it from an Ethiopic MS. in the BodleianLibrary, the editor, author of the \"Evolution of Christianity,\" remarks:--\"In revising the proof-sheets of the Book of Enoch . . . . . the parable of the sheep, rescued by the good Shepherd fromhireling guardians and ferocious wolves, is obviously borrowed by the fourth Evangelist from Enoch, lxxxix., in which theauthor depicts the shepherds as killing . . . the sheep before the advent of their Lord, and thus discloses the true meaningof that hitherto mysterious passage in the Johannine parable -- 'All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers' --language in which we now detect an obvious reference to the allegorical shepherds of Enoch.\"It is too late in the day to claim that it is Enoch who borrowed from the New Testament, instead of vice versa. Jude (14-15) quotes verbatim from Enoch a long passage about the coming of the Lord with his 10,000 saints, and namingspecifically the prophet, acknowledges the source. This \"parallelism between prophet and apostle, have placed beyondcontroversy that, in the eyes of the author of an Epistle accepted as divine revelation, the Book of Enoch was the inspiredproduction of an antediluvian patriarch . . . \" and further \" . . . the cumulative coincidence of language and ideas in Enochand the authors of N.T. Scripture, . . . clearly indicates that the work of the Semitic Milton was the inexhaustible sourcefrom which Evangelists and Apostles, or the men who wrote in their names, borrowed their conceptions of theresurrection, judgment, immortality, perdition, and of the universal reign of righteousness under the eternal dominion ofthe Son of Man. This Evangelical plagiarism culminates in the Revelation of John, which adapts the visions------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 483 VEDAS, ONCE UNIVERSAL.of Enoch to Christianity, with modifications in which we miss the sublime simplicity of the great Master of apocalypticprediction, who prophesied in the name of the antediluvian Patriarch.\" (INT. xxxv.)\"Antediluvian,\" truly; but if the phraseology of the text dates hardly a few centuries or even millenniums before thehistorical era, then it is no more the original prediction of the events to come, but, in its turn, a copy of some scripture of aprehistoric religion. . . . . \"In the Krita age, Vishnu, in the form of Kapila and other (inspired sages) . . . imparts to the worldtrue wisdom as Enoch did. In the Treta age he restrains the wicked, in the form of a universal monarch (the Chakravartinor the 'Everlasting King' of Enoch*) and protects the three worlds (or races). In the Dwapara age, in the person of Veda-Vyasa, he divides the one Veda into four, and distributes it into hundreds (Sata) of branches.\" Truly so; the Veda of theearliest Aryans, before it was written, went forth into every nation of the Atlanto-Lemurians, and sowed the first seeds ofall the now existing old religions. The off-shoots of the never dying tree of wisdom have scattered their dead leaves evenon Judaeo-Christianity. And at the end of the Kali, our present age, Vishnu, or the \"Everlasting King\" will appear as Kalki,and re-establish righteousness upon earth. The minds of those who live at that time shall be awakened, and become aspellucid as crystal. \"The men who are thus changed by virtue of that peculiar time (the sixth race) shall be as the seeds of"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"other human beings, and shall give birth to a race who shall follow the laws of the Krita age of purity\"; i.e., it shall be theseventh race, the race of \"Buddhas,\" the \"Sons of God,\" born of immaculate parents.-------B.THE GODS OF LIGHT PROCEED FROM THE GODS OF DARKNESS.Thus it is pretty well established that Christ, the Logos, or the God in Space and the Saviour on Earth, is but one of theechoes of the same antediluvian and sorely misunderstood Wisdom. The history begins by the descent on Earth of the\"Gods\" who incarnate in mankind, and this is the FALL. Whether Brahma hurled down on Earth in the allegory byBhagavant, or Jupiter by Kronos, all are the symbols of the human races. Once landed on, and having touched this planetof dense matter, no snow-white wings of the highest angel can remain immaculate, or the Avatar (or incarnation) beperfect, as every such Avatar is[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Saith Uriel (chap. xxvi. v. 3), in the \"Book of Enoch\" \"all those who have received mercy shall for ever bless God theeverlasting King,\" who will reign over them.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 484 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the fall of a God into generation. Nowhere is the metaphysical truth more clear, when explained esoterically, or morehidden from the average comprehension of those who instead of appreciating the sublimity of the idea can only degrade,than in the Upanishads, the esoteric glossaries of the Vedas. The Rig-Veda, as Guignault characterized it, \"is the mostsublime conception of the great highways of Humanity.\" The Vedas are, and will remain for ever, in the esotericism of theVedanta and the Upanishads, \"the mirror of the eternal Wisdom.\"For over sixteen centuries the new masks, forced on the faces of the old gods, have screened them from public curiosity,but they have finally proved a misfit. Yet the metaphorical FALL, and as metaphorical atonement and crucifixion, ledWestern Humanity through roads knee-deep in blood. Worse than all, they led it to believe in the dogma of the evil spiritdistinct from the spirit of all good, whereas the former lives in all matter and pre-eminently in man. Finally it created theGod-slandering dogma of Hell and eternal perdition; it spread a thick film between the higher intuitions of man and divineverities; and, most pernicious result of all, it made people remain ignorant of the fact that there were no fiends, no darkdemons in the Universe before man's own appearance on this, and probably on other earths. Henceforth the people wereled to accept, as the problematical consolation for this world's sorrows, the thought of original sin.The philosophy of that law in Nature, which implants in man as well as in every beast a passionate, inherent, andinstinctive desire for freedom and self-guidance, pertains to psychology and cannot be touched on now. To show thefeeling in higher Intelligences, to analyse and give a natural reason for it, would necessitate, moreover, an endlessphilosophical explanation for which there is no room here. Perhaps, the best synthesis of this feeling is found in threelines of Milton's Paradise Lost. Says the \"Fallen One\":--\"Here we may reign secure; and in my choice,To reign is worth ambition, though in hell!Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven . . . .\"Better be man, the crown of terrestrial production and king over its opus operatum, than be lost among the will-lessspiritual Hosts in Heaven.We have said elsewhere that the dogma of the first Fall rested on a few verses in Revelation; these verses being nowshown a plagiarism from Enoch by some scholars. These grew into endless theories and speculations, which graduallyacquired the importance of dogma and inspired tradition. Every one wanted to explain the verse about the seven-headeddragon with his ten horns and seven crowns, whose tail------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 485 THE SONS OF ETERNITY.\"drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth,\" and whose place, with that of his angels, \"wasfound no more in heaven.\" What the seven heads of the Dragon (cycle) mean, and its five wicked kings also, may belearned in the Addenda which close Part III. of this Volume.From Newton to Bossuet speculations were incessantly evolved in Christian brains with regard to these obscure verses. .. . . \"The star that falls, is the heresiarch Theodosius\" . . . . explains Bossuet. \"The clouds of smoke, are the heresies ofthe Montanists. . . . . The third part of the stars, are the martyrs, and especially the doctors of divinity. . . . .\"Bossuet ought to have known, however, that the events described in Revelation were not original, and may, as shown, befound in other and pagan traditions. There were no scholastics nor Montanists during Vedic times, nor yet far later inChina. But Christian theology had to be protected and saved.This was only natural. But why should truth be sacrificed in order to protect from destruction the lucubrations of Christiantheologians?The princeps aeris hujus, the \"prince of the air\" of St. Paul, is not the devil, but the effects of the astral light, as EliphasLevi correctly explains.

The \"clouds of smoke\" are a geological phenomenon. The \"third part of thestars of heaven\" cast down to the earth -- refers to the divine Monads, (the Spirits of the Stars in Astrology) thatcircumambulate our globe; i.e., the human Egos destined to perform the whole cycle of incarnations. This sentence, quicircumambulat terram, however, is again referred to the DEVIL in theology, the mythical father of Evil being said to \"falllike lightning.\" Unfortunately for this interpretation, the \"Son of Man,\" or Christ, is expected, on the personal testimony ofJesus, to descend on earth likewise, \"As the lightning cometh out of the East,\"* just in the same shape and under thesame symbol as Satan, who is seen \"as lightning to fall from heaven.\"** All these metaphors and figures of speech, pre-eminently Oriental in their character, must have their origin searched for in the East. In all the ancient cosmogonies lightcomes from darkness. In Egypt, as elsewhere, darkness was \"the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Matthew xxiv. 27.** Luke x. 18.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 486 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.principle of all things.\" Hence Pymander, the \"Thought divine,\" issues as light from DARKNESS. Behemoth* is theprinciple of Darkness, or Satan, in Roman Catholic Theology, and yet Job says of him that \"Behemoth is the chief(principle) of the ways of God\" (xl. 19) -- \"Principium viarum Domini Behemoth!\"Consistency does not seem to be a favourite virtue in any portion of divine Revelation, so-called -- not as interpreted bytheologians, at any rate.The Egyptians and the Chaldeans referred the birth of their divine Dynasties to that period when creative Earth was in herlast final throes, in giving birth to her prehistoric mountain ranges, which have since disappeared, her seas and hercontinents. Her face was covered with \"deep Darkness and in that (Secondary) Chaos was the principle of all things\" thatdeveloped on the globe later on. And our geologists have ascertained that there was such a terrestrial conflagration in theearly geological periods, several hundred millions of years ago.** As to the tradition itself, every country and nation had it,each under its respective national form.It is not alone Egypt, Greece, Scandinavia or Mexico, that had their Typhon, Python, Loki and its \"falling\" Demon, butChina, also. The Celestials have a whole literature upon the subject. In King, it is said that in consequence of a rebellionagainst Ti of a proud Spirit who said he was Ti himself, seven choirs of celestial spirits were exiled upon earth, which\"brought a change in all nature, heaven itself bending down and uniting with earth.\"And in the \"Y-King,\" one reads: \"The flying Dragon, superb and rebellious, suffers now, and his pride is punished; hethought he would reign in heaven, he reigns only on the earth.\"Again, the Tchoon-Tsieoo says allegorically: \"one night the stars ceased shining in darkness, and deserted it, falling downlike rain upon the earth, where they are now hidden.\" These stars are the Monads.Chinese cosmogonies have their \"Lord of the Flame\" and their \"Celestial Virgin,\" with little \"Spirits to help and minister toher; and big Spirits to fight those who are the enemies of other gods.\" But all this does not prove that the said allegoriesare presentments or prophetic writings which all refer to Christian theology.The best proof one can offer to Christian Theologians that the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Protestant Bible defines Behemoth innocently -- \"The elephant as some think\" (See marginal note in Job xl. 19) inthe authorised versions.** Astronomy, however, knows nothing of stars that have disappeared unless from visibility, never from existence, sincethe Science of Astronomy became known. Temporary stars are only variable stars, and it is believed even that the newstars of Kepler and Tycho Brahe may still be seen.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 487 THE SHADOWS OF THE SHADOWS.esoteric meaning in the Bible -- in both Testaments -- was the assertion of the same idea as in our Archaic teachings -- towit, that the \"Fall of the Angels\" referred simply to the incarnation of angels \"who had broken through the Seven Circles\" -- is found in the Zohar. Now the Kabala of Simeon Ben Iochai is the soul and essence of its allegory, as the later ChristianKabala is the \"dark cloaked\" Mosaic Pentateuch. And it says (in the Agrippa MSS.):\"The wisdom of the Kabala rests in the science of the equilibrium and Harmony.\"\"Forces that manifest without having been first equilibrized perish in space\" (\"equilibrized\" meaning differentiated).\"Thus perished the first Kings (the Divine Dynasties) of the ancient world, the self-produced Princes of giants. They felllike rootless trees, and were seen no more: for they were the Shadow of the Shadow\"; to wit, the chhaya of the ShadowyPitris.

Nowthe collective Mind -- the Universal -- composed of various and numberless Hosts of Creative Powers, however infinite inmanifested Time, is still finite when contrasted with the unborn and undecaying Space in its supreme essential aspect.That which is finite cannot be perfect. Therefore there are inferior Beings among those Hosts, but there never were anydevils or \"disobedient Angels,\" for the simple reason that they are all governed by Law. The Asuras who incarnated (callthem by any other name), followed in this a law as implacable as any other. They had manifested prior to the Pitris, andas time (in Space) proceeds in Cycles, their turn had come -- hence the numerous allegories (Vide \"Demon est Deusinversus,\" Part II., Vol. I.). The name of Asura was first given by the Brahmans indiscriminately to those who opposedtheir mummeries and sacrifices, as the great Asura called \"Asurendra\" did. It is to those ages, probably, that the origin ofthe idea of the demon, as opposer and adversary, has to be traced.The Hebrew Elohim, called in the translations \"God,\" and who create \"light,\" are identical with the Aryan Asuras. They arealso------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 488 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.referred to as the \"Sons of Darkness\" as a philosophical and logical contrast to light immutable and eternal. The earliestZoroastrians did not believe in Evil or Darkness being co-eternal with Good or Light, and they give the sameinterpretation. Ahriman is the manifested shadow of AHURA-MAZDA (Asura-mazda), himself issued from ZeruanaAkerne \"boundless (circle of) Time\" or the Unknown Cause. \"Its glory,\" they say of the latter, \"is too exalted, its light tooresplendent for either human intellect or mortal eye to grasp and see.\" Its primal emanation is eternal light, which, fromhaving been previously concealed in DARKNESS was called to manifest itself and thus was formed Ormazd, the \"King ofLife.\" He is the \"first-born\" in BOUNDLESS TIME, but, like his own antitype (pre-existing Spiritual idea), has lived withindarkness from all eternity. The six Amshaspends (seven with himself, chief of all), the primitive Spiritual Angels and Menare collectively his Logos. The Zoroastrian Amshaspends create the world in six days or periods also, and rest on theSeventh; whereas that Seventh is the first period or \"day,\" in esoteric philosophy, (Primary creation in the Aryancosmogony). It is that intermediate AEon which is the Prologue to creation, and which stands on the borderland betweenthe uncreated eternal Causation and the produced finite effects; a state of nascent activity and energy as the first aspectof the eternal immutable Quiescence. In Genesis, on which no metaphysical energy has been spent, but only anextraordinary acuteness and ingenuity to veil the esoteric Truth, \"Creation\" begins at the third stage of manifestation.\"God\" or the Elohim are the \"Seven Regents\" of Pymander. They are identical with all the other Creators.But even in Genesis that period is hinted at by the abruptness of the picture, and the \"darkness\" that was on the face ofthe deep. The Alahim are shown to \"create\" -- that is to say, to build or to produce the two or \"double heaven\" (notHeaven and Earth); which means, in so many words, that they separated the upper manifested (angelic) heaven, or planeof consciousness, from the lower or terrestrial plane; the (to us) eternal and immutable AEons from those periods that arein space, time and duration; Heaven from Earth, the unknown from the KNOWN -- to the profane. Such is the meaning ofthe sentence in Pymander, which says that: \"THOUGHT, the divine, which is LIGHT and LIFE (Zeruana Akerne)produced through its WORD, or first aspect,\" the other, operating THOUGHT, which being the god of Spirit and Fire,constructed seven Regents enclosing within their circle the world of Senses, named \"fatal destiny.\" The latter refers toKarma; the \"seven circles\" are the seven planets and planes, as also the seven invisible Spirits, in the angelic spheres,whose visible symbols are the seven planets,* the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Another proof, if any were needed, that the ancient Initiates knew of more than seven planets is to be found in theVishnu Purana, Book II., ch. xii., where, describing [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 489 THE ONE PASSIVE DEITY.seven Rishis of the great Bear and other glyphs. As said of the Adityas by Roth: \"they are neither sun, nor moon, norstars, nor dawn, but the eternal sustainers of this luminous life which exists as it were behind all these phenomena.\"It is they -- the \"Seven Hosts\" -- who, having \"considered in their Father (divine Thought) the plan of the operator,\" assays Pymander, desired to operate (or build the world with its creatures) likewise; for, having been born \"within thesphere of operation\" -- the manifesting Universe -- such is the Manvantaric LAW. And now comes the second portion ofthe passage, or rather of two passages merged into one to conceal the full meaning. Those who were born within thesphere of operation were \"the brothers who loved him well.\" The latter -- the \"him\" -- were the primordial angels: theAsuras, the Ahriman, the Elohim -- or \"Sons of God,\" of whom Satan was one -- all those spiritual beings who were calledthe \"Angels of Darkness,\" because that darkness is absolute light, a fact now neglected if not entirely forgotten intheology. Nevertheless, the spirituality of those much abused \"Sons of Light\" which is Darkness, must be evidently asgreat in comparison with that of the Angels next in order, as the ethereality of the latter would be, when contrasted withthe density of the human body. The former are the \"First-born\"; therefore so near to the confines of pure quiescent Spiritas to be merely the \"PRIVATIONS\" -- in the Aristotelian sense -- the ferouers or the ideal types of those who followed.They could not create material, corporeal things; and, therefore, were said in process of time to have refused to create, ascommanded by \"God\" -- otherwise, TO HAVE REBELLED."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Perchance, this is justified on that principle of the Scientific theory which teaches us about light and sound and the effectof two waves of equal length meeting. \"If the two sounds be of the same intensity, their coincidence produces a soundfour times the intensity of either, while their interference produces absolute silence.\"Explaining some of the \"heresies\" of his day, Justin Martyr shows the identity of all the world religions at their startingpoints. The first beginning opens invariably with the unknown and PASSIVE deity, from which emanates a certain activepower or virtue, the Mystery that is sometimes called WISDOM, sometimes the SON, very often God, Angel, Lord, andLOGOS.* The latter is sometimes applied to the very first emanation, but in several systems it proceeds from the firstandrogyne or double ray produced at the beginning by the unseen. Philo depicts this wisdom as male and female.

A thing can only exist through its opposite -- Hegelteaches us, and only a little philosophy and spirituality are needed to comprehend the origin of the later dogma, which isso truly satanic and infernal in its cold and cruel wickedness. The Magians accounted for the origin of evil in their exotericteachings in this way. \"Light can produce nothing but light, and can never be the origin of evil\"; how then was the evilproduced, since there was nothing co-equal or like the Light in its production? Light, say they, produced several Beings,all of them spiritual, luminous, and powerful. But a GREAT ONE (the \"Great Asura,\" Ahriman, Lucifer, etc., etc.) had anevil thought, contrary to the Light. He doubted, and by that doubt he became dark.This is a little nearer to the truth, but still wide of the mark. There was no \"EVIL thought\" that originated the opposingPower, but simply THOUGHT per se; something which, being cogitative, and containing design and purpose, is thereforefinite, and must thus find itself naturally in opposition to pure quiescence, the as natural state of absolute Spirituality andPerfection. It was simply the law of Evolution that asserted itself; the progress of mental unfolding, differentiated fromspirit, involved and entangled already with matter, into which it is irresistibly drawn. Ideas, in their very nature andessence, as conceptions bearing relation to objects, whether true or imaginary, are opposed to absolute THOUGHT, thatunknowable ALL of whose mysterious operations Mr. Spencer predicates that nothing can be said, but that \"it has nokinship of nature with Evolution\" (Principles of Psychology,**** 474) -- which it certainly has not.The Zohar gives it very suggestively. When the \"Holy One\" (the Logos) desired to create man, he called the highest hostof Angels and said to them what he wanted, but they doubted the wisdom of this desire and answered: \"Man will notcontinue one night in his glory\" -- for[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* A division indicative of time.** Sanchoniathon calls time the oldest AEon, Protogonos, the \"first-born.\"*** Philo Judaeus: \"Cain and his Birth,\" p. xvii.**** It is suggestive of that spirit of paradoxical negation so conspicuous in our day, that while the evolution hypothesishas won its rights of citizenship in science as taught by Darwin and Haeckel, yet both the eternity of the Universe and thepre-existence of a universal consciousness, are rejected by the modern psychologists. \"Should the Idealist be right, thedoctrine of evolution is a dream,\" says Mr. Herbert Spencer.

Then he called another, lower Host, and said the same. Andthey contradicted the \"Holy One\": \"What is the good of Man?\" they argued. Still Elohim created man, and when mansinned there came the hosts of Uzza and Azael, and twitted God: \"Here is the Son of Man that thou hast made,\" theysaid. \"Behold, he sinned!\" Then the Holy One replied: \"If you had been among them (men) you would have been worsethan they.\" And he threw them from their exalted position in Heaven even down on the Earth; and \"they were changed(into men) and sinned after the women of the earth\"; (Zohar, 9, b.). This is quite plain. No mention is made in Genesis ofthese \"Sons of God\" (chap. vi.) having been punished for it. The only reference to it in the Bible is in Jude (6). \"And theangels which kept not their first estate but left their habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness untothe judgment of the great day.\" And this means simply that the \"Angels,\" doomed to incarnation, are in the chains of fleshand matter, under the darkness of ignorance, till the \"Great Day,\" which will come as always after the seventh round, afterthe expiration of the \"Week,\" on the SEVENTH SABBATH, or in the post-Manvantaric Nirvana.How truly esoteric and consonant with the Secret Doctrine is \"PYMANDER the Thought Divine\" of Hermes, may beinferred from its original and primitive translations in Latin and Greek only. On the other hand how disfigured it has beenlater on by Christians in Europe, is seen from the remarks and unconscious confessions made by de St. Marc, in hisPreface and letter to the Bishop of Ayre, in 1578. Therein, the whole cycle of transformations from a Pantheistic and"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Egyptian into a mystic Roman Catholic treatise is given, and we see how PYMANDER has become what it is now. Still,even in St. Marc's translation, traces are found of the real PYMANDER -- the \"Universal Thought\" or \"MIND.\" This is theverbatim translation from the old French translation, the original being given in the foot-note* in its quaint old French:--\"Seven men (principles) were generated in Man.\" \"The nature of the harmony of the Seven of the Father and of the Spirit.Nature . . . .[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"SECTION 16 (chap. i., Mercure Trismegiste -- PIMANDRE . . . . \" \"Oh, ma pensee, que s'ensuit il? car je desiregrandement ce propos.

The primary Breath informs thehigher Hierarchies; the secondary -- the lower, on the constantly descending planes.Now there are many passages in the Bible which prove on their face, exoterically, that this belief was at one timeUniversal; and the most convincing are the two chapters Ezekiel xxviii. and Isaiah xiv. Christian theologians are welcometo interpret both as referring to the great War before Creation, the Epos of Satan's rebellion, etc., if they so choose, butthe absurdity of the idea is too apparent. Ezekiel addresses his lamentations and reproofs to the King of Tyre; Isaiah -- toKing Ahaz, who indulged in the worship of idols, as did the rest of the nation, with the exception of a few Initiates (theProphets, so called), who tried to arrest it on its way to exotericism, or idolatry, which is the same thing. Let the studentjudge.In Ezekiel xxviii. it is said, \"Son of Man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, thus saith the Lord God (as we understand it, the\"god\" KARMA): Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said I am a God . . . . and yet thou art a man . . . . behold Ishall bring strangers upon thee . . . . and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom . . . . and theyshall bring thee down to the pit . . . .\" or Earth-life.The origin of the \"prince of Tyrus\" is to be traced to, and sought in------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 493 THE REAL MEANING OF THE CHERUB.the \"divine Dynasties\" of the iniquitous Atlanteans, the Great Sorcerers (See last Comments, on Stanza XII., verses 47-49). There is no metaphor in the words of Ezekiel, but actual history, this time. For the voice in the prophet, the voice ofthe \"Lord,\" his own Spirit, which spake unto him, says:-- \"Because thou hast said, 'I am a God, I sit in the seat of God(s) --(divine Dynasties), in the midst of the seas,' yet thou art a man. . . . . Behold thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secretthat they can hide from thee: with thy wisdom . . . thou hast increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because ofthy riches. Behold therefore . . . strangers shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom . . . they shall bringthee down . . . and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.\" (Verses 3-8.) All suchimprecations are not prophecy, but simply reminders of the fate of the Atlanteans, the \"Giants on Earth.\"What can be the meaning of this last sentence if it is not a narrative of the fate of the Atlanteans? Verse 17 saying, \"thineheart was lifted up because of thy beauty,\" may refer to the \"Heavenly Man\" in Pymander, or to the Fallen Angels, whoare accused of having fallen through pride on account of the great beauty and wisdom which became their lot. There isno metaphor here, except in the preconceived ideas of our theologians, perhaps. These verses relate to the Past andbelong more to the Knowledge acquired at the mysteries of Initiation than to retrospective clairvoyance! Says the voice,again:--\"Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God (in the Satya Yuga) every precious stone was thy covering . . . . theworkmanship of thy tabrets and thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day thou was created. . . Thou art the anointed"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"cherub . . . thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire . . . thou wast perfect in thy ways from the daythat thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. Therefore I will cast thee out of the mountain of God and destroythee. . . . \"The \"Mountain of God\" means the \"Mountain of the Gods\" or Meru, whose representative in the Fourth Race was MountAtlas, the last form of one of the divine Titans, so high in those days that the ancients believed that the heavens rested onits top. Did not Atlas assist the giants in their war against the gods? (Hyginus). Another version shows the fable as arisingfrom the fondness of Atlas, son of Iapetus and Clymene, for astronomy, and from his dwelling for that reason on thehighest mountain peaks. The truth is that Atlas, \"the mountain of the gods,\" and also the hero of that name, are theesoteric symbols of the Fourth Race, and his seven daughters, the Atlantides, are the symbols of its Seven Sub-races.Mount Atlas, according to all the legends, was three times as high as it is now; having sunk at two different times. It is of avolcanic origin, and therefore the voice------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 494 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.within Ezekiel says: \"I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee,\" etc. (v. 18). Surely it does notmean, as seems to be the case from the translated texts, that this fire was to be brought from the midst of the Prince ofTyrus, or his people, but from Mount Atlas, symbolising the proud race, learned in magic and high in arts and civilization,whose last remnant was destroyed almost at the foot of the range of those once gigantic mountains.Truly, \"thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more\"; as the very name of the race and its fate is nowannihilated from man's memory. Bear in mind, that almost every ancient King and priest was an initiate; that from towardthe close of the Fourth Race there had been a feud between the Initiates of the Right and those of the Left Path; finally,that the garden of Eden is referred to by other personages than the Jews of the Adamic race, since even Pharaoh iscompared to the fairest tree of Eden by this same Ezekiel, who shows \"all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best ofLebanon, . . . comforted in the nether parts of the earth . . .,\" for \"they also went down into hell with him\" (Pharaoh)* untothe nether parts, which are in fact the bottom of the ocean, whose floor gaped wide to devour the lands of the Atlanteansand themselves. If one bears all this in mind and compares the various accounts, then one will find out that the whole ofchapters xxviii. and xxxi. of Ezekiel relate neither to Babylon, Assyria, nor yet Egypt, since none of these have been sodestroyed, but simply fell into ruins on the surface, not beneath the earth -- but indeed to Atlantis and most of its nations.And he will see that the \"garden of Eden\" of the Initiates was no myth, but a locality now submerged. Light will dawn uponhim, and he will appreciate such sentences as these at their true esoteric value: \"Thou hast been in Eden; . . . thou wastupon the holy mountain of God\" -- for every nation had and many still have holy mountains: some, Himalayan Peaks,others, Parnassus, and Sinai. They were all places of initiation and the abodes of the chiefs of the communities of ancientand even modern adepts. And again: \"Behold, the Assyrian (why not Atlantean, Initiate?) was a cedar in Lebanon; . . . hisheight was exalted above all the trees; . . . . the cedars in the garden of God could not hide him, . . . so that all the trees ofEden . . . . envied him\" (Ezekiel xxxi. 3-9).Throughout all Asia Minor, the Initiates were called the \"trees of Righteousness,\" and the cedars of Lebanon, as alsowere some kings of Israel. So were the great adepts in India, but only the adepts of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The only Pharaoh whom the Bible shows going down into the Red Sea was the king who pursued the Israelites, andwho remained unnamed, for very good reasons, perhaps.

When Vishnu Purana narrates that \"the world was overrun with trees,\" while the Prachetasas -- who \"passed10,000 years of austerity in the vast ocean\" -- were absorbed in their devotions, the allegory relates to the Atlanteans andthe adepts of the early Fifth Race -- the Aryans. Other \"trees (adept Sorcerers) spread, and overshadowed theunprotected earth; and the people perished . . . unable to labour for ten thousand years.\" Then the sages, the Rishis ofthe Aryan race, called Prachetasas, are shown \"coming forth from the deep,\"* and destroying by the wind and flameissuing from their mouths, the iniquitous \"trees\" and the whole vegetable kingdom; until Soma (the moon), the sovereignof the vegetable world, pacifies them by making alliance with the adepts of the Right Path, to whom he offers as brideMarisha, \"the offspring of the trees.\"** This means that which is given in the Stanzas and Commentaries, and what is alsogiven in Part II. of Vol. I., \"The Sacred Island.\" It hints at the great struggle between the \"Sons of God\" and the Sons ofthe Dark Wisdom -- our forefathers; or the Atlantean and the Aryan Adepts.The whole History of that period is allegorized in the Ramayana, which is the mystic narrative in epic form of the strugglebetween Rama -- the first king of the divine dynasty of the early Aryans -- and Ravana, the symbolical personation of theAtlantean (Lanka) race. The former were the incarnations of the Solar Gods; the latter, of the lunar Devas. This was thegreat battle between Good and Evil, between white and black magic, for the supremacy of the divine forces, or of thelower terrestrial or cosmic powers. If the student would understand better the last statement, let him turn to the Anugitaepisode of the Mahabharata, chapter v., where the Brahmana tells his wife, \"I have perceived by means of the Self theseat abiding in the Self -- (the seat) where dwells the Brahman free from the pairs of opposites and the moon, togetherwith the fire (or the sun), upholding (all) beings (as), the mover of the intellectual principle.\" The moon is the deity of themind (Manas) but only on the lower plane. \"Manas is dual -- lunar in the lower, solar in its upper portion,\" says acommentary.

The Ramayana -- every line of which has to be read esoterically -- discloses in magnificent symbolism andallegory the tribulations of both man and soul. \"Within the body, in the midst of all these life-winds (? principles), whichmove about in the body, and swallow up one another,* blazes the Vaishvana fire** sevenfold, of which 'I' am the goal,\"says the Brahmana.***But the chief \"Soul\" is Manas or mind; hence, Soma, the moon, is shown as making an alliance with the solar portion in it,personified as the Prachetasas. But of the seven keys that open the seven aspects of the Ramayana, as of every otherScripture, this is only one -- the metaphysical.The symbol of the \"Tree\" standing for various Initiates was almost universal. Jesus is called \"the tree of Life,\" as also allthe adepts of the good Law, while those of the left Path are referred to as the \"withering trees.\" John the Baptist speaks of\"the axe\" which \"is laid to the root of the trees\" (Matth. iii. 10); and the King of Assyria's armies are called trees (Isaiah x.19).The true meaning of the Garden of Eden was sufficiently given in \"Isis Unveiled.\"The writer has more than once heard surprise expressed that Isis should contain so few of the doctrines now taught. Thisis quite erroneous. For the allusions to such teachings are plentiful, even if the teachings themselves were still withheld.The time had not arrived then, as the hour has not struck now to say all. \"No Atlanteans, or the Fourth Race whichpreceded our Fifth Race, are mentioned in 'Isis Unveiled,' \" a critic on \"Esoteric Buddhism\" wrote one day.

On the strength of hazy metaphors scattered throughout the prophets, and in St. John'sRevelation, a grand but re-edited version of the Book of Enoch, on these insecure grounds Christian theology built itsdogmatic Epos of the War in Heaven. It did more: it used the symbolical visions, intelligible only to the Initiates, as pillarsupon which to support the whole bulky edifice of its religion; and now the pillars have been found very weak reeds, andthe cunning structure is foundering. The entire Christian scheme rests upon these Jakin and Boaz -- the two contraryforces of good and evil, Christ and Satan the [[agathai kai kakai dunameis]]. Take away from Christianity its main prop ofthe Fallen Angels, and the Eden Bower vanishes with its Adam and Eve into thin air; and Christ, in the exclusivecharacter of the One God and Saviour, and the victim of Atonement for the Sin of animal-man, becomes forthwith auseless, meaningless myth.In an old number of the Revue Archaeologique for the year 1845 (p. 41), a French writer, M. Maury, remarks:-- \"Thisuniversal strife between good and bad spirits seems to be only the reproduction of another more ancient and more terriblestrife, that, according to an ancient myth, took place before the creation of the universe, between the faithful and therebellious legions.\"Once more, it is a simple question of priority. Had John's Revelation been written during the Vedic period, and were notone sure now of its being simply another version of the Book of Enoch and the Dragon legends of pagan antiquity -- thegrandeur and the beauty of the imagery might have biased the critics' opinion in favour of the Christian interpretation ofthat first war, whose battle field was starry Heaven, and the first slaughterers -- the Angels. As the matter stands now,however, one has to trace Revelation, event by event, to other and far older visions. For the better comprehension of theApocalyptic allegories and of the esoteric epos we ask the reader to turn to Revelation, and to read chapter xii., fromverse 1 to verse 7.This has several meanings, most of which have been found out with regard to the astronomical and numerical keys of thisuniversal myth. That which may be given now, is a fragment, a few hints as to its secret meaning, as embodying therecord of a real war, the struggle between the Initiates of the two schools. Many and various are the still existingallegories built on that same foundation stone. The true narrative, that which gives the full esoteric meaning, is in theSecret books, but the writer has had no access to these."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"In the exoteric works, however, the episode of the Taraka war, and some esoteric commentaries, may offer a clueperhaps. In every Purana------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 498 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the event is described with more or less variations, which show its allegorical character.In the Mythology of the earliest Vedic Aryans as in the later Puranic narratives, mention is made of Budha, the \"Wise\";one \"learned in the Secret Wisdom,\" and who is the planet Mercury in his euhemerization. The Hindu Classical Dictionarycredits Budha with being the author of a hymn in the Rig Veda. Therefore, he can by no means be \"a later fiction of theBrahmins,\" but is a very old personation indeed.It is by inquiring into his genealogy, or theogony, rather, that the following facts are disclosed. As a myth, he is the son ofTara, the wife of Brihaspati the \"gold coloured,\" and of \"Soma\" the (male) Moon, who, Paris-like, carries this new Helen ofthe Hindu sidereal Kingdom away from her husband, which causes a great strife and war in Swarga (Heaven). Theepisode brings on a battle between the gods and the Asuras: King Soma, finds allies in Usanas (Venus), the leader of theDanavas; and the gods are led by Indra and Rudra, who side with Brihaspati. The latter is helped by Sankara (Siva), who,having had for his guru Brihaspati's father, Angiras, befriends his son. Indra is here the Indian prototype of Michael, theArchistrategus and the slayer of the \"Dragon's\" angels -- since one of his names is Jishnu \"leader of the (celestial) Host.\"Both fight, as some Titans did against other Titans in defence of revengeful gods, one -- of Jupiter tonans (in India,Brihaspati is the planet Jupiter, which is a curious coincidence); the other, in support of the ever-thundering RudraSankara. During this war, he is deserted by his body-guard, the storm-gods (Maruts). The story is very suggestive insome of its details.Let us examine some of them, and seek to discover their meaning.The presiding genius, or \"regent\" of the planet Jupiter is Brihaspati, the wronged husband. He is the instructor or spiritualguru of the gods, who are the representatives of the procreative powers. In the Rig Veda, he is called Brahmanaspati, aname meaning \"the deity in whom the action of the worshipped upon the gods is personified.\" Hence Brahmanaspatirepresents the materialization of the divine grace, so to say, by means of ritual and ceremonies, or the exoteric worship.\"TARA\"* -- his wife -- is on the other hand the personification of the powers of one initiated into Gupta Vidya (secretknowledge), as will be shown.SOMA is the moon astronomically; but in mystical phraseology, it is also the name of the sacred beverage drunk by theBrahmins and the Initiates during their mysteries and sacrificial rites. The \"Soma\" plant is the asclepias acida, whichyields a juice from which that mystic beverage,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Dowson's Classical Dictionary.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 499 ALLEGORIES ON THE \"WAR IN HEAVEN.\"the Soma drink, is made. Alone the descendants of the Rishis, the Agnihotri (the fire priests) of the great mysteries knewall its powers. But the real property of the true Soma was (and is) to make a new man of the Initiate, after he is reborn,namely once that he begins to live in his astral body (See \"The Elixir of Life\"*); for, his spiritual nature overcoming thephysical, he would soon snap it off and part even from that etherealized form.**Soma was never given in days of old to the non-initiated Brahman -- the simple Grihasta, or priest of the exoteric ritual.Thus Brihaspati -- \"guru of the gods\" though he was -- still represented the dead-letter form of worship. It is Tara his wife -- the symbol of one who, though wedded to dogmatic worship, longs for true wisdom -- who is shown as initiated into hismysteries by King Soma, the giver of that Wisdom. Soma is thus made in the allegory to carry her away. The result of thisis the birth of Budha -- esoteric Wisdom -- (Mercury, or Hermes in Greece and Egypt). He is represented as \"so beautiful,\"that even the husband, though well aware that Budha is not the progeny of his dead-letter worship -- claims the \"new-born\" as his Son, the fruit of his ritualistic and meaningless forms.*** Such is, in brief, one of the meanings of the allegory.War in Heaven refers to several events of that kind on various and different planes of being. The first is a purelyastronomical and cosmical fact pertaining to cosmogony. Mr. John Bentley thought that with the Hindus war in Heaven isonly a figure referring to their calculations of time periods (see Bentley's Hindu Astronomy).****[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See \"Five Years of Theosophy.\"** The partaker of Soma finds himself both linked to his external body, and yet away from it in his spiritual form. The latter,freed from the former, soars for the time being in the ethereal higher regions, becoming virtually \"as one of the gods,\" andyet preserving in his physical brain the memory of what he sees and learns. Plainly speaking, Soma is the fruit of the Treeof Knowledge forbidden by the jealous Elohim to Adam and Eve or Yah-ve, \"lest Man should become as one of us.\"*** We see the same in the modern exoteric religions.**** \"Historical Views of Hindu Astronomy.\" Quoting from the work in reference to Aryachatta, who is said to give a nearapproach to the true relation among the various values for the computations of the value of [[pi]], the author of the\"Source of Measures\" reproduces a curious statement.

And this very formulation of Mr.Bentley will strangely exemplify the assertion; and explained, will show that it (the Hindu exoteric astronomy andsciences) was derived from a system exact beyond the European one, in which Mr. Bentley himself, of [[Footnotecontinued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 500 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.This served as a prototype, he thinks, for the Western nations to build their war of the Titans upon. The author is not quitewrong, but neither is he quite right. If the sidereal prototype refers indeed to a pre-manvantaric period, and rests entirelyon the Knowledge claimed by the Aryan Initiates of the whole programme and progress of cosmogony,* the war of theTitans is but a legendary and deified copy of the real war that took place in the Himalayan Kailasa (heaven) instead of inthe depths of Cosmic interplanetary Space. It is the record of the terrible strife between the \"Sons of God\" and the \"Sonsof the Shadow\" of the Fourth and the Fifth Races. It is on these two events, blended together by legends borrowed fromthe exoteric account of the war waged by the Asuras against the gods, that every subsequent national tradition on thesubject has been built.Esoterically, the Asuras, transformed subsequently into evil Spirits and lower gods, who are eternally at war with the greatdeities -- are the gods of the Secret Wisdom. In the oldest portions of the Rig Veda, they are the spiritual and the divine,the term Asura being used for the Supreme Spirit and being the same as the great Ahura of the Zoroastrians. (SeeDarmesteter's VENDIDAD). There was a time when the gods Indra, Agni, and Varuna themselves belonged to theAsuras.In the Aitareya Brahmana, the breath (asu) of Brahma-Prajapati became alive, and from that breath he created theAsuras. Later on, after the war, the Asuras are called the enemies of the gods, hence -- \"A-suras,\" the initial \"A\" being anegative prefix -- or \"no-gods\" -- the \"gods\" being referred to as \"Suras.\" This then connects the Asuras and their \"Hosts,\"enumerated further on, with the \"Fallen Angels\" of the Christian Churches, a hierarchy of spiritual Beings to be found inevery Pantheon of ancient and even modern nations -- from the Zoroastrian down to that of the Chinaman. They are thesons of the primeval Creative Breath at the beginning of every new Maha Kalpa, or Manvantara; in the same rank as theAngels who had remained \"faithful.\" These were the allies of Soma (the parent of the Esoteric Wisdom) as againstBrihaspati (representing ritualistic or ceremonial[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] course, trusted as far in advance of the Hindu Knowledge, at any time, in anygeneration.\"Which is Mr. Bentley's misfortune, and does not take away from the glory of the ancient Hindu astronomers, who were allInitiates.* The Secret Doctrine teaches that every event of universal importance, such as geological cataclysms at the end of onerace and the beginning of a new one, involving a great change each time in mankind, spiritual, moral and physical -- ispre-cogitated and preconcerted, so to say, in the sidereal regions of our planetary system. Astrology is built wholly uponthis mystic and intimate connection between the heavenly bodies and mankind; and it is one of the great secrets ofInitiation and Occult mysteries.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 501 SARPAS -- SERPENTS -- NAGAS.worship). Evidently they have been degraded in Space and Time into opposing powers or demons by the ceremonialists,on account of their rebellion against hypocrisy, sham-worship, and the dead-letter form.Now what is the real character of all those who fought along with them? They are (1) the Usanas, or the \"host\" of theplanet Venus, become now in Roman Catholicism -- Lucifer, the genius of the \"morning star\" (see Isaiah xiv., 12), thetsaba, or army of \"Satan.\" (2) The Daityas and Danavas are the Titans, the demons and giants whom we find in the Bible(Gen. vi.) -- the progeny of the \"Sons of God\" and the \"Daughters of Men.\" Their generic name shows their allegedcharacter, and discloses at the same time the secret animus of the Brahmins: for they are the Krati-dwishas -- the\"enemies of the sacrifices\" or exoteric shams. These are the \"hosts\" that fought against Brihaspati, the representative ofexoteric popular and national religions; and Indra -- the god of the visible heaven, the firmament, who, in the early Veda,is the highest god of Cosmic heaven, the fit habitation for an extra-Cosmic and personal God, higher than whom noexoteric worship can ever soar.(3) Then come the Nagas,* the Sarpa (serpents or Seraphs). These, again, show their character by the hidden meaningof their glyph. In Mythology they are semi-divine beings with a human face and the tail of a Dragon. They are therefore,undeniably, the Jewish seraphim (from Serapis and Sarpa, Serpent); the plural being saraph, \"burning, fiery\" (See Isaiah,vi. 23). Christian and Jewish angelology distinguishes between the Seraphim and the Cherubim or Cherubs, who comesecond in order; esoterically, and Kabalistically, they are identical; the cherubim being simply the name for the images orlikenesses of any of the divisions of the celestial hosts. Now, as said before, the Dragons and Nagas were the namesgiven to the Initiates-hermits, on account of their great Wisdom and Spirituality and their living in caves. Thus, whenEzekiel applies the adjective of Cherub to the King of Tyre, and tells him that by his wisdom and his understanding thereis no secret that can be hidden from him (v. 3, 4, xxviii.), he shows to an Occultist that it is a \"prophet,\" perhaps, still afollower of exoteric worship, who fulminates against an Initiate of another school and not against an imaginary Lucifer, afallen cherub from the stars, and then from the garden of Eden. Thus the so-called \"war\" is, in one of its many meanings,also an allegorical record of the strife between the two classes of adepts -- of the right and of the left path. There werethree classes of Rishis in India, who were"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Nagas are described by the Orientalists as a mysterious people whose landmarks are found abundantly in India tothis day, and who lived in Naga dwipa one of the Seven continents or divisions of Bharatavarsha (old India), the town ofNagpur being one of the most ancient cities in the country.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 502 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the earliest adepts known; the royal, or Rajarshis, kings and princes, who adopted the ascetic life; the Devarshis, divine,or the sons of Dharma or Yoga; and Brahmarshis, descendants of those Rishis who were the founders of gotras ofBrahmans, or caste-races. Now, leaving the mythical and astronomical keys for one moment aside, the secret teachingsshow many Atlanteans who belonged to these divisions; and there were strifes and wars between them, de facto and dejure. Narada, one of the greatest Rishis, was a Devarishi; and he is shown in constant and everlasting feud with Brahma,Daksha, and other gods and sages. Therefore we may safely maintain that whatever the astronomical meaning of thisuniversally accepted legend, its human phase is based on real and historical events, disfigured into a theological dogmaonly to suit ecclesiastical purposes. As above so below. Sidereal phenomena, and the behaviour of the celestial bodies inthe heavens, were taken as a model, and the plan was carried out below, on earth. Thus, space, in its abstract sense,was called \"the realm of divine knowledge,\" and by the Chaldees or Initiates Ab Soo, the habitat (or Father, i.e., thesource) of knowledge, because it is in space that dwell the intelligent Powers which invisibly rule the Universe.*In the same manner and on the plan of the Zodiac in the upper Ocean or the heavens, a certain realm on Earth, an inlandsea, was consecrated and called \"the Abyss of Learning\"; twelve centres on it in the shape of twelve small islandsrepresenting the Zodiacal signs -- two of which remained for ages the \"mystery signs\"** and were the abodes of twelveHierophants and masters of wisdom. This \"sea of knowledge\" or learning*** remained for ages there, where nowstretches the Shamo, or Gobi desert. It existed until the last great glacial period, when a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Not less suggestive are the qualities attributed to Rudra Siva, the great Yogi, the forefather of all the Adepts -- inEsotericism one of the greatest Kings of the Divine Dynasties. Called \"the Earliest\" and the \"Last,\" he is the patron of theThird, Fourth, and the Fifth Root-Races. For, in his earliest character, he is the ascetic Dig-ambara, \"clothed with theElements,\" Trilochana, \"the three-eyed\"; Pancha-anana, \"the five-faced,\" an allusion to the past four and the present fifthrace, for, though five-faced, he is only \"four-armed,\" as the fifth race is still alive. He is the \"God of Time,\" Saturn-Kronos,as his damaru (drum), in the shape of an hour-glass, shows; and if he is accused of having cut off Brahma's fifth head,and left him with only four, it is again an allusion to a certain degree in initiation, and also to the Races.** G. Seiffarth's idea that the signs of the Zodiac were in ancient times only ten is erroneous. Ten only were known to theprofane; the initiates, however, knew them all, from the time of the separation of mankind into sexes, whence arose theseparation of Virgo-Scorpio into two; which, owing to a secret sign added and the Libra invented by the Greeks, instead ofthe secret name which was not given, made 12. (Vide Isis Unveiled, Vol. II., p. 456.)*** The above is, perhaps, a key to the Dalai-Lama's symbolical name -- the \"Ocean\" lama, meaning the Wisdom Ocean.Abbe Huc speaks of it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 503 THE MYTH OF BEL AND MERODACH.local cataclysm, which swept the waters south and west and so formed the present great desolate desert, left only acertain oasis, with a lake and one island in the midst of it, as a relic of the Zodiacal Ring on Earth. For ages the wateryabyss -- which, with the nations that preceded the later Babylonians, was the abode of the \"great mother\" (the terrestrialpost-type of the \"great mother chaos\" in heaven), the parent of Ea (Wisdom), himself the early prototype of Oannes, theman-Fish of the Babylonians -- for ages, then, the \"Abyss\" or Chaos was the abode of wisdom and not of evil. Thestruggle of Bel and then of Merodach, the Sun-god, with Tiamat, the Sea and its Dragon, a \"war\" which ended in thedefeat of the latter, has a purely cosmic and geological meaning, as well as an historical one. It is a page torn out of theHistory of the Secret and Sacred Sciences, their evolution, growth and DEATH -- for the profane masses. It relates (a) tothe systematic and gradual drying up of immense territories by the fierce Sun at a certain pre-historic period; one of theterrible droughts which ended by a gradual transformation of once fertile lands abundantly watered into the sandy desertswhich they are now; and (b) to the as systematic persecution of the Prophets of the Right Path by those of the Left. Thelatter, having inaugurated the birth and evolution of the sacerdotal castes, have finally led the world into all these exotericreligions, invented to satisfy the depraved tastes of the \"hoi polloi\" and the ignorant for ritualistic pomp and thematerialization of the ever-immaterial and Unknowable Principle.This was a certain improvement on the Atlantean sorcery, the memory of which lingers in the remembrances of all theliterary and Sanskrit-speaking portion of India, as well as in the popular legends. Still it was a parody on, and thedesecration of the Sacred Mysteries and their science. The rapid progress of anthropomorphism and idolatry led the earlyFifth, as it had already led the Fourth Race, into sorcery once more, though on a smaller scale. Finally, even the four\"Adams\" (symbolizing under other names the four preceding races) were forgotten; and passing from one generation intoanother, each loaded with some additional myths, got at last drowned in that ocean of popular symbolism called thePantheons. Yet they exist to this day in the oldest Jewish traditions, as the Tzelem, \"the Shadow-Adam\" (the Chhayas ofour doctrine); the \"model\" Adam, the copy of the first, and the \"male and female\" of the exoteric genesis (chap. i.); thethird, the \"earthly Adam\" before the Fall, an androgyne; and the Fourth -- the Adam after his fall, i.e., separated intosexes, or the pure Atlantean. The Adam of the garden of Eden, or the forefather of our race -- the fifth -- is an ingeniouscompound of the above four. As stated in Zohar (iii., fol. 4, col. 14, Cremona Ed.) Adam, the FIRST man, is not found------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 504 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"now on earth, he \"is not found in all, below.\" Because, \"where does the lower earth come from? From the chain of theEarth, and heaven above,\" i.e., from the superior globes, those which precede and are above our Earth. \"And there cameout from it (the chain) creatures of all kinds. Some of them in (solid) skins, some in shells (Klippoth) . . . some in redshells, some in black, some in white, and some of other colours . . . \" (See Qabbalah).As in the Chaldean Cosmogony of Berosus and the Stanzas just given, some treatises on the Kabala speak of creatureswith two faces, some with four, and some with one face: for \"the highest Adam did not come down in all the countries, orproduce progeny and have many wives,\" but is a Mystery.So is the Dragon a mystery. Truly, says Rabbi Simeon Ben-Iochai, that to understand the meaning of the Dragon is notgiven to the \"Companions\" (students, or chelas), but only to \"the little ones,\" i.e., the perfect Initiates.* \"The work of thebeginning the companions understand; but it is only the little ones who understand the parable on the work in thePrincipium by the mystery of the serpent of the Great Sea.\"** And those Christians, who may happen to read this, willalso understand by the light of the above sentence who their \"Christ\" was. For Jesus states repeatedly that he who \"shallnot receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein\"; and if some of his sayings have been meant toapply to children without any metaphor, most of what relates to the \"little ones\" in the Gospels, related to the Initiates, ofwhom Jesus was one. Paul (Saul) is referred to in the Talmud as \"the little one.\"That \"Mystery of the Serpent\" was this: Our Earth, or rather terrestrial life, is often referred to in the Secret Teachings asthe great Sea, \"the sea of life\" having remained to this day a favourite metaphor. The Siphrah Dzeniouta speaks ofprimeval chaos and the evolution of the Universe after a destruction (pralaya), comparing it to an uncoiling serpent:--\"Extending hither and thither, its tail in its mouth, the head twisting on its neck, it is enraged and angry. . . It watches andconceals itself. Every thousand Days it is manifested.\" (I., § 16).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Such was the name given in ancient Judea to the Initiates, called also the \"Innocents\" and the \"Infants,\" i.e., once morereborn. This key opens a vista into one of the New Testament mysteries; the slaughter by Herod of the 40,000\"Innocents.\" There is a legend to this effect, and the event which took place almost a century B.C., shows the origin of thetradition blended at the same time with that of Krishna and his uncle Kansa. In the case of the N. T., Herod stands forAlexander Janneus (of Lyda), whose persecution and murder of hundreds and thousands of Initiates led to the adoptionof the Bible story.** Zohar ii., 34.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 505 THE SACREDNESS OF THE SERPENT.A commentary on the Puranas says: \"Ananta-Sesha is a form of Vishnu, the Holy Spirit of Preservation, and a symbol ofthe Universe, on which it is supposed to sleep during the intervals of the Days of Brahma. The seven heads of Seshasupport the Universe. . . . \"So the Spirit of God \"sleeps,\" is \"breathing\" (meracha' pheth') over the Chaos of undifferentiated matter, before each new\"Creation.\" (Siphrah Dzeniouta). Now one \"Day\" of Brahma is composed, as already explained, of one thousandMahayugas; and as each \"Night\" or period of rest is equal in duration to this \"day,\" it is easy to see to what this sentencein Siphrah Dzeniouta refers, viz.:-- that the serpent manifests \"once in a thousand days.\" Nor is it more difficult to seewhither the initiated writer of the Siphrah is leading us, when he says: \"Its head is broken in the waters of the great sea,as it is written: 'Thou dividest the sea by thy strength, thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters' \" (lxxiv. 13). Itrefers to the trials of the Initiates in this physical life, the \"sea of sorrow,\" if read with one key; it hints at the successivedestruction of the seven spheres of a chain of worlds in the great sea of space, when read with another key: for everysidereal globe or sphere, every world, star, or group of stars, is called in symbolism \"the Dragon's head.\" But however itmay read, the Dragon was never regarded as Evil, nor was the Serpent either -- in antiquity. In the metaphors, whetherastronomical, cosmical, theogonical or simply physiological, i.e., phallic -- the Serpent was always regarded as a divinesymbol. When it is said \"The (Cosmic) Serpent which runs with 370 leaps\" (Siphrah Dzeniouta, § 33) it means the cyclicperiods of the great Tropical year (25,868 years), divided in the esoteric calculation into 370 periods or cycles, as onesolar year is divided into 365 days. And if Michael was regarded by the Christians as the Conqueror of Satan, the Dragon,it is because in the Talmud this fighting personage is represented as the Prince of Waters, who had seven subordinateSpirits under him -- a good reason why the Latin Church made him the patron Saint of every promontory in Europe. In theKabala (Siph. Dzen.) the creative Force \"makes sketches and spiral lines of his creation in the shape of a Serpent.\" It\"holds its tail in its mouth,\" because it is the symbol of endless eternity and of cyclic periods. Its meanings, however,would require a volume, and we must end.Thus the reader may now see for himself what are the several meanings of the \"War in Heaven,\" and of the \"greatdragon.\" The most solemn and dreaded of church dogmas, the alpha and omega of Christian faith, and the pillar of itsFALL and ATONEMENT, dwindles down to a pagan symbol, in the many allegories about those prehistoric struggles.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 506 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.§ XIX.IS PLEROMA SATAN'S LAIR?THE subject is not yet exhausted, and has to be examined from still other aspects."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Whether Milton's grandiose description of the three Days' Battle of the Angels of Light against those of Darkness justifiesthe suspicion that he must have heard of the corresponding Eastern tradition -- it is impossible to say. Nevertheless, if nothimself in connection with some Mystic, then it must have been through some one who had obtained access to the secretworks of the Vatican. Among these there is a tradition of the \"Beni Shamash\" -- the \"children of the Sun\" -- concerning theEastern allegory, with far more minute details in its triple version, than one can get either from the Book of Enoch, or thefar more recent Revelation of St. John about the \"Old Dragon\" and his various Slayers, as just shown.It seems inexplicable to find, to this day, authors belonging to Mystical Societies who yet continue in their preconceiveddoubts as to the \"alleged\" antiquity of the \"Book of Enoch.\" Thus, while the author of the \"Sacred Mysteries among theMayas and Quiches\" is inclined to see in Enoch an Initiate converted to Christianity (! !) (vide p. 16), the English compilerof Eliphas Levi's works -- \"The Mysteries of Magic\" -- is also of a like opinion. He remarks that: \"Outside the erudition ofDr. Kenealy, no modern scholarship attributes any more remote antiquity to the latter work (the 'Book of Enoch') than thefourth century B.C.\" (Biograph. and Critical Essay, p. xxxviii.). Modern scholarship has been guilty of worse errors thanthis one. It seems but yesterday that the greatest literary critics in Europe denied the very authenticity of that work,together with the Orphic Hymns, and even the Book of Hermes or Thot, until whole verses from the latter were discoveredon Egyptian monuments and tombs of the earliest dynasties. The opinion of Archbishop Laurence is quoted elsewhere.The \"Old Dragon\" and Satan, now become singly and collectively the symbol of, and the theological term for, the \"FallenAngel,\" is not so described either in the original Kabala (the Chaldean \"Book of Numbers\") or in the modern. For the mostlearned, if not the greatest of modern Kabalists, namely Eliphas Levi, describes Satan in the following glowing terms:-- \"Itis that Angel who was proud enough to believe himself God; brave enough to buy his independence at the price of eternalsuffering and torture; beautiful enough to have adored------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 507 THE LIVING DEVILS.himself in full divine light; strong enough to reign in darkness amidst agony, and to have built himself a throne on hisinextinguishable pyre. It is the Satan of the Republican and heretical Milton. . . . . the prince of anarchy, served by ahierarchy of pure Spirits (! ! ) . . . . \"(Histoire de la Magie, 16-17) This description -- one which reconciles so cunninglytheological dogma and the Kabalistic allegory, and even contrives to include a political compliment in its phraseology -- is,when read in the right spirit, quite correct.Yes, indeed; it is this grandest of ideals, this ever-living symbol -- nay apotheosis -- of self-sacrifice for the intellectualindependence of humanity; this ever active Energy protesting against Static Inertia -- the principle to which Self-assertionis a crime, and Thought and the Light of Knowledge odious. It is -- as Eliphas says with unparalleled justice and irony --\"this pretended hero of tenebrous eternities, who, slanderously charged with ugliness, is decorated with horns and claws,which would fit far better his implacable tormentor -- it is he who has been finally transformed into a serpent -- the redDragon.\" But Eliphas Levi was yet too subservient to his Roman Catholic authorities; one may add, too jesuitical, toconfess that this devil was mankind, and never had any existence on earth outside of that mankind.*In this, Christian theology, although following slavishly in the steps of Paganism, was only true to its own time-honouredpolicy. It had to isolate itself, and to assert its authority. Hence it could not do better than turn every pagan deity into adevil. Every bright sun-god of antiquity -- a glorious deity by day, and its own opponent and adversary by night, namedthe Dragon of Wisdom, because it was supposed to contain the germs of night and day -- has now been turned into theantithetical shadow of God, and has become Satan on the sole and unsupported authority of despotic human dogma.After which all these producers of light and shadow, all the Sun and the Moon Gods, were cursed, and thus the one Godchosen out of the many, and Satan, were both anthropomorphised. But theology seems to have lost sight of the humancapacity for discriminating and finally analysing all that is artificially forced upon its reverence. History shows in every raceand even tribe, especially in the Semitic nations, the natural impulse to exalt its own tribal deity above all others to thehegemony[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* What devil could be possessed of more cunning, craft and cruelty than the \"Whitechapel murderer\" \"Jack the Ripper\" of1888, whose unparalleled blood-thirsty and cool wickedness led him to slaughter and mutilate in cold blood sevenunfortunate and otherwise innocent women!

Whether originally a conscious or an unconscious blunder, nevertheless, it was one. Jehovahhas ever been in antiquity only \"a god among other Gods,\" (lxxxii. Psalm). The Lord appears to Abraham, and whilesaying, \"I am the Almighty God,\" yet adds, \"I will establish my covenant to be a God unto thee\" (Abraham), and unto hisseed after him (Gen. xvii. 7) -- not unto Aryan Europeans.But then, there was the grandiose and ideal figure of Jesus of Nazareth to be set off against a dark background, to gain inradiance by the contrast; and a darker one the Church could hardly invent. Lacking the Old Testament symbology,ignorant of the real connotation of the name of Jehovah -- the rabbinical secret substitute for the ineffable andunpronounceable name -- the Church mistook the cunningly fabricated shadow for the reality, the anthropomorphizedgenerative symbol for the one Secondless Reality, the ever unknowable cause of all. As a logical sequence the Church,for purposes of duality, had to invent an anthropomorphic Devil -- created, as taught by her, by God himself. Satan hasnow turned out to be the monster fabricated by the \"Jehovah-Frankenstein,\" -- his father's curse and a thorn in the divineside -- a monster, than whom no earthly Frankenstein could have fabricated a more ridiculous bogey."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"The author of \"New Aspects of Life\" describes the Jewish God very correctly from the Kabalistic stand-point as \"the Spiritof the Earth, which had revealed itself to the Jew as Jehovah\" (p. 209). \"It was that Spirit again who, after the death ofJesus, assumed his form and personated him as the risen Christ\" -- the doctrine of Cerinthius and several Gnostic sectswith slight variation, as one can see. But the author's explanations and deductions are remarkable: \"None knew . . . betterthan Moses . . . and so well as he how great was the power of those (gods of Egypt) with whose priests he hadcontended,\" he says . . . \"the gods of which Jehovah is claimed to be the God\" (by the Jews only). \"What were thesegods, these Achar of which Jehovah, the Achad, is claimed to be the God . . . by overcoming them?\" the author asks; towhich our Occultism answers: \"those whom the Church now calls the Fallen Angels and collectively Satan, the Dragon,overcome, if we have to accept her dictum, by Michael and the Host, that Michael being simply Jehovah himself, one ofthe subordinate Spirits at best.\" Therefore, the author is again right in saying: \"The Greeks believed in the existence of . .. daimons. But . . . they were anticipated by the Hebrews, who held that------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 509 JEHOVAH, A PERSONATING SPIRIT.there was a class of personating spirits which they designated demons, 'personators.' Admitting with Jehovah, whoexpressly asserts it, the existence of other gods, which were personators of the One God, were these other gods simply ahigher class of personating spirits, which had acquired and exercised greater powers? And is not personation the Key tothe mystery of the Spirit state? But once granting this position, how are we to know that Jehovah was not a personatingSpirit, a Spirit which arrogated to itself that it was, and thus became, the personator of the one unknown and unknowableGod? Nay, how do we know that the Spirit calling itself Jehovah, in arrogating to itself his attributes did not thus cause itsown designation to be imputed to the One who is in reality as nameless as incognizable?\" (pp. 144-145.)Then the author shows \"that the Spirit Jehovah is a personator\" on its own admission. It acknowledged to Moses \"that ithad appeared to the patriarchs as the God Shaddai\" . . . . and \"the god Helion\" . . . . With the same breath it assumed thename of Jehovah; and it is on the faith of the assertion of this personator that the names El, Eloah, Elohim, and Shaddai,have been read and interpreted in juxtaposition with Jehovah as \"the Lord God Almighty.\" Then when the name Jehovahbecame ineffable . . . . the designation Adonai, \"Lord\" was substituted for it, and\" . . . . it was owing to this substitution thatthe 'Lord' passed from the Jewish to the Christian 'Word' and 'World' as a designation of God\" (p. 146). And how are weto know, the author may add, that Jehovah was not many spirits personating even that seemingly one -- Jod or Jod-He?But if the Christian Church was the first to make the existence of Satan a dogma, it was because, as shown in Isis, theDevil -- the powerful enemy of God (? ! !) had to become the corner stone of the pillar of the Church. For, as aTheosophist, M. Jules Baissac, truly observes in his \"Satan ou le Diable\" (p. 9): \"Il fallait eviter de paraitre autoriser ledogme du double principe en faisant de ce Satan createur une puissance reelle, et pour expliquer le mal originel, onprofere contre Manes l'hypothese d'une permission de l'unique tout Puissant.\"* The choice and policy were unfortunate,anyhow. Either the personator of the lower god of Abraham and Jacob ought to have been made entirely distinct from themystic \"Father\" of Jesus, or -- the \"Fallen\" Angels should have been left unslandered by further fictions.Every god of the Gentiles is connected with, and closely related to,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* After the polymorphic Pantheism of some Gnostics came the esoteric dualism of Manes, who was accused ofpersonifying Evil and creating of the Devil a God -- rival of God himself. We do not see that the Christian Church has somuch improved on that exoteric idea of the Manicheans, for she calls God her King of Light, and Satan, the King ofDarkness, to this day.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 510 THE SECRET DOCTRINEJehovah -- the Elohim; for they are all One Host, whose units differ only in name in the esoteric teachings. Between the\"Obedient\" and the \"Fallen\" Angels there is no difference whatever, except in their respective functions, or rather in theinertia of some, and the activity of others among those \"Dhyan Chohans\" or Elohim who were \"commissioned to create,\"i.e., to fabricate the manifested world out of the eternal material.The Kabbalists say that the true name of Satan is that of Jehovah placed upside down, for \"Satan is not a black god butthe negation of the white deity,\" or the light of Truth. God is light and Satan is the necessary darkness or shadow to set itoff, without which pure light would be invisible and incomprehensible.* \"For the initiates,\" says Eliphas Levi, \"the devil isnot a person but a creative Force, for Good as for Evil.\" They (the Initiates) represented this Force, which presides atphysical generation, under the mysterious form of God Pan -- or Nature: whence the horns and hoofs of that mythical andsymbolic figure, as also the Christian \"goat of the Witches' Sabbath.\" With regard to this too, Christians have imprudentlyforgotten that the goat was also the victim selected for the atonement of all the sins of Israel, that the scape-goat wasindeed the sacrificial martyr, the symbol of the greatest mystery on earth -- the Fall into generation. Only the Jews havelong forgotten the real meaning of their (to the non-initiated) ridiculous hero, selected from the drama of life in the greatmysteries enacted by them in the desert; and the Christians never knew it.Eliphas Levi seeks to explain the dogma of his Church by paradoxes and metaphors, but succeeds very poorly in the faceof the many volumes written by pious Roman Catholic demonologists under the approbation and auspices of Rome, inthis nineteenth century of ours. For the true Roman Catholic, the devil or Satan is a reality; the drama enacted in thesidereal light according to the seer of Patmos -- who desired, perhaps, to improve upon the narrative in the \"Book ofEnoch\" -- is as real, and as historical a fact as any other allegory and symbolical event in the Bible. But the Initiates givean explanation[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* To quote in this relation Mr. Laing in his admirable work \"Modern Science and Modern Thought\" (p. 222, 3rd Ed.): \"Fromthis dilemma (existence of evil in the world) there is no escape, unless we give up altogether the idea of an"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"anthropomorphic deity, and adopt frankly the Scientific idea of a First Cause, inscrutable and past finding out; and of auniverse whose laws we can trace, but of whose real essence we know nothing, and can only suspect, or faintly discern afundamental law which may make the polarity of good and evil a necessary condition of existence.\" Were Science toknow \"the real essence,\" instead of knowing nothing of it, the faint suspicion would turn into the certitude of the existenceof such a law, and the knowledge that this law is connected with Karma.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 511 AKASA, THE \"MYSTERIUM MAGNUM.\"which differs from that given by Eliphas Levi, whose genius and crafty intellect had to submit to a certain compromisedictated to him from Rome.Thus, the true and uncompromising Kabalists admit that, for all purposes of Science and philosophy, it is enough that theprofane should know that the great magic agent called by the followers of the Marquis de St. Martin -- the Martinists --astral light, by the mediaeval Kabalists and Alchemists the Sidereal Virgin and the Mysterium Magnum, and by theEastern Occultists AEther, the reflection of Akasa -- is that which the Church calls Lucifer. That the Latin scholastics havesucceeded in transforming the universal soul and Pleroma, the vehicle of Light and the receptacle of all the forms, a forcespread throughout the whole Universe, with its direct and indirect effects, into Satan and his works, is no news to anyone. But now they are prepared to give out to the above-mentioned profane even the secrets hinted at by Eliphas Leviwithout adequate explanation; for the latter's policy of veiled revelations could only lead to further superstition andmisunderstanding. What, indeed, can a student of Occultism, a beginner, gather from the following highly poeticalsentences of Eliphas Levi, as apocalyptic as the writings of any of the Alchemists?\"Lucifer, the Astral Light . . . . is an intermediate force existing in all creation, it serves to create and to destroy, and theFall of Adam was an erotic intoxication which has rendered his generation a slave to this fatal light . . . every sexualpassion that overpowers our senses is a whirlwind of that light which seeks to drag us towards the abyss of death, Folly.Hallucinations, visions, ecstasies are all forms of a very dangerous excitation due to this interior phosphorus (?). Thuslight, finally, is of the nature of fire, the intelligent use of which warms and vivifies, and the excess of which, on thecontrary, dissolves and annihilates. Thus man is called upon to assume a sovereign empire over that (astral) light andconquer thereby his immortality, and is threatened at the same time with being intoxicated, absorbed, and eternallydestroyed by it. This light, therefore, inasmuch as it is devouring, revengeful, and fatal, would thus really be hell-fire, theserpent of the legend; the tormented errors of which it is full, the tears and the gnashing of teeth of the abortive beings itdevours, the phantom of life that escapes them, and seems to mock and insult their agony, all this would be the devil orSatan indeed.\" (Histoire de la Magie, p. 197).There is no wrong statement in all this; nothing save a superabundance of ill-applied metaphors, as in the application ofAdam -- a myth -- to the illustration of the astral effects. Akasa -- the astral light* -- can be defined in a few words; it is theuniversal Soul, the Matrix of the Universe, the \"Mysterium Magnum\" from which all that exists is born by separation ordifferentiation. It is the cause of existence; it[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Akasa is not the Ether of Science, as some Orientalists translate it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 512 THE SECRET DOCTRINEfills all the infinite Space; is Space itself, in one sense, or both its Sixth and Seventh principles.* But as the finite in theInfinite, as regards manifestation, this light must have its shadowy side -- as already remarked. And as the infinite cannever be manifested, hence the finite world has to be satisfied with the shadow alone, which its actions draw uponhumanity and which men attract and force to activity. Hence, while it is the universal Cause in its unmanifested unity andinfinity, the Astral light becomes, with regard to Mankind, simply the effects of the causes produced by men in their sinfullives. It is not its bright denizens --- whether they are called Spirits of Light or Darkness -- that produce Good or Evil, butmankind itself that determines the unavoidable action and reaction in the great magic agent. It is mankind which hasbecome the \"Serpent of Genesis,\" and thus causes daily and hourly the Fall and sin of the \"Celestial Virgin\" -- which thusbecomes the Mother of gods and devils at one and the same time; for she is the ever-loving, beneficent deity to all thosewho stir her Soul and heart, instead of attracting to themselves her shadowy manifested essence, called by Eliphas Levi -- \"the fatal light\" which kills and destroys. Humanity, in its units, can overpower and master its effects; but only by theholiness of their lives and by producing good causes. It has power only on the manifested lower principles -- the shadowof the Unknown and Incognizable Deity in Space. But in antiquity and reality, Lucifer, or Luciferus, is the name of theangelic Entity presiding over the light of truth as over the light of the day. In the great Valentinian gospel Pistis Sophia (§361) it is taught that of the three Powers emanating from the Holy names of the Three [[Tridunameis]], that of Sophia (theHoly Ghost according to these gnostics -- the most cultured of all), resides in the planet Venus or Lucifer.Thus to the profane, the Astral Light may be God and Devil at once --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Says Johannes Tritheim, the Abbot of Spanheim, the greatest astrologer and Kabalist of his day:-- \"The art of divinemagic consists in the ability to perceive the essence of things in the light of nature (astral light), and by using the soul-powers of the spirit to produce material things from the unseen universe, and in such operations the Above and the Belowmust be brought together and made to act harmoniously. The spirit of Nature (astral light) is a unity, creating and formingeverything, and acting through the instrumentality of man it may produce wonderful things. Such are accomplished, if youlearn to know yourself. You will know it by the power of the spirit that is in yourself, and accomplish it by mixing your spiritwith the essence that comes out of yourself. If you wish to succeed in such a work you must know how to separate Spiritand Life in Nature, and, moreover, to separate the astral soul in yourself and to make it tangible, and then the substanceof the soul will appear visibly and tangibly rendered objective by the power of the spirit.\" -- (Quoted in Dr. Hartman's\"Paracelsus.\")"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 513 MIND, THE QUICKENING SPIRIT.Demon est Deus inversus: that is to say, through every point of Infinite Space thrill the magnetic and electrical currents ofanimate Nature, the life-giving and death-giving waves, for death on earth becomes life on another plane. Lucifer is divineand terrestrial light, the \"Holy Ghost\" and \"Satan,\" at one and the same time, visible Space being truly filled with thedifferentiated Breath invisibly; and the Astral Light, the manifested effects of the two who are one, guided and attracted byourselves, is the Karma of humanity, both a personal and impersonal entity: personal, because it is the mystic namegiven by St. Martin to the Host of divine Creators, guides and rulers of this planet; impersonal, as the Cause and effect ofuniversal Life and Death.The Fall was the result of man's knowledge, for his \"eyes were opened.\" Indeed, he was taught Wisdom and the hiddenknowledge by the \"Fallen Angel,\" for the latter had become from that day his Manas, Mind and Self-consciousness. Ineach of us that golden thread of continuous life -- periodically broken into active and passive cycles of sensuousexistence on Earth, and super-sensuous in Devachan -- is from the beginning of our appearance upon this earth. It is theSutratma, the luminous thread of immortal impersonal monadship, on which our earthly lives or evanescent Egos arestrung as so many beads -- according to the beautiful expression of Vedantic philosophy.And now it stands proven that Satan, or the Red Fiery Dragon, the \"Lord of Phosphorus\" (brimstone was a theologicalimprovement), and Lucifer, or \"Light-Bearer,\" is in us: it is our Mind -- our tempter and Redeemer, our intelligent liberatorand Saviour from pure animalism. Without this principle -- the emanation of the very essence of the pure divine principleMahat (Intelligence), which radiates direct from the Divine mind -- we would be surely no better than animals. The firstman Adam was made only a living soul (nephesh), the last Adam was made a quickening Spirit*:-- says Paul, his wordsreferring to the building or Creation of man. Without this quickening spirit, or human Mind or soul, there would be nodifference between man and beast; as there is none, in fact, between animals with respect to their actions. The tiger andthe donkey, the hawk and the dove, are each one as pure and as innocent as the other, because irresponsible. Eachfollows its instinct, the tiger and the hawk killing with the same unconcern as the donkey eats a thistle, or the dove pecksat a grain of corn.

The body \"is sown in weakness (passivity); it is raised in power\" (43) --or in spirituality and intellect.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 514 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.fall occurred as a result of an act never intended by nature, -- a sin, how about the animals? If we are told that theyprocreate their species in consequence of that same \"original sin,\" for which God cursed the earth -- hence everythingliving on it -- we will put another question. We are told by theology, as by Science, that the animal was on earth far earlierthan man? We ask the former: How did it procreate its species, before the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, of the Good andthe Evil, had been plucked off? As said: \"The Christians -- far less clear-sighted than the great Mystic and Liberatorwhose name they have assumed, whose doctrines they have misunderstood and travestied, and whose memory theyhave blackened by their deeds -- took the Jewish Jehovah as he was, and of course strove vainly to reconcile the Gospelof Light and Liberty with the Deity of Darkness and Submission.\" (\"War in Heaven.\")*But, it is sufficiently proven now that all the soi-disant evil Spirits who are credited with having made war on the gods, areidentical as personalities; moreover, that all the ancient religions taught the same tenet save the final conclusion, whichlatter differs from the Christian. The seven primeval gods had all a dual state, one essential, the other accidental. In theiressential state they were all the \"Builders\" or Fashioners, the Preservers and the rulers of this world, and in the accidentalstate, clothing themselves in visible corporeality, they descended on the earth and reigned on it as Kings and Instructorsof the lower Hosts, who had incarnated once more upon it as men.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* By Godolphin Mitford, later in life, Murad Ali Bey. Born in India, the son of a Missionary, G. Mitford was converted toIslam, and died a Mahomedan in 1884. He was a most extraordinary Mystic, of a great learning and remarkableintelligence. But he left the Right Path and forthwith fell under Karmic retribution. As well shown by the author of thearticle quoted \"The followers of the defeated Elohim, first massacred by the victorious Jews (the Jehovites), and thenpersuaded by the victorious Christians and Mohamedans, continued nevertheless. . . Some of these scattered sects havelost even the tradition of the true rationale of their belief -- to worship in secrecy and mystery the Principle of Fire, Light,and Liberty. Why do the Sabean Bedouins (avowedly Monotheists when dwelling in the Mohamedan cities) in the solitudeof the desert night yet invoke the starry 'Host of Heaven'? Why do the Yezidis, the 'Devil Worshippers,' worship the'Muluk-Taoos' -- The 'Lord Peacock' -- the emblem of pride and of hundred-eyed intelligence (and of Initiation also), whichwas expelled from heaven with Satan, according to an old Oriental tradition? Why do the Gholaites and their kindredMesopotamo-Iranian Mohamedan Sects believe in the 'Noor Illahee' -- the Light of the Elohim -- transmitted in anastasisthrough a hundred Prophet Leaders? It is because they have continued in ignorant superstition the traditional religion ofthe 'Light Deities whom Jahveh overthrew' (is said to have overthrown rather); for by overthrowing them he would haveoverthrown himself.

Teaching the dogma of the Fallen Angels in its dead-letter meaning, and havingmade of Satan the corner-stone and pillar of the dogma of redemption -- to do so would be suicidal. Having once shownthe rebellious angels distinct from God and the Logos in their personalities, the admission that the downfall of thedisobedient Spirits meant simply their fall into generation and matter, would be equivalent to saying that God and Satanwere identical. For since the LOGOS (or God) is the aggregate of that once divine Host accused of having fallen, it wouldfollow that the Logos and Satan are one.Yet such was the real philosophical view of the now disfigured tenet in antiquity. The Verbum, or the \"Son,\" was shown ina dual aspect by the Pagan Gnostics -- in fact, he was a duality in full unity. Hence, the endless and various nationalversions. The Greeks had Jupiter, the son of Chronos, the Father, who hurls him down into the depths of Kosmos. TheAryans had Brahma (in later theology) precipitated by Siva into the Abyss of Darkness, etc., etc. But the fall of all theseLogoi and Demiurgi from their primitive exalted position, had in all cases one and the same esoteric signification in it; thecurse -- in its philosophical meaning -- of being incarnated on this earth; an unavoidable rung on the ladder of cosmicevolution, a highly philosophical and fitting Karmic law, without which the presence of Evil on Earth would have to remainfor ever a closed mystery to the understanding of true philosophy. To say, as the author of the Esprits Tombes desPaiens (p. 347) does, that since \"Christianity is made to rest on two pillars, that of evil ([[ponerou]]), and of good[[Iagathou]]; on two forces, in short, [[Iagathau kai kakai dunomeis]]: hence, if we suppress the punishment of the evilforces, the protecting mission of the good Powers will have neither value nor sense\" -- is to utter the most unphilosophicalabsurdity. If it fits in with, and explains Christian dogma, it obscures the facts and truths of the primitive wisdom of theages. The cautious hints of Paul have all the true esoteric meaning, and it took centuries of scholastic casuistry to givethem the present false colouring in their interpretation. The verbum and Lucifer are one in their dual aspect; and the\"Prince of the Air\" (princeps aeris hujus) is not the \"God of that period,\" but an everlasting principle. If the latter was saidto be ever circling around the world -- qui circumambulat terram -- the great Apostle referred simply to the never-ceasingcycles of human incarnations, in which evil will ever predominate unto the day when Humanity is redeemed by the truedivine Enlightenment which gives the correct perception of things.It is easy to disfigure vague expressions written in dead and long-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 516 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.forgotten languages, and palm them off as truths and revealed facts on the ignorant masses. The identity of thought andmeaning is the one thing that strikes the student in all the religions which mention the tradition of the fallen Spirits, and inthose great religions there is not one that fails to mention and describe it in one or another form. Thus, Hoang-Ty, thegreat Spirit, sees his Sons, who had acquired active wisdom, falling into the valley of Pain. Their leader, the FLYINGDRAGON, having drunk of the forbidden ambrosia, fell to the Earth with his Host (Kings). In the Zend Avesta, AngraMainyu (Ahriman), surrounding himself with fire (the \"Flames\" -- vide supra) seeks to conquer the Heavens,* when AhuraMazda, descending from the solid Heaven he inhabits, to the help of the Heavens that revolve (in time and space, themanifested worlds of cycles including those of incarnation), and the Amshaspends, \"the seven bright Sravah,\"accompanied by their stars, fight Ahriman, and the vanquished Devas fall to the Earth along with him. (Acad. des Inscrip.,Vol. xxxix., p. 690; see Vendidad, Farg. xix., iii.) In the Vendidad the Daevas are called \"evil-doing,\" and shown to rushaway \"into the depths of the world of hell,\" or matter. (47.) This is an allegory showing the Devas compelled to incarnate,once that they have separated themselves from their parent essence, or, in other words, after the unit had become amultiple, after differentiation and manifestation.Typhon the Egyptian, Python, the Titans, the Suras and the Asuras, all belong to the same legend of Spirits peopling theEarth. They are not \"demons commissioned to create and organize this visible universe,\" but fashioners (the \"architects\")of the worlds, and the progenitors of man. They are the Fallen angels, metaphorically -- \"the true mirrors of the EternalWisdom.\"What is the absolute and complete truth as well as the esoteric meaning about this universal myth? The whole essence oftruth cannot be transmitted from mouth to ear. Nor can any pen describe it, not even that of the recording Angel, unlessman finds the answer in the sanctuary of his own heart, in the innermost depths of his divine intuitions. It is the greatSEVENTH MYSTERY of Creation, the first and the last; and those who read St. John's Apocalypse may find its shadowlurking under the seventh seal. . . .

The dualism in the Mazdean religion, was born from exoteric interpretation. Theholy \"Airyaman,\" \"the bestower of weal,\" invoked in the prayer called Airyama-ishyo, is the divine aspect of Ahriman, \"thedeadly, the Dae of the Daevas\" (Farg. xx., 43), and Angra Mainyu is the dark material aspect of the former. \"Keep us fromthe Hater, O Mazda and Armaita Spenta\" (Vendidad Sadah), has, as a prayer and invocation, an identical meaning with\"Lead us not into temptation,\" and is addressed by man to the terrible Spirit of duality in man himself. For (Ahura) Mazda"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"is the spiritual, divine, and purified man, and Armaita Spenta, the Spirit of the Earth or materiality, is the same as Ahrimanor Angra Mainyu in one sense.The whole of the Magian or Mazdean literature -- or what remains of it -- is magical, occult, hence allegorical andsymbolical -- even its \"mystery of the law\" (see the Gatha in Yasna XLIV.). Now the Mobed and the Parsi keep their eyeon the Baresma during the sacrifice, the divine twig off Ormazd's \"tree\" having been transformed into a bunch of metallicrods; and wonder why neither the Amesha-Spentas, nor \"the high and beautiful golden Haomas, nor even their Vohu-Mano (good thoughts), nor their Rata (sacrificial offering),\" help them much. Let them meditate on the \"tree of Wisdom,\"and study, assimilating one by one, the fruits thereof. The way to the tree of eternal life, the white Homa, the Gaokerena,is through one end of the earth to the other; and Haoma is in heaven as it is on earth. But to become once more a priestof it, and a healer, man must heal himself before he can heal others.This proves once more that the so-called \"myths,\" in order to be at least approximately dealt with in any degree of justice,have to be closely examined from all their aspects. In truth, every one of the seven Keys has to be used in its right place,and never mixed with the others, if we would unveil the entire cycle of mysteries. In our day of dreary soul-killingmaterialism, the ancient priest Initiates have become, in the opinion of our learned generations, the synonyms of cleverimpostors, kindling the fires of superstition in order to obtain an easier sway over the minds of men. This is an unfoundedcalumny, generated by scepticism and uncharitable thoughts.

If, initiated into the Mysteriesof Nature, they were forced to withhold their knowledge from the profane, who would have surely abused it, such secrecywas undeniably less dangerous than the policy of their usurpers and successors. The former taught only that which theywell knew. The latter, teaching what they do not know, have invented, as a secure haven for their ignorance, a jealousand cruel Deity, who forbids man to pry into his mysteries under the penalty of damnation. As well they may, for hismysteries can at best be only hinted at in polite ears, never described. Turn to King's Gnostics, \"Description of the Plates\"(Plate H), and see for yourself what was the primitive Ark of the Covenant, according to the author, who says: \"There is aRabbinical tradition that the cherubin placed over it were represented as male and female, in the act of copulation, inorder to express the grand doctrine of the Essence of Form and Matter, the two principles of all things. When theChaldeans broke into the sanctuary and beheld this most astounding emblem, they naturally enough exclaimed, 'Is thisyour God, of whom you boast that He is such a lover of purity?' \" (p. 441.)King thinks that this tradition \"savours too much of Alexandrian philosophy to demand any credit,\" to which we demur.The shape and form of the wings of the two cherubim standing on the right and left sides of the Ark, these wings meetingover the \"Holy of Holies,\" are an emblem quite eloquent in itself, besides the \"holy\" Jod within the ark! The Mystery ofAgathadaemon, whose legend states, \"I am Chnumis, Sun of the Universe, 700,\" can alone solve the mystery of Jesus,the number of whose name is 888.\" It is not the key of St. Peter, or the Church dogma, but the narthex -- the wand of thecandidate for initiation -- that has to be wrenched from the grasp of the long-silent Sphinx of the ages.

In the same way that we saw Hephaestus moulding the first woman(Pandora) and endowing her with life, so Prometheus kneads the moist clay, of which he fashions the body of the firstman whom he will endow with the soul-spark\" (Apollodorus, I., 7, 1). After the Flood of Deukalion, Zeus, it was taught,had commanded Prometheus and Athena to call forth a new race of men from the mire left by the waters of the deluge(Ovid, Metam. 1, 81. Etym. M. v. [[Prometheus]]); and in the day of Pausanias the slime which the hero had used for thispurpose was still shown in Phocea (Paus. x, 4, 4). \"On several archaic monuments one still sees Prometheus modelling ahuman body, either alone or with Athena's help\" (Myth. Grece Ant. 246).The same authors remind the world of another equally mysterious personage, though one less generally known thanPrometheus, whose legend offers remarkable analogies with that of the Titan. The name of this second ancestor andgenerator is Phoroneus, the hero of an ancient poem, now unfortunately no longer extant -- the Phoronidae. His legendwas localized in Argolis, where a perpetual flame was preserved on his altar as a reminder that he was the bringer of fireupon earth (Pausanias, 11, 19, 5; Cf. 20, 3.) A benefactor of men as Prometheus was, he had made them participators ofevery bliss on earth. Plato (Timaeus, p. 22), and Clemens Alexandrinus (Strom. 1, p. 380) say that Phoroneus was thefirst man, or \"the father of mortals.\" His genealogy, which assigns to him as his father Inachos, the river, reminds one ofthat of Prometheus, which makes that Titan the son of the Oceanid Clymene. But the mother of Phoroneus was thenymph Melia; a significant descent which distinguishes him from Prometheus."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Melia, Decharme thinks, is the personification of the ash-tree, whence,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 520 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.according to Hesiod, issued the race of the age of Bronze* (Opera et Dies, 142-145); and which with the Greeks is thecelestial tree common to every Aryan mythology. This ash is the Yggdrasil of the Norse antiquity, which the Nornssprinkle daily with the waters from the fountain of Urd, that it may not wither. It remains verdant till the last days of theGolden Age. Then the Norns -- the three sisters who gaze respectively into the Past, the Present, and the Future -- makeknown the decree of Fate (Karma, Orlog), but men are conscious only of the Present. But when Gultweig comes (thegolden ore) \"the bewitching enchantress who, thrice cast into the fire, arises each time more beautiful, and fills the soulsof gods and men with unapproachable longing, then the Norns . . . enter into being, and the blessed peace of childhood'sdreams passes away, and Sin comes into existence with all its evil consequences . . .\" and KARMA (See \"Asgard and theGods,\" p. 10-12). The thrice purified Gold is -- Manas, the Conscious Soul.With the Greeks, the \"ash-tree\" represented the same idea. Its luxuriant boughs are the sidereal heaven, golden by dayand studded with stars by night -- the fruits of Melia and Yggdrasil, under whose protecting shadow humanity lived duringthe Golden Age without desire as without any fear . . . . \"That tree had a fruit, or an inflamed bough, which was lightning,\"Decharme guesses.And here steps in the killing materialism of the age; that peculiar twist in the modern mind, which, like a Northern blast,bends all on its way, and freezes every intuition, allowing it no hand in the physical speculations of the day. After havingseen in Prometheus no better than fire by friction, the learned author of the \"Mythologie de la Grece Antique\" perceives inthis \"fruit\" a trifle more than an allusion to terrestrial fire and its discovery. It is no longer fire, owing to the fall of lightningsetting some dry fuel in a blaze, and thus revealing all its priceless benefits to Palaeolithic men; -- but something moremysterious this time, though still as earthly. . . . \"A divine bird, nestled in the boughs of the celestial ash-tree, stole thatbough (or the fruit) and carried it down on the earth in its bill. Now the Greek word [[Phoroneus]] is the rigid equivalent ofthe Sanskrit word bhuranyu ('the rapid') an epithet of Agni, considered as the carrier of the divine spark. Phoroneus, sonof Melia or of the celestial ash, thus corresponds to a conception far more ancient, probably, than that one whichtransformed the pramantha (of the old Aryan Hindus) into the Greek Prometheus. Phoroneus is the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* According to the Occult teaching, three yugas passed away during the time of the Third Root-Race, i.e., the Satya, theTreta, and the Dvapara yuga, answering to the golden age of its early innocence: to the silver -- when it reached itsmaturity: and to the Bronze age, when, separating into sexes, they became the mighty demi-gods of old.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 521 THE POETRY OF MODERN ORIENTALISTS.(personified) bird, that brings the heavenly lightning to the Earth. Traditions relating to the birth and origin of the race ofBronze, and those which made of Phoroneus the father of the Argians, are an evidence to us that this thunderbolt (orlightning), as in the legends of Hephaestus or Prometheus, was the origin of the human race\" (266).This still affords us no more than the external meaning of the symbols and the allegory. It is now supposed that the nameof Prometheus has been unriddled, and the modern mythologists and Orientalists see in it no longer what their fatherssaw on the authority of the whole of classical antiquity. They only find therein something far more appropriate to the spiritof the age, namely, a phallic element. But the name of Phoroneus, as well as that of Prometheus, bears not one, noreven two, but a series of esoteric meanings. Both relate to the seven celestial fires; to Agni Abhimanin, his three sons,and their forty-five sons, constituting the forty-nine fires. Do all these numbers relate only to the terrestrial mode of fireand to the flame of sexual passion? Did the Hindu Aryan mind never soar above such purely sensual conceptions? thatmind which is declared by Prof. Max Muller to be the most spiritual and mystically inclined on the whole globe? Thenumber of those fires alone ought to have suggested an inkling of the truth.We are told that one is no longer permitted, in this age of rational thought, to explain the name of Prometheus as the oldGreeks did. The latter, it seems, \"basing themselves on the false analogy of [[prometheus]] with the verb[[Promanthanein]], saw in him the type of the 'foreseeing' man, to whom, for the sake of symmetry, a brother was added --Epimetheus, or 'he who takes counsel after the event.' \" But now the Orientalists have decided otherwise. They know thereal meaning of the two names better than those who invented them.The legend is based upon an event of universal importance. It was built \"to commemorate a great event which must havestrongly impressed itself upon the imagination of the first witnesses to it, and its remembrance has never since faded outfrom popular memory.\" What is it? Laying aside every poetical fiction, all those dreams of the golden age, let us imagine -- argue the modern scholars -- in all its gross realism, the first miserable state of humanity, the striking picture of whichwas traced for us after AEschylus by Lucretius, and the exact truth of which is now confirmed by science; and then onemay understand better that a new life really began for man, on that day when he saw the first spark produced by thefriction of two pieces of wood, or from the veins of a flint. How could man help feeling gratitude to that mysterious andmarvellous being which they were henceforth enabled to create at their will, and which was no sooner born, than it grewand expanded, developing with singular power. \"This terrestrial flame,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 522 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.was it not analogous in nature to that one which they received from above, or that other which frightened them in thethunderbolt?\"\"Was it not derived from the same source?

Such are the"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"questions which the curiosity of the Aryans offered in the early days of their existence, and which found their answer inthe myth of Prometheus\"; (Mythologie de la Grece Antique, p. 258).The philosophy of Occult Science finds two weak points in the above reflections, and points them out. The miserablestate of Humanity described by AEschylus and Prometheus was no more wretched then, in the early days of the Aryans,than it is now. That \"state\" was limited to the savage tribes; and the now-existing savages are not a whit more happy orunhappy than their forefathers were a million years ago.It is an accepted fact in Science that \"rude implements, exactly resembling those in use among existing savages,\" arefound in river-gravels and caves geologically \"implying an enormous antiquity.\" So great is that resemblance that, as theauthor of \"The Modern Zoroastrian\" tells us: \"If the collection in the Colonial Exhibition of stone celts and arrow-headsused now by the Bushmen of South Africa were placed side by side with one from the British Museum of similar objectsfrom Kent's Cavern or the Caves of Dordogne, no one but an expert could distinguish between them\" (p. 145). And ifthere are Bushmen existing now, in our age of the highest civilization, who are no higher intellectually than the race ofmen which inhabited Devonshire and Southern France during the Palaeolithic age, why could not the latter have livedsimultaneously with, and have been the contemporary of, other races as highly civilized for their day as we are for ours?That the sum of knowledge increases daily in mankind, \"but that intellectual capacity does not increase with it,\" is shownwhen the intellect, if not the physical knowledge, of the Euclids, Pythagorases, Paninis, Kapilas, Platos, and Socrates, iscompared with that of the Newtons, Kants, and the modern Huxleys and Haeckels. On comparing the results obtained byDr. J. Barnard Davis, the Craniologist, worked out in 1868 (Trans. of the Royal Society of London), with regard to theinternal capacity of the skull -- its volume being taken as the standard and test for judging of the intellectual capacities --Dr. Pfaff finds that this capacity among the French (certainly in the highest rank of mankind) is 88.4 cubic inches, beingthus \"perceptibly smaller than that of the Polynesians generally, which, even among many Papuans and Alfuras of thelowest grade, amounts to 89 and 89.7 cubic inches\"; which shows that it is the quality and not the quantity of the brainthat is the cause of intellectual capacity. The------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 523 THE BOON GIVEN BY PROMETHEUS.average index of skulls among various races having been now recognized to be \"one of the most characteristic marks ofdifference between different races,\" the following comparison is suggestive: \"The index of breadth among theScandinavians (is) at 75: among the English at 76; among Holsteiners at 77; in Bresgau at 80; Schiller's skull shows anindex of breadth even of 82 . . . the Madurese also 82!\" Finally, the same comparison between the oldest skulls knownand the European, brings to light the startling fact \"that most of these old skulls, belonging to the stone period, are aboverather than below the average of the brain of the now living man in volume.\" Calculating the measures for the height,breadth, and length in inches from the average measurements of several skulls, the following sums are obtained:--1. Old Northern skulls of the stone age . . . . . . . . . . . . 18.877 ins.2. Average of 48 skulls of the same period from England . . . . 18.858 \"3. Average of 7 skulls of the same period from Wales . . . . . 18.649 \"4. Average of 36 skulls of the stone age from France . . . . . 18.220 \"The average of the now living Europeans is 18.579 inches; of Hottentots, 17.795 inches!Which figures show plainly \"that the size of the brain of the oldest populations known to us is not such as to place themon a lower level than that of the now living inhabitants of the Earth\" (\"The Age and Origin of Man\"). Besides which, theyshow the \"missing link\" vanishing into thin air. Of these, however, more anon: we must return to our direct subject.The race which Jupiter so ardently desired \"to quench, and plant a new one in its stead\" (AEsch.* 241), suffered mental,not physical misery. The first boon Prometheus gave to mortals, as he tells the \"Chorus,\" was to hinder them \"fromforeseeing death\" (256); he \"saved the mortal race from sinking blasted down to Hades' gloom\" (244); and then only,\"besides\" that, he gave them fire (260). This shows plainly the dual character, at any rate of the Promethean myth, ifOrientalists will not accept the existence of the seven keys taught in Occultism. This relates to the first opening of man'sspiritual perceptions, not to his first seeing or discovering fire. For fire was never \"discovered,\" but existed on earth sinceits beginning. It existed in the seismic activity of the early ages, volcanic eruptions being as frequent and constant inthose periods as fog is in England now. And if we are told that men appeared so late on Earth that nearly all thevolcanoes, with the exception of a few, were already extinct, and that geological disturbances had made room for a moresettled state of things, we answer: Let a new race of men -- whether evolved from angel or gorilla -- appear now on anyuninhabited[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Prometheus Vinctus.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 524 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.spot of the globe, with the exception perhaps of the Sahara, and a thousand to one it would not be a year or two oldbefore discovering fire, through the fall of lightning setting in flames grass or something else. This assumption, thatprimitive man lived ages on earth before he was made acquainted with fire, is one of the most painfully illogical of all. Butold AEschylus was an initiate, and knew well what he was giving out.*No occultist acquainted with symbology and the fact that Wisdom came to us from the East, will deny for a moment thatthe myth of Prometheus has reached Europe from Aryavarta. Nor is he likely to deny that in one sense Prometheusrepresents fire by friction. Therefore, he admires the sagacity of M. F. Baudry, who shows in his Les Mythes du feu etbreuvage celeste (Revue germanique, 1861 p. 356)** one of the aspects of Prometheus and his origin from India. Heshows the reader the supposed primitive process to obtain fire, still in use to-day in India to light the sacrificial flame. Thisis what he says:--"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"\"This process, such as it is minutely described in the Vedic Sutras, consists in rapidly turning a stick in a socket made inthe centre of a piece of wood. The friction develops intense heat and ends by setting on fire the particles of wood incontact. The motion of the stick is not a continuous rotation, but a series of motions in contrary senses, by means of acord fixed to the stick in its middle: the operator holds one of the ends in each hand and pulls them alternately. . . . Thefull process is designated in Sanskrit by the verb manthami, mathnani; which means 'to rub, agitate, shake and obtain byrubbing,' and is especially applied to rotatory friction, as proved by its derivation from mandala, which signifies a circle. . .. The pieces of wood serving for the production of fire have each their name in Sanskrit. The stick which turns is calledpramantha; the discus which receives it is called arani and aranî: \"the two aranis\" designating the ensemble of theinstrument\" (p. 358 et seq.).***It remains to be seen what the Brahmins will say to this. But supposing Prometheus has been conceived in one of theaspects of his[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The modern attempt of some Greek scholars (poor and pseudo scholars, they would have appeared in the day of theold Greek writers!) to explain the real meaning of the ideas of AEschylus, which, being an ignorant ancient Greek, hecould not express so well himself, is absurdly ludicrous!** See also his Memoires de la Societe de la Linguistique following the \"Fire Myths,\" (Vol. I, p. 337, et seq.)*** There is the upper and nether piece of timber used to produce this sacred fire by attrition at sacrifices, and it is thearanî which contains the socket. This is proven by an allegory in the Vayu Purana and others, which tell us that Nemi, theson of Ikshwaku, had left no successor, and that the Rishis, fearing to leave the earth without a ruler, introduced theking's body into the socket of an aranî -- like an upper aranî -- and produced from it a prince named Janaka. \"It was byreason of the peculiar way in which he was engendered that he was called Janaka.\" (But see Goldstucker's SanskritDictionary at the word Arani.)

Decharme, at any rate,seems to have a correct glimmering of the truth; for he unconsciously corroborates by his remarks all that the Occultsciences teach with regard to the Manasa Devas, who have endowed man with the consciousness of his immortal soul:that consciousness which hinders man \"from foreseeing death,\" and makes him know he is immortal.* \"How hasPrometheus got into the possession of the (divine) spark?\" he asks. \"Fire having its abode in heaven, it is there he musthave gone to find it before he could carry it down to men, and, to approach the gods, he must have been a god himself.\"The Greeks held that he was of the divine race; the Hindus, that he was a Deva. Hence \"with the Greeks he was the sonof the Titan lapetos,\" [[Iapetonides]] (Theog. 528) . . . . \"But celestial fire belonged in the beginning to the gods alone; itwas a treasure they reserved for themselves . . . over which they jealously watched . . . 'The prudent son of Iapetus,' saysHesiod, 'deceived Jupiter by stealing and concealing in the cavity of a narthex, the indefatigable fire of the resplendentglow' (Theog. 565) . . . Thus the gift made by Prometheus to men was a conquest made from heaven. . . \" \"Nowaccording to Greek ideas,\" (identical in this with those of the Occultists) \"this possession forced from Jupiter, this humantrespassing upon the property of the gods, had to be followed by an expiation. . . . Prometheus, moreover, belongs to thatrace of Titans who had rebelled** against the gods, and whom the master of Olympus had hurled down into Tartarus; likethem, he is the genius of Evil, doomed to cruel suffering, etc., etc.\"That which is revolting in the explanations that follow, is the one-sided view taken of this grandest of all the myths. Themost intuitional among modern writers cannot or will not rise in their conceptions above the level of the Earth and Cosmicphenomena. It is not denied that the moral idea in the myth, as presented in the Theogony of Hesiod, plays a certain partin the primitive Greek conception. The Titan is more than a thief of the celestial fire. He is the representation of humanity -- active, industrious, intelligent, but at the same time ambitious, which aims at equalling divine powers. Therefore it ishumanity punished in the person of Prometheus, but it is only so with the Greeks. With the latter, Prometheus is not a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The monad of the animal is as immortal as that of man, yet the brute knows nothing of this; it lives an animal life ofsensation just as the first human would have lived, when attaining physical development in the Third Race, had it notbeen for the Agnishwatta and the Manasa Pitris.** The fallen angels, therefore; the Asuras of the Indian Pantheon.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 526 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.criminal, save in the eyes of the gods. In his relation with the Earth, he is, on the contrary, a god himself, a friend ofmankind ([[philanthropos]]), which he has raised to civilization and initiated into the knowledge of all the arts; a conceptionwhich found its most poetical expounder in AEschylus. But with all other nations Prometheus is -- what? The fallen Angel,Satan, as the Church would have it? Not at all. He is simply the image of the pernicious and dreaded effects of lightning.He is the \"evil fire\" (mal feu) and the symbol of the divine reproductive male organ. \"Reduced to its simple expression, themyth we are trying to explain is then simply a (Cosmic) genius of fire\" (p. 261). It is the former idea (the phallic) which waspre-eminently Aryan, if we believe Ad. Kuhn (in his Herabkunft des Feuers und des Gottertranks) and Baudry. For --\"The fire used by man being the result of the action of pramantha in the arani, the Aryas must have ascribed (?) the sameorigin to celestial fire, and they must* have imagined (?) that a god armed with pramantha, or a divine pramantha,"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"exercised in the bosom of the clouds a violent friction, which gave birth to lightning and thunderbolts. . . . . This idea issupported by the fact that, according to Plutarch's testimony (Philosoph. Plant., iii. 3), the Stoics thought that thunder wasthe result of the struggle of storm-clouds and lightning -- a conflagration due to friction; while Aristotle saw in thethunderbolt only the action of clouds which clashed with each other. What was this theory, if not the scientific translationof the production of fire by friction? . . . . . . Everything leads us to think that, from the highest antiquity, and before thedispersion of the Aryans, it was believed that the pramantha lighted fire in the storm cloud as well as in the aranis.\"(Revue Germanique, p. 368.)Thus, suppositions and idle hypotheses are made to stand for discovered truths. Defenders of the Bible dead-letter couldnever help the writers of missionary tracts more effectually, than do materialistic Symbologists in thus taking for grantedthat the ancient Aryans based their religious conceptions on no higher thought than the physiological.But it is not so, and the very spirit of Vedic philosophy is against such an interpretation. And if, as Decharme himselfconfesses, \"this idea of the creative power of fire is explained at once by the ancient assimilation of the human soul to acelestial spark,\" as shown by the imagery often made use of in the Vedas when speaking of Arani, it would meansomething higher than simply a gross sexual conception. A hymn to Agni in the Veda is cited as example:-- \"Here is thepramantha, the generator is ready. Bring the mistress of the race (the female Arani). Let us produce Agni by attrition,according[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The italics are ours; they show how assumptions are raised to laws in our day.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 527 THE SIX BROTHERS OF KRISHNA.to ancient custom\" -- which means no worse than an abstract idea expressed in the tongue of mortals. The \"femaleArani,\" the mistress of the race, is Aditi, the mother of the gods, or Shekinah, eternal light -- in the world of Spirit, the\"Great Deep\" and CHAOS; or primordial Substance in its first remove from the UNKNOWN, in the manifested Kosmos. If,ages later, the same epithet is applied to Devaki, the mother of Krishna, or the incarnated LOGOS; and if the symbol,owing to the gradual and irrepressible spread of exoteric religions, may already be regarded as having a sexualsignificance, this in no way mars the original purity of the image. The subjective had been transformed into the objective;Spirit had fallen into matter. The universal kosmic polarity of Spirit-Substance had become, in human thought, the mystic,but still sexual union of Spirit and Matter, and had thus acquired an anthropomorphic colouring which it had never had inthe beginning. Between the Vedas and the Puranas there is an abyss of which both are the poles, like the seventh (atmic)and the first or lowest principle (the physical body) in the Septenary constitution of man. The primitive, purely spirituallanguage of the Vedas, conceived many decades of millenniums earlier, had found its purely human expression for thepurpose of describing events taking place 5,000 years ago, the date of Krishna's death (from which day the Kali Yuga, orBlack-Age, began for mankind).As Aditi is called Surarani (the matrix or \"mother\" of the sura gods), so Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas, is called inMahabharata Pandavarani -- which term is already physiologized. But Devaki, the antetype of the Roman CatholicMadonna, is a later anthropomorphized form of Aditi. The latter is the goddess mother, the \"Deva-matri\" of Seven Sons(the six and the seven Adityas of early Vedic times); the mother of Krishna, Devaki, has six embryos conveyed into herwomb by Jagaddhatri (the \"nurse of the world\"), the seventh (Krishna, the Logos,) being transferred to that Rohini. Mary,the mother of Jesus, is the mother of seven children, of five sons and two daughters, (a later transformation of sex) inMatthew's Gospel (xiii. 55-56). No one of the worshippers of the Roman Catholic Virgin would object to reciting in herhonour the prayer addressed by the gods to Devaki. Let the reader judge.\"Thou art that Prakriti (essence), infinite and subtile, which bore Brahma in its womb. Thou eternal being, comprising inthy substance the essence of all created things, wast identical with creation; thou wast the parent of the triform sacrifice,becoming the germ of all. . . . Thou art sacrifice, whence all fruit proceeds; thou art the arani whose attrition engendersfire\" . . . . (\"Womb of Light,\" \"holy Vessel,\" are the epithets of the Virgin). \"As Aditi, thou art the parent of the gods. . . .Thou art Jyotsna (the morning twilight).\" The Virgin------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 528 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.is often addressed as the \"morning Star\" and the \"star of Salvation\" -- the light whence day is begotten. \"Thou art Samnati(humility, a daughter of Daksha), the mother of Wisdom; thou art Niti, the parent of harmony (Naya); thou art modesty, theprogenitrix of affection (Prasraya or vinaya); thou art desire, of whom love is born. . . . Thou art the mother of knowledge(Avabodha); patience (Dhriti), the parent of fortitude (Dhairya) . . . . etc., etc.\"Thus arani is shown here as the Roman Catholic \"vase of election\" and no worse. As to its primitive meaning, it waspurely metaphysical. No unclean thought traversed these conceptions in the ancient mind. Even in the Zohar -- far lessmetaphysical than any other symbolism -- the idea is an abstraction and nothing more. Thus, when the Zohar (iii., 290)says: \"All that which exists, all that which has been formed by the ancient, whose name is holy, can only exist through amale and female principle,\" it means no more than this: \"The divine Spirit of Life is ever coalescing with matter.\" It is theWILL of the Deity that acts; and the idea is purely Schopenhauerian. \"When Atteekah Kaddosha, the ancient and theconcealed of the concealed, desired to form all things, it formed all things like male and female. This wisdom cornprisesALL when it goeth forth.\" Hence Chochmah (male wisdom) and Binah (female consciousness or Intellect) are said tocreate all between the two -- the active and the passive principles. As the eye of the expert jeweller discerns under therough and uncouth oyster shell the pure immaculate pearl, enshrined within its bosom, his hand dealing with the formerbut to get at its, so the eye of the true philosopher reads between the lines of the Puranas the sublime Vedic truths, andcorrects the form with the help of the Vedantic wisdom. Our Orientalists, however, never perceive the pearl under thethick coating of the shell, and -- act accordingly."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"From all that has been said in this section, one sees clearly that, between the Serpent of Eden and the Devil ofChristianity, there is an abyss.

It is from hisBook that the first notions of the Fallen Angels were taken by the early Christian writers.The \"Book of Enoch\" is declared apocryphal. But what is an Apocrypha? The very etymology of the term shows that it issimply a secret book, i.e., one that belonged to the catalogue of temple libraries under the guardianship of theHierophants and initiated priests, and was never meant for the profane. Apocrypha comes from the verb Crypto,[[krupto]], \"to hide.\" For ages the Enoichion (the Book of the SEER) was preserved in the \"city of letters\" and secret works-- the ancient Kirjath-Sepher, later on, Debir (see Joshua xv., 15).Some of the writers interested in the subject -- especially Masons -- have tried to identify Enoch with Thoth of Memphis,the Greek Hermes, and even with the Latin Mercury. As individuals, all these are distinct one from the other;professionally -- if one may use this word, now so limited in its sense -- they belong one and all to the same category ofsacred writers, of Initiators and Recorders of Occult and ancient Wisdom. Those who in the Quran (see Surat XIX.) aregenerically termed the Edris, or the \"Learned\" (the Initiated), bore in Egypt the name of \"Thoth,\" the inventor of arts,sciences, writing or letters, of music and astronomy. Among the Jews the Edris became \"Enoch,\" who, according to Bar-Hebraeus, \"was the first inventor of writing,\" books, arts, and sciences, the first who reduced to a system the progress ofthe planets. In Greece he was called Orpheus, and thus changed his name with every nation. The number Seven beingattached to, and connected with, each of those primitive Initiators,* as well as the number 365, of the days in the year,astronomically, it identifies the mission, character, and the sacred office of all those men, but certainly not theirpersonalities. Enoch is the seventh Patriarch; Orpheus is the possessor of the phorminx, the 7-stringed lyre, which is theseven-fold mystery of initiation. Thoth, with the seven-rayed Solar Discus on his head, travels in the Solar boat, the 365degrees, jumping out every fourth (leap) year for one day. Finally, Thoth-Lunus is the septenary[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Khanoch, or Hanoch, or Enoch means the \"Initiator\" and \"teacher,\" as well as the \"Son of Man,\" Enos (vide Genesis iv.,26), esoterically.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 530 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.god of the seven days, or the week. Esoterically and spiritually, Enoichion means the \"Seer of the Open Eye.\"The story about Enoch, told by Josephus, namely, that he had concealed under the pillars of Mercury or Seth hisprecious rolls or books, is the same as that told of Hermes, \"the father of Wisdom,\" who concealed his books of Wisdomunder a pillar, and then, finding the two pillars of stone, found the science written thereon. Yet Josephus, notwithstandinghis constant efforts in the direction of Israel's unmerited glorification, and though he does attribute that science (ofWisdom) to the Jewish Enoch -- writes history. He shows those pillars as still existing during his own time. He tells us thatthey were built by Seth; and so they may have been, only neither by the Patriarch of that name, the fabled son of Adam,nor by the Egyptian god of Wisdom -- Teth, Set, Thoth, Tat, Sat (the later Sat-an), or Hermes, who are all one, -- but bythe \"sons of the Serpent-god,\" or \"Sons of the Dragon,\" the name under which the Hierophants of Egypt and Babylonwere known before the Deluge, as were their forefathers, the Atlanteans.What Josephus tells us, therefore, must be allegorically true, with the exception of the application made of it. According tohis version the two famous pillars were entirely covered with hieroglyphics, which, after the discovery, were copied andreproduced in the most secret corners of the inner temples of Egypt, and have thus become the source of its Wisdom andexceptional learning. These two \"pillars,\" however, are the prototypes of the two \"tables of stones\" hewn by Moses at thecommand of the \"Lord.\" Hence, in saying that all the great adepts and mystics of antiquity -- like Orpheus, Hesiod,Pythagoras and Plato -- got the elements of their theology from those hieroglyphics, he is right in one sense, and wrongin another; for he errs in accuracy. The Secret Doctrine teaches us that the arts, sciences, theology, and especially thephilosophy of every nation which preceded the last universally known, but not universal Deluge, had been recordedideographically from the primitive oral records of the Fourth Race, and that these were the inheritance of the latter fromthe early Third Root-Race before the allegorical Fall. Hence, also, the Egyptian pillars, the tablets, and even the \"whiteOriental porphyry stone\" of the Masonic legend -- which Enoch, fearing that the real and precious secrets would be lost,concealed before the Deluge in the bowels of the Earth -- were simply the more or less symbolical and allegorical copiesfrom the primitive Records. The \"Book of Enoch\" is one of such copies and is a Chaldean, now very incompletecompendium. As already said, Enoichion means in Greek the \"inner eye,\" or the Seer; in Hebrew, and with the help ofMasoretic points it means the initiator and instructor, [[hebrew]]. It is a generic title; besides which his legend is------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 531 THE ADEPT DIES BUT TO LIVE.that of several other prophets, Jewish and heathen, with changes of made-up details, the root-form being the same. Elijahis also taken up into Heaven alive; and the astrologer, at the court of Isdubar, the Chaldean Hea-bani, is likewise raisedto heaven by the god Hea, who was his patron, as Jehovah was of Elijah (whose name means in Hebrew \"God-Jah,\""},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Jehovah, [[hebrew]]), and again of Elihu, which has the same meaning. This kind of easy death, or euthanasia, has anesoteric meaning. It symbolises the death of any adept who has reached the power and degree, as also the purification,which enable him to die only in the physical body and still live and lead a conscious life in his astral body. The variationson this theme are endless, but the secret meaning is ever the same. The Pauline expression (Hebrews xi. 5) \"that heshould not see death\" -- ut non videret mortem -- has thus an esoteric meaning, but nothing supernatural in it. Themangled interpretation given of some Biblical hints to the effect that Enoch, \"whose years will equal those of the world,\"(of the Solar year, 365 days,) will share with Christ and the prophet Elijah the honours and bliss of the last advent and ofthe destruction of Antichrist -- signify, esoterically, that some of the great adepts will return in the Seventh Race, when allError will be made away with, and the advent of TRUTH will be heralded by those Sishta, the holy \"Sons of Light.\"The Latin church is not always logical, nor prudent either. She declares the \"Book of Enoch\" an apocrypha, and has goneso far as to claim, through Cardinal Cajetan and other luminaries of the Church, the rejection from the Canon of even theBook of Jude, who, though an inspired apostle, quotes from and thus sanctifies the Book of Enoch, which is alleged to bean apocryphal work. Fortunately, some of the dogmatics perceived the peril in time. Had they accepted Cajetan'sresolution, they would have been forced to reject likewise the fourth Gospel; as St. John borrows literally from Enoch, andplaces in the mouth of Jesus, a whole sentence! (Vide supra, § XVIII., sub-sect. A, about the sheep and the robbers.)Ludolph, the \"father of Ethiopic literature,\" commissioned to investigate the various Enochian MSS. presented by Pereisc,the traveller, to the Mazarine Library, declared that \"no book of Enoch could exist among the Abyssinians\"! Furtherresearches and discoveries worsted his too dogmatic assertion, as all know. Bruce and Ruppel found and brought thatsame work from Abyssinia some years later, and Bishop Laurence translated it. But Bruce despised it, and scoffed at its;as did all the rest of the Scientists. He declared it \"a Gnostic work,\" in which \"the age of giants who devour \" men -- isgiven . . . hence it is another \"Apocalypsis.\" Giants! another fairy-tale.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 532 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Such, however, was not the opinion of all the best critics. Dr. Hanneberg places the Book of Enoch along with the ThirdBook of the Maccabees, at the head of the list of those whose authority stands the nearest to that of the canonical works.Verily, \"where doctors disagree . . .\"As usual, however, they were all right and all wrong. To accept Enoch as a Biblical character, a single living man, is likeaccepting Adam as the first one. Enoch was a generic title, applied to, and borne by, scores of individuals, at all timesand ages, and in every race and nation. This may be easily inferred from the fact that the ancient Talmudists and theteachers of Midrashim are not agreed generally in their views about Hanokh, the Son of Yered. . . . Some say Enoch wasa great Saint, beloved by God, and taken alive to heaven (i.e., one who reached Mukti or Nirvana, on earth, as Buddhadid and others still do); and others maintain that he was a sorcerer, a wicked magician. This shows only that Enoch, or itsequivalent, was a term, even during the days of the later Talmudists, which meant \"Seer,\" \"Adept in the Secret Wisdom,\"etc., without any specification as to the character of the title-bearer. When Josephus, speaking of Elijah and Enoch(Antiquities, ix., 2), remarks that \"it is written in the sacred books they (Elijah and Enoch) disappeared, but so that nobodyknew that they died,\" it means simply that they had died in their personalities, as Yogis die to this day in India, or evensome Christian monks to the world. They disappear from the sight of men and die -- on the terrestrial plane -- even forthemselves. A seemingly figurative way of speaking, yet literally true.\"Hanokh transmitted the science of (astronomical) calculation and of computing the seasons to Noah,\" says the MidrashPirkah R. Eliezar (cap. viii.), referring to Henoch that which others did to Hermes Trismegistus, because the two areidentical in their esoteric meaning. \"Hanokh\" in this case, and his \"Wisdom,\" belong to the cycle of the Fourth AtlanteanRace,* and Noah to that of the Fifth.** In this case both represent the Root-Races, the present one and the one thatpreceded it. In another sense, Enoch disappeared, \"he walked with God, and he was not, for God took him,\" the allegoryreferring to the disappearance of the Sacred and Secret knowledge from among men; for \"God\" (or Java Aleim -- the highhierophants, the heads of the colleges of initiated priests***) took him; in other words, the Enochs or the Enoichions, theSeers and their knowledge and wisdom, became strictly[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Says the Zohar, \"Hanokh had a book which was one with the book of the generations of Adam; this is the Mystery ofWisdom.\"** Noah is heir to the Wisdom of Enoch; in other words, the Fifth is heir to the Fourth Race.*** Vide Isis Unveiled, Vol. I, p. 575, et seq.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 533 WHAT ENOCH IS, ESOTERICALLY.confined to the Secret Colleges of the Prophets, with the Jews, and to the temples with the Gentiles.Interpreted with the help of merely the symbolical key, Enoch is the type of the dual nature of man -- spiritual andphysical. Hence he occupies the centre of the astronomical cross (given by Eliphas Levi from a secret work), which is asix-pointed star, \"the Adonai.\" In the upper triangle is the Eagle; in the left lower triangle stands the lion; in the right, thebull: while between the bull and the lion, over them and under the eagle, is the face of Enoch or man. (Vide illustrateddiagram in Isis Unveiled, Vol. II., p. 452). Now the figures on the upper triangle represent the Four Races, leaving out thefirst -- the Chhayas or Shadows -- and the \"Son of Man,\" Enos or Enoch, is in the centre, because he stands between thetwo (the Fourth and the Fifth) Races, as he represents the Secret Wisdom of both. These are the four animals of Ezekieland of the Revelation. The same double triangle which in Isis, Vol. II, (p. 453), faces the Hindu Adanari, is by far the best.For there, only the three (for us) historical races are symbolized: the third, the androgynous, by Ada-nari; the fourth,"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"symbolized by the strong, powerful lion; and the fifth -- the Aryan -- by that which is its most sacred symbol to this day, thebull (and the cow).A man of great erudition -- a French savant -- M. de Sacy, finds several most singular statements in the Book of Enoch,\"worthy of the most serious examination,\" he says. For instance, \"the author (Enoch) makes the solar year consist of 364days, and seems to know periods of three, of five, and of eight years, followed by four supplementary days, which, in hissystem, appear to be those of the equinoxes and solstices.\"* . . . . To which he adds, later on, \"I see but one means topalliate them (these 'absurdities'), it is to suppose that the author expounds some fanciful system which may have existedBEFORE THE ORDER OF NATURE HAD BEEN ALTERED AT THE PERIOD OF THE UNIVERSAL DELUGE.\"Precisely so; and the Secret Doctrine teaches that that \"order of nature\" has been thus altered, and the series of theEarth's humanities too. For, as the angel Uriel tells Enoch: \"Behold, I have showed thee all things, O Enoch; and all thingshave I revealed to thee. Thou seest the Sun, the Moon, and those which conduct the stars in Heaven, which cause alltheir operations, seasons, and arrivals to return. In the days of sinners THE YEARS SHALL BE SHORTENED . . . . themoon shall change its laws, etc.\" (chap. lxxix). In those days also, years before the great Deluge that carried away theAtlanteans and changed the face of the whole earth -- because \"the earth (on its axis) became inclined\" --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Danielo's criticisms upon De Sacy, in the Annales de Philosophic, p. 393.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 534 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.nature, geologically, astronomically, and cosmically in general, could not have been the same, just because the Earth hadinclined. See chap. 1xiv. (Sect. xi.) . . . . \"And Noah cried with a bitter voice 'Hear me, hear me, hear me'; three times.And he said 'The earth labours and is violently inclined; surely, I shall perish with it.' \"This, by the way, looks like one of those many \"inconsistencies,\" if the Bible is read literally. For, to say the least, this is avery strange fear in one who had \"found grace in the eyes of the Lord\" and been told to build an ark! But here we find thevenerable Patriarch expressing as much fear as if, instead of a \"friend\" of God, he had been one of the Giants doomed bythe wrathful deity. The earth has already inclined, and the deluge of waters has become simply a question of time, andyet Noah seems to know nothing of his intended salvation.A decree had come indeed; the decree of nature and the Law of Evolution, that the earth should change its race, and thatthe Fourth Race should be destroyed to make room for a better one. The Manvantara had reached its turning point ofthree and a half Rounds, and gigantic physical Humanity had reached the acme of gross materiality. Hence theapocalyptic verse that speaks of a commandment gone forth that they may be destroyed, \"that their end may be\" (of therace); for they knew truly \"every secret of the angels, every oppressive and secret power of the Satans, and every powerof those who commit sorcery, as well as of those who make molten images in the whole earth.\"And now a natural question. Who could have informed the apocryphal author of this powerful vision (to whatever age hemay be assigned before the day of Galileo) that the Earth could occasionally incline her axis? Whence has he derivedsuch astronomical and geological knowledge if the Secret Wisdom, of which the ancient Rishis and Pythagoras haddrunk, is but a fancy, an invention of the later ages? Has Enoch read prophetically perchance in Frederick Klee's work onthe Deluge (p. 79) these lines: \"The position of the terrestrial globe with reference to the Sun has evidently been, inprimitive times, different from what it is now; and this difference must have been caused by a displacement of the axis ofrotation of the Earth.\"?This reminds one of that other unscientific statement made by the Egyptian priests to Herodotus, namely, that the Sunhas not always risen where it arises now, and that in former times the ecliptic had cut the equator at right angles.*There are many such \"dark sayings\" throughout Puranas, Bible and Mythology; and to the occultist they divulge two facts:(a) that the ancients knew as well, and better, perhaps, than the moderns[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Astronomie Ancienne, Bailly, Vol. I., p. 203, and Vol. II., p. 216.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 535 ST. AUGUSTINE AND ENOCH.do, astronomy, geognosy and cosmography in general; and (b) that the globe and its behaviour have altered more thanonce since the primitive state of things. Thus, on the blind faith of his \"ignorant\" religion, which taught that Phaeton, in hisdesire to learn the hidden truth, made the Sun deviate from its usual course -- Xenophantes asserts somewhere that, \"theSun turned toward another country\"; which is a parallel, however slightly more scientific, if as bold, of Joshua stopping thecourse of the Sun altogether. Yet it may explain the teaching of the Northern mythology (in Jeruskoven) that, before theactual order of things, the Sun arose in the South, and its placing the Frigid Zone in the East, whereas now it is in theNorth.The Book of Enoch, in short, is a resume, a compound of the main features of the History of the Third, Fourth and FifthRaces; a very few prophecies from the present age of the world; a long retrospective, introspective and propheticsummary of universal and quite historical events -- geological, ethnological, astronomical, and psychic -- with a touch oftheogony out of the antediluvian records. The Book of this mysterious personage is referred to and quoted copiously inthe Pistis Sophia, and also in the Zohar and its most ancient Midrashim. Origen and Clement of Alexandria held it in thehighest esteem. To say, therefore, that it is a post-Christian forgery is to utter an absurdity and to become guilty of ananachronism, since Origen, among others, lived in the second century of the Christian era, yet he mentions it as anancient and venerable work.

From the XVIIIth to the Lth chapter, the Visions of Enoch are all descriptive of the Mysteriesof Initiation, one of which is the Burning Valley of the \"Fallen Angels.\"Perhaps St. Augustine was quite right in saying that the Church rejected the BOOK OF ENOCH out of her canon owing toits too great antiquity, ob nimiam antiquitatem.* There was no room for the events noticed in it within the limit of the 4004years B.C. assigned to the world from its \"creation\"![[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* City of God, I. xv. ch. xxiii.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 536 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.§ XXII.THE SYMBOLISM OF THE MYSTERY-NAMES IAO AND JEHOVAH, WITH THEIR RELATION TO THE CROSS ANDCIRCLE.WHEN the Abbe Louis Constant -- known as Eliphas Levi -- said in his Histoire de la Magie that the \"Sepher Jezirah, theZohar, and the Apocalypse (of St. John) are the master-pieces of the Occult Sciences,\" he ought, if he wanted to becorrect and clear, to have added, \"in Europe.\" It is quite true that these works contain \"more significance than words\"; andthat \"its expression is poetical, while in numbers it is exact.\" Unfortunately, before any one can appreciate the poetry ofthe expressions, or the exactness of the numbers, he will have to learn the real significance and meaning of the termsand symbols used. And man will never learn this so long as he remains ignorant of the fundamental principle of theSecret Doctrine, whether in Oriental Esotericism, or in the Kabalistical symbology:-- the key, or value, in all their aspects,of the \"God\"-names, \"Angel\"-names, and \"Patriarchal\" names in the Bible -- their mathematical or geometrical value, andtheir relations to manifested nature.Therefore, if, on the one hand, the Zohar \"astonishes (the mystic) by the profundity of its views and the great simplicity ofits images,\" on the other hand, that work misleads the student by such expressions as those used with respect to AIN-SOPH and Jehovah, notwithstanding the assurance that \"the book is careful to explain that the human form with which itclothes God is but an image of the word, and that God should not be expressed by any thought, or any form.\" It is wellknown that Origen, Clemens, and the Rabbis confessed, with regard to the Kabala and the Bible, to their being veiled andsecret Books; but few know that the esotericism of the Kabalistic books in their present re-edited form is simply anotherand still more cunning veil thrown upon the primitive symbolism of these secret volumes.The idea of representing the hidden deity by the circumference of a Circle, and the Creative Power (male and female, orthe Androgynous WORD), by the diameter across it, is one of the oldest symbols. It is upon this conception that everygreat Cosmogony was built. With the old Aryans, the Egyptians, and the Chaldeans, it was complete, as it embraced theidea of the eternal and immovable Divine Thought in its absoluteness, separated entirely from the incipient stage of (theso-called)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 537 THE JEWS ALONE THE HEIRLOOM OF JEHOVAH.creation; and comprised psychological and even Spiritual evolution, and its mechanical work, or cosmogonicalconstruction. With the Hebrews, however, though the former conception is to be distinctly found in the Zohar, and theSepher Jezirah -- or what remains of the latter -- that which has been embodied subsequently in the Pentateuch proper,and especially in Genesis, is simply this secondary stage, to wit, the mechanical law of creation, or rather of construction;while theogony is hardly, if at all, outlined.It is only in the first six chapters of Genesis, in the rejected Book of Enoch, and the misunderstood and mistranslatedpoem of Job, that true echoes of the archaic doctrine may now be found. The key to it is lost, even among the mostlearned Rabbis, whose predecessors in the early period of the middle ages have preferred, in their national exclusivenessand pride, and especially in their profound hatred of Christianity, to cast it into the deep sea of oblivion, rather than toshare their knowledge with their relentless and fierce persecutors. Jehovah was their own tribal property, inseparablefrom, and unfit to play a part in, any other but the Mosaic Law. Violently torn out of his original frame, which he fitted andwhich fitted him, the \"lord god of Abraham and Jacob\" could hardly be crammed without damage and breakage into thenew Christian Canon. Being the weakest, the Judeans could not help the desecration; but they kept the secret of theorigin of their Adam Kadmon, or male-female Jehovah; and the new tabernacle proved a complete misfit for the old god:they were, indeed, avenged!The statement that Jehovah was the tribal god of the Jews and no higher, will be denied like many other things. Yet thetheologians are not in a position to tell us, in that case, the meaning of verses 8 and 9 in Deuteronomy, chapter xxxii.These verses say quite plainly: \"When the MOST HIGH (not the \"Lord,\" or \"Jehovah\" either) divided to the nations theirinheritance, when he separated the Sons of Adam he set the bounds . . . according to the number of the children ofIsrael. . . . The Lord's (Jehovah's) portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.\" This settles the question. Soimpudent were the modern translators of Bibles and Scriptures and so damaging are these verses, that, following in thesteps traced for them by their worthy Church Fathers, each translator rendered these verses in his own way. While theabove-cited quotation is taken verbatim from the authorized English version, in the French Bible (of the Protestant BiblicalSociety of Paris, according to the version revised in 1824 by J. E. Ostervald) one finds the \"Most High\" translated bySouverain (a Sovereign!!), the \"sons of Adam\" rendered by \"the children of men,\" and the \"Lord\" changed into the\"Eternal.\" For impudent sleight-of-hand, the French Protestant Church seems thus to have surpassed even Englishecclesiasticism.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 538 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, one thing is patent: the \"Lord's (\"Jehovah's\") portion\" is his \"chosen people\" and none else, for, Jacobalone is the lot of his inheritance. What, then, have other nations, who call themselves Aryans, to do with this Semiticdeity, the tribal god of Israel? Astronomically, the \"Most High\" is the Sun, and the \"Lord\" is one of his seven planets,whether it be Iao, the genius of the moon, or Ilda-Baoth-Jehovah, that of Saturn, according to Origen and the EgyptianGnostics.* Let the \"Angel Gabriel,\" the \"Lord\" of Iran, watch over his people; and Michael-Jehovah, over his Hebrews.These are not the gods of other nations, nor were they ever those of Jesus. As each Persian Dev is chained to his planet(see Origen's Copy of the Chart), so each Hindu Deva (a \"Lord\") has its allotted portion, a world, a planet, a nation or arace. Plurality of worlds implies plurality of gods. We believe in the former, and may recognize, but will never worship, thelatter. (Vide Part III., \"On Chains of Worlds and their Plurality.\")It has been repeatedly stated in this work that every religious and philosophical symbol had seven meanings attached toit, each pertaining to its legitimate plane of thought, i.e., either purely metaphysical or astronomical; psychic orphysiological, etc., etc. These seven meanings and their applications are hard enough to learn when taken bythemselves; but the interpretation and the right comprehension of them become tenfold more puzzling, when, instead ofbeing correlated, or made to flow consecutively out of and to follow each other, each, or any one of these meanings isaccepted as the one and sole explanation of the whole symbolical idea. An instance may be given, as it admirablyillustrates the statement. Here are two interpretations given by two learned Kabalists and scholars, of one and the sameverse in Exodus, xxxiii, 18-23. Moses beseeches the Lord to show him his \"glory.\" Evidently it is not the crude dead letterphraseology as found in the Bible that is to be accepted. There are seven meanings in the Kabala, of which we may givetwo as interpreted by the said two scholars. One of them quotes, while explaining: \"Thou canst not see my face . . . I willput thee in the cleft of the rock . . . cover thee with my hand while I pass by. And then I will take away mine hand, andthou shalt see my a'hoor, my back; . . \" and tells us in a gloss, \"That is, I will show you 'My back,' i.e., my visible universe,my lower manifestations, but, as a man still in the flesh, thou canst not[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* With the Egyptian Gnostics it was Thoth (Hermes), who was chief of the Seven (Vide \"Book of the Dead\").

So proceeds the Qabbalah.\" This is correct, and is the cosmo-metaphysical explanation. Andnow speaks the other Kabalist, giving the numerical meaning. As it involves a good many suggestive ideas, and is farmore fully given, we may allow it more space. This synopsis is from an unpublished MS., and explains more fully whatwas given in § XVII, \"The Holy of Holies,\" page 467.The numbers of the name Moses are those of \"I AM THAT I AM,\" so that the names Moses and Jehovah are at one innumerical harmony.The word Moses is [[hebrew]] [[over]] 5,300,40, and the sum of the values of its letters is 345; Jehovah -- the genius parexcellence of the lunar year -- assumes the value of 543, or the reverse of 345. . . . In the third chapter of Exodus, in the13th and 14th verses, it is said: And Moses said . . . Behold when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say untothem, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?and God said unto Moses -- \"I am that I am.\"The Hebrew words for this expression are ahiye asher ahiye, and in the value of the sums of their letters stand thus:--[[hebrew]] [[hebrew]] [[hebrew]]21 501 21. . . This being his (God's) name, the sum of the values composing it are 21, 501, 21 are 543, or simply a use of thesimple digit numbers in the name of Moses . . . but now so ordered that the name of 345 is reversed, and reads 543. . . .So that when Moses asks \"Let me see Thy face or glory,\" the other rightly and truly replies \"Thou canst not see my face\" .. . but thou shalt see me behind -- (the true sense, though not the precise words); because the comer and the behind of543 is the face of 345 -- \"for check and to keep a strict use of a set of numbers to develop certain grand results, for theobject of which they are specifically employed.\" \"In other uses,\" adds the learned Kabalist, \"of the number they saw eachother face to face. It is strange that if we add 345 to 543 we have 888, which was the gnostic Kabalistic value of the nameChrist, who was Jehoshua or Joshua. And so also the division of the 24 hours of the day gives three eights as quotient. . .. The chief end of all this system of number checks was to preserve in perpetuity the exact value of the Lunar year in thenatural measure of days.\"This is the astronomical and numerical meaning in the secret theogony of sidereo-cosmical gods invented by theChaldeo-Hebrews,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Qabbalah, by Isaac Myer.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 540 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and two meanings out of seven. The other five would astonish the Christians still more.The series of OEdipuses who have endeavoured to interpret the riddle of the Sphinx, is long indeed. For many ages shehas been devouring the brightest and the noblest intellects of Christendom; but now the Sphinx is conquered. In the great"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"intellectual struggle which has ended in the complete victory of the OEdipuses of Symbolism, it is not the Sphinx,however, who, burning with the shame of defeat, has had to bury herself in the sea, but verily the many-sided symbol,named Jehovah, whom Christians -- the civilized nations -- have accepted for their God. The latter has collapsed underthe too close analysis, and is -- drowned. Symbologists have discovered with dismay that their adopted deity was only amask for many other gods, an Euhemerized extinct planet, at best, the genius of the Moon and Saturn with the Jews, ofthe Sun and Jupiter, with early Christians; that the Trinity was, in truth, only an astronomical triad -- unless they acceptedthe more abstract and metaphysical meanings given to it by the Gentiles -- composed of the Sun (the Father), and thetwo planets Mercury (the Son) and Venus (the Holy Ghost, Sophia, the Spirit of Wisdom, Love and Truth, and Lucifer, asChrist, the bright and morning Star; vide \"Revelation,\" ch. xxii., 15). Because, if the Father is the Sun (the elder Brother inthe Eastern inner philosophy), the nearest planet to it is Mercury (Hermes, Budha, Thot), the name of whose mother onEarth was Maia; the planet which receives seven times more light than any other: which fact led the Gnostics to call theirChristos, and the Kabalists their Hermes (in the astronomical meaning), the \"seven-fold light\" (vide at end of this §).Finally, this God was Bel; the Sun being \"Bel,\" with the Gauls, \"Helios\" with the Greeks, \"Baal,\" with the Phoenicians; \"El\"in Chaldean, hence \"EL-ohim,\" \"Emanu-EL,\" El, \"god,\" in Hebrew. But even the Kabalistic god has vanished in therabbinical workmanship, and one has now to turn to the innermost metaphysical sense of the Zohar to find in it anythinglike Ain-Soph, the nameless deity and the Absolute, so authoritatively and loudly claimed by the Christians. But it iscertainly not to be found in the Mosaic books, by those who try to read without a Key to them. Ever since it was lost Jewsand Christians have tried their best to blend these two conceptions, but in vain. They have only succeeded in finallyrobbing even the Universal Deity of ITS majestic character and primitive meaning.This is what was said in \"Isis Unveiled\":--It would seem, therefore, but natural to make a difference between the mystery-god [[Iao]], adopted from the highestantiquity by all who participated in the esoteric knowledge of the priests, and his phonetic counterparts, whom we findtreated with so little reverence by the Ophites and other Gnostics.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 541 THE ANTIQUITY OF THE CROSS.In the Ophite gems of King (\"Gnostics\") we find the name of IAO repeated, and often confounded with that of Jevo, whilethe latter simply represents one of the genii antagonistic to Abraxas. But the name IAO neither originated with, nor was itthe sole property of the Jews. Even if it had pleased Moses to bestow the name upon the tutelary \"Spirit,\" the allegedprotector and national deity of the \"chosen people of Israel,\" there is yet no possible reason why other nationalities shouldreceive Him as the Highest and One-living God. But we deny the assumption altogether. Besides, there is the fact thatJaho or Iao was a \"Mystery name\" from the beginning, for [[hebrew]] and [[hebrew]] never came into use before KingDavid. Anterior to his time, few or no proper names were compounded with Iah or Jah. It looks rather as though David,being a sojourner among the Tyrians and Philistines (2 Samuel), brought thence the name of Jehovah. He made Zadokhigh priest, from whom came the Zadokites or Sadducees. He lived and ruled first at Hebron [[hebrew]], Habir-on orKabeir-town, where the rites of the four (mystery-gods) were celebrated. Neither David nor Solomon recognized eitherMoses or the law of Moses. They aspired to build a temple to [[hebrew]], like the structures erected by Hiram to Herculesand Venus, Adon and Astarte.Says Furst: \"The very ancient name of God, Yaho, written in the Greek law, appears, apart from its derivation, to havebeen an old mystic name of the Supreme deity of the Shemites. Hence it was told to Moses when he was initiated at Hor-eb -- the cave -- under the direction of Jethro, the Kenite (or Cainite) priest of Midian. In an old religion of the Chaldeans,whose remains are to be found among the Neo-Platonists, the highest divinity, enthroned above the seven heavens,representing the Spiritual Light-Principle . . . . and also conceived of as Demiurgus,* was called [[Iao]]([[hebrew]]), whowas, like the Hebrew Yaha, mysterious and unmentionable, and whose name was communicated to the Initiated. ThePhoenicians had a Supreme God, whose name was trilateral and secret, and he was [[Iao]].\"** (Isis Unveiled), Vol. II., p.298.)The Cross, say the Kabalists, repeating the lesson of the Occultists, is one of the most ancient -- nay, perhaps, the mostancient of symbols. This is demonstrated at the very beginning of the Proem (Vol. I.). The Eastern Initiates show it coevalwith the circle of Deific infinitude and the first differentiation of the Essence, the union of spirit and matter. This wasrejected, and the astronomical allegory alone was accepted and made to fit into cunningly imagined terrestrial events.Let us demonstrate this statement. In astronomy, as said, Mercury is the son of Coelus and Lux -- of the sky and light, orthe Sun; in mythology he is the progeny of Jupiter and Maia. He is the \"messenger\" of his Father Jupiter, the Messiah ofthe Sun; in Greek, his name \"Hermes,\" means, among other things, the \"Interpreter\" -- the \"Word\" by mouth; the LOGOS,or VERBUM. Now, Mercury, besides being born on Mount Cyllene among shepherds, is the patron of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* By very few though, for the creators of the material universe were always considered as subordinate gods to the MostHigh Deity.** Lydus I., c.

A psychopompic genius, he conducted the souls of the dead to Hades and brought them back, an office attributedto Jesus, after his death and resurrection. The symbols of Hermes-Mercury (Dii Termini) were placed along and at theturning points of highways (as crosses are now placed in Italy) and they were cruciform.* Every seventh day the priestsanointed these termini with oil, and once a year hung them with garlands, hence they were the anointed. Mercury, whenspeaking through his oracles said, \"I am he whom you call the Son of the Father (Jupiter) and Maia. Leaving the King ofHeaven (the Sun) I come to help you, mortals.\" Mercury heals the blind and restores sight, mental and physical.** He wasoften represented as three-headed and called \"Tricephalos,\" \"Triplex,\" as one with the Sun and Venus. Finally, Mercury,"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"as Cornutus*** shows, was sometimes figured under a cubic form, without arms, because \"the power of speech andeloquence can prevail without the assistance of arms or feet.\" It is this cubic form which connects the termini directly withthe cross, and the eloquence or the power of speech of Mercury, which made the crafty Eusebius say \"Hermes is theemblem of the Word which creates and interprets all,\" for it is the creative word; and he shows Porphyry teaching that thespeech of Hermes, (now interpreted \"Word of God\" (!) in Pymander) a creative speech (Verbum), is the seminal principlescattered throughout the Universe.**** In Alchemy \"Mercury\" is the radical Moyst, primitive or elementary water,containing the seed of the Universe, fecundated by the solar fires. To express this fecundating principle, a phallus wasoften added to the cross (the male and female, or the vertical and the horizontal united) by the Egyptians (Vide EgyptianMuseums). The cruciform termini also represented this dual idea, which was found in Egypt in the cubic Hermes. Theauthor of \"Source of Measures\" tells us why. (But see the last page of § XVI., about the Gnostic Priapus).As shown by him, the cube unfolded becomes in display a cross of the tau, or the Egyptian, form; or again, \"the circleattached to the tau gives the ansated cross\" of the old Pharaohs. They had known this from their priests and their \"KingsInitiates\" for ages, and also what was meant by \"the attachment of a man to the cross,\" which idea \"was made to co-ordinate with that of the origin of human life, and hence the phallic form.\" Only the latter came into action aeons and agesafter the idea of the carpenter and artificer of the Gods,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Montfaucon, Antiquities.

As the same author writes: \"the attachment of a man tothe cross . . . was made use of in this very form of display by the Hindus\"; but, made \"to co-ordinate\" with the idea of thenew rebirth of man by spiritual, not physical regeneration. The candidate for initiation was attached to the tau orastronomical cross with a far grander and nobler idea than that of the origin of mere terrestrial life.On the other hand, the Semites seem to have had no other or higher purpose in life than that of procreating their species.Thus, geometrically, and according to the reading of the Bible by means of the numerical method, the author of the\"Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery\" is quite correct. Their (the Jewish) entire system --\"Seems to have been anciently regarded as one resting in nature, and one which was adopted by nature, or God, as thebasis of law of the exertion practically of creative power -- i.e., it was the creative design, of which creation was practicallythe application. This seems to be established by the fact that, under the system set forth, measures of planetary timesserve coordinately as measures of the size of planets, and of the peculiarity of their shapes -- i.e., in the extension of theirequatorial and polar diameters\" . . . etc., etc. (p. 3). . . . \"This system seems to underlie the whole Biblical structure (thatof creative design), as a foundation for its ritualism and for its display of the works of the Deity in the way of architecture,by use of the sacred unit of measure in the Garden of Eden, the Ark of Noah, the Tabernacle, and the Temple ofSolomon.\"Thus, on the very showing of the defenders of this system the Jewish Deity is proved to be, at best, only the manifestedduad, never the One absolute ALL. Geometrically demonstrated, he is a NUMBER; symbolically, an euhemerizedPriapus; and this can hardly satisfy a mankind thirsting after the demonstration of real spiritual truths, and the possessionof a god with a divine, not anthropomorphic, nature. It is strange that the most learned of modem Kabalists can see in thecross and circle nothing but a symbol of the manifested creative and androgyne deity in its relation to, and interferencewith, this phenomenal world.* One author believes that \"man (read the Jew and Rabbi) obtained knowledge of thepractical measure . . . . by which nature was thought to adjust the planets in size to harmonize with the notation of theirmovements\" . . . . and adds: \"it seems he did obtain it, and esteemed its possession as the means of his realization of theDeity -- that is, he approached so nearly to a conception of a Being having a mind like his own, only infinitely morepowerful, as to be able to realize a law of creation[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See the Zohar and the two Qabbalahs (by Messrs. I.

He has nought to do with the ideal conception of the eternal universe. He is, at best, one ofthe creative subordinate powers, the Totality of which is called the \"Sephiroth,\" the \"Heavenly Man,\" and Adam Kadmon,the second logos of the Platonists."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"This very same idea is clearly found at the bottom of the ablest definitions of the Kabala and its mysteries, e.g., by JohnA. Parker, as quoted in the same work:--\"The key of the Kabala is thought to be the geometrical relation of the area of the circle inscribed in the square, or, of thecube to the sphere, giving rise to the relation of diameter to circumference of a circle with the numerical value of thisrelation expressed in integrals. The relation of diameter to circumference, being a supreme one connected with the god-names of Elohim and Jehovah (which terms are expressions numerically of these relations respectively, the first being ofcircumference, the latter of diameter), embraces all. Two expressions of circumference to diameter in integrals are usedin the Bible: (1) The perfect, and (2) the imperfect. One of the relations between these is such that (2) subtracted from (1)will leave a unit of a diameter value in terms, or in the denomination of the circumference value of the perfect circle, or aunit straight line having a perfect circular value, or a factor of circular value\" (p. 22).Such calculations can lead one no further than to unriddle the mysteries of the third stage of Evolution, or the \"thirdcreation of Brahma.\" The initiated Hindus know how to \"square the circle\" far better than any European. But of this moreanon. The fact is that the Western Mystics commence their speculation only at that stage when the universe \"falls intomatter,\" as the occultists say. Throughout the whole series of Kabalistic books we have not met with one sentence thatwould hint in the remotest way at the psychological and spiritual, as well as at the mechanical and physiological secretsof \"creation.\" Shall we, then, regard the evolution of the Universe as simply a prototype, on a gigantic scale, of the act ofprocreation? as \"divine\" Phallicism, and rhapsodize on it as the evilly-inspired author of a late work of this name hasdone? The writer does not think so. And she feels justified in saying so, since the most careful reading of the OldTestament -- esoterically, as well as exoterically -- seems to have carried the most enthusiastic enquirers no further thana certainty on mathematical grounds that from the first to the last chapter of the Pentateuch every scene, every characteror event are shown connected, directly or indirectly, with the origin of birth in its crudest and most------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 545 A PLAGIARISM BY PASCAL.brutal form. Thus, however interesting and ingenious the rabbinical methods, the writer, in common with other EasternOccultists, must prefer those of the Pagans.It is not, then, in the Bible that we have to search for the origin of the Cross and Circle, but beyond the Flood. Therefore,returning to Eliphas Levi and the Zohar, we answer for the Eastern Occultists and say that, applying practice to principle,they agree entirely with Pascal, who says that \"God is a circle, the centre of which is everywhere and the circumferencenowhere,\" whereas the Kabalists say the reverse, and maintain it solely out of their desire to veil their doctrine. By theway, the definition of Deity by the Circle is not Pascal's at all, as E. Levi thought. It was borrowed by the Frenchphilosopher from either Mercury Trismegistus or Cardinal Cusa's Latin work, De Docta Ignorantia, in which he makes useof it. It is, moreover, disfigured by Pascal, who replaces the words \"Cosmic Circle,\" which stand symbolically in theoriginal inscription, by the word Theos. With the ancients both words were synonymous.-------A.CROSS AND CIRCLE.Something of the divine and the mysterious has ever been ascribed, in the minds of the ancient philosophers, to theshape of the circle. The old world, consistent in its symbolism with its pantheistic intuitions, uniting the visible and theinvisible Infinitudes into one, represented Deity and its outward VEIL alike -- by a circle. This merging of the two into aunity, and the name theos given indifferently to both, is explained, and becomes thereby still more scientific andphilosophical. Plato's etymological definition of the word theos has been shown elsewhere. He derives it from the verb[[theein]] (see Cratylus), \"to move,\" as suggested by the motion of the heavenly bodies which he connects with deity.According to the Esoteric philosophy, this Deity is during its \"nights\" and its \"days\" (i.e., cycles of rest or activity) \"theeternal perpetual motion,\" \"the EVER-BECOMING, as well as the ever universally present, and the ever Existing.\" Thelatter is the root-abstraction, the former -- the only possible conception in human mind, if it disconnects this deity from anyshape or form. It is a perpetual, never-ceasing evolution, circling back in its incessant progress through aeons of durationinto its original status -- ABSOLUTE UNITY.It was only the minor gods, who were made to carry the symbolical attributes of the higher ones. Thus, the god Shoo, thepersonification of Ra, who appears as \"the great Cat of the Basin of Persea, in An\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 546 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(See \"Book of the Dead,\" Ritual XVII, 45-47), was often represented in the Egyptian monuments seated, and holding across, symbol of the four quarters, or the Elements, attached to a Circle.In that very learned work, \"The Natural Genesis,\" by Mr. Gerald Massey, on pp. 408-455 (Vol. I.), under the heading,\"Typology of the Cross,\" there is more information to be had on the cross and circle than in any other work we know of.He who would fain have proofs of the antiquity of the Cross is referred to these two volumes. The author shows that \"thecircle and the cross are inseparable. . . . The crux ansata unites the circle and cross of the four corners. From this originthey came to be interchangeable at times. For example, the Chakra, or Disk of Vishnu, is a circle. The names denote thecircling, wheeling round, periodicity, the wheel of time. This the god uses as a weapon to hurl at the enemy. In likemanner, Thor throws his weapon, the Fylfot, a form of the four-footed cross (Swastica) and a type of the four quarters.Thus the cross is equivalent to the circle of the year. . . . The wheel emblem unites the cross and circle in one, as doesthe hieroglyphic cake and the Ankh-tie [[diagram]].\"Nor was the double glyph sacred with the profane, but only with the Initiates. For Raoul-Rochette shows (ibid) \"the sign[[diagram]], occurring as the reverse of a Phoenician coin, with a Ram as the obverse. . . . .The same sign, sometimes"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"called Venus' Looking-Glass, because it typified reproduction, was employed to mark the hind-quarters of valuable broodmares of Corinthian and other beautiful breeds of horses\" (Raoul-Rochette, loc. cit. De La Croix Ansee, Mem. del'Academie des Sciences, pl. 2, Nos. 8, 9, also 16, 2, p. 320, quoted in \"Nat. Gen.\"), which proves that so far back asthose early days the cross had already become the symbol of human procreation, and that oblivion of the divine origin ofCross and Circle had been forgotten.Another form of the cross is given from the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (vol. xviii., p. 393, pl. 4):--\"At each of the four corners is placed a quarter arc of an oviform curve, and when the four are put together they form anoval; thus the figure combines the cross with the circle round in four parts, corresponding to the four corners of the cross.The four segments answer to the four feet of the Swastica cross and the Fylfot of Thor. The four-leaved lotus flower ofBuddha, is likewise figured at the centre of this cross, the lotus being an Egyptian and Hindu type of the four quarters.The four quarter arcs, if joined together, would form an ellipse, and the ellipse is also figured on each arm of the cross.This ellipse therefore denotes the path of the earth . . . .

Simpson copied the following specimen [[diagram]],which is here presented, as the cross of the two equinoxes and the two solstices placed within the figure of the earth'spath.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 547 VARIATIONS OF THE SYMBOLISM.The same ovoid or boat-shaped figure appears at times in the Hindu drawings with seven steps at each end as a form ora mode of Meru.\"This is the astronomical aspect of the double glyph. There are six more aspects, however, and an attempt may be madeto interpret a few of these. The subject is so vast that it would require in itself alone many volumes.But the most curious of these Egyptian symbols of Cross and Circle, spoken of in the above cited work, is one whichreceives its full explanation and final colour from Aryan symbols of the same nature. Says the author:--\"The four-armed Cross is simply the cross of the four quarters, but the cross sign is not always simple.* This is a type thatwas developed from an identifiable beginning, which was adapted to the expression of various ideas afterwards. Themost sacred cross of Egypt that was carried in the hands of the gods, the Pharaohs, and the mummied dead, is the Ankh[[diagram]] the sign of life, the living, an oath, the covenant . . . The top of this is the hieroglyphic Ru [[diagram]] setupright on the Tau-Cross. The Ru is the door, gate, mouth, the place of outlet. This denotes the birth-place in the northernquarter of the heavens, from which the Sun is reborn. Hence the Ru of the Ankh sign is the feminine type of the birth-place, representing the north. It was in the NORTHERN QUARTER that the GODDESS OF THE SEVEN STARS, calledthe \"Mother of the Revolutions,\" gave birth to time in the earliest cycle of the year. The first sign of this primordial circleand cycle made in heaven is the earliest shape of the Ankh-cross [[diagram]], a mere loop which contains both a circleand the cross in one image. This loop or noose is carried in front of the oldest genitrix, Typhon of the great Bear, as herArk, the ideograph of a period, an ending, a time, shown to mean one revolution.\"This then represents the circle made in the northern heaven by the Great Bear, which constituted the earliest year oftime, from which we infer that the loop or Ru of the North represents that quarter, the birth-place of time when figured asthe Ru of the Ankh symbol. Indeed this can be proved. The noose is an Ark or Rak type of reckoning. The Ru of theAnkh-cross was continued in the Cypriote [[diagram]] and the Coptic Ro, P.** The Ro, was carried into the Greek cross[[diagram]], which is formed of the Ro and Chi or R-K. . . . The Rak, or Ank, was the sign of all beginning (Arche) on thisaccount, and the Ank-tie is the cross of the North, the hind part of Heaven. . . .\"Now this, again, is entirely astronomical and phallic. The Puranic version in India gives the whole another colour; andwithout, however,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Certainly not; for very often there are symbols made to symbolize other symbols, and these are in turn used inideographs.** The R of the Slavonian and Russian alphabets (the Kyriletza) is also the Latin P.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 548 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.destroying the above interpretation it is made to reveal a portion of its mysteries with the help of the astronomical key,and thus offers a more metaphysical rendering. The \"Ankh-tie\" [[diagram]] does not belong to Egypt alone. It exists underthe name of pasa, a cord which Siva holds in the hand of his right back arm* (Siva having four arms). The Mahadeva isrepresented in the posture of an ascetic, as Maha-Yogi, with his third eye [[diagram]], which is \"the Ru, [[diagram]],setupright on the Tau-Cross\" in another form. The pasa is held in the hand in such a way that it is the first finger and handnear the thumb which make the cross, or loop and crossing. [[diagram]] Our Orientalists would have it to represent a cordto bind refractory offenders with, because, forsooth, Kali, Siva's consort, has the same as an attribute!The pasa has here a double significance, as also has Siva's trisula and every other divine attribute. This significance liesin Siva, as Rudra has certainly the same meaning as the Egyptian ansated cross in its cosmic and mystic meaning. In thehand of Siva it becomes linga and yonic. That which is meant is this: Siva, as said before, is unknown by that name in theVedas; and it is in the white Yajur Veda that he appears for the first time as the great god -- MAHADEVA -- whose symbolis the lingham. In Rig Veda he is called Rudra, the \"howler,\" the beneficent and the maleficent Deity at the same time, theHealer and the Destroyer. In the Vishnu Purana, he is the god who springs from the forehead of Brahma, who separatesinto male and female, and he is the parent of the Rudras or Maruts, half of whom are brilliant and gentle, others, blackand ferocious. In the Vedas, he is the divine Ego aspiring to return to its pure, deific state, and at the same time thatdivine ego imprisoned in earthly form, whose fierce passions make of him the \"roarer,\" the \"terrible.\" This is well shown inthe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, wherein the Rudras, the progeny of Rudra, god of fire, are called the \"ten vital breaths\""},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"(prana, life) with manas, as eleventh, whereas as Siva, he is the Destroyer of that life. Brahma calls him Rudra, and giveshim, besides, seven other names, which names are his seven forms of manifestation, also the seven powers of naturewhich destroy but to recreate or regenerate.Hence the cruciform noose (pasa) in his hand, when he is represented as an ascetic, the Mahayogin, has no phallicsignification, and it, indeed, requires a strong imagination bent in this direction to find such even in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Moor's \"Hindu Pantheon,\" plate xiii.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 549 \"GUHA,\" THE MYSTERIOUS.an astronomical symbol. As an emblem of \"door, gate, mouth, the place of outlet\" it signifies the \"strait gate\" that leads tothe kingdom of heaven, far more than the \"birth-place\" in a physiological sense.It is a Cross in a Circle and Crux Ansata, truly; but it is a Cross on which all the human passions have to be crucifiedbefore the Yogi passes through the \"strait gate,\" the narrow circle that widens into an infinite one, as soon as the innerman has passed the threshold.As to the mysterious constellation of the Seven Rishis in the great Bear, if Egypt made them sacred to \"the oldest genitrix,Typhon\" -- India has connected all these symbols ages ago with time or Yuga revolutions, and the Saptarishis areintimately connected with our present age -- the Dark Kali Yug.* The great Circle of Time, on the face of which fancy inIndia has represented the Tortoise (Kurma, or Sisumara, one of the Avatars of Vishnu), has the Cross placed on it bynature in its division and localisation of stars, planets and constellations. Thus in Bhagavata Purana V., xxx., it is said that\"at the extremity of the tail of that animal, whose head is directed toward the South and whose body is in the shape of aring (Circle), Dhruva (the ex-pole star) is placed; and along that tail are the Prajapati, Agni, Indra, Dharma, etc.; andacross its loins the Seven Rishis.\" This is then the first and earliest Cross and Circle, into the formation of which entersthe Deity (symbolized by Vishnu), the Eternal Circle of Boundless Time, Kala, on whose plane lie crossways all the gods,creatures, and creations born in Space and Time; -- who, as the philosophy has it, all die at the Mahapralaya.Meanwhile it is they, the Seven Rishis, who mark the time and the duration of events in our septenary life cycle. They areas mysterious as their supposed wives, the Pleiades, of whom only one -- she who hides -- has proven virtuous. ThePleiades (Krittika) are the nurses of Karttikeya, the God of War (Mars of the Western Pagans), who is called theCommander of the celestial armies -- or rather of the Siddhas (translated Yogis in heaven, and holy sages on the earth) --\"Siddha-sena,\" which would make Karttikeya identical with Michael, the \"leader of the celestial hosts\" and, like himself, avirgin Kumara.** Verily he is the \"Guha,\" the mysterious one, as much so as are the Saptarshis and the Krittika (sevenRishis and the Pleiades), for the interpretation of all these combined, reveal to the adept the greatest mysteries of occultnature. One point is worth mention in this question of cross and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Described in the \"Mission des Juifs\" by the Marquis St. Yves d'Alveydre, the hierophant and leader of a large party ofFrench Kabalists, as the Golden Age!** The more so since he is the reputed slayer of Tripurasura and the Titan Taraka.

Like Mars, who is alleged by Ovid to have been born of a mother alone (Juno), without the participation of afather, or like the Avatars (Krishna, for instance), in the West as in the East -- Karttikeya is born, but in a still moremiraculous manner -- begotten by neither father nor mother, but out of a seed of Rudra Siva, via Agni, who dropped it intothe Ganges. Thus he is born from fire and water -- a \"boy bright as the Sun and beautiful as the moon.\" Hence he iscalled Agnibhuva (Agni's son) and Ganga-putra (Son of Ganges). Add to this the fact that the Krittika, his nurses, asMatsya Purana shows, are presided over by Agni, or, in the authentic words -- \"The seven Rishis are on a line with thebrilliant Agni,\" and hence are called Agneya -- and the connection is easy to follow.It is, then, the Rishis who mark the time and the periods of Kali-yuga, the age of sin and sorrow. See in the BhagavataPurana XII., II, 2, 6, 32, and Vishnu Purana. Says the latter: \"When the splendour of Vishnu (Krishna) departed forheaven, then did the Kali Yug, during which men delight in sin, invade the world. . . . . When the Seven Rishis were inMagha, the Kali Yug, comprising 1,200 (divine) years (432,000 years of mortals), began; and when from Magha, theyshall reach Purvashadha, then will this Kali age attain its growth, under Nanda and his successors.\"* This is the revolutionof the Rishis \"when the two first stars of the Seven Rishis (of the Great Bear) rise in the heavens, and some lunarasterism is seen at night, at an equal distance between them, then the Seven Rishis continue stationary in thatconjunction for a hundred years,\" a hater of Nanda makes Parasara say. According to Bentley, it is in order to show thequantity of the precession of the equinoxes that this notion originated among the astronomers. It was done \"by assumingan imaginary line, or great circle, passing through the poles of the ecliptic and the beginning of the fixed Magha, whichcircle was supposed to cut some of the stars in the Great Bear. . . . The seven stars being called the Rishis, the Circle soassumed was called the line of the Rishis . . . . and being invariably fixed to the beginning of the lunar asterism Magha,the precession would be noted by stating the degree . . . of any moveable lunar mansion cut by that line or circle as anindex\" (\"Historical View of the Hindu Astronomy,\" p. 65).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"* Nanda is the first Buddhist Sovereign, Chandragupta, against whom all the Brahmins were so arrayed; he of the MoryaDynasty, and the grandfather of Asoka.

Theywere added by the Vaishnavas, who interpolated almost as much, out of Sectarian spite, as the Christian Fathers did.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 551 THE RISHIS AND THE PLEIADES.There was, and still exists, a seemingly endless controversy about the chronology of the Hindus. Here is a point thatcould help to determine -- approximately at least -- the age when the symbolism of the Seven Rishis and their connectionwith the Pleiades began. When Karttikeya was delivered to them by the gods to be nursed, the Krittika were only six --whence Karttikeya is represented with six heads; but when the poetical fancy of the early Aryan symbologists made ofthem the consorts of the Seven Rishis, they were seven. Their names are given, and these are Amba, Dula, Nitatui,Abrayanti, Maghayanti, Varshayanti, and Chupunika. There are other sets of names which differ, however. Anyhow, theSeven Rishis were made to marry the Seven Krittika before the disappearance of the seventh Pleiad. Otherwise, howcould the Hindu astronomers speak of that which, without the help of the strongest telescopes, no one can see? This iswhy, perhaps, in every such case the majority of the events described in the Hindu allegories is fixed upon as \"a veryrecent invention, certainly within the Christian era\"?The oldest MSS. in Sanskrit on astronomy, begin their series of Nakshatras (the 27 lunar asterisms) with the sign ofKrittika, and this can hardly make them earlier than 2780 B.C., (see the \"Vedic Calendar,\" accepted even by theOrientalists); though they get out of the difficulty by saying that the said Calendar does not prove that the Hindus knewanything of astronomy at that date, and assure their readers that, Calendars notwithstanding, the Indian pundits mayhave acquired their knowledge of the lunar mansions headed by Krittika from the Phoenicians, etc. However that may be,the Pleiades are the central group of the system of sidereal symbology. They are situated in the neck of the constellationof Taurus, regarded by Madler and others, in astronomy, as the central group of the system of The Milky Way, and in theKabala and Eastern Esotericism, as the sidereal septenate born from the first manifested side of the upper triangle, theconcealed [[diagram]]. This manifested side is Taurus, the Symbol of ONE (the figure 1), or of the first letter of theHebrew alphabet, Aleph [[hebrew]] (bull or ox) whose synthesis is ten (10), or [[hebrew]] Yodh, the perfect letter andnumber. The Pleiades (Alcyone, especially), are thus considered, even in astronomy, as the central point around whichour Universe of fixed stars revolves, the focus from which, and into which the divine breath, MOTION, works incessantlyduring the Manvantara. Hence -- in the Occult philosophy and its sidereal symbols -- it is this Circle and the starry crosson its face, which play the most prominent part.The Secret Doctrine teaches us that everything in the universe, as well as the universe itself, is formed (created) duringits periodical manifestations -- by accelerated MOTION set into activity by the BREATH of------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 552 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the ever-to-be-unknown power (unknown to present mankind, at any rate) within the phenomenal world. The Spirit of Lifeand Immortality was everywhere symbolized by a circle: hence the serpent biting his tail, represents the circle of Wisdomin infinity; as does the astronomical cross -- the cross within a circle, and the globe, with two wings added to it, which thenbecame the sacred Scarabaeus of the Egyptians, its very name being suggestive of the secret idea attached to it. For theScarabaeus is called in Egypt (in the papyri) Khopirron and Khopri from the verb Khopron \"to become,\" and has thusbeen made a symbol and an emblem of human life and of the successive becomings of man, through the variousperegrinations and metempsychoses (reincarnations) of the liberated Soul. This mystical symbol shows plainly that theEgyptians believed in reincarnation and the successive lives and existences of the Immortal entity. Being, however, anesoteric doctrine, revealed only during the mysteries by the priest-hierophants and the Kings-Initiates to the candidates, itwas kept secret. The incorporeal intelligences (the Planetary Spirits, or Creative Powers) were always represented underthe form of circles. In the primitive philosophy of the Hierophants these invisible circles were the prototypic causes andbuilders of all the heavenly orbs, which were their visible bodies or coverings, and of which they were the souls. It wascertainly a universal teaching in antiquity. (See Ezekiel, ch. 1.)\"Before the mathematical numbers,\" says Proclus (in Quinto Libro, EUCLID), \"there are the Self-moving numbers; beforethe figures apparent -- the vital figures, and before producing the material worlds which move in a Circle, the CreativePower produced the invisible Circles.\"Deus enim et circulus est, says Pherecydes, in his hymn to Jupiter. It was a Hermetic axiom, and Pythagoras prescribedsuch a circular prostration and posture during the hours of contemplation. \"The devotee must approach as much aspossible the form of a perfect circle,\" prescribes the Secret Book. Numa tried to spread among the people the samecustom, Pierius* tells his readers; and Pliny says: \"During our worship, we roll up, so to say, our body in a ring, totumcorpus circumagimur.\"** The vision of the prophet Ezekiel reminds one[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Pierius Vale.** The goddess Basht (or Pasht) was represented with the head of a cat. This animal was sacred in Egypt for severalreasons: as a symbol of the Moon \"the eye of Osiris\" or the \"Sun,\" during night. The cat was also sacred to Sokhit. One ofthe mystic reasons was because of its body being rolled up in a circle when asleep. The posture is prescribed for occultand magnetic purposes, in order to regulate in a certain way the circulation of the vital fluid, with which the cat is pre-eminently endowed. \"The nine lives of a cat\" is a popular saying based on good physiological and occult reasons. Mr. G.Massey gives also an astronomical reason for it which may be found in § I. \"SYMBOLISM.\" \"The cat saw the Sun, had itin its eye by night (was the eye [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 553 THE DEGRADATION OF THE SYMBOL."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"forcibly of this mysticism of the circle, when he beheld a whirl-wind from which came out \"one wheel upon the earth\"whose work \"was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel\" (ch. i. vv. 4-16). . . . \"for the Spirit of the living creature wasin the wheels\" (v. 20).\"Spirit whirleth about continually and returneth again according to his circuits\" -- says Solomon (Eccles. i. 6), who is madein the English translation to speak of the \"Wind,\" and in the original text to refer both to the Spirit and the Sun. But theZohar, the only true glossary of the Kabalistic Preacher, in explanation of this verse, which is, perhaps, rather hazy anddifficult to comprehend, says that \"it seems to say that the sun moves in circuits, whereas it refers to the Spirit under theSun, called the holy Spirit, that moves circularly, toward both sides, that they (It and the Sun) should be united in thesame Essence.\" . . . (Zohar, fol. 87, col. 346.)The Brahmanical \"Golden Egg,\" from within which emerges Brahma, the creative deity, is the \"circle with the CentralPoint\" of Pythagoras, and its fitting symbol. In the Secret Doctrine the concealed UNITY -- whether representingPARABRAHMAM, or the \"GREAT EXTREME\" of Confucius, or the Deity concealed by PHTA, the Eternal Light, or againthe Jewish EN-SOPH, is always found to be symbolized by a circle or the \"nought\" (absolute No-Thing and Nothing,because it is infinite and the ALL); while the god-manifested (by its works) is referred to as the diameter of that circle. Thesymbolism of the underlying idea is thus made evident: the right line passing through the centre of a circle has, in thegeometrical sense, length, but neither breadth or thickness: it is an imaginary and feminine symbol, crossing eternity andmade to rest on the plane of existence of the phenomenal world. It is dimensional, whereas its circle is dimensionless, or,to use an algebraical term, it is the dimension of an equation. Another way of symbolizing the idea is found in thePythagorean sacred Decade which synthesizes, in the dual numeral Ten (the 1 and a circle or cipher), the absolute ALLmanifesting itself in the WORD or generative Power of Creation.-------B.THE FALL OF THE CROSS INTO MATTER.Those who would feel inclined to argue upon this Pythagorean symbol by objecting that it is not yet ascertained, so far, atwhat period of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] of night), when it was otherwise unseen by men (for as the moon reflects thelight of the Sun, so the cat was supposed to reflect it on account of its phosphorescent eyes) . . .

The Yangs and the Yins are a far later invention. [[diagram]] Plato and his school never understood the Deityotherwise, many epithets of his applied to the \"God over all\" ([[ho epi pasi theos]]) notwithstanding. Plato having beeninitiated, could not believe in a personal God -- a gigantic Shadow of Man. His epithets of \"monarch\" and \"Law-giver ofthe Universe\" bear an abstract meaning well understood by every Occultist, who, no less than any Christian, believes inthe One Law that governs the Universe, recognizing it at the same time as immutable. \"Beyond all finite existences,\" hesays, \"and secondary causes, all laws, ideas and principles, there is an INTELLIGENCE or MIND ([[nous]]), the firstprinciple of all principles, the Supreme Idea on which all other ideas are grounded . . . the ultimate substance from whichall things derive their being and essence, the first and efficient cause of all the order, and harmony, and beauty andexcellency, and goodness, which pervades the Universe\" -- who is called, by way of preeminence and excellence, theSupreme** good \"the god\" ([[Theos]]), and \"the god over all.\" These words apply, as Plato himself shows, neither to the\"Creator\" nor to the \"Father\" of our modern Monotheist, but to the ideal and abstract cause. For, as he says, \"this [gkchar], the god over all, is not the truth or the intelligence, but the FATHER of it,\" and its Primal cause. Is it Plato, thegreatest pupil of the archaic Sages, a sage himself, for whom there was but a single object of attainment in this life --REAL KNOWLEDGE -- who would have ever believed in a deity that curses and damns men for ever, on the slightestprovocation?*** Not he, who considered only those to be[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Also in T'sang-t-ung-ky, by Wei-Pa-Yang.** Cocker's \"Christianity and Greek Philosophy,\" xi., p. 377.*** The cry of despair uttered by Count de Montlosier in his Mysteres de la Vie Humaine, p. 117, is a warrant that theCause of \"excellence and goodness,\" supposed by Plato to pervade the Universe is neither his Deity, nor our World. \"Auspectacle de tant [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 555 THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"genuine philosophers and students of truth who possessed the knowledge of the really existing in opposition to mereseeming; of the always existing in opposition to the transitory; and of that which exists permanently in opposition to thatwhich waxes, wanes, and is developed and destroyed alternately.* Speusippus and Xenocrates followed in his footsteps.The ONE, the original, had no existence, in the sense applied to it by mortal men. \"The [[timion]] (honoured one) dwells inthe centre as in the circumference, but it is only the reflection of the Deity -- the world Soul\"** -- the plane of the surface ofthe circle. The Cross and Circle are a universal conception -- as old as human mind itself. They stand foremost on the listof the long series of, so to say, international symbols, which expressed very often great scientific truths, besides theirdirect bearing upon psychological, and even physiological mysteries; and this symbol is precisely one of this kind, and isbased upon the oldest esoteric cosmogony.It is no explanation to say, as Eliphas Levi does, that God, the universal Love, having caused the male unit to dig anabyss in the female Binary, or chaos, produced thereby the world. Besides being as gross a conception as any, it doesnot remove the difficulty of conceiving it without losing one's veneration for the rather too human-like ways of the Deity. Itis to avoid such anthropomorphic conceptions that the Initiates never use the epithet \"God\" to designate the One andSecondless Principle in the Universe; and that -- faithful in this to the oldest traditions of the Secret Doctrine the worldover -- they deny that such imperfect and often not very clean work could ever be produced by Absolute Perfection. Thereis no need to mention here other still greater metaphysical difficulties. Between speculative Atheism and idioticanthropomorphism there must be a philosophical mean, and a reconciliation. The Presence of the Unseen Principlethroughout all nature, and the highest manifestation of it on Earth -- MAN, can alone help to solve the Problem, which isthat of the mathematician whose x must ever elude the grasp of our terrestrial algebra.

Exoterically -- both are wrong; esoterically both of them are very near thetruth. Alone, among the Apostles of the Western religion, Paul seems to have fathomed -- if not actually revealed -- thearchaic mystery of the Cross. As for the rest of those who, by unifying and individualizing the Universal Presence, havethus synthesized it into one symbol -- the central Point in the Crucifix -- they have shown thereby that they have neverseized the true Spirit of the teaching of Christ, and by their interpretations they have degraded it in more than one way.They have forgotten the Spirit of that universal symbol and have selfishly monopolized it -- as though the Boundless andthe Infinite can ever be limited and conditioned to one manifestation individualized in one man, or even in a nation!The four arms of the \"[[diagram]],\" the decussated cross, and of the \"Hermetic,\" pointing to the four cardinal points -- werewell understood by the mystical minds of the Hindus, Brahmins and Buddhists, thousands of years before it was heard ofin Europe; and that symbol was and is found all over the world. They bent the ends of that cross and made of it theirSwastica [[diagram]] now the Wan of the Buddhist Mongolian.* It implies that the \"Central point\" is not limited to oneindividual, however perfect. That the Principle (God) is in Humanity, and Humanity, as all the rest, is in it, like drops ofwater are in the Ocean, the four ends being toward the four cardinal points, hence losing themselves in infinity.Isarim, an Initiate, is said to have found at Hebron, on the dead body of Hermes, the well known Smaragdine tablet,which, it is said, contained the essence of Hermetic wisdom . . . . \"Separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from thegross . . . .

In one of the basso-relievos of the Palace of Palenque, on the west side, sculptured as ahieroglyphic right under the seated figure, is a Tau. The standing figure, which leans over the first one, is in the act ofcovering its head with the left hand with the veil of initiation; while it extends its right with the index and middle fingerpointing to heaven. The position is precisely that of a Christian bishop giving his blessing, or the one in which Jesus isoften represented while at the Last Supper. . . . The Egyptian Hierophant had a square head-dress which he had to wearalways during his functions. . . . The perfect Tau, formed of the perpendicular (descending male ray), and a horizontal line(matter, female principle), and the mundane circle was an attribute of Isis, and it is but at death that the Egyptian crosswas laid on the breast of the mummy.\" These square hats are worn unto this day by the Armenian priests. The claim thatthe cross is purely a Christian symbol introduced after our era, is strange indeed, when we find Ezekiel stamping theforeheads of the men of Judah, who feared the Lord (Ezekiel ix. 4), with the signum Thau, as it is translated in theVulgate. In the ancient Hebrew this sign was formed thus [[diagram]], but in the original Egyptian hieroglyphics as aperfect Christian cross [[diagram]] (Tat, the emblem of stability). In the Revelation, also, the \"Alpha and Omega\" (spiritand matter), the first and the last, stamps the name of his Father in the foreheads of the elect, (p. 323, Vol. II.) Moses, inExodus xii. 22, orders his people to mark their door-posts and lintels with blood, lest the \"Lord God\" should make amistake and smite some of his chosen people, instead of the doomed Egyptians. And this mark is a tau! The identicalEgyptian handled cross, with the half of which talisman Horus raised the dead, as is shown on a sculptured ruin at Philoe.Enough was said in the text about the Swastica and the Tau. Verily may the Cross be traced back into the very depths ofthe unfathomable Archaic Ages!

The author of the \"Hebrew Egyptian Mystery\" stands perplexed before the endless shadow it throws backinto antiquity, and is unable to trace it to any particular nation or man. He shows the Targums handed down by theHebrews, obscured by translation. In Joshua (viii. 29) read in Arabic, and in the Targum of Jonathan, it is said: \"The kingof Ai he crucified upon a tree.\" The Septuagint rendering is of suspension from a double word (Wordsworth on Joshua.) . .. The strangest expression of this kind is in Numbers xxv. 4, where, by Onkalos (?) it is read: \"Crucify them before theLord (Jehovah) against the Sun.\" \"The word here [[hebrew]], to nail to, is rendered properly (Fuerst) by the Vulgate tocrucify. The very construction of this sentence is mystic.\"So it is, but the spirit of it has been ever misunderstood. \"To crucify before (not against) the sun\" is a phrase used ofinitiation. It comes from Egypt, and primarily from India. The enigma can be unriddled only by searching for its key in theMysteries of Initiation. The initiated adept, who had successfully passed through all the trials, was attached, not nailed,but simply tied on a couch in the form of a tau [[diagram]] (in Egypt) of a Svastika without the four additional prolongations(thus: [[diagram]], not [[diagram]]) plunged in a deep sleep (the \"Sleep of Siloam\" it is called to this day among theInitiates in Asia Minor, in Syria, and even higher Egypt). He was allowed to remain in this state for three days and threenights, during which time his Spiritual Ego was said to confabulate with the \"gods,\" descend into Hades, Amenti, orPatala, (according to the country), and do works of charity to the invisible beings, whether souls of men or ElementalSpirits; his body remaining all the time in a temple crypt or subterranean cave. In Egypt it was placed in the Sarcophagusin the King's Chamber of the Pyramid of Cheops, and carried during the night of the approaching third day to the entranceof a gallery, where at a certain hour the beams of the rising Sun struck full on the face of the entranced candidate, whoawoke to be initiated by Osiris, and Thoth the God of Wisdom.Let the reader who doubts the statement consult the Hebrew originals before he denies. Let him turn to some mostsuggestive Egyptian bas reliefs. One especially from the temple of Philoe, represents a scene of initiation. Two Gods-Hierophants, one with the head of a hawk (the Sun), the other ibis-headed (Mercury, Thoth, the god of Wisdom andsecret learning, the assessor of Osiris-Sun), are standing over the body of a candidate just initiated. They are in the act ofpouring on his head a double stream of water (the water of life and new birth), which stream is interlaced in the shape of across and full of small ansated crosses. This is allegorical of the awakening of the candidate------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 559 ITS EARLY SIGNIFICANCE.(now an Initiate), when the beams of the morning sun (Osiris) strike the crown of his head (his entranced body beingplaced on its wooden tau so as to receive the rays). Then appeared the Hierophants-Initiators, and the sacramentalwords were pronounced, ostensibly, to the Sun-Osiris, addressed in reality to the Spirit Sun within, enlightening thenewly-born man. Let the reader meditate on the connection of the Sun with the Cross in both its generative and spirituallyregenerative capacities -- from the highest antiquity. Let him examine the tomb of Bait-Oxly, in the reign of Ramses II.,where he will find the crosses in every shape and position. So again, on the throne of that sovereign, and finally on afragment from the Hall of the ancestors of Totmes III., preserved in the National Library of Paris, which represents theadoration of Bakhan-Aleare.In this extraordinary sculpture and painting one sees the disc of the Sun beaming upon an ansated cross placed upon across of which those of the Calvary were perfect copies. The ancient MSS. mention these as the \"hard couches of thosewho were in (spiritual) travail, the act of giving birth to themselves.\" A quantity of such cruciform \"couches,\" on which thecandidate, thrown into a dead trance at the end of his supreme initiation, was placed and secured, were found in theunderground halls of the Egyptian temples after their destruction. The worthy and holy Fathers of the Cyril and Theophilustypes used them freely, believing they had been brought and concealed there by some new converts. Alone Origen, andafter him Clemens Alexandrinus and other ex-initiates, knew better. But they preferred to keep silent."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Again, let the reader read the Hindu \"fables,\" as the Orientalists call them, and remember the allegory of Visvakarma, thecreative power, the great architect of the world, called in the Veda \"the all-seeing god,\" who \"sacrifices himself to himself\"(the Spiritual Egos of mortals are his own essence, one with him, therefore). Remember that he is called Deva Vardhika\"the builder of the gods\" and that it is he who ties (the Sun) Surya, his son-in-law, on his lathe, in the exoteric allegory; onthe Swastika, in esoteric tradition, as on earth he is the Hierophant Initiator, and cuts away a portion of his brightness.Visvakarma, remember again, is the Son of Yoga-Siddha, i.e., the holy power of Yoga, and the fabricator of the \"fieryweapon,\" the magic Agneyastra. The narrative is given more fully elsewhere. The author of the Kabalistic work so oftenquoted from, asks:--\"The theoretical use of crucifixion must have been somehow connected with the personification of this symbol (thestructure of the garden of Paradise symbolized by a crucified man). But how? And as showing what? The symbol was ofthe origin of measures, shadowing forth creative law or design. What practically, as regards humanity,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 560 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.could actual crucifixion betoken? Yet, that it was held as the effigy of some mysterious working of the same system, isshown from the very fact of the use. There seems to be deep below deep as to the mysterious workings of these numbervalues -- (the symbolization of the connection of 113 : 355, with 20612 : 6561, by a crucified man). Not only are theyshown to work in the Kosmos . . . . but by sympathy, they seem to work out conditions relating to an unseen and spiritualworld, and the prophets seem to have held knowledge of the connecting link. . . . Reflection becomes more involvedwhen it is considered that the power of expression of the law, exactly, by numbers, clearly defining a system, was not theaccident of the language, but was its very essence, and of its primary organic construction; therefore, neither thelanguage, nor the mathematical system attaching to it, could be of man's invention, unless both were founded upon aprior language, which afterwards became obsolete . . . \" (p. 205).The author proves these points by further elucidation, and reveals the secret meaning of more than one dead-letternarrative, by showing that probably [[hebrew]] man was the primordial word -- \"the very first word possessed by theHebrews, whoever they were, to carry the idea by sound of a man. The essential of this word was 113 (the numericalvalue of that word) from the beginning, and carried with it the elements of the cosmical system displayed.\"This is demonstrated by the Hindu Wittoba -- a form of Vishnu -- as said already. The figure of Wittoba, even to the nail-marks on the feet,* is that of Jesus crucified, in all its details save the Cross; and that MAN was meant is proved to usfurther by the fact of the Initiate being reborn after his crucifixion on the TREE OF LIFE. This \"tree\" has now becomeexoterically, through its use by the Romans as an instrument of torture, and the ignorance of the early Christianschemers, the tree of death!Thus, one of the seven esoteric meanings implied in this mystery of Crucifixion by the mystic inventors of the system --the original elaboration and adoption of which dates back to the very establishment of the MYSTERIES -- is discovered inthe geometrical symbols containing the history of the evolution of man. The Hebrews, whose prophet Moses was solearned in the esoteric Wisdom of Egypt, and who adopted their numerical system from the Phoenicians, and later fromthe Gentiles, from whom they borrowed most of their Kabalistic Mysticism, adapted, most ingeniously, the Cosmic andanthropological symbols of the \"heathen\" nations to their peculiar secret records. If Christian[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Moor's Hindu Pantheon, where Wittoba's left foot bears the mark of the nail -- on the figure of his idol.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 561 THE MEANING OF THE CRUCIFIXION. sacerdotalism has lost the key of it to-day, the early compilers of the Christian Mysteries were well versed in Esotericphilosophy and the Hebrew occult metrology, and used it dexterously. Thus they took the word aish (one of the Hebrewword forms for MAN) and used it in conjunction with that of Shanah \"lunar year,\" so mystically connected with the name ofJehovah, the supposed \"father\" of Jesus, and embosomed the mystic idea in an astronomical value and formula.The original idea of \"Man Crucified\" in Space belongs certainly to the ancient Hindus, and Muir shows it in his \"HinduPantheon\" in the engraving that represents Wittoba. Plato adopted it in his decussated Cross in Space, the [[diagram]],\"the Second God who impressed himself on the Universe in the form of the Cross\"; Krishna is likewise shown \"crucified.\"(See Dr. Lundy's Monumental Christianity, fig. 72.) Again it is repeated in the Old Testament in the queer injunction tocrucify men before the Lord, the Sun -- which is no prophecy at all, but has a direct phallic significance. In § II. of thatsame most suggestive work on the Kabalistic meanings -- \"The Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery,\" we read again:--\"In symbol, the nails of the cross have for the shape of the heads thereof a solid pyramid, and a tapering square obeliscalshaft, or phallic emblem, for the nail. Taking the position of the three nails in the Man's extremities and on the cross, theyform or mark a triangle in shape, one nail being at each corner of the triangle. The wounds or stigmata in the extremitiesare necessarily four designative of the square. . . . The three nails with the three wounds are in number 6, which denotesthe 6 faces of the cube unfolded (which make the cross or man-form, or 7, counting three horizontal and four verticalbars) on which the man is placed; and this in turn points to the circular measure transferred on to the edges of the cube.The one wound of the feet separates into two when the feet are separated, making three together for all, and four whenseparated, or 7 in all -- another most holy (and with the Jews) feminine base number.\"Thus, while the phallic or sexual meaning of the \"Crucifixion Nails\" is proven by the geometrical and numerical reading, itsmystical meaning is indicated by the short remarks upon it, as given above, in its connection with, and bearing upon,Prometheus. He is another victim, for he is crucified on the Cross of Love, on the rock of human passions, a sacrifice tohis devotion to the cause of the spiritual element in Humanity.Now, the primordial system, the double glyph that underlies the idea of the Cross, is not \"of human invention,\" for Cosmicideation and the Spiritual representation of the divine Ego-man are at its basis. Later, it expanded in the beautiful idea"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"adopted by and represented in the Mysteries, that of regenerated man, the mortal, who, by crucifying the man of fleshand his passions on the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 562 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Procrustean bed of torture, became reborn as an Immortal. Leaving the body, the animal-man, behind him, tied on theCross of Initiation like an empty chrysalis, the Ego Soul became as free as a butterfly. Still later, owing to the gradual lossof spirituality, the cross became in Cosmogony and Anthropology no higher than a phallic symbol.With the Esotericists, from the remotest times the Universal Soul or anima mundi, the material reflection of the ImmaterialIdeal, was the Source of Life of all beings and of the life principle of the three kingdoms; and it was Septenary with theHermetic philosophers, as with all ancients. For it is represented as a Sevenfold cross, whose branches are respectively,light, heat, electricity, terrestrial magnetism, astral radiation, motion, and Intelligence, or what some call self-consciousness.We have said it elsewhere. Long before the cross or its sign were adopted as symbols of Christianity, the sign of thecross was used as a sign of recognition among adepts and neophytes, the latter being called Chrests (from Chrestos,man of tribulation and sorrow). Says E. Levi: \"The sign of the cross adopted by the Christians does not belong exclusivelyto them. It is Kabalistic, and represents the opposition and quaternary equilibrium of the elements. We see by the Occultverse of the Paternoster that there were originally two ways of making it, or, at least two very different formulas to expressits meaning -- one reserved for priests-initiates, the other given to neophites and the profane. Thus, for example, theinitiate, carrying his hand to his forehead, said: To thee; then he added, belong: and continued, while carrying his hand tothe breast -- the kingdom; then, to the left shoulder -- justice: to the right shoulder -- and mercy. Then he joined the twohands, adding: throughout the generating cycles: 'Tibi sunt Malchut et Geburah et Chassed per Aeonas' -- a sign of theCross, absolutely and magnificently kabalistic, which the profanations of Gnosticism made the militant and official Churchcompletely lose.\" (Dogma et Ritual, etc., Vol. II., p. 88.)The \"militant and official Church\" did more: having helped herself to what had never belonged to her, she took only thatwhich the \"profane\" had, the Kabalistic meaning of the male and female Sephiroth. She never lost the inner and highermeaning since she never had it -- E. Levi's pandering to Rome, notwithstanding. The sign of the cross adopted by theLatin Church was phallic from the beginning, while that of the Greeks was the cross of the neophytes, the CHREST.------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 563 THE SEVEN THUNDERS.§ XXIII.THE UPANISHADS IN GNOSTIC LITERATURE.We are reminded in King's \"Gnostics\" that the Greek language has but one word for vowel and voice; and this has led theuninitiated to many erroneous interpretations. On the simple knowledge, however, of that well-known fact a comparisonmay be attempted, and a flood of light thrown upon several mystic meanings. Thus the words, so often used in theUpanishads and the Puranas, \"Sound\" and \"Speech,\" may be collated with the Gnostic \"Vowels\" and the \"Voices\" of theThunders and Angels in \"Revelation.\" The same will be found in Pistis Sophia, and other ancient Fragments and MSS.This was remarked even by the matter-of-fact author of \"The Gnostics and their Remains.\"Through Hippolytus, an early Church Father, we learn what Marcus -- a Pythagorean rather than a Christian Gnostic, anda Kabalist most certainly -- had received in mystic revelation. It is said that \"Marcus had it revealed unto him that 'theseven heavens'* . . . . sounded each one vowel, which, all combined together, formed a complete doxology\"; in clearerwords: \"the Sound whereof being carried down (from these seven heavens) to earth, became the creator and parent of allthings that be on earth.\" (See \"Hippolytus,\" vi., 48, and King's Gnostics, p. 200.) Translated from the Occult phraseologyinto still plainer language this would read: \"The Sevenfold LOGOS having differentiated into seven Logoi, or creativepotencies (vowels) these (the second logos, or \"Sound\") created all on Earth.Assuredly one who is acquainted with Gnostic literature can hardly help seeing in St. John's Apocalypse, a work of thesame school of thought. For we find John saying (chap. x. 3, 4), \"Seven thunders uttered their voices . . . and I was aboutto write . . . (but) I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, 'Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered,and write them not.' \" The same injunction is given to Marcus, the same to all other semi and full Initiates. Yet thesameness of equivalent expressions used, and of the underlying ideas, always betrays a portion of the mysteries. Wemust always seek for more than one meaning in every mystery allegorically revealed, especially in those in which thenumber seven and its multiplication seven by seven, or forty-nine, appear. Now when the Rabbi Jesus is requested (inPistis[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The \"Heavens\" are identical with \"Angels,\" as already stated.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 564 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Sophia) by his disciples to reveal to them, \"the mysteries of the Light of thy (his) Father\" (i.e., of the higher SELFenlightened by Initiation and Divine knowledge), Jesus answers: \"Do ye seek after these mysteries? No mystery is moreexcellent than they which shall bring your souls unto the Light of Lights, unto the place of Truth and Goodness, unto theplace where there is neither male nor female, neither form in that place but Light, everlasting, not to be uttered.

Thus these Seven vowels with their forty-nine powers are identical with the threeand the Seven Fires of the Hindus and their forty-nine fires; identical with the numerical mysteries of the Persian Simorgh;identical with those of the Jewish Kabalists. The latter, dwarfing the numbers (their mode of blinds), made the duration ofeach successive renewal (what we call in esoteric parlance Round) of the seven renewals of the globe only of 7,000years, instead of, as is more likely, 7,000,000,000, and assigned to the total duration of the universe 49,000 years only.(Compare § \"Chronology of the Brahmins.\")Now, the Secret Doctrine furnishes a key which reveals to us on indisputable grounds of comparative analogy thatGaruda, the allegorical and monstrous half-man and half-bird, -- the Vahan or vehicle on which Vishnu (who is Kala,\"time\") is shown to ride -- is the origin of all other such allegories. He is the Indian phoenix, the emblem of cyclic andperiodical time, the \"man-lion\" Singha, of whose representations the so-called \"gnostic gems\" are so full.* \"Over theseven rays of the lion's crown, and corresponding to their points, stand, in many cases, the seven vowels of the Greekalphabet [Gk char], testifying to the Seven Heavens.\" This is the Solar lion and the emblem of the Solar cycle, as[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* As confessed by King, the great authority on Gnostic antiquities, these gnostic gems are not the work of the Gnostics,but belong to pre-christian periods, and are the work of magicians (p. 241).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 565 WHEN TIME BE NO LONGER.Garuda* is that of the great cycle, the \"Maha-Kalpa\" co-eternal with Vishnu, and also, of course, the emblem of the Sun,and Solar cycle. This is shown by the details of the allegory. At his birth, Garuda is mistaken for Agni, the God of Fire, onaccount of his (Garuda's) \"dazzling splendour,\" and called thereupon Gaganeswara, \"lord of the sky.\" Again, his beingrepresented as Osiris, and by many heads of allegorical monsters on the Abraxas (gnostic) gems, with the head and beakof an eagle or a hawk (solar birds), denotes Garuda's solar and cyclic character. His Son is Jatabu, the cycle of 60,000years. As well remarked by C. W. King:-- \"Whatever the primary meaning (of the gem with the solar lion and vowels) itwas probably imported in its present shape from INDIA, that true fountain head of gnostic iconography\" (Gnostics, p.218).The mysteries of the seven gnostic vowels, uttered by the thunders of St. John, can be unriddled only by the primeval andoriginal Occultism of Aryavarta, brought into India by the primeval Brahmins, who had been initiated in Central Asia. Andthis is the Occultism we study and try to explain, as much as is possible in these pages. Our doctrine of seven Races andSeven Rounds of life and evolution around our terrestrial chain of spheres, may be found even in Revelation.** When theseven \"thunders,\" or \"sounds,\" or \"vowels\" -- one meaning out of the seven for each such vowel relating directly to ourown Earth and its seven Root-Races in each Round -- \"had uttered their voices\" -- but forbidden the Seer to write them,and made him \"seal up those things\" -- what did the Angel \"standing upon the sea and upon the earth\" do? He lifted hishand to heaven \"and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever . . . . that there should be time no longer.\" \"But in the daysof the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound, the Mystery of God (of the Cycle) should be finished\" (x.7), which means, in theosophic phraseology, that when the Seventh Round is completed, then Time will cease. \"Thereshall be time no longer\" very naturally, since pralaya shall set in and there will remain no one on earth to keep a divisionof time, during that periodical dissolution and arrest of conscious life.Dr. Kenealy and others believed this doctrine of the Rabbins (their calculations of cyclic seven and forty-nine) to havebeen brought by[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The lack of intuition in Orientalists and antiquarians past and present, is remarkable. Thus, Wilson, the translator ofVishnu Purana, declares in his Preface that in the Garuda Purana he found \"no account of the birth of Garuda.\"Considering that an account of \"Creation\" in general is given therein, and that Garuda is co-eternal with Vishnu, the MahaKalpa, or Great Life-CycIe, beginning with and ending with the manifesting Vishnu, what other account of Garuda's birthcould be expected !** Vide Revelation xvii., verses 2 and 10; and Leviticus xxiii., verses 15 to 18; the first passage speaking of the \"SevenKings,\" of whom five have gone; and the second about the \"Seven Sabbaths,\" etc.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 566 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.them from Chaldea. This is more than likely. But the Babylonians, who had all those cycles and taught them only at theirgreat initiatory mysteries of astrological magic, got their wisdom and learning from India. It is not difficult, therefore, torecognize in them our own esoteric doctrine. In their secret computations, the Japanese have the same figures in theircycles. As to the Brahmins, their Puranas and Upanishads are a good proof of it. The latter have passed entirely intoGnostic literature; and a Brahmin needs only to read Pistis Sophia* to recognize his forefathers' property, even to thephraseology and similes used. Compare: in Pistis Sophia the disciple says to Jesus: \"Rabbi, reveal unto us the Mysteriesof the Light (i.e., the \"Fire of Knowledge or Enlightenment\") . . . forasmuch as we have heard thee saying that there isanother baptism of smoke, and another baptism of the Spirit of Holy Light,\" i.e., the Spirit of FIRE. \"I baptize you with"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"water, but . . . . he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire,\" says John of Jesus (Matt. iii. 2); meaning thisesoterically. The real significance of this statement is very profound. It means that he, John, a non-initiated ascetic, canimpart to his disciples no greater wisdom than the mysteries connected with the plane of matter (water being a symbol ofit). His gnosis was that of exoteric and ritualistic dogma, of dead-letter orthodoxy; ** while the wisdom which Jesus, anInitiate of the higher mysteries, would reveal to them, was of a higher character, for it was the \"FIRE\" Wisdom of the truegnosis or the real spiritual enlightment. One was FIRE, the other the SMOKE. For Moses, the fire on Mount Sinai, and thespiritual wisdom imparted; for the multitudes of the \"people\" below, for the profane, Mount Sinai in (through) smoke, i.e.,the exoteric husks of orthodox or sectarian ritualism.Now, having the above in view, read the dialogue between the sages Narada and Davamata in the Anugita, the antiquityand importance of which MS. (an episode from the Mahabharata) one can learn in the \"Sacred Books of the East,\" editedby Prof. Max Muller.** Narada is discussing upon the breaths or the \"life-winds,\" as they are called in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Pistis Sophia is an extremely important document, a genuine Evangel of the Gnostics, ascribed at random to Valentinus,but much more probably a pre-Christian work in its original. It was discovered in a Coptic MS. by Schwartze, in the BritishMuseum, quite accidentally, and translated by him into Latin; after which text and (Latin) version were published byPetermann in the year 1853. In the text itself the authorship of this Book is ascribed to Philip the Apostle, whom Jesusbids to sit down and write the revelation. It is genuine and ought to be as canonical as any other gospel. Unfortunately itremains to this day untranslated.** In the Cycle of Initiation, which was very long, water represented the first and lower steps toward purification, whiletrials connected with fire came last. Water could regenerate the body of matter; FIRE alone, that of the inner Spiritualman.*** See Introduction by Kashinath Trimbak Telang, M.A.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 567 TRUTH BETWEEN TWO CONTRASTS.the clumsy translations of such words as Prana, Apana, etc., whose full esoteric meaning and application to individualfunctions can hardly be rendered in English. He says of this Science that \"it is the teaching of the Veda that the fire verilyis all the deities, and knowledge of it arises among Brahmans, being accompanied by intelligence.\" By \"fire,\" says theCommentator, he means the SELF. By \"intelligence,\" the Occultist says, Narada means neither \"discussion\" nor\"argumentation,\" as Aruna Misra believes, but \"intelligence\" truly, or the adaptation of the fire of Wisdom to ExotericRitualism for the profane. This is the chief concern of the Brahmans (who were the first to set the example to othernations who thus anthropomorphized and carnalized the grandest metaphysical truths). Narada makes it plain and ismade to say: \"The smoke of that fire, which is of excellent glory, appears in the shape of darkness\" (verily so!); \"its ashes(are) passion; and goodness is that in connection with it in which the offering is thrown\": i.e., that faculty in the disciplewhich apprehends the subtle truth (the flame) which escapes heavenward, while the objective sacrifice remains as aproof and evidence of piety only to the profane. For what can Narada mean in teaching that \"those who understand thesacrifice understand the Samana and the Vyana as the principal (offering)\"; and \"the Prana and Apana, but portions ofthe offering . . . and between them is the fire . . . . that is the excellent seat of the Udana as understood by Brahmanas.As to that which is distinct from these pairs, hear me speak about that. Day and night are a pair, between them is the fire.. . That which exists and that which does not exist are a pair, between them is the fire, etc.,\" and after every such contrastNarada adds \"That is the excellent seat of the Udana as understood by Brahmanas.\"Now many people do not know the full meaning of such terms as Samana and Vyana, Prana and Apana, explained asbeing \"life-winds\" (we say \"principles and their respective faculties and senses\"), being offered up to Udana, the soi-disant principal \"life wind,\" (?) said to act at all the joints. Therefore the reader, who is ignorant that the word \"fire\" meansin these allegories both the \"Self\" and the higher divine knowledge, will understand nothing in this; and will thereforeentirely miss the point of our argument, as its translators and even its editor the great Oxford Sanskritist, Max Muller, hasmissed the true meaning of Narada's words. Exoterically, all this enumeration of \"life winds\" means, of course,approximately, that which is surmised in the foot-notes; namely, \"The sense appears to be this . . . . worldly life is due tothe operations of the life-winds which are attached to the SELF, and lead to its manifestations as individual souls (?). Ofthese the Samana and Vyana are controlled and held under check by------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 568 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Prana and Apana. . . . The latter two are held in check and controlled by the Udana, which thus controls all. And thecontrol of this, which is the control of all five . . . . leads to the Supreme Self\" (p. 259, Anugita, \"Sacred Books of the East,\"Vol. VIII.)The above is given as an explanation of the text, which records the words of the Brahmana, who narrates how hereached the ultimate Wisdom of Yogism, and had reached all knowledge in this wise. Saying that he had \"perceived bymeans of the SELF the seat abiding in the SELF,\" where dwells the Brahman free from all; and explaining that thatindestructible principle was entirely beyond the perception of senses (i.e., of the five \"life-winds\"), he adds that \"in themidst of an these (life-winds) which move about in the body and swallow up one another, blazes the Vaisvanara firesevenfold.\" This \"Fire,\" according to Nilakantha's Commentary, is identical with the \"I,\" the SELF, which is the goal of theascetic (Vaisvanara being a word often used for the Self). Then the Brahmana goes on to enumerate that which is meantby the word \"Sevenfold,\" and says, \"The nose (or smell), the tongue (taste), the eye, and the skin, and the ear as the fifth,the mind, and the understanding, these are the seven tongues of the blaze of Vaisvanara,*. . . . . those are the seven(kinds of) fuel for me,**. . . . . these are the seven great officiating priests.\"These seven priests are accepted by Arjuna Misra in the sense of meaning \"the soul distinguished as so many (souls, orprinciples) with reference to these several powers\"; and, finally, the translator seems to accept the explanation, and"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"reluctantly admits that \"they may mean\" this; though he himself takes the sense to mean \"the powers of hearing, etc. (thephysical senses, in short) which are presided over by the several deities.\" (Vide loc. cit., p. 259, f.n. 6.)But whatever it may mean, whether in scientific or orthodox interpretations, this passage on page 259 explains Narada'sstatements on page 276, and shows them referring to exoteric and esoteric methods and contrasting them. Thus theSamana and the Vyana, though subject to the Prana and the Apana, and all the four to Udana in the matter of acquiringthe Pranayama (of the Hatha-Yogi, chiefly, or the \"lower\" form of the Yoga) are yet referred to as the principal offering,for, as rightly argued by the commentator, their \"operations are more practically important for vitality\"; i.e., they are thegrossest, and are offered in the sacrifice, to disappear, so to speak, in the quality of darkness of that fire or its SMOKE(mere exoteric ritualistic form). But[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the astronomical and cosmical key, Vaisvanara is Agni, son of the Sun, or Viswanaras, but in the psycho-metaphysical symbolism it is the SELF, in the sense of non-separateness, i.e., both divine and human.** Here the speaker personifies the said divine SELF.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 569 THE DIVINE SELF'S WISDOM.Prana and Apana, though shown as subordinate (because less gross or more purified), have the FIRE between them: theSelf and the secret knowledge possessed by that Self. So for the good and evil, and for \"that which exists and that whichdoes not exist\"; all these \"pairs\"* have fire between them, i.e., esoteric knowledge, the Wisdom of the divine SELF. Letthose who are satisfied with the Smoke of the FIRE remain wherein they are, that is to say within the Egyptian darknessof theological fictions and dead-letter interpretations.The above is written only for the Western students of Occultism and Theosophy. The writer presumes to explain thesethings neither to the Hindus, who have their own Gurus; nor to the Orientalists, who think they know more than all theGurus and Rishis, past and present, put together. These rather lengthy quotations and examples cited are necessary, ifeven to point out to the student the works he has to study so as to derive benefit and learning from comparison. Let himread Pistis Sophia in the light of the Bhagavatgita, the Anugita and others; and then the statement made by Jesus in theGnostic Gospel will become clear, and the dead letter blinds disappear at once. Read this and compare with theexplanation from the Hindu scriptures just given. . . . \"And no name is more excellent than all these (seven) vowels.

As the \"pairs of opposites,\" male and female, are all derived from Akasa(undeveloped and developed, differentiated and undifferentiated, or SELF or Prajapati), so are the Valentinian \"pairs\" ofmale and female AEons shown to emanate from Bythos, the pre-existing eternal Depth, and in their secondary emanationfrom Ampsiu-Ouraan (or sempiternal Depth and Silence), the second Logos. In the esoteric emanation there are sevenchief \"pairs of opposites\"; and so also in the Valentinian system there were fourteen, or twice seven. Epiphanius, copyingincorrectly, \"copied one pair twice over,\" Mr. C. W. King thinks, \"and thus adds one pair to the proper fifteen.\" (\"TheGnostics,\" etc., pp. 263-4.) Here King falls into the opposite error: the pairs of AEons are not 15 (a blind) but 14, as thefirst AEon is that from which others emanate, Depth and Silence being the first and only emanation from Bythos. AsHippolytus shows: \"The AEons of Valentinus are confessedly the Six Radicals of Simon (Magus),\" with the seventh, Fire,at their head. And these are: Mind, Intelligence, Voice, Name, Reason and Thought subordinate to FIRE, the higher self,or precisely the \"Seven Winds\" or the \"Seven Priests\" of Anugita.** Not necessarily at death only, but during Samadhi or mystic trance.*** All the words and sentences between parenthetical marks, are the writer's.

Again, Garuda's son** -- Garuda being himself the Maha-Kalpaor great cycle -- Jatayu, the king of the feathered tribe, when on the point of being slain by Ravana who carries off Sita --says, speaking of himself:\"It is 60,000 years O King, that I am born,\" after which turning his back on the Sun -- he dies.Jatayu is, of course, the cycle of 60,000 years within the great cycle of GARUDA; hence he is represented as his son, ornephew, ad libitum,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Barbelo is one of the three \"Invisible Gods,\" and, as C.

But all this is externalallegory.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 571 THE ANTIQUITY OF THE KAPILAS.since the whole meaning rests in his being placed on the line of Garuda's descendants. Then, again, there is Diti -- theMother of the Maruts -- whose descendants and progeny belonged to the posterity of Hiranyaksha, \"whose number was77 crores (or 770 millions) of men.\" (See Padma Purana.) All such narratives are pronounced meaningless fictions andabsurdities. But -- Truth is the daughter of Time, verily; and time will show.Meanwhile, what could be easier than an attempt, at least, to verify Puranic chronology? There are many Kapilas; but theKapila who slew King Sagara's progeny -- 60,000 men strong -- was undeniably Kapila, the founder of the Sankhyaphilosophy, since it is so stated in the Puranas; although one of them flatly denies the imputation without explaining itsesoteric meaning. It is the Bhagavata Purana (IX. viii., 12 and 13), which says that \"the report that the sons of the Kingwere reduced to ashes by the mere glance of the sage is not true.\" \"For,\" as it argues, \"how can the quality of darkness,the product of anger, exist in a sage whose goodness was the essence that purified the world -- the earth's dust, as itwere, attributed to Heavens! How should mental perturbation distract that sage, identified with the Supreme Spirit, andwho has steered here (on earth) that solid vessel of the Sankhya (philosophy), with the help of which he who desires toobtain liberation crosses the dreaded ocean of existence, that path to death?\"The Purana is in duty bound to speak as it does. It has a dogma to promulgate and a policy to carry out -- that of greatsecrecy with regard to mystical divine truths divulged for countless ages only at initiation. It is not in the Puranas,therefore, that we have to look for an explanation of the mystery connected with various transcendental states of being.That the story is an allegory is seen upon its very face: the 60,000 Sons, brutal, vicious, and impious, are thepersonification of the human passions that a \"mere glance of the sage\" -- the SELF who represents the highest state ofpurity that can be reached on earthreduces to ashes. But it has also other significations -- cyclic and chronologicalmeanings, -- a method of marking the periods when certain sages flourished, found also in other Puranas.Now it is as well ascertained as any tradition can be, that it was at Hardwar (or Gangadwara, the \"door or gate of theGanges\") at the foot of the Himalayas, that Kapila sat in meditation for a number of years. Not far from the Sewalik range,the \"pass of Hardwar\" is called to this day \"Kapila's Pass\"; and the place, \"Kapilasthen,\" by the ascetics. It is there thatGanga (Ganges) emerging from its mountainous gorge, begins its course over the sultry plains of India. And it is asclearly ascertained by geological survey that the tradition which claims that the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 572 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.ocean ages ago washed the base of the Himalayas -- is not entirely without foundation, for there are traces left of this.The Sankhya philosophy may have been brought down and taught by the first, and written out by the last Kapila.Now Sagara is the name of the Ocean, and even of the Bay of Bengal, at the mouth of the Ganges, to this day in India(Vide Wilson's Vishnu Purana, Vol. III. p. 309). Have geologists ever calculated the number of millenniums it has takenthe sea to recede to where it is now, from Hardwar, 1,024 feet above the level of the sea at present? If they did, thoseOrientalists who show Kapila flourishing from the 1st to the 9th cent. A.D., might change their opinions, if only for one oftwo very good reasons: the true number of years elapsed since Kapila's day is in the Puranas unmistakably, though thetranslators fail to see it. And secondly -- the Kapila of the Satya, and the Kapila of the Kali-Yugas may be one and thesame INDIVIDUALITY, without being the same PERSONALITY.Kapila, besides being the name of a personage, of the once living Sage and the author of Sankhya philosophy, is also thegeneric name of the Kumaras, the celestial ascetics and virgins; therefore the very fact of Bhagavata Purana calling thatKapila -- which it showed just before as a portion of Vishnu -- the author of Sankhya philosophy, ought to have warnedthe reader of a blind containing an esoteric meaning. Whether the Son of Vitatha, as Harivansa shows him to be, or ofanyone else, the author of Sankhya cannot be the same as the Sage of the SatyaYuga -- at the very beginning of theManvantara, when Vishnu is shown in the form of Kapila, \"imparting to all creatures true Wisdom\"; for this relates to thatprimordial period when \"the Sons of God\" taught to the just created men the arts and sciences, which have beencultivated and preserved since then in the sanctuaries by the Initiates. There are several well-known Kapilas in thePuranas. First the primeval sage, then Kapila, one of the three \"Secret\" Kumaras; and Kapila, son of Kasyapa and Kadru-- the \"many-headed Serpent,\" (See Vayu Purana placing him on the list of the forty renowned sons of Kasyapa), besides"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Kapila, the great sage and philosopher of the Kali Yuga.

It could be, and was at first so used and applied to theMacrocosm, after which it descended to the Microcosm, or Man. There was, then, the purely intellectual andmetaphysical, or the \"inner Science,\" and the as purely materialistic or \"surface science,\" both of which could beexpounded by and contained in the Decade. It could be studied, in short, from the Universals of Plato, and the inductivemethod of Aristotle. The former started from a divine comprehension, when the plurality proceeded from unity, or thedigits of the decade appeared, but to be finally re-absorbed, lost in the infinite Circle. The latter depended on sensuousperception alone, when the Decade could be regarded either as the unity that multiplies, or matter which differentiates, itsstudy being limited to the plane surface; to the Cross, or the Seven which proceeds from the ten -- or the perfect number,on Earth as in heaven.This dual system was brought, together with the Decade, by Pythagoras from India. That it was that of the Brachmansand Iranians, as they are called by the ancient Greek philosophers, is warranted to us by the whole range of Sanskritliterature, such as the Puranas and the laws of Manu. In these \"Laws\" or \"Ordinances of Manu,\" it is said that Brahma firstcreates \"the ten lords of Being,\" the ten Prajapati or creative Forces; which ten produce \"seven\" other Manus, or, rather,as some MSS. have it, Munin, instead of Manun = \"devotees,\" or holy Beings, which are the Seven Angels of thePresence in the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 574 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Western religion. This mysterious number Seven, born from the upper triangle [[diagram]], the latter itself born from theapex thereof, or the Silent Depths of the unknown universal soul (Sige and Bythos), is the sevenfold Saptaparna plant,born and manifested on the surface of the soil of mystery, from the threefold root buried deep under that impenetrablesoil. This idea is fully elaborated in Vol. I. § \"Primordial Substance and Divine Thought,\" which the reader has to noticecarefully, if he would grasp the metaphysical idea involved in the above symbol. In man as in nature, it is, according to thecis-Himalayan esoteric philosophy (which is that of the original Manu Cosmogony), the septenary division that is intendedby Nature herself. The seventh principle (purusha) alone is the divine SELF, strictly speaking; for, as said in Manu, \"He(Brahma) having pervaded the subtile parts of those six of unmeasured brightness,\" created or called them forth to \"Self\"-consciousness or the consciousness of that One SELF (V. 16, ch. i. Manu). Of these six, five elements (or principles, orTattva, as Medhatithi, the commentator thinks) \"are called the atomic destructible elements\" (v. 27); they are described inthe above-named section.We have now to speak of the Mystery language, that of the prehistoric races. It is not a phonetic, but a purely pictorialand symbolical tongue. It is known at present in its fulness to the very few, having become with the masses for more than5,000 years an absolutely dead language. Yet most of the learned Gnostics, Greeks and Jews, knew it, and used it,though very differently. A few instances may be given.On the plane above, the Number is no Number but a nought -- a CIRCLE. On the plane below, it becomes one -- which isan odd number. Each letter of the ancient alphabets having had its philosophical meaning and raison d'etre, the number Isignified with the Alexandrian Initiates a body erect, a living standing man, he being the only animal that has this privilege.And, by adding to the I a head, it was transformed into a P, a symbol of paternity, of the creative potency; while Rsignified a \"moving man,\" one on his way. Hence PATER ZEUS had nothing sexual or phallic either in its sound or form ofletters; nor had [[pater Deus]] (vide Ragon). If we turn now to the Hebrew Alphabet, we shall find that while I or aleph,[[hebrew]], has a bull or an Ox for its symbol, 10, the perfect number, or One of the Kabala is a Yodh [[hebrew]] (y, i, or j);and means, as the first letter of Jehovah, the procreative organ, et seq.The odd numbers are divine, the even numbers are terrestrial, devilish, and unlucky. The Pythagoreans hated the binary.With them it was the origin of differentiation, hence of contrasts, discord, or matter, the beginning of evil. In theValentinian theogony, Bythos and Sige (Depth, Chaos, matter born in Silence) are the primordial binary.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 575 THE THREE SCIENCES.With the early Pythagoreans, however, the duad was that imperfect state into which the first manifested being fell when itgot detached from the Monad. It was the point from which the two roads -- the Good and the Evil -- bifurcated. All thatwhich was double-faced or false was called by them \"binary.\" ONE was alone Good, and Harmony, because no"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"disharmony can proceed from one alone. Hence the Latin word Solus in relation to one and only God, the Unknown ofPaul. Solus, however, very soon became Sol -- the Sun.The ternary is thus the first of the odd numbers, as the triangle is the first of the geometrical figures. This number is trulythe number of mystery par excellence. To study it on the exoteric lines one has to read Ragon's Cours Interpretatif desInitiations; on the esoteric -- the Hindu symbolism of numerals; as the combinations which were applied to it arenumberless. It is on the occult properties of the three equal lines or sides of the Triangle that Ragon based his studiesand founded the famous masonic society of the Trinosophists (those who study three sciences; an improvement upon theordinary three masonic degrees, given to those who study nothing except eating and drinking at the meetings of theirlodges). \"The first line of the triangle offered to the apprentice for study,\" writes the founder, -- \"is the mineral kingdom,symbolized by Tubalc . . . (Tubal-cain). The second side on which the 'companion' has to meditate, is the vegetablekingdom, symbolized by Schibb [[diagram]] (Schibboleth). In this kingdom begins the generation of the bodies. This iswhy the letter G is presented radiant before the eyes of the adept (? !). The third side is left to the master mason, who hasto complete his education by the study of the animal kingdom. It is symbolized by Maoben [[diagram]] (Sun ofputrefaction)\" etc., etc.The first solid figure is the Quaternary, symbol of immortality. It is the pyramid: for the pyramid stands on a triangular,square, or polygonal base, and terminates with a point at the top, thus yielding the triad and the quaternary or the 3 and4. It is the Pythagoreans who taught the connection and relation between the gods and the numbers -- in a Science calledarithmomancy. The Soul is a number, they said, which moves of itself and contains the number 4; and spiritual andphysical man is number 3, as the ternary represented for them not only the surface but also the principle of the formationof the physical body. Thus animals were ternaries only, man alone being a septenary, when virtuous; a quinary when bad,for:--Number 5 was composed of a binary and a ternary, which binary threw everything in the perfect form into disorder andconfusion. The[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The reason for it is simple, and was given in \"Isis Unveiled.\" In geometry, one line fails to represent a perfect body orfigure, nor can two lines constitute a demonstratively perfect figure.

The latter is a compound of a binary directly relatingto gross matter, and of three Spirits:\"since 5 is the ingenious union of two Greek accents [[diagram]] placed over vowels which have or have not to beaspirated. The first sign [[diagram]] is called 'Strong Spirit' or superior Spirit, the spirit of God aspired (spiratus) andbreathed by man. The second sign [[diagram]] the lower, is the Spirit of Love, representing the secondary Spirit; the thirdembraces the whole man. It is the universal Quintessence, the vital fluid or Life.\" (Ragon.)The more mystic meaning of 5 is given in an excellent article by Mr. Subba Row, in \"Five Years of Theosophy\" (pp. 110,et seq.) -- \"The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac,\" in which he gives some rules that may help the inquirer to ferret out \"thedeep significance of ancient Sanskrit nomenclature in the old Aryan myths and allegories.\" Meanwhile, let us see whathas been hitherto stated about the constellation Capricornus in theosophical publications, and what is known of itgenerally. Every one knows that [[diagram]] is the tenth sign of the Zodiac into which the Sun enters at the winter solstice,about December 21st. But very few are those who know -- even in India, unless they are initiated -- the real mysticconnection which seems to exist, as we are told, between the names Makara and Kumara. The first means someamphibious animal called flippantly 'crocodile,' as some Orientalists think, and the second is the title of the great patronsof Yogins (See \"Saiva Puranas,\") the Sons of, and even one with, Rudra (Siva); a Kumara himself. It is through theirconnection with Man that the Kumaras are likewise connected with the Zodiac. Let us try to find out what the wordMakara means.The word Makara, says the author of \"The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac,\" \"contains within itself the clue to its correctinterpretation. The letter Ma is equivalent to No. 5, and Kara means hand. Now in Sanskrit Thribhujam means a triangle,bhujam or Karam (both synonyms) being understood to mean a side. So Makaram or Panchakaram means a Pentagon\" -- the five-pointed star or pentagon representing the five limbs of man.* Under the old system, we are told, Makara was theeighth instead of the tenth sign.** It is \"intended to represent the faces of the Universe, and indicates that the Universe isbounded by Pentagons,\" as the Sanskrit writers \"speak also of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* What is the meaning and the reason of this figure? Because, Manas is the fifth principle, and because the pentagon isthe symbol of Man -- not only of the five-limbed, but rather of the thinking, conscious MAN.** The reason for it becomes apparent when Egyptian symbology is studied. See further on.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 577 POSEION'S FIVE MINISTERS.Ashtadisa or eight faces bounding Space,\" referring thus to the loka-palas, the eight points of the compass (the fourcardinal and the four intermediate points) . . . \"From an objective point of view the Microcosm is represented by thehuman body. Makaram may be taken to represent simultaneously both the microcosm and the macrocosm, as externalobjects of perception.\" (pp. 113, 115)."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"But the true esoteric sense of the word \"Makara,\" does not mean \"crocodile,\" in truth, at all, even when it is comparedwith the animal depicted on the Hindu Zodiac. For it has the head and the fore-legs of an antelope and the body and tailof a fish. Hence the tenth sign of the Zodiac has been taken variously to mean a shark, a dolphin, etc.; as it is the vahanof Varuna, the Ocean God, and is often called, for this reason, Jala-rupa or \"water-form.\" The dolphin was the vehicle ofPoseidon-Neptune with the Greeks, and one with him, esoterically; and this \"dolphin\" is the \"sea-dragon\" as much as theCrocodile of the Sacred Nile is the vehicle of Horus, and Horus himself. \"I am the fish and seat of the great Horus of Kem-our,\" says the mummy-form God with the crocodile's head (ch. lxxxviii., 2, \"Book of the Dead\"). With the Peratae Gnosticsit is Chozzar (Neptune), who converts into a sphere the dodecagonal pyramid, \"and paints its gate with many colours.\" Hehas FIVE androgyne ministers -- he is Makara, the Leviathan.The rising Sun being considered the Soul of the Gods sent to manifest itself to men every day, and the crocodile risingout of the water at the first sunbeam, that animal came finally to personify a Solar-fire devotee in India, as it personifiedthat fire, or the highest soul with the Egyptians.In the Puranas, the number of the Kumaras changes according to the exigencies of the allegory. For occult purposes theirnumber is given in one place as seven, then as four, then as five. In the Kurma Purana it is said of them: \"These five(Kumara), O Brahman, were Yogins who acquired entire exemption from passion.\" Their very name shows theirconnection with the said constellation -- the Makara, and with some other Puranic characters connected with the Zodiacalsigns. This is done in order to veil what was one of the most suggestive glyphs of the primitive Temples. They are mixedup astronomically, physiologically, and mystically, in general, with a number of Puranic personages and events. Hardlyhinted at in the \"Vishnu,\" they figure in various dramas and events throughout all the other Puranas and sacred literature;so that the Orientalists, having to pick up the threads of connection hither and thither, have ended by proclaiming theKumaras \"due chiefly to the fancy of the Puranic writers.\" But --Ma, -- we are told by the author of the \"Twelve Signs of the Zodiac\" -- is Five; kara, a hand with its five fingers, as also afive-sided sign or------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 578 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.a pentagon. The Kumara (in this case an anagram for occult purposes) are five in esotericism, as Yogis -- because thelast two names have ever been kept secret; they are the fifth order of Brahmadevas, and the fivefold Chohans, having thesoul of the five elements in them, Water and Ether predominating, and therefore their symbols were both aquatic andfiery. \"Wisdom lies concealed under the couch of him who rests on the golden lotos (padma) floating on the water.\" InIndia it is Vishnu (one of whose avatars was Budha, as claimed in days of old). The Prachetasas, the worshippers ofNarayana (who, like Poseidon moved or dwelt over not under the waters), plunged into the depths of the ocean for theirdevotions and remained therein 10,000 years; and the Prachetasas are ten exoterically, but five, esoterically. \"Prachetas\"is in Sanskrit, the name of Varuna, the water god, Nereus, an aspect of the same as Neptune, the Prachetasas beingthus identical with the \"five ministers\" of [[CHOZZAR]] (Poseidon) of the Peratae Gnostics. These are respectively called[[AOT, AOAI, OTO, OTOB]], \"the fifth, a triple name (making Seven) being lost\"* -- i.e., kept secret. This much for the\"aquatic\" symbol; the \"fiery\" connecting them with the fiery symbol -- spiritually. For purposes of identity, let us rememberthat as the mother of the Prachetasas was Savarna, the daughter of the Ocean, so was Amphitrite the mother ofNeptune's mystic \"ministers.\"Now the reader is reminded that these \"five ministers\" are symbolized both in the Dolphin, who had overcome the chasteAmphitrite's unwillingness to wed Poseidon, and in Triton their son. The latter, whose body above the waist is that of aman and below a dolphin, a fish, is, again, most mysteriously connected with Oannes, the Babylonian Dag, and furtheralso with the (fish) Avatar of Vishnu, Matsya, both teaching mortals Wisdom. The Dolphin, as every mythologist knows,was placed for his service by Poseidon among the constellations, and became with the Greeks, Capricornus, the goat,whose hind part is that of a dolphin, thus shown identical with Makara, whose head is also that of an antelope and thebody and tail those of a fish. This is why the sign of the Makara was borne on the banner of Kama deva, the Hindu god oflove, identified, in Atharva Veda, with Agni (the fire-god), the son of Lakshmi, as correctly given by Harivansa. ForLakshmi and Venus are one, and Amphitrite is the early form of Venus. Now Kama (the Makara-ketu) is \"Aja\" (theunborn), and \"Atma-bhu\" (the self-existent), and Aja is the LOGOS in the Rig-Veda, as he is shown therein to be the firstmanifestation of the ONE: \"Desire first arose in IT, which was the primal[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* So is Brahma's fifth head, said to be lost, burnt to ashes by Siva's \"central eye\"; Siva being also panchanana \"fivefaced.\" Thus the number is preserved and secresy maintained on the true esoteric meaning.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 579 THE PUZZLES OF SYMBOLISM.germ of mind,\" that \"which connects entity with non-entity\" (or Manas, the fifth, with Atma, the seventh, esoterically) saythe Sages. This is the first stage. The second, on the following plane of manifestation, shows Brahma (whom we select asa representative for all the other first gods of the nations) as causing to issue from his body his mind-born sons,\"Sanandana and others,\" who, in the fifth \"creation,\" and again in the ninth (for purposes of blind) become the Kumara.Let us close by reminding the reader that goats were sacrificed to Amphitrite and the Nereids on the sea-shore, as goatsare sacrificed to this day to Durga Kali, who is only the black side of Lakshmi (Venus), the white side of Sakti; and bysuggesting what connection these animals may have with Capricornus, in which appear twenty-eight stars in the form of agoat, which goat was transformed by the Greeks into Amalthaea -- Jupiter's foster-mother. Pan, the god of Nature, hadgoat's feet, and changed himself into a goat at the approach of Typhon. But this is a mystery which the writer dares notdwell upon at length, not being sure of being understood. Thus the mystical side of the interpretation must be left to theintuition of the student. Let us note one more thing in relation to the mysterious number five. It symbolizes at one and thesame time the Spirit of life eternal and the Spirit of life and love terrestrial -- in the human compound; and, it includesdivine and infernal magic, and the universal and the individual quintessence of being. Thus, the five mystic words orvowels (vide infra) uttered by Brahma at \"creation,\" which forthwith became the Panchadasa (certain Vedic hymns,"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"attributed to that God) are in their creative and magical potentiality, the white side of the black Tantrik five \"makaras,\" orthe five m's. \"Makara,\" the constellation, is a seemingly meaningless and absurd name. Yet, even besides itsanagrammatical significance in conjunction with the term \"Kumara,\" the numerical value of its first syllable and its esotericresolution into five has a very great and occult meaning in the mysteries of nature.Suffice it to say, that as the sign of Makara is connected with the birth of the spiritual \"microcosm,\" and the death ordissolution of the physical Universe (its passage into the realm of the Spiritual)*; so the Dhyan Chohans, called in IndiaKumara, are connected with both. Moreover, in the exoteric religions, they have become the synonyms of the Angels ofDarkness. Mara is the God of Darkness, the Fallen One, and Death**; and yet it is one of the names of Kama, the firstgod in the Vedas, the Logos, from whom have sprung the Kumaras, and this[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"When the Sun passes away behind the 30th degree of Makara and will reach no more the sign of the Meenam (pisces)then the night of Brahma has come.\" . . .** Death of every physical thing truly; but Mara is also the unconscious quickener of the birth of the Spiritual.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 580 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.connects them still more with our \"fabulous\" Indian Makara, and the crocodile-headed God in Egypt.* The crocodiles inthe Celestial Nile are Five, and the God Toum, the primordial deity creating the heavenly bodies and the living beings,calls forth these crocodiles in his fifth creation. When Osiris, \"the defunct Sun,\" is buried and enters into Amenti, thesacred crocodiles plunge into the abyss of primordial Waters -- \"the great Green One.\" When the Sun of life rises, they re-emerge out of the sacred river. All this is highly symbolical, and shows how primeval esoteric truths found theirexpression in identical symbols. But, as Mr. T. Subba Row truly declares, \"The veil, that was dexterously thrown overcertain portions of the mystery connected with the (Zodiacal) signs by the ancient philosophers, will never be fully lifted upfor the amusement or edification of the uninitiated public.\"Nor was number five less sacred with the Greeks. The five words (Panchadasa) of Brahma have become with theGnostics the \"Five Words\" written upon the akasic (shining) garment of Jesus at his glorification: the words [[ZAMA ZAMAOZZA PAXAMA, OZAI]], translated by the Orientalists \"the robe, the glorious robe of my strength.\" These words were, intheir turn, the anagrammatic blind of the five mystic powers represented on the robe of the \"resurrected\" Initiate after hislast trial of three days' trance; the five becoming seven only after his death, when the Adept became the full CHRISTOS,the full KRISHNA-VISHNU, i.e., merged in Nirvana. The E Delphicum, a sacred symbol, was the numeral five, again; andhow sacred it was is shown by the fact that the Corinthians (according to Plutarch) replaced the wooden numeral in theDelphic Temple by a bronze one; and this one was transmuted by Livia Augusta into a fac-simile of gold.It is easy to recognize in the two spirits -- the Greek accents or signs ([[diagram]]) spoken of by Ragon (vide supra) --Atma and Buddhi, or \"divine spirit and its vehicle\" (spiritual soul).The six or the \"Senary\" is dealt with later, while the Septenary will be fully treated in the course of this volume. (Vide the\"Mysteries of the Hebdomad.\")The Ogdoad or 8 symbolizes the eternal and spiral motion of cycles, the 8, [[diagram]], and is symbolized in its turn by theCaduceus. It shows the regular breathing of the Kosmos presided over by the eight great gods -- the seven from theprimeval Mother, the One and the Triad.Then comes the number nine or the triple ternary. It is the number which reproduces itself incessantly under all shapesand figures in[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Osiris is called in the \"Book of the Dead\" \"Osiris, the double Crocodile.\" (See Chapter \"On the Names of Osiris,\" cxlii.)\"He is the good and the bad Principle; the Day, and the Night Sun, the God, and the mortal man.\" Thus far theMacrocosm and the Microcosm.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 581 THE MASTER MASON'S GRIP.every multiplication. It is the sign of every circumference, since its value in degrees is equal to 9, i.e., to 3 + 6 + 0. It is abad number under certain conditions, and very unlucky. If number 6 was the symbol of our globe ready to be animated bya divine spirit, 9 symbolized our earth informed by a bad or evil spirit.Ten, or the Decade, brings all these digits back to unity, and ends the Pythagorean table. Hence this figure -- [[diagram]],unity within zero -- was the symbol of Deity, of the Universe, and of man. Such is the secret meaning of \"the strong grip ofthe Lion's paw, of the tribe of Judah\" between two hands (the \"master mason's grip\"), the joint number of whose fingers isten.If we now give our attention to the Egyptian cross, or the Tau, we may discover this letter, so exalted by Egyptians,Greeks, and Jews, to be mysteriously connected with the Decade. The tau is the Alpha and the Omega of secret divineWisdom, which is symbolized by the initial and the final letter of Thot (Hermes). Thot was the inventor of the Egyptianalphabet, and the letter tau closed the alphabets of the Jews and the Samaritans, who called this character the \"end\" or\"perfection,\" \"culmination\" and \"security.\" Thence -- Ragon tells us -- the words terminus (end), and tectum (roof), aresymbols of shelter and security, which is rather a prosaic definition. But such is the usual destiny of ideas and things inthis world of spiritual decadence, if also of physical progress. PAN was at one time absolute nature, the one and GREAT-ALL; but when history catches a first glimpse of him, Pan has already tumbled down into a godling of the fields, a rural"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"god; and history will not recognize him, while theology makes of him the devil. Yet his seven-piped flute, the emblem ofthe seven forces of nature, of the seven planets, the seven musical notes, of all the septenary harmony, in short, showswell his primordial character. So with the Cross. Far earlier than the Jews had devised their golden candlestick of thetemple with three sockets on one side and four on the other, and made of number 7 a feminine number of generation,*thus introducing[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Reflecting on the Cross, the author of the \"Source of Measures\" shows that this candlestick in the temple \"was socomposed that counting on either side there were four candle-sockets; while at the apex, there being one in common toboth sides, there were in fact three to be counted on the one side and four on the other, making in all number 7 upon theself-same idea of one in common with the cross display. Take a line of one unit in breadth by three units long, and place iton an incline; take another of four units long, and lean it upon this one, from an opposite incline, making the top unit of thefour in length the corner or apex of a triangle. This is the display of the candlestick. Now take away the line of three unitsin length and cross it on the one of four units in length, and the cross form results. The same idea is conveyed in the sixdays of the week in Genesis, crowned by the seventh, which was used by itself as a base of circular measure\" (p. 51).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 582 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the phallic element into religion, the more spiritually-minded nations had made of the cross (as 3, 4 = 7), their mostsacred divine symbol. In fact, Circle, Cross, and Seven -- the latter being made a base of circular measurement -- are thefirst primordial symbols. Pythagoras, who brought his wisdom from India, left to posterity a glimpse into this truth. Hisschool regarded number 7 as a compound of numbers 3 and 4, which they explained in a dual manner. On the plane ofthe noumenal world, the triangle was, as the first conception of the manifested Deity, its image: \"Father-Mother-Son\"; andthe Quaternary, the perfect number, was the noumenal, ideal root of all numbers and things on the physical plane. Somestudents, in view of the sacredness of Tetraktis and the Tetragrammaton, mistake the mystic meaning of the Quaternary.The latter was with the ancients only a secondary \"perfection,\" so to speak, because it related only to the manifestedplanes. Whereas it is the Triangle, the Greek delta, [[diagram]], which was the \"vehicle of the unknown Deity.\" A goodproof of it lies with the name of the Deity beginning with Delta. Zeus was written [[Deus]], by the Boeotians,* thence theDeus of the Latins. This, in relation to the metaphysical conception, with regard to the meaning of the Septenary in thephenomenal world, but for purposes of profane or exoteric interpretation, the symbolism changed. Three became theideograph of the three material elements -- air, water, earth; and four became the principle of all that which is neithercorporeal nor perceptible. But this has never been accepted by the real Pythagoreans. Viewed as a compound of 6 and1, the senary and the unity, number seven was the invisible centre, the spirit of everything (see further the explanation of6), as there exists no body with six lines constituting its form without a seventh being found as the central point in it (seecrystals and snow-flakes in so-called inanimate nature). Moreover, number seven, they said, has all the perfection of theUNIT -- the number of numbers. For as absolute unity is uncreated, and impartite (hence number-less) and no numbercan produce it, so is the seven: no digit contained within the decade can beget or produce it. And it is 4, which affords anarithmetical division between unity and seven, as it surpasses the former by the same number (three), as it is itselfsurpassed by the seven, since four is by as many numbers above one, as seven is above four. (From a MS. supposed tobe by \"St. Germain.\")\"With the Egyptians number 7 was the symbol of life eternal,\" says Ragon, and adds that this is why the Greek letter Z,which is but a double 7 is the initial letter of Zao, \"I live,\" and of Zeus, \"the father of all living.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See Liddell's Greek-English Lexicon.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 583 THE MYSTERY OF THE NUMBER SIX.Moreover, figure 6 was the symbol of the Earth during the autumn and winter \"sleeping\" months, and figure 7 duringspring and summer, -- as the Spirit of life animated her at that time -- the seventh or central informing Force. We find thesame in the Egyptian mythos and symbol of Osiris and Isis, personifying Fire and Water metaphysically, and the Sun andthe Nile physically. The number of the Solar year, 365 in days, is the numerical value of the word Neilos (Nile). This,together with the Bull, with the Crescent and the ansated cross between its horns, and the Earth under its astronomicalsymbol -- [[diagram]] -- are the most phallic symbols of later antiquity.\"The Nile was the river of time with the number of a year, or year and a day (364 + 1 = 365). It represented the parturientwater of Isis, or Mother Earth, the moon, the woman, and the cow, also the workshop of Osiris, representing the T'sodOlaum of the Hebrews. The ancient name of this river was Eridanus, or the Hebrew Iardan, with the Coptic or old Greeksuffix. This was the door of the Hebrew word Jared, or 'Source,' or Descent . . . of the river Jordan, which had the samemythical use with the Hebrews that the Nile had with the Egyptians,* it was the source of descent, and held the waters oflife\" (Unpub. MS.) It was, to put it plainly, the symbol of the personified Earth, or Isis, regarded as the womb of that Earth.This is shown clearly enough; and Jordan -- the river so sacred now to Christians -- held no more sublime or poeticalmeaning in it than the parturient waters of the moon (Isis, or Jehovah in his female aspect). Now, as shown by the samescholar, Osiris was the sun, and the river Nile, and the tropical year of 365 days; while Isis was the moon, the bed of thatriver, or the mother earth \"for the parturient energies, of which water was a necessity,\" as also the lunar year of 354 days,\"the time-maker of the periods of gestation.\" All this then is sexual and phallic, and our modern scholars seem to find inthese symbols nothing beyond a physiological or phallic meaning. Nevertheless, the three figures 365, or the number ofdays in a solar year, have but to be read with the Pythagorean Key to find in them a highly philosophical and moralmeaning. One instance will be sufficient. It can read:The Earth -- animated by -- the Spirit of Life.3. 6. 5."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Simply because 3 is equivalent to the Greek gamma, or [[G]], which letter is the symbol of gaia (the Earth); while thefigure 6 is the symbol of the animating or informing principle, and the 5 is the universal quintessence which spreads inevery direction and forms all matter.

The system being of an extreme and complex difficulty, very few, evenamong the Initiates, could master all the seven keys. Is it to be wondered, then, that the metaphysical gradually dwindleddown into the physical nature; that the Sun, once upon a time the symbol of DEITY, became, as aeons glided by, that ofits creative ardour only; and that thence it fell into a glyph of phallic significance? But surely, it is not those whose methodwas (like Plato's) to proceed from the universals down to the particulars, who could ever have begun by symbolizing theirreligions by sexual emblems! It is quite true, though uttered by that incarnated paradox, Eliphas Levi, that \"man is God onEarth, and God is man in Heaven.\" But this could not, and never did apply to the One Deity, only to the Hosts of ITSincarnated beams, called by us Dhyan Chohans, by the ancients, Gods; and now transformed by the Church into devilson the left, and into the Saviour on the right side!But all such dogma grew out of the one root, the root of wisdom, which grows and thrives on the Indian soil. There is notan Archangel that could not be traced back to its prototype in the sacred land of Aryavarta. These \"prototypes\" are allconnected with the Kumaras who appear on the scene of action by refusing -- as Sanatkumara and Sananda -- to \"createprogeny.\" Yet they are called the \"creators\" of (thinking) man. More than once they are brought into connection withNarada -- another bundle of apparent incongruities, yet a wealth of philosophical tenets. Narada is the leader of theGandharvas, the celestial singers and musicians; esoterically, the reason for it is explained by the fact that the latter (theGandharvas) are \"the instructors of men in the secret sciences.\" It is they, who \"loving the women of the Earth,\" disclosedto them the mysteries of creation; or, as in the Veda -- the \"heavenly Gandharva\" is a deity who knew and revealed thesecrets of heaven and divine truths, in general. If we remember what is said of this class of Angels in Enoch and in theBible, then the allegory is plain: their leader, Narada, while refusing to procreate, leads men to become gods. Moreover,all of these, as stated in the Vedas, are Chhandaja (will-born) or incarnated (in different Manvantaras) of their own will; --and they are shown in exoteric literature as existing age after age; some being \"cursed to be re-born,\" others, incarnatingas a duty. Finally, as the Sanakadikas, the seven Kumaras who went to visit Vishnu on the \"White Island\" (Sveta-dwipa)the island inhabited by the Maha Yogins -- they are connected with Sakadwipa and the Lemurians and Atlanteans of theThird and Fourth Races.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 585 SEEMING CONTRADICTIONS.In Esoteric Philosophy, the Rudras (Kumaras, Adityas, Gandharvas, Asuras, etc.) are the highest Dhyan Chohans orDevas as regards intellectuality. They are those who, owing to their having acquired by self-development the five-foldnature -- hence the sacredness of number five -- became independent of the pure Arupa devas. This is a mystery verydifficult to realize and understand correctly. For, we see that those who were \"obedient to law\" are, equally with therebels, doomed to be reborn in every age. Narada, the Rishi, is cursed by Brahma to incessant peripateticism on Earth,i.e., to be constantly reborn. He is a rebel against Brahma, and yet has no worse fate than the Jayas -- the twelve greatcreative gods produced by Brahma as his assistants in the functions of creation. For the latter, lost in meditation, onlyforgot to create; and for this, they are equally cursed by Brahma to be born in every manvantara. And still they are termed-- together with the rebels -- Chhandajas, or those born of their own will in human form!All this is very puzzling to one who is unable to read and understand the Puranas except in their dead letter sense.*Hence we find the Orientalists refusing to be puzzled, and cutting the Gordian knot of perplexity by declaring the wholescheme \"figments\" \"of Brahminical fancy and love of exaggeration.\" But to the student of occultism, the whole is pregnantwith deeply philosophical meaning. We willingly leave the rind to the Western Sanskritist, but claim the essence of thefruit for ourselves. We do more: we concede that in one sense much in these so-called \"fables\" refers to astronomicalallegories about constellations, asterisms, stars, and planets. Yet, while the Gandharva of the Rig-Veda may there bemade to personify the fire of the Sun, the Gandharva devas are entities both of a physical and psychic character; whilethe Apsarasas (with other Rudras) are both qualities and quantities. In short, if ever unravelled, the theogony of the VedicGods will reveal fathomless mysteries of Creation and being. Truly says Parasara: \"These thirty-three divinities exist ageafter age, and their appearance and disappearance is in the same manner as the sun sets and rises again.\" (Book I., xv.)There was a time, when the Eastern symbol of the Cross and Circle, the Swastica, was universally adopted. With theesoteric (and, for the matter of that, exoteric) Buddhist, the Chinaman and the Mongolian, it means \"the 10,000 truths.\"These truths, they say, belong to the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Yet this sense, if once mastered, will turn out to be the secure casket which holds the keys to the Secret Wisdom.

It is found on the heart of the images and statues ofBuddha, in Tibet and Mongolia. It is the seal placed also on the hearts of the living Initiates, burnt into the flesh, for ever,with some. This, because they have to keep those truths inviolate and intact, in eternal silence and secrecy to the daythese are perceived and read by their chosen successors -- new Initiates -- \"worthy of being entrusted with the tenthousand perfections.\" So degraded, however, has it now become, that it is often placed on the headgear of the \"gods,\"the hideous idols of the sacrilegious Bhons, the Dugpas (Sorcerers) of the Tibetan borderlands; until found out by aGalukpa and torn off together with the head of the \"god;\" though it would be better were it that of the worshipper whichwas severed from the sinful body. Still, it can never lose its mysterious properties. Throw a retrospective glance, and seeit used alike by the Initiates and Seers, as by the priests of Troy (found by Schliemann on the site of that old city). Onefinds it with the old Peruvians, the Assyrians, Chaldeans, as well as on the walls of the old-world cyclopean buildings; inthe catacombs of the New world, and in those of the Old (?), at Rome, where, because the first Christians are supposedto have concealed themselves and their religion, it is called Crux Dissimulata.\"According to de Rossi, the Swastica from an early period was a favourite form of the cross employed with an occultsignification, which shows the secret was not that of the Christian cross. One Swastica cross in the catacombs is the signof an inscription which reads [['ZOTIKO ZOTIKE]],' 'Vitalis Vitalia,' or 'life of life.' \"*But the best evidence to the antiquity of the cross is that which is brought forward by the author of Natural Genesis onpage 433.\"The value of the cross,\" says Mr. Massey, \"as a Christian symbol, is supposed to date from the time when Jesus Christwas crucified. And yet in the 'Christian' Iconography of the Catacombs no figure of a man appears upon the Cross duringthe first six or seven centuries. There are all forms of the cross except that -- the alleged starting-point of the new religion.That was not the initial but the final form of the Crucifix.** During some six[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Quoted in \"The Natural Genesis\" (p. 427, Vol. I.).** With the Christians, most undeniably.

The earliest known form of the human figure on the cross is the crucifix presented by Pope Gregory theGreat to Queen Theodolinde of Lombardy, now in the Church of St. John at Monza, whilst no image of the Crucified isfound in the Catacombs at Rome earlier than that of San Giulio, belonging to the seventh or eighth century. . . . There isno Christ and no Crucified; the Cross is the Christ even as the Stauros cross was a type and a name of Horus, theGnostic Christ. The Cross, not the Crucified, is the essential object of representation in its art, and of adoration in itsreligion. The germ of the whole growth and development can be traced to the cross. And that cross is pre-Christian, ispagan and heathen, in half a dozen different shapes. The cult began with the cross, and Julian was right in saying hewaged a 'Warfare with the X'; which he obviously considered had been adopted by the A-Gnostics and Mytholators toconvey an impossible significance.* During centuries the cross stood for the Christ, and was addressed as if it were aliving being. It was made divine at first, and humanized at last.\"Few world-symbols are more pregnant with real occult meaning than the Swastica. It is symbolized by the figure 6; for,like that figure, it points in its concrete imagery, as the ideograph of the number does, to the Zenith and the Nadir, toNorth, South, West, and East; one finds the unit everywhere, and that unit reflected in all and every unit. It is the emblemof the activity of Fohat, of the continual revolution of the \"wheels,\" and of the Four Elements, the \"Sacred Four,\" in theirmystical, and not alone in their cosmical meaning; further, its four arms, bent at right angles, are intimately related, asshown elsewhere, to the Pythagorean and Hermetic scales. One initiated into the mysteries of the meaning of theSwastica, say the Commentaries, \"can trace on it, with mathematical precision, the evolution of Kosmos and the wholeperiod of Sandhya.\" Also \"the relation of the Seen to the Unseen,\" and \"the first procreation of man and species.\"To the Eastern Occultist the TREE of Knowledge in the Paradise of man's own heart, becomes the Tree of Life eternal,and has nought to do with man's animal senses. It is an absolute mystery that reveals itself only through the efforts of theimprisoned Manas and the Ego to liberate themselves from the thraldom of sensuous perception and see, in the light ofthe one eternal present Reality. To the Western Kabalist, and now far more to the superficial Symbologist, nursed in thelethal atmosphere of materialistic science, there is but one chief explanation of the mysteries of the Cross -- its sexualelement. Even the otherwise spiritualistic modern commentator discerns in the Cross and Swastica, this feature before allothers.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* So it was, and could not be otherwise.

But the tree or Cross-worship**** of the Jews, asdenounced by their own Prophets, can hardly escape the charge. The \"Sons of Sorcerers,\" \"the seed of the adulterer,\" asIsaiah calls them (lvii.), never lost an opportunity of \"enflaming themselves with idols under every green tree,\" whichdenotes no metaphysical recreation. It is from these monotheistic Jews that the Christian nations have derived theirreligion, their \"God of gods, the One living God,\" while despising and deriding the worship of the Deity of the ancientphilosophers.

Nor is it the Three in One, the triple aspect of the seed -- its form, colour, and substance -- that interest him, but rather the FORCE which directs its growth, the ever mysterious,as the ever unknown. For this vital Force, that makes the seed germinate, burst open and throw out shoots, then form thetrunk and branches, which, in their turn, bend down like the boughs of the Aswattha, the holy Tree of Bodhi, throw theirseed out, take root and procreate other trees -- this is the only FORCE that has reality for him, as it is the never-dyingbreath of life. The pagan philosopher sought for the Cause, the modern is content with only the effects and seeks theformer in the latter. What is beyond, he does not know, nor does the modern A-gnostic care: thus rejecting the onlyknowledge upon which he can with full security base his Science. Yet this manifested Force has an answer for him whoseeks to fathom it. He who sees in the cross, the decussated circle of Plato, the Pagan, not the antitype of circumcision,as Christian (St.) Augustine did,* is forthwith regarded by the Church as a heathen: by Science, as a lunatic. Thisbecause, while refusing to worship the god of physical generation, he confesses that he can know nothing of the Causewhich underlies the so-called First Cause, the causeless Cause of this Vital Cause. Tacitly admitting the All-Presence ofthe boundless Circle and making of it the universal Postulate upon which the whole of the manifested universe is based,the Sage keeps a reverential silence concerning that upon which no mortal men should dare to speculate. \"The Logos ofGod is the revealer of man, and the logos (the verb) of man is the revealer of God,\" says Eliphas Levi in one of hisparadoxes. To this, the Eastern Occultist would reply:-- \"On this condition, however, that man should be dumb on theCAUSE that produced both God and its logos. Otherwise, he becomes invariably the reviler, not the 'revealers' of theincognizable Deity.\"We have now to approach a mystery -- the Hebdomad in nature. Perchance, all that we may say, will be attributed tocoincidence. We may be told that this number in nature is quite natural (so we say too), and has no more significancethan the illusion of motion which forms the so-called \"Strobic circles.\" No great importance was given to these \"singularillusions\" when Professor Sylvanus Thompson exhibited them at the meeting of the British Association in 1877.Nevertheless we should like to learn the scientific explanation why seven should ever form itself as a pre-eminent number-- six concentric circles around a seventh, and seven rings within one another round a central point, etc., etc. -- in thisillusion, produced by a swaying saucer, or any other vessel. We give the solution refused by science in the section whichfollows.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Sermon the 160th.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 590 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.§ XXV.THE MYSTERIES OF THE HEBDOMAD."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"WE must not close this Part on the Symbolism of Archaic History, without an attempt to explain the perpetual recurrenceof this truly mystic number in every scripture known to the Orientalists. As every religion, from the oldest to the latest,claims its presence, and explains it on its own grounds agreeably with its own special dogmas, this is no easy task. Wecan, therefore, do no better or more explanatory work than to give a bird's-eye view of all. These sacred numbers (3, 4, 7)are the sacred numbers of Light, Life, and Union -- especially in this present manvantara, our Life-cycle; of which numberseven is the special representative, or the Factor number. This has now to be demonstrated.If one happened to ask a Brahmin learned in the Upanishads -- so full of the secret wisdom of old, why \"he, of whomseven forefathers have drunk the juice of the moon-plant, is trisuparna,\" as Bopaveda is credited with saying; and why theSomapa Pitris should be worshipped by the Brahmin trisuparna -- very few could answer the question; or, if they knew,they would still less satisfy one's curiosity. Let us, then, hold to what the old Esoteric doctrine teaches.\"When the first 'Seven' appeared on earth, they threw the seed of everything that grows on the land into the soil. Firstcame three, and four were added to these as soon as stone was transformed into plant. Then came the second 'Seven,'who, guiding the Jivas of the plants, produced the middle (intermediate) natures between plant and moving living animal.The third 'Seven' evolved their Chhayas. . . .

For six is therepresentation of the six dimensions of all bodies: the six lines which compose their form, namely, the four lines extendingto the four cardinal points, North, South, East, and West, and the two lines of height and thickness that answer to theZenith and the Nadir. Therefore, while the senary was applied by the sages to physical man, the septenary was for themthe symbol of that man plus his immortal soul.Ragon gives in his Maconnerie Occulte a very good illustration of the \"hieroglyphical senary,\" as he calls our doubleequilateral triangle, [[diagram]]. He shows it as the symbol of the commingling of the \"philosophical three fires and thethree waters, whence results the procreation of the elements of all things. The same idea is found in the Indian equilateraldouble triangle. For, though it is called in that country the sign of Vishnu, yet in truth it is the symbol of the Triad (or theTrimurti). For, even in the exoteric rendering, the lower triangle [[diagram]] with the apex downward, is the symbol ofVishnu, the god of the moist principle and water (\"Nara-yana,\" or the moving Principle in Nara, water;**) while the triangle,with its apex upward, [[diagram]] is Siva, the Principle of Fire, symbolized by the triple flame in his hand.

It is into the water (or chaos, the \"moistprinciple\" of the Greeks and Hermes), that the first seed of the Universe is thrown. \"The 'Spirit of God' moves on the darkwaters of Space\"; hence Thales makes of it the primordial element and prior to Fire, which was yet latent in that Spirit.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 592 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Society -- that produce the Septenary and the Triad at one and the same time, and are the Decad, whatever way this sign[[diagram]] is examined, as all the ten numbers are contained therein.

Like allthe other planets of our system, the Earth has seven Logoi -- the emanating rays of the one \"Father-Ray\" -- thePROTOGONOS, or the manifested \"Logos\" -- he who sacrifices his Esse (or flesh, the Universe) that the world may liveand every creature therein have conscious being.Numbers 3 and 4 are respectively male and female, Spirit and Matter, and their union is the emblem of life eternal in spiriton its ascending arc, and in matter as the ever resurrecting element -- by procreation and reproduction. The spiritual maleline is vertical [[diagram]]; the differentiated matter-line is horizontal; the two forming the cross or [[diagram]]. The former(the 3), is invisible; the latter (the 4), is on the plane of objective perception. This is why all the matter of the Universe,when analyzed by science to its ultimates, can be reduced to four elements only -- carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, andhydrogen: and why the three primaries, the noumenoi of the four, or graduated Spirit or Force, have remained a terraincognita and mere speculations, names, to exact Science.

Salt in solution proves it. For when its molecules, clustering together,begin to deposit themselves as a solid, the first shape they assume is that of triangles, of small pyramids and cones. It isthe figure of fire, whence the word \"pyramids\"; while the second geometrical figure in manifested Nature is a square or acube, 4 and 6; for, \"the particles of earth being cubical, those of fire are pyramidal\" truly -- (Enfield).

Itis the moon which is the guide of the occult side of terrestrial nature, while the Sun is the regulator and factor ofmanifested life; (See also Vol. I., Part II.), and this truth was ever evident to the Seers and the adepts. Jacob Boehme, byinsisting on the fundamental doctrine of the seven properties of everlasting mother Nature, proved himself thereby a greatOccultist.But to return to the consideration of the septenary in ancient religious symbolism. To the metrological key to thesymbolism of the Hebrews, which reveals numerically the geometrical relations of the Circle (All-Deity) to the Square,Cube, Triangle, and all the integral emanations of the divine area, may be added the theogonic Key. This Key explainsthat Noah, the deluge-Patriarch, is in one aspect the permutation of the Deity (the Universal Creative Law), for thepurpose of the formation of our Earth, its population, and the propagation of life on it, in general.Now bearing in mind the Septenary division in divine Hierarchies, as in Cosmic and human constitutions, the student willreadily understand that Jah-Noah is at the head of, and is the synthesis of the lower Cosmic Quaternary. The upperSephirothal [[diagram]], triad -- of which Jehovah-Binah (Intelligence) is the left, female angle -- emanates the [[diagram]]Quaternary.

The question at issue is to show that Jah-Noah, or the Jehovahof the Hebrew Bible, the alleged Creator of our Earth, of man and all upon it, is:--(a) The lowest Septenary, the Creative Elohim -- in his Cosmic aspect.(b) The Tetragrammaton or the Adam-Kadmon, \"the Heavenly Man\" of the Four letters -- in his theogonic and Kabalisticaspects.(c) Noah -- identical with the Hindu Sishta, the human seed, left for the peopling of the Earth from a previous creation orManvantara, as expressed in the Puranas, or the pre-diluvian period as rendered allegorically in the Bible -- in his Cosmiccharacter.But whether a Quaternary (Tetragrammaton) or a Triad, the Bible Creative God is not the Universal 10, unless blendedwith AIN-SOPH (as Brahma with Parabrahm), but a septenary, one of the many Septenaries of the Universal Septenate.In the explanation of the question now in hand, his position and status as Noah may best be shown by placing the 3,[[diagram]],and 4, [[diagram]] on parallel lines with the \"Cosmic\" and \"Human\" principles.

The root derivations are the same with those of Ararat, of acre, of earth.\"As by Hebrew metrology \"Jared, [[hebrew]] is, literally in British Y R D; hence in Jared is to be found literally our Englishword yard (and also [[hebrew]], for Jah, or Jehovah, is rod). It is noteworthy that the son of Jared, viz., Enoch, lived 365years, and it is said of him by rabbinical commentators, that the year period of 365 days was discovered by him, thusbringing, again, time and distance values together, i.e., year time descended by co-ordination, through the yard, or jared,who thus was its father, in or through Enoch; and truly enough, 1296 = yard (or jared) x 4 = 5184, the characteristic valueof the solar day, in thirds, which as stated may be styled the parent numerically, of the solar year\" (ibid. p. 65). This,however, by the astronomical and numerical Kabalistic methods. Esoterically, Jared is the Third race and Enoch theFourth -- but as he is taken away alive he symbolizes also the Elect saved in the Fourth, while Noah is the Fifth from thebeginning -- the family saved from the waters, eternally and physically.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 598 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.chapter vii. of Genesis, \"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male (3), and the female (4); of fowlsalso of the air by sevens,\" etc., etc., followed by all the sevening of days and the rest.-------B.THE TETRAKTIS IN RELATION TO THE HEPTAGON.Thus Number Seven, as a compound of 3 and 4, is the factor element in every ancient religion, because it is the factorelement in nature. Its adoption must be justified, and it must be shown to be the number par excellence, for, since theappearance of \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" frequent objections have been made, and doubts expressed as to the correctness ofthese assertions.And here let the student be told at once, that in all such numerical divisions the ONE universal Principle, -- althoughreferred to as (the) one, because the Only One -- never enters into the calculations. IT stands, in its character of theAbsolute, the Infinite, and the universal abstraction, entirely by ITSELF and independent of every other Power whethernoumenal or phenomenal. IT \"is neither matter nor spirit; IT is neither Ego nor non-Ego; and IT is neither object norsubject,\" says the author of \"Personal and Impersonal God,\" and adds:--\"In the language of Hindu philosophers it is the original and eternal combination of Purusha (Spirit) and Prakriti (matter).As the Adwaitees hold that an external object is merely the product of our mental states, Prakriti is nothing more than anillusion, and Purusha is the only reality; it is the ONE existence which remains in the universe of Ideas. This . . . then, isthe Parabrahm of the Adwaitees. . . . .\"\"Even if there were to be a personal God with anything like a material upadhi (physical basis of whatever form), from thestandpoint of an Adwaitee there will be as much reason to doubt his noumenal existence, as there would be in the caseof any other object. In their opinion, a conscious God cannot be the origin of the Universe, as his Ego would be the effectof a previous cause, if the word conscious conveys but its ordinary meaning. They cannot admit that the grand total of allthe states of consciousness in the Universe is their deity, as these states are constantly changing, and as cosmic ideationceases during Pralaya. There is only one permanent condition in the Universe, which is the state of perfectunconsciousness, bare Chidakasam (the field of consciousness) in fact. When my readers once realize the fact that thisgrand universe is in reality but a huge aggregation of various states of consciousness, they will not be surprised to findthat the ultimate state of unconsciousness is considered as Parabrahmam by the Adwaitees.\"*Being itself entirely out of human reckoning or calculation, yet this \"huge aggregation of various states of consciousness\"is a Septenate,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" Art. \"Personal and Impersonal God.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 599 THE ROOTS OF THINGS."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"in its totality entirely composed of Septenary groups; simply because \"the capacity of perception exists in seven differentaspects corresponding to the seven conditions of matter\" (ibid), or the seven properties, or states, or conditions of matter.And, therefore, number 1 down to number 7 begins in the esoteric calculations with the first manifested principle, which isnumber one if we commence from above, and the seventh when reckoning from below, or from the lowest Principle.The Tetrad is esteemed in the Kabala, as it was by Pythagoras, the most perfect, or rather sacred number, because itemanated from the one, the first manifested Unit, or rather the three in one. Yet the latter has been ever impersonal,sexless, incomprehensible, though within the possibility of the higher mental perceptions.The first manifestation of the eternal monad was never meant to stand as the symbol of another symbol, the UNBORN forthe Element-born, or the one LOGOS for the Heavenly man. Tetragrammaton, or the Tetractys of the Greeks, is theSecond logos, the Demiurgos. The Tetrad, as Thomas Taylor thought (vide the \"Pythagorean Triangle\"), \"is the animalitself of Plato, who, as Syrianus justly observes, was the best of the Pythagoreans; it subsists at the extremity of theintelligible triad, as is most satisfactorily shown by Proclus in the third book of his treatise on the theology of Plato. Andbetween these two triads (the double triangle), the one intelligible, and the other intellectual, another order of gods existswhich partakes of both extremes.\" \"The Pythagorean world,\" Plutarch tells us (in De anim. procr., 1027) \"consisted of adouble quaternary.\" This statement corroborates what is said about the choice, by the exoteric theologies, of the lowerTetraktis. For:-- \"The quaternary of the intellectual world (the world of Mahat) is T'Agathon, Nous, Psyche, Hyle; while thatof the sensible world (of matter), which is properly what Pythagoras meant by the word Kosmos -- is Fire, Air, Water, andEarth. The four elements are called by the name of rizomata, the roots or principles of all mixed bodies,\" i.e., the lowerTetraktis is the root of illusion of the world of matter; and this is the tetragrammaton of the Jews, and the \"mysteriousdeity,\" over which the modern Kabalists make such a fuss!\"Thus number four forms the arithmetical mean between the monad and the heptad, as this contains all powers, both ofthe productive and produced numbers; for this of all numbers under ten, is made of a certain number; the duad doubledmakes a tetrad, and the tetrad doubled or unfolded makes the hebdomad (the septenary). Two multiplied into itselfproduces four; and retorted into itself makes the first cube. This first cube is a fertile number, the ground of multitude andvariety, constituted of two and four (depending on the monad, the seventh). Thus the two principles of temporal things,the pyramis and------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 600 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.cube, form and matter, flow from one fountain, the tetragon (on earth) the monad (in heaven) . . . . \" (See Reuchlin,\"Cabala\" 1, ii.).Here Reuchlin, the great authority on the Kabala, shows the cube to be matter, whereas the pyramid or the triad is \"form.\"With the Hermesians the number four becomes the symbol of truth only when amplified into a cube, which, unfolded,makes seven, as symbolizing the male and female elements and the element of LIFE.*Some students have been puzzled to account for the vertical line, which is male, becoming (vide infra) in the cross a four-partitioned line -- four being a female number, while the horizontal (the line of matter) becomes three-divisioned. But thisis easy of explanation. Since the middle face of the cube unfolded is common to both the vertical and the horizontal bar,or double-line, it becomes neutral ground so to say, and belongs to neither. The spirit line remains triadic, and the matterline two-fold -- two being an even and therefore a female number also. Moreover, according to Theon, the Pythagoreanswho gave the name of Harmony to the Tetraktis, \"because it is a diatessaron in sesquitertia\" -- were of opinion that \"thedivision of the canon of the monochord was made by the tetraktis in the duad, triad, and tetrad; for it comprehends asesquitertia, a sesquialtera, a double, a triple, and a quadruple proportion, the section of which is 27.\" \"In the ancientmusical notation, the tetrachord consisted of three degrees or intervals, and four terms of sounds called by the Greeksdiatessaron, and by us a fourth.\" Moreover, the quaternary though an even, therefore a female (\"infernal\") number, variedaccording to its form. This is shown by Stanley (in Pythag. p. 61). The 4 was called by the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In the \"Hebrew Egyptian Mystery, the Source of Measures,\" the Author shows (on p. 50) that the figure of the cubeunfolded in connection with the circle . . . . \"becomes . . a cross proper, or of the tau form, and the attachment of the circleto this last gives the ansated cross of the Egyptians . . . . while there are but 6 faces to a cube, the representation of thecross as the cube unfolded, as to the cross-bars, displays one face of the cube as common to two bars, counted asbelonging to either . . .

This is achieved by the cube unfolded. Hence the ansated cross[[diagram]] as the symbol of man, generation and life. In Egypt ank signified soul, life and blood. It is the ensouled, livingman, the Septenary.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 601 THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.Pythagoreans the Key-Keeper of Nature; but in union with the 3, which made it seven, it became the most perfect andharmonious number -- nature herself. The four was \"the Masculine of Feminine Form,\" when forming the Cross; andSeven is \"the Master of the Moon,\" for this planet is forced to alter her appearance every seven days. It is on numberseven that Pythagoras composed his doctrine on the Harmony and Music of the Spheres, calling \"a tone\" the distance of"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"the Moon from the Earth; from the Moon to Mercury half a tone, from thence to Venus the same; from Venus to the Sun l1/2 tones; from the Sun to Mars a tone; from thence to Jupiter 1/2 a tone; from Jupiter to Saturn 1/2 a tone; and thence tothe Zodiac a tone; thus making seven tones -- the diapason harmony. All the melody of nature is in those seven tones,and therefore is called \"the Voice of Nature.\"Plutarch explains (de Plac. Phil., p. 878) that the Achaean Greeks regarded the tetrad as the root and principle of allthings, since it was the number of the elements which gave birth to all visible and invisible created things. With thebrothers of the Rosy Cross, the figure of the Cross, or Cube unfolded, formed the subject of a disquisition in one of thetheosophic degrees of Peuret, and was treated according to the fundamental principles of light and darkness, or goodand evil.\"The intelligible world proceeds out of the divine mind (or unit) after this manner. The Tetraktis reflecting upon its ownessence, the first unit, productrix of all things, and on its own beginning, saith thus: Once one, twice two, immediatelyariseth a tetrad, having on its top the highest unit, and becomes a Pyramis, whose base is a plain tetrad, answerable to asuperficies, upon which the radiant light of the divine unity produceth the form of incorporeal fire, by reason of the descentof Juno (matter) to inferior things. Hence ariseth essential light, not burning but illuminating. This is the creation of themiddle world, which the Hebrews call the Supreme, the world of the (their) deity. It is termed Olympus, entirely light, andreplete with separate forms, where is the seat of the immortal gods, 'deum domus alta,' whose top is UNITY, its walltrinity, and its superficies quaternity.\" (Reuchlin, Cabala, p. 689).The \"superficies\" has thus to remain a meaningless surface, if left by itself. UNITY only \"illuminating\" quaternity; thefamous lower four has to build for itself also a wall from trinity, if it would be manifested. Moreover, the tetragrammaton, orMicroprosopus, is \"Jehovah\" arrogating to himself very improperly the \"Was, Is, Will be,\" now translated into the \"I am thatI am,\" and interpreted as referring to the highest abstract Deity, while esoterically and in plain truth, it means onlyperiodically chaotic, turbulent, and eternal MATTER with all its potentialities. For the Tetragrammaton is one with Natureor Isis, and is the exoteric series of androgyne gods such as Osiris-Isis, Jove-Juno, Brahma-Vach, or the Kabalistic Jah-hovah; all male-females. Every anthropomorphic god, in old nations, as Marcelinus Vicinus well observed,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 602 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.has his name written with four letters. Thus with the Egyptians, he was Teut; the Arabs, Alla; the Persians, Sire; the Magi,Orsi; the Mohammedans, Abdi; the Greeks, Theos; the ancient Turks, Esar; the Latins, Deus; to which J. Lorenzo Ananiaadds the German Gott; the Sarmatian, Bouh, etc., etc.The Monad being one, and an odd number, the ancients therefore called the odd, the only perfect numbers; and --selfishly, perhaps, yet as a fact -- considered them all as masculine and perfect, being applicable to the celestial gods,while even numbers, such as two, four, six, and especially eight, as being female, were regarded as imperfect, and givenonly to the terrestrial and infernal deities. In his eighth eclogue, Virgil records the fact by saying, \"Numero deus imparegaudet,\" \"Unequal numbers please the gods.\"But number seven, or the heptagon, the Pythagoreans considered to be a religious and perfect number. It was called\"Telesphoros,\" because by it all in the Universe and mankind is led to its end, i.e., its culmination (Philo. de Mund. opif.).Being under the rule of seven sacred planets,* the doctrine of the Spheres shows, from Lemuria to Pythagoras, the sevenpowers of terrestrial and sublunary nature, as well as the seven great Forces of the Universe, proceeding and evolving inseven tones, which are the seven notes of the musical scale. The heptad (our Septenary) was regarded \"as the numberof a virgin, because it is unborn\" (like the Logos or the \"Aja\" of the Vedantins); \"without a father or a mother, butproceeding directly from the Monad, which is the origin and crown of all things.\" (Pythag. Triangle, p. 174.) And if theheptad is made to proceed from the Monad directly, then it is, as taught in the Secret Doctrine of the oldest schools, theperfect and sacred number of this Maha-Manvantara of ours.The septenary, or heptad, was sacred indeed to several gods and goddesses; to Mars, with his seven attendants, toOsiris, whose body was divided into seven and twice seven parts; to Apollo (the Sun), between his seven planets, andplaying the hymn to the seven-rayed on his seven-stringed harp; to Minerva, the fatherless and the motherless, andothers.Cis-Himalayan Occultism with its sevening, and because of such sevening, must be regarded as the most ancient, theoriginal of all. It is opposed by some fragments left by Neo-Platonists; and the admirers of the latter, who hardlyunderstand what they defend, say to us: \"See, your forerunners believed only in triple man, composed of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The seven planets are not limited to this number because the ancients knew of no others, but simply because they werethe primitive or primordial houses of the seven Logoi.

Behold, the Taraka Raja Yoga of India limits that division to 3, we, to 4, and the Vedantins to 5(koshas).\" To this, we of the Archaic school, ask:--Why then does the Greek poet say that \"it is not four but SEVEN who sing the praise of the Spiritual Sun,\" [[HEPTA ME]]?He says--\"Seven sounding letters sing the praise of me,The immortal God, the Almighty deity.\" . . ."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Why again is the triune IAO (the Mystery God) called the \"fourfold,\" and yet the triad and tetradic symbols come underone unified name with the Christians -- the Jehovah of the seven letters? Why again in the Hebrew Sheba is the Oath (thePythagorean Tetraktis) identical with number 7; or, as Mr. G. Massey has it, \"taking an oath was synonymous with 'toseven,' and the 10 expressed by the letter Yod, was the full number of IAO-SABAOTH, the ten-lettered God\"? In Lucian'sAuction, Pythagoras asks, \"How do you reckon?\" The reply is, \"One, Two, Three, Four.\" \"Then, do you see,\" saysPythagoras, \"in what you conceive FOUR there are Ten; then, a perfect triangle and our Oath (tetraktis, four!),\" or Seven.Why does Proclus say in Timaeus, c. iii. -- \"The Father of the golden verses celebrates the Tetractys as the fountain ofperennial nature\"?Simply because those Western Kabalists who quote the exoteric proofs against us have no idea of the real esotericmeaning. Because all the ancient Cosmologies -- the oldest Cosmographies of the two most ancient people of the FifthRoot Race, the Hindu Aryans and the Egyptians, adding to them the early Chinese races (the remnants of the Fourth orAtlantean Race) -- based the whole of their mysteries on number 10: the higher triangle standing for the invisible andmetaphysical world, the lower three and four, or the Septenate, for the physical realm. It is not the Jewish Bible thatbrought number seven into prominence. Hesiod used the words \"The seventh is the sacred day,\" before the Sabbath of\"Moses\" was ever heard of. The use of number seven was never confined to any one nation. This is well testified by theseven vases in the temple of the Sun, near the ruins of Babion in Upper Egypt; the seven fires burning continually forages before the altars of Mithra; the seven holy fanes of the Arabians; the seven peninsulas, the seven islands, sevenseas, mountains, and rivers of India; and of the Zohar (See Ibn Gebirol); the Jewish Sephiroth of the Seven splendours;the seven Gothic deities, the seven worlds of the Chaldeans and their seven Spirits; the seven constellations mentionedby Hesiod and Homer; and all the interminable sevens which the Orientalists find in every MS. they discover.What we have to say finally is this: Enough has been brought forward to show why the human principles were and aredivided in the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 604 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.esoteric schools into seven. Make it four and it will either leave man minus his lower terrestrial elements, or, if viewedfrom a physical stand-point, make of him a soulless animal. The Quaternary must be the higher or the lower -- thecelestial or terrestrial Tetraktis: to become comprehensible, according to the teachings of the esoteric ancient school manmust be regarded as a Septenary. This was so well understood, that even the so-called Christian Gnostics had adoptedthis time-honoured system (Vide § on \"The Seven Souls\"). This remained for a long time secret as, though suspected, noMSS. of that time spoke of it clearly enough to satisfy the sceptic. But there comes to our rescue the literary curiosity ofour age -- the oldest and best preserved gospel of the Gnostics, Pistis Sophia [[Pictic Cophia]]. To make the proofabsolutely complete, we shall quote from an authority (C. W. King) -- the only archaeologist who had a faint glimmer ofthis elaborate doctrine, and the best writer of the day on the Gnostics and their gems.According to this extraordinary piece of religious literature -- a true Gnostic fossil -- the human Entity is the Septenary rayfrom the One,* just as our school teaches. It is composed of seven elements, four of which are borrowed from the fourKabalistical manifested worlds. Thus \"from Asia it gets the Nephesh or seat of the physical appetites (vital breath, also);from Jezirah, the Ruach, or seat of the passions (? !); from Briah, the Neshamah, and from Aziluth it obtains the Chaiah,or principle of spiritual life;\" (King). \"This looks like an adaptation of the Platonic theory of the Soul's obtaining itsrespective faculties from the Planets in its downward progress through their Spheres. But the Pistis-Sophia, with itsaccustomed boldness, puts this theory into a much more poetical shape (§ 282).\" The Inner Man is similarly made up offour constituents, but these are supplied by the rebellious AEons of the Spheres, being the Power -- a particle of theDivine light (\"Divinae particula aurae\") yet left in themselves; the Soul (the fifth) \"formed out of the tears of their eyes, andthe sweat of their torments; the [[Antimimon Prieumatos]], Counterfeit of the Spirit (seemingly answering to ourConscience), (the sixth); and lastly the [[Moira]], Fate** (Karmic Ego), whose[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Seven Centres of Energy evolved, or rendered objective by the action of Fohat upon the one element; or, in fact,the \"Seventh Principle\" of the Seven Elements which exist throughout manifested Kosmos. We may here point out thatthey are in truth the Sephiroth of the Kabalists; the \"Seven gifts of the Holy Ghost\" in the Christian system; and in amystical sense, the seven children or sons of Devaki killed before the birth of Krishna by Kamsa. Our seven principlessymbolize all of these. We have to part or separate from them before we reach the Krishna or Christ-state, that of aJivanmukta, and centre ourselves entirely in the highest, the Seventh or the ONE.** [[Moira]] is destiny, not \"Fate,\" in this case, as it is an appellation, not a proper noun.

Roth is right. \"Angirases\" wasone of the names of the Dhyanis, or Devas instructors (\"guru-deva\"), of the late Third, the Fourth, and even of the FifthRace Initiates.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 606 THE SECRET DOCTRINE. In these Hymns the \"Heavenly Man\" is called purusha, \"the Man,\" (X. 90, 1) from whom Viraj was born (X. 90, 5); andfrom Viraj, the (mortal) man. It is Varuna (now drawn from his sublime position to be the chief of the lords-Dhyanis orDevas) who regulates all natural phenomena, who \"makes a path for the Sun, for him to follow.\" The seven rivers of thesky (the descending creative gods) and the seven rivers of the earth (the seven primitive mankinds) are under his control,as will be seen. For he who breaks Varuna's laws (Vratani, \"courses of natural action,\" active laws) is punished by Indra(X. 113, 5), the Vedic powerful god, whose Vrata (law or power) is greater than the Vratani of any other god.Thus, the Rig Veda, the oldest of all the known ancient records, may be shown to corroborate the occult teachings inalmost every respect. Its hymns -- the records written by the earliest Initiates of the Fifth (our race) concerning theprimordial teachings -- speak of the Seven Races (two still to come) allegorising them by the \"seven streams\" (1, 35, 8);and of the Five Races (\"panca krishtayah\") which have already inhabited this world (ibid) on the five regions \"pancapradicah\" (IX, 86, 29), as also of the three continents that were.*It is those scholars only who will master the secret meaning of the Purushasukta (in which the intuition of the modernOrientalist has chosen to see \"one of the very latest hymns of the Rig-Veda\"), who may hope to understand howharmonious are its teachings and how corroborative of the Esoteric doctrines. One must study in all the abstruseness oftheir metaphysical meaning the relations in it between the (Heavenly) man \"Purusha,\" SACRIFICED for the production ofthe Universe and all in it (See Visvakarman), and the terrestrial mortal man (Hymn X. 20, 1, 16), before one realizes thehidden philosophy of this verse:--\"15. He (\"Man,\" purusha, or Visvakarman) had seven enclosing logs of fuel, and thrice seven layers of fuel; when thegods performed the sacrifice, they bound the Man as victim\" . . . .

It may, and must have come down to us disfigured andmisinterpreted, as in the case of the Parsis, who read it in their Vendidad and elsewhere, without understanding theallusions they contain any better than the Orientalists do; yet the doctrine is plainly mentioned in their old works. (See theenumeration of the seven spheres --not the \"Karshvare of the earth,\" as believed -- in Fargard XIX., 30). But see furtheron.Comparing the esoteric teaching with the interpretations by James Darmesteter (the Vendidad, edited by Prof. MaxMuller), one may see at a glance where the mistake is made, and the cause that produced it. The passage runs thus:--\"The Indo-Iranian Asura (Ahura) was often conceived as seven-fold; by the play of certain mythical (?) formulae and thestrength of certain mythical (?) numbers, the ancestors of the Indo-Iranians had been led to speak of seven worlds,** andthe Supreme God was often made seven-fold, as well as the worlds over which he ruled.\" (Vide the foot note). \"The"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"seven worlds became in Persia the seven Karshvare of the earth: the earth is divided into seven Karshvare, only one ofwhich is known and accessible to man, the one on which we live, namely, Hvaniratha; which amounts to saying that thereare seven earths.*** Parsi mythology knows also of seven heavens. Hvaniratha itself is divided into seven climes. (Orm.Ahr. § 72. \"Vendidad Introd. p. Lx.,)\" and the same division and doctrine is to be found in the oldest and most revered ofthe Hindu[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Nor is this archaic teaching so very unscientific, since one of the greatest naturalists of the age -- the late ProfessorAgassiz -- admitted the multiplicity of the geographical origins of man, and supported it to the end of his life. The unity ofthe human species was accepted by the illustrious Professor of Cambridge (U.S.A.) in the same way as the Occultists do-- namely, in the sense of their essential and original homogeneity and their origin from one and the same source:-- e.g.,Negroes, Aryans, Mongols, etc., have all originated in the same way and from the same ancestors. The latter were all ofone essence, yet differentiated, because belonging to seven planes which differed in degree though not in kind. Thatoriginal physical difference was but little more accentuated by that of geographical and climatic conditions, later on. Thisis not the theory of Agassiz, of course, but the esoteric version. It is fully discussed in the Addenda (Part III.).** The seven worlds are, as said, the seven spheres of the chain, each presided over by one of the \"Seven great gods\" ofevery religion. When the latter became degraded and anthropomorphized, and the metaphysical ideas nearly forgotten,the synthesis or the highest, the seventh, was separated from the rest, and that personification became the eighth god,whom monotheism tried to unify but -- failed. In no exoteric religion is God really one, if analyzed metaphysically.*** The six invisible globes of our chain are both \"worlds\" and \"earths\" as is our own, albeit invisible. But where could bethe Six invisible earths on this globe?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 608 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.scriptures -- the Rig-veda. Mention is made therein of six worlds, besides our earth: the six rajamsi above prithivi -- theearth, -- or \"this\" (idam) as opposed to that which is yonder (i.e., the six globes on the three other planes or worlds). (SeeRig-veda I. 34, III. 56; VII 10, 411, and V., 60. 6).The italics are ours to point out the identity of the tenets with those of the esoteric doctrine, and the mistake made. TheMagi or Mazdeans only believed in what other people believed in; namely, in seven \"worlds\" or globes of our planetarychain, of which only one is accessible to man (at the present time), our Earth; and in the successive appearance anddestruction of seven continents or earths on this our globe, each continent being divided, in commemoration of the sevenglobes (one visible, six invisible), into seven islands or continents, \"seven climes,\" etc., etc. This was a common belief inthose days when the now Secret Doctrine was open to all. It is this multiplicity of localities under Septenary division, thatmade the Orientalists (led astray, moreover, by the oblivion of both the uninitiated Hindus and Parsis of their primitivedoctrines) feel so puzzled by this ever-recurring seven-fold number, as to regard it as \"mythical.\" It is that oblivion of thefirst principles which has led the Orientalists off the right track and made them commit the greatest blunders. The samefailure is found in the definition of the Gods. Those who are ignorant of the esoteric doctrine of the earliest Aryans, cannever assimilate or understand correctly the metaphysical meaning contained in these BEINGS.Ahura Mazda (Ormazd) was the head and synthesis of the seven Amesha Spentas (or Amshaspends), and, therefore, anAmesha Spenta himself. Just as \"Jehovah-Binah Arelim\" was the head and synthesis of the Elohim and no more; soAgni-Vishnu-Surya was the synthesis and head, or the focus whence emanated in physics as in metaphysics, from theSpiritual as from the physical Sun, the Seven Rays, the seven fiery tongues, the seven planets or gods. All these becamesupreme gods and the ONE GOD, but only after the loss of the primeval secrets, the sinking of Atlantis, or \"the Flood,\"and the occupation of India by the Brahmans, who sought safety on the summits of the Himalayas, when even the hightable-lands of what is now Tibet became submerged for a time. Ahura Mazda is addressed only as \"the Most BlissfulSpirit, Creator of the corporeal World\" in the Vendidad. \"Ahura Mazda\" in its literal translation means the \"Wise Lord\"(Ahura \"lord,\" and Mazda \"wise\"). Moreover, this name of Ahura, in Sanskrit Asura, connects him with the Manasaputras,the Sons of Wisdom who informed the mindless man, and endowed him with his mind (manas). Ahura (asura) may bederived from the root ah \"to be,\" but in its primal signification it is what the Secret Teaching shows it to be.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 609 THE ZOROASTRIAN SEPTENARY.When geology shall have found out how many thousands of years ago the disturbed waters of the Indian Ocean reachedthe highest plateaux of Central Asia, when the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf made one with it, then only will theyknow the age of the Aryan Brahminical nation, and the time of its descent into the plains of Hindostan, which it didmillenniums later.Yima, the so-called \"first man\" in the Vendidad, as much as his twin-brother Yama, the Son of Vaivasvata Manu, belongsto two epochs of the Universal History. He is the \"Progenitor\" of the Second human Race, hence the personification of theshadows of the Pitris, and the father of the postdiluvian Humanity. The Magi said \"Yima,\" as we say \"man\" when speakingof mankind. The \"fair Yima,\" the first mortal who converses with Ahura Mazda, is the first \"man\" who dies or disappears,not the first who is born. The \"Son of Vixanghat,\" was, like the Son of Vaivasvata, the symbolical man, who stood inesotericism as the representative of the first three races and the collective Progenitor thereof. Of these races the first twonever died* but only vanished, absorbed in their progeny, and the third knew death only towards its close, after theseparation of the sexes and its \"Fall\" into generation. This is plainly alluded to in the II. Fargard of the Vendidad. Yimarefuses to become the bearer of the law of Ahura Mazda, saying \"I was not born, I was not taught to be the preacher andthe bearer of thy law.\" And then Ahura Mazda asks him to make his men increase and \"watch over his world\" (3 and 4).He refuses to become the priest of Ahura Mazda, because he is his own priest and sacrificer, but he accepts the secondproposal. He is made to answer:--"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"\"Yes! . . . yes, I will rule and watch over thy world. There shall be, while I am King, neither cold wind nor hot wind, neitherdisease nor death.\"Then Ahura Mazda brings him a golden ring and a poniard, the emblems of sovereignty, and under the sway of Yima --\"Three hundred winters passed away, and the earth was replenished with flocks and herds, with men, and dogs, andbirds, and with red blazing fires,\" etc. (300 winters mean 300 periods or cycles.)\"Replenished,\" mark well, that is to say, all this had been on it before; and thus is proven the knowledge of the doctrineabout the successive destructions of the world and its life cycles. Once the \"300 winters\" were over, Ahura Mazda warnsYima that the earth is becoming too full, and men have nowhere to live. Then Yima steps forward, and with the help ofSpenta Armaita (the female genius, or Spirit of the Earth) makes that earth stretch out and become larger by[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Death came only after man had become a physical creature, vide supra. The men of the First Race and also of theSecond, dissolved and disappeared in their progeny.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 610 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.one-third, after which \"new herds and flocks and men\" appear upon it. Ahura Mazda warns him again, and Yima makesthe earth by the same magic power to become larger by two-thirds. \"Nine hundred winters\" pass away, and Yima has toperform the ceremony for the third time. The whole of this is allegorical. The three processes of stretching the earth, referto the three successive continents and races issuing one after and from the other, as explained more fully elsewhere.After the third time, Ahura Mazda warns Yima in an assembly of \"celestial gods and excellent mortals\" that upon thematerial world the fatal winters are going to fall, and all life will perish. This is the old Mazdean symbolism for the \"flood,\"and the coming cataclysm to Atlantis, which sweeps away every race in its turn. Like Vaivasvata Manu and Noah, Yimamakes a vara (an enclosure, an ark) under the God's direction, and brings thither the seed of every living creature,animals and \"fires.\"It is of this \"earth\" or new continent that Zarathustra became the law-giver and ruler. This was the Fourth Race in itsbeginning, after the men of the Third began to die out. Till then, as said (vide supra, foot note) there had been no regulardeath, but only a transformation, for men had no personality as yet. They had monads -- breaths of the ONE Breath, andas impersonal as the source from which they proceeded. They had bodies, or rather shadows of bodies, which weresinless, hence Karmaless. Therefore, as there was no Kamaloka -- least of all Nirvana or even Devachan -- for the \"souls\"of men who had no personal Egos, there could be no intermediate periods between the incarnations. Like the Phoenix,primordial man resurrected out of his old into a new body. Each time, and with each new generation, he became moresolid, more physically perfect, agreeably with the evolutionary law, which is the Law of Nature. Death came with thecomplete physical organism, and with it -- moral decay.This explanation shows one more old religion agreeing in its symbology with the universal Doctrine.Elsewhere the oldest Persian traditions, the relics of Mazdeism of the still older Magians, are given, and some of themexplained. Mankind did not issue from one solitary couple. Nor was there ever a first man -- whether Adam or Yima -- buta first mankind.It may, or may not be, \"mitigated polygenism.\" Once that both creation ex-nihilo -- an absurdity -- and a superhumanCreator or creators -- a fact -- are made away with by science, polygenism presents no more difficulties orinconveniences (rather fewer from a scientific point of view) than monogenism does.Nevertheless, it is as scientific as any other claim. For in his Introduction to Nott's and Gliddon's \"Types of Mankind,\"Agassiz declares------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 611 THE SEPTENATE IN THE PURANAS.his belief in an indefinite number of \"primordial races of men created separately\"; and remarks that, \"whilst in everyzoological province animals are of different species, man, in spite of the diversity of his races, always forms one and thesame human being.\"Occultism defines and limits the number of primordial races to seven, because of the \"seven progenitors,\" or prajapatis,the evolvers of beings. These are neither gods, nor supernatural Beings, but advanced Spirits from another and lowerplanet, reborn on this one, and giving birth in their turn in the present Round to present Humanity. This doctrine is againcorroborated by one of its echoes -- the Gnostic. In their Anthropology and Genesis of man they taught that \"a certaincompany of Seven angels,\" formed the first men, who were no better than senseless, gigantic, shadowy forms -- \"a merewriggling worm\" (!) writes Irenaeus (I., 24, 1), who takes, as usual, the metaphor for reality.-------D.THE SEPTENARY IN THE EXOTERIC WORKS.We may now examine other ancient Scriptures and see whether they contain the septenary classification, and, if so, towhat degree."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"As much, if not much more, even than in the Jewish Bible, scattered about in the thousands of Sanskrit texts, some stillunopened, others yet unknown, as well as in all the Puranas, the numbers seven and forty-nine (7 x 7) play a mostprominent part. They are found from the Seven creations in Chapter I., down to the seven rays of the Sun at the finalPralaya, which expand into Seven Suns and absorb the material of the whole Universe. Thus the Matsya Purana has:\"For the sake of promulgating the Vedas, Vishnu, in the beginning of a Kalpa, related to Manu the story of Narasimha andthe events of seven Kalpas.\" Then again the same Purana shows that \"in all the Manvantaras, classes of Rishis* appearby seven and seven, and having established a code of law and morality depart to felicity\" -- the Rishis representing manyother things besides living Sages.In Hymn xix., 53, of Atharva Veda (Dr. Muir's translation) one reads:--[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"These are the seven persons by whom in the several Manvantaras\" -- says Parasara -- \"created beings have beenprotected.

Even the Pravahawind (the mystic and occult Force that gives the impulse to, and regulates the course of the stars and planets) isseptenary. The Kurma and Linga Puranas enumerate seven principal winds of that name, which winds are the principlesof Cosmic Space. They are intimately connected with Dhruva** (now Alpha), the Pole-Star, which is connected in its turnwith the production of various phenomena through cosmic forces.Thus, from the Seven Creations, seven Rishis, Zones, Continents, Principles, etc., etc. in the Aryan Scriptures, thenumber has passed through Indian, Egyptian, Chaldaic, Greek, Jewish, Roman, and finally Christian mystic thought, untilit landed in and remained impressed indelibly on every exoteric theology.

The Vayu Purana shows, andHarivansa corroborates, that the Maruts -- the oldest as the most incomprehensible of all the secondary or lower gods inthe Rig Veda -- \"are born in every manvantara (Round) seven times seven (or 49); that in each Manvantara, four timesseven (or twenty-eight) they obtain emancipation, but their places are filled up by persons reborn in that character.\" Whatare the Maruts in their esoteric meaning, and who those persons \"reborn in that character\"? In the Rig and other Vedas,the Maruts are represented as the storm gods and the friends and allies of Indra; they are the \"Sons of heaven and ofearth.\" This led to an allegory that makes them the children of Siva, the great patron of the Yogis, \"the MAHA-YOGI, thegreat ascetic, in whom is centred the highest perfection of austere penance and abstract meditation, by which the mostunlimited powers are obtained, marvels and miracles are worked, the highest spiritual knowledge is acquired, and unionwith the great spirit of the universe is eventually gained.\" In the Rig Veda the name Siva is unknown, but the god is calledRudra, which is a word used for Agni, the fire god, the Maruts being called therein his sons.

But Indra foils her in the design. With his thunderbolt hedivides the embryo in her womb into seven portions, and then divides every such portion into seven pieces again, whichbecome the swift-moving deities, the Maruts.* These deities are only another aspect, or a development of the Kumaras,who are Rudras in their patronymic, like many others.**Diti, being Aditi, unless the contrary is proven to us, Aditi, we say, or Akasa in her highest form, is the Egyptian seven-foldheaven.

Diti, the mother of the Maruts, is one of her terrestrial forms, madeto represent, at one and the same time, the divine Soul in the ascetic, and the divine aspirations of mystic Humanitytoward deliverance from the webs of Maya, and final bliss in consequence. Indra, now degraded, because of the KaliYuga, when such aspirations are no more general but have become abnormal through a general spread of Ahamkara(the feeling of Egotism, Self, or I-AM-NESS) and ignorance -- was, in the beginning, one of the greatest gods of the HinduPantheon, as the Rig Veda shows. Sura-dhipa, \"the chief of the gods,\" has fallen down from Jishnu, \"the leader of thecelestial host,\" -- the Hindu St. Michael -- to an opponent of asceticism, the enemy of every holy aspiration. He is shownmarried to Aindri (Indrani), the personification of Aindri-yaka, the evolution of the element of senses, whom he married\"because of her voluptuous attractions\"; after which he began sending celestial female demons to excite the passions ofholy men, Yogis, and \"to beguile them from the potent penances which he dreaded.\" Therefore, Indra, now characterizedas \"the god of the firmament, the personified atmosphere\" -- is in reality the cosmic principle Mahat, and the fifth human --Manas in its dual aspect: as connected with Buddhi; and as allowing himself to be dragged down by his Kama-principle(the body of passions and desires). This is demonstrated by Brahma telling the conquered god that his frequent defeatswere due to Karma, and were a punishment for his licentiousness, and the seduction of various nymphs. It is in this lattercharacter that he seeks, to save himself from destruction, to destroy the coming \"babe\" destined to conquer him:-- thebabe, of course, allegorizing the divine and steady will of the Yogi -- determined to resist all such temptations, and thusdestroy the passions within his earthly personality. Indra succeeds again, because flesh conquers spirit -- (Diti is shownfrustrated in the Dvapara Yug, during that period when the Fourth Race was flourishing). He divides the \"Embryo\" (of newdivine adeptship, begotten once more by the Ascetics of the Aryan Fifth Race), into seven portions -- a reference notalone to the seven sub-races of the new Root-Race, in each of which there will be a \"Manu,\"* but also to the sevendegrees of adeptship -- and then each[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Notwithstanding the terrible, and evidently purposed, confusion of Manus, Rishis, and their progeny in the Puranas, onething is made clear: there have been and there will be seven Rishis in every Root-Race (called also Manvantara in thesacred books) as there are fourteen Manus in every Round, the \"presiding gods, the Rishis and Sons of the Manus\" beingidentical. (See Book III. ch. 1 of Vishnu Purana.) \"Six\" Manvantaras are given, the Seventh being our own in the VishnuPurana. The Vayu Purana furnishes the nomenclature of the Sons of the fourteen Manus in every Manvantara, and theSons of the seven Sages or Rishis. The latter are the progeny [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 615 THE DOOM OF CONTINUAL REBIRTH.portion into seven pieces -- alluding to the Manu-Rishis of each Root-Race, and even sub-race.It does not seem difficult to perceive what is meant by the Maruts obtaining \"four times seven\" emancipations in every\"manvantara,\" and by those persons who, being reborn in that character (of the Maruts in their esoteric meaning), \"fill uptheir places.\" The Maruts represent (a) the passions that storm and rage within every candidate's breast, when preparingfor an ascetic life -- this mystically; (b) the occult potencies concealed in the manifold aspects of Akasa's lower principles -- her body, or sthula sarira, representing the terrestrial, lower, atmosphere of every inhabited globe -- this mystically andsidereally; (c) actual conscious Existences, Beings of a cosmic and psychic nature.At the same time \"Maruts\" is, in occult parlance, one of the names given to those EGOS of great Adepts who havepassed away, and who are known also as Nirmanakayas; of those Egos for whom -- since they are beyond illusion --there is no Devachan, and who, having either voluntarily renounced it for the good of mankind, or not yet reachedNirvana, remain invisible on earth. Therefore are the Maruts* shown firstly -- as the sons of Siva-Rudra -- the \"PatronYogi,\" whose \"third eye,\" mystically, must be acquired by the ascetic before he becomes an adept; then, in their cosmiccharacter, as the subordinates of Indra and his opponents -- variously. The \"four times seven\" emancipations have areference to the four Rounds, and the four Races that preceded ours, in each of which Marut-Jivas (monads) have beenre-born, and have obtained final liberation, if they have only availed themselves of it. Instead of which, preferring the goodof mankind, which would struggle still more hopelessly in the meshes of ignorance and misery, were it not for thisextraneous help -- they are re-born over and over again \"in that character,\" and thus \"fill up their own places.\" Who theyare, \"on earth\" -- every student of Occult science knows.

All the Puranas speak of the seven Prajapatis ofthis period (Round).* \"Chakshuba was the Manu of the sixth period (Third Round and Third Race), in which Indra was Manojava\"(Mantradruma in the Bhagavata Purana). As there is a perfect analogy between the \"great Round\" (Mahakalpa), each ofthe seven Rounds, and each of the seven great Races in every one of the Rounds -- therefore, Indra of the sixth period,or Third Round, corresponds to the close of the Third Race (at the time of the Fall or the separation of sexes). Rudra, asthe father of the Maruts, has many points of contact with Indra, the Marutwan, or \"lord of the Maruts.\" To receive a nameRudra is said to have wept for it. Brahma called him Rudra; but he wept seven times more and so obtained seven othernames -- of which he uses one during each \"period.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 616 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The same for the Septenary Division of Kosmos and human principles. The Puranas, along with other sacred texts, teemwith allusions to this. First of all, the mundane Egg which contained Brahma, or the Universe, \"was externally investedwith seven natural elements, at first loosely enumerated as Water, Air, Fire, Ether, and three secret elements\" (Book I.);then the \"World\" is said to be \"encompassed on every side\" by seven elements, also within the egg -- as explained, \"theuniverse is encompassed on every side, above and below by the Andakat'aha -- the shell of the egg of Brahma.\" . . .Around the shell flows water, which is surrounded with fire; fire by air; air by ether; ether by the origin of the elements(Ahamkara); the latter by Universal Mind (\"Intellect\" in the Texts) (Book II., ch. VII. Vishnu Purana). It relates to spheres ofbeing as much as to principles. Prithivi is not our Earth, but the World, the Solar system, and means the broad, the Wide.In the Vedas -- the greatest of all authorities, though needing the key to read it correctly -- three terrestrial and threecelestial earths are mentioned as having been called into existence simultaneously with Bhumi -- our earth. We haveoften been told that six, not seven, appears to be the number of spheres, principles, etc. We answer that there are, infact, only six principles in man; since his body is no principle, but the covering, the shell thereof. So with the planetarychain; speaking of which, esoterically, the Earth (as well as the seventh, or rather fourth plane, one that stands as theseventh if we count from the first triple kingdom of the Elementals that begin the formation) may be left out ofconsideration, being (to us) the only distinct body of the seven. The language of occultism is varied. But supposing thatthree earths only, instead of seven, are meant in the Vedas, what are those three, since we still know of but one?Evidently there must be an occult meaning in the statement under consideration. Let us see. The \"Earth that floats\" on theUniversal Ocean (of Space), which Brahma divides in the Puranas into seven zones, is Prithivi, the world divided intoseven principles; a cosmic division looking metaphysical enough, but, in reality, physical in its occult effects. Many Kalpaslater, our Earth is mentioned, and, in its turn, is divided into seven zones* on that same law of analogy that guided ancientphilosophers. After which one finds on it seven continents, seven isles, seven oceans, seven seas and rivers, sevenmountains, and seven climates, etc., etc., etc.**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See the Puranas.** In Vishnu Purana, Book II., chap. iv., it is stated that the EARTH, \"with its continents, mountains, oceans, and exteriorshell, is fifty crores (500 millions) of yojanas in extent,\" to which the commentator remarks that \"this comprises theplanetary spheres; for the diameter of the seven zones and oceans -- each ocean being of the same diameter as thecontinent it encloses, and each successive continent being twice the [[Footnot continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 617 PERSIAN SYMBOLOGY.Furthermore, it is not only in the Hindu Scriptures and philosophy that one finds references to the Seven Earths, but in thePersian, Phoenician, Chaldean, and Egyptian Cosmogonies, and even in Rabbinical literature. The Phoenix* -- called bythe Hebrews Onech [Heb char] (from Phenoch, Enoch, symbol of a secret cycle and initiation), and by the Turks, Kerkes -- lives a thousand years, after which, kindling a flame, it is self-consumed; and then, reborn from itself -- it lives anotherthousand years, up to seven times seven: (See \"Book of Ali\" -- Russian transl.), when comes the day of Judgment. The\"seven times seven,\" 49, are a transparent allegory, and an allusion to the forty-nine \"Manus,\" the Seven Rounds, and theseven times seven human cycles in each Round on each globe. The Kerkes and the Onech stand for a race cycle, andthe mystical tree Ababel -- the \"Father Tree\" in the Kuran -- shoots out new branches and vegetation at every resurrectionof the Kerkes or Phoenix; the \"Day of judgment\" meaning a \"minor Pralaya\" (See \"Esoteric Buddhism\"). The author of the\"Book of God\" and the \"Apocalypse\" believes that \"the Phoenix is very plainly the same as the Simorgh, the Persian roc,and the account which is given us of this last bird, yet more decisively establishes the opinion that the death and revivalof the Phoenix exhibit the successive destruction and reproduction of the world, which many believed to be effected bythe agency of a fiery deluge\" -- (p. 175); and a watery one in turn. \"When the Simorgh was asked her age, she informedCaherman that this world is very ancient, for it has been already seven times replenished with beings different from men,and seven times depopulated;** that the age of the human race, in which we now are, is to endure seven thousandnumbers, and that she herself had seen twelve of these revolutions, and knew not how many more she had to see.\"(Oriental Collections, ii., 119.)The above, however, is no new statement.

From these the Rabbins have borrowed theirmythos of an enormous Bird, sometimes standing on the Earth, sometimes walking in the ocean . . . while its head propsthe sky; and with the symbol, they have also adopted the doctrine to which it relates. They teach that there are to beseven successive renewals of the globe, that each reproduced system will last seven thousand years; (?) and that thetotal duration of the universe will be 49,000 years. This opinion, which involves the doctrine of the pre-existence of eachrenewed creature, they may either have learned during their Babylonian captivity, or it may have been part of the primevalreligion which their priests had preserved from remote times\" (p. 176). It shows rather that the initiated Jews borrowed,and their non-initiated successors, the Talmudists, lost the sense, and applied the Seven Rounds, and the forty-nineraces, etc., to the wrong end.Not only \"their priests,\" but those of every other country. The Gnostics, whose various teachings are the many echoes ofthe one primitive and universal doctrine, put the same numbers, under another form, in the mouth of Jesus in the veryoccult Pistis Sophia. We say more: even the Christian editor or author of Revelation has preserved this tradition andspeaks of the Seven RACES, four of which, with part of the fifth, are gone, and two have to come. It is stated as plainly ascould be stated in chapter xvii., verses 9 and 10. Thus saith the angel: \"And here is the mind which hath wisdom. Theseven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are SEVEN Kings, five are fallen, and one is,and the other is not yet come . . . . \" Who, acquainted in the least with the symbolical language of old, will fail to discern inthe five Kings that have fallen, the four Root-Races that were, and part of the fifth, the one that is; and in the other, that \"isnot yet come,\" the sixth and seventh coming root races, as also the sub-races of this, our present race?

It is the Pleiades (in Sanskrit,Krittika) who gave the god their name, for Karttikeya is the planet Mars, astronomically. As a god he is the son of Rudra,born without the intervention of a woman. He is a Kumara, a \"virgin youth\" again, generated in the fire from the Seed ofSiva -- the holy spirit -- hence called Agni-bhu. The late Dr. Kenealy believed that, in India, Karttikeya is the secret symbolof the cycle of Naros, composed of 600, 666, and 777 years, according to whether it is solar or lunar, divine or mortal,years that are counted; and the six visible, or the seven actual sisters, the Pleiades, are needed for the completion of thismost secret and mysterious of all the astronomical and religious symbols. Therefore, when made to commemorate oneparticular event, Karttikeya appeared, of old, as a Kumara, an ascetic, with six heads -- one for each century of the Naros.When the symbolism was needed for another event, then, in conjunction with the seven sidereal sisters, Karttikeya isseen accompanied by Kaumara (or Sena) his female aspect. He is then riding on a peacock -- the bird of Wisdom andOccult Knowledge, and the Hindu Phoenix, whose Greek relation with the 600 years of Naros is well-known. A six-rayedstar (double triangle) a Swastica, a six and occasionally seven-pointed crown is on his brow; the peacock's tail representsthe sidereal heavens; and the twelve signs of the Zodiac are hidden on his body; for which he is also called DwadasaKara,\" (\"the twelve-handed\"), and Dwadasaksha, \"twelve-eyed.\" It is as Sakti-dhara, however, the \"Spear-holder,\" and theconqueror of Taraka, \"Taraka-jit,\" that he is shown most famous.The years of the Naros, being (in India) counted in two ways -- either \"100 years of the gods,\" (divine years) -- or 100mortal years -- one can see the tremendous difficulty for the non-initiated in comprehending correctly this cycle, whichplays such an important part in St. John's Revelation. It is the truly apocalyptic Cycle; yet in none of the numerousspeculations about it have we found anything but a few approximate truths, because of its being of various lengths andrelating to various pre-historic events.It has been urged against the duration claimed by the Babylonians for their divine ages, that Suidas shows the ancientscounting, in their chronological computations, days for years. Dr. Sepp in his ingenious plagiarism -- exposed elsewhere -- of the Hindu 432 in thousands and millions of years (the duration of the Yugas) which he dwarfed to 4,320 lunar yearsbefore the \"birth of Christ\" -- as \"foreordained\" in the sidereal (besides the invisible) heavens, and proved \"by the"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"apparition of the Star of Bethlehem\" -- appeals to Suidas and his authority. But Suidas had no other warrant for it than hisown speculations, and he------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 620 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.was no Initiate. He cites, as a proof, Vulcan, in showing him as having, according to chronological claim, reigned 4,477years, i.e., 4,477 days, as he thinks, or rendered in years, 12 years, 3 months, and 7 days; he has 5 days in his original --thus committing an error even in such an easy calculation. (See Suidas, art. [[Heelios]].) True, there are other ancientwriters guilty of like fallacious speculations -- Calisthenes, for instance, who assigns to the astronomical observations ofthe Chaldeans only 1,903 years, whereas Epigenes recognises 720,000 years (Pliny. Histor. Natur. Lib. VII. c. 56.) Thewhole of these hypotheses made by profane writers are based upon and due to a misunderstanding. The chronology ofall the Western peoples, ancient Greeks and Romans, was borrowed from India. Now, it is said in the Tamil edition ofBagavadam that 15 solar days make a Paccham; two paccham (or 30 days) are a month of the mortals, adding that sucha month is only one day of the Pitar Devata (Pitris). Again, two of these months constitute a roodoo, three roodoo makean ayanam, and two ayanams a year -- which year of the mortals is but a day of the gods. It is on such misunderstoodteachings that some Greeks have imagined that all the initiated priests had transformed days into years!This mistake of the ancient Greek and Latin writers became pregnant with results in Europe. At the close of the past andthe beginning of this century, relying upon the purposely mutilated accounts of Hindu chronology, brought from India bycertain too zealous and as unscrupulous missionaries, Bailly, Dupuis, and others built quite a fantastic theory upon thesubject. Because the Hindus had made half a revolution of the moon, a measure of time; and because a monthcomposed of only fifteen days -- of which Quint. Curtius speaks (Menses in quinos dies descriperunt dies. Quint. Curt.LVIII., c. 9) -- is found mentioned in Hindu literature, therefore, it is a verified fact that their year was only half a year,when it was not called a day. The Chinese, too, divided their Zodiac into twenty-four parts, hence their year into twenty-four fortnights, but such computation did not, nor does it prevent their having an astronomical year just the same as ours.And they have a period of sixty days -- the Southern Indian Roodoo, to this day in some provinces. Moreover, DiodorusSiculus (Lib. I. § 26, p. 30) calls \"thirty days an Egyptian year,\" or that period during which the moon performs a completerevolution. Pliny and Plutarch both speak of it (Hist. Nat. Lib. VII., c. 48, Vol. III., p. 185, and Life of Numa, § 16); but doesit stand to reason that the Egyptians, who knew astronomy as well as any other people did, made the lunar month consistof thirty days, when it is only twenty-eight days with fractions? This lunary period had an occult meaning surely as muchas the Ayanam and the roodoo of the Hindus had. The year of two months' duration, and the period of sixty days also,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 621 VARIOUS CYCLIC CALCULATIONS.was a universal measure of time in antiquity, as Bailly himself shows in his Traite de l'Astronomie Orientale. TheChinamen, according to their own books, divided their year into two parts, from one equinox to the other (Mem. Acad. Ins.T. XVI., c. 48, Tom. III., p. 183); the Arabs anciently divided the year into six seasons, each composed of two months; inthe Chinese astronomical work called Kioo-tche, it is said that two moons make a measure of time, and six measures ayear; and to this day the aborigines of Kamschatka have their years of six months, as they had when visited by AbbeChappe (Voyage to Siberia, Vol. III., p. 19). But is all this a reason to say that when the Hindu Puranas say \"a solar year\"they mean one solar day! It is the knowledge of the natural laws that make of seven the root nature-number, so to say, inthe manifested world -- at any rate in our present terrestrial life-cycle -- and the wonderful comprehension of its workings,that unveiled to the ancients so many of the mysteries of nature. It is these laws, again, and their processes on thesidereal, terrestrial, and moral planes, which enabled the old astronomers to calculate correctly the duration of the cyclesand their respective effects on the march of events; to record beforehand (prophecy, it is called) the influence which theywill have on the course and development of the human races. The Sun, Moon, and planets being the never-erring timemeasurers, whose potency and periodicity were well known, became thus the great Ruler and rulers of our little system inall its seven domains, or \"spheres of action.\"*This has been so evident and remarkable, that even many of the modern men of Science, Materialists as well as Mystics,had their attention called to this law. Physicians and theologians, mathematicians and psychologists have drawn theattention of the world repeatedly to this fact of periodicity in the behaviour of \"Nature.\" These numbers are explained inthe \"Commentaries\" in these words.THE CIRCLE IS NOT THE \"ONE\" BUT THE ALL.IN THE HIGHER [heaven] THE IMPENETRABLE RAJAH [\"ad Mutant,\" see Atharva-Veda X., 105], IT [the Circle]BECOMES ONE, BECAUSE [it is] THE INDIVISIBLE, AND THERE CAN BE NO TAU IN IT.IN THE SECOND [of the three \"Rajamsi\" (tritiya), or the three \"Worlds\"] THE ONE BECOMES TWO [male and female];AND THREE [add the Son or logos]; AND THE SACRED FOUR [\"tetractis,\" or the \"Tetragrammaton.\"]IN THE THIRD [the lower world or our earth] THE NUMBER BECOMES FOUR, AND THREE, AND TWO.

For --\"THERE IS A HARMONY OF NUMBERS IN ALL NATURE; in the force of gravity, in the planetary movements, in thelaws of heat, light, electricity, and chemical affinity, in the forms of animals and plants, in the perception of the mind. Thedirection, indeed, of modern natural and physical science, is towards a generalization which shall express thefundamental laws of all, by one simple numerical ratio. We would refer to Professor Whewell's 'Philosophy of theInductive Sciences,' and to Mr. Hay's researches into the laws of harmonious colouring and form. From these it appearsthat the number seven is distinguished in the laws regulating the harmonious Perception of forms, colours, and sounds,and probably of taste also, if we could analyse our sensations of this kind with mathematical accuracy.\" (\"MedicalReview,\" July, 1844).So much so, indeed, that more than one physician has stood aghast at the periodical septenary return of the cycles in therise and fall of various complaints, and naturalists have felt themselves at an utter loss to explain this law. \"The birth,growth, maturity, vital functions . . . . change, diseases, decay and death, of insects, reptiles, fishes, birds, mammals, andeven of man, are more or less controlled by a law of completion in weeks,\" or seven days.** Dr. Laycock (Lancet, 1842-3), writing on the Periodicity of Vital Phenomena, records a \"most remarkable illustration and confirmation of the law ininsects.\"***[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In Hinduism, as understood by the Orientalists from the Atharvaveda, the three rajamsi refer to the three strides ofVishnu; his ascending higher step, being taken in the highest world (A. V., VII., 99, 1, cf. I 155, 5). It is the divo rajah, orthe \"sky,\" as they take it. But it is something besides this in Occultism. The sentence pareshu, guhyeshu, vrateshu, cf. I,155, 3, and IX., 75, 2; or again, verse X., 114, in Atharvaveda -- has yet to be explained.** H.

I think itimpossible to come to any less general conclusion than this, that in animals, changes occur every three and a half,seven, fourteen, twenty-one, or twenty-eight days, or at some definite number of weeks\" or septenary cycles. Again, thesame Dr. Laycock states that:-- \"Whatever type the fever may exhibit, there will be a paroxysm on the seventh day . . .the fourteenth will be remarkable as a day of amendment . . . \" (either cure or death taking place). \"If the fourth(paroxysm) be severe, and the fifth less so, the disease will end at the seventh paroxysm, and . . . change for the better .. . will be seen on the fourteenth day, [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 623 THE SEPTENATE IN PHYSIOLOGY.To all of which Mr. Grattan Guinness, the author of \"The Approaching End of the Age,\" says very pertinently, as hedefends Biblical Chronology, \"And man's life . . . is a week, a week of decades. 'The days of our years are threescoreyears and ten.' Combining the testimony of all these facts, we are bound to admit that there prevails in organic mature alaw of septiform periodicity, a law of completion in weeks\" (p. 269). Without accepting the conclusions, and especially thepremises of the learned Founder of \"the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions,\" the writer accepts andwelcomes his researches in the occult chronology of the Bible. Just as, while rejecting the theories and hypotheses ofmodern Science and its generalizations, we bow before its great achievements in the world of the physical, or in all theminor details of material nature.There is most assuredly an occult \"chronological system in Hebrew Scripture\" -- the Kabala being its warrant; there is in it\"a system of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] namely, about three or four o'clock a.m., when the system is most languid.\"(See \"Approaching End of the Age,\" by Grattan Guinness, pp. 258 to 269, wherein this is quoted.)This is pure \"sooth-saying\" by cyclic calculations, and it is connected with Chaldean astrolatry and astrology. Thusmaterialistic Science -- medicine, the most materialistic of all -- applies our occult laws to diseases, studies natural historywith its help, recognizes its presence as a fact in nature, and yet must needs pooh-pooh the same archaic knowledgewhen claimed by the Occultists. For if the mysterious Septenary Cycle is a law in nature, and it is one, as proven; if it isfound controlling the evolution and involution (or death) in the realms of entomology, icthyology and ornithology, as in theKingdom of the Animal, mammalia and man -- why cannot it be present and acting in Kosmos, in general, in its natural(though occult) divisions of time, races, and mental development? And why, furthermore, should not the most ancientadepts have studied and thoroughly mastered these cyclic laws under all their aspects? Indeed, Dr. Stratton states as aphysiological and pathological fact, that \"in health the human pulse is more frequent in the morning than in the evening forsix days out of seven; and that on the seventh day it is slower.\" (Ibid. Edinb. Med. and Surg. Journal, Jan. 1843.) Why,then, should not an Occultist show the same in cosmic and terrestrial life in the pulse of the planet and races? Dr.Laycock divides life by three great septenary periods; the first and last, each stretching over 21 years, and the centralperiod or prime of life lasting 28 years, or four times seven. He subdivides the first into seven distinct stages, and theother two into three minor periods, and says that \"The fundamental unit of the greater periods is one week of seven days,each day being twelve hours\"; and that \"single and compound multiples of this unit, determine the length of these periodsby the same ratio, as multiples of the unit of twelve hours determine the lesser periods. This law binds all periodic vitalphenomena together, and links the periods observed in the lowest annulose animals, with those of man himself, thehighest of the vertebrate.\" If Science does this, why should the latter scorn the Occult information, namely, that (speakingDr. Laycock's language) \"one week of the manvantaric (lunar) fortnight, of fourteen days (or seven manus), that fortnight"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"of twelve hours in a day representing seven periods or seven races -- is now passed?\" This language of science fits ourdoctrine admirably. We (mankind) have lived over \"a week of seven days, each day being twelve hours,\" since three anda half races are now gone for ever, the fourth is submerged, and we are now in the Fifth Race.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 624 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.weeks\" -- which is based on the archaic Indian system, which may still be found in the old Jyotisha.* And there are in itcycles of \"the week of days,\" of the \"week of months,\" of years, of centuries, and even of millenniums, decamillenniums,and more, or \"the week of years of years.\"** But all this can be found in the archaic doctrine. And if this common sourceof the chronology in every Scripture, however veiled, is denied in the case of the Bible, then the six days, and a Sabbath,the seventh, can hardly disconnect Genesis from the Puranic Cosmogonies. For the first \"Week of Creation\" shows theseptiformity of its chronology and thus connects it with Brahma's \"Seven Creations.\" The able volume from the pen of Mr.Grattan Guinness, in which he has collected on some 760 pages every proof of that septiform calculation, is goodevidence. For if the Bible chronology is, as he says, \"regulated by the law of weeks,\" and if it is septenary, whatever themeasures of the creation week and the length of its days; and if, finally, \"the Bible system includes weeks on a greatvariety of scales,\" then this system is shown to be identical with all the pagan systems. Moreover, the attempt to showthat 4,320 years (in lunar months) elapsed between \"Creation\" and the Nativity, is a clear and unmistakable connectionwith the 4,320,000 of the Hindu Yugas. Otherwise, why make such efforts to prove that these figures, which are pre-eminently Chaldean and Indo-Aryan, play such a part in the New Testament? We shall prove it now still more forcibly.Let the impartial critic compare the two accounts -- the Vishnu Purana and the Bible -- and he will find that the \"sevencreations\" of Brahma are at the foundation of the \"week\" of creation in Genesis i. The two allegories are different, but thesystems are all built on the same foundation-stone. The Bible can be understood only by the light of the Kabala. Take theZohar, the \"Book of Concealed Mystery,\" however now disfigured, and compare. The seven Rishis and the fourteenManus of the seven Manvantaras -- issue from Brahma's head; they are his \"mind-born sons,\" and it is with them thatbegins the division of mankind and its races from the Heavenly man, \"the Logos\" (the manifested), who is BrahmaPrajapati. Says (V. 70 in) the \"Ha Idra Rabba Qadisha\" (the Greater Holy Assembly) of the skull (head)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* See for the length of such cycles or Yugas in Vriddha Garga and other ancient astronomical Sections (Jyotisha). Theyvary from the cycle of five years -- which Colebrooke calls \"the cycle of the Vedas,\" specified in the institutes of Parasara,\"and the basis of calculation for larger cycles\" (Miscell. Essays, Vol. I., pp. 106 and 108) -- up to the Mahayuga or thefamous cycle of 4,320,000 years.** The Hebrew word for \"week\" is Seven; and any length of time divided by Seven would have been a \"week\" in their day,even 49,000,000 years, as it is seven times seven millions. But their calculation is throughout septiform.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 625 THE HAIRY SYMBOL.of Macroprosopus, the ancient One* (Sanat, an appellation of Brahma), that in every one of his hairs is a \"hidden fountainissuing from the concealed brain.\" \"And it shineth and goeth forth through that hair unto the hair of Microprosopus, andfrom it (which is the manifest QUATERNARY, the Tetragrammaton) his brain is formed; and thence that brain goeth intoTHIRTY and TWO paths\" (or the triad and the duad, or again 432). And again: (V. 80) \"Thirteen curls of hair exist on theone side and on the other of the skull\" -- i.e., six on one and six on the other, the thirteenth being also the fourteenth, as itis male-female, \"and through them commenceth the division of the hair\" (the division of things, Mankind and Races).\"We six are lights which shine forth from a seventh (light),\" saith Rabbi Abba; \"thou art the seventh light\" (the synthesis ofus all, he adds, speaking of Tetragrammaton and his seven \"companions,\" whom he calls \"the eyes of Tetragrammaton.\")TETRAGRAMMATON is Brahma Prajapati, who assumed four forms, in order to create four kinds of supernal creatures,i.e., made himself fourfold, or the manifest Quaternary (see Vishnu Purana, Book I. ch. V.); and who, after that, is re-bornin the seven Rishis, his Manasaputras, \"mind-born sons,\" who became later, 9, 21 and so on, who are all said to be bornfrom various parts of Brahma**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Brahma creates in the first Kalpa (day one) various \"sacrificial animals\" pasu -- or the celestial bodies and the Zodiacalsigns, and plants which he uses in sacrifices at the opening of Treta Yuga. The esoteric meaning of it shows himproceeding cyclically and creating astral prototypes on the descending spiritual arc and then on the ascending physicalarc. The latter is the sub-division of a two-fold creation, subdivided again into seven descending and seven ascendingdegrees of spirit falling, and of matter ascending -- the inverse of what takes place (as in a mirror which reflects the righton the left side) in this manvantara of ours. It is the same, esoterically, in the Elohistic Genesis (chap. i.), and in theJehovistic copy, as in Hindu cosmogony.** It is very surprising to see theologians and Oriental scholars express indignation at the \"depraved taste of the Hindumystics\" who, not content with having invented the \"Mind-born\" Sons of Brahma, make the Rishis, Manus, and Prajapatisof every kind spring from various parts of the body of their primal Progenitor -- Brahma (see Wilson's footnote in hisVishnu Purana, Vol. I., p. 102). Because the average public is unacquainted with the Kabala, the key to, and glossary of,the much veiled Mosaic Books, therefore, the clergy imagines the truth will never out. Let any one turn to the English,Hebrew, or Latin texts of the Kabala, now so ably translated by several scholars, and he will find that theTetragrammaton, which is the Hebrew IHVH, is also both the \"Sephirothal Tree\"-- i.e., it contains all the Sephiroth exceptKether, the crown -- and the united body of the \"Heavenly man\" (Adam Kadmon) from whose limbs emanate the Universeand everything in it. Furthermore, he will find that the idea in the Kabalistic Books (the chief of which in the Zohar are the\"Books of Concealed Mystery,\" of the \"Greater,\" and the \"Lesser Holy Assembly\") is entirely phallic and far more crudely"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"expressed than is the four-fold Brahma in any of the Puranas.

The first is the absolute perfect Square, or theTETRACTIS within the Circle, both abstract conceptions, and is therefore called AIN -- the Non-being, i.e., illimitable orabsolute Be-ness. But when viewed as Microprosopus, or the \"Heavenly man,\" the manifested Logos, he is the triangle inthe square -- the sevenfold cube not the fourfold, or the plane Square. For it is written in the same \"Greater HolyAssembly\" -- (83): \"And concerning this, the children of Israel wished to know in their minds, like as it is written (Exod.xvii. 7.): 'Is the Tetragrammaton in the midst of us, or the Negatively Existent One?'* (Where did they distinguish betweenMicroprosopus, who is called Tetragrammaton, and between Macroprosopus, who is called AIN, Ain the negativelyexistent?)\"**Therefore, Tetragrammaton is the THREE made four and the FOUR made three, and is represented on this Earth by hisseven \"companions,\" or \"Eyes\" -- the \"Seven eyes of the Lord.\" Microprosopus is, at best, only a secondary manifestedDeity. For, verse 1,152 of the \"Greater Holy Assembly\" (Kabala) says --\"We have learned that there were ten (companions) who entered into the Sod, ('mysterious assembly or mystery'), andthat seven only came forth\"*** (i.e., 10 for the unmanifested, 7 for the manifested Universe.)1,158. \"And when Rabbi Shimeon revealed the Arcana there were found none present there save those (sevencompanions) . . . . 1,159. And Rabbi Shimeon called them the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton, like as it is written, Zach.iii., 9, 'These are the seven eyes (or principles) of Tetragrammaton,\" ' -- i.e., the four-fold Heavenly man, or pure spirit, isresolved into Septenary man, pure matter and Spirit.Thus the Tetrad is Microprosopus, and the latter is the male-female Chochmah-Binah, the 2d and 3d Sephiroth. TheTetragrammaton is the very essence of number Seven, in its terrestrial significance. Seven stands between four and nine-- the basis and foundation (astrally) of our physical world and man, in the kingdom of Malkuth.For Christians and believers, this reference to Zaccharias and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] For, this \"Tree of Life\" is also the \"tree of knowledge of good and evil,\" whosechief mystery is that of human procreation. It is a mistake to regard the Kabala as explaining the mysteries of Kosmos orNature; it explains and unveils only a few allegories in the Bible, and is more esoteric than is the latter.* Simplified in the English Bible to: \"Is the Lord (! !) among us, or not?\" (See Exodus xvii. 7.)** See Kabala Denudata, by S. Liddell MacGregor Mathers, F.T.S., p. 121.*** Translators often render the word \"companion\" (angel, also adept) by \"Rabbi,\" as the Rishis are called gurus. The\"Zohar\" is, if possible, more occult than the Books of Moses; to read the \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" one requires thekeys furnished by the genuine \"Chaldean Book of Numbers,\" which is not extant.------------------------------------------------------------------------ [[Vol. 2, Page]] 627 THE NUMBER SEVEN IN CHEMISTRY.especially to the Epistle of Peter (I P. ii. 2-5) ought to be conclusive. In the old symbolism, man, chiefly the inner Spiritualman is called \"a stone.\" Christ is the corner-stone, and Peter refers to all men as \"lively\" (living) stones. Therefore a\"stone with seven eyes\" on it can only mean what we say, i.e., a man whose constitution or (\"principles,\") is septenary.To demonstrate more clearly the seven in Nature, it may be added that not only does the number seven govern theperiodicity of the phenomena of life, but that it is also found dominating the series of chemical elements, and equallyparamount in the world of sound and in that of colour as revealed to us by the spectroscope. This number is the factor,sine qua non, in the production of occult astral phenomena.Thus, if the chemical elements are arranged in groups according to their atomic weights, they will be found to constitute aseries of groups of seven; the first, second, etc., members of each group bearing a close analogy in all their properties tothe corresponding members of the next group. The following table, copied from Hellenbach's Magie der Zahlen, exhibitsthis law and fully warrants the conclusion he draws in the following words: \"We thus see that chemical variety, so far aswe can grasp its inner nature, depends upon numerical relations, and we have further found in this variety a ruling law forwhich we can assign no cause; we find a law of periodicity governed by the number seven.\"[[diagram]]The eighth column in this list is, as it were, the octave of the first, containing elements almost identical in chemical andother properties with those in the first; a phenomenon which accentuates the septenary law of periodicity. For furtherdetails the reader is referred to Hellenbach's------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 628 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.work, where it is also shown that this classification is confirmed by the spectroscopic peculiarities of the elements.It is needless to refer in detail to the number of vibrations constituting the notes of the musical scale; they are strictlyanalogous to the scale of chemical elements, and also to the scale of colour as unfolded by the spectroscope, although in"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"the latter case we deal with only one octave, while both in music and chemistry we find a series of seven octavesrepresented theoretically, of which six are fairly complete and in ordinary use in both sciences. Thus, to quoteHellenbach:--\"It has been established that, from the standpoint of phenomenal law, upon which all our knowledge rests, the vibrationsof sound and light increase regularly, that they divide themselves into seven columns, and that the successive numbers ineach column are closely allied; i.e., that they exhibit a close relationship which not only is expressed in the figuresthemselves, but also is practically confirmed in chemistry as in music, in the latter of which the ear confirms the verdict ofthe figures. . . . . . The fact that this periodicity and variety is governed by the number seven is undeniable, and it farsurpasses the limits of mere chance, and must be assumed to have an adequate cause, which cause must bediscovered.\"Verily, then, as Rabbi Abbas said: \"We are six lights which shine forth from a seventh (light); thou (Tetragrammaton) artthe seventh light (the origin) of us all;\" (V. 1,160) and -- \"For assuredly there is no stability in those six, save what theyderive from the seventh. For ALL THINGS DEPEND FROM THE SEVENTH.\" (V. 1,161. Kabala, \"The Greater HolyAssembly.\")The (ancient and modern) Western American Zuni Indians seem to have entertained similar views. Their present-daycustoms, their traditions and records, all point to the fact that, from time immemorial, their institutions -- political, socialand religious -- were (and still are) shaped according to the septenary principle. Thus all their ancient towns and villageswere built in clusters of six, around a seventh. It is always a group of seven, or of thirteen, and always the six surroundthe seventh. Again, their sacerdotal hierarchy is composed of six \"Priests of the House\" seemingly synthesized in theseventh, who is a woman, the \"PRIESTESS MOTHER.\" Compare this with the \"seven great officiating priests\" spoken ofin Anugita, the name given to the \"seven senses,\" exoterically, and to the seven human principles, esoterically. Whencethis identity of symbolism? Shall we still doubt the fact of Arjuna going over to Patala (the Antipodes, America) and theremarrying Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga (or rather Nargal) King? But to the Zuni priests.These receive an annual tribute, to this day, of corn of seven colours. Undistinguished from other Indians during thewhole year, on a certain day, they come out (the six priests and one priestess) arrayed in their------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 629 THE SEVEN PRIESTS OF THE ZUNIS.priestly robes, each of a colour sacred to the particular God whom the priest serves and personifies; each of themrepresenting one of the seven regions, and each receiving corn of the colour corresponding to that region. Thus, thewhite represents the East, because from the East comes the first Sun-light; the yellow, corresponds to the North, from thecolour of the flames produced by the aurora borealis; the red, the South, as from that quarter comes the heat; the bluestands for the West, the colour of the Pacific Ocean, which lies to the West; black is the colour of the nether undergroundregion -- darkness; corn with grains of all colours on one ear represents the colours of the upper region -- of thefirmament, with its rosy and yellow clouds, shining stars, etc. The \"speckled\" corn -- each grain containing all the colours -- is that of the \"Priestess-Mother\": woman containing in herself the seeds of all races past, present and future; Eve beingthe mother of all living.Apart from these was the Sun -- the Great Deity -- whose priest was the spiritual head of the nation. These facts wereascertained by Mr. F. Hamilton Cushing, who, as many are aware, became an Indian Zuni, lived with them, was initiatedinto their religious mysteries, and has learned more about them than any other man now living.Seven is also the great magic number. In the occult records the weapon mentioned in the Puranas and the Mahabharata-- the Agneyastra or \"fiery weapon\" bestowed by Aurva upon his chela Sagara -- is said to be built of seven elements.This weapon -- supposed by some ingenious Orientalists to have been a \"rocket\" (!) -- is one of the many thorns in theside of our modern Sanskritists. Wilson exercises his penetration over it, on several pages in his Specimens of the HinduTheatre, and finally fails to explain it. He can make nothing out of the Agneyastra.\"These weapons,\" he argues, \"are of a very unintelligible character. Some of them are wielded as missiles; but, ingeneral, they appear to be mystical powers exercised by the individual -- such as those of paralysing an enemy, orlocking his senses fast in sleep, or bringing down storm, and rain, and fire, from heaven. (Vide supra, pp. 427 and 428.) .. . . They assume celestial shapes, endowed with human faculties. . . . . The Ramayana calls them the Sons of Krisaswa\"(p. 297).The Sastra-devatas, \"gods of the divine weapons,\" are no more Agneyastra, the weapon, than the gunners of modernartillery are the cannon they direct. But this simple solution did not seem to strike the eminent Sanskritist. Nevertheless,as he himself says of the armiform progeny of Krisaswa, \"the allegorical origin of the (Agneyastra) weapons is,undoubtedly, the more ancient.\"* It is the fiery javelin of Brahma.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* It is.

He views the symbol from a purely natural standpoint, one perhaps a trifle toomaterialistic, because too much that of an ardent Evolutionist and follower of the modern Darwinian dogmas. Thus heshows that \"the student of Bohme's books finds much in them concerning these Seven Fountain Spirits and primarypowers, treated as seven properties of nature in the alchemistic and astrological phase of the mediaeval mysteries;\"* andadds --\"The followers of Bohme look on such matter as divine revelation of his inspired Seership.

Asecond connecting link between the Theosophy of Bohme and the physical origins of Egyptian thought, is extant in thefragments of Hermes Trismegistus.*** No matter whether these teachings are called Illuminatist, Buddhist, Kabalist,Gnostic, Masonic, or Christian, the elemental types can only be truly known in their beginnings.**** When the prophets orvisionary showmen of cloudland come to us claiming original inspiration, and utter something new, we judge of its valueby what it is in itself.

They have never claimed,\" (original inspiration,\" not even asmediums, but have always pointed, and do now point to the \"primary signification\" of the symbols, which they trace toother [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 631 THE SIDEREAL SEVEN.later thought into the earliest types of expression, and then say the ancients meant that.* Subtilized interpretations whichhave become doctrines and dogmas in theosophy have now to be tested by their genesis in physical phenomena, inorder that we may explode their false pretensions to supernatural origin or supernatural knowledge.**But the able author of the \"Book of the Beginnings\" and of \"The Natural Genesis\" does -- very fortunately, for us -- quitethe reverse. He demonstrates most triumphantly our Esoteric (Buddhist) teachings, by showing them identical with thoseof Egypt. Let the reader judge from his learned lecture on \"The Seven Souls of Man.\"*** Says the author:--\"The first form of the mystical SEVEN was seen to be figured in heaven by the Seven large stars of the great Bear, theconstellation assigned by the Egyptians to the Mother of Time, and of the Seven Elemental Powers.\"Just so, for the Hindus place in the great Bear their seven primitive Rishis and call this constellation the abode of theSaptarishi, Riksha and Chitra-Sikhandinas. But whether it is only an astronomical myth or a primordial mystery, having adeeper meaning than it bears on its surface, is what their adepts claim to know. We are also told that \"the Egyptiansdivided the face of the sky by night into seven parts. The primary Heaven was seven-fold.\" So it was with the Aryans. Onehas but read the Puranas about the beginnings of Brahma, and his \"Egg\" to see it. Have the Aryans taken the idea fromthe Egyptians? -- \"The earliest forces,\" proceeds the lecturer, \"recognized in nature were reckoned as seven in number.These became seven elementals, devils (?) or later, divinities. Seven properties were assigned to nature, as[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] countries, older even than Egypt; significations, moreover, which emanate froma hierarchy (or hierarchies, if preferred) of living wise men, mortals, notwithstanding that Wisdom, who reject everyapproach to supernaturalism.* But where is the proof that the ancients did not mean precisely that which the theosophists claim? Records exist forwhat they say, just as other records exist for what Mr. G. Massey says. His interpretations are very correct, but equallyone-sided. Surely nature has more than one physical aspect; for astronomy, astrology, and so on, are all on the physical,not the spiritual plane.** It is to be feared that Mr. Massey has not succeeded. We have our followers as he has his followers, and materialisticScience steps in and takes little account of both his and our speculations!*** The fact that this learned Egyptologist does not recognise in the doctrine of the \"Seven Souls,\" as he terms ourprinciples, or \"metaphysical concepts,\" but \"the primitive biology or physiology of the Soul,\" does not invalidate ourargument. The lecturer touches on only two keys, those that unlock the astronomical and the physiological mysteries of"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"esotericism, and leaves out the other five. Otherwise he would have promptly understood that what he calls thephysiological divisions of the living Soul of man, are regarded by theosophists as also psychological and spiritual.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 632 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.matter, cohesion, fluxion, coagulation, accumulation, station, and division and seven elements or souls to man.\"All this was taught in the esoteric doctrine, but it was interpreted and its mysteries unlocked, as already stated, withseven, not two, or at the utmost, three keys; hence the causes and their effects worked in invisible or mystic as well aspsychic nature, and were made referable to metaphysics and psychology as much as to physiology. \"The principle ofsevening\" -- as the author says -- \"was introduced, and the number seven supplied a sacred type that could be used formanifold purposes\"; and it was so used. For \"the seven Souls of the Pharaoh are often mentioned in the Egyptian texts. .. . Seven Souls or principles in man were identified by our British Druids. . . . . The Rabbins also ran the number of soulsup to seven; so, likewise, do the Karens of India. . . .\"And then, the author tabulates the two teachings -- the Esoteric and the Egyptian, -- and shows that the latter had thesame series and in the same order.(Esoteric) Indian. Egyptian.1. Rupa, body or element of form. 1. Kha, body.2. Prana, the breath of life. 2. Ba, the Soul of Breath.3. Astral body. 3. Khaba, the shade.4. Manas -- or Intelligence.* 4. Akhu, Intelligence or Perception.5. Kama -- rupa, or animal soul. 5. Seb, ancestral Soul.6. Buddhi, Spiritual Soul. 6. Putah, the first intellectual father.7. Atma, pure spirit. . . . 7. Atmu, a divine or eternal soul.Further on, the lecturer formulates these seven (Egyptian) souls, as (1) The Soul of Blood -- the formative; (2) The Soul ofBreath -- \"that breathes\"; (3) The Shade or Covering Soul -- \"that envelopes\"; (4) The Soul of Perception -- \"thatperceives;\" (5) The Soul of Pubescence \"that procreates\"; (6) The Intellectual Soul -- \"that reproduces intellectually\"; and(7) The Spiritual Soul -- \"that is perpetuated permanently.\"From the exoteric and physiological standpoint this may be very correct; it becomes less so from the esoteric point ofview. To maintain this, does not at all mean that the \"Esoteric Buddhists\" resolve men into a number of elementarySpirits, as Mr. G. Massey, in the same lecture, accuses them of maintaining. No \"Esoteric Buddhist\" has ever been guiltyof any such absurdity. Nor has it been ever imagined that these shadows \"become spiritual beings in another world,\" or\"seven potential spirits or elementaries of another life.\" What is maintained is simply that every time the immortal Egoincarnates it becomes, as a total, a com-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This is a great mistake made in the Esoteric enumeration. Manas is the fifth, not the fourth; and Manas correspondsprecisely with Seb, the Egyptian fifth principle, for that portion of Manas, which follows the two higher principles, is theancestral soul, indeed, the bright, immortal thread of the higher Ego, to which clings the Spiritual aroma of all the lives orbirths.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 633 THE \"PRINCIPLES\" IN THE EGYPTIAN METAPHYSICS.pound unit of Matter and Spirit, which together act on seven different planes of being and consciousness. Elsewhere, Mr.G. Massey adds:-- \"The seven souls (our \"Principles\") are often mentioned in the Egyptian texts. The moon god, Taht-Esmun, or the later sun god, expressed the seven nature-powers that were prior to himself, and were summed up in himas his seven souls (we say \"principles\") . . . . The seven stars in the hand of Christ in the Revelation, have the samesignificance,\" etc.And a still greater one, as these stars represent also the seven keys of the Seven Churches or the SODALIANMYSTERIES, cabalistically. However, we will not stop to discuss, but add that other Egyptologists have also found outthat the septenary constitution of man was a cardinal doctrine with the old Egyptians. In a series of remarkable articles inthe \"Sphinx\" (Munich) Herr Franz Lambert gives incontrovertible proof of his conclusions from the \"Book of the Dead\" andother Egyptian records. For details the reader must be referred to the articles themselves, but the following diagram,summing up the author's conclusions, is demonstrative evidence of the identity of Egyptian psychology with the septenarydivision in \"Esoteric Buddhism.\"On the left hand side the Kabalistic names of the corresponding human principles are placed, and on the right thehieroglyphic names with their renderings as in the diagram of F.

They call Ruach (Spirit)what we call Kama-rupa; whereas, with us Ruach would be the \"Spiritual Soul\" Buddhi, and Nephesh the 4th principle,the Vital, Animal Soul. Eliphas Levi falls into the same error.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 634 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.This is a very fair representation of the number of the \"principles\" of Occultism, but much confused; and this is what wecall the 7 principles in man, and what Mr. Massey calls \"Souls,\" giving the same name to the Ego or the Monad whichreincarnates and resurrects, so to speak, at each rebirth, as the Egyptians did, namely -- \"the Renewed.\" But how canRuach (Spirit) be lodged in Kama-rupa? What does Bohme, the Prince of all the mediaeval Seers, say?\"We find Seven especial properties in nature whereby this only Mother works all things\" (which he calls -- fire, light, sound(the upper three) and desire, bitterness, anguish, and substantiality, thus analysing the lower in his own mystic way) . . .\"whatever the six forms are spiritually, that the seventh, the body (or substantiality), is essentially.\" These are the sevenforms of the Mother of all Beings from whence all that is in this world is generated,* and again in Aurora xxiv. p. 27(quoted in Natural Genesis) -- \"The Creator hath in the body of this world generated himself as it were creaturely in hisqualifying Fountain Spirits, and all the stars are . . . God's powers, and the whole body of the world consisteth in theseven qualifying or Fountain Spirits.\"This is rendering in mystical language our theosophical doctrine. . . But how can we agree with Mr. G. Massey when hestates that --\"The Seven Races of men that have been sublimated and made Planetary (?) by Esoteric Buddhism,** may be met within the Bundahish as (1) the earth-men; (2) water-men; (3) breast-eared men; (4) breast-eyed men; (5) one-legged men;(6) bat-winged men; (7) men with tails.\" . . . Each of these descriptions, allegorical and even perverted in their later form --is, nevertheless, an echo of the Secret Doctrine teaching. They all refer to the pre-Human evolution of the water-men\"terrible and bad\" by unaided Nature through millions of years, as previously described. But we deny point blank theassertion made that \"these were never real races,\" and point to the Archaic Stanzas for our answer. It is easy to infer andto say that our \"instructors have mistaken these shadows of the Past, for things human and spiritual\"; but that \"they areneither, and never were either,\" it is less easy to prove. The assertion must ever remain on a par with the Darwinian claimthat man and the ape had a common pithecoid ancestor. What the Lecturer takes for a \"mode of expression\" and nothingmore, in the Egyptian Ritual, we take as having quite another and an important meaning. Here is one instance. Says theRitual, the \"Book of the Dead\" --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Signatura rerum xiv. ps. 10, 15 et seq.** This is indeed news! It makes us fear that the Lecturer had never read \"Esoteric Buddhism\" before criticising it, asthere are too many such misconceptions in his notices of it.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 635 MAN, THE PARENT OF ALL THE MAMMALS.\"I am the mouse.\" \"I am the hawk.\" \"I am the ape.\" . . . \"I am the crocodile whose Soul Comes FROM MEN.\" \"I am theSoul of the Gods.\" Of these last two sentences, one: \"whose soul comes from men\" -- is explained by the Lecturer, whosays parenthetically, \"that is, as a type of intelligence,\" and the other: \"I am the Soul of the Gods,\" as meaning, \"theHorus, or Christ, as the outcome of all.\"The occult teaching answers: \"It means far more.\" . . .It gives first of all a corroboration of the teaching that, while the human monad has passed on globe A and others, in theFirst Round, through all the three kingdoms -- the mineral, the vegetable, and the animal -- in this our Fourth Round,every mammal has sprung from Man if the semi-ethereal, many-shaped creature with the human Monad in it, of the firsttwo races, can be regarded as Man. But it must be so called; for, in the esoteric language, it is not the form of flesh,blood, and bones, now referred to as Man, which is in any way the MAN, but the inner divine MONAD with its manifoldprinciples or aspects.The lecture referred to, however, much as it opposes \"Esoteric Buddhism\" and its teachings, is an eloquent answer tothose who have tried to represent the whole as a newfangled doctrine. And there are many such, in Europe, America, andeven India. Yet, between the esotericism of the old Arhats, and that which has now survived in India among the fewBrahmins who have seriously studied their Secret Philosophy, the difference does not appear so very great. It seemscentred in, and limited to, the question of the order of the evolution of cosmic and other principles, more than anythingelse. At all events it is no greater divergence than the everlasting question of the filioque dogma, which since the XIIth.century has separated the Roman Catholic from the older Greek Eastern Church. Yet, whatever the differences in theforms in which the septenary dogma is presented, the substance is there, and its presence and importance in theBrahminical system may be judged by what one of India's learned metaphysicians and Vedantic scholars says of it:--"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"\"The real esoteric seven-fold classification is one of the most important, if not the most important classification, which hasreceived its arrangement from the mysterious constitution of this eternal type.

The progress of development presents some points of similarity to thegradual development of the rays of the spectrum. While the four-fold classification is amply------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 636 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.sufficient for all practical purposes, this real seven-fold classification is of great theoretical and scientific importance. It willbe necessary to adopt it to explain certain classes of phenomena noticed by occultists; and it is perhaps better fitted to bethe basis of a perfect system of psychology. It is not the peculiar property of 'the trans-Himalayan esoteric doctrine.' Infact, it has a closer connection with the Brahminical Logos than with the Buddhist Logos. In order to make my meaningclear I may point out here that the Logos has seven forms. In other words, there are seven kinds of Logoi in the Cosmos.Each of these has become the central figure of one of the seven main branches of the ancient Wisdom-religion. Thisclassification is not the seven-fold classification we have adopted. I make this assertion without the slightest fear ofcontradiction. The real classification has all the requisites of a scientific classification. It has seven distinct principles,which correspond with seven distinct states of Pragna or consciousness. It bridges the gulf between the objective andsubjective, and indicates the mysterious circuit through which ideation passes. The seven principles are allied to sevenstates of matter, and to seven forms of force. These principles are harmoniously arranged between two poles, whichdefine the limits of human consciousness.\"*The above is perfectly correct, save, perhaps, one point. The \"sevenfold classification\" in the esoteric system has neverbeen claimed (to the writer's knowledge) by any one belonging to it, as \"the peculiar property of the Trans-Himalayanesoteric doctrine\"; but only as having survived in that old school alone. It is no more the property of the trans, than it is ofthe cis-Himalayan esoteric doctrine, but is simply the common inheritance of all such schools, left to the sages of the FifthRoot Race by the great Siddhas** of the Fourth. Let us remember that the Atlanteans became the terrible sorcerers, nowcelebrated in so many of the oldest MSS. of India, only toward their fall, the submersion of their continent having beenbrought on by it. What is claimed is simply the fact that the wisdom imparted by the \"Divine Ones\" -- born through theKriyasakti powers of the Third Race before its Fall and Separation into sexes -- to the adepts of the early Fourth Race,has remained in all its pristine purity in a certain Brotherhood. The said[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Theosophist, 1887 (Madras).** According to Svetasvatara-Upanishad (357) the Siddhas are those who are possessed from birth of superhumanpowers, as also of \"knowledge and indifference to the world.\" According to the Occult teachings, however, Siddhas arethe Nirmanakayas or the \"spirits\" (in the sense of an individual, or conscious spirit) of great sages from spheres on ahigher plane than our own, who voluntarily incarnate in mortal bodies in order to help the human race in its upwardprogress. Hence their innate knowledge, wisdom and powers.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 637 AN ALLEGORY IN THE ANUGITA.School or Fraternity being closely connected with a certain island of an inland sea, believed in by both Hindus andBuddhists, but called \"mythical\" by geographers and Orientalists, the less one talks of it, the wiser he will be. Nor can oneaccept the said \"sevenfold classification\" as having \"a closer connection with the Brahminical Logos than with theBuddhist Logos,\" since both are identical, whether the one \"Logos\" is called Eswara or Avalokiteswara, Brahma orPadmapani. These are, however, very small differences, more fanciful than real, in fact. Brahmanism and Buddhism, bothviewed from their orthodox aspects, are as inimical and as irreconcilable as water and oil. Each of these great bodies,however, has a vulnerable place in its constitution. While even in their esoteric interpretation both can agree but todisagree, once that their respective vulnerable points are confronted, every disagreement must fall, for the two will findthemselves on common ground. The \"heel of Achilles\" of orthodox Brahmanism is the Adwaita philosophy, whosefollowers are called by the pious \"Buddhists in disguise\"; as that of orthodox Buddhism is Northern mysticism, asrepresented by the disciples of the philosophies of Aryasanga (the Yogacharya School) and Mahayana, who are twitted intheir turn by their correligionists as \"Vedantins in disguise.\" The esoteric philosophy of both these can be but one ifcarefully analysed and compared, as Gautama Buddha and Sankaracharya are most closely connected, if one believestradition and certain esoteric teachings. Thus every difference between the two will be found one of form rather than ofsubstance.A most mystic discourse, full of septenary symbology, may be found in the Anugita.* There the Brahmana narrates thebliss of having crossed beyond the regions of illusion, \"in which fancies are the gadflies and mosquitoes, in which griefand joy are cold and heat, in which delusion is the blinding darkness, avarice, the beasts of prey and reptiles, and desireand anger are the obstructors.\" . . . . The sage describes the entrance into and exit from the forest (a symbol for man'slife-time) and also that forest itself:**\"In that forest are seven large trees (the Senses, Mind and Understanding, or Manas and Buddhi included), seven fruitsand seven guests; seven hermitages, seven (forms of) concentration, and seven (forms of) initiation. This is thedescription of the forest. That forest is filled with trees producing splendid flowers and fruits of five colours.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. viii.

That forest is filled with trees producing flowersand fruits of three colours, and mixed. That forest is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of two colours, and ofbeautiful colours. That forest is filled with trees producing flowers and fruits of one colour and fragrant. That forest is filled(instead of seven) with two large trees producing numerous flowers and fruits of undistinguished colours (mind andunderstanding -- the two higher senses, or theosophically, 'Manas-Buddhi'). Here is one Fire (Self) here connected withthe Brahman* and having a good mind (or true knowledge, according to Arjuna Misra). And there is fuel here, namely, thefive senses (or human passions). The Seven (forms of) emancipation from them are the Seven (forms of) initiation. Thequalities are the fruits. . . . There, the great Sages receive hospitality. And when they have been worshipped and havedisappeared, another forest shines forth, in which intelligence is the tree, and emancipation the fruit, and whichpossesses shade (in the form of) tranquillity, which depends on Knowledge, which has contentment for its water, and theKSHETRAGNA (the \"Supreme SELF,\" says Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita, p. 102 et seq.) within for the Sun.\"Now, all the above is very plain, and no theosophist, even among the least learned, could fail to understand the allegory.And yet, we see great Orientalists making a perfect mess of it in their explanations. The \"great sages\" who \"receivehospitality\" are explained as meaning the senses, \"which, having worked as unconnected with the self are finallyabsorbed into it.\" But one fails to understand, if the senses are \"unconnected\" with the \"Higher Self,\" in what manner canthey be[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The English editor explains here, saying, \"I presume devoted to the Brahman.\" This would be a very poor devotion,indeed, in the accomplishment of the gradually emancipating process of Yoga. We venture to say that the \"Fire\" or Self isthe higher real SELF \"connected with,\" that is to say one with Brahma, the One Deity. The \"Self\" separates itself nolonger from the universal Spirit.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 639 THE ALLEGORY EXPLAINED.\"absorbed into it.\" One would think, on the contrary, that just because the personal senses gravitate and strive to beconnected with the impersonal Self, that the latter, which is FIRE, burns the lower five and purifies thereby the higher two,\"mind and understanding\" or the higher aspects of Manas* and Buddhi. This is quite apparent from the text. The \"greatsages\" disappear after having \"been worshipped.\" Worshipped by whom if they (the presumed senses) are \"unconnectedwith the self\"? By MIND, of course; by Manas (in this case merged in the sixth sense) which is not, and cannot be, theBrahman, the SELF, or Kshetragna -- the soul's spiritual sun. Into the latter, in time, Manas itself must be absorbed. It hasworshipped \"great sages\" and given hospitality to terrestrial wisdom: but once that \"another forest shone forth\" upon it, itis Intelligence (Buddhi, the 7th sense, but 6th principle) which is transformed into the tree -- that tree whose fruit isemancipation -- which finally destroys the very roots of the Aswattha tree, the symbol of life and of its illusive joys andpleasures. And therefore, those who attain to that state of emancipation have, in the words of the above-cited sage, \"nofear afterwards.\" In this state \"the end cannot be perceived because it extends on all sides.\"\"There always dwell seven females there,\" he goes on to say, carrying out the imagery. These females, who, according toArjuna Misra, are the Mahat, Ahamkara and five Tanmatras, have always their faces turned downwards, as they areobstacles in the way of spiritual ascension.\". . . . In that same (Brahman, the 'Self') the Seven perfect Sages, together with their chiefs, abide and again emerge fromthe same. Glory, brilliance and greatness, enlightenment, victory, perfection and power -- these seven rays follow afterthis same Sun (Kshetragna, the Higher Self). . . . Those whose wishes are reduced (unselfish). . . . whose sins (passions)are burnt up by restraint, merging the Self in the Self,** devote themselves to Brahman.

But he who understands symbolicalimagery, and hears the voice of SELF WITHIN SELF, will see in this something far higher than mere ritualism, howeveroften he may err in minor details of the philosophy.And here, we must be allowed a last remark. No true theosophist, from the most ignorant up to the most learned, ought toclaim infallibility for anything he may say or write upon occult matters. The chief point is to admit that, in many a way, inthe classification of either cosmic or human principles, in addition to mistakes in the order of evolution, and especially onmetaphysical questions, those of us who pretend to teach others more ignorant than ourselves -- are all liable to err. Thusmistakes have been made in \"Isis Unveiled,\" in \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" in \"Man,\" in \"Magic: White and Black,\" etc., etc.; andmore than one mistake is likely to be found in the present work. This cannot be helped. For a large or even a small workon such abstruse subjects to be entirely exempt from error and blunder, it would have to be written from its first to its lastpage by a great adept, if not by an Avatar. Then only should we say, \"This is verily a work without sin or blemish in it!\"But, so long as the artist is imperfect, how can his work be perfect? \"Endless is the search for truth!\" Let us love it andaspire to it for its own sake, and not for the glory or benefit a minute portion of its revelation may confer on us. For who ofus can presume to have the whole truth at his fingers' ends, even upon one minor teaching of Occultism?Our chief point in the present subject, however, was to show that the Septenary doctrine, or division of the constitution ofman, was a very ancient one, and was not invented by us. This has been successfully done, for we are supported in this,consciously and unconsciously, by a number of ancient, mediaeval, and modern writers. What the former said, was wellsaid; what the latter repeated, was generally distorted. An instance: Read the \"Pythagorean Fragments,\" and comparethe Septenary man as given by the Rev. G. Oliver, the learned mason, in his \"Pythagorean Triangle\" (ch. on \"Science ofNumbers,\" p. 179).He speaks as follows:--\"The Theosophic Philosophy counted SEVEN properties (or principles), in Man, viz.:--(1.) The divine golden Man;(2.) The inward holy body from fire and light, like pure silver;------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 641 HYPNOTISM IS -- SATANISM.(3.) The elemental man;(4.) The mercurial paradisiacal man;(5.) The martial Soul-like man;(6.) The passionate man of desires;(7.) The Solar man; a witness to and inspector of the wonders of the Universe. They had also seven fountain Spirits, orPowers of Nature.\"Compare this jumbled account and distribution of Western theosophic philosophy with the latest theosophic explanationsby the Eastern School of Theosophy, and then decide which is the more correct. Verily:--\"Wisdom hath builded her house,She hath hewn out her seven pillars.\" -- (Prov. ix, 1.)As to the charge that our School has not adopted the Seven-fold classification of the Brahmins, but has confused it, it isquite unjust. To begin with, the \"School\" is one thing, its exponents (to Europeans) quite another. The latter have first tolearn the A B C of practical Eastern Occultism, before they can be made to understand correctly the tremendouslyabstruse classification based on the seven distinct states of Pragna (consciousness); and, above all, to realize thoroughlywhat Pragna is, in the Eastern metaphysics. To give a Western student that classification is to try to make him supposethat he can account for the origin of consciousness, by accounting for the process by which a certain knowledge, throughonly one of the states of that consciousness, came to him; in other words, it is to make him account for something heknows on this plane, by something he knows nothing about on the other planes; i.e., to lead him from the spiritual and thepsychological, direct to the ontological. This is why the primary, old, classification was adopted by the Theosophists, ofwhich classifications there are many.To busy oneself, after such a tremendous number of independent witnesses and proofs have been brought before thepublic, with an additional enumeration from theological sources, would be quite useless. The seven capital sins andseven virtues of the Christian scheme are far less philosophical than even the Seven Liberal and the Seven AccursedSciences -- or the Seven Arts of enchantment of the Gnostics. For one of the latter is now before the public, pregnant withdanger in the present as for the future. The modern name for it is HYPNOTISM. In the ignorance of the seven principles,and used by scientific and ignorant materialists, it will soon become SATANISM in the full acceptation of the term."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 642]][[blank]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 643]]BOOK II. -- PART III.ADDENDA.SCIENCE AND THE SECRETDOCTRINE CONTRASTED.\"The knowledge of this nether world --Say, friend, what is it, false or true?The false, what mortal cares to know?The true, what mortal ever knew?\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 644]]-------§§ PAGEI.

But, it is estimated that 75 per cent. of European Scientists are Evolutionists. Are theserepresentatives of modern thought all guilty of flagrant misrepresentation of the facts? No one says this -- but there are afew very exceptional cases. However, the Scientists in their anti-clerical enthusiasm and despair of any alternative theoryto Darwinism, except that of \"special creation,\" are unconsciously insincere in \"forcing\" a hypothesis the elasticity of whichis inadequate, and which resents the severe strain to which it is now subjected. Insincerity on the same subject is,however, patent in ecclesiastical circles. Bishop Temple has come forward as a thorough-going supporter of Darwinism inhis \"Religion and Science.\" This clerical writer goes so far as to regard Matter -- after receiving its \"primal impress\" -- asthe unaided evolver of all cosmic phenomena. This view only differs from that of Haeckel, in postulating a hypotheticaldeity at \"the back of beyont,\" a deity which stands entirely aloof from the interplay of forces. Such a metaphysical entity isno more the Theological God than that of Kant. Bishop Temple's truce with Materialistic Science is, in our opinion,impolitic -- apart from the fact that it involves a total rejection of the Biblical cosmogony. In the presence of this display offlunkeyism before the materialism of our \"learned\" age, we Occultists can but smile. But how about loyalty to the Masterssuch theological truants profess to serve, Christ, and Christendom at large?However, we have no desire, for the present, to throw down the gauntlet to the clergy, our business being now withmaterialistic Science alone. The latter answers to our question, in the person of its best representatives \"We do notknow;\" -- yet the majority of these act as though Omniscience was their heirloom, and they knew all things.For, indeed, this negative reply has not prevented the majority of Scientists from speculating on that question, eachseeking to have his------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 646 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.own special theory accepted to the exclusion of all others. Thus, from Maillet in 1748 down to Haeckel in 1870, theorieson the origin of the human Race have differed as much as the personalities of their inventors themselves. Buffon, Bory deSt. Vincent, Lamarck, E. G. St. Hilaire, Gaudry, Naudin, Wallace, Darwin, Owen, Haeckel, Filippi, Vogt, Huxley, Agassiz,etc., etc., each evolved a more or less scientific hypothesis of genesis. De Quatrefages arranges them in two principalgroups -- one holding to a rapid, and the other to a very gradual transmutation; the former, favouring a new type (man)produced by a being entirely different; the latter teaching the evolution of man by progressive differentiation.Strangely enough, it is from the most scientific of these authorities that the most unscientific of all the theories upon thesubject of the origin of man has hitherto emanated. This is so evident, that the hour is rapidly approaching when thecurrent teaching about the descent of man from an Ape-like mammal will be regarded with less respect than the formationof Adam out of clay, and of Eve out of Adam's rib. For --\"It is evident, especially after the most fundamental principles of Darwinism, that an organized being cannot be adescendant of another whose development is in an inverse order to his own. . . . Consequently, in accordance with theseprinciples man cannot be considered as the descendant of any simian type whatever.\"*Lucae's argument versus the Ape-theory, based on the different flexures of the bones constituting the axis of the skull inthe cases of Man and the Anthropoids, is fairly discussed by Schmidt (\"Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,\" p. 290). Headmits that \"the ape as he grows becomes more bestial; man . . . more human,\" and seems, indeed, to hesitate amoment before he passes on: e.g., \"This flexure of the cranial axis may, therefore, still be emphasized as a humancharacter, in contradistinction to the apes; the peculiar characteristic of an order can scarcely be elicited from it; andespecially as to the doctrine of descent, this circumstance seems in no way decisive.\" The writer evidently is not a littledisquieted at the argument. He assures us that it upsets any possibility of the present apes having been the progenitorsof mankind. But does it not also negative the bare possibility of the man and anthropoid having had a common -- though,so far, an absolutely theoretical -- ancestor.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"The Human Species,\" p. 111, by de Quatrefages. The respective developments of the human and Simian brains arereferred to. \"In the ape the temporo-spheroidal convolutions, which form the middle lobe, make their appearance and arecompleted before the anterior convolutions which form the frontal lobe. In man, the frontal convolutions are, on thecontrary, the first to appear, and those of the middle lobe are formed later.\" (Ibid.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 647 THE FALLACIES OF MODERN SCIENTISTS.Even \"Natural Selection\" itself is with every day more threatened. The deserters from the Darwinian camp are many, andthose who were at one time its most ardent disciples are, owing to new discoveries, slowly but steadily preparing to turnover a new leaf. In the \"Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society\" for October, 1886, one can read as follows:--\"PHYSIOLOGICAL SELECTION. -- Mr. G. J. Romanes finds certain difficulties in regarding natural selection as a theoryfor the origin of adaptive structures. He proposes to replace it by what he calls physiological selection, or the segregationof the fit. His view is based on the extreme sensitiveness of the reproductive system to small changes in the conditions oflife, and he thinks that variations in the direction of greater or less sterility must frequently occur in wild species. If thevariation be such that the reproductive system, while showing some degree of sterility with the parent form, continues tobe fertile within the limits of the varietal form, the variation would neither be swamped by intercrossing nor die out onaccount of sterility. When a variation of this kind occurs, the physiological barrier must divide the species into two parts. . .. . The author, in fine, regards mutual sterility, not as one of the effects of specific differentiation, but as the cause of it.\"*"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"An attempt is made to show the above to be a complement of, and sequence to, the Darwinian theory. This is a clumsyattempt at best. The public will soon be made to believe that Mr. C. Dixon's \"Evolution without Natural Selection\" is alsoDarwinism -- expanded, as the author certainly claims it to be!But it is like splitting the body of a man into three pieces or various portions of man, and then maintaining that eachportion is the identical man as he was before; only -- expanded. Yet the author states on p. 79:-- \"Let it be clearlyunderstood that not one single syllable in the foregoing pages has been written antagonistic to Darwin's theory of NaturalSelection. All I have done is to explain certain phenomena . . . . the more one studies Darwin's works, the more one isconvinced of the truth of his hypothesis.\" (!!)And before this, on p. 48, he alludes to:-- \"the overwhelming array of facts which Darwin gave in support of hishypothesis, and which triumphantly carried the theory of Natural Selection over all obstacles and objections.\"This does not prevent the learned author, however, from upsetting this theory as \"triumphantly,\" and from even openlycalling his work[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* To this an editorial remark adds that an \"F.J.B.,\" in the Athenaeum -- (No. 3069, Aug. 21, 1886, pp. 242-3) points outthat naturalists have long recognised that there are \"morphological\" and \"physiological\" species. The former have theirorigin in men's minds, the latter in a series of changes sufficient to affect the internal as well as the external organs of agroup of allied individuals. The \"physiological selection\" of morphological species is a confusion of ideas; that ofphysiological species \"a redundancy of terms.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 648 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.\"Evolution without a Natural Selection,\" or, in so many words, with Darwin's fundamental idea knocked to atoms in it.As to Natural Selection itself, the utmost misconception prevails among many present-day thinkers who tacitly accept theconclusions of Darwinism. It is, for instance, a mere device of rhetoric to credit \"Natural Selection\" with the power oforiginating species. \"Natural Selection\" is no Entity; but a convenient phrase for describing the mode in which the survivalof the fit and the elimination of the unfit among organisms is brought about in the struggle for existence. Every group oforganisms tends to multiply beyond the means of subsistence, the constant battle for life -- the \"struggle to obtain enoughto eat and to escape being eaten\" added to the environmental conditions -- necessitating a perpetual weeding out of theunfit. The elite of any stock thus sorted out, propagate the species and transmit their organic characteristics to theirdescendants. All useful variations are thus perpetuated, and a progressive improvement is effected. But NaturalSelection, in the writer's humble opinion, \"Selection, as a Power,\" is in reality a pure myth; especially when resorted to asan explanation of the origin of species. It is merely a representative term expressive of the manner in which \"usefulvariations\" are stereotyped when produced. Of itself, \"it\" can produce nothing, and only operates on the rough materialpresented to \"it.\" The real question at issue is: what CAUSE -- combined with other secondary causes -- produces the\"variations\" in the organisms themselves. Many of these secondary causes are purely physical, climatic, dietary, etc., etc.Very well. But beyond the secondary aspects of organic evolution, a deeper principle has to be sought for. Thematerialist's \"spontaneous variations,\" and \"accidental divergencies\" are self-contradictory terms in a universe of \"Matter,Force and NECESSITY.\" Mere variability of type, apart from the supervisory presence of a quasi-intelligent impulse, ispowerless to account for the stupendous complexities and marvels of the human body for instance. The insufficiency ofthe Darwinists' mechanical theory has been exposed at length by Dr. Von Hartmann among other purely negativethinkers. It is an abuse of the reader's intelligence to write, as does Haeckel, of blind indifferent cells, \"arrangingthemselves into organs.\" The esoteric solution of the origin of animal species is given elsewhere.Those purely secondary causes of differentiation, grouped under the head of sexual selection, natural selection, climate,isolation, etc., etc., mislead the Western Evolutionist and offer no real explanation whatever of the \"whence\" of the\"ancestral types\" which served as the starting point for physical development. The truth is that the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 649 THE OCCULT AND THE MODERN DOCTRINES.differentiating \"causes\" known to modern science only come into operation after the physicalization of the primeval animalroot-types out of the astral. Darwinism only meets Evolution at its midway point -- that is to say when astral evolution hasgiven place to the play of the ordinary physical forces with which our present senses acquaint us. But even here theDarwinian Theory, even with the \"expansions\" recently attempted, is inadequate to meet the facts of the case. Theunderlying physiological variation in species -- one to which all other laws are subordinate and secondary -- is a sub-conscious intelligence pervading matter, ultimately traceable to a REFLECTION of the Divine and Dhyan-Chohanicwisdom.* A not altogether dissimilar conclusion has been arrived at by so well known a thinker as Ed. von Hartmann,who, despairing of the efficacy of unaided Natural Selection, regards evolution as intelligently guided by theUNCONSCIOUS (the Cosmic Logos of Occultism). But the latter acts only mediately through FOHAT, or Dhyan-Chohanicenergy, and not quite in the direct manner which the great pessimist describes.It is this divergence among men of Science, their mutual, and often their self-contradictions, that gave the writer of thepresent volumes the courage to bring to light other and older teachings -- if only as hypotheses for future scientificappreciation. Though not in any way very learned in modern sciences, so evident, even to the humble recorder of thisarchaic clearing, are the said scientific fallacies and gaps, that she determined to touch upon all these, in order to placethe two teachings on parallel lines. For Occultism, it is a question of self-defence, and nothing more.So far, the \"Secret Doctrine\" has concerned itself with metaphysics, pure and simple. It has now landed on Earth, andfinds itself within the domain of physical science and practical anthropology, or those branches of study whichmaterialistic Naturalists claim as their rightful domain, coolly asserting, furthermore, that the higher and more perfect theworking of the Soul, the more amenable it is to the analysis and explanations of the zoologist and the physiologist alone."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"(Haeckel on \"Cell-Souls and Soul-Cells.\") This stupendous pretension comes from one, who, to prove his pithecoiddescent, has not hesitated to include among the ancestors of man the Lemuridae; which have been promoted by him tothe rank of Prosimiae, indeciduate mammals, to which he very incorrectly attributes a decidua[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The \"principle of perfectibility\" of Nageli; von de Baer's \"striving towards the purpose\"; Braun's \"Divine breath as theinward impulse in the evolutionary history of Nature\"; Professor Owen's \"tendency to perfectibility, etc.,\" are all veiledmanifestations of the universal guiding FOHAT, rich with the Divine and Dhyan-Chohanic thought.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 650 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.and a discoidal placenta.* For this Haeckel was taken severely to task by de Quatrefages, and criticised by his ownbrother materialists and agnostics, as great, if not greater, authorities than himself, namely, by Virchow and du Bois-Reymond.**Such opposition notwithstanding, Haeckel's wild theories are, to this day, called scientific and logical by some. Themysterious nature of Consciousness, of Soul, Spirit in Man being now explained as a mere advance on the functions ofthe protoplasmic molecules of the lively Protista, and the gradual evolution and growth of human mind and \"socialinstincts\" toward civilization having to be traced back to their origin in the civilization of ants, bees, and other creatures,the chances left for an impartial hearing of the doctrines of archaic Wisdom, are few indeed. The educated profane is toldthat \"the social instincts of the lower animals have, of late, been regarded as being clearly the origin of morals, even ofthose of man\" (!) and that our divine consciousness, our soul, intellect, and aspirations have \"worked their way up fromthe lower stages of the simple cell-soul\" of the gelatinous Bathybius -- (See Haeckel's \"Present Position of Evolution\"Notes), -- and he seems to believe it. For such men, the metaphysics of Occultism must produce the effect that ourgrandest orchestral and vocal oratorios produce on the Chinaman: a sound that jars upon their nerves.Yet, are our esoteric teachings about \"angels,\" the first three pre-animal human Races, and the downfall of the Fourth, ona lower level of fiction and self-delusion than the Haeckelian \"plastidular,\" or the inorganic \"molecular Souls of theProtista\"? Between the evolution of the spiritual nature of man from the above Amoebian Souls, and the allegeddevelopment of his physical frame from the protoplastic dweller in the Ocean slime, there is an abyss which will not beeasily crossed by any man in the full possession of his intellectual faculties. Physical evolution, as modern Scienceteaches it, is a subject for open controversy; spiritual and moral development on the same lines is the insane dream of acrass materialism.Furthermore, past as well as present daily experience teaches that no truth has ever been accepted by the learnedbodies unless it dovetailed[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide infra, M. de Quatrefages' expose of Haeckel, in § ii., \"The Ancestors Mankind is offered by Science.\"** Strictly speaking du Bois-Reymond is an agnostic, and not a materialist. He has protested most vehemently against thematerialistic doctrine, which affirms mental phenomena to be merely the product of molecular motion. The most accuratephysiological knowledge of the structure of the brain leaves us \"nothing but matter in motion,\" he asserts; \"we must gofurther, and admit the utterly incomprehensible nature of the psychical principle which it is impossible to regard as a mereoutcome of material causes.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 651 AN EXCHANGE OF MUTUAL COMPLIMENTS.with the habitual preconceived ideas of their professors. \"The crown of the innovator is a crown of thorns\":-- said G. St.Hilaire. It is only that which fits in with popular hobbies and accepted notions that as a general rule gains ground. Hencethe triumph of the Haeckelian ideas, notwithstanding their being proclaimed by Virchow, du Bois-Reymond, and others asthe \"testimonium paupertatis of natural Science.\"Diametrically opposed as may be the materialism of the German Evolutionists to the spiritual conceptions of Esotericphilosophy, radically inconsistent as is their accepted anthropological system with the real facts of nature, -- the pseudo-idealistic bias now colouring English thought is almost more pernicious. The pure materialistic doctrine admits of a directrefutation and appeal to the logic of facts. The idealism of the present day, not only contrives to absorb, on the one hand,the basic negations of Atheism, but lands its votaries in a tangle of unreality, which culminates in a practical Nihilism.Argument with such writers is almost out of the question. Idealists, therefore, will be still more antagonistic to the Occultteachings now given than even the Materialists. But as no worse fate can befall the exponents of Esoteric Anthropo-Genesis than being openly called by their foes by their old and time-honoured names of \"lunatics\" and \"ignoramuses,\" thepresent archaic theories may be safely added to the many modern speculations, and bide their time for their full or evenpartial recognition. Only, as the existence itself of these \"archaic theories\" will probably be denied, we have to give ourbest proofs and stand by them to the bitter end.In our race and generation the one \"temple in the Universe\" is in rare cases -- within us; but our body and mind havebeen too defiled by both Sin and Science to be outwardly now anything better than a fane of iniquity and error. And hereour mutual position -- that of Occultism and Modern Science -- ought to be once for all defined.We, Theosophists, would willingly bow before such men of learning as the late Prof. Balfour Stewart, Messrs. Crookes,Quatrefages, Wallace, Agassiz, Butlerof, and several others, though we may not agree, from the stand-point of esotericphilosophy, with all they say. But nothing could make us consent to even a show of respect for the opinions of other menof science, such as Haeckel, Carl Vogt, or Ludwig Buchner, in Germany; or even of Mr. Huxley and his co-thinkers inmaterialism in England -- the colossal erudition of the first named, notwithstanding.

Spirit strove vainly to manifest itself in its fulness in purely organicforms (as has been explained in Part I. of this Volume), and the faculty, which had been a natural attribute in the earlyhumanity of the Third Race, became one of the class regarded as simply phenomenal by the Spiritualists and Occultists,and as scientifically impossible by the materialists.In our modern day the mere assertion that there exists a power which can create human forms -- ready-made sheaths forthe \"conscious monads\" or Nirmanakayas of past Manvantaras to incarnate within -- is, of course, absurd, ridiculous! Thatwhich is regarded as quite natural, on the other hand, is the production of a Frankenstein's monster, plus moralconsciousness, religious aspirations, genius, and a feeling of one's own immortal nature within one's self -- by \"physico-chemical forces, guided by blind Almighty Evolution\" (\"Pedigree of Man\").[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For explanation of the term Kriyasakti, see Com. 2 in Stanza 26.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 653 SCIENCE IS SILENT ON EVERY PROBLEM.As to the origin of that man, not ex-nihilo, cemented by a little red clay, but from a living divine Entity consolidating theastral body with surrounding materials -- this conception is too absurd even to be mentioned in the opinion of thematerialists. Nevertheless, Occultists and Theosophists are ready to have their claims and theories -- howeverunscientific and superstitious at first glance -- compared as to their intrinsic value and probability, with those of themodern evolutionists. Hence the esoteric teaching is absolutely opposed to the Darwinian evolution, as applied to man,and partially so with regard to other species.It would be interesting to obtain a glimpse of the mental representation of Evolution in the Scientific brain of a materialist.What is EVOLUTION? If asked to define the full and complete meaning of the term, neither Huxley nor Haeckel will beable to do it any better than Webster does: \"the act of unfolding; the process of growth, development; as the evolution ofa flower from a bud, or an animal from the egg.\" Yet the bud must be traced through its parent-plant to the seed, and theegg to the animal or bird that laid it; or at any rate to the speck of protoplasm from which it expanded and grew. And boththe seed and the speck must have the latent potentialities in them for the reproduction and gradual development, theunfolding of the thousand and one forms or phases of evolution, through which they must pass before the flower or theanimal are fully developed? Hence, the future plan, if not a DESIGN, must be there. Moreover, that seed has to be traced,and its nature ascertained. Have the Darwinists been successful in this? Or will the Moneron be cast in our teeth? But thisatom of the Watery Abysses is not homogeneous matter; and there must be something or somebody that had mouldedand cast it into being.Here Science is once more silent. But since there is no Self-consciousness as yet in either speck, seed, or germ,according to both Materialists and Psychologists of the modern school -- Occultists agreeing in this for once with theirnatural enemies -- what is it that guides the force or forces so unerringly in this process of evolution? Blind force? As wellcall blind the brain which evolved in Haeckel his \"Pedigree of Man\" and other lucubrations. We can easily conceive thatthe said brain lacks an important centre or two. For, whoever knows anything of the anatomy of the human, or even ofany animal, body, and is still an atheist and a materialist, must be \"hopelessly insane,\" according to Lord Herbert, whorightly sees in the frame of man's body and the coherence of its parts, something so strange and paradoxical that heholds it \"to be the greatest miracle of nature.\" Blind forces, \"and no design\" in anything under the Sun; when no sane manof Science would hesitate to say that, even from the little he knows and has hitherto discovered of the forces at work inKosmos, he sees very plainly------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 654 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.that every part, every speck and atom are in harmony with their fellow atoms, and these with the whole, each having itsdistinct mission throughout the life-cycle. But, fortunately, the greatest, the most eminent thinkers and Scientists of the"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"day are now beginning to rise against this \"Pedigree,\" and even Darwin's natural selection theory, though its author hadnever, probably, contemplated such widely stretched conclusions. The remarkable work of the Russian Scientist N. T.Danilevsky -- \"Darwinism, a Critical Investigation of the Theory\" -- upsets it completely and without appeal, and so doesde Quatrefages in his last work. Our readers are recommended to examine the learned paper by Dr. Bourges -- read byits author, a member of the Paris Anthropological Society at a recent official meeting of the latter -- called \"EvolutionaryPsychology; the Evolution of Spirit, etc.\" in which he reconciles entirely the two teachings -- namely, those of the physicaland spiritual evolutions. He explains the origin of the variety of organic forms, made to fit their environments with suchevident intelligent design, by the existence and the mutual help and interaction of two principles in (manifest) nature, theinner Conscious Principle adapting itself to physical nature and the innate potentialities in the latter. Thus the FrenchScientist has to return to our old friend -- Archaeus, or the life-Principle -- without naming it, as Dr. Richardson has donein England in his \"Nerve-Force,\" etc. The same idea was recently developed in Germany by Baron Hellenbach, in hisremarkable work, \"Individuality in the light of Biology and modern Philosophy.\"We find the same conclusions arrived at in still another excellent volume of another Russian deep thinker, N. N. Strachof -- who says in his \"Fundamental Conceptions of Psychology and Physiology\":-- \"The most clear, as the most familiar, typeof development may be found in our own mental or physical evolution, which has served others as a model to follow . . . .If organisms are entities . . . then it is only just to conclude and assert that the organic life strives to beget psychic life; butit would be still more correct and in accordance with the spirit of these two categories of evolution to say, that the truecause of organic life is the tendency of spirit to manifest in substantial forms, to clothe itself in substantial reality. It is thehighest form which contains the complete explanation of the lowest, never the reverse.\" This is admitting, as Bourgesdoes in the Memoire above quoted, the identity of this mysterious, integrally acting and organizing Principle with the Self-Conscious and Inner Subject, which we call the EGO and the world at large -- the Soul. Thus, gradually, all the bestScientists and Thinkers are approaching the Occultists in their general conclusions.But such metaphysically inclined men of Science are out of court and will hardly be listened to. Schiller, in his magnificentpoem on------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 655 THE ONE UNPARDONABLE SIN.the Veil of Isis, makes the mortal youth who dared to lift the impenetrable covering fall down dead after beholding nakedTruth in the face of the stern goddess. Have some of our Darwinians, so tenderly united in natural selection and affinity,also gazed at the Saitic Mother bereft of her veils? One might almost suspect it after reading their theories. Their greatintellects must have collapsed while gauging too closely the uncovered face of Nature, leaving only the grey matter andganglia in their brain, to respond to blind physico-chemical forces. At any rate Shakespeare's lines apply admirably to ourmodem Evolutionist who symbolizes that \"proud man,\" who --\"Dress'd in a little brief authority;Most ignorant of what he's most assured,His glassy essence -- like an angry ape,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,As make the Angels weep! . . . . \"These have nought to do with the \"angels.\" Their only concern is the human ancestor, the pithecoid Noah who gave birthto three sons -- the tailed Cynocephalus, the tailless Ape, and the \"arboreal\" Palaeolithic man. On this point, they will notbe contradicted. Every doubt expressed is immediately set down as an attempt to cripple scientific inquiry. Theinsuperable difficulty at the very foundation of the evolution theory, namely, that no Darwinian is able to give even anapproximate definition of the period at which, and the form in which, the first man appeared, is smoothed down to a triflingimpediment, which is \"really of no account.\" Every branch of knowledge is in the same predicament, we are informed.

Haeckel's phylogenesis is no lesslaughed at by the foes of his fantastic evolution, by other and greater Scientists, than our primeval races will be. As duBois-Reymond puts it, we may believe him easily when he says that \"ancestral trees of our race sketched in the'Schopfungs-geschichte' are of about as much value as are the pedigrees of the Homeric heroes in the eyes of thehistorical critic.\"This settled, everyone will see that one hypothesis is as good as another.

Is it that of an Evolution which starts from the beginning with sexual propagation?(2). Or that teaching which shows the gradual development of organs; their solidification, and the procreation of eachspecies, at first by simple easy separation from one into two or even several individuals. Then follows a freshdevelopment -- the first step to a species of separate distinct sexes -- the hermaphrodite condition; then again, a kind ofParthenogenesis, \"virginal reproduction,\" when the egg-cells are formed within the body, issuing from it in atomicemanations and becoming matured outside of it; until, finally, after a definite separation into sexes, the human beingsbegin procreating through sexual connection?Of these two, the former \"theory,\" -- rather, a \"revealed fact\" -- is enunciated by all the exoteric Bibles (except thePuranas), preeminently by the Jewish Cosmogony. The last one, is that which is taught by the Occult philosophy, asexplained all along.An answer is found to our question in a volume just published by Mr. S. Laing -- the best lay exponent of ModernScience.* In chapter viii. of his latest work, \"A Modern Zoroastrian,\" the author begins by twitting \"all ancient religions andphilosophies\" for \"assuming a male and female principle for their gods.\" At first sight, he says \"the distinction of sexappears as fundamental as that of plant and animal.\" . . . . \"The Spirit of god brooding over Chaos and producing theworld,\" he goes on to complain, \"is only a later edition, revised according to monotheistic ideas, of the far older Chaldeanlegend which describes the creation of Kosmos out of Chaos by the co-operations of great gods, male and female . . \"Thus, in the orthodox Christian creed we are taught to repeat \"begotten, not made,\" a phrase which is absolute nonsense,an instance of using words like counterfeit notes, which have no solid value of an idea behind them. For \"begotten\" is avery definite term which \"implies the conjunction of two opposite sexes to produce a new individual.\"However we may agree with the learned author as to the inadvisability of using wrong words, and the terribleanthropomorphic and phallic element in the old Scriptures -- especially in the orthodox Christian Bible -- nevertheless,there may be two extenuating circumstances in the case. Firstly, all these \"ancient philosophies\" and \"modern[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Author of \"Modern Science and Modern Thought.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 658 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.religions\" are -- as sufficiently shown in these two volumes -- an exoteric veil thrown over the face of esoteric truth; and --as the direct result of this -- they are allegorical, i.e., mythological in form; but still they are immensely more philosophicalin essence than any of the new scientific theories, so-called. Secondly, from the Orphic theogony down to Ezra's lastremodelling of the Pentateuch, every old Scripture having in its origin borrowed its facts from the East, it has beensubjected to constant alterations by friend and foe, until of the original version there remained but the name, a dead shellfrom which the Spirit had been gradually eliminated.This alone ought to show that no religious work now extant can be understood without the help of the Archaic wisdom, theprimitive foundation on which they were all built.But to return to the direct answer expected from Science to our direct question. It is given by the same author, when,following his train of thought on the unscientific euhemerization of the powers of Nature in ancient creeds, he pronouncesa condemnatory verdict upon them in the following terms:--"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"\"Science, however, makes sad havoc with this impression of sexual generation being the original and only mode ofreproduction,* and the microscope and dissecting knife of the naturalist introduce us to new and altogether unsuspected(?) worlds of life. . . .\"So little \"unsuspected,\" indeed, that the original a-sexual \"modes of reproduction\" must have been known -- to the ancientHindus, at any rate -- Mr. Laing's assertion to the contrary, notwithstanding.

Moreover, in the \"virginal reproduction -- germ-cellsapparently similar in all respects to egg-cells, develop themselves into new individuals without any fructifying element,\"etc., etc. (pp. 103-107).Of all which we are as perfectly well aware as of this -- that the above was never applied by the very learned Englishpopularizer of Huxleyo-Haeckelian theories to the genus homo. He limits this to specks of protoplasm, plants, bees,snails, and so on. But if he would be true to the theory of descent, he must be as true to ontogenesis, in which thefundamental biogenetic law, we are told, runs as follows: \"the development of the embryo (ontogeny) is a condensed andabbreviated repetition of the evolution of the race (phylogeny). This repetition is the more complete, the more the trueoriginal order of evolution (palingenesis) has been retained by continual heredity. On the other hand, this repetition is theless complete, the more by varying adaptations the later spurious development (caenogenesis) has obtained.\" (Anthrop.3rd edition, p. 11.)This shows to us that every living creature and thing on earth, including man, evolved from one common primal form.Physical man must have passed through the same stages of the evolutionary process in the various modes of procreationas other animals have: he must have divided himself; then, hermaphrodite, have given birth parthenogenetically (on theimmaculate principle) to his young ones; the next stage would be the oviparous -- at first \"without any fructifying element,\"then \"with the help of the fertilitary spore\"; and only after the final and definite evolution of both sexes, would he become adistinct \"male and female,\" when reproduction through sexual union would grow into universal law. So far, all this isscientifically proven. There remains but one thing to be ascertained: the plain and comprehensively described------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 660 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.processes of such ante-sexual reproduction. This is done in the Occult books, a slight outline of which was attempted bythe writer in Part I. of this Volume.Either this, or -- man is a distinct being. Occult philosophy may call him that, because of his distinctly dual nature. Sciencecannot do so, once that it rejects every interference save mechanical laws, and admits of no principle outside matter. Theformer -- the archaic Science --allows the human physical frame to have passed through every form, from the lowest tothe very highest, its present one, or from the simple to the complex -- to use the accepted terms. But it claims that in thiscycle (the fourth), the frame having already existed among the types and models of nature from the preceding Rounds --that it was quite ready for man from the beginning of this Round.* The Monad had but to step into the astral body of theprogenitors, in order that the work of physical consolidation should begin around the shadowy prototype.**What would Science say to this? It would answer, of course, that as man appeared on earth as the latest of themammalians, he had no need, no more than those mammals, to pass through the primitive stages of procreation asabove described. His mode of procreation was already established on Earth when he appeared. In this case, we mayreply: since to this day not the remotest sign of a link between man and the animal has yet been found, then (if theOccultist doctrine is to be repudiated) he must have sprung miraculously in nature, like a fully armed Minerva fromJupiter's brain. And in such case the Bible is right, along with other national \"revelations.\" Hence the scientific scorn, sofreely lavished by the author of \"A Modern"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Theosophists will remember that, according to Occult teaching, Cyclic pralayas so-called are but obscurations, duringwhich periods Nature, i.e., everything visible and invisible on a resting planet -- remains in statu quo.

The \"night\" of a planet has hardly any twilight preceding it. Itis caught like a huge mammoth by an avalanche, and remains slumbering and frozen till the next dawn of its new day -- avery short one indeed in comparison to the \"Day of Brahma.\"** This will be pooh-poohed, because it will not be understood by our modern men of science; but every Occultist andtheosophist will easily realize the process. There can be no objective form on Earth (nor in the Universe either), without itsastral prototype being first formed in Space. From Phidias down to the humblest workman in the ceramic art -- a sculptorhas had to create first of all a model in his mind, then sketch it in one and two dimensional lines, and then only can hereproduce it in a three dimensional or objective figure.

Nor would the suddendiscovery of a \"missing-link\" -- like fossil mend matters at all. For neither one such solitary specimen nor the scientificconclusions thereupon, could insure its being the long-sought-for relic, i.e., that of an undeveloped, still a once speakingMAN. Something more would be required as a final proof (vide infra, Note). Besides which, even Genesis takes up man,her Adam of dust, only where the Secret Doctrine leaves her \"Sons of God and Wisdom\" and picks up the physical manof the THIRD Race. Eve is not \"begotten,\" but is extracted out of Adam on the manner of \"Amoeba, A,\" contracting in themiddle and splitting into Amoeba B -- by division. (See p. 103, in \"The Modern Zoroastrian.\") Nor has human speechdeveloped from the various animal sounds.Haeckel's theory that \"speech arose gradually from a few simple, crude animal sounds . . . .\" as such \"speech stillremains amongst a few races of lower rank\" (Darwinian theory in \"Pedigree of Man,\" p. 22) is altogether unsound, asargued by Professor Max Muller, among others. He contends that no plausible explanation has yet been given as to howthe \"roots\" of language came into existence. A human brain is necessary for human speech. And figures relating to thesize of the respective brains of man and ape show how deep is the gulf which separates the two. Vogt says that the brainof the largest ape, the gorilla, measures no more than 30.51 cubic inches; while the average brains of the flat-headedAustralian natives -- the lowest now in the human races -- amount to 99.35 cubic inches! Figures are awkward witnessesand cannot lie. Therefore, as truly observed by Dr. F. Pfaff, whose premises are as sound and correct as his biblicalconclusions are silly:-- \"The brain of the apes most like man, does not amount to quite a third of the brain of the lowestraces of men: it is not half the size of the brain of a new-born child.\" (\"The Age and Origin of Man.\") From the foregoing itis thus very easy to perceive that in order to prove the Huxley-Haeckelian theories of the descent of man, it is not one, buta great number of \"missing links\" -- a true ladder of progressive evolutionary steps -- that would have to be first found andthen presented by Science to thinking and reasoning humanity, before it would abandon belief in gods and the immortalSoul for the worship of Quadrumanic ancestors. Mere myths are now greeted as \"axiomatic truths.\" Even Alfred RusselWallace maintains with Haeckel that primitive man was a speechless ape-creature. To this Joly answers:-- \"Man neverwas, in my opinion, this pithecanthropus alalus whose portrait Haeckel has drawn as if he had seen and known him,whose singular and completely hypothetical genealogy he has even given, from the mere mass of living protoplasm to theman endowed with speech and a civilization analo-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 662 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.gous to that of the Australians and Papuans.\" (\"Man before Metals,\" p. 320, N. Joly. Inter. Scient. Series.)Haeckel, among other things, often comes into direct conflict with the Science of languages. In the course of his attack onEvolutionism (1873, \"Mr. Darwin's Philosophy of Language\"), Prof. Max Muller stigmatized the Darwinian theory as\"vulnerable at the beginning and at the end.\" The fact is, that only the partial truth of many of the secondary \"laws\" ofDarwinism is beyond question -- M. de Quatrefages evidently accepting \"Natural Selection,\" the \"struggle for existence\"and transformation within species, as proven not once and for ever, but pro. tem. But it may not be amiss, perhaps, tocondense the linguistic case against the \"Ape ancestor\" theory:--Languages have their phases of growth, etc., like all else in nature. It is almost certain that the great linguistic familiespass through three stages.(1) All words are roots and merely placed in juxtaposition (Radical languages).(2) One root defines the other, and becomes merely a determinative element (Agglutinative).(3) The determinative element (the determinating meaning of which has long lapsed) unites into a whole with theformative element (Inflected).The problem then is: Whence these ROOTS? Max Muller argues that the existence of these ready-made materials ofspeech is a proof that man cannot be the crown of a long organic series. This potentiality of forming roots is the greatcrux which materialists almost invariably avoid.Von Hartmann explains it as a manifestation of the \"Unconscious,\" and admits its cogency versus mechanical Atheism.Hartmann is a fair representative of the Metaphysician and Idealist of the present age."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"The argument has never been met by the non-pantheistic Evolutionists. To say with Schmidt: \"Forsooth are we to haltbefore the origin of language?\" is an avowal of dogmatism and of speedy defeat.

Nor are his phylogeneticand palingenetic speculations treated in any better way by the real scientists, than are our cyclic repetitions of theevolution of the Great in the minor races, and the original order of evolutions. For the province of exact, real Science,materialistic though it be, is to carefully avoid anything like guess-work, speculation which cannot be verified; in short, allsuppressio veri and all suggestio falsi.

Occultists, render thanks to sciencefor such corroboration of our claims!** This seems a poor compliment to pay Geology, which is not a speculative but as exact a science as astronomy -- save,perhaps its too risky chronological speculations. It is mainly a \"Descriptive\" as opposed to an \"Abstract\" Science.*** Such newly-coined words as \"perigenesis of plastids,\" \"plastidule Souls\" (!), and others less comely, invented byHaeckel, may be very learned and correct in so far as they may express very graphically the ideas in his own vivid fancy.As a fact, however, they remain for his less imaginative colleagues painfully caenogenetic -- to use his own terminology;i.e., for true Science they are spurious speculations so long as they are derived from \"empirical sources.\" Therefore,when he seeks to prove that \"the origin of man from other mammals, and most directly from the catarrhine ape, is adeductive law that follows necessarily from the inductive law of the theory of descent\" (\"Anthropogeny,\" p. 392) -- his noless learned foes (du Bois-Reymond -- for one) have a right to see in this sentence a mere jugglery of words; a\"testimonium paupertatis of natural science\" -- as he himself complains, calling them, in return, ignoramuses (see\"Pedigree of Man,\" Notes).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 664 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.defects or illusions of his own coarser vision, auditory powers, and other senses. He has no right to trespass on thegrounds of metaphysics and psychology. His duty is to verify and to rectify all the facts that fall under his directobservation; to profit by the experiences and mistakes of the Past in endeavouring to trace the working of a certainconcatenation of cause and effects, which, but only by its constant and unvarying repetition, may be called A LAW. This itis which a man of science is expected to do, if he would become a teacher of men and remain true to his originalprogramme of natural or physical sciences. Any side-way path from this royal road becomes speculation.Instead of keeping to this, what does many a so-called man of science do in these days? He rushes into the domains ofpure metaphysics, while deriding it. He delights in rash conclusions and calls it \"a deductive law from the inductive law\" ofa theory based upon and drawn out of the depths of his own consciousness: that consciousness being perverted by, andhoneycombed with, one-sided materialism. He attempts to explain the \"origin\" of things, which are yet embosomed only inhis own conceptions. He attacks spiritual beliefs and religious traditions millenniums old, and denounces everything, savehis own hobbies, as superstition. He suggests theories of the Universe, a Cosmogony developed by blind, mechanicalforces of nature alone, far more miraculous and impossible than even one based upon the assumption of fiat lux out ofnihil -- and tries to astonish the world by such a wild theory; which, being known to emanate from a scientific brain, istaken on blind faith as very scientific and the outcome of SCIENCE.Are those the opponents Occultism would dread? Most decidedly not. For such theories are no better treated by real (notempirical) Science than our own. Haeckel, hurt in his vanity by du Bois-Reymond, never tires of complaining publicly ofthe latter's onslaught on his fantastic theory of descent. Rhapsodizing on \"the exceedingly rich storehouse of empiricalevidence,\" he calls those \"recognised physiologists\" who oppose every speculation of his drawn from the said\"storehouse\" -- ignorant men. \"If many men,\" he declares -- \"and among them even some scientists of repute -- hold thatthe whole of phylogeny is a castle in the air, and genealogical trees (from monkeys?) are empty plays of phantasy, they"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"only in speaking thus demonstrate their ignorance of that wealth of empirical sources of knowledge to which referencehas already been made\" (\"Pedigree of Man,\" p. 273).We open Webster's Dictionary and read the definitions of the word \"empirical\": \"Depending upon experience orobservation alone, without due regard to modern science and theory.\" This applies to the Occultists, Spiritualists, Mystics,etc., etc. Again, \"an Empiric -- One who confines himself to applying the results of his own observations\" (only)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 665 MR.

Yet the Occultist remains on his ownmetaphysical grounds, and does not endeavour to rank his knowledge, the fruits of his personal observation andexperience, among the exact sciences of modern learning. He keeps within his legitimate sphere, where he is master. Butwhat is one to think of a rank materialist, whose duty is clearly traced before him, who uses such an expression as this:--\"The origin of man from other mammals, and most directly from the catarrhine ape, is a deductive law, that followsnecessarily from the inductive law of the THEORY OF DESCENT.\" (\"Anthropogeny,\" p. 392).A \"theory\" is simply a hypothesis, a speculation, and no law. To say otherwise is only one of the many liberties takennow-a-days by scientists. They enunciate an absurdity, and then hide it behind the shield of Science. Any deduction fromtheoretical speculation is no better than a speculation on a speculation. Now Sir W. Hamilton has already shown that theword theory is now used \"in a very loose and improper sense\" . . . . \"that it is convertible into hypothesis, and hypothesisis commonly used as another term for conjecture, whereas the terms 'theory' and 'theoretical' are properly used inopposition to the term practice and practical.\"But modern Science puts an extinguisher on the latter statement, and mocks at the idea. Materialistic philosophers andIdealists of Europe and America may be agreed with the Evolutionists as to the physical origin of man -- yet it will neverbecome a general truth with the true metaphysician, and the latter defies the materialists to make good their arbitraryassumptions. That the ape-theory theme* of Vogt and Darwin, on which the Huxley-Haeckelians have composed of latesuch extraordinary variations, is far less scientific -- because clashing with the fundamental laws of that theme itself --than ours can ever be[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The mental barrier between man and ape, characterized by Huxley as an \"enormous gap, a distance practicallyimmeasurable\"! ! is, indeed, in itself conclusive. Certainly it constitutes a standing puzzle to the materialist, who relies onthe frail reed of \"natural selection.\" The physiological differences between Man and the Apes are in reality -- despite acurious community of certain features -- equally striking. Says Dr. Schweinfurth, one of the most cautious andexperienced of naturalists:--\"In modern times there are no animals in creation that have attracted more attention from the scientific student than thegreat quadrumana (the anthropoids), bearing such a striking resemblance to the human form as to have justified theepithet of anthropomorphic being conferred on them. . . . But all investigation at present only leads human intelligence toa confession of its insufficiency; and nowhere is caution more to be advocated, nowhere is premature judgment more tobe deprecated than in the attempt to bridge over the MYSTERIOUS CHASM which separates man and beast.\" \"Heart ofAfrica\" i., 520.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 666 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.shown to be, is very easy of demonstration. Let the reader only turn to the excellent work on \"Human Species\" by thegreat French naturalist de Quatrefages, and our statement will at once be verified.Moreover, between the esoteric teaching concerning the origin of man and Darwin's speculations, no man, unless he is arank materialist, will hesitate. This is the description given by Mr. Darwin of \"the earliest ancestors of man.\"\"They were without doubt once covered with hair; both sexes having beards; their ears were pointed and capable ofmovement; and their bodies were provided with a tail, having the proper muscles. Their limbs and bodies were acted onby many muscles which now only occasionally reappear in man, but which are still normally present in the quadrumana. .. . The foot, judging from the condition of the great toe in the foetus, was then prehensile, and our progenitors, no doubt,were arboreal in their habits, frequenting some warm forest-clad land, and the males were provided with canine teethwhich served as formidable weapons. . . .\"*Darwin connects him with the type of the tailed catarrhines, \"and consequently removes him a stage backward in thescale of evolution. The English naturalist is not satisfied to take his stand upon the ground of his own doctrines, and, likeHaeckel, on this point places himself in direct variance with one of the fundamental laws which constitute the principalcharm of Darwinism . . . \" And then the learned French naturalist proceeds to show how this fundamental law is broken.\"In fact,\" he says, \"in the theory of Darwin, transmutations do not take place, either by chance or in every direction. Theyare ruled by certain laws which are due to the organization itself. If an organism is once modified in a given direction, itcan undergo secondary or tertiary transmutations, but will still preserve the impress of the original. It is the law ofpermanent characterization, which alone permits Darwin to explain the filiation of groups, their characteristics, and theirnumerous relations. It is by virtue of this law that all the descendants of the first mollusc have been molluscs; all thedescendants of the first vertebrate have been vertebrates. It is clear that this constitutes one of the foundations of thedoctrine. . . . It follows that two beings belonging to two distinct types can be referred to a common ancestor, but the onecannot be the descendant of the other\"; (p. 106)."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"\"Now man and ape present a very striking contrast in respect to type.

In man they are so arranged that he is essentially a walker, while in apesthey necessitate his being a climber. . . . There is here an anatomical and mechanical distinction. . . . A glance at thepage where Huxley has figured side by side a human skeleton and the skeletons of the most highly developed apes is asufficiently convincing proof.\"The consequence of these facts, from the point of view of the logical application of the law of permanentcharacterizations, is that man cannot be descended from an ancestor who is already characterized as an ape, any morethan a catarrhine tailless ape can be descended from a tailed catarrhine. A walking animal cannot be descended from aclimbing one.\"Vogt, in placing man among the primates, declares without hesitation that the lowest class of apes have passed thelandmark (the common ancestor), from which the different types of this family have originated and diverged.\" (Thisancestor of the apes, occult science sees in the lowest human group during the Atlantean period, as shown before.) . . .\"We must, then, place the origin of man beyond the last apes,\" goes on de Quatrefages, thus corroborating our Doctrine,\"if we would adhere to one of the laws most emphatically necessary to the Darwinian theory. We then come to theprosimiae of Haeckel, the loris, indris, etc. But those animals also are climbers; we must go further, therefore, in search ofour first direct ancestor. But the genealogy by Haeckel brings us from the latter to the marsupials. . . . From men to theKangaroo the distance is certainly great. Now neither living nor extinct fauna show the intermediate types which ought toserve as landmarks. This difficulty causes but slight embarrassment to Darwin.* We know that he considers the want ofinformation upon similar questions as a proof in his favour. Haeckel doubtless is as little embarrassed. He admits theexistence of an absolutely theoretical pithecoid man.\"\"Thus, since it has been proved that, according to Darwinism itself, the origin of man must be placed beyond theeighteenth stage, and since it becomes, in consequence, necessary to fill up the gap between marsupials and man, willHaeckel admit the existence of four unknown intermediate groups instead of one?\" asks de Quatrefages. \"Will hecomplete his genealogy in this manner? It is not for me to answer.\" (\"The Human Species,\" p. 107-108.)But see Haeckel's famous genealogy, in \"The Pedigree of Man,\" called by him \"Ancestral Series of Man.\" In the \"SecondDivision\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* According even to a fellow-thinker, Professor Schmidt, Darwin has evolved \"a certainly not flattering, and perhaps inmany points an incorrect, portrait of our presumptive ancestors in the dawn of humanity.\" (\"Doctrine of Descent andDarwinism,\" p. 284.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 668 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.(Eighteenth Stage) he describes \"Prosimiae, allied to the Loris (Stenops) and Makis (Lemur) as without marsupial bonesand cloaca, but with placenta.\" And now turn to de Quatrefages' \"The Human Species,\" pp. 109, 110, and see his proofs,based on the latest discoveries, to show that \"the prosimiae of Haeckel have no decidua and a diffuse placenta.\" Theycannot be the ancestors of the apes even, let alone man, according to a fundamental law of Darwin himself, as the greatFrench Naturalist shows. But this does not dismay the \"animal theorists\" in the least, for self-contradiction and paradoxesare the very soul of modern Darwinism. Witness -- Mr. Huxley. Having himself shown, with regard to fossil man and the\"missing link,\" that \"neither in quaternary ages nor at the present time does any intermediary being fill the gap whichseparates man from the Troglodyte\"; and that to \"deny the existence of this gap would be as reprehensible as absurd,\"the great man of Science denies his own words in actu by supporting with all the weight of his scientific authority thatmost \"absurd\" of all theories -- the descent of man from an ape!\"This genealogy,\" says de Quatrefages, \"is wrong throughout, and is founded on a material error.\" Indeed, Haeckel baseshis descent of man on the 17th and 18th stages (See Aveling's \"Pedigree of Man,\" p. 77), the marsupialia and prosimiae -- (genus Haeckelii?). Applying the latter term to the Lemuridae -- hence making of them animals with a placenta -- hecommits a zoological blunder. For after having himself divided mammals according to their anatomical differences intotwo groups: the indeciduata, which have no decidua (or special membrane uniting the placentae), and the deciduata,those who possess it: he includes the prosimiae in the latter group. Now we have shown elsewhere what other men ofscience had to say to this. As de Quatrefages says, \"The anatomical investigations of . . . Milne Edwards and Grandidierupon these animals . . . place it beyond all doubt that the prosimiae of Haeckel have no decidua and a diffuse placenta.They are indeciduata. Far from any possibility of their being the ancestors of the apes, according to the principles laiddown by Haeckel himself, they cannot be regarded even as the ancestors of the zonoplacental mammals . . . and oughtto be connected with the pachydermata, the edentata, and the cetacea\"; (p. 110). And yet Haeckel's inventions pass offwith some as exact science!The above mistake, if indeed, one, is not even hinted at in Haeckel's \"Pedigree of Man,\" translated by Aveling. If theexcuse may stand good that at the time the famous \"genealogies\" were made, \"the embryogenesis of the prosimiae was"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"not known,\" it is familiar now.

But, as the French naturalist observes -- \"their(Darwin's and Haeckel's) process is always the same, considering the unknown as a proof in favour of their theory.\"(Ibid.)It comes to this. Grant to man an immortal Spirit and Soul; endow the whole animate and inanimate creation with themonadic principle gradually evolving from the latent and passive into active and positive polarity -- and Haeckel will nothave a leg to stand upon, whatever his admirers may say.But there are important divergences even between Darwin and Haeckel. While the former makes us proceed from thetailed catarrhine, Haeckel traces our hypothetical ancestor to the tailless ape, though, at the same time, he places him ina hypothetical \"stage\" immediately preceding this: \"Menocerca with tails\" (19th stage).Nevertheless, we have one thing in common with the Darwinian school: it is the law of gradual and extremely slowevolution, embracing many million years. The chief quarrel, it appears, is with regard to the nature of the primitive\"Ancestor.\" We shall be told that the Dhyan Chohan, or the \"progenitor\" of Manu, is a hypothetical being unknown on thephysical plane. We reply that it was believed in by the whole of antiquity, and by nine-tenths of the present humanity;whereas not only is the pithecoid man, or \"ape-man,\" a purely hypothetical creature of Haeckel's creation, unknown anduntraceable on this earth, but further its genealogy -- as invented by him -- clashes with scientific facts and all the knowndata of modern discovery in Zoology. It is simply absurd, even as a fiction. As de Quatrefages demonstrates in a fewwords, Haeckel \"admits the existence of an absolutely theoretical pithecoid man\" -- a hundred times more difficult toaccept than any Deva ancestor. And it is not the only instance in which he proceeds in a similar manner in order tocomplete his genealogical table; and he admits very naively his inventions himself. Does he not confess the non-existence of his sozura (14th stage) -- a creature entirely unknown to science -- by confessing over his own signature,that -- \"The proof of its existence arises from the necessity of an intermediate type between the 13th and the 14thstages\"!If so, we might maintain with as much scientific right, that the proof of the existence of our three ethereal races, and thethree-eyed men of the Third and Fourth Root-Races \"arises also from the necessity of an intermediate type\" between theanimal and the gods. What reason would the Haeckelians have to protest in this special case?Of course there is a ready answer: \"Because we do not grant the presence of the monadic essence.\" The manifestationof the Logos as individual consciousness in the animal and human creation is not accepted------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 670 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.by exact science, nor does it cover the whole ground, of course. But the failures of science and its arbitrary assumptionsare far greater on the whole than* any \"extravagant\" esoteric doctrine can ever furnish. Even thinkers of the school of VonHartmann have become tainted with the general epidemic. They accept the Darwinian Anthropology (more or less),though they also postulate the individual Ego as a manifestation of the Unconscious (the Western presentation of theLogos or Primeval Divine Thought). They say the evolution of the physical man is from the animal, but that mind in itsvarious phases is altogether a thing apart from material facts, though organism (as an upadhi) is necessary for ITSmanifestation.-------PLASTIDULAR SOULS, AND CONSCIOUS NERVE-CELLS.But one can never see the end of such wonders with Haeckel and his school, whom the Occultists and Theosophistshave every right to consider as materialistic tramps trespassing on private metaphysical grounds. Not satisfied with thepaternity of Bathybius (Haeckelii), \"plastidule souls,\"** and \"atom-souls\" are now invented by them, on the basis of purelyblind mechanical forces of matter. We are informed that \"the study of the evolution of soul-life shows that this has workedits way up from the lower stages of the simple cell-soul, through an astonishing series of gradual stages in evolution, upto the soul of man.\" (\"Present Position of Evolution,\" p. 266.)\"Astonishing\" -- truly, based as this wild speculation is on the Consciousness of the \"nerve cells.\" For as he tells us, \"Littleas we are in a position, at the present time, to explain fully the nature of consciousness,*** yet the comparative andgenetic observation of it clearly shows that it is only a higher and more complex function of the nerve cells.\" (Ibid, note22.)[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Of course the Esoteric system of Fourth Round Evolution is much more complex than the paragraph and quotationsreferred to categorically assert. It is practically a reversal -- both in embryological inference and succession in time ofspecies -- of the current Western conception.** According to Haeckel, there are also cell-souls; \"an inorganic molecular soul\" without, and a \"plastidular soul with (orpossessing) memory\". What are our esoteric teachings to this? The divine and human soul of the seven principles in manmust, of course, pale and give away before such a stupendous revelation!*** A valuable confession, this. Only it makes the attempt to trace the descent of Consciousness in man as well as of hisphysical body from Bathybius Haeckelii still more humorous and empirical, in the sense of Webster's second definition."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 671 HAECKEL CREATES SOULS.Mr. Herbert Spencer's song on Consciousness -- is sung, it seems, and may henceforth be safely stored up in the lumberroom of obsolete speculations. Where, however, do Haeckel's \"complex functions\" of his scientific \"nerve-cells\" land him?Once more right into the Occult and mystic teachings of the Kabala about the descent of souls as conscious andunconscious atoms; among the Pythagorean MONAD and the monads of Leibnitz -- and the \"gods, monads, and atoms\"of our esoteric teaching;* into the dead letter of Occult teachings, left to the amateur Kabalists and professors ofceremonial magic. For this is what he says, while explaining his newly-coined terminology:--\"Plastidule-Souls; the plastidules or protoplasmic molecules, the smallest, homogeneous parts of the protoplasm are, onour plastic theory, to be regarded as the active factors of all life-functions. The plastidular soul differs from the inorganicmolecular soul in that it possesses memory.\" (\"Pedigree of Man,\" Note, p. 296.)This he develops in his mirific lecture on the \"Perigenesis of the Plastidule, or the wave-motions of living particles.\" It is animprovement on Darwin's theory of \"Pangenesis,\" and a further approach, a cautious move towards \"magic.\" The formeris a conjecture that certain of the actual and identical atoms which had belonged to ancestral bodies \"are thus transmittedthrough their descendants for generation after generation, so that we are literally 'flesh of the flesh' of the primevalcreature who has developed into man in the later . . . period\" -- explains the author of \"The Modern Zoroastrian\" (in\"Primitive Polarities,\" etc.). The latter (Occultism) teaches that -- (a) the life-atoms of our (Prana) life-principle are neverentirely lost when a man dies. That the atoms best impregnated with the life-principle (an independent, eternal, consciousfactor) are partially transmitted from father to son by heredity, and partially are drawn once more together and becomethe animating principle of the new body in every new incarnation of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Those who take the opposite view and look upon the existence of the human soul, -- \"as a supernatural, a spiritualphenomenon, conditioned by forces altogether different from ordinary physical forces,\" . . . \"mock,\" he thinks, \"inconsequence, all explanation that is simply scientific.\" They have no right it seems, to assert that \"psychology is, in part,or in whole, a spiritual science, not a physical one.\" . . . The new discovery by Haeckel (one taught for thousands of yearsin all the Eastern religions, however), that the animals have souls, will, and sensation, hence soul-functions, leads him tomake of psychology the science of the zoologists. The archaic teaching that the \"Soul\" (the animal and human souls, orKama and Manas) \"has its developmental history\" -- is claimed by Haekel as his own discovery and innovation on an\"untrodden (?) path\"! He (Haeckel) will work out the comparative evolution of the soul in man and in other animals. . . .\"The comparative morphology of the soul-organs, and the comparative physiology of the soul-functions, both founded onEvolution, thus become the psychological (really materialistic) problem of the scientific man.\" (Cell-souls and Soul-cells,p. 137, \"Pedigree of Man.\")------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 672 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Monads. Because (b), as the individual Soul is ever the same, so are the atoms of the lower principles (body, itsastral, or life double, etc.), drawn as they are by affinity and Karmic law always to the same individuality in a series ofvarious bodies, etc., etc.*To be just, and, to say the least, logical, our modern Haeckelians ought to pass a resolution that henceforth the\"Perigenesis of the Plastidule,\" and like lectures, should be bound up with those on \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" and \"The SevenPrinciples in Man.\" Thus the public will have a chance, at any rate, of judging after comparison which of the two teachingsis the most or the least ABSURD, even from the standpoint of materialistic and exact Science!Now the Occultists, who trace every atom in the universe, whether an aggregate or single, to One Unity, or Universal Life;who do not recognize that anything in Nature can be inorganic; who know of no such thing as dead matter -- theOccultists are consistent with their doctrine of Spirit and Soul when speaking of memory in every atom, of will andsensation. But what can a materialist mean by the qualification? The law of biogenesis, in the sense applied to it by theHaeckelians -- \"is the result of the ignorance on the part of the man of science of occult physics.\" We know and speak of\"life-atoms\" -- and of \"sleeping-atoms\" -- because we regard these two forms of energy -- the kinetic and the potential --as produced by one and the same force or the ONE LIFE, and regard the latter as the source and mover of all. But whatis it that furnished with energy, and especially with memory, the \"plastidular souls\" of Haeckel? The \"wave motion of livingparticles\" becomes comprehensible on the theory of a Spiritual ONE LIFE, of a universal Vital principle independent ofour matter, and manifesting as atomic energy only on our plane of consciousness. It is that which, individualized in thehuman cycle, is transmitted from father to son.Now Haeckel, modifying Darwin's theory, suggests \"most plausibly,\" as the author of the \"Modern Zoroastrian\" thinks,\"that not the identical atoms, but their peculiar motions and mode of aggregation have been thus transmitted\" (byheredity).If Haeckel, or any other Scientist, knew more than any of them does of the nature of the atom, he would not haveimproved the occasion in this way. For he only states, in a more metaphysical language than Darwin, one and the samething. The life-principle, or life energy,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* (See \"Transmigration of the Life Atoms,\" \"Five years of Theosophy,\" p. 533-539). The collective aggregation of theseatoms forms thus the Anima Mundi of our Solar system, the soul of our little universe, each atom of which is of course asoul, a monad, a little universe endowed with consciousness, hence with memory (Vol. I., Part III., \"Gods, Monads andAtoms.\")"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 673]] THE MEANING OF SOUL WITH HAECKEL.which is omnipresent, eternal, indestructible, is a force and a PRINCIPLE as noumenon, atoms, as phenomenon. It is oneand the same thing, and cannot be considered as separate except in materialism.*Further, Haeckel enunciates concerning the Atom Souls that which, at first sight, appears as occult as a Monad ofLeibnitz. \"The recent contest as to the nature of atoms, which we must regard as in some form or other the ultimatefactors in all physical and chemical processes,\" he tells us -- \"seems to be capable of the easiest settlement, by theconception that these very minute masses possess, as centres of force, a persistent soul, that every atom has sensationand the power of movement.\"He does not say a word concerning the fact that this is Leibnitz's theory, and one pre-eminently occult. Nor does heunderstand the term \"Soul\" as we do; for, with Haeckel it is simply, along with consciousness, the production of the greymatter of the brain, a thing which, as the \"cell-soul, is as indissolubly bound up with the protoplasmic body as is thehuman soul with the brain and spinal cord.\" (Ibid.) He rejects the conclusions of Kant, Herbert Spencer, of du Bois-Reymond and Tyndall. The latter expresses the opinion of all the great men of science, as of the greatest thinkers of thisand the past ages, in saying that \"the passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of Consciousnessis unthinkable. Were our minds and senses so . . . illuminated as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of thebrain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings . . . electric discharges . . . we should be as far asever from the solution of the problem . . . The chasm between the two classes of Phenomena would still remainintellectually impassable.\" But the complex function of the nerve-cells of the great German EMPIRIC, or, in other words,his Consciousness, will not permit him to follow the conclusions of the greatest thinkers of our globe. He is greater thanthey. He asserts this, and protests against all. \"No one has the right[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In \"The Transmigration of the Life-Atoms,\" we say, to explain better a position which is but too often misunderstood:-- \"Itis omnipresent . . . . though (on this plane of manifestation) often in a dormant state -- as in stone. The definition whichstates that when this indestructible force is disconnected with one set of atoms (molecules ought to have been said) itbecomes immediately attracted by others, does not imply that it entirely abandons the first set (because the atomsthemselves would then disappear), but only that it transfers its vis viva, or life power -- the energy of motion, to anotherset. But because it manifests itself in the next set as what is called Kinetic energy, it does not follow that the first set isdeprived of it altogether; for it is still in it, as potential energy or life latent,\" etc., etc. Now what can Haeckel mean by his\"not identical atoms but their peculiar motion and mode of aggregation,\" if it is not the same Kinetic energy we have beenexplaining? He must have read Paracelsus and studied \"Five Years of Theosophy,\" without properly digesting theteachings, before evolving such theories.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 674 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.to hold that in the future we (Haeckel) shall not be able to pass beyond those limits of our knowledge that to day seemimpassable\"; and he quotes from Darwin's introduction to the \"Descent of Man\" these words, which he modestly appliesto his scientific opponents and himself: \"It is always those who know little, and not those who know much, that positivelyaffirm that this or that problem will never be solved by Science.\"The world may rest satisfied. That day is not far off when the \"thrice great\" Haeckel will have shown (to his ownsatisfaction) that the consciousness of Sir I. Newton was, physiologically speaking, but the reflex action (or minusconsciousness) caused by the peri-genesis of the plastidules of our common ancestor and old friend, the MoneronHaeckelii. The fact that the said \"Bathybius\" has been found out and exposed as a pretender simulating the organicsubstance it was not; and since, among the children of men, Lot's wife alone (and even this, only after her disagreeablemetamorphosis into a salt pillar) could claim the pinch of salt it is, as her forefather -- will not dismay him at all. He will goon asserting, as coolly as he has always done, that it was no more than the peculiar mode and motion of the ghost of thelong-vanished atoms of our \"Father Bathybius,\" which, transmitted across aeons of time into the cell-tissue of the greymatter of the brains of every great man, caused Sophocles and AEschylus, as well as Shakespeare, to write theirtragedies, Newton, his \"Principia,\" Humboldt, his \"Cosmos,\" etc. etc. It prompted Haeckel to invent Graeco-Latin namesthree inches long, pretending to mean a good deal, and meaning -- nothing.Of course we are quite aware that the true, honest evolutionist agrees with us; and that he is the first to say that not onlyis the geological record imperfect, but that there are enormous gaps in the series of hitherto discovered fossils, which cannever be filled. He will tell us, moreover, that \"no evolutionist assumes that man is descended from any existing ape orany extinct ape either,\" but that man and apes originated probably aeons back, in some common root stock. Still, as deQuatrefages points out, he will claim as an evidence corroborating his (the evolutionist's) claim, even this wealth ofabsent proofs, saying that \"all living forms have not been preserved in the fossil series, the chances of preservation beingfew and far between,\" even primitive man \"burying or burning his dead\" (A. Wilson). This is just what we ourselves claim.It is just as possible that future should have in store for us the discovery of the giant skeleton of an Atlantean, 30ft. high,as the fossil of a pithecoid \"missing link\": only the former is more probable.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 675 DRYOPITHECUS, THE MISSING LINK.§ III.THE FOSSIL RELICS OF MAN AND THE ANTHROPOID APE.-------"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"A.GEOLOGICAL FACTS BEARING ON THE QUESTION OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP.THE data derived from scientific research as to \"primeval man\" and the ape lend no countenance to theories deriving theformer from the latter. \"Where, then, must we look for primeval man?\" still queries Mr. Huxley, after having vainlysearched for him in the very depths of the quaternary strata. \"Was the oldest Homo sapiens Pliocene or Miocene, or yetmore ancient?

Meanwhile, in his eagerness to vindicate Mr.Darwin's Descent of Man, Mr. Boyd Dawkins believes he has all but found the \"missing link\" -- in theory. It was due totheologians more than to geologists that, till nearly 1860, man had been considered a relic no older than the Adamicorthodox 6,000 years. As Karma would have it though, it was left to a French Abbe -- l'abbe Bourgeois -- to give thiseasy-going theory even a worse blow than had been given to it by the discoveries of Boucher de Perthes. Everyoneknows that the Abbe discovered and brought to light good evidence that man already existed during the Miocene period;for flints of undeniably human making were excavated from Miocene strata. In the words of the author of \"ModernScience and Modern Thought\":--\"They must either have been chipped by man, or, as Mr. Boyd Dawkins supposes, by the Dryopithecus or some otheranthropoid ape which had a dose of intelligence so much superior to the gorilla, or chimpanzee, as to be able to fabricatetools. But in this case the problem would be solved and the missing link discovered, for such an ape might well have beenthe ancestor of Palaeolithic man.\"Or -- the descendant of Eocene Man, which is a variant offered to the theory. Meanwhile, the Dryopithecus with such finemental endowments is yet to be discovered. On the other hand, Neolithic and even Palaeolithic man having become anabsolute certainty, -- and, as the same author justly observes: \"If 100,000,000 years have elapsed since------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 676 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the earth became sufficiently solidified to support vegetable and animal life, the Tertiary period may have lasted for5,000,000; or for 10,000,000 years, if the life-sustaining order of things has lasted, as Lyell supposes, for at least200,000,000 years\" -- why should not another theory be tried? Let us carry man, as an hypothesis, to the close ofMesozoic times -- admitting argumenti causa that the (much more recent) higher apes then existed! This would allowample time to man and the modern apes to have diverged from the mythical \"ape more anthropoid,\" and even for thelatter to have degenerated into those that are found mimicking man in using \"branches of trees as clubs, and crackingcocoa-nuts with hammer and stones.\"* Some savage tribes of hillmen in India build their abodes on trees, just as thegorillas build their dens. The question, which of the two, the beast or the man, has become the imitator of the other, isscarcely an open one, even granting Mr. Boyd Dawkins' theory. The fanciful character of his hypothesis, is, however,generally admitted. It is argued that while in the Pliocene and Miocene periods there were true apes and baboons, andman was undeniably contemporaneous with the former of those times -- though as we see orthodox anthropology stillhesitates in the teeth of facts to place him in the era of the Dryopithecus, which latter \"has been considered by someanatomists as in some respects superior to the chimpanzee or the gorilla\" -- yet, in the Eocene there have been no otherfossil primates unearthed and no pithecoid stocks found save a few extinct lemurian forms. And we find it also hinted thatthe Dryopithecus may have been the \"missing link,\" though the brain of the creature no more warrants the theory thandoes the brain of the modern gorilla. (Vide also Gaudry's speculations.)Now we would ask who among the Scientists is ready to prove that there was no man in existence in the early Tertiaryperiod? What is it that prevented his presence? Hardly thirty years ago his existence any farther back than 6, or 7,000years was indignantly denied. Now he is refused admission into the Eocene age. Next century it may become a questionwhether man was not contemporary with the \"flying Dragons;\" the pterodactyl, the plesiosaurus and iguanodon, etc., etc.Let us listen, however, to the echo of Science.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This the way primitive man must have acted? We do not know of men, not even of savages, in our age, who are knownto have imitated the apes who live side by side with them in the forests of America and the islands. We do know of largeapes who, tamed and living in houses, will mimic men to the length of donning hats and coats. The writer had personallya chimpanzee who, without being taught, opened a newspaper and pretended to read in it.

Still he is essentially a man, and separated by a wide gulf from the chimpanzee or the gorilla.Even the idiot or cretin, whose brain is no larger and intelligence no greater than that of the chimpanzee, is an arrestedman, not an ape.\"\"If, therefore, the Darwinian theory holds good in the case of man and ape, we must go back to some common ancestorfrom whom both may have originated . . . . But to establish this as a fact and not a theory we require to find that ancestralform, or, at any rate, some intermediate forms tending towards it . . . . in other words . . . . the missing link! Now it must beadmitted that, hitherto, not only have no such missing links been discovered, but the oldest known human sculls andskeletons which date from the Glacial period, and are probably at least 100,000 years old, show no very decidedapproximation towards any such pre-human type. On the contrary, one of the oldest types, that of the men of thesepulchral cave of Cro-Magnon,* is that of a fine race, tall in stature, large in brain, and on the whole superior to many ofthe existing races of mankind. The reply of course is that the time is insufficient, and if man and the ape had a commonancestor, that as a highly developed anthropoid ape, certainly, and man, probably, already existed in the Miocene period,such ancestor must be sought still further back at a distance compared with which the whole Quaternary period sinks intoinsignificance . . . . It may well make us hesitate before we admit that man . . . is alone an exception. . . . This is moredifficult to believe, as the ape family which man (?) so closely resembles . . . . contains numerous branches whichgraduate into one another, but the extremes of which differ more widely than man does from the highest of the apeseries. If a special creation is required for man, must there not have been special creations for the chimpanzee, thegorilla, the orang, and for at least 100 different species of ape and monkeys which are all built on the same lines?\" (p.182, \"Modern Science, etc.\")There was a \"special creation\" for man, and a \"special creation\" for the ape, his progeny; only on other lines than everbargained for by Science. Albert Gaudry and others give some weighty reasons why man cannot be regarded as thecrown of an ape-stock. When one finds that not only was the \"primeval savage\" (?) a reality in the Miocene times, butthat, as de Mortillet shows, the flint relics he has left behind him were splintered by fire in that remote epoch; when welearn that the Dryopithecus, alone of the anthropoids, appears in those strata, what is the natural inference? That theDarwinians are in a quandary. The very manlike Gibbon is still in the same low grade of development, as it was when itco-existed with Man at the close of the Glacial Period. It has not appreciably altered since the Pliocene times. Now thereis little to choose between the Dryopithecus and the existing anthropoids -- gibbon, gorilla, etc. If, then, the Darwiniantheory is all-sufficient, how are we to \"explain\" the evolution of this[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* A race which MM. de Quatrefages and Hamy regard as a branch of the same stock whence the Canary IslandGuanches sprung -- offshoots of the Atlanteans, in short.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 679 MATERIALISM IS PUZZLED.ape into Man during the first half of the Miocene? The time is far too short for such a theoretical transformation. Theextreme slowness with which variation in species supervenes renders the thing inconceivable -- more especially on theNatural Selection hypothesis. The enormous mental and structural gulf between a savage acquainted with fire and themode of kindling it, and a brutal anthropoid, is too much to bridge even in idea, during so contracted a period. Let theEvolutionists push back the process into the preceding Eocene, if they prefer to do so; let them even trace both Man andDryopithecus to a common ancestor; the unpleasant consideration has, nevertheless, to be faced that in Eocene stratathe anthropoid fossils are as conspicuous by their absence, as is the fabulous pithecanthropus of Haeckel. Is an exit outof this cul de sac to be found by an appeal to the \"unknown,\" and a reference with Darwin to the \"imperfection of thegeological record\"? So be it; but the same right of appeal must be accorded equally to the Occultists, instead of remaining"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"the monopoly of puzzled materialism. Physical man, we say, existed before the first bed of the Cretaceous rocks wasdeposited. In the early part of the Tertiary Age, the most brilliant civilization the world has ever known flourished at aperiod when the Haeckelian man-ape is conceived to have roamed through the primeval forests, and Mr. Grant Allen'sputative ancestor to have swung himself from bough to bough with his hairy mates, the degenerated Liliths of the ThirdRace Adam. Yet there were no anthropoid apes in the brighter days of the civilization of the Fourth Race; but Karma is amysterious law, and no respecter of persons. The monsters bred in sin and shame by the Atlantean giants, \"blurredcopies\" of their bestial sires, and hence of modern man (Huxley), now mislead and overwhelm with error the speculativeAnthropologist of European Science.Where did the first men live? Some Darwinists say in Western Africa, some in Southern Asia, others, again, believe in anindependent origin of human stocks in Asia and America from a Simian ancestry (Vogt). Haeckel, however, advancesgaily to the charge. Starting from his \"prosimiae\" . . . \"the ancestor common to all other catarrhini, including man\" -- a\"link\" now, however, disposed of for good by recent anatomical discoveries! -- he endeavours to find a habitat for theprimeval Pithecanthropus alalus. \"In all probability it (the transformation of animal into man) occurred in Southern Asia, inwhich region many evidences are forthcoming that here was the original home of the different species of men. ProbablySouthern Asia itself was not the earliest cradle of the human race, but LEMURIA, a continent that lay to the south of Asia,and sank later on beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean.

Only, if it is provedthat Easter Island is an actual relic of Lemuria, we must believe that according to Haeckel the \"dumb ape-men,\" justremoved from a brutal mammalian monster, built the gigantic portrait-statues, some of which are now in the BritishMuseum. Critics are mistaken in terming Haeckelian doctrines \"abominable, revolutionary, immoral\" -- though materialismis the legitimate outcome of the ape-ancestor myth -- they are simply too absurd to demand disproof.-------B.WESTERN EVOLUTIONISM: THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF MAN AND THE ANTHROPOID IN NO WAY ACONFIRMATION OF DARWINISM.We are told that while every other heresy against modern science may be disregarded, this, our denial of the Darwiniantheory as applied to Man, will be the one \"unpardonable\" sin. The Evolutionists stand firm as rock on the evidence ofsimilarity of structure between the ape and the man. The anatomical evidence, it is urged, is quite overpowering in thiscase; it is bone for bone, and muscle for muscle, even the brain conformation being very much the same.Well, what of that? All this was known before King Herod; and the writers of the Ramayana, the poets who sang theprowess and valour of Hanuman, the monkey-God, \"whose feats were great and Wisdom never rivalled,\" must haveknown as much about his anatomy and brain as does any Haeckel or Huxley in our modern day. Volumes upon volumeswere written upon this similarity, in antiquity as in more modern times. Therefore, there is nothing new whatever given tothe world or to philosophy, in such volumes as Mivart's \"Man and Apes,\" or Messrs. Fiske and Huxley's defence ofDarwinism. But what are those crucial proofs of man's descent from a pithecoid ancestor? If the Darwinian theory is notthe true one -- we are told -- if man and ape do not descend from a common ancestor, then we are called upon to explainthe reason of:--(I.) The similarity of structure between the two; the fact that the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 681]] HUXLEY CALLS THE DARWINISTS TO ORDER.higher animal world -- man and beast -- is physically of one type or pattern.(II.) The presence of rudimentary organs in man, i.e., traces of former organs now atrophied by disuse. Some of theseorgans, it is asserted, could not have had any scope for employment, except for a semi-animal, semi-arboreal monster.Why, again, do we find in Man those \"rudimentary\" organs (as useless as its rudimentary wing is to the Apteryx ofAustralia), the vermiform appendix of the coecum, the ear muscles,* the \"rudimentary tail\" (with which children are stillsometimes born), etc., etc.?Such is the war cry; and the cackle of the smaller fry among the Darwinians is louder, if possible, than even that of thescientific Evolutionists themselves!Furthermore, the latter themselves -- with their great leader Mr. Huxley, and such eminent zoologists as Mr. Romanesand others -- while defending the Darwinian theory, are the first to confess the almost insuperable difficulties in the way ofits final demonstration. And there are as great men of science as the above-named, who deny, most emphatically, theuncalled-for assumption, and loudly denounce the unwarrantable exaggerations on the question of this supposedsimilarity. It is sufficient to glance at the works of Broca, Gratiolet, of Owen, Pruner-Bey, and finally, at the last great workof de Quatrefages, \"Introduction a l'Etude des Races humaines, Questions generales,\" to discover the fallacy of theEvolutionists. We may say more: the exaggerations concerning such similarity of structure between man and theanthropomorphous ape have become so glaring and absurd of late, that even Mr. Huxley found himself forced to protest"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"against the too sanguine expectations. It was that great anatomist personally who called the \"smaller fry\" to order, bydeclaring in one of his articles that the differences in the structure of the human body and that of the highestanthropomorphous pithecoid, were not only far from being trifling and unimportant, but were, on the contrary, very greatand suggestive: \"each of the bones of the gorilla has its own specific impress on it that distinguishes it from a similarhuman bone.\" Among the existing creatures there is not one single intermediate form that could fill the gap between manand the ape. To ignore that gap, he added, \"was as uncalled-for as it was absurd.\"**[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Professor Owen believes that these muscles -- the attollens, retrahens, and attrahens aurem -- were actively functioningin men of the Stone Age. This may or may not be the case. The question falls under the ordinary \"occult\" explanation, andinvolves no postulate of an \"animal progenitor\" to solve it.** Quoted in the Review of the \"Introduction a l'Etude des Races Humaines,\" by de Quatrefages. We have not Mr.Huxley's work at hand to quote from. Or to cite another good authority:-- \"We find one of the most man-like apes (gibbon),in the [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 682 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Finally, the absurdity of such an unnatural descent of man is so palpable in the face of all the proofs and evidence of theskull of the pithecoid as compared to that of man, that even de Quatrefages resorted unconsciously to our esoteric theoryby saying that it is rather the apes that can claim descent from man than vice versa. As proven by Gratiolet, with regard tothe cavities of the brain of the anthropoids, in which species that organ develops in an inverse ratio to what would be thecase were the corresponding organs in man really the product of the development of the said organs in the apes -- thesize of the human skull and its brain, as well as the cavities, increase with the individual development of man. His intellectdevelops and increases with age, while his facial bones and jaws diminish and straighten, thus being more and morespiritualized: whereas with the ape it is the reverse. In its youth the anthropoid is far more intelligent and good-natured,while with age it becomes duller; and, as its skull recedes and seems to diminish as it grows, its facial bones and jawsdevelop, the brain being finally crushed, and thrown entirely back, to make with every day more room for the animal type.The organ of thought -- the brain -- recedes and diminishes, entirely conquered and replaced by that of the wild beast --the jaw apparatus.Thus, as wittily remarked in the French work, a gorilla would have a perfect right to address an Evolutionist, claiming itsright of descent from himself. It would say to him, \"We, anthropoid apes, form a retrogressive departure from the humantype, and therefore our development and evolution are expressed by a transition from a human-like to an animal-likestructure of organism; but in what way could you, men, descend from us -- how can you form a continuation of ourgenus? For, to make this possible, your organization would have to differ still more than ours does from the humanstructure, it would have to approach still closer to that of the beast than ours does; and in such a case justice demandsthat you should give up to us your place in nature. You are lower than we are, once that you insist on tracing yourgenealogy from our kind; for the structure of our organization and its development are such that we are unable togenerate forms of a higher organization than our own.\"This is where the Occult Sciences agree entirely with de Quatre-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] tertiary period, and this species is still in the same low grade, and side by sidewith it at the end of the Ice-period, man is found in the same high grade as to-day, the ape not having approximated morenearly to the man, and modern man not having become further removed from the ape than the first (fossil) man . . . thesefacts contradict a theory of constant progressive development.\" (Pfaff.) When, according to Vogt, the the averageAustralian brain = 99.35 cub. inches; that of the gorilla 30.51 cub. in., and that of the chimpanzee only 25.45, the giantgap to be bridged by the advocate of \"Natural\" Selection becomes apparent.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 683 THE DARWINISTS AND THEIR OPPONENTS.fages. Owing to the very type of his development man cannot descend from either an ape or an ancestor common toboth, but shows his origin from a type far superior to himself. And this type is the \"Heavenly man\" -- the Dhyan Chohans,or the Pitris so-called, as shown in the first Part of this volume. On the other hand, the pithecoids, the orang-outang, thegorilla, and the chimpanzee can, and, as the Occult Sciences teach, do, descend from the animalized Fourth humanRoot-Race, being the product of man and an extinct species of mammal -- whose remote ancestors were themselves theproduct of Lemurian bestiality -- which lived in the Miocene age. The ancestry of this semi-human monster is explained inthe Stanzas as originating in the sin of the \"Mind-less\" races of the middle Third Race period.When it is borne in mind that all forms which now people the earth, are so many variations on basic types originallythrown off by the MAN of the Third and Fourth Round, such an evolutionist argument as that insisting on the \"unity ofstructural plan\" characterising all vertebrates, loses its edge. The basic types referred to were very few in number incomparison with the multitude of organisms to which they ultimately gave rise; but a general unity of type has,nevertheless, been preserved throughout the ages. The economy of Nature does not sanction the co-existence of severalutterly opposed \"ground plans\" of organic evolution on one planet. Once, however, that the general drift of the occultexplanation is formulated, inference as to detail may well be left to the intuitive reader.Similarly with the important question of the \"rudimentary\" organs discovered by anatomists in the human organism.Doubtless this line of argument, when wielded by Darwin and Haeckel against their European adversaries, proved ofgreat weight. Anthropologists, who ventured to dispute the derivation of man from an animal ancestry, were sorelypuzzled how to deal with the presence of gill-clefts, with the \"tail\" problem, and so on. Here again Occultism comes to ourassistance with the necessary data."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"The fact is that, as previously stated, the human type is the repertory of all potential organic forms, and the central pointfrom which these latter radiate. In this postulate we find a true \"Evolution\" or \"Unfolding\" -- a sense which cannot be saidto belong to the mechanical theory of natural selection. Criticising Darwin's inference from \"rudiments,\" an able writerremarks: \"Why is it not just as probably a true hypothesis to suppose that Man was created with the rudimentary sketchesin his organization, and that they became useful appendages in the lower animals into which man degenerated, as tosuppose that these parts existed in full development in the lower animals out of which man was generated?\" (\"Creation orEvolution?\" Geo.

But a wider generalization is now to be formulated.So far as our present Fourth Round terrestrial period is concerned, the mammalian fauna are alone to be regarded astraceable to prototypes shed by Man. The amphibia, birds, reptiles, fishes, etc., are the resultants of the Third Round,astral fossil forms stored up in the auric envelope of the Earth and projected into physical objectivity subsequent to thedeposition of the first Laurentian rocks. \"Evolution\" has to deal with the progressive modifications, which palaeontologyshows to have affected the lower animal and vegetable kingdoms in the course of geological time. It does not, and fromthe nature of things cannot, touch on the subject of the pre-physical types which served as the basis for futuredifferentiation. Tabulate the general laws controlling the development of physical organisms it certainly may, and to acertain extent it has acquitted itself ably of the task.To return to the immediate subject of discussion. The mammalia, whose first traces are discovered in the marsupials ofthe Triassic rocks of the Secondary Period, were evolved from purely astral progenitors contemporary with the SecondRace. They are thus post-Human, and, consequently, it is easy to account for the general resemblance between theirembryonic stages and those of Man, who necessarily embraces in himself and epitomizes in his development thefeatures of the group he originated. This explanation disposes of a portion of the Darwinist brief. \"But how to account forthe presence of the gill-clefts in the human foetus, which represent the stage through which the branchiae of the fish aredeveloped;* for the pulsating vessel corresponding to the heart of the lower fishes, which constitutes the foetal heart; forthe entire analogy presented by the segmentation of the human ovum, the formation of the blastoderm, and theappearance of the 'gastrula' stage, with corresponding stages in lower vertebrate life and even among the sponges; forthe various types of lower animal life which the form of the future child shadows forth in the cycle of its growth?\" \"Howcomes it to pass that stages in the life of fishes, whose ancestors swam\" -- aeons before the epoch of the First Root-Race,[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"At this period,\" writes Darwin, \"the arteries run in arch-like branches, as if to carry the blood to branchiae which are notpresent in the higher vertebrata, though the slits on the side of the neck still remain, marking their former (?) position.\"It is noteworthy that, though gill-clefts are absolutely useless to all but amphibia and fishes, etc., their appearance isregularly noted in the foetal development of vertebrates. Even children are occasionally born with an opening in the neckcorresponding to one of the clefts.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 685 REVERSION FROM THE WRONG END.-- \"in the seas of the Silurian period, as well as stages in that of the later amphibian, reptilian fauna, are mirrored in the'epitomized history' of human foetal development?\"This plausible objection is met by the reply that the Third Round terrestrial animal forms were just as much referable totypes thrown off by Third Round man, as that new importation into our planet's area -- the mammalian stock -- is to theFourth Round Humanity of the Second Root-race. The process of human foetal growth epitomizes not only the generalcharacteristics of the Fourth, but of the Third Round terrestrial life. The diapason of type is run through in brief. Occultistsare thus at no loss to \"account for\" the birth of children with an actual caudal appendage, or for the fact that the tail in thehuman foetus is, at one period, double the length of the nascent legs. The potentiality of every organ useful to animal lifeis locked up in Man -- the microcosm of the Macrocosm -- and abnormal conditions may not unfrequently result in thestrange phenomena which Darwinists regard as \"reversion to ancestral features.\"* Reversion, indeed, but scarcely in thesense contemplated by our present-day empiricists!-------CDARWINISM AND THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN: THE ANTHROPOIDS AND THEIR ANCESTRY.The public has been notified by more than one eminent modern geologist and man of science, that \"all estimate ofgeological duration is not merely impossible, but necessarily imperfect; for we are ignorant of the causes, though theymust have existed, which quickened or retarded the progress of the sedimentary deposits.\"** And now another man ofScience, as well known (Croll), calculating that the tertiary age began either 15 or 2 1/2 million of years ago -- the formerbeing a more correct calculation, according to Esoteric doctrine, than the latter there -- seems in this case, at least, novery great disagreement. Exact Science, refusing to see in man \"a special creation\" (to a certain degree the SecretSciences do the same), is at liberty to ignore the first three, or rather two-and-a-half Races -- the Spiritual, the semi-astral,and the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"* Those who with Haeckel regard the gill-clefts with their attendant phenomena as illustrative of an active function in ouramphibian and piscine ancestors (Vide his XII. and XIII. stages), ought to explain why the \"Vegetable with leaflets\"(Lefevre) represented in foetal growth, does not appear in his 22 stages through which the monera have passed in theirascent to Man.

But it can hardly do the same in the case of the Third at its closing period, the Fourth,and the Fifth Races, since it already divides mankind into Palaeolithic and Neolithic man.* The geologists of France placeman in the mid-miocene age (Gabriel de Mortillet), and some even in the Secondary period, as de Quatrefages suggests;while the English savants do not generally accept such antiquity for their species. But they may know better some day.For \"If we consider,\" says Sir Charles Lyell in \"Antiquity of Man,\" p. 246 --\"the absence or extreme scarcity of human bones and works of art in all strata, whether marine or fresh water, even inthose formed in the immediate proximity of land inhabited by millions of human beings, we shall be prepared for thegeneral dearth of human memorials in glacial formations, whether recent, Pleistocene, or of more ancient date. If therewere a few wanderers over lands covered with glaciers, or over seas infested with icebergs, and if a few of them left theirbones or weapons in moraines or in marine drifts, the chances, after the lapse of thousands of years, of a geologistmeeting with one of them must be infinitesimally small.\"The men of Science avoid pinning themselves down to any definite statement concerning the age of man, as indeed theyhardly could, and thus leave enormous latitude to bolder speculations. Nevertheless, while the majority of theAnthropologists carry back the existence of man only into the period of the post-glacial drift, or what is called theQuaternary period, those of them who, as Evolutionists, trace man to a common origin with that of the monkey, do notshow great consistency in their speculations. The Darwinian hypothesis demands, in reality, a far greater antiquity forman, than is even dimly suspected by superficial thinkers. This is proven by the greatest authorities on the question -- Mr.Huxley, for instance. Those, therefore, who accept the Darwinian evolution, ipso facto hold very tenaciously to anantiquity[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We confess to not being able to see any good reasons for Mr. E. Clodd's certain statement in Knowledge. Speaking ofthe men of Neolithic times, \"concerning whom Mr. Grant Allen has given . . . a vivid and accurate sketch,\" and who are\"the direct ancestors of peoples of whom remnants yet lurk in out-of-the-way corners of Europe, where they have beensqueezed or stranded,\" he adds to this: \"but the men of Palaeolithic times can be identified with no existing races; theywere savages of a more degraded type than any extant; tall, yet barely erect, with short legs and twisted knees, withprognathous, that is, projecting ape-like jaws, and small brains. Whence they come we cannot tell, and their 'graveknoweth no man to this day.' \"Besides the possibility that there may be men who know whence they came and how they perished -- it is not true to saythat the Palaeolithic men, or their fossils, are all found with \"small brains.\" The oldest skull of all those hitherto found, the\"Neanderthal skull,\" is of average capacity, and Mr. Huxley was compelled to confess that it was no real approximationwhatever to that of the \"missing link.\" There are aboriginal tribes in India whose brains are far smaller and nearer to thatof the ape than any hitherto found among the skulls of Palaeolithic man.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 687 GRANT ALLEN'S ILLUSIONS.of man so very great, indeed, that it falls not so far short of the Occultist's estimate.* The modest thousands of years ofthe Encyclopaedia Britannica and the 100,000 years, to which Anthropology in general limits the age of Humanity, seemquite microscopical when compared with the figures implied in Mr. Huxley's bold speculations. The former, indeed, makesof the original race of men ape-like cave-dwellers. The great English biologist, in his desire to prove man's pithecoidorigin, insists that the transformation of the primordial ape into a human being must have occurred millions of years back.For in criticising the excellent average cranial capacity of the Neanderthal skull, notwithstanding his assertion that it isoverlaid with \"pithecoid bony walls,\" coupled with Mr. Grant Allen's assurances that this skull \"possesses large bosses onthe forehead, strikingly (?) suggestive of those which give the gorilla its peculiarly fierce appearance,\"** (FortnightlyReview, 1882,) still Mr. Huxley is forced to admit that, in the said skull, his theory is once more defeated by the\"completely human proportions of the accompanying limb-bones, together with the fair development of the Engis skull.\" Inconsequence of all this we are notified that those skulls, \"clearly indicate that the first traces of the primordial stockwhence man has proceeded, need no longer be sought by those who entertain any form of the doctrine of progressivedevelopment in the newest Tertiaries; but that they may be looked for in an epoch more distant from the age of theELEPHAS PRIMIGENIUS than that is from us\"*** (Huxley).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The actual time required for such a theoretical transformation is necessarily enormous. \"If,\" says Professor Pfaff, \"in thehundreds of thousands of years which you (the Evolutionists) accept between the rise of palaeolithic man and our ownday, a greater distance of man from the brute is not demonstrable, (the most ancient man was just as far removed fromthe brute as the now living man), what reasonable ground can be advanced for believing that man has been developedfrom the brute, and has receded further from it by infinitely small gradations.\" . . . . \"The longer the interval of time placedbetween our times and the so-called palaeolithic men, the more ominous and destructive for the theory of the gradualdevelopment of man from the animal kingdom is the result stated.\" Huxley states (\"Man's Place in Nature,\" p. 159) thatthe most liberal estimates for the antiquity of Man must be still further extended."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"** The baselessness of this assertion, as well as that of many other exaggerations of the imaginative Mr. Grant Allen, wasably exposed by the eminent anatomist, Professor R.

It is only of late thatmodern Science began to widen with every year the abyss that now separates her from old Science, that of the Pliniesand Hippocrateses, none of whom would have derided the archaic teachings with respect to the evolution of the humanraces and animal species, as the present day Scientist -- geologist or anthropologist -- is sure to do.Holding, as we do, that the mammalian type was a post-human Fourth Round product, the following diagram -- as thewriter understands the teaching -- may make the process clear:--[[diagram]][[text on diagram:]]Primeval Astral ManSecond Astral RaceRace Third Semi AstralAstral Mammals Prototypes3rd Race ManSeparation into Sexes4th Race M, physical5th Race ManLower (physical) mammalsLower Apes.The unnatural union was invariably fertile, because the then mammalian types were not remote enough from their Root-type* -- Primeval Astral[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] ment to offer against the antiquity of man. But in this case modern Evolutiondemands far more than the fifteen million years of Croll for the Tertiary period, for two very simple but good reasons: (a)No anthropoid ape has been found before the Miocene period: (b) man's flint relics have been traced to the Pliocene andtheir presence suspected, if not accepted by all, in the Miocene strata. Again, where is the \"missing link\" in such case?And how could even a Palaeolithic Savage, a \"Man of Canstadt,\" evolve into thinking men from the brute Dryopithecus ofthe Miocene in so short a time. One sees now the reason why Darwin rejected the theory that only 60,000,000 years hadelapsed since the Cambrian period. \"He judges from the small amount of organic changes since the glacial epoch, andadds that the previous 140 million years can hardly be considered as sufficient for the development of the varied forms oflife which certainly existed toward the close of the Cambrian period.\" (Ch. Gould.)* Let us remember in this connection the esoteric teaching which tells us of Man having had in the Third Round aGIGANTIC APE-LIKE FORM on the astral plane. And similarly at the close of the Third Race in this Round. Thus itaccounts for the human features of the apes, especially of the later anthropoids -- apart from the fact that these latterpreserve by Heredity a resemblance to their Atlanto-Lemurian sires.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 689 THE INCUBUS OF ETHNOLOGY.Man -- to develop the necessary barrier. Medical science records such cases of monsters, bred from human and animalparents, even in our own day. The possibility is, therefore, only one of degree, not of fact. Thus it is that Occultism solvesone of the strangest problems presented to the consideration of the anthropologist.The pendulum of thought oscillates between extremes. Having now finally emancipated herself from the shackles oftheology, Science has embraced the opposite fallacy; and in the attempt to interpret Nature on purely materialistic lines,she has built up that most extravagant theory of the ages -- the derivation of man from a ferocious and brutal ape. Sorooted has this doctrine, in one form or another, now become, that the most Herculean efforts will be needed to bringabout its final rejection. The Darwinian anthropology is the incubus of the ethnologist, a sturdy child of modemMaterialism, which has grown up and acquired increasing vigour, as the ineptitude of the theological legend of Man's\"creation\" became more and more apparent. It has thriven on account of the strange delusion that -- as a scientist ofrepute puts it -- \"All hypotheses and theories with respect to the rise of man can be reduced to two (the Evolutionist andthe Biblical exoteric account) . . . There is no other hypothesis conceivable . . . \" !! The anthropology of the secretvolumes is, however, the best possible answer to such a worthless contention.The anatomical resemblance between Man and the higher Ape, so frequently cited by Darwinists as pointing to someformer ancestor common to both, presents an interesting problem, the proper solution of which is to be sought for in theesoteric explanation of the genesis of the pithecoid stocks. We have given it as far as was useful, by stating that the"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"bestiality of the primeval mindless races resulted in the production of huge man-like monsters -- the offspring of humanand animal parents. As time rolled on, and the still semi-astral forms consolidated into the physical, the descendants ofthese creatures were modified by external conditions, until the breed, dwindling in size, culminated in the lower apes ofthe Miocene period. With these the later Atlanteans renewed the sin of the \"Mindless\" -- this time with full responsibility.The resultants of their crime were the species of apes now known as Anthropoid.It may be useful to compare this very simple theory -- and we are willing to offer it even as a hypothesis to the unbelievers-- with the Darwinian scheme, so full of insurmountable obstacles, that no sooner is one of these overcome by a more orless ingenious hypothesis, than ten worse difficulties are forthwith discovered behind the one disposed of.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 690 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.§ IV.DURATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL PERIODS, RACE CYCLES, AND THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN.MILLIONS of years have dropped into Lethe, leaving no more recollection in the memory of the profane than the fewmillenniums of the orthodox Western chronology as to the origin of Man and the history of the primeval races.All depends on the proofs found for the antiquity of the Human Race. If the still-debated man of the Pliocene or even theMiocene period was the Homo primigenius, then science may be right (argumenti causa) in basing its presentanthropology -- as to the date and mode of origin of \"Homo sapiens\" -- on the Darwinian theory.* But if the skeletons ofman should, at any time, be discovered in the Eocene strata, but no fossil ape, thereby proving the existence of man priorto the anthropoid -- then Darwinians will have to exercise their ingenuity in another direction. And it is said in well-informed quarters that the XXth century will be yet in its earliest teens, when such undeniable proof of Man's priority willbe forthcoming.Even now evidence is brought forward that the dates for the foundations of cities, civilizations and various other historicalevents have been absurdly curtailed. This was done as a peace-offering to Biblical chronology. \"No date,\" writes the well-known Palaeontologist, Ed. Lartet, \"is to be found in Genesis, which assigns a time for the birth of primitive humanity\"; butchronologists have for fifteen centuries endeavoured to force the Bible facts into agreement with their systems. Thus, noless than one hundred and forty different opinions have been formed about the single date of \"Creation\"; \"and betweenthe extreme variations there is a discrepancy of 3,194 years, in the reckoning of the period between the beginning of theworld and the birth of Christ.** Within the last few years, archaeologists have had to throw back by nearly 3,000 yearsalso the beginnings of Babylonian civilization.

We had characterised the late George Smith's chronology ofthe Chaldeans and Assyrians, made by him to fit in with that of Moses, as quite fantastic. And now, in this respect atleast, later Assyriologists have corroborated our denial. For, whereas G. Smith makes Sargon I. (the prototype of Mosesin his legend) reign in the city of Akkad about 1600 B.C. -- probably out of a latent respect for Moses, whom the Biblemakes to flourish 1571 B.C. -- we now learn from the first of the six Hibbert lectures delivered by Professor A. H. Sayce,of Oxford, in 1887, that: \"Old views of the early annals of Babylonia and its religions have been much modified by recentdiscovery. The first Semitic Empire, it is now agreed, was that of Sargon of Accad, who established a great library,patronized literature, and extended his conquests across the sea into Cyprus. It is now known that he reigned as early asB.C. 3750.\" \"The Accadian monuments found by the French at Tel-loh must be even older, reaching back to about B.C.4,000,\" in other words, to the fourth year of the World's creation agreeably with Bible chronology, and when Adam was inhis swaddling clothes. Perchance, in a few years more, the 4,000 years may be further extended. The well-known Oxfordlecturer remarked during his disquisitions upon \"The origin and Growth of Religion as illustrated by the BabylonianReligion\" that: \"The difficulties of systematically tracing the origin and history of the Babylonian Religion wereconsiderable. The sources of our knowledge of the subject were almost wholly monumental, very little help beingobtainable from classical or Oriental writers. Indeed, it was an undeniable fact that the Babylonian priesthood intentionallyswaddled up the study of the religious texts in coils of almost insuperable difficulty.\" That they have confused the dates,and especially the order of events \"intentionally,\" is undeniable, and for a very good reason: their writings and recordswere all esoteric. The Babylonian priests did no more than the Priests of other ancient nations. Their records were meantonly for the Initiates and their disciples, and it is only the latter who were furnished with the keys to the true meaning. ButProfessor"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 692 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Sayce's remarks are promising. For he explains the difficulty by saying that as -- \"the Nineveh library contained mostlycopies of older Babylonian texts, and the copyists pitched upon such tablets only as were of special interest to theAssyrian conquerors, belonging to a comparatively late epoch, this added much to the greatest of all our difficulties --namely, our being so often left in the dark as to the age of our documentary evidence, and the precise worth of ourmaterials for history.\" Thus one has a right to infer that some still fresher discovery may lead to a new necessity forpushing the Babylonian dates so far beyond the year 4,000 B.C., as to make them pre-Kosmic in the judgment of everyBible worshipper.How much more would paleontology have learned had not millions of works been destroyed! We talk of the Alexandrianliterary lore, which has been thrice destroyed, namely, by Julius Caesar B.C. 48, in A.D. 390, and lastly in the year 640,A.D., by the general of Kaliph Omar. What is this in comparison with the works and records destroyed in the primitiveAtlantean Libraries, wherein records are said to have been traced on the tanned skins of gigantic antediluvian monsters?Or again the destruction of the countless Chinese books by command of the founder of the Imperial Tsin dynasty, TsinShi Hwang-ti, in 213 B.C.? Surely the brick-clay tablets of the Imperial Babylonian Library, and the priceless treasures ofthe Chinese collections could have never contained such information as one of the aforesaid \"Atlantean\" skins wouldhave furnished to the ignorant world.But even with the extremely meagre data at hand, Science has been able to see the necessity of throwing back nearlyevery Babylonian date, and has done so quite generously. We learn from Professor Sayce that even the archaic statuesat Tel-loh, in Lower Babylonia, have suddenly been assigned a date contemporary with the fourth dynasty in Egypt.Unfortunately, dynasties and Pyramids have the fate of geological periods; their dates are arbitrary, and depend on therespective whims of the men of science. Archaeologists know now, it is said, that the afore-mentioned statues arefashioned out of green diorite, that can only be got in the Peninsula of Sinai; and \"they accord in the style of art, and inthe standard of measurement employed, with the similar diorite statues of the pyramid builders of the third and fourthEgyptian dynasties. . . . . Moreover, the only possible period for a Babylonian occupation of the Sinaitic quarries must beplaced shortly after the close of the epoch at which the pyramids were built; and thus only can we understand how thename of Sinai could have been derived from that of Sin, the primitive Babylonian moon-god.\" This is very logical, but whatis the date fixed for these \"dynasties\"? Sanchoniathon's and Manetho's Synchronistic tables and their figures have beenrejected, or whatever------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 693 NO AGREEMENT BETWEEN SCIENTISTS.remained of these after holy Eusebius' handling of them; and still we have to remain satisfied with the four or fivethousand years B.C. so liberally allotted to Egypt. At all events one point is gained. There is, at last, a city on the face ofthe earth which is allowed, at least, 6,000 years, and it is Eridu. Geology has found it out. According to Professor Sayceagain, --\"They are now also able to obtain time for the silting up of the head of the Persian Gulf, which demands a lapse ofbetween 5,000 and 6,000 years since the period when Eridu, now twenty-five miles inland, was the seaport at the mouthof the Euphrates, and the seat of Babylonian commerce with Southern Arabia and India. More than all, the newchronology gives time for the long series of eclipses recorded in the great astronomical work called 'The Observations ofBel'; and we are also enabled to understand the otherwise perplexing change in the position of the vernal equinox, whichhas occurred since our present zodiacal signs were named by the Earliest Babylonian astronomers. When the Accadiancalendar was arranged and the Accadian months were named, the sun at the vernal equinox was not, as now, in Pisces,or even in Aries, but in Taurus. The rate of the precession of the equinoxes being known, we learn that at the vernalequinox the sun was in Taurus from about 4,700 years B.C., and we thus obtain astronomical limits of date which cannotbe impugned.\"*It may make our position plainer if we state at once that we use Sir C. Lyell's nomenclature for the ages and periods, andthat when we talk of the Secondary and Tertiary age, of the Eocene, Miocene and Pliocene periods -- this is simply tomake our facts more comprehensible. Since these ages and periods have not yet been allowed fixed and determineddurations, 2 1/2 and 15 million years being assigned at different times to one and the same age (the Tertiary) -- and sinceno two geologists and naturalists seem to agree on this point -- Esoteric teachings may remain quite indifferent to whetherman is shown to appear in the Secondary or the Tertiary age. If the latter age may be allowed even so much as 15 millionyears' duration -- well and good; for the Occult doctrine, jealously guarding its real and correct figures as far as concernsthe First, Second, and two-thirds of the Third Root-Race -- gives clear information upon one point only -- the age of\"Vaivasvata Manu's humanity.\" (Vide Part I., Vol. II., \"Chronology of the Brahmins.\")Another definite statement is this: It is during the so-called Eocene period that the continent to which the Fourth Racebelonged, and on which it lived and perished, showed the first symptoms of sinking. And it was in the Miocene age, that itwas finally destroyed -- save the little island mentioned by Plato. It is these points that have to be checked by thescientific data.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* From a Report of the \"Hibbert Lectures, 1887.

The work on \"Comparative Geology: the World-Life,\" by Prof. A. Winchell, furnishes us with curious data. Here we find an opponent of the Nebular theory, a reverendgentleman, smiting with all the force of the hammer of his odium theologicum on the rather contradictory hypothesis of thegreat stars of Science, in the matter of sidereal and cosmical phenomena based on their respective relations to terrestrialdurations. The \"too imaginative physicists and naturalists\" do not fare very easily under this shower of their ownspeculative figures when placed side by side, and cut rather a sorry figure. Thus he shows:--\"Sir William Thomson, on the basis of the observed principles of cooling, concludes that no more than ten million years(elsewhere he makes it 100,000,000) can have elapsed since the temperature of the Earth was sufficiently reduced tosustain vegetable life.* Helmholz calculates that twenty million years would suffice for the original nebula to condense tothe present dimensions of the sun. Prof. S. Newcomb requires only ten millions to attain a temperature of 212 [[degrees]]Fahr.** Croll estimates seventy million years for the diffusion of the heat, etc.*** Bischof calculates that 350 million yearswould be required for the earth to cool from a temperature of 2,000 [[degrees]] to 200 [[degrees]] Centigrade. Read,basing his estimate on observed rates of denudation, demands 500 million years since sedimentation began inEurope.**** Lyell ventured a rough guess of 240 million years; Darwin thought 300 million years demanded by the organictransformations which his theory contemplates, and Huxley is disposed to demand a 1,000 millions\" (!!).To this Prof. Winchell observes that \"some biologists . . . . seem to close their eyes tight and leap at one bound into theabyss of millions of years, of which they have no more adequate estimate than of infinity.\"***** Then he proceeds to givewhat he takes to be more correct geological figures: a few will suffice.According to Sir W. Thomson \"the whole incrusted age of the world is 80,000,000 years\"; and agreeably with Prof.Houghton's calculations of a minimum limit for the time since the elevation of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Nat.

These figures are found too small by the author,who forthwith extends them to 37,000,000 years.Again, according to Croll,** 2,500,000 years \"represents the time since the beginning of the Tertiary age\" in one work;and according to another modification of his view, 15,000,000 only have elapsed since the beginning of the Eoceneperiod;*** which, being the first of the three Tertiary periods, leaves the student suspended between 2 1/2 and 15millions. But if one has to hold to the former moderate figures, then the whole incrusted age of the world would be131,600,000 years.****As the last glacial period extended from 240,000 to 80,000 years ago (Prof. Croll's view), therefore, man must haveappeared on earth from 100 to 120,000 years ago. But, as says Prof. Winchell, with reference to the antiquity of theMediterranean race, \"it is generally believed to have made its appearance during the later decline of the continentalglaciers.\" Yet, he adds, this \"does not concern, however, the antiquity of the Black and Brown races, since there arenumerous evidences of their existence in more southern regions, in times remotely pre-glacial\" (p. 379).As a specimen of geological certainty and agreement, these figures also may be added. Three authorities -- Messrs. T.Belt, F.G.S.; J. Croll, F.R.S.; and Robert Hunt, F.R.S., -- in estimating the time that has elapsed since the Glacial epoch,give absolutely different figures, namely:--Mr. Belt ... 20,000 years.Mr. J.

A wise word of advice fromthe Occultists to the gentlemen geologists: they ought to imitate the cautious example of Masons. As chronology, theysay, cannot measure the era of the creation, therefore, their \"Ancient and Primitive Rite\" uses 000,000,000 as the nearestapproach to reality.The same uncertainty, contradictions and disagreement reign on all other subjects.The scientific authorities on the Descent of Man are again, for all practical purposes, a delusion and a snare. There aremany anti-Darwinists in the British Association, and \"Natural Selection\" begins to lose ground. Though at one time thesaviour, which seemed to rescue the learned theorists from a final intellectual collapse into the abyss of fruitlesshypothesis, it begins to be distrusted. Even Mr. Huxley is showing signs of truancy to \"Selection,\" and thinks \"naturalselection not the sole factor\":--\"We greatly suspect that she (Nature) does make considerable jumps in the way of variation now and then, and thatthese saltations give rise to some of the gaps which appear to exist in the series of known forms\" (Review of Kolliker'sCriticisms).Again, in \"Fallacies of Darwinism,\" (p. 160), C. R. Bree, M.D., argues in this wise in considering the fatal gaps in Mr.Darwin's theory:--\"It must be again called to mind that the intermediate forms must have been vast in numbers. . . . . Mr. St. George Mivartbelieves that change in evolution may occur more quickly than is generally believed; but Mr. Darwin sticks manfully to hisbelief, and again tells us 'natura non facit saltum' \" -- wherein the Occultists are at one with Mr. Darwin.Esoteric teaching fully corroborates the idea of nature's slowness and dignified progression. \"Planetary impulses\" are allperiodical. Yet this Darwinian theory, correct as it is in minor particulars, agrees no more with Occultism than with Mr.Wallace, who, in his \"Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,\" shows pretty conclusively that something morethan \"natural selection\" was requisite to produce physical man.Let us, meanwhile, examine the scientific objections to this scientific theory, and see what they are.Mr. St. George Mivart is found arguing that --. . . . \". . . . it will be a moderate computation to allow 25,000,000 for the deposition of the strata down to and including theUpper Silurian. If,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 697 MIVART'S BILLIONS OF YEARS.then, the evolutionary work done during this deposition only represents a hundredth part of the sum total, we shall require2,500,000,000 years for the complete development of the whole animal Kingdom to its present state. Even one quarter ofthis, however, would far exceed the time which physics and astronomy seem able to allow for the completion of thisprocess. Finally, a difficulty exists as to the reason of the absence of rich fossiliferous deposits in the oldest strata -- if lifewas then as abundant and varied, as on the Darwinian theory it must have been. Mr. Darwin himself admits 'the case atpresent must remain inexplicable'; and this may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views entertained in hisown work. . . . .\"Thus, then, we find a wonderful (and on Darwinian principles all but inexplicable) absence of minutely transitional forms.All the most marked groups . . . . . appear at once upon the scene. Even the horse, the animal whose pedigree has beenprobably best preserved, affords no conclusive evidence of specific origin by infinitesimal fortuitous variations; while someforms, as the labyrinthodonts and trilobites, which seemed to exhibit gradual change, are shown by further investigationto do nothing of the sort. . . . All these difficulties are avoided if we admit that new forms of animal life of all degrees ofcomplexity appear from time to time with comparative suddenness, being evolved according to laws in part depending onsurrounding conditions, in part internal -- similar to the way in which crystals (and perhaps from recent researches thelowest forms of life) build themselves up according to the internal laws of their component substance and in harmony andcorrespondence with all environing influences and conditions.\" (\"Genesis of Species,\" p. 142.)\"The internal laws of their component substance.\" These are wise words, and the admission of the possibility, a prudentone. But how can these internal laws be ever recognized, if Occult teaching is discarded? As a friend writes, whiledrawing our attention to the above speculations: \"In other words, the doctrine of Planetary Life-Impulses must beadmitted. Otherwise, why are species now stereotyped, and why do even domesticated breeds of pigeons and manyanimals relapse into their ancestral types when left to themselves?\" But the teaching about planetary life-impulses has tobe clearly defined and as clearly understood if present confusion would not be made still more perplexing. All thesedifficulties would vanish as the shadows of night disappear before the light of the rising Sun, if the following esotericaxioms were admitted: (a) the enormous antiquity (and the existence) of our planetary chain; (b) the actuality of theSeven Rounds; (c) the separation of human races (outside the purely anthropological division) into Seven distinct Root-Races, of which our present European Humanity is the fifth; (d) the antiquity of Man in this (Fourth) Round; and finally (e)that as these Races evolve from ethereality to materiality, and from the latter back again into relative physical tenuity of"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"texture, so every living (so-called) organic species of animals with vegetation included, changes with every new Root-Race.

Surely, Science ought to try and be morelogical than it now is, as it can hardly maintain the theory of man's descent from an anthropoidal ancestor, and deny in thesame breath any reasonable antiquity to that man! Once Mr. Huxley talks of \"the vast intellectual chasm between the manand ape,\" and \"the present enormous gulf between the two,\"* and if he admits the necessity of extending Scientificallowances for the age of man on earth for such slow and progressive development, then all those men of Science, whoare of his way of thinking, at any rate, ought to come to some approximate figures, at least, and agree upon the probableduration of those Pliocene, Miocene, and Eocene periods of which so much is said, and about which nothing definite isknown -- if they dare not venture beyond. But no two scientists seem to agree. Every period seems to be a mystery in itsduration, and a thorn in the side of the geologists; and, as just shown, they are unable to harmonize their conclusionseven with regard to the comparatively recent geological formations. Thus, no reliance can be placed on their figures whenthey do give any, for with them it is all either millions or simply thousands of years!That which is said may be strengthened by the confessions made by themselves and the synopsis of it, found in that\"Circle of Sciences,\" the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which shows the mean accepted in the geological and anthropologicalriddles. In that work the cream of the most authoritative opinions is skimmed off; nevertheless, we find in it the refusal toassign any definite chronological date, even to such, comparatively speaking, late epochs as the Neolithic era, though, fora wonder, an age is established for the beginnings of certain geological periods; at any rate of some few, the duration ofwhich could hardly be shortened any more, without an immediate conflict with facts.Thus, it is surmised in the great Encyclopaedia (Vol. X., art. \"Geology,\" p. 227), that \"100 million years have passed . . . . .since the solidification of our Earth, when the earliest form of life appeared upon it.**\"But it seems quite as hopeless to try to convert the modern Geologists and Ethnologists as it is to make DarwinianNaturalists perceive their mistakes.

In France, somesavants do not find it nearly \"sufficient.\" Le Couturier claims for the same 350 million years; Buffon was satisfied with 34millions -- but there are those in the more modern schools who will not be content under 500 million years.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 699 THE ADEPT-ASTRONOMER.Science knows as little as of the men from other planets. With the exception of Flammarion and a few mystics amongastronomers, even the habitableness of other planets is mostly denied. Yet such great adept astronomers were theScientists of the earliest races of the Aryan stock, that they seem to have known far more about the races of Mars andVenus than the modern Anthropologist knows of those of the early stages of the Earth.Let us leave modern Science aside for a moment and turn to ancient knowledge. As we are assured by Archaic Scientiststhat all such geological cataclysms -- from the upheaval of oceans, deluges, and shifting of continents, down to thepresent year's cyclones, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, and even the extraordinary weatherand seeming shifting of seasons which perplexes all European and American meteorologists -- are due to, and dependon the moon and planets; aye, that even modest and neglected constellations have the greatest influence on themeteorological and cosmical changes, over, and within our earth, let us give one moment's attention to our siderealdespots and rulers of our globe and men. Modern Science denies any such influence; archaic Science affirms it. We maysee what both say with regard to this question.-------B. ON CHAINS OF PLANETS AND THEIR PLURALITY.Did the Ancients know of worlds besides their own? What are the data of the Occultists in affirming that every globe is aseptenary chain of worlds -- of which only one member is visible -- and that these are, were, or will be, \"man-bearing,\" justas every visible star or planet is? What do they mean by \"a moral and physical influence\" of the sidereal worlds on ourglobes?Such are the questions often put to us, and they have to be considered from every aspect. To the first of the two queriesthe answer is:-- We believe it because the first law in nature is uniformity in diversity, and the second -- analogy. \"Asabove, so below.\" That time is gone by for ever, when, although our pious ancestors believed that our earth was in thecentre of the universe, the church and her arrogant servants could insist that we should regard as a blasphemy thesupposition that any other planet could be inhabited. Adam and Eve, the Serpent, and the Original Sin followed byatonement through blood, have been too long in the way, and thus was universal truth sacrificed to the insane conceit ofus little men.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 700 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Now what are the proofs thereof? Except inferential evidence and logical reasoning, there are none for the profane. Tothe Occultists, who believe in the knowledge acquired by countless generations of Seers and Initiates, the data offered inthe Secret Books are all-sufficient. The general public needs other proofs, however. There are some Kabalists and evensome Eastern Occultists, who, failing to find uniform evidence upon this point in all the mystic works of the nations,hesitate to accept the teaching. Even such \"uniform evidence\" will be forthcoming presently. Meanwhile, we mayapproach the subject from its general aspect, and see whether belief in it is so very absurd, as some scientists along withother Nicodemuses would have it. Unconsciously, perhaps, in thinking of a plurality of inhabited \"Worlds,\" we imaginethem to be like the globe we inhabit and peopled by beings more or less resembling ourselves. And in so doing we areonly following a natural instinct. Indeed, so long as the enquiry is confined to the life-history of this globe we canspeculate on this question with some profit, and ask ourselves what were the \"Worlds\" spoken of in all the ancientscriptures of Humanity, with some hope of at least asking an intelligible question. But how do we know (a) what kind ofBeings inhabit the globes in general; and (b) whether those who rule planets superior to our own, do not exercise thesame influence on our earth consciously, that we may exercise unconsciously -- say on the small planets (planetoids orasteroids) in the long run, by our cutting the Earth to pieces, opening canals, and thereby entirely changing our climates.Of course, like Caesar's wife, the planetoids cannot be affected by our suspicion. They are too far, etc., etc. Believing inesoteric astronomy, however, we are not so sure of that.But when, extending our speculations beyond our planetary chain, we try to cross the limits of the solar system, thenindeed we act as do presumptuous fools. For -- while accepting the old Hermetic axiom: \"As above, so below\" -- we maywell believe that as Nature on Earth displays the most careful economy, utilizing every vile and waste thing in hermarvellous transformations, and withal never repeating herself -- we may justly conclude that there is no other globe in allher infinite systems so closely resembling this earth that the ordinary powers should be able to imagine and reproduce itssemblance and containment.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We are taught that the highest Dhyan Chohans, or Planetary Spirits (beyond the cognizance of the law of analogy), arein ignorance of what lies beyond the visible planetary systems, since their essence cannot assimilate itself to that ofworlds beyond our solar system. When they reach a higher stage of evolution these other universes will be open to them;meanwhile they have complete knowledge of all the worlds within and beneath the limits of our solar system.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 701 STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.And indeed we find in the romances as in all the so-called scientific fictions and spiritistic revelations from moon, stars,and planets, merely fresh combinations or modifications of the men and things, the passions and forms of life with whichwe are familiar, when even on the other planets of our own system nature and life are entirely different from ours.Swedenborg was pre-eminent in inculcating such an erroneous belief.But even more. The ordinary man has no experience of any state of consciousness other than that to which the physicalsenses link him. Men dream; they sleep the profound sleep which is too deep for dreams to impress the physical brain;and in these states there must still be consciousness. How, then, while these mysteries remain unexplored, can we hopeto speculate with profit on the nature of globes which, in the economy of nature, must needs belong to states ofconsciousness other and quite different from any which man experiences here?And this is true to the letter. For even great adepts (those initiated of course), trained seers though they are, can claimthorough acquaintance with the nature and appearance of planets and their inhabitants belonging to our solar systemonly. They know that almost all the planetary worlds are inhabited, but can have access to -- even in spirit -- only those ofour system; and they are also aware how difficult it is, even for them, to put themselves into full rapport even with theplanes of consciousness within our system, but differing from the states of consciousness possible on this globe; i.e., onthe three planes of the chain of spheres beyond our earth. Such knowledge and intercourse are possible to thembecause they have learned how to penetrate to planes of consciousness which are closed to the perceptions of ordinarymen; but were they to communicate their knowledge, the world would be no wiser, because it lacks that experience ofother forms of perception which alone could enable them to grasp what was told them.Still the fact remains that most of the planets, as the stars beyond our system, are inhabited, a fact which has beenadmitted by the men of science themselves. Laplace and Herschell believed it, though they wisely abstained fromimprudent speculation; and the same conclusion has been worked out and supported with an array of scientificconsiderations by C. Flammarion, the well-known French Astronomer. The arguments he brings forward are strictlyscientific, and such as to appeal even to a materialistic mind, which would remain unmoved by such thoughts as those ofSir David Brewster, the famous physicist, who writes:--\"Those 'barren spirits' or 'base souls,' as the poet calls them, who might be led to believe that the Earth is the onlyinhabited body in the universe, would have no difficulty in conceiving the earth also to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 702 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.have been destitute of inhabitants. What is more, if such minds were acquainted with the deductions of geology, theywould admit that it was uninhabited for myriads of years; and here we come to the impossible conclusion that duringthese myriads of years there was not a single intelligent creature in the vast domains of the Universal King, and thatbefore the protozoic formations there existed neither plant nor animal in all the infinity of space\"!*Flammarion shows, in addition, that all the conditions of life -- even as we know it -- are present on some at least of theplanets, and points to the fact that these conditions must be much more favourable on them than they are on our Earth.Thus scientific reasoning, as well as observed facts, concur with the statements of the seer and the innate voice in man'sown heart in declaring that life -- intelligent, conscious life -- must exist on other worlds than ours."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"But this is the limit beyond which the ordinary faculties of man cannot carry him. Many are the romances and tales, somepurely fanciful, others bristling with scientific knowledge, which have attempted to imagine and describe life on otherglobes. But one and all, they give but some distorted copy of the drama of life around us. It is either, with Voltaire, themen of our own race under a microscope, or, with de Bergerac, a graceful play of fancy and satire; but we always findthat at bottom the new world is but the one we ourselves live in. So strong is this tendency that even great natural, thoughnon-initiated seers, when untrained, fall a victim to it; witness Swedenborg, who goes so far as to dress the inhabitants ofMercury, whom he meets with in the spirit-world, in clothes such as are worn in Europe.Commenting on this tendency, Flammarion in his work \"Sur la Pluralite des Mondes habites,\" says:-- \"It seems as if in theeyes of those authors who have written on this subject, the Earth were the type of the Universe, and the Man of Earth, thetype of the inhabitants of the heavens. It is, on the contrary, much more probable, that, since the nature of other planets isessentially varied, and the surroundings and conditions of existence essentially different, while the forces which presideover the creation of beings and the substances which enter into their mutual constitution are essentially distinct, it wouldfollow that our mode of existence cannot be regarded as in any way applicable to other globes.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Since no single atom in the entire Kosmos is without life and consciousness, how much more then its mighty globes? --though they remain sealed books to us men who can hardly enter even into the consciousness of the forms of life nearestus?We do not know ourselves, then how can we, if we have never been trained to it and initiated, fancy that we canpenetrate the consciousness of the smallest of the animals around us?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 703 WORLDS MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE.Those who have written on this subject have allowed themselves to be dominated by terrestrial ideas, and fell thereforeinto error.\" (\"Pluralite des Mondes,\" p. 439.)But Flammarion himself falls into the very error which he here condemns, for he tacitly takes the conditions of life on earthas the standard by which to determine the degree to which other planets are adapted for habitation by \"other Humanities.\"Let us, however, leave these profitless and empty speculations, which, though they seem to fill our hearts with a glow ofenthusiasm and to enlarge our mental and spiritual grasp, do but in reality cause a factitious stimulation, and blind usmore and more to our ignorance not only of the world we inhabit, but even of the infinitude contained within ourselves.When, therefore, we find in the Bibles of Humanity \"other worlds\" spoken of, we may safely conclude that they not onlyrefer to other states of our planetary chain and Earth, but also to other inhabited globes -- stars and planets; withal, thatthe latter were never speculated upon. The whole of antiquity believed in the Universality of life. But no really initiatedseer of any civilized nation has ever taught that life on other stars could be judged by the standard of terrestrial life. Thatwhich is generally meant by \"earths\" and worlds, relates (a) to the \"rebirths\" of our globe after each manvantara and along period of \"obscuration\"; and (b) to the periodical and entire changes of the Earth's surface, when Continentsdisappear, to make room for Oceans, and Oceans and Seas are violently displaced and sent rolling to the poles, to cedetheir emplacements to new Continents.We may begin with the Bible -- the youngest of the World-Scriptures. In Ecclesiastes, chap. i., we read these words of theKing-Initiate:-- \"One generation passeth away and another generation cometh, but the earth abideth for ever,\" and again,\"The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done, is that which shall be done, and there is nonew thing under the sun.\" Under these words it is not easy to see the reference to the successive cataclysms by whichthe Races of mankind are swept away, or, going further back, to the various transitions of the globe during the process ofits formation. But if we are told that this refers only to our world as we now see it, -- then we shall refer the reader to theNew Testament, where St. Paul speaks (in Hebrews i.) of the Son (the manifested Power) whom (God) hath appointedheir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds (plural.)*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This relates to the Logos of every Cosmogony. The unknown Light -- with which he is said to be co-eternal and coeval --is reflected in the \"First-Born,\" the Protogonos; [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 704 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.This \"Power\" is Hokhmah or (Chochmah) the Wisdom and the Word. We shall probably be told that by this term \"worlds,\"the stars, heavenly bodies, etc., were meant. But apart from the fact that \"stars\" were not known as \"worlds\" to theignorant editors of the Epistles, if even they must have been known to Paul, who was an Initiate (\"a Master-Builder\"), wecan quote on this point an eminent theologian, Cardinal Wiseman. In Vol. I, p. 309, of his work treating of the indefiniteperiod of the six days -- or shall we say \"too definite\" -- period of the six days of creation and the 6,000 years, heconfesses that we are in total darkness upon the meaning of that statement of St. Paul, unless we are permitted tosuppose that allusion is made in it, i.e., the period which elapsed between the first and second verses of chapter i. ofGenesis -- to those primitive revolutions, i.e., the destructions and the re-productions (of the world) indicated in chapter i.of Ecclesiastes; or, to accept, with so many others, and in its literal sense, the passage (Hebrews i. 1,) that speaks of thecreation of worlds -- in plural. . . . . It is very singular, he adds, that all the cosmogonies should agree to suggest the sameidea, and preserve the tradition of a first series of revolutions, owing to which the world was destroyed and againrenewed."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Had the Cardinal studied the Zohar his doubts would have changed to certitude. Thus saith Idra Suta (in the \"Zohar,\" iii.,292, c.): \"There were old worlds which perished as soon as they came into existence; worlds with and without form calledScintillas -- for they were like the sparks under the Smith's hammer, flying in all directions. Some were the primordialworlds which could not continue long, because the 'aged' -- his name be sanctified -- had not as yet assumed his form,*the workman was not yet the 'Heavenly man.' \"** Again in the Midrash, written long before the Kabala of Simeon BenIochai, Rabbi Abahu explains:-- \"The Holy One, blessed be his name, has successively formed and destroyed sundryworlds before this one*** . . .

As said elsewhere, it means not only the destruction of manyworlds which have ended their life-career, but also that of the several continents which have disappeared, as also theirdecline and geographical change of place.The mysterious \"Kings of Edom\" are sometimes referred to as the \"Worlds\" that had been destroyed; but it is a \"cloak.\"The Kings who reigned in Edom before there reigned a King in Israel, or the \"Edomite Kings,\" could never symbolize the\"prior worlds,\" but only the \"attempts at men\" on this globe: the \"pre-Adamite races,\" of which the Zohar speaks, andwhich we explain as the First Root-Race. For, as, speaking of the six Earths (the six \"limbs\" of Microprosopus) it is saidthat the Seventh (our Earth) came not into the computation when the Six were created (the six spheres above our globein the terrestrial chain), so the first seven Kings of Edom are left out of calculation in Genesis. By the law of analogy andpermutation, in the \"Chaldean Book of Numbers,\" as also in the \"Books of Knowledge\" and of \"Wisdom,\" the \"sevenprimordial worlds\" mean also the \"seven primordial\" races (sub-races of the First Root-Race of the Shadows); and, again,the Kings of Edom are the sons of \"Esau the father of the Edomites\" (Gen. xxxvi. 43); i.e., Esau represents in the Biblethe race which stands between the Fourth and the Fifth, the Atlantean and the Aryan. \"Two nations are in thy womb,\"saith the Lord to Rebekah; and Esau was red and hairy. From verse 24 to 34, ch. xxv. of Genesis contains the allegoricalhistory of the birth of the Fifth Race.\"And the Kings of ancient days died and their chiefs (crowns) were found no more,\" says Siphrah Dzenioutha (3). . . .\"The Head of a nation that has not been formed at the beginning in the likeness of the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This sentence contains a dual sense and a profound mystery in the occult sciences the secret of which if, and when,known -- confers tremendous powers on the Adept to change his visible form.** Idra Suta, Zohar, iii. 136, c. \"A sinking down from their status\" -- is plain; from active worlds they have fallen into atemporary obscuration -- they rest, and hence are entirely changed.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 706 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.White Head: its people is not from this Form,\" states the Zohar (iii.). . . . \"Before it (the White Head, the Fifth Race orAncient of the Ancients) arranged itself in its (own, or present) Form . . . all worlds have been destroyed; therefore it iswritten: And Bela, the Son of Beor, reigned in Edom\" (Gen. xxxvi.). Here the \"worlds\" stand for races. \"And he (such oranother King of Edom) died, and another reigned in his stead\" (ibid 31 et seq.).No Kabalist who has hitherto treated of the symbolism and allegory hidden under these \"Kings of Edom\" seems to haveperceived more than one aspect of it. They are neither the \"worlds that were destroyed,\" nor the \"Kings that died\" --alone; but both, and much more, to treat of which there is no space at present. Therefore, leaving the mystic parables ofthe Zohar, we will return to the hard facts of materialistic science; first, however, citing a few from the long list of greatthinkers who have believed in the plurality of inhabited worlds in general, and in worlds that preceded our own. These are,the great mathematicians Leibnitz and Bernouilli, Isaac Newton himself, as can be read in his \"Optics\"; Buffon, thenaturalist; Condillac, the sceptic; Bailly, Lavater, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and, as a contrast to the two last named --suspected at least of mysticism -- Diderot and most of the writers of the Encyclopaedia. Following these come Kant, the"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"founder of modern philosophy; the poet philosophers, Goethe, Krause, Schelling; and many astronomers, from Bode,Fergusson and Herschell to Lalande and Laplace, with their many disciples in more recent years.A brilliant list of honoured names indeed; but the facts of physical astronomy speak even more strongly in favour of thepresence of life, even organised life, on other planets. Thus in four meteorites which fell respectively at Alais in France,the Cape of Good Hope, in Hungary, and again in France, there was found, on analysis, graphite, a form of carbon knownto be invariably associated with organic life on this earth of ours. And that the presence of this carbon is not due to anyaction occurring within our atmosphere is shown by the fact that carbon has been found in the very centre of a meteorite;while in one which fell at Argueil, in the south of France, in 1857, there was found water and turf, the latter being alwaysformed by the decomposition of vegetable substances.And further, examining the astronomical conditions of the other planets, it is easy to show that several are far betteradapted for the development of life and intelligence -- even under the conditions with which men are acquainted -- than isour earth. For instance, on the planet Jupiter the seasons, instead of varying between wide limits as do ours, change byalmost imperceptible degrees, and last twelve times------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 707 WHAT FLAMMARION TELLS US.as long as ours. Owing to the inclination of its axis the seasons on Jupiter are due almost entirely to the eccentricity of itsorbit, and hence change slowly and regularly. We shall be told, that no life is possible on Jupiter, as it is in anincandescent state. But not all astronomers agree with this. For instance what we say, is said by M. Flammarion: and heought to know.On the other hand Venus would be less adapted for human life such as exists on earth, since its seasons are moreextreme and its changes of temperature more sudden; though it is curious that the duration of the day is nearly the sameon the four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Mars.On Mercury, the Sun's heat and light are seven times what they are on the Earth, and astronomy teaches that it isenveloped in a very dense atmosphere. And as we see that life appears more active on earth in proportion to the lightand heat of the sun, it would seem more than probable that its intensity is far, far greater on Mercury than here.Venus, like Mercury, has a very dense atmosphere, as also has Mars and the snows which cover their poles, the cloudswhich hide their surface, the geographical configuration of their seas and continents, the variations of seasons andclimates, are all closely analogous -- at least to the eye of the physical astronomer. But such facts and the considerationsto which they give rise, have reference only to the possibility of the existence on these planets of human life as known onearth. That some forms of life such as we know are possible on these planets, has been long since abundantlydemonstrated, and it seems perfectly useless to go into detailed questions of the physiology, etc., etc., of thesehypothetical inhabitants, since after all the reader can arrive only at an imaginary extension of his familiar surroundings. Itis better to rest content with the three conclusions which M. C. Flammarion, whom we have so largely quoted, formulatesas rigorous and exact deductions from the known facts and laws of science.I. The various forces which were active in the beginning of evolution gave birth to a great variety of beings on the severalworlds; both in the organic and inorganic kingdoms.II. The animated beings were constituted from the first according to forms and organisms in correlation with thephysiological state of each inhabited globe.III. The humanities of other worlds differ from us, as much in their inner organization as in their external physical type.Finally the reader who may be disposed to question the validity of these conclusions as being opposed to the Bible, maybe referred to an Appendix in M. Flammarion's work dealing in detail with this question; since in a work like the present itseems unnecessary to point out the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 708 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.logical absurdity of those churchmen, who deny the plurality of worlds on such grounds.In this connection we may well recall those days when the burning zeal of the Primitive Church opposed the doctrine ofthe earth's rotundity, on the ground that the nations at the Antipodes would be outside the pale of salvation; and againhow long it took for a nascent science to break down the idea of a solid firmament, in whose grooves the stars moved forthe special edification of terrestrial humanity.The theory of the earth's rotation was met by a like opposition -- even to the martyrdom of its discoverers -- because,besides depriving our orb of its dignified central position in space, this theory produced an appalling confusion of ideas asto the Ascension -- the terms \"up\" and \"down\" being proved to be merely relative, thus complicating not a little thequestion of the precise locality of heaven.*According to the best modern calculations, there are no less than 500,000,000 of stars of various magnitudes, within therange of the best telescopes. As to the distances between them, they are incalculable. Is, then, our microscopical Earth --a \"grain of sand on an infinite sea-shore\" -- the only centre of intelligent life? Our own Sun, itself 1,300 times larger thanour planet, sinks into insignificance beside that giant Sun -- Sirius, -- and the latter in its turn is dwarfed by otherluminaries in infinite Space. The self-centred conception of Jehovah as the special guardian of a small and obscure semi-nomadic tribe, is tolerable beside that which confines sentient existence to our microscopical globe. The primary reasonswere without doubt: (1) Astronomical ignorance on the part of the early Christians, coupled with an exaggeratedappreciation of man's own importance -- a crude form of selfishness; and (2) the dread that, if the hypothesis of millions ofother inhabited globes was accepted, the crushing rejoinder would ensue -- \"Was there then a Revelation to each world?\""},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"involving the idea of the Son of God eternally \"going the rounds\" as it were. Happily it is now unnecessary to waste timeand energy in proving the possibility of the existence of such worlds. All intelligent persons admit it.

It raises, perhaps, a not ill-founded suspicion that even our age of scientific enlightenmentmay be as grossly absurd in its materialistic negations, as the men of the middle ages were absurd and materialistic intheir religious affirmations.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 709 SCIENCE AND OCCULTISM MAY YET AGREE.Sciences -- then the evolution of the preceding races is half proved. For where is that physicist or geologist who isprepared to maintain that the Earth has not changed scores of times, in the millions of years which have elapsed in thecourse of its existence; and changing its \"skin,\" as it is called in Occultism, that the Earth has not had each time herspecial humanities adapted to such atmospheric and climatic conditions as were entailed. And if so, why should not ourpreceding four and entirely different mankinds have existed and thrived before our Adamic (Fifth Root) Race?Before closing our debates, however, we have to examine the so-called organic evolution more closely. Let us searchwell and see whether it is quite impossible to make our Occult data and chronology agree up to a certain point with thoseof Science.-------C.SUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS ON ESOTERIC GEOLOGICAL CHRONOLOGY.It seems, however, possible to calculate the approximate duration of the geological periods from the combined data ofScience and Occultism now before us. Geology is, of course, able to determine almost with certainty one thing -- thethickness of the several deposits. Now, it also stands to reason that the time required for the deposition of any stratum ona sea-bottom must bear a strict proportion to the thickness of the mass thus formed. Doubtless the rate of erosion of landand the sorting out of matter on to ocean beds has varied from age to age, and cataclysmic changes of various kindsbreak the \"uniformity\" of ordinary geological processes. Provided, however, we have some definite numerical basis onwhich to work, our task is rendered less difficult than it might at first sight appear to be. Making due allowance forvariations in the rate of deposit, Professor Lefevre gives us the relative figures which sum up geological time. He does notattempt to calculate the lapse of years since the first bed of the Laurentian rocks was deposited, but postulating that timeas = X, he presents us with the relative proportions in which the various periods stand to it. Let us premise our estimateby stating that, roughly speaking, the Primordial rocks are 70,000 ft., the Primary 42,000 ft., the Secondary 15,000 ft., theTertiary 5,000 ft., and the Quaternary some 500 ft. in thickness:--\"Dividing into an hundred parts the time, whatever its actual length, that has passed since the dawn of life on this earth(lower Laurentian strata), we shall be led to attribute to the primordial age more than half of the whole duration, say 53.5;to the Primary 32.2; to the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 710 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Secondary 11.5; to the Tertiary 2.3; to the Quaternary 0.5 or one-half per cent.\" (\"Philosophy,\" p. 481.)Now, as it is certain, on occult data, that the time which has elapsed since the first sedimentary deposits = 320,000,000years, we are able to infer that the:--ROUGH APPROXIMATIONS.Primordial lasted 171,200,000 years.LaurentianCambrianSilurianPrimary lasted 103,040,000 yearsDevonianCoalPermianSecondary lasted 36,800,000 yearsTriassicJurassicCretaceousTertiary lasted 7,360,000 years (probably in excess)EoceneMiocenePliocene"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Quaternary lasted 1,600,000 years (probably in excess).Such estimates harmonise with the statements of Esoteric Ethnology in almost every particular. The Tertiary Atlanteanpart-cycle, from the \"apex of glory\" of that Race in the early Eocene to the great mid-Miocene cataclysm, would appear tohave lasted some 3 1/2 to four million years. If the duration of the Quaternary is not rather (as seems likely)overestimated, the sinking of Ruta and Daitya would be post-Tertiary. It is probable that the results here given allowsomewhat too long a period to both the Tertiary and Quaternary, as the Third Race goes very far back into the SecondaryAge. Nevertheless, the figures are most suggestive.But the argument from geological evidence being only in favour of 100,000,000 years, let us compare our claims andteachings with those of exact science.Mr. Edward Clodd,* in reviewing M. de Mortillet's work \"Materiaux pour l'Histoire de Homme,\" which places man in themid-Miocene period,** remarks that \"it would be in defiance of all that the doctrine of evolu-[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Knowledge, March 31, 1882.** And who yet, in another work, \"La Prehistorique Antiquite de l'Homme,\" some twenty years ago, generously allowedonly 230,000 years to our mankind.

For wereit to win support from believers in special creation, it would never gain the favour of the evolutionists, and vice versa.Truth must rest upon its own firm foundations of facts, and take its chances for recognition, when every prejudice in theway is disposed of. Though the question has been already fully considered in its main aspects, it is, nevertheless,advisable to combat every so-called \"scientific\" objection as we go along, when making what are regarded as hereticaland \"anti-scientific\" statements.Let us briefly glance at the divergences between orthodox and esoteric science, on the question of the age of the globeand of man. With the two respective synchronistic tables before him, the reader will be enabled to see at a glance theimportance of these divergences; and to perceive, at the same time, that it is not impossible -- nay, it is most likely -- thatfurther discoveries in geology and the finding of fossil remains of man will force science to confess that it is esotericphilosophy which is right after all, or, at any rate, nearer to the truth.-------PARALLELISM OF LIFE.[[First Column]]SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES.Science divides the period of the globe's history, since the beginning of life on earth (or the Azoic age), into five maindivisions or periods, according to Haeckel.**[[First Column continued on next page]][[Second Column]]ESOTERIC THEORY.Leaving the classification of the geological periods to Western Science, esoteric philosophy divides only the life-periodson the globe.

As the \"Historical\" Period has begun, with the IndianAryans, with their Vedas, for their multitudes,****** and far earlier in the Esoteric Records, it is useless to establish hereany parallels.[[Second Column continued on next page]][[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Those who feel inclined to sneer at that doctrine of Esoteric Ethnology, which pre-supposes the existence of Man in theSecondary Age, will do well to note the fact that one of the most distinguished anthropologists of the day, M. deQuatrefages, seriously argues in that direction. He writes: \"There is nothing impossible in the supposition that he (Man)may have appeared on the globe with the first representatives of the type to which he belongs in virtue of his organism.\"This statement approximates most closely to our fundamental assertion that man preceded the other mammalia.Professor Lefevre admits that the \"labours of Boucher de Perthes, Lartet, Christy, Bourgeois, Desnoyers, Broca, deMortillet, Hamy, Gaudry, Capellini, and a hundred others, have overcome all doubts and clearly established theprogressive development of the human organism and industries from the Miocene epoch of the Tertiary age.\"(\"Philosophy,\" p. 499, chapter on Organic Evolution.)

Surely not.** This inclusion of the First Race in the Secondary is necessarily only a provisional working-hypothesis -- the actualchronology of the First, Second, and Early Third Races being closely veiled by the Initiates. For all that can be said on thesubject, the First Root-Race may have been Pre-Secondary, as is, indeed, taught. (Vide supra.)*** The above parallels stand good only if Professor Croll's earlier calculations are adopted, namely, of 15,000,000 yearssince the beginning of the Eocene period (see Charles Gould's \"Mythical Monsters,\" p. 84), not those in his \"Climate andTime,\" which allow only 2 1/2 million years', or at the utmost three million years' duration to the Tertiary age. This,however, would make the whole duration of the incrusted age of the world only 131,600,000 years according to ProfessorWinchell, whereas in the Esoteric doctrine, sedimentation began in this Round approximately over 320 million years ago.Yet his calculations do not clash much with ours with regard to the epochs of glacial periods in the Tertiary age, which iscalled in our Esoteric books the age of the \"Pigmies.\" With regard to the 320 millions of years assigned to sedimentation,it must be noted that even a greater time elapsed during the preparation of this globe for the Fourth Round previous tostratification.**** Though we apply the term \"truly human,\" only to the Fourth Atlantean Root-Race, yet the Third Race is almost humanin its latest portion, since it is during its fifth sub-race that mankind separated sexually, and that the first man was bornaccording to the now normal process. This \"first man\" answers in the Bible (Genesis) to Enos or Henoch, son of Seth (ch.iv.).***** Geology records the former existence of a universal ocean, sheets of marine sediments uniformly presenteverywhere testifying to it; but, it is not even the epoch referred to in the allegory of Vaivasvata Manu. The latter is aDeva-Man (or Manu) saving in an ark (the female principle) the germs of humanity, and also the seven Rishis -- whostand here as the symbols for the seven human principles -- of which allegory we have spoken elsewhere. The \"UniversalDeluge\" is the watery abyss of the Primordial Principle of Berosus. (See Stanzas from 2 to 8 in Part I.). How, if Crollallowed fifteen million years to have elapsed since the Eocene period (which we state on the authority of a Geologist, Mr.Ch. Gould) only 60 millions are assigned by him \"since the beginning of the Cambrian period, in the Primordial Age\" --passes comprehension. The Secondary strata are twice the thickness of the Tertiary, and Geology thus shows theSecondary age alone to be of twice the length of the Tertiary. Shall we then accept only 15 million years for both thePrimary and the Primordial? No wonder Darwin rejected the calculation.****** We hope that we have furnished all the Scientific data for it elsewhere.******* It is conceded by Geology to be \"beyond doubt that a considerable period must have supervened after thedeparture of Palaeolithic man and before the arrival of his Neolithic successor.\" (See James Geikie's \"PrehistoricEurope,\" and Ch. Gould's \"Mythical Monsters,\" p. 98).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 716 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.man is made out almost an abject savage, his lake dwellings notwithstanding.* For see what a learned geologist, Mr.Charles Gould, tells the reader in his \"Mythical Monsters\":--\"Palaeolithic men were unacquainted with pottery and the art of weaving, and apparently had no domesticated animals orsystem of cultivation; but the Neolithic lake-dwellers of Switzerland had looms, pottery, cereals, sheep, horses,\" etc., etc.Yet, though \"Implements of horn, bone, and wood were in common use among both races . . . those of the older arefrequently distinguished by their being sculptured with great ability, or ornamented with life-like engravings of the variousanimals living at the period; whereas there appears to have been a marked absence of any similar artistic ability** on thepart of Neolithic man.\" Let us give the reasons for it.(1) The oldest fossil man, the primitive cave-men of the old Palaeolithic period, and of the Pre-glacial period (of whateverlength, and however far back), is always the same genus man, and there are no fossil remains proving for him \"what theHipparion and Anchitherium have proved for the genus horse -- that is, gradual progressive specialization from a simpleancestral type to more complex existing forms\" (\"Modern Science,\" p. 181).(2) As to the so-called Palaeolithic hatchet . . . \"when placed side by side with the rudest forms of stone hatchets actuallyused by the Australian and other savages, it is difficult to detect any difference\" (Ibid, p. 112). This goes to prove thatthere have been savages at all times; and the inference would be that there might have been civilized people in thosedays as well, cultured nations contemporary with those rude savages. We see such a thing in Egypt 7,000 years ago."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Resembling in a manner the pile-villages of Northern Borneo.** \"The most clever sculptor of modern times would probably not succeed very much better, if his graver were a splinter offlint and stone and bone were the materials to be engraved\"!! (Prof. Boyd Dawkins' \"Cave-Hunting,\" p. 344.) It is needlessafter such a concession to further insist on Huxley's, Schmidt's, Laing's, and others' statements to the effect thatPalaeolithic man cannot be considered to lead us back in any way to a pithecoid human race; thus demolishing thefantasies of many superficial evolutionists. The relic of artistic merit here re-appearing in the Chipped-Stone-Age men, istraceable to their Atlantean ancestry. Neolithic man was a fore-runner of the great Aryan invasion, and immigrated fromquite another quarter -- Asia, and in a measure Northern Africa. (The tribes peopling the latter towards the North-West,were certainly of an Atlantean origin -- dating back hundreds of thousands of years before the Neolithic Period in Europe,-- but they had so diverged from the parent type as to present no longer any marked characteristic peculiar to it.) As to thecontrast between Neolithic and Palaeolithic Man, it is a remarkable fact that, as Carl Vogt remarks, the former was acannibal, the much earlier man of the Mammoth era not. Human manners and customs do not seem to improve with time,then? Not in this instance at any rate.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 717 ONE SALVATION FOR SCIENCE.(3) An obstacle which is the direct consequence of the two preceding: Man, if no older than the Palaeolithic period, couldnot possibly have had the actual time to get transformed from the \"missing link\" into what he is known to have been evenduring that remote geological time, i.e., even a finer specimen than many of the now existing races.The above lends itself naturally to the following syllogism: (1) The primitive man (known to Science) was, in somerespects, even a finer man of his genus than he is now. (2) The earliest monkey known, the lemur, was less anthropoidthan the modern pithecoid species. (3) Conclusion: even though a missing link were found, the balance of evidencewould remain more in favour of the ape being a degenerated man made dumb by some fortuitous circumstances,* thantending to show that man descends from a pithecoid ancestor. The theory cuts both ways.On the other hand, if the existence of Atlantis is accepted, and the statement is believed that in the Eocene Age \"even inits very first part, the great cycle of the fourth race men, the Atlanteans had already reached its highest point . . . .\"(Esoteric Buddhism, p. 64) then some of the present difficulties of science might be easily made to disappear. The rudeworkmanship of the Palaeolithic tools proves nothing against the idea that, side by side with their makers, there livednations highly civilized. We are told that \"only a very small portion of the earth's surface has been explored, and of this avery small portion consists of ancient land surfaces or fresh water formations, where alone we can expect to meet withtraces of the higher forms of animal life,\" . . . and that \"even these have been so imperfectly explored, that where we nowmeet with thousands and tens of thousands of undoubted human remains lying almost under our feet, it is only within thelast thirty years that their existence has even been suspected\" (p. 98). It is very suggestive also that along with the rudehaches of the lowest savage, explorers meet with specimens of workmanship of such artistic merit as could hardly befound, or expected, in a modern peasant belonging to any European country -- unless in exceptional cases. The \"portrait\"of the \"Reindeer feeding,\" from the Thayngin grotto in Switzerland, and those of the man running, with two horse's headssketched close to him -- a work of the Reindeer period, i.e., at least 50,000 years ago -- are pronounced by Mr. Laing notonly exceedingly well done, but, especially the reindeer feeding, as one that \"would do credit to any modern animalpainter\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* On the data furnished by modern science, physiology, and natural selection, and without resorting to any miraculouscreation, two negro human specimens of the lowest intelligence -- say idiots born dumb -- might by breeding produce adumb Pastrana species, which would start a new modified race, and thus produce in the course of geological time theregular anthropoid ape.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 718 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.-- by no means exaggerated praise, as anyone may see (Vide infra). Now, since side by side with the modern Esquimaux,who also have a tendency, like their Palaeolithic ancestors of the Reindeer period, the rude and savage human species,to be constantly drawing with the point of their knives sketches of animals, scenes of the chase, etc., we have ourgreatest painters of Europe, why could not the same have happened in those days? Compared with the specimens ofEgyptian drawing and sketching -- \"7,000 years ago\" -- the \"earliest portraits\" of men, horses' heads, and reindeer, made50,000 years ago, are certainly superior. Nevertheless, the Egyptians of those periods are known to have been a highlycivilized nation, whereas the Palaeolithic men are called savages of the lower type. This is a small matter seemingly, yetextremely suggestive as showing that every new geological discovery is made to fit in with current theories, instead of thereverse. Yes; Mr. Huxley is right in saying, \"Time will show.\" It will, and must vindicate Occultism.Meanwhile, the most uncompromising materialists are driven by necessity into the most occult-like admissions. Strange tosay, it is the most materialistic -- those of the German school -- who, with regard to physical development, come thenearest to the teachings of the Occultists. Thus, Professor Baumgartner, who believes that \"the germs for the higheranimals could only be the eggs of the lower animals\"; who thinks that \"besides the advance of the vegetable and animalworld in development, there occurred in that period the formation of new original germs,\" which formed the basis of newmetamorphoses, etc. -- thinks also that \"the first men who proceeded from the germs of animals beneath them, lived firstin a larva state.\"Just so, in a larva state, we say, too; only from no \"animal\" germ, and that \"larva\" was the soulless astral form of the pre-physical Races. And we believe, as the German professor does, with several other men of Science in Europe now, thatthe human races \"have not descended from one pair, but appeared immediately in numerous races\"; (Anfange zu einerPhysiologischen Schopfungs-geschichte der Pflanzen und Thierwelt, 1885). Therefore, when we read \"Force and Matter,\""},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"and find that Emperor of Materialists, Buchner, repeating after Manu and Hermes, that \"the plant passes imperceptiblyinto the animal, and the animal into man\" (p. 85), we need only add \"and man into a spirit,\" to complete the Kabalisticaxiom. The more so, since on page 82 of the same work we read the following admission: . . . \"Produced in the way ofspontaneous generation . . . it is by the aid of intense natural forces and endless periods of time (that) there hasprogressively arisen that rich and infinitely modified organic world by which we are at present surrounded.\" . . . And (page84) \"Spontaneous generation played, no doubt,------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 719 BETWEEN TWO VOIDS.a more important part in the primeval epoch than at present; nor can it be denied that in this way beings of a higherorganization were produced than now,\"* for this is the claim of Occultism.The whole difference lies in this: Modern Science places her materialistic theory of primordial germs on earth, and the lastgerm of life on this globe, of man, and everything else, between two voids. Whence the first germ, if both spontaneousgeneration and the interference of external forces, are absolutely rejected now? Germs of organic life, we are told, by SirW. Thomson, came to our earth in some meteor? This helps in no way and only shifts the difficulty from this earth to thesupposed meteor.These are our agreements and disagreements with Science. About the endless periods we are, of course, at one evenwith materialistic speculation; for we believe in Evolution, though on different lines. Professor Huxley very wisely says: \"Ifany form of progressive development is correct, we must extend by long epochs the most liberal estimate that has yetbeen made of the antiquity of man.\" But when we are told that this man is a product of the natural forces inherent inmatter, force, according to modern views, being but a quality of matter, a \"mode of motion,\" etc.; and when we find Sir W.Thomson repeating in 1885 what was asserted by Buchner and his school thirty years ago, we fear all our reverence forreal Science is vanishing into thin air! One can hardly help thinking that materialism is, in certain cases, a disease. Forwhen men of Science, in the face of the magnetic phenomena and the attraction of iron particles through insulatingsubstances, like glass, maintain that the said attraction is due to \"molecular motion,\" or to the \"rotation of the molecules ofthe magnet,\" then, whether the teaching comes from a \"credulous\" Theosophist innocent of any notion of physics, or froman eminent man of Science, it is equally ridiculous. The individual who asserts such a theory in the teeth of fact, is onlyone more proof that \"When people have not a niche in their minds in which to shoot facts, so much the worse for thefacts.\"As present the dispute between the spontaneous generationists and their opponents is at rest, having ended in theprovisional victory of the latter. But even they are forced to admit, as Buchner did, and Messrs. Tyndall and Huxley still do-- that spontaneous generation must have occurred once, under \"special thermal conditions.\" Virchow refuses even toargue the question; it must have taken place sometime in the history of our planet: and there's an end of it. This seems tolook more natural than Sir W. Thomson's hypothesis just quoted, that the germs of organic life fell on our earth in somemeteor; or that other[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Force and Matter,\" by Dr. Louis Buchner, translated and edited by J.

But this does not help Science tosolve the still greater problem -- the origin and the descent of Man, for here is a still worse plaint and lamentation.\"While we can trace the skeletons of Eocene mammals through several directions of specialization in succeeding Tertiarytimes, man presents the phenomenon of an unspecialized skeleton which cannot fairly be connected with any of theselines.\" (\"Origin of the World,\" p. 39, by Sir W. Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S.)The secret could be soon told, not only from the esoteric but even from the standpoint of every religion the world over,without mentioning the Occultists. The \"specialized skeleton\" is sought for in the wrong place, where it can never befound. It is expected to be discovered in the physical remains of man, in some pithecoid \"missing link,\" with a skull largerthan that of the ape's, and with a cranial capacity smaller than in man, instead of looking for that specialization in thesuper-physical essence of his inner astral constitution, which can hardly be excavated from any geological strata! Such atenacious, hopeful clinging to a self-degrading theory is the most wonderful feature of the day.[[diagram]]REINDEER ENGRAVED ON ANTLER BY PALAEOLITHIC MAN.

Here wehave the true artistic raccourci, and correct lights and shadows without any plane model before the artist, who copieddirect from nature, thus exhibiting a knowledge of anatomy and proportion. The artist who engraved this reindeerbelonged, we are asked to believe, to the primitive \"semi-animal\" savages (contemporaneous with the mammoth and the"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"woolly rhinoceros), whom some over-zealous Evolutionists once sought to picture to us as distinct approximations to thetype of their hypothetical \"pithecoid man\"!This engraved antler proves as eloquently as any fact can that the evolution of the races has ever proceeded in a seriesof rises and falls, that man, perhaps, is as old as incrustated Earth, and -- if we can call his Divine ancestor \"Man\" -- farolder still.Even de Mortillet himself seems to experience a vague distrust of the conclusions of modern archaeologists, when hewrites:-- \"The prehistoric is a new science, far, very far, from having said its last word.\" (\"Prehist. Antiq. of Man,\" 1883.)According to Lyell, one of the highest authorities on the subject, and the \"Father\" of Geology:-- \"The expectation ofalways meeting with a lower type of human skull, the older the formation in which it occurs, is based on the theory ofprogressive development, and it may prove to be sound; nevertheless we must remember that as yet we have no distinctgeological evidence that the appearance of what are called the inferior races of mankind has always preceded inchronological order that of the higher races.\" (\"Antiq. of Man,\" p. 25.) Nor has such evidence been found to this day.Science is thus offering for sale the skin of a bear, which has hitherto never been seen by mortal eye!This concession of Lyell's reads most suggestively with the subjoined utterance of Professor Max Muller, whose attack onthe Darwinian Anthropology from the standpoint of LANGUAGE has, by the way, never been satisfactorily answered:--\"What do we know of savage tribes beyond the last chapter of their history?\" (Cf. this with the esoteric view of theAustralians, Bushmen, as well as of Palaeolithic European man, the Atlantean offshoots retaining a relic of a lost culture,which throve when the parent Root-Race was in its prime.) \"Do we ever get an insight into their antecedents. . . . Howhave they come to be what they are? . . . . Their language proves, indeed, that these so-called heathens, with theircomplicated systems of mythology, their artificial customs, their unintelligible whims and savageries, are not the creaturesof to-day or yesterday. Unless we admit a special creation for these savages, they must be as old as the Hindus, theGreeks and Romans (far older). . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 722 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.They may have passed through ever so many vicissitudes, and what we consider as primitive, may be, for all we know, aRELAPSE INTO SAVAGERY or a corruption of something that was more rational and intelligible in former stages.\"(\"India,\" 1883, F. Max Muller.)\"The primeval savage is a familiar term in modern literature,\" remarks Professor Rawlinson, \"but there is no evidence thatthe primeval savage ever existed. Rather all the evidence looks the other way.\" (\"Antiq. of Man Historically Considered.\")In his \"Origin of Nations,\" pp. 10-11, he rightly adds: \"The mythical traditions of almost all nations place at the beginningof human history a time of happiness and perfection, a 'golden age' which has no features of savagery or barbarism, butmany of civilization and refinement.\" How is the modern evolutionist to meet this consensus of evidence?We repeat the question asked in \"Isis Unveiled\": \"Does the finding of the remains in the cave of Devon prove that therewere no contemporary races then who were highly civilized? When the present population of the earth have disappeared,and some archaeologist belonging to the 'coming race' of the distant future shall excavate the domestic implements ofone of our Indian or Andaman Island tribes, will he be justified in concluding that mankind in the nineteenth century was'just emerging from the Stone Age'?\"Another strange inconsistency in scientific knowledge is that Neolithic man is shown as being far more of a primitivesavage than the Palaeolithic one. Either Lubbock's \"Pre-historic Man,\" or Evans' \"Ancient Stone Implements\" must be atfault, or -- both. For this is what we learn from these works and others:--(1) As we pass from Neolithic to Palaeolithic Man, the stone implements become, from gracefully shaped and polishedinstruments, rude lumbering makeshifts. Pottery, etc., disappear as we descend the scale. And yet the latter couldengrave such a reindeer!(2) Palaeolithic Man lived in caves which he shared with hyaenas and lions also,* whereas Neolithic man dwelt in lake-villages and buildings.Every one who has followed even superficially the geological discoveries of our day, knows that a gradual improvement inworkmanship is found, from the clumsy chipping and rude chopping of the early Palaeolithic haches, to the relativelygraceful stone celts of that part of the Neolithic period immediately preceding the use of metals. But this is in Europe, afew portions only of which were barely rising from the waters in the days[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* In such a case Palaeolithic man must have been endowed in his day with thrice Herculean force and magicinvulnerability, or else the lion was as weak as a lamb at that period, for both to share the same dwelling. We may as wellbe asked to believe next that it is that lion or hyaena which has engraved the deer on the antler, as be told that this bit ofworkmanship was done by a savage of such a kind.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 723 ENTRAPPED BY THE REINDEER.of the highest Atlantean civilizations. There were rude savages and highly civilized people then, as there are now. If50,000 years hence, pigmy Bushmen are exhumed from some African cavern together with far earlier pigmy elephants,such as were found in the cave deposits of Malta by Milne Edwards, will that be a reason to maintain that in our age allmen and all elephants were pigmies? Or if the weapons of the Veddhas of Ceylon are found, will our descendants bejustified in setting us all down as Palaeolithic savages? All the articles which geologists now excavate in Europe cancertainly never date earlier than from the close of the Eocene age, since the lands of Europe were not even above water"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"before that period. Nor can what we have said be in the least invalidated by theorists telling us that these quaint sketchesof animals and men by Palaeolithic man, were executed only toward the close of the Reindeer period -- for thisexplanation would be a very lame one indeed, in view of the geologists' ignorance of even the approximate duration ofperiods.The Esoteric Doctrine teaches distinctly the dogma of the risings and falls of civilization; and now we learn that: \"It is aremarkable fact that cannibalism seems to have become more frequent as man advanced in civilization, and that while itstraces are frequent in Neolithic times they . . . . altogether disappear in the age of the mammoth and the reindeer.\" (\"Mod.Science and Mod. Thought,\" p. 164.)Another evidence of the cyclic law and the truth of our teachings. Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worshipdied out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (Chinamen, African negroes, &c.)gradually brought the worship back. The Vedas countenance no idols; all the modern Hindu writings do.\"In the early Egyptian tombs, and in the remains of the pre-historic cities excavated by Dr. Schliemann, images of owl andox-headed goddesses, and other symbolical figures, or idols, are found in abundance. But when we ascend into Neolithictimes, such idols are no longer found . . . . the only ones which may be said with some certainty to have been idols areone or two discovered by M. de Braye in some artificial caves of the Neolithic period . . . which appear to be intended forfemale figures of life size\" . . . . (p. 199 Ibid.)And these may have been simply statues. Anyhow, all this is one among the many proofs of the cyclic rise and fall ofcivilization and religion. The fact that no traces of human relics or skeletons are so far found beyond post-tertiary or\"Quaternary\" times -- though Abbe Bourgeois' flints may serve as a warning* -- seems to point to the truth of anotheresoteric statement,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* More than twenty specimens of fossil monkeys have been found in one locality alone, in Miocene strata (Pikermi, nearAthens).

The vales have grown into mountains and themountains have crumbled to the bottom of the seas.\" . . . Fourth Race mankind, thinned after the last cataclysm by two-thirds of its population, instead of settling on the new continents and islands that reappeared while their predecessorsformed the floors of new Oceans -- deserted that which is now Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for the summits ofgigantic mountains, the seas that surrounded some of the latter having since \"retreated\" and made room for the tablelands of Central Asia.The most interesting example of this progressive march is perhaps afforded by the celebrated Kent's Cavern at Torquay.In that strange recess, excavated by water out of the Devonian limestone, we find a most curious record preserved for usin the geological memoirs of the earth. Under the blocks of limestone, which heaped the floor of the cavern, werediscovered, embedded in a deposit of black earth, many implements of the Neolithic period of fairly excellentworkmanship, with a few fragments of pottery -- possibly traceable to the era of the Roman colonization. There is no traceof Palaeolithic man here. No flints or traces of the extinct animals of the Quaternary period. When, however, we penetratestill deeper through the dense layer of stalagmite beneath the mould into the red earth, which, of course, itself onceformed the pavement of the retreat, things assume a very different aspect. Not one implement fit to bear comparison withthe finely-chipped weapons found in the overlying stratum is to be seen; only a host of the rude and lumbering littlehatchets (with which the monstrous giants of the animal world were subdued and killed by little man, we have to think?)and scrapers of the Palaeolithic age, mixed up confusedly with the bones of species now either extinct or emigrated,driven away by change of climate. It is the artificer of these ugly little hatchets, you see, who sculptured the reindeer overthe brook, on the antler as shown above. In all cases we meet with the same evidence that, from historic to Neolithic andfrom Neolithic to Palaeolithic man, things slope downwards on an inclined plane from the rudiments of civilization to themost abject barbarism -- in Europe again. We are made also to face the \"mammoth age\" -- the extreme or earliestdivision of the Palaeolithic age -- in which the great rudeness of implements reaches its maximum, and the brutal (?)appearance of contemporary skulls, such as the Neanderthal, point to a very low type of Humanity. But they maysometimes point also to something besides; to a race of men quite distinct from our (Fifth Race) Humanity.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------[[Footnote continued from previous page]] too short for him to have been transformed -- stretch it as you may.

Broca, Virey, and a number of theFrench anthropologists have recognised that the lower race of man, comprising the Australian, Tasmanian, and Negrorace, excluding the Kaffirs and the Northern Africans, should be placed apart. The fact that in this species, or rather sub-species, the third lower molars are usually larger than the second, and the squamosal and frontal bones are generallyunited by suture, places the Homo Afer on the level of being as good a distinct species as many of the kinds of finches. Ishall abstain on the present occasion from mentioning the facts of hybridity, whereon the late Professor Broca has soexhaustively commented. The history, in the past ages of the world, of this race is peculiar. It has never originated asystem of architecture or a religion of its own\" (Dr. C. Carter Blake). It is peculiar, indeed, as we have shown in the caseof the Tasmanians. However it may be, fossil man in Europe can neither prove nor disprove the antiquity of man on thisEarth nor the age of his earliest civilizations."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"It is time the Occultists should disregard any attempts to laugh at them, scorning the heavy guns of the satire of the menof science as much as the pop-guns of the profane, since it is impossible, so far, to obtain either proof or disproof, whiletheir theories can stand the test better than the hypotheses of the Scientists at any rate. As to the proof for the antiquitywhich they claim for man, they have, moreover, Darwin himself and Lyell. The latter confesses that they (the naturalists)\"have already obtained evidence of the existence of man at so remote a period that there has been time for manyconspicuous mammalia, once his contemporaries, to die out, and this even before the era of the earliest historicalrecords.\"* This is a statement made by one of England's great authorities upon the question. The two sentences thatfollow are as suggestive, and may well be remembered by the students of Occultism, for with all others he says: \"In spiteof the long lapse of prehistoric ages during which he (Man) must have flourished on Earth, there is no proof of anyperceptible change in his bodily structure. If, therefore, he ever diverged from some unreasoning brute ancestor, we mustsuppose him to have existed at a far more distant epoch, possibly on some continents or islands now submergedbeneath the Ocean.\"Thus lost continents are officially suspected. That worlds (also Races) are periodically destroyed by fire (volcanoes andearthquakes) and water, in turn, and renewed, is a doctrine as old as man. Manu, Hermes, the Chaldees, all antiquitybelieved in this. Twice already[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Antiquity of Man,\" p. 530.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 726 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.has the face of the globe been changed by fire, and twice by water, since man appeared on it. As land needs rest andrenovation, new forces, and a change for its soil, so does water. Thence arises a periodical redistribution of land andwater, change of climates, etc., all brought on by geological revolution, and ending in a final change in the axis.Astronomers may pooh-pooh the idea of a periodical change in the behaviour of the globe's axis, and smile at theconversation given in the Book of Enoch between Noah and his \"grandfather\" Enoch; the allegory is, nevertheless, ageological and an astronomical fact: there is a secular change in the inclination of the earth's axis, and its appointed timeis recorded in one of the great Secret Cycles. As in many other questions, Science is gradually moving toward our way ofthinking. Dr. Henry Woodward, F.R.S., F.G.S., writes in the Popular Science Review (New Series in Vol. I. p. 115), Art.:\"Evidences of the Age of Ice.\" . . . . \"If it be necessary to call in extramundane causes to explain the great increase of iceat this glacial period, I would prefer the theory propounded by Dr. Robert Hooke in 1688; since, by Sir Richard Phillipsand others; and lastly by Mr. Thomas Belt, C.E., F.G.S.; namely, a slight increase in the present obliquity of the ecliptic, aproposal in perfect accord with other known astronomical facts, and the introduction of which is essential to our cosmicalcondition as a unit in the great solar system.\"The following, quoted from a Lecture by W. Pengelly, F.R.S., F.G.S., delivered in March, 1885, on \"The extinct Lake ofBovey Tracey\" shows the hesitation, in the face of every evidence in favour of Atlantis, to accept the fact. It is a quotationin the body of the Lecture:--\"Evergreen Figs, Laurels, Palms, and Ferns having gigantic rhizomes have their existing congeners in a sub-tropicalclimate, such, it cannot be doubted, as prevailed in Devonshire in Miocene times, and are thus calculated to suggestcaution when the present climate of any district is regarded as normal.\"When, moreover, Miocene plants are found in Disco Island, on the west coast of Greenland, lying between 69[[degrees]]20' and 70[[degrees]] 30' N. lat.; when we learn that among them were two species found also at Bovey (Sequoiacouttsiae, Quercus Lyelli); when, to quote Professor Heer, we find that \"the 'splendid evergreen' (Magnolia Inglefieldi)'ripened its fruits so far north as on the parallel of 70 [[degrees]] ' \" (Phil. Trans. clix., 457, 1869); when also the number,variety, and luxuriance of the Greenland Miocene plants are found to have been such that, had land continued so far,some of them would in all probability have flourished at the Pole itself, the problem of changes of climate is broughtprominently into view, but only to be dismissed apparently with the feeling that the time for its solution has not yet arrived.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 727 NO \"MISSING LINK\" ANYWHERE.\"It seems to be admitted on all hands that the Miocene plants of Europe have their nearest and most numerous existinganalogues in North America, and hence arises the question; How was the migration from one area to the other effected?Was there, as some have believed, an Atlantis? -- a continent, or an archipelago of large islands, occupying the area ofthe North Atlantic. There is perhaps nothing unphilosophical in this hypothesis; for since, as geologists state, 'the Alpshave acquired 4,000, and even in some places more than 10,000 feet of their present altitude since the commencementof the Eocene period' (Lyell's Principles, 11th ed., p. 256, 1872), a Post-Miocene (?) depression might have carried thehypothetical Atlantis into almost abysmal depths. But an Atlantis is apparently unnecessary and uncalled for. According toProfessor Oliver, 'A close and very peculiar analogy subsists between the Flora of Tertiary Central Europe and the recentFloras of the American States and of the Japanese region; an analogy much closer and more intimate than is to be tracedbetween the Tertiary and Recent Floras of Europe. We find the Tertiary element of the Old World to be intensifiedtowards its extreme eastern margin. . . . This accession of the Tertiary element is rather gradual and not abruptlyassumed in the Japan islands only. Although it there attains a maximum, we may trace it from the Mediterranean, Levant,Caucasus, and Persia . . . then along the Himalaya and through China. . . . We learn also that during the Tertiary epoch,counterparts of Central European Miocene genera certainly grew in North-West America. . . . We note further that thepresent Atlantic Islands' Flora affords no substantial evidence of a former direct communication with the mainland of theNew World. . . . The consideration of these facts leads me to the opinion that botanical evidence does not favour thehypothesis of an Atlantis. On the other hand, it strongly favours the view that at some period of the Tertiary epoch North-Eastern Asia was united to North-western America, perhaps by the line where the Aleutian chain of islands now extends.'\" (Nat. Hist. Rev. ii. 164, 1862.) See, however, \"Scientific and Geological Proofs of the Reality of Several SubmergedContinents.\""},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"But nothing short of a pithecoid man, will ever satisfy the luckless searchers after the thrice hypothetical \"missing link.\"Yet, if beneath the vast floors of the Atlantic, from the Teneriffe Pic to Gibraltar, the ancient emplacement of the lostAtlantis, all the submarine strata were to be broken up miles deep, no such skull as would satisfy the Darwinists would befound. As Dr. C. R. Bree remarks (\"Fallacies of Darwinism\"), no missing links between man and ape having beendiscovered in various gravels and formations above the tertiaries, if they had gone down with the continents now coveredwith the sea, they------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 728 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.might still be found \"in those beds of contemporary geological strata which have not gone down to the bottom of the sea.\"Yet they are as fatally absent from the latter as from the former. Were not preconceptions to fasten vampire-like on man'smind, the author of \"Antiquity of Man\" would have found a clue to the difficulty in that same work of his, by going tenpages back (530) and reading over a quotation of his own from Professor G. Rolleston's work. This physiologist, he says,suggests that as there is considerable plasticity in the human frame, not only in youth and during growth, but even in theadult, we ought not always to take for granted, as some advocates of the development theory seem to do, that eachadvance in physical power depends on an improvement in bodily structure, for why may not the soul, or the higherintellectual and moral faculties play the first instead of the second part in a progressive scheme.This hypothesis is made in relation to Evolution not being entirely due to \"natural selection\"; but it applies as well to ourcase in hand. For we, too, claim that it is the \"Soul,\" or the inner man, that descends on Earth first, the psychic astral, themould on which physical man is gradually built -- his Spirit, intellectual and moral faculties awakening later on as thatphysical stature grows and develops.\"Thus incorporeal Spirits to smaller forms reduced their shapes immense,\" . . . and became the men of the Third and theFourth Races. Still later, ages after, appeared the men of our Fifth Race, reduced from the still gigantic (in our modernsense) stature of their primeval ancestors, to about half of that size at present.Man is certainly no special creation, and he is the product of Nature's gradual perfective work, like any other living unit onthis Earth. But this is only with regard to the human tabernacle. That which lives and thinks in man and survives thatframe, the masterpiece of evolution -- is the \"Eternal Pilgrim,\" the Protean differentiation in space and time of the OneAbsolute \"unknowable.\"In his \"Antiquity of Man,\" Sir C. Lyell quotes -- perhaps in rather a mocking spirit -- what Hallam says (in Vol. iv., p. 162) inhis \"Introduction to the Literature of Europe\":--\"If man was made in the image of God, he was also made in the image of an ape. The framework of the body of him whohas weighed the stars and made the lightning his slave, approaches to that of a speechless brute who wanders in theforest of Sumatra. Thus standing on the frontier land between animal and angelic natures, what wonder that he shouldpartake of both?\"An Occultist would have put it otherwise. He would say that man was indeed made in the image of a type projected by hisprogenitor, the creating Angel-Force, or Dhyan Chohan; while the wanderer of the forest of Sumatra was made in theimage of man, since the frame-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 729 PALAEOLITHIC MAN, A CALIGRAPH!work of the ape, we say again, is the revival, the resuscitation by abnormal means of the actual form of the Third-Round,and of the Fourth-Round Man as well, later on. Nothing is lost in nature, not an atom: this latter is at least certain onscientific data. Analogy would appear to demand that form should be equally endowed with permanency.And yet what do we find:--\"It is significant,\" says Sir W. Dawson, F.R.S., \"that Professor Huxley in his lectures in New York, while resting his case asto the lower animals, mainly on the supposed genealogy of the horse, which has often been shown to amount to nocertain evidence, avoided altogether the discussion of the origin of men from the apes, now obviously complicated with somany difficulties that both Wallace and Mivart are staggered by them. Professor Thomas in his recent lectures ('Nature,'1876), admits that there is no lower man known than the Australian, and that there is no known link of connection with themonkeys; and that Haeckel has to admit that the penultimate link in his phylogeny, the ape-like man, is absolutelyunknown ('History of Creation.') . . . . The so-called 'tallies' found with the bones of Palaeocosmic men in European caves,and illustrated in the admirable works of Christy and Lartet, show that the rudiments even of writings were already inpossession of the oldest race of men known to archaeology or geology.\" (See Wilson's \"Prehistoric Man,\" op. cit., vol. ii.,p. 54. \"Origin of the World,\" p. 393.)Again in Dr. C. R. Bree's \"Fallacies of Darwinism,\" on page 160, we read:--\"Mr. Darwin justly says that the difference physically and, more especially mentally, between the lowest form of man andthe highest anthropomorphous ape, is enormous. Therefore, the time -- which in Darwinian evolution must be almostinconceivably slow -- must have been enormous also during man's development from the monkey.* The chance,therefore, of some of these variations being found in the different gravels or fresh-water formations above the tertiaries,must be very great. And yet not one single variation, not one single specimen of a being between a monkey and a manhas ever been found. Neither in the gravel, nor the drift-clay, nor the fresh-water beds, nor in the tertiaries below themhas there ever been discovered the remains of any member of the missing families between the monkey and the man, asassumed to have existed by Mr. Darwin. Have they gone down with the depression of the earth's surface and are theynow covered with the sea? If so, it is beyond all probability that they should not, also be found in those beds ofcontemporary geological strata which have not gone down to the bottom of the sea; still more improbable that some"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"portions should not be dredged from the ocean bed like the remains of the mammoth and the rhinoceros which are alsofound in fresh-water beds and gravels and drift! . . . . . . the celebrated Neanderthal skull, about which so much has beensaid, belongs confessedly to this remote epoch (bronze and stone ages), and yet presents, although it may have beenthe skull of an idiot, immense differences from the highest known anthropomorphous ape.\"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* And how much more \"enormous\" if we reverse the subjects and say during the monkey's development from the ThirdRace Man.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 730 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.Our globe being convulsed each time that it reawakens for a new period of activity, like a field which has to be ploughedand furrowed before fresh seed for its new crop is thrown into it -- it does seem quite hopeless that fossils belonging to itsprevious Rounds should be found in the beds of either its oldest or its latest geological strata. Every new Manvantarabrings along with it the renovation of forms, types and species; every type of the preceding organic forms -- vegetable,animal and human -- changes and is perfected in the next, even to the mineral, which has received in this Round its finalopacity and hardness; its softer portions having formed the present vegetation; the astral relics of previous vegetation andfauna having been utilized in the formation of the lower animals, and determining the structure of the primeval Root-Typesof the highest mammalia. And, finally, the form of the gigantic Ape-Man of the former Round has been reproduced in thisone by human bestiality and transfigured into the parent form in the modern Anthropoid.This doctrine, even imperfectly delineated as it is under our inefficient pen, is assuredly more logical, more consistent withfacts, and far more probable than many \"scientific\" theories; that, for instance, of the first organic germ descending on ameteor to our Earth -- like Ain Soph on his Vehicle, Adam Kadmon. Only, the latter descent is allegorical, as every oneknows, and the Kabalists have never offered this figure of speech for acceptance in its dead-letter garb. But the germ onthe meteor theory, as coming from such high scientific quarters, is an eligible candidate for axiomatic truth and law, atheory people are in honour bound to accept, if they would be on a right level with modern Science. What the next theorynecessitated by the materialistic premises will be -- no one can tell. Meanwhile, the present theories, as any one can see,clash together far more discordantly among themselves than even those of the Occultists outside the sacred precincts oflearning. For what is there, next in order, now that exact Science has made even of the Life-principle an empty word, ameaningless term; and now insists that life is an effect due to the molecular action of the primordial protoplasm! The newdoctrine of the Darwinists may be defined and summarized in a few words, in which Mr. Herbert Spencer has defined\"special creation\" . . . \"it is worthless. Worthless, by its derivation; worthless, in its intrinsic incoherence; worthless, asabsolutely without evidence; worthless, as not supplying an intellectual need; worthless, as not satisfying a moral want.We must, therefore, consider it as counting for nothing in opposition to any other hypothesis respecting the origin oforganic beings.\" (Principles of Biology, Vol. I., p. 345.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 731 STILL GREATER DIFFICULTIES.§ V.ORGANIC EVOLUTION AND CREATIVE CENTRES.IT is argued that the Universal Evolution, otherwise, the gradual development of species in all the kingdoms of nature,works by uniform laws. This is admitted, and the law enforced far more strictly in Esoteric than in modern Science. But weare told also, that it is equally a law that \"development works from the less to the more perfect, and from the simpler tothe more complicated, by incessant changes, small in themselves, but constantly accumulating in the required direction.\"It is from the infinitesimally small that the comparatively gigantic species are produced.Esoteric Science agrees with it, but adds that this law applies only to what is known to it as the Primary Creation -- theevolution of worlds from primordial atoms, and the pre-primordial ATOM, at the first differentiation of the former; and thatduring the period of cyclic evolution in space and time, this law is limited and works only in the lower kingdoms. It did sowork during the first geological periods, from simple to complex, on the rough material surviving from the relics of theThird Round, which relics are projected into objectivity when terrestrial activity recommences.No more than Science, does esoteric philosophy admit design or \"special creation.\" It rejects every claim to the\"miraculous,\" and accepts nothing outside the uniform and immutable laws of Nature. But it teaches a cyclic law, a doublestream of force (or spirit) and of matter, which, starting from the neutral centre of Being, develops in its cyclic progressand incessant transformations. The primitive germ from which all vertebrate life has developed throughout the ages,being distinct from the primitive germ from which the vegetable and the animal life have evolved, there are side lawswhose work is determined by the conditions in which the materials to be worked upon are found by them, and of whichScience -- physiology and anthropology especially -- seems to be little aware. Its votaries speak of that \"primitive germ,\"and maintain that it is shown beyond any doubt that the \"design\" and the \"designer,\" if there be any, in the case of man,with the wonderful structure of his limbs, and his hand especially, \"must be placed very much farther back, and (thedesign) is, in fact, involved in the primitive germ,\" from which not only all vertebrate life, but, \"probably all life, animal andvegetable, have been slowly developed\" (p. 94 of \"Modern Science and Modern Thought\").------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 732 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.This is as true of the \"primitive germ\" as it is false that that \"germ\" is only \"very much farther back\" than man is; for it is atan immeasurable and inconceivable distance (in time, though not in space) from the origin even of our Solar system. Asthe Hindu philosophy very justly teaches, the \"Aniyamsam Aniyasam,\" can be known only through false notions. It is the\"many\" that proceed from the ONE -- the living spiritual germs or centres of forces -- each in a septenary form, which firstgenerate, and then give the PRIMARY IMPULSE to the law of evolution and gradual slow development."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Limiting the teaching strictly to this, our earth, it may be shown that, as the ethereal forms of the first Men are firstprojected on seven zones by seven Dhyan-Chohanic centres of Force, so there are centres of creative power for everyROOT or parent species of the host of forms of vegetable and animal life. This is, again, no \"special creation,\" nor is thereany \"Design,\" except in the general \"ground-plan\" worked out by the universal law. But there are certainly \"designers,\"though these are neither omnipotent nor omniscient in the absolute sense of the term. They are simply Builders, orMasons, working under the impulse given them by the ever-to-be-unknown (on our plane) Master Mason -- the ONE LIFEand Law. Belonging to this sphere, they have no hand in, or possibility of working on any other, during the presentManvantara, at any rate. That they work in cycles and on a strictly geometrical and mathematical scale of progression, iswhat the extinct animal species amply demonstrate; that they act by design in the details of minor lives (of side animalissues, etc.) is what natural history has sufficient evidence for. In the creation of new species, departing sometimes verywidely from the Parent stock, as in the great variety of the genus Felis -- like the lynx, the tiger, the cat, etc. -- it is the\"designers\" who direct the new evolution by adding to, or depriving the species of certain appendages, either needed orbecoming useless in the new environments. Thus, when we say that Nature provides for every animal and plant, whetherlarge or small, we speak correctly. For, it is those terrestrial spirits of Nature, who form the aggregated Nature; which, if itfails occasionally in its design, is neither to be considered blind, nor to be taxed with the failure; since, belonging to adifferentiated sum of qualities and attributes, it is in virtue of that alone conditioned and imperfect.Were there no such thing as evolutionary cycles, an eternal spiral progress into matter with a proportionate obscuration ofspirit -- though the two are one -- followed by an inverse ascent into spirit and the defeat of matter -- active and passiveby turn -- how explain the discoveries of zoology and geology?

If theseeming process of development working from the less to the more perfect, and from the simpler to the more complex,were a universal law indeed, instead of being a very imperfect generalization of a mere secondary nature in the greatCosmic process, and if there were no such cycles as those claimed, then the Mesozoic fauna and flora ought to changeplaces with the latest Neolithic. It is the Plesiosauri and the Ichthyosauri that we ought to find developing from the presentsea and river reptiles, instead of giving place to their dwarfed modern analogies. It is, again, our old friend, the good-tempered elephant, that would be the fossil antediluvian ancestor, and the mammoth of the Pliocene age who would be inthe menagerie; the megalonyx and the gigantic megatherium would be found instead of the lazy sloth in the forests ofSouth America, in which the colossal ferns of the carboniferous periods would take the place of moss and present trees --dwarfs, even the giants of California, in comparison with the Titan-trees of past geological periods. Surely the organismsof the megasthenian world of the Tertiary and the Mesozoic Ages must have been more complex and perfect than thoseof the microsthenian plants and animals of the present age? The Dryopithecus, for instance, is found more perfectanatomically, more fit for a greater development of brain power, than the modern gorilla or gibbon? How is this, then? Arewe to believe that the constitution of all those colossal land and sea-dragons, of the gigantic flying reptiles, was not farmore developed and complex than the anatomy of the lizards, turtles, crocodiles, and even of the whales -- in short, allthose animals we are acquainted with?Let us admit, however, for argument's sake, that all those cycles, races, septenary forms of evolution and the tutti quantiof esoteric teaching, are no better than a delusion and a snare. Let us agree with Science and say that man, instead ofbeing an imprisoned \"Spirit,\" and his vehicle, the shell or body, a gradually perfected and now complete mechanism formaterial and terrestrial uses, as claimed by the Occultists -- is simply a more developed animal, whose primal formemerged from one and the same primitive germ on this earth, as the flying dragon and the gnat, the whale and theamoeba, the crocodile and the frog, etc., etc. In this case, he must have passed through the identical developments andthrough the same process of growth as all the other mammals? If man is an animal, and nothing more, a highlyintellectual ex-brute, he should be privileged, at least, and allowed to have been a gigantic mammal of his kind, a------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 734 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.meganthropos in his day. It is just this, that esoteric science shows as having taken place in the first three rounds, and inthis, as in most other things, it is more logical and consistent than modern science. It classifies the human body with thebrute creation, and maintains it in the path of animal evolution, from first to last, while science leaves man a parentlessorphan born of sires unknown, an \"unspecialized skeleton\" truly! And this mistake is due to a stubborn rejection of thedoctrine of cycles.-------A.THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE MAMMALIA: SCIENCE AND THE ESOTERIC PHYLOGENY.Having dealt almost exclusively with the question of the origin of Man in the foregoing criticism of Western Evolutionism, itmay not be amiss to define the position of the Occultists with regard to the differentiation of species. The pre-humanfauna and flora have been already generally dealt with in the Commentary on the Stanzas, and the truth of much ofmodern biological speculation admitted, e.g., the derivation of birds from reptiles, the partial truth of \"natural selection,\"and the transformation theory generally. It now remains to clear up the mystery of the origin of those first mammalianfauna which M. de Quatrefages so brilliantly endeavours to prove as contemporary with the Homo primigenius of theSecondary Age.The somewhat complicated problem relating to the \"Origin of Species,\" -- more especially of the varied groups of fossil orexisting mammalian fauna -- will be rendered less obscure by the aid of a diagram. It will then be apparent to what extentthe \"Factors of Organic Evolution,\" relied upon by Western biologists,* are to be considered as"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Darwinian theory has been so strained, that even Huxley was forced at one time to deprecate its occasionaldegeneration into \"fanaticism.\" Oscar Schmidt presents a good instance of a thinker who unconsciously exaggerates theworth of an hypothesis. He admits (\"The Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,\" p. 158), that \"natural selection\" \"is in somecases . . . inadequate, . . . in others . . . not requisite, as the solution of the formation of species is found in other naturalconditions.\" He also asserts the \"intermediate grades are . . . wanting, which would entitle us to infer with certainty thedirect transition from unplacental to placental mammals\" (p. 271); that \"we are referred entirely to conjecture andinference for the origin of the mammals\" (p. 268); and the repeated failures of the framers of \"hypothetical pedigrees,\"more especially of Haeckel. Nevertheless he asserts on p. 194, that \"what we have gained by the Doctrine of Descentbased on the theory of selection is the KNOWLEDGE of the connection of organisms as 'consanguineous beings.' \"Knowledge in the face of the above-cited concessions, is, then, the synonym for conjecture and theory only?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 735 CONJECTURES ARE NOT FACTS.adequate to meet the facts. The line of demarcation between etherospiritual, astral and physical evolution must be drawn.Perhaps, if Darwinians deigned to consider the possibility of the second process, they would no longer have to lament thefact that \"we are referred to conjecture and inference for the origin of the Mammals\"!! (The Doctrine of Descent andDarwinism, p. 268, by Professor O. Schmidt.) At present the admitted chasm between the systems of reproduction of theoviparous vertebrates and mammalia, constitutes a hopeless crux to those thinkers who, with the Evolutionists, seek tolink all existing organic forms in a continuous line of descent.Let us take -- exempli gratia -- the case of the ungulate mammals. \"In no other division,\" it is said, \"do we possess suchabundant fossil material.\" So much progress has been made in this direction, that in some instances the intermediatelinks between the modern and Eocene ungulates have been unearthed; a notable example being that of the completeproof of the derivation of the present one-toed horse from the three-toed Anchitherium of the old Tertiary. This standard ofcomparison between Western Biology and the Eastern doctrine could not, therefore, be improved upon. The pedigreehere utilized, as embodying the views of scientists in general, is that of Schmidt based on the exhaustive researches ofRutimeyer. Its approximate accuracy -- from the standpoint of evolutionism -- leaves little to be desired:--UNGULATE MAMMALS.[[diagram]][[text in diagram]]ANOPLOTHERIDAEHippopotamiPigsTragulidaeDeerAntelopesOxenPALAEOTHERIDAERhinocerusesTapirsAnchitheriumHipparionHorseMaerauchenidae(EOCENE)(Tertiary)(Recent)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 736 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The midway point of evolution.

Physical causation supervenes immediatelyon the assumption of \"coats of skin\" -- i.e., the physiological equipment in general. The forms of Men and mammaliaprevious to the separation of sexes* are woven out of astral matter, and possess a structure utterly unlike that of thephysical organisms, which eat, drink, digest, etc., etc., etc. The known physiological contrivances in organisms werealmost entirely evolved subsequently to the incipient physicalization of the 7 Root-Types out of the astral -- during the\"midway halt\" between the two planes of existence. Hardly had the \"ground-plan\" of evolution been limned out in theseancestral types, than the influence of the accessory terrestrial laws, familiar to us, supervened, resulting in the whole cropof mammalian species. AEons of slow differentiation were, however, required to effect this end.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Bear in mind, please, that though the animals -- mammalians included -- have all been evolved after and partially fromman's cast-off tissues, still, as a far lower being, the mammalian animal became placental and separated far earlier thanman.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 737 THE UNITY OF TYPE.No. II. represents the domain of the purely astral prototypes previous to their descent into (gross) matter. Astral matter, itmust be noted, is fourth state matter, having, like our gross matter, its own \"protyle.\" There are several \"protyles\" inNature, corresponding to the various planes of matter. The two sub-physical elemental kingdoms, the plane of mind(manas, the fifth state matter), as also that of Buddhi (sixth state matter), are each and all evolved from one of the six\"protyles\" which constitute the basis of the Object-Universe. The three \"states,\" so-called of our terrestrial matter, knownas the \"solid,\" \"liquid,\" and \"gaseous,\" are only, in strict accuracy, SUB-states. As to the former reality of the descent intothe physical, which culminated in physiological man and animal, we have a palpable testimony in the fact of the so-calledspiritualistic \"materializations.\"In all these instances a complete temporary mergence of the astral into the physical takes place. The evolution ofphysiological Man out of the astral races of early Lemurian age -- the Jurassic age of Geology -- is exactly paralleled bythe \"materialization\" of \"spirits\" (?) in the seance-room. In the case of Professor Crookes' \"Katie King,\" the presence of aphysiological mechanism -- heart, lungs, etc. -- was indubitably demonstrated!!This, in a way, is the ARCHETYPE of Goethe. Listen to his words: \"Thus much we should have gained . . . all the nineperfect organic beings . . . (are) formed according to an archetype which merely fluctuates more or less in its verypersistent parts and, moreover, day by day, completes and transforms itself by means of reproduction.\" This is aseemingly imperfect foreshadowing of the occult fact of the differentiation of species from the primal astral root-types.Whatever the whole posse comitatus of \"natural selection,\" etc., etc., may effect, the fundamental unity of structural planremains practically unaffected by all subsequent modifications. The \"Unity of Type\" common, in a sense, to all the animaland human kingdoms, is not, as Spencer and others appear to hold, a proof of the consanguineity of all organic forms,but a witness to the essential unity of the \"ground-plan\" Nature has followed in fashioning her creatures.To sum up the case, we may again avail ourselves of a tabulation of the actual factors concerned in the differentiation ofspecies. The stages of the process itself need no further comment here, being the basic principles underlying organicdevelopment, than to enter on the domain of the biological specialist.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 738 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.FACTORS CONCERNED IN THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES, ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE.BASIC ASTRAL PROTOTYPES PASS INTO THE PHYSICAL.-------The Dhyan Chohanic Impulse constituting Lamarck's \"inherent and necessary\" law of development.

Littre's contention as to the balmy spring of the Quaternary -- to which deposits M. de Perthes' discoveries of flintimplements are traceable (since when the Somme has worn down its valley many scores of feet) -- must be acceptedwith much reservation. The Somme-valley relics are post-glacial, and possibly point to the immigration of savages duringone of the more temperate periods intervening between minor ages of Ice.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 739 AFRICA IN EUROPE.those \"periods\" and then adds: (b) \"Spring, professor of the Faculty of Medicine at Liege, found in a grotto near Namur, inthe mountain of Chauvaux, numerous human bones 'of a race quite distinct from ours.' \"Skulls exhumed in Austria offered a great analogy with those of African negro races, according to Littre, while others,discovered on the shores of the Danube and the Rhine, resembled the skulls of the Caribs and those of the ancientinhabitants of Peru and Chili. Still, the Deluge, whether Biblical or Atlantean, was denied. But further geologicaldiscoveries having made Gaudry write conclusively: \"Our forefathers were positively contemporaneous with therhinoceros tichorrhinus, the hippopotamus major\"; and add that the soil called diluvial in geology \"was formed partially atleast after man's apparition on earth\" -- Littre pronounced himself finally. He then showed the necessity, before \"theresurrection of so many old witnesses,\" of rehandling all the origins, all the durations, and added that there was AN AGEhitherto unknown to study \"either at the dawn of the actual epoch or, as I believe, at the beginning of the epoch whichpreceded it.\"The types of the skulls found in Europe are of two kinds, as is well known: the orthognathous and the prognathous, or theCaucasian and the negro types; such as are now found only in the African and the lower savage tribes. Professor Heer --who argues that the facts of Botany necessitate the hypothesis of an Atlantis -- has shown that the plants of the Neolithiclake-villagers are mainly of African origin. How did the latter come to be in Europe if there was no former point of unionbetween Africa and Europe? How many thousand years ago did the seventeen men live whose skeletons were exhumedin the Department of the Haute Garonne, in a squatting posture near the remains of a coal fire, with some amulets andbroken crockery around them, and in company with the bear spelaeus, the Elephas primigenius, the aurochs (regardedby Cuvier as a distinct species), the Megaceros hibernicus -- all antediluvian mammals? Certainly at a most distantepoch, but not one which carries us further back than the Quaternary. A much greater antiquity for Man has yet to beproved. Dr. James Hunt, the late President of the Anthropological Society, makes it 9,000,000 years. This man ofscience, at any rate, makes some approach to our esoteric computation, if we leave the first two semi-human, etherealraces, and the early Third Race out of the computation.The question, however, arises -- who were these Palaeolithic men of the European quaternary epoch? Were theyaboriginal, or the outcome of some immigration dating back into the unknown past? The latter is the only tenablehypothesis, as all scientists agree in eliminating Europe from the category of possible \"cradles of mankind.\" Whence,then, radiated the various successive streams of \"primitive\" men?------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 740 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.The earliest Palaeolithic men in Europe -- about whose origin Ethnology is silent, and whose very characteristics are butimperfectly known, though expatiated on as \"ape-like\" by imaginative writers such as Mr. Grant Allen -- were of pureAtlantean and \"Africo\"-Atlantean stocks.* (It must be borne in mind that by this time the Atlantis continent itself was adream of the past.) Europe in the quaternary epoch was very different from the Europe of to-day, being then only inprocess of formation. It was united to N. Africa -- or rather what is now N. Africa -- by a neck of land running across thepresent Straits of Gibraltar -- N. Africa thus constituting a species of extension of Spain, while a broad sea washed thegreat basin of the Sahara. Of the great Atlantis, the main bulk of which sank in the Miocene, there remained only Rutaand Daitya and a stray island or so. The Atlantean connections of the forefathers** of the Palaeolithic cave-men areevidenced by the upturning of fossil skulls (in Europe) reverting closely to the West Indian Carib and ancient Peruviantype -- a mystery indeed to all those who refuse to sanction the \"hypothesis\" of a former Atlantic continent to bridge theocean (Cf. \"Scientific and geological proofs of the reality of several submerged continents\"). What are we also to make ofthe fact that while de Quatrefages points to that \"magnificent race,\" the TALL Cro-Magnon cave-men and the Guanchesof the Canary Islands as representatives of one type -- Virchow also allies the Basques with the latter in a similar way?Professor Retzius independently proves the relationship of the aboriginal American dolichocephalous tribes and thesesame Guanches. The several links in the chain of evidence are securely joined together. Legions of similar facts could beadduced. As to the African tribes -- themselves diverging offshoots of Atlanteans modified by climate and conditions --they crossed into Europe over the peninsula which made the Mediterranean an inland sea. Fine races were many ofthese European cave-men; the Cro-Magnon, for instance. But, as was to be expected, progress is almost non-existentthrough the whole of the vast period allotted[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"* \"Whence they (the old cave-men) came, we cannot tell\" (Grant Allen).\"The palaeolithic hunters of the Somme Valley did not originate in that inhospitable climate, but moved into Europe fromsome more genial region -- (Dr. Southall \"Epoch of the Mammoth\" p. 315).** The pure Atlantean stocks -- of which the tall quaternary cave-men were, in part, the direct descendants -- immigratedinto Europe long prior to the Glacial Period; in fact as far back as the Pliocene and Miocene times in the Tertiary. Theworked Miocene flints of Thenay, and the traces of Pliocene man discovered by Professor Capellini in Italy, are witnessesto the fact.

Finally, Palaeolithic man makes room for his successor -- anddisappears almost entirely from the scene. Professor Lefevre asks in this connection:--\"Has the Polished succeeded the Chipped Stone-Age by an imperceptible transition, or was it due to an invasion ofbrachycephalous Celts? But whether, again, the deterioration produced in the populations of La Vezere was the result ofviolent crossings, or of a general retreat northwards in the wake of the reindeer, is of little moment to us.\" He continues:--\"Meantime the bed of the ocean has been upheaved, Europe is now fully formed, her flora and fauna fixed. With thetaming of the dog begins the pastoral life. We enter on those polished stone and bronze periods, which succeed eachother at irregular intervals, which even overlap one another in the midst of ethnical fusions and migrations. . . . Theprimitive European populations are interrupted in their special evolution and, without perishing, become absorbed in otherraces, engulfed . . . by successive waves of migration overflowing from Africa, possibly from a lost Atlantis [?? far too lateby aeons of years] and from prolific Asia . . . all FORERUNNERS OF THE GREAT ARYAN INVASION\" (Fifth Race).[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The artistic skill displayed by the old cave-men renders the hypothesis which regards them as approximations to the\"pithecanthropus alalus\" -- that very mythical Haeckelian monster -- an absurdity requiring no Huxley or Schmidt toexpose it.

Is this possible? Yes; for evidence of thisnature is plentiful, and has simply to be collected and brought together to become overwhelming in the eyes of theunprejudiced.Once the sagacious student gets hold of the guiding thread he may find it out for himself. We give facts and show land-marks: let the wayfarer follow them. What is given here is amply sufficient for THIS Century.In a letter to Voltaire, Bailly finds it quite natural that the sympathies of the \"grand old invalid of Ferney\" should beattracted to the \"representatives of knowledge and wisdom, the Brahmans of India.\" He then adds a curious statement.\"But,\" he says, \"your Brahmans are very young in comparison with their ancient instructors.\"*Bailly, who knew nought of the esoteric teachings, nor of Lemuria, believed, nevertheless, unreservedly in the lostAtlantis, and also in several pre-historic and civilized nations which had disappeared without leaving any undeniabletrace. He had studied the ancient classics and traditions extensively, and he saw that the arts and sciences known tothose we now call the \"ancients,\" were \"not the achievements of any of the now or even then existing nations, nor of anyof the historical peoples of Asia.\" And that, notwithstanding the learning of the Hindoos, their undeniable priority in theantiquity of their race had to be referred to a people or a race still more ancient and more learned than were even theBrahmans themselves.**Voltaire, the greatest sceptic of his day, the materialist par excellence, shared Bailly's belief. He thought it quite likely \"thatlong before the empires of China and India, there had been nations cultured, learned, and powerful, which a deluge ofbarbarians overpowered and thus replunged into their primitive state of ignorance and savagery, or what they call thestate of pure nature.\" (\"Lettres sur l'Atlantide,\" p. 15).***[[Footnote(s)]] -----------------------------------------------* Lettres sur l'Atlantide.** Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne, p. 25, et seq."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"*** This conjecture is but a half-guess.

(Ibid.) It was possible,he thought, that a foreign nation should, after instructing another nation, so disappear that it should leave no tracesbehind. When asked how it could have happened that this ancient, or rather archaic, nation should not have left at leastsome recollection in the human mind, he answered that Time was a pitiless devourer of facts and events. But, the historyof the Past was never entirely lost, for the Sages of old Egypt had preserved it, and \"it is so preserved to this dayelsewhere.\" \"You do not know which was the best and most handsome generation of men which has ever lived on thisearth,\" said the priests of Sais to Solon, according to Plato. \"Only a weak seed of it, of which you (Greeks) are thedescendants,* is all that remains.\" \"Their books,\" they added, \"preserved the records of a great nation, which emergingfrom the Atlantic sea had invaded Europe and Asia (Timaeus). The Greeks were but the dwarfed and weak remnant ofthat once glorious nation. . . .\"**What was this nation? The secret doctrine teaches that it was the latest, seventh sub-race of the Atlanteans, alreadyswallowed up in one of the early sub-races of the Aryan stock, one that had been gradually spreading over the continentand islands of Europe, as soon as they had begun to emerge from the seas. Descending from the high plateaux of Asia,where the two Races had sought refuge in the days of the agony of Atlantis, it had been slowly settling and colonizing thefreshly emerged lands. The emigrant sub-race had rapidly increased and multiplied on that virgin soil; had divided intomany families, which in their turn divided into nations. Egypt and Greece, the Phoenicians, and the Northern stocks, hadthus proceeded from that one sub-race. Thousands of years later, other races -- the remnants of the Atlanteans -- \"yellowand red, brown and black,\" began to invade the new continent. There were wars in which the new comers were defeated;and they fled, some to Africa, others to remote countries. Some of these lands became in course of time -- owing to newgeological convulsions -- islands. Being thus forcibly[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* For a full discussion of the relations between the old Greeks and Romans, and the Atlantean colonists, cf. \"Five Yearsof Theosophy.\"** The story about Atlantis and all the traditions thereon were told, as all know, by Plato in his \"Timaeus and Critias.\"Plato, when a child, had it from his grand-sire Critias, aged ninety, who in his youth had been told of it by Solon, his fatherDropidas' friend -- Solon, one of the Grecian Seven Sages.

It is this presence of a type associated with that ofthe negro, and also with that of the Mongolian, which is the stumbling-block of anthropology. The individual who lived atan incalculably distant period at La Naulette, in Belgium (Vide Dr. Carter Blake's paper \"On the Naudette Jaw,\" Anthrop.Review, Sept., 1867), is an example. \"The caves on the banks of the Lesse, in South-Eastern Belgium,\" says thisAnthropologist, \"afford evidence of what is, perhaps, the lowest man, as shown by the Naulette jaw. Such man, however,had amulets of stone, perforated for the purpose of ornament; these are made of a psammite now found in the basin ofthe Gironde.\"Thus Belgian man was extremely ancient. That man who was antecedent to the great flood of waters -- which covered thehighlands of Belgium with a deposit of lehm or upland gravel 30 metres above the level of the present rivers -- must havecombined the characters of the Turanian and the negro. The Canstadt, or La Naulette, man, may have been black, andhad nothing to do with the Aryan type whose remains are contemporary with those of the cave bear at Engis. Thedenizens of the Aquitaine bone-caves belong to a far later period of history, and may not be as ancient as the former.If the statement is objected to on the ground that Science does not deny the presence of man on earth from an enormousantiquity, though that antiquity cannot be determined, since that presence is conditioned by the duration of geologicalperiods, the age of which is not ascertained; if it is argued that the Scientists object most decidedly to the claim that manpreceded the animals, for instance; or that civilization dates from the earliest Eocene period, or, again, that there haveever existed giants, three-eyed and four-armed and four-legged men, androgynes, etc., then the objectors are asked intheir turn, \"How do you know? What proof have you besides your personal hypotheses, each of which may be upset anyday by new discoveries?\" And these future discoveries are sure to prove that, whatever this earlier type of man known toAnthropologists was in complexion, he was in no respect apish. The Canstadt man, the Engis man alike possessedessentially human attributes.

All they say is mere arbitrary speculative guess-work, invented by them to answer to and fit in with their ownfanciful theories.We speak of events hundreds of thousands years old, nay, even millions -- if man dates from the geological periods* --not of any of those events which happened during the few thousand years of the pre-historic margin allowed by timid andever-cautious history. Yet there are men of science who are almost of our way of thinking. From the brave confession ofthe Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg, who says that:-- \"Traditions, whose traces recur in Mexico, in Central America, in Peru,and in Bolivia, suggest the idea that man existed in these different countries at the time of the gigantic upheaval of theAndes, and that he has retained the memory of it\" -- down to the latest palaeontologists and anthropologists, the majorityof scientific men is in favour of just such an antiquity. Apropos of Peru, has any satisfactory attempt been made todetermine the ethnological affinities and characteristics of the race which reared those Cyclopean erections, the ruins ofwhich display the relics of a great civilization? At Cuelap, for instance, such are found, consisting \"of a wall of wroughtstones, 3,600 feet long, 560 broad, and 150 feet high, constituting a solid mass with a level summit. On this mass wasanother, 600 feet long, 500 broad, and 150 feet high, making an aggregate height of 300 feet. In it were rooms and cells.\"(Cf., the mass of evidence collected by Donnelly to prove the Peruvian colony an offshoot of the Atlanteans.) A mostsuggestive fact is the startling resemblance between the architecture of these colossal buildings and that of the archaicEuropean nations. Mr. Fergusson regards the analogies between the ruins of \"Inca\" civilization and the Cyclopeanremains of the Pelasgians in Italy and Greece as a coincidence \"the most remarkable in the history of architecture.\" \"It isdifficult to resist the conclusion that there may be some relation between them.\" The \"relation\" is simply explained by thederivation of the stocks,[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Haeckel's \"Man-ape\" of the Miocene period is the dream of a monomaniac, which de Quatrefages (see his \"HumanSpecies,\" pp. 105-113) has cleverly disposed of. It is not clear why the world should accept the lucubrations of apsychophobic materialist, (to accept whose theory necessitates the acceptance on faith of various animals unknown toScience or Nature -- like the Sozura, for instance, that amphibian which has never existed anywhere outside Haeckel'simagination), rather than the traditions of antiquity.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 746 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.who devised these erections, from a common centre in an Atlantic continent. The acceptance of the latter can aloneassist us to approach a solution of this and similar problems in almost every branch of modern science.Dr. Lartet, treating upon the subject, settles the question by declaring that:-- \"The truth, so long contested, of the co-existence of man with the great extinct species (Elephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorrhinus, Hyaena spelaea, Ursusspelaeus, etc., etc.), appears to me to be henceforth unassailable and definitely conquered by science.\" (\"Cavernes dePerigord,\" p. 35.)It is shown elsewhere that such is also de Quatrefages' opinion. \"Man has in all probability seen Miocene times* andconsequently the entire Pliocene epoch,\" he says, and there are reasons for believing that \"his traces will be found furtherback still, . . . .\" he adds (\"The Human Species,\" p. 152.)Egypt is far older than Europe as now traced on the map. Atlanto-Aryan tribes began to settle on it, when the BritishIslands** and France were not even in existence. It is well known that \"the tongue of the AEgyptian Sea,\" or the Delta oflower Egypt, became firm land very gradually, and followed the highlands of Abyssinia; unlike the latter, which arosesuddenly, comparatively speaking, it was very slowly formed, through long ages, from successive layers of sea slime andmud, deposited annually by the soil brought down by a large river, the present Nile. Yet even the Delta as a firm andfertile land, has been inhabited for more than 100,000 years. Later tribes, with still more Aryan blood in them than theirpredecessors, arrived from the East, and conquered it from a people whose very name is lost to posterity, except inSecret works. It is this natural barrier of slime, which sucked in slowly and surely every boat that approached theseinhospitable shores, that was, till within a few thousand of years B.C., the best safeguard of the later Egyptians, who hadmanaged to reach it through Arabia, Abyssinia, and Nubia, led on by Manu Vina in the day of Visvamitra. (See in \"IsisUnveiled,\" vol. 1, p. 627, what Kulluka Bhatta says.) So evident does the antiquity of man become with every day that even the Church is preparing an honourable surrenderand retreat. The learned Abbe Fabre, professor at the Sorbonne, has categorically declared[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The ingenious author of \"Atlantis, the Ante-diluvian World,\" in discussing the origin of various Grecian and Romaninstitutions, expresses his conviction that \"the roots of the institutions of to-day reach back to the Miocene Age.\" Ay, andfurther yet, as already stated.** As we know them, however. For not only does Geology prove that the British islands have been four times submergedand re-elevated, but that the straits between them and Europe were dry land at a remote former epoch.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 747 THE SEVEN SABBATHS.that pre-historic palaeontology and archaeology may, without any harm to the Scriptures, discover in the tertiary beds . . .. . the traces of pre-adamite man as much as they like. \"Since it disregards all creations anterior to the last deluge butone, (that which produced the diluvium, according to the Abbe), Bible revelation leaves us free to admit the existence ofman in the grey diluvium, in Pliocene, and even Eocene strata.

For such allusions to the Septenary constitution of the Earth and Man, to the seven Rounds andRaces, abound in the New as in the Old Testaments, and are as visible as the sun in the heavens to him who reads bothsymbolically.

And if this interpretation from Leviticus (full of thedisfigured laws of Manu) is found too far-fetched, then turn to Revelation. Whatever interpretation profane mystics maygive to the famous Chapter xvii., with its riddle of the woman in purple and scarlet; whether Protestants nod at the RomanCatholics, when reading \"MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OFTHE EARTH,\" or Roman Catholics glare at the Protestants, the Occultists pronounce, in their impartiality, that thesewords have applied from the first to all and every exoteric Churchianity, that which was the \"ceremonial magic\" of old, withits terrible effects, and is now the harmless (because distorted) farce of ritualistic worship. The \"mystery\" of the womanand of the beast, are the symbols of soul-killing Churchianity and of SUPERSTITION. \"The beast that was, and is not,and yet is.\" \"And here is the Mind which hath wisdom.

These five Kings werementioned before.If the Bible combines with archaeology and geology to show that human civilization has passed through three more orless distinct stages, in Europe at least; and if man, both in America and Europe, as much as in Asia, dates fromgeological epochs -- why should not the statements of the Secret Doctrine be taken into consideration?

Even so late as the time of Herodotus, theyhad still in their possession the statues of 341 kings who had reigned over their little Atlanto-Aryan Sub-race (Vide aboutthe latter \"Esoteric Buddhism,\" p. 66, Fifth Edition.) If one allows only twenty years as an average figure for the reign ofeach King, the duration of the Egyptian Empire has to be pushed back, from the day of Herodotus, about 17,000 years.Bunsen allowed the great Pyramid an antiquity of 20,000 years. More modern archaeologists will not give it more than5,000, or at the utmost 6,000 years; and generously concede to Thebes with its hundred gates, 7,000 years from the dateof its foundation. And yet there are records which show Egyptian priests -- Initiates -- journeying in a North-Westerlydirection, by land, via what became later the Straits of Gibraltar; turning North and travelling through the future Phoeniciansettlements of Southern Gaul; then still further North, until reaching Carnac (Morbihan) they turned to the West again andarrived, still travelling by land, on the North-Western promontory of the New Continent.**What was the object of their long journey?

The fact of their crossing from France to Great Britain byland may give an idea of the date when such a journey could have been performed on terra firma.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"In making soundings in the stony soil of the Nile Valley two baked bricks were discovered, one at the depth of 20, theother at 25 yards.

Yet, these weird, and often colossal monuments of unhewn stones -- which consist generally of fouror seven gigantic blocks placed together -- are strewn over Asia, Europe, America, and Africa, in groups or rows. Stonesof enormous size are found placed horizontally and variously upon two, three, four, and as in Poitou, upon six and sevenblocks. People name them \"devil's altars,\" druidic stones, and giant tombs. The stones of Carnac in the Morbihan,Brittany -- nearly a mile in length and numbering 11,000 ranged in eleven rows -- are twin sisters of those at Stonehenge.The Conical menhir of Loch-Maria-ker in Morbihan, measures twenty yards in length and nearly two yards across. TheMenhir of Champ Dolent (near St. Malo) rises thirty feet above the ground, and is fifteen feet in depth below. Suchdolmens and prehistoric monuments are met with in almost every latitude. They are found in the Mediterranean basin; inDenmark (among the local tumuli from twenty-seven to thirty-five feet in height); in Shetland, and in Sweden, where theyare called ganggriften (or tombs with corridors); in Germany, where they are known as the giant tombs (Hunengraben); inSpain (see the dolmen of Antiguera near Malaga), and Africa; in Palestine and Algeria; in Sardinia (see the Nuraghi andSepolture dei giganti, or tombs of giants); in Malabar, in India, where they are called the tombs of the Daityas (giants) andof the Rakshasas, the men-demons of Lanka; in Russia and Siberia, where they are known as the Koorgan; in Peru andBolivia, where they are termed the chulpas or burial places, etc., etc., etc.There is no country from which they are absent. Who built them? Why are they all connected with Serpents and Dragons,with Alligators and Crocodiles? Because remains of \"palaeolithic man\" were, it is thought, found in some of them, andbecause in the funeral mounds of America bodies of later races were discovered with the usual paraphernalia of bonenecklaces, weapons, stone and copper urns, etc., hence they are declared ancient tombs. But surely the two famousmounds -- one in the Mississippi valley and the other in Ohio -- known respectively as \"the Alligator Mound\" and \"theGreat Serpent [[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The scientific \"jury\" disagreed, as usual; while de Quatrefages, de Mortillet, Worsaae, Engelhardt, Waldemar, Schmidt,Capellini, Hamy, and Cartailhac, saw upon the flints the traces of human handiwork, Steenstrup, Virchow and Desorrefused to do so.

Yet one is told authoritatively that the Mounds, and the Mound orDolmen Builders, are all \"Pelasgic\" in Europe, antecedent to the Incas, in America, yet of \"not extremely distant times.\"They are built by \"no race of Dolmen Builders,\" which never existed (opinion of De Mortillet, Bastian, and Westropp) savein the earlier archeological fancy. Finally Virchow's opinion of the giant tombs of Germany is now accepted as an axiom:--\"The tombs alone are gigantic, and not the bones they contain\" -- says that German biologist; and archaeology has but tobow and submit to the decision.**That no gigantic skeletons have been hitherto found in the \"tombs\" is yet no reason to say there never were the remainsof giants in them. Cremation was universal till a comparatively recent period -- some 80, or 100,000 years ago. The realgiants, moreover, were nearly all drowned with Atlantis. Nevertheless, the classics, as shown elsewhere, often speak ofgiant skeletons still excavated in their day. Besides this, human fossils may be counted on the fingers, as yet. Noskeleton ever yet found is older than between 50, or 60,000 years,*** and man's size was reduced from 15 to 10 or 12feet, ever since the third sub-race of the Aryan stock, which sub-race -- born and developed in Europe and Asia Minorunder new climates and conditions -- had become European. Since then, as said, it has steadily been decreasing. It istruer therefore to say, that the tombs alone are archaic, and not necessarily the bodies of men occasionally found inthem; and that those tombs, since they are gigantic, must have contained giants,**** or rather the ashes of generations ofgiants."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* We take the following description from a scientific work. \"The first of these animals (the alligator) designed withconsiderable skill, is no less than 250 ft. long. . . . .

It is with the so-called Druidical remains, such as Carnacin Brittany and Stonehenge in Great Britain, that the travelling Initiates above alluded to had to do. And these giganticmonuments are all symbolic records of the World's history. They are not Druidical, but universal. Nor did the Druids buildthem, for they were only the heirs to the cyclopean lore left to them by generations of mighty builders and -- \"magicians,\"both good and bad.It will always be a subject of regret that history, rejecting a priori the actual existence of giants, has preserved us so littleof the records of antiquity concerning them. Yet in nearly every mythology -- which after all is ancient history -- the giantsplay an important part. In the old Norse mythology, the giants, Skrymir and his brethren, against whom the sons of thegods fought, were potent factors in the histories of deities and men. The modern exegesis, that makes these giants to bethe brethren of the dwarfs, and reduces the combats of the gods to the history of the development of the Aryan race, willonly receive credence amongst the believers in the Aryan theory, as expounded by Max Muller. Granting that theTuranian races were typified by the dwarfs (Dwergar), and that a dark, round-headed, and dwarfish race was drivennorthward by the fair-faced Scandinavians, or AEsir, the gods being like unto men, there still exists neither in history norany other scientific work any anthropological proof whatever of the existence in time or space of a race of giants. Yet thatsuch exist, relatively and de facto side by side with dwarfs, Schweinfurth can testify. The Nyam-Nyam of Africa areregular dwarfs, while their next neighbours (several tribes of comparatively fair-complexioned Africans) are giants whenconfronted with the Nyam-Nyams, and very tall even among Europeans, for their women are all above 6 1/2 feet high.(Vide Schweinfurth's latest works.)In Cornwall and in ancient Britain the traditions of these giants are, on the other hand, excessively common; they are saidto live even down to the time of King Arthur. All this shows that giants lived to a later date amongst the Celtic than amongthe Teutonic peoples.If we turn to the New World, we have traditions of a race of giants at Tarija on the eastern slopes of the Andes and inEcuador, who combated gods and men. These old beliefs, which term certain localities \"Los campos de los gigantes\" --\"the fields of giants,\" are always concomitant with the existence of pliocene mammalia and the occurrence of plioceneraised beaches. \"All the giants are not under Mount Ossa,\" and it would be poor anthropology indeed that would restrictthe traditions of giants to Greek and Bible mythologies. Slavonian countries, Russia especially, teem with legends aboutthe bogaterey (mighty giants)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 755 RACES OF GIANTS.of old; and their folklore, most of which has served for the foundation of national histories, their oldest songs, and theirmost archaic traditions, speak of the giants of old. Thus we may safely reject the modern theory that would make of theTitans mere symbols standing for cosmic forces. They were real living men, whether twenty or only twelve feet high. Eventhe Homeric heroes, who, of course, belonged to a far more recent period in the history of the races, appear to havewielded weapons of a size and weight beyond the strength of the strongest men of modern times.\"Not twice ten men the mighty bulk could raise,Such men as live in these degenerate days.\"If the fossil footprints from Carson, Indiana, U.S.A., are human, they indicate gigantic men. Of their genuineness therecan remain no doubt. It is to be deplored that the modem and scientific evidence for gigantic men should rest onfootprints alone. Over and over again, the skeletons of hypothetical giants have been identified with those of elephantsand mastodons. But all such blunders before the days of geology, and even the traveller's tales of Sir John Mandeville,who says that he saw giants 56 feet high, in India, only show that belief in the existence of giants has never, at any time,died out of the thoughts of men.That which is known and accepted is, that several races of gigantic men have existed and left distinct traces. In thejournal of the Anthropological Institute (Vol. 1871, art. by Dr. C. Carter Blake) such a race is shown as having existed atPalmyra and possibly in Midian, exhibiting cranial forms quite different from those of the Jews. It is not improbable thatanother such race existed in Samaria, and that the mysterious people who built the stone circles in Galilee, hewed"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"neolithic flints in the Jordan valley and preserved an ancient Semitic language quite distinct from the square Hebrewcharacter -- was of a very large stature. The English translations of the Bible can never be relied upon, even in theirmodern revised forms. They tell us of the Nephilim translating the word by \"giants,\" and further adding that they were\"hairy\" men, probably the large and powerful prototypes of the later satyrs so eloquently described by the patristic fancy;some of the Church Fathers assuring their admirers and followers that they had themselves seen these \"Satyrs\" -- somealive, others pickled and preserved. The word \"giants\" being once adopted as a synonym of Nephilim, the commentatorshave since identified them with the sons of Anak. The filibusters who seized on the Promised Land, found a pre-existingpopulation far exceeding their own in stature, and called it a race of giants. But the races of really gigantic men haddisappeared ages before the birth of Moses. This tall people existed in Canaan, and------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 756 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.even in Bashan, and may have had representatives in the Nabatheans of Midian. They were of far greater stature thanthe undersized Jews. Four thousand years ago their cranial conformation and large stature separated them from thechildren of Heber. Forty thousand years ago their ancestors may have been of still more gigantic size, and four hundredthousand years earlier they must have been in proportion to men in our days as the Brobdingnagians were to theLilliputians. The Atlanteans of the middle period were called the Great Dragons, and the first symbol of their tribal deities,when the \"gods\" and the Divine Dynasties had forsaken them, was that of a giant Serpent.The mystery veiling the origin and the religion of the Druids, is as great as that of their supposed fanes is to the modernSymbologist, but not to the initiated Occultists. Their priests were the descendants of the last Atlanteans, and what isknown of them is sufficient to allow the inference that they were eastern priests akin to the Chaldeans and Indians,though little more. It may be inferred that they symbolized their deity as the Hindus do their Vishnu, as the Egyptians didtheir Mystery God, and as the builders of the Ohio Great-Serpent mound worshipped theirs -- namely under the form ofthe \"mighty Serpent,\" the emblem of the eternal deity TIME (the Hindu Kala). Pliny called them the \"Magi of the Gauls andBritons.\" But they were more than that. The author of \"Indian Antiquities\" finds much affinity between the Druids and theBrahmins of India. Dr. Borlase points to a close analogy between them and the Magi of Persia*; others will see an identitybetween them and the Orphic priesthood of Thrace: simply because they were connected, in their esoteric teachings, withthe universal Wisdom Religion, and thus presented affinities with the exoteric worship of all.Like the Hindus, the Greeks and Romans (we speak of the Initiates), the Chaldees and the Egyptians, the Druids believedin the doctrine of a succession of worlds, as also in that of seven \"creations\" (of new continents) and transformations ofthe face of the earth, and in a seven-fold night and day for each earth or globe (See \"Esoteric Buddhism\"). Wherever theSerpent with the egg is found, there this tenet was surely present. Their Dracontia are a proof of it. This belief was souniversal that, if we seek for it in the esotericism of various religions, we shall discover it in all. We shall find it among theAryan Hindus and Mazdeans, the Greeks, the Latins, and even among the old Jews and early Christians, whose modernstocks[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* But the Magi of Persia were never Persians -- not even Chaldeans. They came from a far-off land, the Orientalists beingof opinion that the said land was Media. This may be so, but from what part of Media?

See what Seneca says in Epistle 9, and Quaest. Nat. III.,c., ult.: \"The world being melted and having re-entered the bosom of Jupiter, this god continues for some time to remainabsorbed in himself and concealed, wholly immersed in contemplation. After which a new world springs from him. . . . Aninnocent race of men and animals are produced anew . . . etc.\" Then again when speaking of periodical mundanedissolution involving universal death, he (Seneca) says that \"when the laws of nature shall be buried in ruin, and the lastday of the world shall come, the southern pole shall crush, as it falls, all the regions of Africa, and the North pole shalloverwhelm all the countries beneath its axis. The affrighted sun shall be deprived of its light; the palace of heaven fallingto decay shall produce at once both life and death, and some kind of dissolution shall equally seize upon all deities, whothus shall return into their original chaos\" (Quoted in \"Book of God,\" p. 160.)One might imagine oneself reading the Puranic account by Parasara of the great Pralaya. It is nearly the same thing, ideafor idea. Has Christianity nothing of the kind? It has, we say. Let the reader open any English Bible and read chapter iii. ofthe Second Epistle of Peter, from verse iii. till the xivth, and he will find there the same ideas. . . . \"There shall come in thelast days scoffers . . . saying, 'where is the promise of his coming? . . . . Since the fathers fell asleep all things continue asthey were from the beginning of creation.' For, they are ignorant . . . . that by the word of God the heavens were of old,and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,perished. But the heavens and the earth that are now, are reserved unto the fire . . . . wherein the heavens . . . . shall bedissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat . . . . we nevertheless look for new heavens and new earth, etc.,etc.\" If the interpreters chose to see in this a reference to creation, the deluge, and the promised coming of Christ, whenthey will live in a new Jerusalem in heaven, this is no fault of \"Peter.\" What the writer of the Epistles meant was thedestruction of this Fifth Race of ours by subterranean fires and inundations, and the appearance of new continents for theSixth Root-Race. For the writers of these Epistles were all learned in symbology if not in the sciences.It was mentioned elsewhere that the belief in the septenary constitution of our \"chain\" was the oldest tenet of the earlyIranians, who got it from the first Zarathustra. It is time to prove it to those Parsis who have lost the key to the meaning oftheir Scriptures. In the Avesta the earth is considered septempartite and tripartite at one and the same time. This isregarded by Dr. Geiger, as an incongruity, for the following reasons, which he calls discrepancies: the Avesta speaks------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 758 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"of the three-thirds of the earth because the Rig-Veda mentions \"three earths.\" . . . . \"Three strata or layers, one lyingabove the other, are said to be meant by this.\"* But he is quite mistaken, as are all exoteric profane translators. TheAvesta has not borrowed the idea from the Rig-Veda, but simply repeats the esoteric teaching. The \"three strata orlayers\" do not refer to our globe alone, but to three layers of the globes of our terrestrial chain -- two by two, on eachplane, one on the descending, the other on the ascending arc. Thus, with reference to the six spheres or globes aboveour earth, the seventh and the fourth, it is septempartite, while with regard to the planes over our plane -- it is tripartite.This meaning is carried out and corroborated by the text in the Avesta and Vendidad, and even by the speculations -- amost laborious and unsatisfactory guess-work -- of the translators and commentators. It thus follows that the division ofthe \"earth,\" or rather the earth's chain, into seven Karshvars is not in contradiction with the three \"zones,\" if this word isread \"planes.\" As Geiger remarks, this septenary division is very old -- the oldest of all -- since the Gathas already speakof the \"septempartite earth.\" (Bumi haptaiti, Yasna, xxxii., 3.) For, \"according to the Parsee Scriptures, the sevenKarshvars are to be considered as completely disconnected parts of the earth,\" which they surely are. For, \"betweenthem there flows the Ocean, so that it is impossible, as stated in several passages, to pass from one Karshvar toanother.\"** The \"Ocean\" is space, of course, for the latter was called \"Waters of Space\" before it was known as Ether.Moreover, the word Karshvar is consistently rendered by Dwipa, and especially Qaniratha by Jambudwipa (\"Neriosengh,the translator of the Yasna.\")*** But this fact is not taken into account by the Orientalists, and therefore we find even sucha learned Zoroastrian and Parsi by birth as the translator of Dr. Geiger's work passing unnoticed and without a word ofcomment sundry remarks of the former on the \"incongruities\" of this kind abounding in the Mazdean Scriptures. One ofsuch \"incongruities\" and \"coincidences\" concerns the similarity of the Zoroastrian with the Indian tenet with regard to theseven Dwipas (islands, or continents, rather) as met with in the Puranas, namely: \"The Dwipas form concentric rings,which, separated by the ocean, surround Jambu Dvipa, which is situated in the centre\" (p. 130, vol. I.), and, \"according tothe Iranian view, the Karshvar Qaniratha is likewise situated in the centre of the rest . . . . each of them (the other sixKarshvars) is a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* p. 129, \"Civilization of the Eastern Iranians in Ancient Times.\"** Cf., e.g., Vol. I., 4, of the Pahlavi Translation; Bdh. xxi., 2-3.*** Footnote by Darab Dastur Peshotan Sanjana, B.A., the translator of Dr. Wilhelm Geiger's work on the \"Civilization ofthe Eastern Iranians.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 759 THE MAZDEAN VIEW OF THE SEVEN EARTHS.peculiar individual space, and so they group themselves round (above) Qaniratha\" (Ibid. p. 131). Now Qaniratha is not, asbelieved by Geiger and his translator, \"the country inhabited by the Iranian tribes,\" and the other names do not mean \"theadjacent territories of foreign nations in the North, South, West, and East\" (p. 132), but our globe or Earth. For that whichis meant by the sentence which follows the last quoted, namely, that \"two Vorubarshti and Voru-Zarshti lie in the North;two, Vidadhafshu and Tradadhafshu, in the South; Savahi and Arzahi in the East and West,\" is simply the very graphicand accurate description of the \"chain\" of our planet, the Earth, represented in the book of Dzyan (11) thus:[[diagram]][[text of diagram]]N(North) (North)(West) Arzahi W E Savahi (East)(South) Tradadhafshu S Vidadhafshu (South)Qaniratha.The Mazdean names given above have only to be replaced by those used in the Secret Doctrine to become an orthodoxtenet. The \"Earth\" (our World), therefore, is \"tripartite,\" because the chain of the worlds is situated on three differentplanes above our globe; and it is septempartite because of the seven globes or spheres which compose the chain. Hencethe further meaning given in Vendidad XIX. 39, showing that \"Qaniratha alone is combined with imat, 'this' (earth), whileall other Karshvares are combined with the word 'avat,' 'that' or those -- upper earths.\" Nothing could be plainer.The same may be said of the modern comprehension of all other ancient beliefs.The Druids understood the meaning of the Sun in Taurus, therefore, when, while all the fires were extinguished on the 1stof November, their sacred and inextinguishable fires alone remained to illumine the horizon, like those of the Magi andthe modern Zoroastrians. And like the early Fifth Race and later Chaldees, the Greeks, and again like the Christians, whodo the same to this day, without suspecting the real meaning, they greeted the Morning Star -- the beautiful Venus-Lucifer.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Dr. Kenealy quotes, in his \"Book of God,\" Vallancey, who says \"I had not been a week landed in Ireland from Gibraltar,where I had studied Hebrew and Chaldaic under Jews of various countries, when I heard a peasant girl say to boorstanding by her \"Teach an Maddin Nag\" (Behold the morning star), pointing to the planet Venus, the Maddena Nag of theChaldeans.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 760 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Strabo speaks of an island near to Britannia, \"where Ceres and Persephone were worshipped with the same rites as inSamothrace (lib. iv.) and this island was Sacred Ierna,\" where a perpetual fire was lit. The Druids believed in the rebirth ofman, not as Lucian explains: \"that the same spirit shall animate a new body, not here, but in a different world,\" but in aseries of re-incarnations in this same world; for as Diodorus says, they declared that the souls of men, after determinateperiods, would pass into other bodies.*These tenets came to the Fifth Race Aryans from their predecessors of the Fourth Race, the Atlanteans. They hadpiously preserved the teachings, which told them how their parent Root-Race, becoming with every generation morearrogant, owing to the acquisition of superhuman powers, had been gradually gliding toward its end. Those recordsreminded them of the giant intellect of the preceding races as well as of their giant size. One finds the repetition of thoserecords in every age of history, in almost every old fragment which has descended to us from antiquity.AElian preserved an extract from Theophrastus written during the days of Alexander the Great. It is a dialogue betweenMidas, the Phrygian, and Silenus. The former is told of a continent that had existed in times of old, so immense, that Asia,Europe and Africa seemed like poor islands compared with it. It was the last to produce animals and plants of giganticmagnitudes. There, said Silenus, men grew to double the size of the tallest man in his (the narrator's) time, and they livedto twice as old an age. They had wealthy cities with temples, and one of such (cities) held more than a million ofinhabitants in it, gold and silver being found there in great abundance. . . .Grote's suggestion that Atlantis was but a myth arisen from a mirage -- clouds on a dazzling sky taking the appearance ofislands on a golden sea -- is too disingenuous to be even noticed.A.SOME STATEMENTS ABOUT THE SACRED ISLANDS AND CONTINENTS IN THE CLASSICS, EXPLAINEDESOTERICALLY.All that which precedes was known to Plato, and to many others. But as no Initiate had the right to divulge and declare allhe knew, posterity got only hints. Aiming more to instruct as a moralist than as a geographer and ethnologist or historian,the Greek philosopher merged the history of Atlantis, which covered several million years, into one[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* There was a time when the whole world, the totality of mankind, had one religion, and when they were of \"one lip.\" \"Allthe religions of the Earth were at first One and emanated from one centre,\" says Faber very truly.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 761 WHO, OR WHAT WILL BE DENIED NEXT?event which he located on one comparatively small island 3000 stadia long by 2000 wide; (or about 350 miles by 200,which is about the size of Ireland), whereas the priests spoke of Atlantis as a continent vast as \"all Asia and Lybia\" puttogether. But, however altered in its general aspect, Plato's narrative bears the impress of truth upon it.* It was not hewho invented it, at any rate, since Homer, who preceded him by many centuries, also speaks of the Atlantes (who are ourAtlanteans) and of their island in his Odyssey. Therefore the tradition was older than the bard of Ulysses. The Atlantesand the Atlantides of mythology are based upon the Atlantes and the Atlantides of history. Both Sanchoniathon andDiodorus have preserved the histories of those heroes and heroines, however much these accounts may have becomemixed up with the mythical element.In our own day we witness the stupendous fact that such comparatively recent personages as Shakespeare and WilliamTell are all but denied, an attempt being made to show one to be a nom de plume, and the other a person who neverexisted. What wonder then, that the two powerful races -- the Lemurians and the Atlanteans -- have been merged intoand identified, in time, with a few half mythical peoples, who all bore the same patronymic?Herodotus speaks of the Atlantes -- a people of Western Africa which gave its name to Mount Atlas; who werevegetarians, and \"whose sleep was never disturbed by dreams\"; and who, moreover, \"daily cursed the sun at his risingand at his setting because his excessive heat scorched and tormented them.\"These statements are based upon moral and psychic facts and not on physiological disturbance. The story of Atlas (Videsupra) gives the key to it. If the Atlanteans never had their sleep disturbed by dreams, it is because that particulartradition is concerned with the earliest Atlanteans, whose physical frame and brain were not yet sufficiently consolidated,in the physiological sense, to permit the nervous centres to act during sleep. With regard to that other statement --namely, that[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Plato's veracity has been so unwarrantably impeached by even such friendly critics as Professor Jowett, when the \"storyof Atlantis\" is discussed, that it seems well to cite the testimony of a specialist on the subject. It is sufficient to place mereliterary cavillers in a very ridiculous position:--\"If our knowledge of Atlantis was more thorough, it would no doubt appear that in every instance wherein the people ofEurope accord with the people of America, they were both in accord with the people of Atlantis. . . . . It will be seen that inevery case where Plato gives us information in this respect as to Atlantis, we find this agreement to exist. It existed inarchitecture, sculpture, navigation, engraving, writing, an established priesthood, the mode of worship, agriculture, andthe construction of roads and canals; and it is reasonable to suppose that the same correspondence extended down to allthe minor details.\" (Donnelly, \"Atlantis,\" p. 194.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 762 THE SECRET DOCTRINE."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"they daily \"cursed the Sun\" -- this again has nothing to do with the heat, but with the moral degeneration that grew withthe race. It is explained in our Commentaries. \"They (the sixth sub-race of the Atlanteans) used magic incantations evenagainst the Sun\" -- failing in which, they cursed it. The sorcerers of Thessaly were credited with the power of calling downthe moon, as Greek history assures us. The Atlanteans of the later period were renowned for their magic powers andwickedness, their ambition and defiance of the gods. Thence the same traditions taking form in the Bible about theantediluvian giants and the Tower of Babel, found also in the \"Book of Enoch.\"Diodorus records another fact or two: the Atlanteans boasted of possessing the land in which all the gods had receivedtheir birth; as also of having had Uranus for their first King, he being also the first to teach them astronomy. Very littlemore than this has come down to us from Antiquity.The myth of Atlas is an allegory easily understood. Atlas is the old continents of Lemuria and Atlantis, combined andpersonified in one symbol. The poets attribute to Atlas, as to Proteus, a superior wisdom and an universal knowledge,and especially a thorough acquaintance with the depths of the ocean: because both continents bore races instructed bydivine masters, and because both were transferred to the bottom of the seas, where they now slumber until their nextreappearance above the waters. Atlas is the son of an ocean nymph, and his daughter is Calypso -- \"the watery deep,\"(See Hesiod's Theogony, 507-509, and Odyssey 1, 51): Atlantis has been submerged beneath the waters of the ocean,and its progeny is now sleeping its eternal sleep on the ocean floors. The Odyssey makes of him the guardian and the\"sustainer\" of the huge pillars that separate the heavens from the earth (1, 52-53). He is their \"supporter.\" And as bothLemuria, destroyed by submarine fires, and Atlantis, submerged by the waves, perished in the ocean deeps,* Atlas issaid to have been compelled to leave the surface of the earth, and join his brother Iapetos in the depths of Tartarus. SirTheodore Martin is right in interpreting this allegory as meaning, Atlas \"standing on the solid floor of the inferiorhemisphere of the universe and thus carrying at the same time the disc of the earth and the celestial vault -- the solidenvelope of the superior hemisphere\" . . . (Memoires de l'Academie des[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Christians ought not to object to this doctrine of the periodical destruction of continents by fire and water; for St. Peterspeaks of the earth \"standing out of the water, and in the water, which earth, being overflowed, perished, but is nowreserved unto fire\"; (See also the \"Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers,\" p. 4, London, 1815).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]]763 THE HEIRLOOM OF ATLANTIS.Inscriptions, p. 176). For Atlas is Atlantis which supports the new continents and their horizons on its \"shoulders.\"Decharme, in his Mythologie de la Grece Antique, expresses a doubt as to the correctness of Pierron's translation of theHomeric word [[echei]] by sustinet, as it is not possible to see \"how Atlas can support or bear at once several pillarssituated in various localities.\" If Atlas were an individual it would be an awkward translation. But, as he personifies acontinent in the west said to support heaven and earth at once (AEschylus, \"Prometheus Vinctus,\" 351, 429, etc.) -- i.e.,the feet of the giant tread the earth while his shoulders support the celestial vault, an allusion to the gigantic peaks of theLemurian and Atlantean continents -- the epithet \"supporter\" becomes very correct. The term \"conservator\" for the Greekword [[echei]], which Decharme, following Sir Theodore Martin, understands as meaning [[phulassei]] and [[epimeleitai]],does not render the same sense.The conception was certainly due to the gigantic mountain chain running along the terrestrial border (or disc). Thesemountain peaks plunged their roots into the very bottom of the seas, while they raised their heads heavenward, theirsummits being lost in the clouds. The ancient continents had more mountains than valleys on them. Atlas, and theTeneriffe Peak, now two of the dwarfed relics of the two lost continents, were thrice as lofty during the day of Lemuria andtwice as high in that of Atlantis. Thus, the Lybians called Mount Atlas \"the pillar of Heaven,\" according to Herodotus (IV.,184), and Pindar qualified the later AEtna as \"the celestial pillar\" (Pyth. 1, 20; Decharme, 315). Atlas was an inaccessibleisland peak in the days of Lemuria, when the African continent had not yet been raised. It is the sole Western relic whichsurvives, independent, of the continent on which the Third Race was born, developed and fell,* for Australia is now part ofthe Eastern continent. Proud Atlas, according to esoteric tradition, having sunk one third of its size into the waters, its twoparts remained as an heirloom of Atlantis.This again was known to the priests of Egypt and to Plato himself, the solemn oath of secrecy, which extended even tothe mysteries of Neo-Platonism, alone preventing the whole truth from being told.** So[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* This does not mean that Atlas is the locality where it fell, for this took place in Northern and Central Asia; but that Atlasformed part of the continent.** Had not Diocletian burned the esoteric works of the Egyptians in 296, together with their books on alchemy -- \"[[perichumeias kai chrusou]]\"; Caesar 700,000 rolls at Alexandria, and Leo Isaurus 300,000 at Constantinople (viiith cent.); andthe Mahomedans all they could lay their sacrilegious hands on -- the world might know to-day more of Atlantis than itdoes.

Theopompus says as much in his ever-suspected Meropis, when he speaks of thePhoenicians as being the only navigators in the seas which wash the Western coast of Africa; and who did it with suchmystery that very often they sunk their own vessels to make the too inquisitive foreigners lose all trace of them."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"There are those Orientalists and historians -- and they form the majority -- who, while feeling quite unmoved at the rathercrude language of the Bible, and some of the events narrated in it, show great disgust at the immorality in the pantheonsof India and Greece.* We may be told that before them Euripides, Pindar, and even Plato, express the same; that theytoo felt irritated with the tales invented --\"those miserable stories of the poets,\" as Euripides expresses it ([[haoidon hoidedustenoi logoi]], Hercules furens, 1346, Dindorf's Edition).But there may have been another reason for this, perhaps. To those who knew that there was more than one key totheogonic symbolism, it was a mistake to have expressed it in a language so crude and misleading. For if the educatedand learned philosopher could discern the kernel of wisdom under the coarse rind of the fruit, and knew that the latterconcealed the greatest laws and truths of psychic and physical nature, as well as the origin of all things -- not so with theuninitiated profane.

But[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Professor Max Muller's Lectures -- \"on the Philosophy of Mythology\" -- are before us. We read his citations ofHerakleitos (460 B.C.), declaring that Homer deserved \"to be ejected from public assemblies and flogged;\" and ofXenophanes \"holding Homer and Hesiod responsible for the popular superstitions of Greece. . . . \" and for ascribing \"tothe gods whatever is disgraceful and scandalous among men . . . unlawful acts, such as theft, adultery, and fraud.\" Finallythe Oxford Professor quotes from Professor Jowett's translation of Plato, where the latter tells Adaimantos (Republic) that\"the young man (in the State) should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes, he is far from doing anythingoutrageous, and that he may chastise his father (as Zeus did with Kronos) . . in any manner that he likes, and in this willonly be following the example of the first and greatest of the gods. . . In my opinion, these stories are not fit to berepeated.\" To this Dr. Max Muller observes that \"the Greek religion was clearly a national and traditional religion, and, assuch, it shared both the advantages and disadvantages of this form of religious belief\"; while the Christian religion is \"anhistorical and, to a great extent, an individual religion, and it possesses the advantage of an authorised codex and of asettled system of faith\" (p. 349). So much the worse if it is \"historical,\" for surely Lot's incident with his daughters wouldonly gain, were it \"allegorical.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 765 THE GOD-BEARING LAND.to the philosopher -- especially the Initiate -- Hesiod's theogony is as historical as any history can be. Plato accepts it assuch, and gives out as much of its truths as his pledges permitted him.The fact that the Atlantes claimed Uranos for their first king, and that Plato commences his story of Atlantis by the divisionof the great continent by Neptune, the grandson of Uranos, shows that there were continents and kings before Atlantis.For Neptune, to whose lot that continent fell, finds on a small island only one human couple made of clay (i.e., the firstphysical human man, whose origin began with the last sub-races of the Third Root-Race). It is their daughter Clito that thegod marries, and it is his eldest son Atlas who receives for his part the mountain and the continent which was called byhis name.Now all the gods of Olympus, as well as those of the Hindu Pantheon and the Rishis, were the septiform personations (1)of the noumena of the intelligent Powers of nature; (2) of Cosmic Forces; (3) of celestial bodies; (4) of gods or DhyanChohans; (5) of psychic and spiritual powers; (6) of divine kings on earth (or the incarnations of the gods); and (7) ofterrestrial heroes or men. The knowledge how to discern among these seven forms the one that is meant, belonged at alltimes to the Initiates, whose earliest predecessors had created this symbolical and allegorical system.Thus while Uranos (or the host representing this celestial group) reigned and ruled over the Second Race and their (then)Continent; Kronos or Saturn governed the Lemurians; and Jupiter, Neptune* and others fought in the allegory for Atlantis,which was the whole earth in the day of the Fourth Race. Poseidonis, or the (last) island of Atlantis \"the third step ofIdaspati\" (or Vishnu) in the mystic language of the secret books -- lasted till about 12,000 years ago.** The Atlantes ofDiodorus were right in claiming that it was their country, the region surrounding Mount Atlas, where \"the gods were born\" -- i.e., \"incarnated.\" But it was after their fourth incarnation that they became, for the first time, human Kings and rulers.Diodorus speaks of Uranos as the first king of Atlantis, confusing, either consciously or otherwise, the continents; but, asshown, Plato indirectly corrects the statement. The first astronomical teacher of men was Uranos, because he is one ofthe seven Dhyan Chohans of that second period or Race. Thus also in the second Manvantara[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Neptune or Poseidon is the Hindu Idaspati, identical with Narayana (the mover on the waters) or Vishnu, and like thisHindu god he is shown crossing the whole horizon in three steps.

And thus also the Chinese revere Tien (or the sky,Ouranos), and name him as their first teacher of astronomy. Uranos gave birth to the Titans of the Third Race, and it isthey who (personified by Saturn-Kronos) mutilated him. For as it is the Titans who fell into generation, when \"creation bywill was superseded by physical procreation,\" they needed Uranos no more."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"And here a short digression must be permitted and pardoned. In consequence of the last scholarly production of Mr.Gladstone in the Nineteenth Century, \"The Greater Gods of Olympos,\" the ideas of the general public about GreekMythology have been still further perverted and biassed. Homer is credited with an inner thought, which is regarded byMr. Gladstone as \"the true key to the Homeric conception,\" whereas this \"key\" was merely a blind. Poseidon \"is indeedessentially of the earth earthy . . . . strong and self-asserting, sensual and intensely jealous and vindictive,\" -- but this isbecause he symbolises the Spirit of the Fourth Root-Race, the ruler of the Seas, that race which lives above the surfaceof the seas ([[limne]], Il. xxiv., 79), which is composed of the giants, the children of Eurymedon, the race which is thefather of Polyphemus, the Titan and one-eyed Cyclops. Though Zeus reigns over the Fourth Race, it is Poseidon whorules, and who is the true key to the triad of the Kronid Brothers and to our human races. Poseidon and Nereus are one:the former the ruler or spirit of Atlantis before the beginning of its submersion, the latter, after. Neptune is the titanicstrength of the living race; Nereus, its spirit reincarnated in the subsequent Fifth or Aryan Race: and this is what the greatGreek scholar of England has not yet discovered, or even dimly perceived. And yet he makes many observations uponthe \"artfulness\" of Homer, who never names Nereus, at whose designation we arrive . . . . only through the patronymic ofthe Nereids!Thus the tendency of even the most erudite Hellenists is to confine their speculations to the exoteric images of mythologyand to lose sight of their inner meaning: and it is remarkably illustrated in the case of the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, aswe have shown. While almost the most conspicuous figure of our age as a statesman, he is at the same time one of themost cultured scholars England has given birth to. Grecian literature has been the loving study of his life, and he hasfound time amid the bustle of public affairs to enrich contemporary literature with contributions to Greek scholarship whichwill make his name famous through coming generations.

In that future day it will be perceived that the esoteric key to the mysteries of the Christian as well as of theGrecian theogonies and Sciences, is the Secret Doctrine of the pre-historic nations, which, along with others, he hasdenied. It is that Doctrine alone which can trace the kinship of all human religious speculations or even so-calledRevelations, and it is this teaching which infuses the Spirit of life into the lay figures on the Mounts of Meru, Olympus,Walhalla, or Sinai. If Mr. Gladstone were a younger man, his admirers might hope that his scholastic studies would becrowned by the discovery of this underlying truth. As it is, he but wastes the golden hours of his declining years in futiledisputations with that giant free-thinker, Col. Ingersoll, each fighting with the weapons of exoteric temper, drawn from thearsenals of ignorant LITERALISM. These two great controversialists are equally blind to the true esoteric meaning of thetexts which they hurl at each other's head like iron bullets, while the world alone suffers by such controversies: since theone helps to strengthen the ranks of materialism, and the other those of blind Sectarianism and of the dead letter. Andnow we may return once more to our immediate subject.Many a time Atlantis is spoken of under another name, one unknown to our commentators. The power of names is great,and was known since the first men were instructed by the divine masters. And as Solon had studied it, he translated the\"Atlantean\" names into names devised by himself. In connection with the continent of Atlantis, it is desirable to bear inmind that the accounts which have come down to us from the old Greek writers contain a confusion of statements, somereferring to the Great Continent and others to the last small island of Poseidonis. It has become customary to take themall as referring to the latter only, but that this is incorrect is evident from the incompatibility of the various statements as tothe size, etc., of \"Atlantis.\"Thus, in the Timaeus and Critias, Plato says, that the plain surrounding the city was itself surrounded by mountain chains.. . . . And the plain was smooth and level, and of an oblong shape, lying north and south, three thousand stadia in onedirection and two thousand in the other. . . . . They surrounded the plain by an enormous canal or dike, 101 feet deep,606 feet broad, and 1,250 miles in length.Now in other places the entire size of the island of Poseidonis is given as about the same as that assigned here to the\"plain around the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 768 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.city\" alone. Obviously, one set of statements refers to the great continent, and the other to its last remnant -- Plato'sisland.And, again, the standing army of Atlantis is given as upwards of a million men; its navy as 1,200 ships and 240,000 men.Such statements are quite inapplicable to a small island state, of about the size of Ireland!The Greek allegories give to Atlas, or Atlantis, seven daughters (seven sub-races), whose respective names are Maia,Electra, Taygeta, Asterope, Merope, Alcyone, and Celaeno. This ethnologically, as they are credited with having marriedgods and with having become the mothers of famous heroes, the founders of many nations and cities. Astronomically, theAtlantides have become the seven Pleiades (?). In occult science the two are connected with the destinies of nations,those destinies being shaped by the past events of their early lives according to Karmic law.Three great nations claimed in antiquity a direct descent from the kingdom of Saturn or Lemuria (confused alreadyseveral thousands of years before our era with Atlantis): and these were the Egyptians, the Phoenicians (VideSanchoniathon), and the old Greeks (Vide Diodorus, after Plato). But the oldest civilized country of Asia -- India -- can be"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"shown to claim the same descent likewise. Sub-races guided by Karmic law or destiny repeat unconsciously the firststeps of their respective mother-races. As the comparatively fair Brahmins have come -- when invading India with itsdark-coloured Dravidians -- from the North, so the Aryan Fifth Race must claim its origin from northern regions. The occultsciences show that the founders (the respective groups of the seven Prajapatis) of the Root Races have all beenconnected with the Pole Star. In the Commentary we find:--\"He who understands the age of Dhruva* who measures 9090 mortal years, will understand the times of the pralayas, thefinal destiny of nations, O Lanoo.\"Moreover there must have been a good reason why an Asiatic nation should locate its great progenitors and saints in theUrsa Major, a northern constellation. It is 70,000 YEARS, HOWEVER, SINCE THE POLE OF THE EARTH POINTED TOTHE FURTHER END OF URSA MINOR'S TAIL; and many more thousand years since the seven Rishis could have beenidentified with the constellation of Ursa Major.The Aryan race was born and developed in the far north, though after the sinking of the continent of Atlantis its tribesemigrated further south into Asia. Hence Prometheus is son of Asia, and Deukalion, his son, the Greek Noah -- he whocreated men out of the stones of mother[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The equivalent of this name is given in the original.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 769 THE SONS OF COELUS AND TERRA.earth -- is called a northern Scythe, by Lucian, and Prometheus is made the brother of Atlas and is tied down to MountCaucasus amid the Snows.*Greece had her Hyperborean as well as her Southern Apollo. Thus nearly all the gods of Egypt, Greece, and Phoenicia,as well as those of other Pantheons, are of a northern origin and originated in Lemuria, towards the close of the ThirdRace, after its full physical and physiological evolution had been completed.** All the \"fables\" of Greece were built onhistorical facts, if that history had only passed unadulterated by myths to posterity. The \"one-eyed\" Cyclopes, the giantsfabled as the sons of Coelus and Terra -- three in number, according to Hesiod -- were the last three sub-races of theLemurians, the \"one-eye\" referring to the Wisdom eye***; for the two front eyes were fully developed as physical organsonly in the beginning of the Fourth Race. The allegory of Ulysses, whose companions were devoured while the king ofIthaca was saved by putting out with a fire-brand the eye of Polyphemus, is based upon the psycho-physiological atrophyof the \"third\" eye. Ulysses belongs to the cycle of the heroes of the Fourth Race, and, though a \"sage\" in the sight of thelatter, must have been a profligate in the opinion of the pastoral Cyclopes.**** His adventure with the latter -- a savagegigantic race, the antithesis of cultured civilization in the Odyssey -- is an allegorical record of the gradual passage fromthe Cyclopean civilization of stone and colossal buildings to the more sensual and physical culture of the Atlanteans,which finally caused the last of[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Deukalion is said to have brought the worship of Adonis and Osiris into Phoenicia. Now the worship is that of the Sun,lost and found again in its astronomical significance. It is only at the Pole where the Sun dies out for such a length of timeas six months, for in latitude 68 [[degrees]] it remains dead only for forty days, as in the festival of Osiris. The twoworships were born in the north of Lemuria, or on that continent of which Asia was a kind of broken prolongation, andwhich stretched up to the Polar regions. This is well shown by de Gebelin's \"Allegories d'Orient,\" p. 246, and by Bailly;though neither Hercules nor Osiris are solar myths, save in one of their seven aspects.** The Hyperboreans, now regarded as mythical, were described (Herod, IV., 33-35; Pausanias, 1, 31, 2; V., 7, 8; ad X.,5, 7, 8) as the beloved priests and servants of the gods, and of Apollo chiefly.*** The Cyclopes are not the only \"one-eyed\" representatives in tradition. The Arimaspes were a Scythian people, andwere also credited with but one eye. (Geographie ancienne, Vol. II, p. 321.) It is they whom Apollo destroyed with hisshafts. (See supra.)**** Ulysses was wrecked on the isle of AEaea, where Circe changed all his companions into pigs for theirvoluptuousness; and after that he was thrown into Ogygia, the island of Calypso, where for some seven years he livedwith the nymph in illicit connection (Odyssey and elsewhere). Now Calypso was a daughter of Atlas (Odys. Book XII.),and all the traditional ancient versions, when speaking of the Isle of Ogygia, say that it was very distant from Greece, andright in the middle of the ocean: thus identifying it with Atlantis.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 770 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.the Third Race to lose their all-penetrating spiritual eye. That other allegory, which makes Apollo kill the Cyclops toavenge the death of his son Asclepios, does not refer to the three races represented by the three sons of Heaven andEarth, but to the Hyperborean Arimaspian Cyclopes, the last of the race endowed with the \"Wisdom-eye.\" The formerhave left relics of their buildings everywhere, in the south as much as in the north; the latter, were confined to the northsolely. Thus Apollo -- pre-eminently the god of the Seers, whose duty it is to punish desecration -- killed them -- his shaftsrepresenting human passions, fiery and lethal -- and hid his shaft behind a mountain in the Hyperborean regions. (Hygin.\"Astron. Poetique,\" Book ii. c. 15). Cosmically and astronomically this Hyperborean god is the Sun personified, whichduring the course of the sidereal year (25,868 y.) changes the climates on the earth's surface, making of tropical, frigidregions, and vice versa. Psychically and spiritually his significance is far more important. As Mr. Gladstone pertinentlyremarks in his \"Greater Gods of Olympos,\" \"the qualities of Apollo (jointly with Athene) are impossible to be accounted for"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"without repairing to sources, which lie beyond the limit of the traditions most commonly explored for the elucidation of theGreek mythology\" (Nineteenth Century, July, 1887.)The history of Latona (Leto), Apollo's mother, is most pregnant in various meanings. Astronomically, Latona is the polarregion and the night, giving birth to the Sun, Apollo, Phoebus, etc. She is born in the Hyperborean countries wherein allthe inhabitants were priests of her son, celebrating his resurrection and descent to their country every nineteen years atthe renewal of the lunar cycle (Diod. Sic. II. 307). Latona is the Hyperborean Continent, and its race -- geologically.*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* To make a difference between Lemuria and Atlantis, the ancient writers referred to the latter as the northern orHyperborean Atlantis, and to the former as the southern. Thus Apollodorus says (Mythology, Book II.): \"The goldenapples carried away by Hercules are not, as some think, in Lybia; they are in the Hyperborean Atlantis.\" The Greeksnaturalised all the gods they borrowed and made Hellenes of them, and the moderns helped them. Thus also themythologists have tried to make of Eridan the river Po, in Italy. In the myth of Phaeton it is said that at his death hissisters dropped hot tears which fell into Eridan and were changed into amber! Now amber is found only in the northernseas, in the Baltic. Phaeton, meeting with his death while carrying heat to the frozen stars of the boreal regions,awakening at the Pole the Dragon made rigid by cold, and being hurled down into the Eridan, is an allegory referringdirectly to the changes of climate in those distant times when, from a frigid zone, the polar lands had become a countrywith a moderate and warm climate. The usurper of the functions of the sun, Phaeton, being hurled into the Eridan byJupiter's thunderbolt, is an allusion to the second change that took place in those regions when, once more, the landwhere \"the magnolia blossomed\" became the desolate forbidding land of the farthest north and eternal ices. This allegorycovers then the events of two pralayas; and if well understood ought to be a demonstration of the enormous antiquity ofthe human races.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 771 THE CHILDREN OF NIOBE.When the astronomical meaning cedes its place to the spiritual and divine -- Apollo and Athene transforming themselvesinto the form of birds, the symbol and glyph of the higher divinities and angels -- then the bright god assumes divinecreative powers. Apollo becomes the personification of Seership, when he sends the astral double of AEneas to the battlefield (II. 431-53), and has the gift of appearing to his Seers without being visible to other persons present -- (Iliad, xvii.,322-36) -- a gift, however, shared by every high Adept.The King of the Hyperboreans, was, therefore, the son of Boreas, the north-wind, and the High Priest of Apollo. Thequarrel of Latona with Niobe (the Atlantean race) -- the mother of seven sons and seven daughters personifying theseven sub-races of the Fourth Race and their seven branches (see Apollodorus for this number) -- allegorizes the historyof the two continents. The wrath of \"the sons of god,\" or of \"Will and Yoga,\" at seeing the steady degradation of theAtlanteans was great (See \"The Sons of God and the Sacred Island\"); and the destruction of the \"children of Niobe\" bythe children of Latona -- Apollo and Diana, the deities of light, wisdom and purity, or the Sun and Moon astronomically,whose influence causes changes in the earth's axis, deluges and other cosmic cataclysms -- is thus very clear.* The fableabout the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* So occult and mystic is one of the aspects of Latona that she is made to reappear even in Revelation (xii.) as thewoman clothed with the Sun (Apollo) and the Moon (Diana) under her feet, who being with child \"cries, travailing in birth,pained to be delivered.\" A great red Dragon, etc., stands before the woman ready to devour the child. She brings forth theman child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, and who was caught unto the throne of God (the Sun). Thewoman fled to the wilderness still pursued by the Dragon, who flees again, and casts out of his mouth water as a flood,when the earth helped the woman and swallowed the flood; and the Dragon went to make war with the remnant of herseed who keep the commandment of God, etc. (See xii., 1, 17.) Anyone, who reads the allegory of Latona pursued by therevenge of jealous Juno, will recognise the identity of the two versions. Juno sends Python, the Dragon, to persecute anddestroy Latona and devour her babe. The latter is Apollo, the Sun, for \"the man-child, who was to rule all nations with arod of iron\" of Revelation, is surely not the meek \"Son of God,\" Jesus, but the physical Sun, \"who rules all nations\"; theDragon being the North Pole, gradually chasing the early Lemurians from the lands which became more and moreHyperborean and unfit to be inhabited by those who were fast developing into physical men, for they now had to deal withthe climatic variations. The Dragon will not allow Latona \"to bring forth\" -- (the Sun to appear). \"She is driven fromheaven, and finds no place where she can bring forth,\" until Neptune (the ocean), moved with pity, makes immovable thefloating isle of Delos (the nymph Asteria, hitherto hiding from Jupiter under the waves of the ocean) on which Latona findsrefuge and where the bright god [[Delios]] is born, the god, who no sooner appears than he kills Python, the cold and frostof the Arctic region, in whose deadly coils all life becomes extinct. In other words, Latona-Lemuria is transformed intoNiobe-Atlantis, over which her son Apollo, or the Sun, reigns -- with an iron rod, truly, since Herodotus makes the Atlantescurse his too great heat.

Niobe, let it be remembered, is the daughter of one of the Pleiades (or Atlantides) the grand-daughter of Atlas therefore, (See \"Metamorphoses of Ovid,\" Book VI.), because she represents the last generations of thedoomed continent.A true remark, that of Bailly, which says that Atlantis had an enormous influence on antiquity. \"If these names,\" he adds,\"are mere allegories, then all that those fables contain of truth comes from Atlantis; if the fable is a real tradition --however altered -- then the whole of the ancient history is still in it.\" (Lettres sur l'Atlantide, p. 137.)"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"So much so, that all ancient writings -- prose and poetry -- are full of the reminiscences of the Lemuro-Atlanteans, the firstphysical races, though the Third and the Fourth in number.

Clad in bronze from head tofoot they passed their lives in fighting.

The said verse addresses Zoroaster as one of the \"Sons of God.\" -- It says: \"Thou, O Zarathustra, didstmake all demons (i.e., Sorcerers), who before roamed the world in human forms, conceal themselves in the earth\" (i.e.,helped them to get submerged).The Lemurians, as also the early Atlanteans, were divided into two distinct classes -- the \"Sons of Night\" or Darkness,and the \"Sons of the Sun,\" or Light. The old books tell us of terrible battles between the two, when the former, leavingtheir land of Darkness, from whence the Sun departed for long months, descended from their inhospitable regions and\"tried to wrench the lord of light\" from their better favoured brothers of the equatorial regions. We may be told that theancients knew nothing of the long night of six months' duration in the Polar regions.

Yet theGreeks knew well that there was a country in the north where the year was divided into a day and night of six months'duration each, for Pliny says so in his Fourth Book, c. 12. They speak of the Cimmerians and of the Hyperboreans, anddraw a distinction between the two. The former inhabited the Palus Maeotis (between 45 [[degrees]] and 50 [[degrees]]latitude). Plutarch explains that they were but a small portion of a great nation driven away by the Scythians, which nationstopped near Tanais, having crossed Asia. \"These warlike multitudes lived formerly on the ocean shores, in denseforests, and under a tenebrous sky. There the pole is almost touching the head, there long nights and days divide theyear\" (in Mario). As to the Hyperboreans, these peoples, as expressed by Solinus Polyhistor (c. 16), \"sow in the morning,reap at noon, gather their fruits in the evening, and store them during the night in their caves.\"Even the writers of the Zohar knew of the fact (as shown in iii., fol. 10a), as it is written: \"In the Book of Hammannunah,the Old, we learn . . . . there are some countries of the earth which are lightened, whilst others are in darkness; thesehave the day, when for the former it is night; and there are countries in which it is constantly day, or in which at least thenight continues only some instants.\" (Isaac Myer's \"Qabbalah,\" p. 139).The island of Delos, the Asteria of the Greek mythology, was never in Greece, a country which, in its day, was not yet inexistence, not even in its molecular form. Several writers have shown that it represented a country or an island, far largerthan the small dots of land which became Greece. Both Pliny and Diodorus Siculus place it in the Northern seas. Onecalls it Basilea or \"royal\" (Vol. II., p. 225 of Diod.); the other, Pliny, names it Osericta (Book xxxvii, c. 2), a word, accordingto Rudbeck (Vol. I., p. 462-464), having had \"a significance in the northern languages, equivalent to the Island of thedivine Kings or god-Kings,\" or again the \"royal island of the gods,\" because the gods were born there, i.e., the divinedynasties of the kings of Atlantis proceeded from that place. Let geographers and geologists seek for it among that groupof islands discovered by Nordenskiold on his Vega voyage in the arctic regions.* The secret books inform us that theclimate has changed in those regions more than once since the first men inhabited those now almost inaccessiblelatitudes. They were a paradise before they became hell;[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* These islands were \"found strewn with fossils of horses, sheep, oxen, etc., among gigantic bones of elephants,mammoths, rhinoceroses,\" etc. If there was no man on earth at that period \"how came horses and sheep to be found incompany with the huge antediluvians?\" asks a master in a letter.

The latter fact is borne out in the Iliad IV., 239-62, Vide \"The Greater gods\" --wherein Apollo is said to have appeared four times in his own form (as the god of the four races) and six times in humanform, i.e., as connected with the divine Dynasties of the earlier unseparated Lemurians.It is those early mysterious peoples, their countries (which have now become uninhabitable), as well as the name given toman both dead and alive, which have furnished an opportunity to the ignorant Church fathers for inventing a hell, whichthey have transformed into a burning instead of a freezing locality.*It is, of course, evident that it is neither the Hyperboreans, nor the Cimmerians, the Arimaspes, nor even the Scyths --known to and communicating with the Greeks -- who were our Atlanteans. But they were all the descendants of their lastsub-races.

Plato hints as much in speaking of the latter, whose name it is averred came from pelagus, the great sea. Noah'sDeluge is astronomical and allegorical, but it is not mythical, for the story is based upon the same archaic tradition of men-- or rather of nations -- which were saved during the cataclysms, in canoes, arks, and ships. No one would presume tosay that the Chaldean Xisuthrus, the Hindu Vaivasvata, the Chinese Peirun -- the \"beloved of the gods,\" who rescued himfrom the flood in a canoe -- or the Swedish Belgamer, for whom the gods did the same in the north, are all identical as apersonage. But their legends have all sprung from the catastrophe which involved both the continent and the island ofAtlantis.The allegory about the antediluvian giants and their achievements in Sorcery is no myth.

One such word is Mann, Man, a living being, and Manes, deadmen. The Laplanders call their corpses to this day manee, (Voyage de Renard en Laponie I., 184). Mannus is theancestor of the German race; the Hindu Manu, the thinking being, from man; the Egyptian Menes; and Minos, the King ofCrete, judge of the infernal regions after his death -- all proceed from the same root or word.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 775 WHO WERE THE NEPHILIM?Sinai, nor by a divine finger tracing the record on tablets of stone, but simply through tradition via pagan sources. It wasnot surely the Pentateuch that Diodorus was repeating when he wrote upon the Titans -- the giants born of Heaven andEarth, or, rather, born of the Sons of God who took to themselves for wives the daughters of men who were fair. Nor wasPherecydes quoting from Genesis when giving details on those giants which are not to be found in the Jewish Scriptures.He says that the Hyperboreans were of the race of the Titans, which race descended from the earliest giants, and that itwas that Hyperborean region which was the birth-place of the first giants. The Commentaries on the sacred books explainthat the said region was the far north, the polar lands now, the pre-Lemurian earliest continent, embracing once upon atime the present Greenland, Spitzbergen, Sweden, Norway, etc.But who were the Nephilim of Genesis vi. 4? There were Palaeolithic and Neolithic men in Palestine ages before theevents recorded in the book of the Beginnings. The theological tradition identifies these Nephilim with hairy men orSatyrs, the latter being mythical in the Fifth Race and the former historical in both the Fourth and Fifth Races. We havestated elsewhere what the prototypes of these Satyrs were, and have spoken of the bestiality of the early and laterAtlantean race. What is the meaning of Poseidon's amours under such a variety of animal forms? He became a dolphin towin Amphitrite; a horse, to seduce Ceres; a ram, to deceive Theophane, etc., etc. Poseidon is not only the personation ofthe Spirit and Race of Atlantis, but also of the vices of these giants. Gesenius and others devote an enormous space tothe meaning of the word Nephilim and explain very little. But Esoteric records show these hairy creatures to be the lastdescendants of those Lemuro-Atlantean races, which begot children on female animals, of species now long extinct; thusproducing dumb men, \"monsters,\" as the Stanzas have it.Now mythology, built upon Hesiod's Theogony, which is but a poetised record of actual traditions, or oral history, speaksof three giants, called Briareus, Kottos, and Gyges, living in a dark country where they were imprisoned by Kronos fortheir rebellion against him. All the three are endowed by myth with an hundred arms and fifty heads, the latter standing forraces, the former for sub-races and tribes. Bearing in mind that in mythology every personage almost is a god or derni-god, and also a king or simple mortal in his second aspect;* and[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Thus, for instance, Gyges is a hundred-armed and fifty-headed monster, a demi-god in one case, and a Lydian, thesuccessor of Candaules, king of the country, in another version. The same is found in the Indian Pantheon, where Rishisand the Sons of Brahma are reborn as mortals.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 776 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.that both stand as symbols for lands, islands, powers of nature, elements, nations, races and sub-races, the esotericCommentary will become comprehensible. It says that the three giants are three polar lands which have changed formseveral times, at each new cataclysm, or disappearance of one continent to make room for another. The whole globe isconvulsed periodically; and has been so convulsed, since the appearance of the First Race, four times. Yet, though thewhole face of the earth was transformed thereby each time, the conformation of the arctic and antarctic poles has but littlealtered. The polar lands unite and break off from each other into islands and peninsulas, yet remain ever the same.Therefore northern Asia is called the \"eternal or perpetual land,\" and the Antarctic the \"ever living\" and \"the concealed\";while the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Pacific and other regions disappear and reappear in turn, into and above the greatwaters.From the first appearance of the great continent of Lemuria, the three polar giants had been imprisoned in their circle byKronos. Their gaol is surrounded by a wall of bronze, and the exit is through gates fabricated by Poseidon (or Neptune,hence by the seas), which they cannot cross; and it is in that damp region, where eternal darkness reigns, that the threebrothers languish. The Iliad (viii., 13) makes of it the Tartaros. When the gods and Titans rebelled in their turn againstZeus -- the deity of the Fourth Race -- the father of the gods bethought himself of the imprisoned giants in order toconquer the gods and Titans, and to precipitate the latter into Hades; or, in clearer words, to have Lemuria hurled amidthunder and lightning to the bottom of the seas, so as to make room for Atlantis, which was to be submerged and perishin its turn.* The geological upheaval and deluge of Thessaly was a repetition on a small scale of the great cataclysm; and,remaining impressed on the memory of the Greeks, was merged by them into, and confused with, the general fate of"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Atlantis. So, also, the war between the Rakshasas of Lanka and the Bharateans, the melee of the Atlanteans and Aryansin their supreme struggle, or the conflict between the Daevas and Izeds (or Peris), became, ages later, the struggle ofTitans, separated into two inimical camps, and still later the war between the angels of God and the angels of Satan.Historical facts became theological dogmas.

For nearly two thousand years they impressed thinking Humanity with the belief inthe existence of Satan.But as it is now the conviction of more than one Greek scholar -- as it was that of Bailly and Voltaire -- that Hesiod'stheogony was based upon historical facts (see Decharme's Mythol. de la Grece Antique), it becomes easier for the occultteachings to find their way into the minds of thoughtful men, and therefore are these passages from mythology broughtforward in our discussion upon modern learning in this Addendum.Such symbolisms as are found in all the exoteric creeds, are so many landmarks of prehistoric truths. The sunny, happyland, the primitive cradle of the earliest human races, has become several times since then hyperborean and Saturnine*;thus showing the Golden Age and reign of Saturn from multiform aspects. It was many-sided in its character indeed --climatically, ethnologically and morally. For, the Third, Lemurian Race must be physiologically divided into the earlyandrogynous and the later bi-sexual race; and the climate of its dwelling places and continents into that of an eternalspring and eternal winter, into life and death, purity and impurity. The Cycle of legends is ever being transformed on itsjourney by popular fancy. Yet it may be cleansed from the dross it has picked up on its way through many nations andthrough the countless minds which have added their own exuberant additions to the original facts. Leaving for a while theGreek interpretations we may seek for some more corroborations of the latter in the scientific and geological proofs.[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Denis, the geographer, tells us that the great sea North of Asia was called glacial, or Saturnine (v. 35). Orpheus (v.1077) and Pliny (Book IV., c. 16) corroborate the statement by showing that it is its giant inhabitants who gave it thename. And the Secret Doctrine explains both assertions by telling us that all the continents were formed from North toSouth; and that as the sudden change of climate dwarfed the race that had been born on it, arresting its growth, so,several degrees southward, various conditions had always produced the tallest men in every new humanity, or race. Wesee it to this day. The tallest men now found are those in Northern countries, while the smallest are Southern Asiatics,Hindus, Chinamen, Japanese, etc. Compare the tall Sikhs and Punjabees, the Afghans, Norwegians, Russians, NorthernGermans, Scotchmen, and the English, with the inhabitants of central India and the average European on the continent.Thus also the giants of Atlantis, and hence the Titans of Hesiod, are all Northerners.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 778 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.§ VII.SCIENTIFIC AND GEOLOGICAL PROOFS OF THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL SUBMERGED CONTINENTS.IT may not be amiss -- for the benefit of those who resolve the tradition of a lost Miocene Atlantis into an \"antiquatedmyth,\" to append a few scientific admissions on this point. Science, it is true, is largely indifferent to such questions. Butthere are Scientists ready to admit that, in any case, a cautious agnosticism as to geological problems concerning theremote past is far more philosophical than a priori denial, or even hasty generalizations on insufficient data.Meanwhile two very interesting instances, that have been lately met with, may be pointed out as \"confirming\" certainpassages in the letter of a Master, published in \"Esoteric Buddhism.\" The eminence of the authorities will not bequestioned:--[[First Column]]Extract from p. 61 of \"Esoteric Buddhism.\"No. 1. \"The sinking of the Atlantis (the group of continents and islands) began during the Eocene period . . . . and it culminatedin the Miocene, first in the final disappearance of the largest, an event coincident with the elevation of the Alps, andsecond in the sinking of the last of the fair islands mentioned by Plato.\"[[First Column continued on next page]][[Second Column]]Extract from a Lecture by W.

According toMr. Wallace, this epoch may have occurred seventy thousand years ago, while others would assign to it an antiquity of atleast two hundred thousand years, and there are yet others who urge strong arguments on behalf of the opinion that amillion of years is barely enough to have produced the changes which have taken place since that event.\" (Fiske,\"Cosmic [[Footnote continued on next page]]------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 779 GEOLOGY CORROBORATES OCCULTISM.[[First Column continued from previous page]]No. 2.\"Lemuria cannot any more be confounded with the Atlantis continent than Europe with America.

Papuans and Hottentots. . . Australians . . . one division of the Malays.\"[[End of Columns]]With regard to a former civilization, of which a portion of these degraded Australians are the last surviving offshoot, theopinion of Gerland is strongly suggestive. Commenting upon the religion and mythology of the tribes, he writes, \"Thestatement that the Australian civilization (?) indicates a higher grade, is nowhere more clearly proved than here, whereeverything resounds like the expiring voices of a previous and richer age. The idea that the Australians have no religionor mythology is thoroughly false. But this religion is certainly quite deteriorated.\" (Cited in Schmidt's \"Doctrine of Descentof Darwinism,\" pp. 301-2.) As to his other statement, namely, that the Australians are a \"division of the Malays\" (Vide hisethnological theories in the \"Pedigree of Man\"), Haeckel is in error, if he classes the Australians with the rest. The Malaysand Papuans are a mixed stock, resulting from the intermarriages of the low Atlantean sub-races with the Seventh sub-race of the Third Root-Race. Like the Hottentots, they are of indirect Lemuro-Atlantean descent. It is a most suggestivefact -- to those concrete thinkers who demand a physical proof of Karma -- that the lowest races of men are now rapidlydying out; a phenomenon largely due to an extraordinary sterility setting in among the women, from the time that theywere first approached by the Europeans.

It is inaccurate to maintain that theextinction of a lower race is invariably due to cruelties or abuses perpetrated by colonists. Change of diet, drunkenness,etc., etc., have done much; but those who rely on such data as offering an all-sufficient explanation of the crux, cannotmeet the phalanx of facts now so closely arrayed. \"Nothing,\" says even the materialist Lefevre, \"can save those that haverun their course. . . .

The answer that it is due to a \"mental disproportion\" between the colonizing andaboriginal races is obviously evasive, since it does not explain the sudden \"checks to fertility\" which so frequentlysupervene. The dying out of the Hawaiians, for instance, is one of the most mysterious problems of the day. Ethnologywill sooner or later have to recognize with Occultists that the true solution has to be sought for in a comprehension of theworkings of Karma. As Lefevre remarks, \"the time is drawing near when there will remain nothing but three great humantypes\" (before the Sixth Root-Race dawns), the white (Aryan, Fifth Root-Race), the yellow, and the African negro -- withtheir crossings (Atlanto-European divisions). Redskins, Eskimos, Papuans, Australians, Polynesians, etc., etc. -- all aredying out. Those who realize that every Root-Race runs through a gamut of seven sub-races with seven branchlets, etc.,will understand the \"why.\" The tide-wave of incarnating EGOS has rolled past them to harvest experience in moredeveloped and less senile stocks; and their extinction is hence a Karmic necessity. Some extraordinary and unexplainedstatistics as to Race extinction are given in de Quatrefages' \"Human Species,\" p. 428 et seq. No solution, except on theoccult lines, is able to account for these.But we have digressed from our direct subject. Let us hear now what Professor Huxley has to say on the subject offormer Atlantic and Pacific Continents.He writes in \"NATURE,\" Nov. 4th, 1880: \"There is nothing, so far as I am aware, in the biological or geological evidenceat present accessible, to render untenable the hypothesis that an area of the mid-------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 781 TRADITION AS TRUE AS HISTORY.Atlantic or Pacific sea-bed as big as Europe, should have been uplifted as high as Mont Blanc, and have subsided again,any time since the Palaeozoic epoch, if there were any grounds for entertaining it.\"That is to say, then, that there is nothing which can militate against positive evidence to the fact; nothing, therefore,against the geological postulates of the Esoteric Philosophy. Dr. Seemann assures us in the \"Popular Science Review\"(Vol. V., p. 18), article \"Australia and Europe formerly one Continent,\"* that:--\"The facts which botanists have accumulated for reconstructing these lost maps of the globe are rather comprehensive;and they have not been backward in demonstrating the former existence of large tracts of solid land in parts nowoccupied by the great oceans. The many striking points of contact between the present flora of the United States andEastern Asia, induced them to assume that, during the present order of things, there existed a continental connectionbetween South-Eastern Asia and Western America. The singular correspondence of the present flora of the SouthernUnited States with that of the lignite flora of Europe induces them to believe that, in the Miocene period, Europe andAmerica were connected by a land passage, of which Iceland, Madeira, and the other Atlantic islands are remnants; that,in fact, the story of an Atlantis, which an Egyptian priest told to Solon, is not purely fictitious, but rests on a solid historicalbasis. . . . Europe of the Eocene period received the plants which spread over mountains and plains, valleys and river-banks (from Asia generally), neither exclusively from the South nor from the East. The west also furnished additions, andif at that period these were rather meagre, they show, at all events, that the bridge was already building, which, at a lateperiod, was to facilitate communication between the two continents in such a remarkable manner. At that time someplants of the Western Continent began to reach Europe by means of the island of Atlantis, then probably just rising (?)above the ocean.\"And in another number of the same review (Vol. I., p. 143) Mr. Duppa Crotch, M.A., F.L.S., in an article entitled \"TheNorwegian Lemming and its Migrations,\" alludes to the same subject.\"Is it probable that land could have existed where now the broad Atlantic rolls?

The voyage of the 'Challenger'has proved the existence of three long ridges* in the Atlantic Ocean,** one extending for more than three thousand miles,and lateral spurs may, by connecting these ridges, account for the marvellous similarity of the fauna of the Atlanticislands.*** . . . . The submerged continent of LEMURIA, in what is now the Indian Ocean, is considered to afford anexplanation of many difficulties in the distribution of organic life, and, I think, the existence of a MIOCENE ATLANTIS willbe found to have a strong elucidative bearing on subjects of greater interest [Truly So!] than the migration of the lemming.At all events, if it can be shown that land existed in former ages where the North Atlantic now rolls, not only is a motivefound for these apparently suicidal migrations, but also a strong collateral proof that what we call instincts are but theblind and sometimes even prejudicial inheritance of previously acquired experiences.\"(At certain periods, we learn, multitudes of these animals swim to sea and perish.

Mr. Wallace, it must be admitted, has succeeded inexplaining the chief features of existing life-distribution, without bridging the Atlantic or Pacific, except towards the Poles,yet I cannot help thinking that some of the facts might perhaps be more easily explained by admitting the formerexistence of the connection between the coast of Chile and Polynesia* and Great Britain and Florida, shadowed by thesubmarine banks which stretch between them. Nothing is urged that renders the more direct connection impossible, andno physical reason is advanced why the floor of the ocean should not be upheaved from any depth. The route by which(according to the anti-Atlantean and Lemurian hypotheses of Wallace) the floras of South America and Australia aresupposed to have mingled, is beset by almost insurmountable obstacles, and the apparently sudden arrival of a numberof sub-tropical American plants in our Eocene flora, necessitates a connection more to the south than the present 1,000fathom line . . . . forces are unceasingly acting, and there is no reason why an elevating force once set in action in thecentre of an ocean should cease to act until a continent is formed. They have acted and lifted out from the sea, incomparatively recent geological times, the loftiest mountains on earth. Mr. Wallace himself admits repeatedly that sea-beds have been elevated 1,000 fathoms and islands have risen up from the depths of 3,000 fathoms; and to suppose thatthe upheaving forces are limited in power, is, it seems to me, 'utterly gratuitous and entirely opposed to all the evidencesat our command.' \"The \"Father\" of English Geology -- Sir Charles Lyell -- was an Uniformitarian in his views of continental formation. Onpage 492 of his \"Antiquity of Man\" we find him saying:--\"Professor Unger (Die versunkene Insel Atlantis) and Heer (Flora Tertiaria Helvetiae) have admitted on botanical groundsthe former existence of an Atlantic Continent during some part of the Tertiary Period, as affording the only plausibleexplanation that can be imagined of the analogy between the Miocene flora of central Europe, and the existing flora ofEastern America. Professor Oliver, on the other hand, after showing how many of the American types found fossil inEurope are common to Japan, inclines to the theory, first advanced by Dr. Asa Gray, that the migration of species, towhich the community of types in the Eastern States of North America, and the Miocene flora of Europe is due, took placewhen there was an overland communication from America to central Asia between the fiftieth and sixtieth parallels oflatitude, or south of Behring Straits, following the direction of the Aleutian islands. By this course they may have madetheir way, at any epoch, Miocene, Pliocene, or Pleistocene, antecedently to the Glacial Epoch, to Amoorland, on the Eastcoast of North Asia.\"The unnecessary difficulties and complications here incurred in order to avoid the hypothesis of an Atlantic Continent, arereally too[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Pacific portion of the giant Lemurian Continent christened by Dr. Carter Blake, the anthropologist, \"Pacificus.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 784 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.apparent to escape notice. If the botanical evidences stood alone, scepticism would be half legitimate; but in this case allbranches of science converge to one point. Science has made blunders, and has exposed itself to greater errors than theadmission of our two now invisible continents, would lay it open to. It has denied even the undeniable, from the days ofthe mathematician Laplace down to our own, and that only a few years ago.* We have Professor Huxley's authority forsaying that there is no a priori improbability whatever against possible evidences supporting the belief.

Butnow that the POSITIVE EVIDENCE is brought forward, will that eminent scientist admit the corollary?"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Touching on the problem in another place (\"Principles of Geology,\" pp. 12-13), Sir Charles Lyell tells us: \"Respecting thecosmogony of the Egyptian priests, we gather much information from writers of the Grecian sects, who borrowed almostall their tenets from Egypt, and amongst others that of the former successive destruction and renovation of the world.(Continental, not cosmic, catastrophes.) We learn from Plutarch that this was the theme of one of the hymns of Orpheus,so celebrated in the fabulous ages of Greece. It was brought by him from the banks of the Nile; and we even find in hisverses, as in the Indian systems, a definite period assigned for the duration of every successive World. The returns ofgreat catastrophes were determined by the present period of the Magnus Annus, or great year -- a cycle composed of therevolutions of the sun, moon, and planets, and terminating when these return together to the sign whence they weresupposed at some remote epoch to set out. We learn particularly from the Timaeus of Plato that the Egyptians believedthe world to be subject to occasional conflagrations and deluges. The sect of the Stoics adopted most fully the system ofcatastrophes destined at intervals to destroy the world. These, they taught, were of two kinds -- the cataclysm, ordestruction by water, and the Ecpyrosis, or destruction by fire (submarine volcanoes). From the Egyptians they derivedthe doctrine of the gradual debasement of man from a state of innocence\" (nascent simplicity of the first sub-races ofeach Root-Race). \"Towards the[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* When Howard read, before the Royal Society of London, a paper on the first serious researches that were made on theaerolites, the Geneva naturalist Pictet, who was present, communicated, on his return to Paris, the facts reported to theFrench Academy of Sciences. But he was forthwith interrupted by Laplace, the great astronomer, who cried: \"Stop! wehave had enough of such fables, and know all about them,\" thus making Pictet feel very small. Globular-shaped lightningsor thunderbolts have been admitted by Science only since Arago demonstrated their existence, says de Rochat (\"Forcesnon-definies,\" p. 4): \"Every one remembers Dr. Bouilland's misadventure at the Academy of Medicine when he haddeclared Edison's phonograph 'a trick of ventriloquism! ` \"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 785 ASTRAEA FALLS ON HER HEAD.termination of each era the gods could no longer bear with the wickedness of man, and a shock of the elements, or adeluge, overwhelmed them; (vide degeneracy into magical practices and gross animality of the Atlanteans) after whichcalamity, Astraea again descended on the earth to renew the golden age.\" (Dawn of a new Root-Race.)Astraea, the goddess of justice, is the last of the deities to forsake the earth, when the gods are said to abandon it and betaken up into heaven by Jupiter again. But, no sooner does Zeus carry away from earth Ganymedes (the object of lust,personified) than the father of the gods throws down Astraea back on the earth again, on which she falls upon her head.Astraea is Virgo, the constellation of the Zodiac. Astronomically it has a very plain significance, and one which gives theKey to the occult meaning. But it is inseparable from Leo, the sign that precedes it, and from the Pleiades and theirsisters, the Hyades, of which Aldebaran is the brilliant leader. All of these are connected with the periodical renovations ofthe earth, with regard to its continents -- even Ganymedes, who in astronomy is Aquarius. It was already shown that whilethe South Pole is the pit (or the infernal regions figuratively and cosmologically), the North Pole is geographically the firstcontinent; while astronomically and metaphorically the celestial pole, with its pole star in heaven, is Meru, or the seat ofBrahma, the throne of Jupiter, etc. For in the age when the gods forsook the earth and were said to ascend into heaven,the ecliptic had become parallel with the meridian, and part of the Zodiac appeared to descend from the north pole to thenorth horizon. Aldebaran was in conjunction then with the Sun, as it was 40,000 years ago, at the great festival incommemoration of that Magnus Annus, of which Plutarch was speaking. Since that year (40,000 years ago) there hasbeen a retrograde motion of the equator, and about 31,000 years ago Aldebaran was in conjunction with the vernalequinoctial point. The part assigned to Taurus, even in Christian mysticism, is too well known to need repetition. Thefamous Orphic hymn on the great periodical cataclysm divulges the whole esotericism of the event. Pluto (in the pit)carries off Eurydice, bitten by the (polar) serpent. Then Leo, the lion, is vanquished. Now, when the Lion is in the pit, orbelow the south pole, then Virgo, as the next sign, follows him, and when her head, down to the waist, is below the Southhorizon -- she is inverted. On the other hand, the Hyades are the rain or Deluge constellations; and Aldebaran (he whofollows, or succeeds the daughters of Atlas, or the Pleiades) looks down from the eye of Taurus. It is from this point of theecliptic that the calculations of the new cycle were commenced. The student has to remember also, that whenGanymedes (Aquarius) is raised to------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 786 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.heaven (or above the horizon of the North Pole) Virgo or Astraea, who is Venus-Lucifer, descends head downwardsbelow the horizon of the South Pole, or the pit; which pit, or the pole, is also the Great Dragon, or the Flood. Let thestudent exercise his intuition by placing these facts together; no more can be said.\"The connection,\" comments Lyell, \"between the doctrine of successive catastrophes and repeated deteriorations in themoral character of the human race, is more intimate and natural than might at first be imagined. For, in a rude state ofsociety, all great calamities are regarded by the people as judgments of God on the wickedness of man. . . . In likemanner in the account given to Solon by the Egyptian priests of the submersion of the island of Atlantis under the watersof the ocean, after repeated shocks of an earthquake, we find that the event happened when Jupiter had seen the moraldepravity of the inhabitants.\"True; but was it not owing to the fact that all esoteric truths were given out to the public by the Initiates of the templesunder the guise of allegories? \"Jupiter,\" is merely the personification of that immutable Cyclic Law, which arrests thedownward tendency of each Root-Race, after attaining the zenith of its glory.* Unless we hold with Prof. John Fiske'ssingularly dogmatic opinion** that every myth \"is an explanation by the uncivilized mind, of some natural phenomenon;not an allegory, not an esoteric symbol, for the ingenuity is wasted (! !) which strives to detect in myths the remnants of arefined primeval science -- but an explanation. Primitive men had no profound science to perpetuate by means of allegory[How does Mr. Fiske know?], nor were they such sorry pedants as to talk in riddles when plain language would serve theirpurpose.\" We venture to say the language of the Initiated few was far more \"plain,\" and their science-philosophy far morecom-"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* The Cyclic Law of Race-Evolution is most unwelcome to scientists. It is sufficient to mention the fact of \"primevalcivilization\" to excite the frenzy of Darwinians; it being obvious that the further culture and science is pushed back, themore precarious becomes the basis of the ape-ancestor theory. But as Jacolliot says:-- \"Whatever there may be in thesetraditions (submerged continents, etc.), and whatever may have been the place where a civilization more ancient thanthat of Rome, of Greece, of Egypt, and of India, was developed, it is certain that this civilization did exist, and it is highlyimportant for Science to recover its traces, however feeble and fugitive they be.\" (Histoire des Vierges; les peuples et lescontinents disparus, p. 15.) Donnelly has proved the fact from the clearest premises, but the Evolutionists will not listen. AMiocene civilization upsets the \"universal stone-age\" theory, and that of a continuous ascent of man from animalism! Andyet Egypt, at least, runs counter to current hypotheses. There is no stone-age visible there, but a more glorious culture isapparent, the further back we are enabled to carry our retrospect. (Verb.

What, however, is Sir Charles Lyell's \"explanation\" ofthe \"myth\"? Certainly, he in no way countenances the idea of its \"astronomical\" origin, as asserted by some writers.The two interpreters are entirely at variance with one another. Lyell's solution is as follows. A disbeliever in cataclysmalchanges, from the absence (?) of any reliable historical data on the point, as well as from a strong bias to theUniformitarian conceptions of geologic changes,* he attempts to trace the Atlantis \"tradition\" to the following sources:--(1) Barbarous tribes connect catastrophes with an avenging God, who is assumed in this way to punish immoral races.(2) Hence the commencement of a new race is logically a virtuous one.(3) The primary source of the geologic basis of the tradition was Asia -- a continent subject to violent earthquakes.Exaggerated accounts would thus be handed down the ages.(4) Egypt, being herself free from earthquakes, nevertheless based her not inconsiderable geologic knowledge on thesecataclysmal traditions.An ingenious \"explanation,\" as all such are. But proving a negative is proverbially a difficult task. Students of esotericscience, who know what the resources of the Egyptian priesthood really were, need no such laboured hypothesis.Moreover, while an imaginative theorist is always able to furnish a reasonable solution of problems which, in one branchof science, seem to necessitate the hypothesis of periodical cataclysmic changes on the surface of our planet, theimpartial critic, who is not a[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Violent minor cataclysms and colossal earthquakes are recorded in the annals of most nations -- if not of all. Elevationand subsidence of continents is always in progress. The whole coast of South America has been raised up 10 to 15 feetand settled down again in an hour. Huxley has shown that the British islands have been four times depressed beneaththe ocean and subsequently raised again and peopled. The Alps, Himalayas and Cordilleras were all the result ofdepositions drifted on to sea-bottoms and upheaved by Titanic forces to their present elevation. The Sahara was thebasin of a Miocene sea. Within the last five or six thousand years the shores of Sweden, Denmark and Norway have risenfrom 200 to 600 feet; in Scotland there are raised beaches with outlying stacks and skerries surmounting the shore noweroded by the hungry wave. The North of Europe is still rising from the sea and South America presents the phenomenonof raised beaches of over 1,000 miles in length, now at a height varying from 100 to 1,300 feet above the sea-level. Onthe other hand, the coast of Greenland is sinking fast, so much so that the Greenlander will not build by the shore. Allthese phenomena are certain. Why may not a gradual change have given place to a violent cataclysm in remote epochs?-- such cataclysms occurring on a minor scale even now (e.g., the case of Sunda island with 80,000 Malays).------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 788 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.specialist, will recognise the immense difficulty of explaining away the cumulative evidences, -- namely, thearchaeological, ethnological, geological, traditional, botanical, and even biological -- in favour of former continents nowsubmerged. When each science is fighting for its own hand, the cumulative force of the evidence in its collectivity isalmost invariably lost sight of.In the \"Theosophist\" (August, 1880), we wrote: \"We have as evidences the most ancient traditions of various and wide-separated peoples -- legends in India, in ancient Greece, Madagascar, Sumatra, Java, and all the principal isles ofPolynesia, as well as the legends of both Americas. Among savages; and in the traditions of the richest literature in theworld -- the Sanskrit literature of India -- there is an agreement in saying, that, ages ago, there existed in the PacificOcean, a large Continent, which by a geological cataclysm was engulfed by the sea,* (Lemuria). And it is our firm belief . .. that most, if not all, of the islands from the Malayan archipelago to Polynesia, are fragments of that once immensesubmerged Continent. Both Malacca and Polynesia, which lie at the two extremities of the ocean, and which, since thememory of man never had, and never could have any intercourse with, or even a knowledge of each other, have yet atradition common to all the islands and islets, that their respective countries extended far, far into the Sea: that there werein the world but two immense continents, one inhabited by yellow, the other by dark men; and that the Ocean, bycommand of the gods, and to punish them for their incessant quarrelling, swallowed them up.

R. Wallace, in his \"Malay Archipelago,\" arrives at the following conclusion after a review of the mass of evidence athand:-- \"The inference that we must draw from these facts is undoubtedly that the whole of the islands eastwards beyondBorneo and Sumatra do essentially form part of a former Australian or Pacific Continent . . . This continent must havebeen broken up before the extreme south-eastern portion of Asia was raised above the waters of the ocean, for a greatpart of the land of Borneo and Java is known to be geologically of quite recent formation.\"According to Haeckel:-- \"Southern Asia itself was not the earliest cradle of the human race, but Lemuria, a continent thatlay to the South of Asia, and sank later on beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean.\" (\"Pedigree of Man,\" Eng. Trans. p.73.) In one sense Haeckel is right as to Lemuria -- the \"cradle of the Human race.\" That continent was the home of thefirst physical Human Stock -- the later Third-Race Men. Previous to that epoch the Races were far less consolidated andphysiologically quite different. (Haeckel makes Lemuria extend from Sunda Island to Africa and Madagascar andeastwards to Upper India.)Professor Rutimeyer, the eminent Palaeontologist, asks:-- \"Need the conjecture that the almost exclusively graminivorousand insectivorous marsupials, sloths, armadilloes, ant-eaters and ostriches, once possessed an actual point of union in aSouthern Continent of which the present flora of Terra del Fuego and Australia must be the remains -- need thisconjecture raise difficulties at a moment when from their fossil remains, Heer restores to sight the ancient forests ofSmith's Sound and Spitzbergen.\" (Cited in Schmidt's \"Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,\" p. 237.)Having now dealt generally with the broad scientific attitude on the two questions, it will, perhaps, conduce to anagreeable brevity, if we sum up the more striking isolated facts in favour of that fundamental contention of EsotericEthnologists -- the reality of Atlantis. Lemuria[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* \"Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,\" p. 236. (Cf. also his lengthy arguments on the subject, pp. 231-7.)------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 790 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.is so widely accepted, that further pursuit of the subject is unnecessary. With regard, however, to the former, it is foundthat:--(1) The Miocene flora of Europe have their most numerous and striking analogues in the flora of the United States. In theforests of Virginia and Florida are found the magnolias, tulip-trees, evergreen oaks, plane trees, etc., etc., etc., whichcorrespond with European Tertiary flora term for term. How was the migration effected, if we exclude the theory of anAtlantic Continent bridging the ocean between America and Europe? The proposed \"explanation\" to the effect that thetransition was by way of Asia and the Aleutian islands is a mere uncalled-for theory, obviously upset by the fact that alarge number of these flora only appear EAST of the Rocky Mountains. This also negatives the idea of a trans-Pacificmigration. They are now superseded by European continents and islands to the North.(2) Skulls exhumed on the banks of the Danube and Rhine bear a striking similarity to those of the Caribs and OldPeruvians (Littre). Monuments have been exhumed in Central America, which bear representations of undoubted negroheads and faces. How are such facts to be accounted for except on the Atlantean hypothesis? What is now N. W. Africawas once connected with Atlantis by a network of islands, few of which now remain.(3) According to Farrar (\"Families of Speech\") the \"isolated language\" of the Basques has no affinities with the otherlanguages* of Europe, but with \"the aboriginal languages of the vast opposite continent (America) and those alone.\"Professor Broca is also of the same opinion.Palaeolithic European man of the Miocene and Pliocene times was a pure Atlantean, as we have previously stated. TheBasques are, of course, of a much later date than this, but their affinities, as here shown, go far to prove the original"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"extraction of their remote ancestors. The \"mysterious\" affinity between their tongue and that of the Dravidian races ofIndia will be understood by those who have followed our outline of continental formations and shiftings.(4) Stones have been found in the Canary Islands bearing sculptured symbols similar to those found on the shore of LakeSuperior.

Davis is disposed to concede, from an examination of the skulls of the Guanches of the CanaryIslands and modern Basques, that both belong to a race proper to those ancient islands, of which the Canaries are theremains!! This is a step in advance indeed. De Quatrefages and Hamy also both assign the Cro-Magnon men of SouthFrance and the Guanches to one type -- a proposition which involves a certain corollary which both these writers may notcare to father.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 791 FINAL AND IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE.by such evidence to postulate the unity of race of the early men of Canary Islands and America (Cf. Benjamin, the\"Atlantic Islands,\" p. 130.)The Guanches of the Canary Islands were lineal descendants of the Atlanteans. This fact will account for the greatstature evidenced by their old skeletons, as well as by those of their European congeners the Cro-Magnon Palaeolithicmen.(5) Any experienced mariner has but to navigate the fathomless ocean along the Canary Islands to ask himself thequestion when or how that group of volcanic and rocky little islands has been formed, surrounded on every side by thatvast watery space. Such frequent questions led finally to the expedition of the famous Leopold von Buch, which tookplace in the first quarter of the present century. Some geologists maintained that the volcanic islands had been raisedright from the bottom of the ocean, the depth of which in the immediate vicinity of the island varies from 6,000 to 18,000feet. Others were inclined to see in these groups, including Madeira, the Azores, and the islands of Cape de Verdes -- theremnants of a gigantic but submerged continent which had once united Africa with America. The latter men of sciencesupported their hypothesis by a mass of evidence in its favour, drawn from ancient \"myths.\" Hoary \"superstitions,\" suchas the fairy-like Atlantis of Plato, the Garden of Hesperides, Atlas supporting the world on his shoulders, all of themmythoi connected with the peak of Teneriffe, did not go far with sceptical Science. The identity of animal and vegetablespecies -- showing either a previous connection between America and the remaining groups of the islands -- (thehypothesis of their having been drifted from the New to the Old World by the waves was too absurd to stand long) --found more serious consideration. But it is only quite lately, and after Donnelly's book had been published several years,that the theory has greater chances than ever of becoming an accepted fact. Fossils found on the Eastern Coast of SouthAmerica have now been proved to belong to the Jurassic formations, and are nearly identical with the Jurassic fossils ofWestern Europe and Northern Africa. The geological structure of both coasts is also almost identical; the resemblancebetween the smaller marine animals dwelling in the more shallow waters of South America, the Western African, and theSouth European coasts, is also very great. All such facts are bound to bring naturalists to the conclusion that there hasbeen, in distant pre-historic ages, a continent which extended from the coast of Venezuela, across the Atlantic Ocean, tothe Canarese Islands and North Africa, and from Newfoundland nearly to the coast of France.(6) The great resemblance between the Jurassic fossils of South------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 792 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.America, North Africa, and Western Europe is a striking enough fact in itself, and admits of no explanation, unless theocean is bridged with an Atlantis. But why, also, is there so marked a similarity between the fauna (animal life) of the --now -- isolated Atlantic islands? Why did the specimens of Brazilian fauna dredged up by Sir C. Wyville Thompsonresemble those of Western Europe? Why does a resemblance exist between many of the West African and West Indiananimal groups? Again:\"When the animals and plants of the Old and New World are compared, one cannot but be struck with their identity; all,nearly all belong to the same genera, while many, even of the species, are common to both continents . . . indicating thatthey radiated from a common centre\" (Atlantis), (\"Westminster Review,\" Jan., 1872).The horse, according to Science, originated in America. At least, a large proportion of the once \"missing links\" connectingit with inferior forms have been exhumed from American strata. How did the horse penetrate into Europe and Asia, if noland communication bridged the oceanic interspaces? Or if it is asserted that the horse originated in the New World, howdid such forms as the hipparion, etc., get into America in the first instance on the migration hypothesis?Again \"Buffon had . . . remarked in the repetition of the African in the American fauna, how, for example, the lama is ajuvenescent and feeble copy of the camel, and how the puma of the New represented the lion of the Old World\" (Schmidt,\"Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism,\" p. 223).(7) The following quotation runs with No. (2), but its significance is such and the writer cited so authoritative, that itdeserves a place to itself:--\"With regard to the primitive dolichocephalae of America, I entertain a hypothesis still more bold, namely, that they arenearly related to the Guanches of the Canary Islands, and to the Atlantic populations of Africa, the Moors, Tuaricks,Copts, which Latham comprises under the name of Egyptian-Atlantidae. We find one and the same form of skull in theCanary Islands, in front of the African coast, and in the Carib islands, on the opposite coast which faces Africa. The colour"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"of the skin on both sides of the Atlantic is represented in these populations as being of a reddish-brown.\" (ProfessorRetzius, \"Smithsonian Report,\" 1859, p. 266.)If, then, Basques and Cro-Magnon Cave-Men are of the same race as the Canarese Guanches, it follows that the formerare also allied to the aborigines of America. This is the conclusion which the independent investigations of Retzius,Virchow, and de Quatrefages necessitate. The Atlantean affinities of these three types become patent.(8) The sea-soundings undertaken by H.M.S. \"Challenger\" and the \"Dolphin,\" have established the fact that a hugeelevation some 3,000 miles in length, projecting upwards from the abysmal depths of the------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 793 RECENT SUGGESTIVE DISCOVERIES.Atlantic, extends from a point near the British Islands southwards, curving round near Cape de Verde, and running in asouth-easterly direction along the West African Coast. This elevation averages some 9,000 feet in height, and risesabove the waves at the Azores, Ascension, and other places. In the ocean depths around the neighbourhood of theformer the ribs of a former massive piece of land have been discovered (vide investigations of United States Ship\"Dolphin\" and others). \"The inequalities, the mountains and valleys of its surface could never have been produced inaccordance with any known laws for the deposition of sediment, nor by submarine elevation; but, on the contrary, musthave been carved by agencies acting above the water-level.\" -- (Scientific American, July 28th, 1877). It is most probablethat necks of land formerly existed knitting Atlantis to South America, somewhere above the mouth of the Amazon; toAfrica near Cape de Verde, while a similar point of juncture with Spain is not unlikely, as contended for by Donnelly. (Videhis chart, \"Atlantis,\" p. 47, Eng. Ed., 1884, though he deals with only a fragment of the real continent.) Whether the latterexisted or not, is of no consequence, as the fact that (what is now) N. W. Africa was -- before the elevation of the Saharaand the rupture of the Gibraltar connection -- an extension of Spain. Consequently no difficulty can be raised as to howthe migration of the European fauna (etc.) took place.Enough has now been said from the purely scientific standpoint, and it is needless, in view of the manner in which thesubject has now been developed on the lines of esoteric knowledge, to swell the mass of testimony further. In conclusion,the words of one of the most intuitive writers of the day may be cited as admirably illustrative of the opinions of theoccultist, who awaits in patience the dawn of the coming day:--\"We are but beginning to understand the past; one hundred years ago the world knew nothing of Pompeii orHerculaneum; nothing of the lingual tie that binds together the Indo-European nations; nothing of the significance of thevast volume of inscriptions upon the tombs and temples of Egypt; nothing of the meaning of the arrow-headedinscriptions of Babylon; nothing of the marvellous civilizations revealed in the remains of Yucatan, Mexico, and Peru. Weare on the threshold. Scientific investigation is advancing with giant strides. Who shall say that one hundred years fromnow, the great museums of the world may not be adorned with gems, statues, arms, and implements from Atlantis, whilethe libraries of the world shall contain translations of its inscriptions, throwing new light upon all the past history of thehuman race, and all the great problems which now perplex the thinkers of to-day.\"*[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Donnelly, \"Atlantis; the Ante-Diluvian World,\" p. 480.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 794 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.And now to conclude.-------We have concerned ourself with the ancient records of the nations, with the doctrine of chronological and psychic cycles,of which these records are the tangible proof; and with many other subjects, which may, at first sight, seem out of place inthis volume.But they were necessary in truth. In dealing with the secret annals and traditions of so many nations, whose very originshave never been ascertained on more secure grounds than inferential suppositions, in giving out the beliefs andphilosophy of more than prehistoric races, it is not quite as easy to deal with the subject matter as it would be if only thephilosophy of one special race, and its evolution, were concerned. The Secret Doctrine is the common property of thecountless millions of men born under various climates, in times with which History refuses to deal, and to which esotericteachings assign dates incompatible with the theories of Geology and Anthropology. The birth and evolution of theSacred Science of the Past are lost in the very night of Time; and that, even, which is historic -- i.e., that which is foundscattered hither and thither throughout ancient classical literature -- is, in almost every case, attributed by moderncriticism to lack of observation in the ancient writers, or to superstition born out of the ignorance of antiquity. It is,therefore, impossible to treat this subject as one would the ordinary evolution of an art or science in some well-knownhistorical nation. It is only by bringing before the reader an abundance of proofs all tending to show that in every age,under every condition of civilization and knowledge, the educated classes of every nation made themselves the more orless faithful echoes of one identical system and its fundamental traditions -- that he can be made to see that so manystreams of the same water must have had a common source from which they started. What was this source? If comingevents are said to cast their shadows before, past events cannot fall to leave their impress behind them. It is, then, bythose shadows of the hoary Past and their fantastic silhouettes on the external screen of every religion and philosophy,that we can, by checking them as we go along, and comparing them, trace out finally the body that produced them. Theremust be truth and fact in that which every people of antiquity accepted and made the foundation of its religions and itsfaith. Moreover, as Haliburton said, \"Hear one side, and you will be in the dark; hear both sides, and all will be clear.\" Thepublic has hitherto had access to, and heard but one side -- or rather the two one-sided views of two diametricallyopposed classes of men, whose prima facie propositions or respective premises differ widely, but whose final conclusionsare the same -- Science and Theology. And now our"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 795 OLD MASONIC SYMBOLISM.readers have an opportunity to hear the other -- the defendants' -- justification on and learn the nature of our arguments.Were the public to be left to its old opinions: namely, on one side, that Occultism, Magic, the legends of old, etc., were allthe outcome of ignorance and superstition; and on the other, that everything outside the orthodox groove was the work ofthe devil, what would be the result? In other words, had no theosophical and mystic literature obtained a hearing for thefew last years, the present work would have had a poor chance of impartial consideration. It would have been proclaimed-- and by many will still be so proclaimed -- a fairy tale woven out of abstruse problems, poised in, and based on the air;built of soap bubbles, bursting at the slightest touch of serious reflection, with no foundation, as it would be alleged, tostand upon. Even \"the ancient superstitious and credulous classics\" have no word of reference to it in clear andunmistakable terms, and the symbols themselves fail to yield a hint at the existence of such a system. Such would be theverdict of all. But when it becomes undeniably proven that the claim of the modern Asiatic nations to a Secret Scienceand an esoteric history of the world, is based on fact; that, though hitherto unknown to the masses and a veiled mysteryeven to the learned, (because they never had the key to a right understanding of the abundant hints thrown out by theancient classics), it is still no fairy tale, but an actuality -- then the present work will become but the pioneer of many moresuch books. The statement that hitherto even the keys discovered by some great scholars have proved too rusty for use,and that they were but the silent witnesses that there do exist mysteries behind the veil which are unreachable without anew key -- is borne out by too many proofs to be easily dismissed. An instance may be given as an illustration out of thehistory of Freemasonry.In his \"Franc-maconnerie Occulte,\" rightly or wrongly, Ragon, an illustrious and learned Belgian Mason, reproaches theEnglish Masons with having materialized and dishonoured Masonry, once based upon the Ancient Mysteries, byadopting, owing to a mistaken notion of the origin of the craft, the name of Free Masonry and Free Masons. The mistakeis due, he says, to those who connect Masonry with the building of Solomon's Temple, deriving its origin from it. Hederides the idea, and says: . . \"The Franc Mason (which is not macon libre, or free masonry) knew well when adopting thetitle, that it was no question of building a wall, but that of being initiated into the ancient Mysteries veiled under the nameof Francmaconnerie (Freemasonry); that his work was only to be the continuation or the renovation of the ancientmysteries, and that he was to become a mason after the manner of Apollo or Amphion. And do not we know that theancient initiated poets, when speaking of the foundation------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 796 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.of a city, meant thereby the establishment of a doctrine? Thus Neptune, the god of reasoning, and Apollo, the god of thehidden things, presented themselves as masons before Laomedon, Priam's father, to help him to build the city of Troy --that is to say, to establish the Trojan religion.\" (Maconnerie Orthodoxe, p. 44.)Such veiled sentences with double meaning abound in ancient classical writers. Therefore, had an attempt been made toshow that, e.g., Laomedon was the founder of a branch of archaic mysteries in which the earth-bound material soul (thefourth principle), was personified in Menelaus' faithless wife (the fair Helen), if Ragon had not come to corroborate whatwe asserted, we might be told that no classical author speaks of it, and that Homer shows Laomedon building a city, notan esoteric worship or MYSTERIES! And who are those left now, save a few Initiates, who understand the language andcorrect meaning of such symbolical terms?But after having pointed to many a misconceived symbol bearing on our thesis, there still remains more than one difficultyto be overcome. Most important among several such obstacles is that of chronology. But this could hardly be helped.Wedged in between theological chronology and that of the geologists, backed by all the materialistic Anthropologists whoassign dates to man and nature which fit in with their own theories alone -- what could the writer do except what is beingdone? Namely, since theology places the Deluge 2448 B.C., and the World's Creation only 5890 years ago; and since theaccurate researches by the methods of exact Science, have led the geologists and physicists to assign to the incrustedage of our Globe between 10 million and 1,000 million of years* (a trifling difference, verily!): and the Anthropologists tovary their divergence of opinion as to the appearance of man -- between 25,000 and 500,000 of years -- what can onewho studies the Occult doctrine do, but come out and bravely present the esoteric calculations before the world?But to do this, corroboration by even a few \"historical\" proofs was necessary, though all know the real value of the so-called \"historical evidence.\" For, whether man had appeared on earth 18,000 or 18,000,000 years ago, can make nodifference to profane History, since it begins hardly a couple of thousand years before our era, and since, even then, itgrapples hopelessly with the clash and din of contradictory and mutually-destroying opinions around it. Nevertheless, inview of the respect the average reader has been brought up in for exact science, even that short Past would remainmeaningless, unless the esoteric teachings were corroborated and supported on the spot --[[Footnote(s)]] -------------------------------------------------* Vide Sir W. Thomson and Mr. Huxley.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 797 THE PROLOGUE TO ESOTERIC TRUTH.whenever possible -- by references to historical names of a so-called historical period. This is the only guide that can begiven to the beginner before he is permitted to start among the (to him) unfamiliar windings of that dark labyrinth calledthe pre-historic ages. This necessity has been complied with. It is only hoped that the desire to do so, which has led thewriter to be constantly bringing ancient and modern evidence as a corroboration of the Archaic and quite unhistoric Past,will not bring on her the accusation of having sorely jumbled up without order or method the various and widely-separated"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"periods of history and tradition. But literary form and method had to be sacrificed to the greater clearness of the generalexposition.To accomplish the proposed task, the writer had to resort to the rather unusual means of dividing each volume or Bookinto three Parts; the first of which only is the consecutive, though very fragmentary, history of the Cosmogony and theEvolution of Man on this globe. But these two volumes had to serve as a PROLOGUE, and prepare the reader's mind forthose which shall now follow. In treating of Cosmogony and then of the Anthropogenesis of mankind, it was necessary toshow that no religion, since the very earliest, has ever been entirely based on fiction, as none was the object of specialrevelation; and that it is dogma alone which has ever been killing primeval truth. Finally, that no human-born doctrine, nocreed, however sanctified by custom and antiquity, can compare in sacredness with the religion of Nature. The Key ofWisdom that unlocks the massive gates leading to the arcana of the innermost sanctuaries can be found hidden in herbosom only: and that bosom is in the countries pointed to by the great seer of the past century Emanuel Swedenborg.There lies the heart of nature, that shrine whence issued the early races of primeval Humanity, and which is the cradle ofphysical man.Thus far have proceeded the rough outlines of the beliefs and tenets of the archaic, earliest Races contained in theirhitherto secret Scriptural records. But our explanations are by no means complete, nor do they pretend to give out the fulltext, or to have been read by the help of more than three or four keys out of the sevenfold bunch of esotericinterpretation, and even this has only been partially accomplished. The work is too gigantic for any one person toundertake, far more to accomplish. Our main concern was simply to prepare the soil. This, we trust we have done. Thesetwo volumes only constitute the work of a pioneer who has forced his way into the well-nigh impenetrable jungle of thevirgin forests of the Land of the Occult. A commencement has been made to fell and uproot the deadly upas trees ofsuperstition, prejudice, and conceited ignorance, so that these two------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page]] 798 THE SECRET DOCTRINE.volumes should form for the student a fitting prelude for Volumes III. and IV. Until the rubbish of the ages is cleared awayfrom the minds of the Theosophists to whom these volumes are dedicated, it is impossible that the more practicalteaching contained in the Third Volume should be understood. Consequently, it entirely depends upon the reception withwhich Volumes I. and II. will meet at the hands of Theosophists and Mystics, whether these last two volumes will ever bepublished, though they are almost completed.Satyat Nasti paro dharmah.THERE IS NO RELIGION HIGHER THAN TRUTH.End of Vol. II.------------------------------------------------------------------------[[Vol. 2, Page 799]]INDEX[[not included in this electronic edition]]------------------------------------------------------------------------"}]
