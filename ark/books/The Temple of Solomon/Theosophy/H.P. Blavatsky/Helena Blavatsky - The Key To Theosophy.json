The Key to Theosophy  A Clear Exposition in the Form of Question and Answer of the Ethics, Science, and Philosophy  for the Study of Which The Theosophical Society has been Founded.  H.P. BlavatskyPrefaceThe purpose of this book is exactly expressed in its title, The Key toTheosophy, and needs but few words of explanation. It is not a complete orexhaustive textbook of Theosophy, but only a key to unlock the door thatleads to the deeper study. It traces the broad outlines of theWisdom-Religion, and explains its fundamental principles; meeting, at thesame time, the various objections raised by the average Western inquirer,and endeavoring to present unfamiliar concepts in a form as simple and inlanguage as clear as possible. That it should succeed in making Theosophyintelligible without mental effort on the part of the reader, would be toomuch to expect; but it is hoped that the obscurity still left is of thethought and not of the language, is due to depth and not to confusion. Tothe mentally lazy or obtuse, Theosophy must remain a riddle; for in theworld mental as in the world spiritual each man must progress by his ownefforts. The writer cannot do the reader's thinking for him, nor would thelatter be any the better off if such vicarious thought were possible. Theneed for such an exposition as the present has long been felt among thoseinterested in the Theosophical Society and its work, and it is hoped that itwill supply information, as free as possible from technicalities, to manywhose attention has been awakened, but who, as yet, are merely puzzled andnot convinced.Some care has been taken in disentangling some part of what is true fromwhat is false in Spiritualistic teachings as to the postmortem life, and toshowing the true nature of Spiritualistic phenomena. Previous explanationsof a similar kind have drawn much wrath upon the writer's devoted head; theSpiritualists, like too many others, preferring to believe what is pleasantrather than what is true, and becoming very angry with anyone who destroysan agreeable delusion. For the past year Theosophy has been the target forevery poisoned arrow of Spiritualism, as though the possessors of a halftruth felt more antagonism to the possessors of the whole truth than thosewho had no share to boast of.Very hearty thanks are due from the author to many Theosophists who havesent suggestions and questions, or have otherwise contributed help duringthe writing of this book. The work will be the more useful for their aid,and that will be their best reward.-H.P.

Theosophy and its doctrines are often referred to as a newfangledreligion. Is it a religion?A. It is not. Theosophy is Divine Knowledge or Science.Q. What is the real meaning of the term?A. \"Divine Wisdom,\" (Theosophia) or Wisdom of the gods, as (theogonia),genealogy of the gods. The word 'theos' means a god in Greek, one of thedivine beings, certainly not \"God\" in the sense attached in our day to theterm. Therefore, it is not \"Wisdom of God,\" as translated by some, butDivine Wisdom such as that possessed by the gods. The term is many thousandyears old.Q. What is the origin of the name?A. It comes to us from the Alexandrian philosophers, called lovers of truth,Philaletheians, from (phil) \"loving,\" and (aletheia) \"truth.\" The namePage 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtTheosophy dates from the third century of our era, and began with AmmoniusSaccas and his disciples, also called Analogeticists, who started theEclectic Theosophical system.As explained by Professor Wilder, they were called so because of theirpractice of interpreting all sacred legends and narratives, myths andmysteries, by a rule or principle of analogy and correspondence: so thatevents which were related as having occurred in the external world wereregarded as expressing operations and experiences of the human soul. Theywere also denominated Neo-Platonists. Though Theosophy, or the EclecticTheosophical system, is generally attributed to the third century, yet, ifDiogenes Laërtius is to be credited, its origin is much earlier, as heattributed the system to an Egyptian priest, Pot-Amun, who lived in theearly days of the Ptolemaic dynasty. The same author tells us that the nameis Coptic, and signifies one consecrated to Amun, the God of Wisdom.Theosophy is the equivalent of Brahma-Vidya , divine knowledge.Q. What was the object of this system?A. First of all to inculcate certain great moral truths upon its disciples,and all those who were \"lovers of the truth.\" Hence the motto adopted by theTheosophical Society: \"There is no religion higher than truth.\"Eclectic Theosophy was divided under three heads:1. Belief in one absolute, incomprehensible and supreme Deity, or infiniteessence, which is the root of all nature, and of all that is, visible andinvisible.2. Belief in man's eternal immortal nature, because, being a radiation ofthe Universal Soul, it is of an identical essence with it.3. Theurgy, or \"divine work,\" or producing a work of gods; from theoi,\"gods,\" and ergein, \"to work.\"The term is very old, but, as it belongs to the vocabulary of the mysteries,was not in popular use. It was a mystic belief-practically proven byinitiated adepts and priests-that, by making oneself as pure as theincorporeal beings-i.e., by returning to one's pristine purity of nature-mancould move the gods to impart to him Divine mysteries, and even cause themto become occasionally visible, either subjectively or objectively. It wasthe transcendental aspect of what is now called Spiritualism; but havingbeen abused and misconceived by the populace, it had come to be regarded bysome as necromancy, and was generally forbidden. A travestied practice ofthe theurgy of Iamblichus lingers still in the ceremonial magic of somemodern Cabalists. Modern Theosophy avoids and rejects both these kinds ofmagic and \"necromancy\" as being very dangerous. Real divine theurgy requiresan almost superhuman purity and holiness of life; otherwise it degeneratesinto mediumship or black magic. The immediate disciples of Ammonius Saccas,who was called Theodidaktos, \"god-taught\"-such as Plotinus and his followerPorphyry-rejected theurgy at first, but were finally reconciled to itthrough Iamblichus, who wrote a work to that effect entitled De Mysteriis,under the name of his own master, a famous Egyptian priest called Abammon.Ammonius Saccas was the son of Christian parents, and, having been repelledby dogmatic Spiritualistic Christianity from his childhood, became aNeo-Platonist, and like J. Boëhme and other great seers and mystics, is saidto have had divine wisdom revealed to him in dreams and visions. Hence hisname of Theodidaktos. He resolved to reconcile every system of religion, andby demonstrating their identical origin to establish one universal creedbased on ethics. His life was so blameless and pure, his learning soprofound and vast, that several Church Fathers were his secret disciples.Clemens Alexandrinus speaks very highly of him. Plotinus, the \"St. John\" ofAmmonius, was also a man universally respected and esteemed, and of the mostprofound learning and integrity. When thirty-nine years of age hePage 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtaccompanied the Roman Emperor Gordian and his army to the East, to beinstructed by the sages of Bactria and India. He had a School of Philosophyin Rome. Porphyry, his disciple, whose real name was Malek (a HellenizedJew), collected all the writings of his master. Porphyry was himself a greatauthor, and gave an allegorical interpretation to some parts of Homer'swritings. The system of meditation the Philaletheians resorted to wasecstasy, a system akin to Indian Yoga practice. What is known of theEclectic School is due to Origen, Longinus, and Plotinus, the immediatedisciples of Ammonius.The chief aim of the Founders of the Eclectic Theosophical School was one ofthe three objects of its modern successor, the Theosophical Society, namely,to reconcile all religions, sects, and nations under a common system ofethics, based on eternal verities.Q. What have you to show that this is not an impossible dream; and that allthe world's religions are based on the one and the same truth?A. Their comparative study and analysis. The \"Wisdom-Religion\" was one inantiquity; and the sameness of primitive religious philosophy is proven tous by the identical doctrines taught to the Initiates during the mysteries,an institution once universally diffused.All the old worships indicate the existence of a single Theosophy anteriorto them. The key that is to open one must open all; otherwise it cannot bethe right key.  -oOo-The Policy of the Theosophical SocietyQ. In the days of Ammonius there were several ancient great religions, andnumerous were the sects in Egypt and Palestine alone. How could he reconcilethem?A. By doing that which we again try to do now. The Neo-Platonists were alarge body, and belonged to various religious philosophies; so do ourTheosophists.It was under Philadelphus that Judaism established itself in Alexandria, andforthwith the Hellenic teachers became the dangerous rivals of the Collegeof Rabbis of Babylon. As the author of The Eclectic Philosophy verypertinently remarks:The Buddhist, Vedantic, and Magian systems were expounded along with thephilosophies of Greece at that period. It was not wonderful that thoughtfulmen supposed that the strife of words ought to cease, and considered itpossible to extract one harmonious system from these various teachings ...Panaetius, Athenagoras, and Clement were thoroughly instructed in Platonicphilosophy, and comprehended its essential unity with the Oriental systems.In those days, the Jew Aristobulus affirmed that the ethics of Aristotlerepresented the esoteric teachings of the Law of Moses; Philo Judaeusendeavored to reconcile the Pentateuch with the Pythagorean and Platonicphilosophy; and Josephus proved that the Essenes of Carmel were simply thecopyists and followers of the Egyptian Therapeutae (the healers). So it isin our day. We can show the line of descent of every Christian religion, asof every, even the smallest, sect. The latter are the minor twigs or shootsgrown on the larger branches; but shoots and branches spring from the sametrunk-the wisdom-religion. To prove this was the aim of Ammonius, whoendeavored to induce Gentiles and Christians, Jews and Idolaters, to layaside their contention and strife, remembering only that they were all inpossession of the same truth under various vestments, and were all thechildren of a common mother. This is the aim of Theosophy likewise.Page 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtSays Mosheim of Ammonius:Conceiving that not only the philosophers of Greece, but also all those ofthe different barbarian nations, were perfectly in unison with each otherwith regard to every essential point, he made it his business so to expoundthe thousand tenets of all these various sects as to show they had alloriginated from one and the same source, and tended all to one and the sameend.If the writer on Ammonius in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia knows what he istalking about, then he describes the modern Theosophists, their beliefs, andtheir work, for he says, speaking of the Theodidaktos:He adopted the doctrines which were received in Egypt (the esoteric werethose of India) concerning the Universe and the Deity, considered asconstituting one great whole; concerning the eternity of the world ... andestablished a system of moral discipline which allowed the people in generalto live according to the laws of their country and the dictates of nature,but required the wise to exalt their mind by contemplation.Q. What is your authority for saying this of the ancient Theosophists ofAlexandria?A. An almost countless number of well-known writers. Mosheim, one of them,says that:Ammonius taught that the religion of the multitude went hand-in-hand withphilosophy, and with her had shared the fate of being by degrees corruptedand obscured with mere human conceits, superstitions, and lies; that itought, therefore, to be brought back to its original purity by purging it ofthis dross and expounding it upon philosophical principles; and the wholeChrist had in view was to reinstate and restore to its primitive integritythe wisdom of the ancients; to reduce within bounds theuniversally-prevailing dominion of superstition; and in part to correct, andin part to exterminate the various errors that had found their way into thedifferent popular religions.This, again, is precisely what the modern Theosophists say. Only while thegreat Philaletheian was supported and helped in the policy he pursued by twoChurch Fathers, Clement and Athenagoras, by all the learned Rabbis of theSynagogue, the Academy and the Groves, and while he taught a common doctrinefor all, we, his followers on the same line, receive no recognition, but, onthe contrary, are abused and persecuted. People 1,500 years ago are thusshown to have been more tolerant than they are in this enlightened century.Q. Was he encouraged and supported by the Church because, notwithstandinghis heresies, Ammonius taught Christianity and was a Christian?A. Not at all. He was born a Christian, but never accepted ChurchChristianity. As said of him by the same writer:He had but to propound his instructions according to the ancient pillars ofHermes, which Plato and Pythagoras knew before, and from them constitutedtheir philosophy. Finding the same in the prologue of the Gospel accordingto St. John, he very properly supposed that the purpose of Jesus was torestore the great doctrine of wisdom in its primitive integrity. Thenarratives of the Bible and the stories of the gods he considered to beallegories illustrative of the truth, or else fables to be rejected. As saysthe Edinburgh Encyclopedia:Moreover, he acknowledged that Jesus Christ was an excellent man and the\"friend of God,\" but alleged that it was not his design entirely to abolishthe worship of demons (gods), and that his only intention was to purify thePage 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtancient religion.  -oOo-The Wisdom-Religion, Esoteric in All AgesQ. Since Ammonius never committed anything to writing, how can one feel surethat such were his teachings?A. Neither did Buddha, Pythagoras, Confucius, Orpheus, Socrates, or evenJesus, leave behind them any writings. Yet most of these are historicalpersonages, and their teachings have all survived. The disciples of Ammonius(among whom Origen and Herennius) wrote treatises and explained his ethics.Certainly the latter are as historical, if not more so, than the Apostolicwritings. Moreover, his pupils-Origen, Plotinus, and Longinus (counselor ofthe famous Queen Zenobia)-have all left voluminous records of thePhilaletheian System-so far, at all events, as their public profession offaith was known, for the school was divided into exoteric and esotericteachings.Q. How have the latter tenets reached our day, since you hold that what isproperly called the wisdom-religion was esoteric?A. The wisdom-religion was ever one, and being the last word of possiblehuman knowledge, was, therefore, carefully preserved. It preceded by longages the Alexandrian Theosophists, reached the modern, and will surviveevery other religion and philosophy.Q. Where and by whom was it so preserved?A. Among Initiates of every country; among profound seekers aftertruth-their disciples; and in those parts of the world where such topicshave always been most valued and pursued: in India, Central Asia, andPersia.Q. Can you give me some proofs of its esotericism?A. The best proof you can have of the fact is that every ancient religious,or rather philosophical, cult consisted of an esoteric or secret teaching,and an exoteric (outward public) worship. Furthermore, it is a well-knownfact that the mysteries of the ancients comprised with every nation the\"greater\" (secret) and \"Lesser\" (public) mysteries-e.g., in the celebratedsolemnities called the Eleusinia, in Greece. From the Hierophants ofSamothrace, Egypt, and the initiated Brahmins of the India of old, down tothe later Hebrew Rabbis, all preserved, for fear of profanation, their realbona fide beliefs secret. The Jewish Rabbis called their secular religiousseries the Merkabah (the exterior body), \"the vehicle,\" or, the coveringwhich contains the hidden soul-i.e., their highest secret knowledge. Not oneof the ancient nations ever imparted through its priests its realphilosophical secrets to the masses, but allotted to the latter only thehusks. Northern Buddhism has its \"greater\" and its \"lesser\" vehicle, knownas the Mahayana, the esoteric, and the Hinayana, the exoteric, Schools. Norcan you blame them for such secrecy; for surely you would not think offeeding your flock of sheep on learned dissertations on botany instead of ongrass? Pythagoras called his Gnosis \"the knowledge of things that are,\" or[translit.Greek] \"he gnosis ton onton\" and preserved that knowledge for hispledged disciples only: for those who could digest such mental food and feelsatisfied; and he pledged them to silence and secrecy. Occult alphabets andsecret ciphers are the development of the old Egyptian hieratic writings,the secret of which was, in the days of old, in the possession only of theHierogrammatists, or initiated Egyptian priests. Ammonius Saccas, as hisbiographers tell us, bound his pupils by oath not to divulge his higherdoctrines except to those who had already been instructed in preliminaryknowledge, and who were also bound by a pledge. Finally, do we not find thePage 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtsame even in early Christianity, among the Gnostics, and even in theteachings of Christ? Did he not speak to the multitudes in parables whichhad a two-fold meaning, and explain his reasons only to his disciples? Hesays:To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but untothem that are without, all these things are done in parablesThe Essenes of Judea and Carmel made similar distinctions, dividing theiradherents into neophytes, brethren, and the perfect, or those initiated.Examples might be brought from every country to this effect.Q. Can you attain the \"Secret Wisdom\" simply by study? Encyclopedias defineTheosophy pretty much as Webster's Dictionary does, i.e., as... supposed intercourse with God and superior spirits, and consequentattainment of superhuman knowledge by physical means and chemical processes.Is this so?A. I think not. Nor is there any lexicographer capable of explaining,whether to himself or others, how superhuman knowledge can be attained byphysical or chemical processes. Had Webster said \"by metaphysical andalchemical processes,\" the definition would be approximately correct: as itis, it is absurd. Ancient Theosophists claimed, and so do the modern, thatthe infinite cannot be known by the finite-i.e., sensed by the finiteSelf-but that the divine essence could be communicated to the higherSpiritual Self in a state of ecstasy. This condition can hardly be attained,like hypnotism, by \"physical and chemical means.\"Q. What is your explanation of it?A. Real ecstasy was defined by Plotinus as \"the liberation of the mind fromits finite consciousness, becoming one and identified with the infinite.\"This is the highest condition, says Professor Wilder, but not one ofpermanent duration, and it is reached only by the very, very few. It is,indeed, identical with that state which is known in India as Samadhi. Thelatter is practiced by the Yogis, who facilitate it physically by thegreatest abstinence in food and drink, and mentally by an incessant endeavorto purify and elevate the mind. Meditation is silent and unuttered prayer,or, as Plato expressed it,... the ardent turning of the soul toward the divine; not to ask anyparticular good (as in the common meaning of prayer), but for gooditself-for the universal Supreme Good ...-of which we are a part on earth, and out of the essence of which we haveall emerged. Therefore, adds Plato,Remain silent in the presence of the divine ones, till they remove theclouds from thy eyes and enable thee to see by the light which issues fromthemselves, not what appears as good to thee, but what is intrinsicallygood.This is what the scholarly author of The Eclectic Philosophy, ProfessorAlexander Wilder, F.T.S., describes as \"spiritual photography\":The soul is the camera in which facts and events, future, past, and present,are alike fixed; and the mind becomes conscious of them. Beyond our everydayworld of limits all is one day or state-the past and future comprised in thepresent. ... Death is the last ecstasis on earth. Then the soul is freed fromthe constraint of the body, and its nobler part is united to higher natureand becomes partaker in the wisdom and foreknowledge of the higher beings.Page 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtReal Theosophy is, for the mystics, that state which Apollonius of Tyana wasmade to describe thus:I can see the present and the future as in a clear mirror. The sage need notwait for the vapors of the earth and the corruption of the air to foreseeevents ... The theoi, or gods, see the future; common men the present, sagesthat which is about to take place.\"The Theosophy of the Sages\" he speaks of is well expressed in theassertion, \"The Kingdom of God is within us.\"Q. Theosophy, then, is not, as held by some, a newly devised scheme?A. Only ignorant people can thus refer to it. It is as old as the world, inits teachings and ethics, if not in name, as it is also the broadest andmost catholic system among all.Q. How comes it, then, that Theosophy has remained so unknown to the nationsof the Western Hemisphere? Why should it have been a sealed book to racesconfessedly the most cultured and advanced?A. We believe there were nations as cultured in days of old and certainlymore spiritually \"advanced\" than we are. But there are several reasons forthis willing ignorance. One of them was given by St. Paul to the culturedAthenians-a loss, for long centuries, of real spiritual insight, and eveninterest, owing to their too great devotion to things of sense and theirlong slavery to the dead letter of dogma and ritualism. But the strongestreason for it lies in the fact that real Theosophy has ever been keptsecret.Q. You have brought forward proofs that such secrecy has existed; but whatwas the real cause for it?A. The causes for it were:1. The perversity of average human nature and its selfishness, alwaystending to the gratification of personal desires to the detriment ofneighbors arid next of kin. Such people could never be entrusted with divinesecrets.2. Their unreliability to keep the sacred and divine knowledge fromdesecration. It is the latter that led to the perversion of the most sublimetruths and symbols, and to the gradual transformation of things spiritualinto anthropomorphic, concrete, and gross imagery-in other words, to thedwarfing of the god-idea and to idolatry.  -oOo-Theosophy is Not BuddhismQ. You are often spoken of as \"Esoteric Buddhists.\" Are you then allfollowers of Gautama Buddha?A. No more than musicians are all followers of Wagner. Some of us areBuddhists by religion; yet there are far more Hindus and Brahmins thanBuddhists among us, and more Christian-born Europeans and Americans thanconverted Buddhists. The mistake has arisen from a misunderstanding of thereal meaning of the title of Mr. Sinnett's excellent work, EsotericBuddhism, which last word ought to have been spelt with one, instead of two,d's, as then Budhism would have meant what it was intended for, merely\"Wisdom-ism\" (Bodha, bodhi, \"intelligence,\" \"wisdom\") instead of Buddhism,Gautama's religious philosophy. Theosophy, as already said, is thewisdom-religion.Page 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. What is the difference between Buddhism, the religion founded by thePrince of Kapilavastu, and Budhism, the \"Wisdomism\" which you say issynonymous with Theosophy?A. Just the same difference as there is between the secret teachings ofChrist, which are called \"the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,\" and thelater ritualism and dogmatic theology of the Churches and Sects. Buddhameans the \"Enlightened\" by Bodha, or understanding, Wisdom. This has passedroot and branch into the esoteric teachings that Gautama imparted to hischosen Arhats only.Q. But some Orientalists deny that Buddha ever taught any esoteric doctrineat all?A. They may as well deny that Nature has any hidden secrets for the men ofscience. Further on I will prove it by Buddha's conversation with hisdisciple Ananda. His esoteric teachings were simply the Gupta-Vidya (secretknowledge) of the ancient Brahmins, the key to which their modern successorshave, with few exceptions, completely lost. And this Vidya has passed intowhat is now known as the inner teachings of the Mahayana school of NorthernBuddhism. Those who deny it are simply ignorant pretenders to Orientalism. Iadvise you to read the Rev. Mr. Edkin's Chinese Buddhism-especially thechapters on the Exoteric and Esoteric schools and teachings-and then comparethe testimony of the whole ancient world upon the subject.Q. But are not the ethics of Theosophy identical with those taught byBuddha?A. Certainly, because these ethics are the soul of the Wisdom-Religion, andwere once the common property of the initiates of all nations. But Buddhawas the first to embody these lofty ethics in his public teachings, and tomake them the foundation and the very essence of his public system. It isherein that lies the immense difference between exoteric Buddhism and everyother religion. For while in other religions ritualism and dogma hold thefirst and most important place, in Buddhism it is the ethics which havealways been the most insisted upon. This accounts for the resemblance,amounting almost to identity, between the ethics of Theosophy and those ofthe religion of Buddha.Q. Are there any great points of difference?A. One great distinction between Theosophy and exoteric Buddhism is that thelatter, represented by the Southern Church, entirely denies (a) theexistence of any Deity, and (b) any conscious postmortem life, or even anyself-conscious surviving individuality in man. Such at least is the teachingof the Siamese sect, now considered as the purest form of exoteric Buddhism.And it is so, if we refer only to Buddha's public teachings; the reason forsuch reticence on his part I will give further on. But the schools of theNorthern Buddhist Church, established in those countries to which hisinitiated Arhats retired after the Master's death, teach all that is nowcalled Theosophical doctrines, because they form part of the knowledge ofthe initiates-thus proving how the truth has been sacrificed to thedead-letter by the too-zealous orthodoxy of Southern Buddhism. But how muchgrander and more noble, more philosophical and scientific, even in itsdead-letter, is this teaching than that of any other Church or religion. YetTheosophy is not Buddhism.Exoteric and Esoteric Theosophy What the Modern Theosophical Society is NotQ. Your doctrines, then, are not a revival of Buddhism, nor are theyentirely copied from the Neo-Platonic Theosophy?Page 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. They are not. But to these questions I cannot give you a better answerthan by quoting from a paper read on \"Theosophy\" by Dr. J.D. Buck, F.T.S.,No living Theosophist has better expressed and understood the real essenceof Theosophy than our honored friend Dr. Buck:The Theosophical Society was organized for the purpose of promulgating theTheosophical doctrines, and for the promotion of the Theosophic life. Thepresent Theosophical Society is not the first of its kind. I have a volumeentitled: Theosophical Transactions of the Philadelphian Society, publishedin London in 1697; and another with the following title:Introduction to Theosophy, or the Science of the Mystery of Christ; that is,of Deity, Nature, and Creature, embracing the philosophy of all the workingpowers of life, magical and spiritual, ant forming a practical guide to themost sublime purity, sanctity, and evangelical perfection; also to theattainment of divine vision, and the holy angelic arts, potencies, and otherprerogatives of the regeneration.-published in London in 1855. The following is the dedication of thisvolume:To the students of Universities, Colleges, and schools of Christendom: ToProfessors of Metaphysical, Mechanical, and Natural Science in all itsforms: To men and women of Education generally, of fundamental orthodoxfaith: To Deists, Arians, Unitarians, Swedenborgians, and other defectiveand ungrounded creeds, rationalists, and skeptics of every kind: Tojust-minded and enlightened Mohammedans, Jews, and orientalPatriarch-religionists: but especially to the gospel minister andmissionary, whether to the barbaric or intellectual peoples, thisintroduction to Theosophy, or the science of the ground and mystery of allthings, is most humbly and affectionately dedicated.In the following year (1856) another volume was issued, royal octavo, of 600pages, diamond type, of Theosophical Miscellanies. Of the last-named work500 copies only were issued, for gratuitous distribution to Libraries andUniversities. These earlier movements, of which there were many, originatedwithin the Church, with persons of great piety and earnestness, and ofunblemished character; and all of these writings were in orthodox form,usingthe Christian expressions, and, like the writings of the eminent ChurchmanWilliam Law, would only be distinguished by the ordinary reader for theirgreat earnestness and piety. These were one and all but attempts to deriveand explain the deeper meanings and original import of the ChristianScriptures, and to illustrate and unfold the Theosophic life. These workswere soon forgotten, and are now generally unknown. They sought to reformthe clergy and revive genuine piety, and were never welcomed. That one word,Heresy, was sufficient to bury them in the limbo of all such Utopias. At thetime of the Reformation John Reuchlin made a similar attempt with the sameresult, though he was the intimate and trusted friend of Luther. Orthodoxynever desired to be informed and enlightened. These reformers were informed,as was Paul by Festus, that too much learning had made them mad, and that itwould be dangerous to go farther. Passing by the verbiage, which was partlya matter of habit and education with these writers, and partly due toreligious restraint through secular power, and coming to the core of thematter, these writings were Theosophical in the strictest sense, and pertainsolely to man's knowledge of his own nature and the higher life of the soul.The present Theosophical Movement has sometimes been declared to be anPage 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtattempt to convert Christendom to Buddhism, which means simply that the wordHeresy has lost its terrors and relinquished its power. Individuals in everyage have more or less clearly apprehended the Theosophical doctrines andwrought them into the fabric of their lives. These doctrines belongexclusively to no religion, and are confined to no society or time. They arethe birthright of every human soul. Such a thing as orthodoxy must bewrought out by each individual according to his nature and his needs, andaccording to his varying experience. This may explain why those who haveimagined Theosophy to be a new religion have hunted in vain for its creedand its ritual. Its creed is Loyalty to Truth, and its ritual \"To honorevery truth by use.\"How little this principle of Universal Brotherhood is understood by themasses of mankind, how seldom its transcendent importance is recognized, maybe seen in the diversity of opinion and fictitious interpretations regardingthe Theosophical Society. This Society was organized on this one principle,the essential Brotherhood of Man, as herein briefly outlined and imperfectlyset forth. It has been assailed as Buddhist and anti-Christian, as though itcould be both these together, when both Buddhism and Christianity, as setforth by their inspired founders, make brotherhood the one essential ofdoctrine and of life. Theosophy has been also regarded as something newunder the sun, or, at best as old mysticism masquerading under a new name.While it is true that many Societies founded upon, and united to support,the principles of altruism, or essential brotherhood, have borne variousnames, it is also true that many have also been called Theosophic, and withprinciples and aims as the present society bearing that name. With thesesocieties, one and all, the essential doctrine has been the same, and allelse has been incidental, though this does not obviate the fact that manypersons are attracted to the incidentals who overlook or ignore theessentials.No better or more explicit answer-by a man who is one of our most esteemedand earnest Theosophists-could be given to your questions.Q. Which system do you prefer or follow, in that case, besides Buddhistethics?A. None, and all. We hold to no religion, as to no philosophy in particular:we cull the good we find in each. But here, again, it must be stated that,like all other ancient systems, Theosophy is divided into Exoteric andEsoteric Sections.Q. What is the difference?A. The members of the Theosophical Society at large are free to professwhatever religion or philosophy they like, or none if they so prefer,provided they are in sympathy with, and ready to carry out one or more ofthe three objects of the Association. The Society is a philanthropic andscientific body for the propagation of the idea of brotherhood on practicalinstead of theoretical lines. The Fellows may be Christians or Muslims, Jewsor Parsees, Buddhists or Brahmins, Spiritualists or Materialists, it doesnot matter; but every member must be either a philanthropist, or a scholar,a searcher into ryan and other old literature, or a psychic student. Inshort, he has to help, if he can, in the carrying out of at least one of theobjects of the program. Otherwise he has no reason for becoming a \"Fellow.\"Such are the majority of the exoteric Society, composed of \"attached\" and\"unattached\" members. These may, or may not, become Theosophists de facto.Members they are, by virtue of their having joined the Society; but thelatter cannot make a Theosophist of one who has no sense for the divinefitness of things, or of him who understands Theosophy in his own-if theexpression may be used-sectarian and egotistic way. \"Handsome is, ashandsome does\" could be paraphrased in this case and be made to run:\"Theosophist is, who Theosophy does.\"Page 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txt  -oOo-Theosophists and Members of the T.S.Q. This applies to lay members, as I understand. And what of those whopursue the esoteric study of Theosophy; are they the real Theosophists?A. Not necessarily, until they have proven themselves to be such. They haveentered the inner group and pledged themselves to carry out, as strictly asthey can, the rules of the occult body. This is a difficult undertaking, asthe foremost rule of all is the entire renunciation of one'spersonality-i.e., a pledged member has to become a thorough altruist, neverto think of himself, and to forget his own vanity and pride in the thoughtof the good of his fellow-creatures, besides that of his fellow-brothers inthe esoteric circle. He has to live, if the esoteric instructions shallprofit him, a life of abstinence in everything, of self-denial and strictmorality, doing his duty by all men. The few real Theosophists in the T.S.are among these members.A. This does not imply that outside of the T.S. and the inner circle, thereare no Theosophists; for there are, and more than people know of; certainlyfar more than are found among the lay members of the T.S.Q. Then what is the good of joining the so-called Theosophical Society inthat case? Where is the incentive?A. None, except the advantage of getting esoteric instructions, the genuinedoctrines of the \"Wisdom-Religion,\" and if the real program is carried out,deriving much help from mutual aid and sympathy. Union is strength andharmony, and well-regulated simultaneous efforts produce wonders. This hasbeen the secret of all associations and communities since mankind existed.Q. But why could not a man of well-balanced mind and singleness of purpose,one, say, of indomitable energy and perseverance, become an Occultist andeven an Adept if he works alone?A. He may; but there are ten thousand chances against one that he will fail.For one reason out of many others, no books on Occultism or Theurgy exist inour day which give out the secrets of alchemy or medieval Theosophy in plainlanguage. All are symbolical or in parables; and as the key to these hasbeen lost for ages in the West, how can a man learn the correct meaning ofwhat he is reading and studying? Therein lies the greatest danger, one thatleads to unconscious black magic or the most helpless mediumship. He who hasnot an Initiate for a master had better leave the dangerous study alone.Look around you and observe. While two-thirds of civilized society ridiculethe mere notion that there is anything in Theosophy, Occultism,Spiritualism, or in the Cabala, the other third is composed of the mostheterogeneous and opposite elements. Some believe in the mystical, and evenin the supernatural (!), but each believes in his own way. Others will rushsingle-handed into the study of the Cabala, Psychism, Mesmerism,Spiritualism, or some form or another of Mysticism. Result: no two men thinkalike, no two are agreed upon any fundamental occult principles, though manyare those who claim for themselves the ultima thule of knowledge, and wouldmake outsiders believe that they are full-blown adepts. Not only is there noscientific and accurate knowledge of Occultism accessible in the West-noteven of true astrology, the only branch of Occultism which, in its exotericteachings, has definite laws and a definite system-but no one has any ideaof what real Occultism means. Some limit ancient wisdom to the Cabala andthe Jewish Zohar, which each interprets in his own way according to thedead-letter of the Rabbinical methods. Others regard Swedenborg or Boëhme asthe ultimate expressions of the highest wisdom; while others again see inmesmerism the great secret of ancient magic. One and all of those who puttheir theory into practice are rapidly drifting, through ignorance, intoblack magic. Happy are those who escape from it, as they have neither testPage 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtnor criterion by which they can distinguish between the true and the false.Q. Are we to understand that the inner group of the T.S. claims to learnwhat it does from real initiates or masters of esoteric wisdom?A. Not directly. The personal presence of such masters is not required.Suffice it if they give instructions to some of those who have studied undertheir guidance for years, and devoted their whole lives to their service.Then, in turn, these can give out the knowledge so imparted to others, whohad no such opportunity. A portion of the true sciences is better than amass of undigested and misunderstood learning. An ounce of gold is worth aton of dust.Q. But how is one to know whether the ounce is real gold or only acounterfeit?A. A tree is known by its fruit, a system by its results. When our opponentsare able to prove to us that any solitary student of Occultism throughoutthe ages has become a saintly adept like Ammonius Saccas, or even aPlotinus, or a Theurgist like Iamblichus, or achieved feats such as areclaimed to have been done by St. Germain, without any master to guide him,and all this without being a medium, a self-deluded psychic, or acharlatan-then shall we confess ourselves mistaken. But till then,Theosophists prefer to follow the proven natural law of the tradition of theSacred Science. There are mystics who have made great discoveries inchemistry and physical sciences, almost bordering on alchemy and Occultism;others who, by the sole aid of their genius, have rediscovered portions, ifnot the whole, of the lost alphabets of the \"Mystery language,\" and are,therefore, able to read correctly Hebrew scrolls; others still, who, beingseers, have caught wonderful glimpses of the hidden secrets of Nature. Butall these are specialists. One is a theoretical inventor, another a Hebrew,i.e., a Sectarian Cabalist, a third a Swedenborg of modern times, denyingall and everything outside of his own particular science or religion. Notone of them can boast of having produced a universal or even a nationalbenefit thereby, not even to himself. With the exception of a few healers-ofthat class which the Royal College of Physicians or Surgeons would callquacks-none have helped with their science Humanity, nor even a number ofmen of the same community. Where are the Chaldeans of old, those who wroughtmarvelous cures, \"not by charms but by simples\"? Where is an Apollonius ofTyana, who healed the sick and raised the dead under any climate andcircumstances? We know some specialists of the former class in Europe, butnone of the latter-except in Asia, where the secret of the Yogi, \"to live indeath,\" is still preserved.Q. Is the production of such healing adepts the aim of Theosophy?A. Its aims are several; but the most important of all are those which arelikely to lead to the relief of human suffering under any or every form,moral as well as physical. And we believe the former to be far moreimportant than the latter. Theosophy has to inculcate ethics; it has topurify the soul, if it would relieve the physical body, whose ailments, savecases of accidents, are all hereditary. It is not by studying Occultism forselfish ends, for the gratification of one's personal ambition, pride, orvanity, that one can ever reach the true goal: that of helping sufferingmankind. Nor is it by studying one single branch of the esoteric philosophythat a man becomes an Occultist, but by studying, if not mastering, themall.Q. Is help, then, to reach this most important aim, given only to those whostudy the esoteric sciences?A. Not at all. Every lay member is entitled to general instruction if heonly wants it; but few are willing to become what is called \"workingmembers,\" and most prefer to remain the drones of Theosophy. Let it bePage 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtunderstood that private research is encouraged in the T.S., provided it doesnot infringe the limit which separates the exoteric from the esoteric, theblind from the conscious magic.  -oOo-The Difference Between Theosophy and OccultismQ. You speak of Theosophy and Occultism; are they identical?A. By no means. A man may be a very good Theosophist indeed, whether in oroutside of the Society, without being in any way an Occultist. But no onecan be a true Occultist without being a real Theosophist; otherwise he issimply a black magician, whether conscious or unconscious.Q. What do you mean?A. I have said already that a true Theosophist must put in practice theloftiest moral ideal, must strive to realize his unity with the whole ofhumanity, and work ceaselessly for others. Now, if an Occultist does not doall this, he must act selfishly for his own personal benefit; and if he hasacquired more practical power than other ordinary men, he becomes forthwitha far more dangerous enemy to the world and those around him than theaverage mortal. This is clear.Q. Then is an Occultist simply a man who possesses more power than otherpeople?A. Far more-if he is a practical and really learned Occultist, and not oneonly in name. Occult sciences are not, as described in Encyclopedias,... those imaginary sciences of the Middle Ages which related to the supposedaction or influence of Occult qualities or supernatural powers, as alchemy,magic, necromancy, and astrology ...-for they are real, actual, and very dangerous sciences. They teach thesecret potency of things in Nature, developing and cultivating the hiddenpowers \"latent in man,\" thus giving him tremendous advantages over moreignorant mortals. Hypnotism, now become so common and a subject of seriousscientific inquiry, is a good instance in point. Hypnotic power has beendiscovered almost by accident, the way to it having been prepared bymesmerism; and now an able hypnotist can do almost anything with it, fromforcing a man, unconsciously to himself, to play the fool, to making himcommit a crime-often by proxy for the hypnotist, and for the benefit of thelatter. Is not this a terrible power if left in the hands of unscrupulouspersons? And please to remember that this is only one of the minor branchesof Occultism.Q. But are not all these Occult sciences, magic, and sorcery, considered bythe most cultured and learned people as relics of ancient ignorance andsuperstition?A. Let me remind you that this remark of yours cuts both ways. The \"mostcultured and learned\" among you regard also Christianity and every otherreligion as a relic of ignorance and superstition. People begin to believenow, at any rate, in hypnotism, and some-even of the most cultured-inTheosophy and phenomena. But who among them, except preachers and blindfanatics, will confess to a belief in Biblical miracles? And this is wherethe point of difference comes in. There are very good and pure Theosophistswho may believe in the supernatural, divine miracles included, but noOccultist will do so. For an Occultist practices scientific Theosophy, basedon accurate knowledge of Nature's secret workings; but a Theosophist,practicing the powers called abnormal, minus the light of Occultism, willsimply tend toward a dangerous form of mediumship, because, although holdingPage 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtto Theosophy and its highest conceivable code of ethics, he practices it inthe dark, on sincere but blind faith. Anyone, Theosophist or Spiritualist,who attempts to cultivate one of the branches of Occult science-e.g.,Hypnotism, Mesmerism, or even the secrets of producing physical phenomena,etc.-without the knowledge of the philosophic rationale of those powers, islike a rudderless boat launched on a stormy ocean.  -oOo-The Difference Between Theosophy and SpiritualismQ. But do you not believe in Spiritualism?A. If by \"Spiritualism\" you mean the explanation which Spiritualists give ofsome abnormal phenomena, then decidedly we do not. They maintain that thesemanifestations are all produced by the \"spirits\" of departed mortals,generally their relatives, who return to earth, they say, to communicatewith those they have loved or to whom they are attached. We deny this pointblank. We assert that the spirits of the dead cannot return to earth-save inrare and exceptional cases, of which I may speak later; nor do theycommunicate with men except by entirely subjective means. That which doesappear objectively, is only the phantom of the ex-physical man. But inpsychic, and so to say, \"Spiritual\" Spiritualism, we do believe, mostdecidedly.Q. Do you reject the phenomena also?A. Assuredly not-save cases of conscious fraud.Q. How do you account for them, then?A. In many ways. The causes of such manifestations are by no means so simpleas the Spiritualists would like to believe. Foremost of all, the deus exmachina of the so-called \"materializations\" is usually the astral body or\"double\" of the medium or of someone present. This astral body is also theproducer or operating force in the manifestations of slate-writing,\"Davenport\"-like manifestations, and so on.Q. You say usually-then what is it that produces the rest?A. That depends on the nature of the manifestations. Sometimes the astralremains, the Kamalokic \"shells\" of the vanished personalities that were; atother times, Elementals. Spirit is a word of manifold and wide significance.I really do not know what Spiritualists mean by the term; but what weunderstand them to claim is that the physical phenomena are produced by thereincarnating Ego, the Spiritual and immortal \"individuality.\" And thishypothesis we entirely reject. The Conscious Individuality of thedisembodied cannot materialize, nor can it return from its own mentalDevachanic sphere to the plane of terrestrial objectivity.Q. But many of the communications received from the \"spirits\" show not onlyintelligence, but a knowledge of facts not known to the medium, andsometimes even not consciously present to the mind of the investigator, orany of those who compose the audience.A. This does not necessarily prove that the intelligence and knowledge youspeak of belong to spirits, or emanate from disembodied souls. Somnambulistshave been known to compose music and poetry and to solve mathematicalproblems while in their trance state, without having ever learnt music ormathematics. Others, answered intelligently to questions put to them, andeven, in several cases, spoke languages, such as Hebrew and Latin, of whichthey were entirely ignorant when awake-all this in a state of profoundsleep. Will you, then, maintain that this was caused by \"spirits\"?Page 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. But how would you explain it?A. We assert that the divine spark in man being one and identical in itsessence with the Universal Spirit, our \"spiritual Self\" is practicallyomniscient, but that it cannot manifest its knowledge owing to theimpediments of matter. Now the more these impediments are removed, in otherwords, the more the physical body is paralyzed, as to its own independentactivity and consciousness, as in deep sleep or deep trance, or, again, inillness, the more fully can the inner Self manifest on this plane. This isour explanation of those truly wonderful phenomena of a higher order, inwhich undeniable intelligence and knowledge are exhibited. As to the lowerorder of manifestations, such as physical phenomena and the platitudes andcommon talk of the general \"spirit,\" to explain even the most important ofthe teachings we hold upon the subject would take up more space and timethan can be allotted to it at present. We have no desire to interfere withthe belief of the Spiritualists any more than with any other belief. Theresponsibility must fall on the believers in \"spirits.\" And at the presentmoment, while still convinced that the higher sort of manifestations occurthrough the disembodied souls, their leaders and the most learned andintelligent among the Spiritualists are the first to confess that not allthe phenomena are produced by spirits. Gradually they will come to recognizethe whole truth; but meanwhile we have no right nor desire to proselytizethem to our views. The less so, as in the cases of purely psychic andspiritual manifestations we believe in the intercommunication of the spiritof the living man with that of disembodied personalities.We say that in such cases it is not the spirits of the dead who descend onearth, but the spirits of the living that ascend to the pure spiritualSouls. In truth there is neither ascending nor descending, but a change ofstate or condition for the medium. The body of the latter becomingparalyzed, or \"entranced,\" the spiritual Ego is free from its trammels, andfinds itself on the same plane of consciousness with the disembodiedspirits. Hence, if there is any spiritual attraction between the two theycan communicate, as often occurs in dreams. The difference between amediumistic and a non-sensitive nature is this: the liberated spirit of amedium has the opportunity and facility of influencing the passive organs ofits entranced physical body, to make them act, speak, and write at its will.The Ego can make it repeat, echo-like, and in the human language, thethoughts and ideas of the disembodied entity, as well as its own. But thenon-receptive or non-sensitive organism of one who is very positive cannotbe so influenced. Hence, although there is hardly a human being whose Egodoes not hold free intercourse, during the sleep of his body, with thosewhom it loved and lost, yet, on account of the positiveness andnon-receptivity of its physical envelope and brain, no recollection, or avery dim, dream-like remembrance, lingers in the memory of the person onceawake.Q. This means that you reject the philosophy of Spiritualism in toto?A. If by \"philosophy\" you mean their crude theories, we do. But they have nophilosophy, in truth. Their best, their most intellectual and earnestdefenders say so. Their fundamental and only unimpeachable truth, namely,that phenomena occur through mediums controlled by invisible forces andintelligences-no one, except a blind materialist of the \"Huxley big toe\"school, will or can deny. With regard to their philosophy, however, let meread to you what the able editor of Light, than whom the Spiritualists willfind no wiser nor more devoted champion, says of them and their philosophy.This is what \"M.A. Oxon,\" one of the very few philosophical Spiritualists,writes, with respect to their lack of organization and blind bigotry:It is worthwhile to look steadily at this point, for it is of vital moment.We have an experience and a knowledge beside which all other knowledge iscomparatively insignificant. The ordinary Spiritualist waxes wroth if anyonePage 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtventures to impugn his assured knowledge of the future and his absolutecertainty of the life to come. Where other men have stretched forth feeblehands groping into the dark future, he walks boldly as one who has a chartand knows his way. Where other men have stopped short at a pious aspirationor have been content with a hereditary faith, it is his boast that he knowswhat they only believe, and that out of his rich stores he can supplementthe fading faiths built only upon hope. He is magnificent in his dealingswith man's most cherished expectations. He seems to say:You hope for that which I can demonstrate. You have accepted a traditionalbelief in what I can experimentally prove according to the strictestscientific method. The old beliefs are fading; come out from them and beseparate. They contain as much falsehood as truth. Only by building on asure foundation of demonstrated fact can your superstructure be stable. Allround you old faiths are toppling. Avoid the crash and get you out.When one comes to deal with this magnificent person in a practical way, whatis the result? Very curious and very disappointing. He is so sure of hisground that he takes no trouble to ascertain the interpretation which othersput upon his facts. The wisdom of the ages has concerned itself with theexplanation of what he rightly regards as proven; but he does not turn apassing glance on its researches. He does not even agree altogether with hisbrother Spiritualist. It is the story over again of the old Scotch body who,together with her husband, formed a \"kirk.\" They had exclusive keys toHeaven, or, rather, she had, for she was \"na certain aboot Jamie.\" So theinfinitely divided and subdivided and re-subdivided sects of Spiritualistsshake their heads, and are \"na certain aboot\" one another. Again, thecollective experience of mankind is solid and unvarying on this point thatunion is strength, and disunion a source of weakness and failure. Shoulderto shoulder, drilled and disciplined, a rabble becomes an army, each man amatch for a hundred of the untrained men that may be brought against it.Organization in every department of man's work means success, saving of timeand labor, profit and development. Want of method, want of plan, haphazardwork, fitful energy, undisciplined effort-these mean bungling failure. Thevoice of humanity attests the truth. Does the Spiritualist accept theverdict and act on the conclusion? Verily, no. He refuses to organize. He isa law unto himself, and a thorn in the side of his neighbors.Q. I was told that the Theosophical Society was originally founded to crushSpiritualism and belief in the survival of the individuality in man?A. You are misinformed. Our beliefs are all founded on that immortalindividuality. But then, like so many others, you confuse personality withindividuality. Your Western psychologists do not seem to have establishedany clear distinction between the two. Yet it is precisely that differencewhich gives the keynote to the understanding of Eastern philosophy, andwhich lies at the root of the divergence between the Theosophical andSpiritualistic teachings. And though it may draw upon us still more thehostility of some Spiritualists, yet I must state here that it is Theosophywhich is the true and unalloyed Spiritualism, while the modern scheme ofthat name is, as now practiced by the masses, simply transcendentalmaterialism.Q. Please explain your idea more clearly.A. What I mean is that though our teachings insist upon the identity ofspirit and matter, and though we say that spirit is potential matter, andmatter simply crystallized spirit (e.g., as ice is solidified steam), yetsince the original and eternal condition of all is not spirit butmeta-spirit, so to speak, we maintain that the term spirit can only beapplied to the true individuality.Q. But what is the distinction between this \"true individuality\" and the \"I\"or \"Ego\" of which we are all conscious?Page 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. Before I can answer you, we must argue upon what you mean by \"I\" or\"Ego.\" We distinguish between the simple fact of self-consciousness, thesimple feeling that \"I am I,\" and the complex thought that \"I am Mr. Smith\"or \"Mrs. Brown.\" Believing as we do in a series of births for the same Ego,or reincarnation, this distinction is the fundamental pivot of the wholeidea. You see \"Mr. Smith\" really means a long series of daily experiencesstrung together by the thread of memory, and forming what Mr. Smith calls\"himself.\" But none of these \"experiences\" are really the \"I\" or the Ego,nor do they give \"Mr. Smith\" the feeling that he is himself, for he forgetsthe greater part of his daily experiences, and they produce the feeling ofEgoity in him only while they last. We Theosophists, therefore, distinguishbetween this bundle of \"experiences,\" which we call the false (because sofinite and evanescent) personality, and that element in man to which thefeeling of \"I am I\" is due. It is this \"I am I\" which we call the trueindividuality; and we say that this \"Ego\" or individuality plays, like anactor, many parts on the stage of life. Let us call every new life on earthof the same Ego a night on the stage of a theater. One night the actor, or\"Ego,\" appears as \"Macbeth,\" the next as \"Shylock,\" the third as \"Romeo,\"the fourth as \"Hamlet\" or \"King Lear,\" and so on, until he has run throughthe whole cycle of incarnations. The Ego begins his life-pilgrimage as asprite, an \"Ariel,\" or a \"Puck\"; he plays the part of a super, is a soldier,a servant, one of the chorus; rises then to \"speaking parts,\" plays leadingroles, interspersed with insignificant parts, till he finally retires fromthe stage as \"Prospero,\" the magician.Q. I understand. You say, then, that this true Ego cannot return to earthafter death. But surely the actor is at liberty, if he has preserved thesense of his individuality, to return if he likes to the scene of his formeractions?A. We say not, simply because such a return to earth would be incompatiblewith any state of unalloyed bliss after death, as I am prepared to prove. Wesay that man suffers so much unmerited misery during his life, through thefault of others with whom he is associated, or because of his environment,that he is surely entitled to perfect rest and quiet, if not bliss, beforetaking up again the burden of life. However, we can discuss this in detaillater.  -oOo-Why is Theosophy Accepted?Q. I understand to a certain extent; but I see that your teachings are farmore complicated and metaphysical than either Spiritualism or currentreligious thought. Can you tell me, then, what has caused this system ofTheosophy which you support to arouse so much interest and so much animosityat the same time?A. There are several reasons for it, I believe; among other causes that maybe mentioned is:1. The great reaction from the crassly materialistic theories now prevalentamong scientific teachers.2. General dissatisfaction with the artificial theology of the variousChristian Churches, and the number of daily increasing and conflictingsects.3. An ever-growing perception of the fact that the creeds which are soobviously self-and mutually-contradictory cannot be true, and that claimswhich are unverified cannot be real. This natural distrust of conventionalreligions is only strengthened by their complete failure to preserve moralsand to purify society and the masses.Page 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txt4. A conviction on the part of many, and knowledge by a few, that there mustbe somewhere a philosophical and religious system which shall be scientificand not merely speculative.5. A belief, perhaps, that such a system must be sought for in teachings farantedating any modern faith.Q. But how did this system come to be put forward just now?A. Just because the time was found to be ripe, which fact is shown by thedetermined effort of so many earnest students to reach the truth, atwhatever cost and wherever it may be concealed. Seeing this, its custodianspermitted that some portions at least of that truth should be proclaimed.Had the formation of the Theosophical Society been postponed a few yearslonger, one half of the civilized nations would have become by this timerank materialists, and the other half anthropomorphists and phenomenalists.Q. Are we to regard Theosophy in any way as a revelation?A. In no way whatever-not even in the sense of a new and direct disclosurefrom some higher, supernatural, or, at least, superhuman beings; but only inthe sense of an \"unveiling\" of old, very old, truths to minds hithertoignorant of them, ignorant even of the existence and preservation of anysuch archaic knowledge.It has become \"fashionable,\" especially of late, to deride the notion thatthere ever was, in the mysteries of great and civilized peoples, such as theEgyptians, Greeks, or Romans, anything but priestly imposture. Even theRosicrucians were no better than half lunatics, half knaves. Numerous bookshave been written on them; and tyros, who had hardly heard the name a fewyears before, sallied out as profound critics and Gnostics on the subject ofalchemy, the fire-philosophers, and mysticism in general. Yet a long seriesof the Hierophants of Egypt, India, Chaldea, and Arabia are known, alongwith the greatest philosophers and sages of Greece and the West, to haveincluded under the designation of wisdom and divine science all knowledge,for they considered the base and origin of every art and science asessentially divine. Plato regarded the mysteries as most sacred, and ClemensAlexandrinus, who had been himself initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries,has declared \"that the doctrines taught therein contained in them the end ofall human knowledge.\" Were Plato and Clemens two knaves or two fools, wewonder, or-both?Q. You spoke of \"Persecution.\" If truth is as represented by Theosophy, whyhas it met with such opposition, and with no general acceptance?A. For many and various reasons again, one of which is the hatred felt bymen for \"innovations,\" as they call them. Selfishness is essentiallyconservative, and hates being disturbed. It prefers an easy-going,unexacting lie to the greatest truth, if the latter requires the sacrificeof one's smallest comfort. The power of mental inertia is great in anythingthat does not promise immediate benefit and reward. Our age is preeminentlyunspiritual and matter of fact. Moreover, there is the unfamiliar characterof Theosophic teachings; the highly abstruse nature of the doctrines, someof which contradict flatly many of the human vagaries cherished bysectarians, which have eaten into the very core of popular beliefs. If weadd to this the personal efforts and great purity of life exacted of thosewho would become the disciples of the inner circle, and the very limitedclass to which an entirely unselfish code appeals, it will be easy toperceive the reason why Theosophy is doomed to such slow, uphill work. It isessentially the philosophy of those who suffer, and have lost all hope ofbeing helped out of the mire of life by any other means. Moreover, thehistory of any system of belief or morals, newly introduced into a foreignsoil, shows that its beginnings were impeded by every obstacle thatPage 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtobscurantism and selfishness could suggest. \"The crown of the innovator is acrown of thorns\" indeed! No pulling down of old, worm-eaten buildings can beaccomplished without some danger.Q. All this refers rather to the ethics and philosophy of the T.S. Can yougive me a general idea of the Society itself, its objects and statutes?A. This was never made secret. Ask, and you shall receive accurate answers.Q. But I heard that you were bound by pledges?A. Only in the Arcane or \"Esoteric\" Section.Q. And also, that some members after leaving did not regard themselves boundby them. Are they right?A. This shows that their idea of honor is an imperfect one. How can they beright? As well said in The Path, our theosophical organ at New York,treating of such a case:Suppose that a soldier is tried for infringement of oath and discipline, andis dismissed from the service. In his rage at the justice he has calleddown, and of whose penalties he was distinctly forewarned, the soldier turnsto the enemy with false information-a spy and traitor-as a revenge upon hisformer Chief, and claims that his punishment has released him from his oathof loyalty to a cause.Is he justified, think you? Don't you think he deserves being called adishonorable man, a coward?Q. I believe so; but some think otherwise.A. So much the worse for them. But we will talk on this subject later, ifyou please.The Working System of the T.S. *1)  The Objects of the SocietyQ. What are the objects of the \"Theosophical Society\"?A. They are three, and have been so from the beginning.1. To form the nucleus of a Universal Brotherhood of Humanity withoutdistinction of race, color, or creed.2. To promote the study of Aryan *2) and other Scriptures, of the World'sreligions and sciences, and to vindicate the importance of old Asiaticliterature, namely, of the Brahmanical, Buddhist, and Zoroastrianphilosophies.3. To investigate the hidden mysteries of Nature under every aspectpossible, and the psychic and spiritual powers latent in man especially.These are, broadly stated, the three chief objects of the TheosophicalSociety.*1) See also appendix at the end of this file*2) H.P.B. means the original Indo-Germanic race from Northern India (seeH.P.B., The Theosophical Glossary, London, 1892and also the glossary at the end of this file)Page 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. Can you give me some more detailed information upon these?A. We may divide each of the three objects into as many explanatory clausesas may be found necessary.Q. Then let us begin with the first. What means would you resort to, inorder to promote such a feeling of brotherhood among races that are known tobe of the most diversified religions, customs, beliefs, and modes ofthought?A. Allow me to add that which you seem unwilling to express. Of course weknow that with the exception of two remnants of races-the Parsees and theJews-every nation is divided, not merely against all other nations, but evenagainst itself. This is found most prominently among the so-called civilizedChristian nations. Hence your wonder, and the reason why our first objectappears to you a Utopia. Is it not so?Q. Well, yes; but what have you to say against it?A. Nothing against the fact; but much about the necessity of removing thecauses which make Universal Brotherhood a Utopia at present.Q. What are, in your view, these causes?A. First and foremost, the natural selfishness of human nature. Thisselfishness, instead of being eradicated, is daily strengthened andstimulated into a ferocious and irresistible feeling by the presentreligious education, which tends not only to encourage, but positively tojustify it. People's ideas about right and wrong have been entirelyperverted by the literal acceptance of the Jewish Bible. All theunselfishness of the altruistic teachings of Jesus has become merely atheoretical subject for pulpit oratory; while the precepts of practicalselfishness taught in the Mosaic Bible, against which Christ so vainlypreached, have become ingrained into the innermost life of the Westernnations. \"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\" has come to be thefirst maxim of your law. Now, I state openly and fearlessly, that theperversity of this doctrine and of so many others Theosophy alone caneradicate.  -oOo-The Common Origin of ManQ. How?A. Simply by demonstrating on logical, philosophical, metaphysical, and evenscientific grounds that: (a) All men have spiritually and physically thesame origin, which is the fundamental teaching of Theosophy. (b) As mankindis essentially of one and the same essence, and that essence isone-infinite, uncreate, and eternal, whether we call it God orNature-nothing, therefore, can affect one nation or one man withoutaffecting all other nations and all other men. This is as certain and asobvious as that a stone thrown into a pond will, sooner or later, set inmotion every single drop of water therein.Q. But this is not the teaching of Christ, but rather a pantheistic notion.A. That is where your mistake lies. It is purely Christian, although notJudaic, and therefore, perhaps, your Biblical nations prefer to ignore it.Q. This is a wholesale and unjust accusation. Where are your proofs for sucha statement?A. They are ready at hand. Christ is alleged to have said: \"Love each other\"Page 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtand \"Love your enemies;\" for... if ye love them (only) which love you, what reward (or merit) have ye? Donot even the publicans the same? And if you salute your brethren only, whatdo ye more than others? Do not even publicans so?These are Christ's words. But Genesis says \"Cursed be Canaan, a servant ofservants shall he be unto his brethren.\" And, therefore, Christian butBiblical people prefer the law of Moses to Christ's law of love. They baseupon the Old Testament, which panders to all their passions, their laws ofconquest, annexation, and tyranny over races which they call inferior. Whatcrimes have been committed on the strength of this infernal (if taken in itsdead letter) passage in Genesis, history alone gives us an idea, howeverinadequate.At the close of the Middle Ages slavery, under the power of moral forces,had mainly disappeared from Europe; but two momentous events occurred whichoverbore the moral power working in European society and let loose a swarmof curses upon the earth such as mankind had scarcely ever known. One ofthese events was the first voyaging to a populated and barbarous coast wherehuman beings were a familiar article of traffic; and the other the discoveryof a new world, where mines of glittering wealth were open, provided laborcould be imported to work them. For four hundred years men and women andchildren were torn from all whom they knew and loved, and were sold on thecoast of Africa to foreign traders; they were chained below decks-the deadoften with the living-during the horrible \"middle passage,\" and, accordingto Bancroft, an impartial historian, two hundred and fifty thousand out ofthree and a quarter millions were thrown into the sea on that fatal passage,while the remainder were consigned to nameless misery in the mines, or underthe lash in the cane and rice fields. The guilt of this great crime rests onthe Christian Church. \"In the name of the most Holy Trinity\" the SpanishGovernment (Roman Catholic) concluded more than ten treaties authorizing thesale of five hundred thousand human beings; in 1562 Sir John Hawkins sailedon his diabolical errand of buying slaves in Africa and selling them in theWest Indies in a ship which bore the sacred name of Jesus; while Elizabeth,the Protestant Queen, rewarded him for his success in this first adventureof Englishmen in that inhuman traffic by allowing him to wear as his crest\"a demi-Moor in his proper color, bound with a cord, or, in other words, amanacled negro slave.\"Q. I have heard you say that the identity of our physical origin is provedby science, that of our spiritual origin by the Wisdom-Religion. Yet we donot find Darwinists exhibiting great fraternal affection.A. Just so. This is what shows the deficiency of the materialistic systems,and proves that we Theosophists are in the right. The identity of ourphysical origin makes no appeal to our higher and deeper feelings. Matter,deprived of its soul and spirit, or its divine essence, cannot speak to thehuman heart. But the identity of the soul and spirit, of real, immortal man,as Theosophy teaches us, once proven and deep-rooted in our hearts, wouldlead us far on the road of real charity and brotherly goodwill.Q. But how does Theosophy explain the common origin of man? 1. By teaching that the root of all nature, objective and subjective, and everything else in the universe, visible and invisible, is, was, and ever will be one absolute essence, from which all starts, and into which everything returns. This is Aryan *) philosophy, fully represented only by the Vedantins, and the Buddhist system. With this object in view, it is the duty of all Theosophists to promote in every practical way, and in all countries, the spread of non-sectarian education.*) See remark on the use of the word Aryan a couple of pages backPage 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. What do the written statutes of your Society advise its members to dobesides this? On the physical plane, I mean?A. In order to awaken brotherly feeling among nations we have to assist inthe international exchange of useful arts and products, by advice,information, and cooperation with all worthy individuals and associations(provided, however, add the statutes, \"that no benefit or percentage shallbe taken by the Society or the 'Fellows' for its or their corporateservices\"). For instance, to take a practical illustration. The organizationof Society, depicted by Edward Bellamy, in his magnificent work LookingBackwards, admirably represents the Theosophical idea of what should be thefirst great step towards the full realization of universal brotherhood. Thestate of things he depicts falls short of perfection, because selfishnessstill exists and operates in the hearts of men. But in the main, selfishnessand individualism have been overcome by the feeling of solidarity and mutualbrotherhood; and the scheme of life there described reduces the causestending to create and foster selfishness to a minimum.Q. Then as a Theosophist you will take part in an effort to realize such anideal?A. Certainly; and we have proved it by action. Have not you heard of theNationalist clubs and party which have sprung up in America since thepublication of Bellamy's book? They are now coming prominently to the front,and will do so more and more as time goes on. Well, these clubs and thisparty were started in the first instance by Theosophists. One of the first,the Nationalist Club of Boston, Massachusetts, has Theosophists forPresident and Secretary, and the majority of its executive belong to theT.S. In the constitution of all their clubs, and of the party they areforming, the influence of Theosophy and of the Society is plain, for theyall take as their basis, their first and fundamental principle, theBrotherhood of Humanity as taught by Theosophy. In their declaration ofPrinciples they state:The principle of the Brotherhood of Humanity is one of the eternal truthsthat govern the world's progress on lines which distinguish human naturefrom brute nature.What can be more Theosophical than this? But it is not enough. What is alsoneeded is to impress men with the idea that, if the root of mankind is one,then there must also be one truth which finds expression in all the variousreligions-except in the Jewish, as you do not find it expressed even in theCabala.Q. This refers to the common origin of religions, and you may be rightthere. But how does it apply to practical brotherhood on the physical plane?A. First, because that which is true on the metaphysical plane must be alsotrue on the physical. Secondly, because there is no more fertile source ofhatred and strife than religious differences. When one party or anotherthinks himself the sole possessor of absolute truth, it becomes only naturalthat he should think his neighbor absolutely in the clutches of Error or theDevil. But once get a man to see that none of them has the whole truth, butthat they are mutually complementary, that the complete truth can be foundonly in the combined views of all, after that which is false in each of themhas been sifted out-then true brotherhood in religion will be established.The same applies in the physical world.Q. Please explain further.A. Take an instance. A plant consists of a root, a stem, and many shoots andleaves. As humanity, as a whole, is the stem which grows from the spiritualroot, so is the stem the unity of the plant. Hurt the stem and it is obviousPage 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtthat every shoot and leaf will suffer. So it is with mankind.Q. Yes, but if you injure a leaf or a shoot, you do not injure the wholeplant.A. And therefore you think that by injuring one man you do not injurehumanity? But how do you know? Are you aware that even materialistic scienceteaches that any injury, however, slight, to a plant will affect the wholecourse of its future growth and development? Therefore, you are mistaken,and the analogy is perfect. If, however, you overlook the fact that a cut inthe finger may often make the whole body suffer, and react on the wholenervous system, I must all the more remind you that there may well be otherspiritual laws, operating on plants and animals as well as on mankind,although, as you do not recognize their action on plants and animals, youmay deny their existence.Q. What laws do you mean?A. We call them Karmic laws; but you will not understand the full meaning ofthe term unless you study Occultism. However, my argument did not rest onthe assumption of these laws, but really on the analogy of the plant. Expandthe idea, carry it out to a universal application, and you will soon findthat in true philosophy every physical action has its moral and everlastingeffect. Hurt a man by doing him bodily harm; you may think that his pain andsuffering cannot spread by any means to his neighbors, least of all to menof other nations. We affirm that it will, in good time. Therefore, we say,that unless every man is brought to understand and accept as an axiomatictruth that by having wronged one man we wrong not only ourselves but thewhole of humanity in the long run, no brotherly feelings such as preached byall the great Reformers, preeminently by Buddha and Jesus, are possible onearth.  -oOo-Our Other ObjectsQ. Will you now explain the methods by which you propose to carry out thesecond object?A. To collect for the library at our headquarters of Adyar, Madras-and bythe Fellows of their Branches for their local libraries-all the good worksupon the world's religions that we can. To put into written form correctinformation upon the various ancient philosophies, traditions, and legends,and disseminate the same in such practicable ways as the translation andpublication of original works of value, and extracts from and commentariesupon the same, or the oral instructions of persons learned in theirrespective departments.Q. And what about the third object, to develop in man his latent spiritualor psychic powers?A. This has to be achieved also by means of publications, in those placeswhere no lectures and personal teachings are possible. Our duty is to keepalive in man his spiritual intuitions. To oppose and counteract-after dueinvestigation and proof of its irrational nature-bigotry in every form,religious, scientific, or social, and cant above all, whether as religioussectarianism or as belief in miracles or anything supernatural. What we haveto do is to seek to obtain knowledge of all the laws of nature, and todiffuse it. To encourage the study of those laws least understood by modernpeople, the so-called Occult Sciences, based on the true knowledge ofnature, instead of, as at present, on superstitious beliefs based on blindfaith and authority. Popular folklore and traditions, however fanciful attimes, when sifted may lead to the discovery of long-lost, but important,secrets of nature. The Society, therefore, aims at pursuing this line ofPage 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtinquiry, in the hope of widening the field of scientific and philosophicalobservation.  -oOo-On the Sacredness of the PledgeQ. Have you any ethical system that you carry out in the Society?A. The ethics are there, ready and clear enough for whomsoever would followthem. They are the essence and cream of the world's ethics, gathered fromthe teachings of all the world's great reformers. Therefore, you will findrepresented therein Confucius and Zoroaster, Lao-tzu and the Bhagavad-Gita ,the precepts of Gautama Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth, of Hillel and hisschool, as of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and their schools.Q. Do the members of your Society carry out these precepts? I have heard ofgreat dissensions and quarrels among them.A. Very naturally, since although the reform (in its present shape) may becalled new, the men and women to be reformed are the same human, sinningnatures as of old. As already said, the earnest working members are few; butmany are the sincere and well-disposed persons, who try their best to liveup to the Society's and their own ideals. Our duty is to encourage andassist individual fellows in self-improvement, intellectual, moral, andspiritual; not to blame or condemn those who fail. We have, strictlyspeaking, no right to refuse admission to anyone-especially in the EsotericSection of the Society, wherein \"he who enters is as one newly born.\" But ifany member, his sacred pledges on his word of honor and immortal Selfnotwithstanding, chooses to continue, after that \"new birth,\" with the newman, the vices or defects of his old life, and to indulge in them still inthe Society, then, of course, he is more than likely to be asked to resignand withdraw; or, in case of his refusal, to be expelled. We have thestrictest rules for such emergencies.Q. Can some of them be mentioned?A. They can. To begin with, no Fellow in the Society, whether exoteric oresoteric, has a right to force his personal opinions upon another Fellow.It is not lawful for any officer of the Parent Society to express in public,by word or act, any hostility to, or preference for, any one section,religious or philosophical, more than another. All have an equal right tohave the essential features of their religious belief laid before thetribunal of an impartial world. And no officer of the Society, in hiscapacity as an officer, has the right to preach his own sectarian views andbeliefs to members assembled, except when the meeting consists of hisco-religionists. After due warning, violation of this rule shall be punishedby suspension or expulsion.This is one of the offenses in the Society at large. As regards the innersection, now called the Esoteric, the following rules have been laid downand adopted, so far back as 1880.No Fellow shall put to his selfish use any knowledge communicated to him byany member of the first section (now a higher \"degree\"); violation of therule being punished by expulsion.Now, however, before any such knowledge can be imparted, the applicant hasto bind himself by a solemn oath not to use it for selfish purposes, nor toreveal anything said except by permission.Q. But is a man expelled, or resigning, from the section free to revealanything he may have learned, or to break any clause of the pledge he hasPage 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txttaken?A. Certainly not. His expulsion or resignation only relieves him from theobligation of obedience to the teacher, and from that of taking an activepart in the work of the Society, but surely not from the sacred pledge ofsecrecy.Q. But is this reasonable and just?A. Most assuredly. To any man or woman with the slightest honorable feelinga pledge of secrecy taken even on one's word of honor, much more to one'sHigher Self-the God within-is binding till death. And though he may leavethe Section and the Society, no man or woman of honor will think ofattacking or injuring a body to which he or she has been so pledged.Q. But is not this going rather far?A. Perhaps so, according to the low standard of the present time andmorality. But if it does not bind as far as this, what use is a pledge atall? How can anyone expect to be taught secret knowledge, if he is to be atliberty to free himself from all the obligations he had taken, whenever hepleases? What security, confidence, or trust would ever exist among men, ifpledges such as this were to have no really binding force at all? Believeme, the law of retribution (Karma) would very soon overtake one who so brokehis pledge, and perhaps as soon as the contempt of every honorable manwould, even on this physical plane. As well expressed in the New York Pathjust cited on this subject,A pledge once taken, is forever binding in both the moral and the occultworlds. If we break it once and are punished, that does not justify us inbreaking it again, and so long as we do, so long will the mighty lever ofthe Law (of Karma) react upon us.The Relations of the T.S. to Theosophy  On Self-ImprovementQ. Is moral elevation, then, the principal thing insisted upon in yourSociety?A. Undoubtedly! He who would be a true Theosophist must bring himself tolive as one.Q. If so, then, as I remarked before, the behavior of some members strangelybelies this fundamental rule.A. Indeed it does. But this cannot be helped among us, any more than amongstthose who call themselves Christians and act like fiends. This is no faultof our statutes and rules, but that of human nature. Even in some exotericpublic branches, the members pledge themselves on their \"Higher Self\" tolive the life prescribed by Theosophy. They have to bring their Divine Selfto guide their every thought and action, every day and at every moment oftheir lives. A true Theosophist ought \"to deal justly and walk humbly.\"Q. What do you mean by this?A. Simply this: the one self has to forget itself for the many selves. Letme answer you in the words of a true Philaletheian, an F.T.S., who hasbeautifully expressed it in The Theosophist:What every man needs first is to find himself, and then take an honestinventory of his subjective possessions, and, bad or bankrupt as it may be,it is not beyond redemption if we set about it in earnest.Page 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtBut how many do? All are willing to work for their own development andprogress; very few for those of others. To quote the same writer again:Men have been deceived and deluded long enough; they must break their idols,put away their shams, and go to work for themselves-nay, there is one littleword too much or too many, for he who works for himself had better not workat all; rather let him work himself for others, for all. For every flower oflove and charity he plants in his neighbor's garden, a loathsome weed willdisappear from his own, and so this garden of the gods-Humanity-shallblossom as a rose. In all Bibles, all religions, this is plainly setforth-but designing men have at first misinterpreted and finallyemasculated, materialized, besotted them. It does not require a newrevelation. Let every man be a revelation unto himself. Let once man'simmortal spirit take possession of the temple of his body, drive out themoney-changers and every unclean thing, and his own divine humanity willredeem him, for when he is thus at one with himself he will know the\"builder of the Temple.\"Q. This is pure Altruism, I confess.A. It is. And if only one Fellow of the T.S. out of ten would practice itours would be a body of elect indeed. But there are those among theoutsiders who will always refuse to see the essential difference betweenTheosophy and the Theosophical Society, the idea and its imperfectembodiment. Such would visit every sin and shortcoming of the vehicle, thehuman body, on the pure spirit which sheds thereon its divine light. Is thisjust to either? They throw stones at an association that tries to work upto, and for the propagation of, its ideal with most tremendous odds againstit. Some vilify the Theosophical Society only because it presumes to attemptto do that in which other systems-Church and State Christianitypreeminently-have failed most egregiously; others because they would fainpreserve the existing state of things: Pharisees and Sadducees in the seatof Moses, and publicans and sinners revelling in high places, as under theRoman Empire during its decadence. Fair-minded people, at any rate, ought toremember that the man who does all he can, does as much as he who hasachieved the most, in this world of relative possibilities. This is a simpletruism, an axiom supported for believers in the Gospels by the parable ofthe talents given by their Master: the servant who doubled his two talentswas rewarded as much as that other fellow-servant who had received five. Toevery man it is given \"according to his several ability.\"Q. Yet it is rather difficult to draw the line of demarcation between theabstract and the concrete in this case, as we have only the latter to formour judgment by.A. Then why make an exception for the T.S.? Justice, like charity, ought tobegin at home. Will you revile and scoff at the \"Sermon on the Mount\"because your social, political and even religious laws have, so far, notonly failed to carry out its precepts in their spirit, but even in theirdead letter? Abolish the oath in Courts, Parliament, Army and everywhere,and do as the Quakers do, if you will call yourselves Christians. Abolishthe Courts themselves, for if you would follow the Commandments of Christ,you have to give away your coat to him who deprives you of your cloak, andturn your left cheek to the bully who smites you on the right. \"Resist notevil, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them thathate you,\" for \"whosoever shall break one of the least of these Commandmentsand shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the Kingdom ofHeaven,\" and \"whosoever shall say 'Thou fool' shall be in danger of hellfire.\" And why should you judge, if you would not be judged in your turn?Insist that between Theosophy and the Theosophical Society there is nodifference, and forthwith you lay the system of Christianity and its veryessence open to the same charges, only in a more serious form.Q. Why more serious?Page 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. Because, while the leaders of the Theosophical Movement, recognizingfully their shortcomings, try all they can do to amend their ways and uprootthe evil existing in the Society; and while their rules and bylaws areframed in the spirit of Theosophy, the Legislators and the Churches ofnations and countries which call themselves Christian do the reverse. Ourmembers, even the worst among them, are no worse than the average Christian.Moreover, if the Western Theosophists experience so much difficulty inleading the true Theosophical life, it is because they are all the childrenof their generation. Every one of them was a Christian, bred and brought upin the sophistry of his Church, his social customs, and even his paradoxicallaws. He was this before he became a Theosophist, or rather, a member of theSociety of that name, as it cannot be too often repeated that between theabstract ideal and its vehicle there is a most important difference.  -oOo-The Abstract and the ConcreteQ. Please elucidate this difference a little more.A. The Society is a great body of men and women, composed of the mostheterogeneous elements. Theosophy, in its abstract meaning, is DivineWisdom, or the aggregate of the knowledge and wisdom that underlie theUniverse-the homogeneity of eternal good; and in its concrete sense it isthe sumtotal of the same as allotted to man by nature, on this earth, and nomore. Some members earnestly endeavor to realize and, so to speak, toobjectivize Theosophy in their lives; while others desire only to know of,not to practice it; and others still may have joined the Society merely outof curiosity, or a passing interest, or perhaps, again, because some oftheir friends belong to it. How, then, can the system be judged by thestandard of those who would assume the name without any right to it? Ispoetry or its muse to be measured only by those would-be poets who afflictour ears? The Society can be regarded as the embodiment of Theosophy only inits abstract motives; it can never presume to call itself its concretevehicle so long as human imperfections and weaknesses are all represented inits body; otherwise the Society would be only repeating the great error andthe outflowing sacrilege of the so-called Churches of Christ. If Easterncomparisons may be permitted, Theosophy is the shoreless ocean of universaltruth, love, and wisdom, reflecting its radiance on the earth, while theTheosophical Society is only a visible bubble on that reflection. Theosophyis divine nature, visible and invisible, and its Society human nature tryingto ascend to its divine parent. Theosophy, finally, is the fixed eternalsun, and its Society the evanescent comet trying to settle in an orbit tobecome a planet, ever revolving within the attraction of the sun of truth.It was formed to assist in showing to men that such a thing as Theosophyexists, and to help them to ascend towards it by studying and assimilatingits eternal verities.Q. I thought you said you had no tenets or doctrines of your own?A. No more we have. The Society has no wisdom of its own to support orteach. It is simply the storehouse of all the truths uttered by the greatseers, initiates, and prophets of historic and even prehistoric ages; atleast, as many as it can get. Therefore, it is merely the channel throughwhich more or less of truth, found in the accumulated utterances ofhumanity's great teachers, is poured out into the world.Q. But is such truth unreachable outside of the society? Does not everyChurch claim the same?A. Not at all. The undeniable existence of great initiates-true \"Sons ofGod\"-shows that such wisdom was often reached by isolated individuals,never, however, without the guidance of a master at first. But most of thePage 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtfollowers of such, when they became masters in their turn, have dwarfed theCatholicism of these teachings into the narrow groove of their own sectariandogmas. The commandments of a chosen master alone were then adopted andfollowed, to the exclusion of all others-if followed at all, note well, asin the case of the Sermon on the Mount. Each religion is thus a bit of thedivine truth, made to focus a vast panorama of human fancy which claimed torepresent and replace that truth.Q. But Theosophy, you say, is not a religion?A. Most assuredly it is not, since it is the essence of all religion and ofabsolute truth, a drop of which only underlies every creed. To resort oncemore to metaphor. Theosophy, on earth, is like the white ray of thespectrum, and every religion only one of the seven prismatic colors.Ignoring all the others, and cursing them as false, every special coloredray claims not only priority, but to be that white ray itself, andanathematizes even its own tints from light to dark, as heresies. Yet, asthe sun of truth rises higher and higher on the horizon of man's perception,and each colored ray gradually fades out until it is finally reabsorbed inits turn, humanity will at last be cursed no longer with artificialpolarizations, but will find itself bathing in the pure colorless sunlightof eternal truth. And this will be Theosophia.Q. Your claim is, then, that all the great religions are derived fromTheosophy, and that it is by assimilating it that the world will be finallysaved from the curse of its great illusions and errors?A. Precisely so. And we add that our Theosophical Society is the humble seedwhich, if watered and left to live, will finally produce the Tree ofKnowledge of Good and Evil which is grafted on the Tree of Life Eternal. Forit is only by studying the various great religions and philosophies ofhumanity, by comparing them dispassionately and with an unbiased mind, thatmen can hope to arrive at the truth. It is especially by finding out andnoting their various points of agreement that we may achieve this result.For no sooner do we arrive-either by study, or by being taught by someonewho knows-at their inner meaning, than we find, almost in every case, thatit expresses some great truth in Nature.Q. We have heard of a Golden Age that was, and what you describe would be aGolden Age to be realized at some future day. When shall it be?A. Not before humanity, as a whole, feels the need of it. A maxim in thePersian Javidan Khirad says:Truth is of two kinds-one manifest and self-evident; the other demandingincessantly new demonstrations and proofs.It is only when this latter kind of truth becomes as universally obvious asit is now dim, and therefore liable to be distorted by sophistry andcasuistry; it is only when the two kinds will have become once more one,that all people will be brought to see alike.Q. But surely those few who have felt the need of such truths must have madeup their minds to believe in something definite? You tell me that, theSociety having no doctrines of its own, every member may believe as hechooses and accept what he pleases. This looks as if the TheosophicalSociety was bent upon reviving the confusion of languages and beliefs of theTower of Babel of old. Have you no beliefs in common?A. What is meant by the Society having no tenets or doctrines of its own is,that no special doctrines or beliefs are obligatory on its members; but, ofcourse, this applies only to the body as a whole. The Society, as you weretold, is divided into an outer and an inner body. Those who belong to thelatter have, of course, a philosophy, or-if you so prefer it-a religiousPage 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtsystem of their own.Q. May we be told what it is?A. We make no secret of it. It was outlined a few years ago in TheTheosophist and Esoteric Buddhism, and may be found still more elaborated inThe Secret Doctrine. It is based on the oldest philosophy of the world,called the Wisdom-Religion or the Archaic Doctrine. If you like, you may askquestions and have them explained.The Fundamental Teachings of Theosophy  On God and PrayerQ. Do you believe in God?A. That depends what you mean by the term.Q. I mean the God of the Christians, the Father of Jesus, and the Creator:the Biblical God of Moses, in short.A. In such a God we do not believe. We reject the idea of a personal, or anextra-cosmic and anthropomorphic God, who is but the gigantic shadow of man,and not of man at his best, either. The God of theology, we say-and proveit-is a bundle of contradictions and a logical impossibility. Therefore, wewill have nothing to do with him.Q. State your reasons, if you please.A. They are many, and cannot all receive attention. But here are a few. ThisGod is called by his devotees infinite and absolute, is he not?Q. I believe he is.A. Then, if infinite-i.e., limitless-and especially if absolute, how can hehave a form, and be a creator of anything? Form implies limitation, and abeginning as well as an end; and, in order to create, a Being must think andplan. How can the absolute be supposed to think-i.e., to have any relationwhatever to that which is limited, finite, and conditioned? This is aphilosophical, and a logical absurdity. Even the Hebrew Cabala rejects suchan idea, and therefore, makes of the one and the Absolute DeificPrinciple an infinite Unity called Ain-Soph *)*)Ain-Soph (Greek: toh pan, epeiros), the boundless or limitless, in and ofnature, the non-existing that IS, but that is not a Being.In order to create, the Creator has to become active; and as this isimpossible for absoluteness, the infinite principle had to be shown becomingthe cause of evolution (not creation) in an indirect way-i.e., through theemanation from itself (another absurdity, due this time to the translatorsof the Cabala) of the Sephiroth.How can the non-active eternal principle emanate or emit? The Parabrahman ofthe Vedantins does nothing of the kind; nor does the Ain-Soph of theChaldean Cabala. It is an eternal and periodical law which causes an activeand creative force (the logos) to emanate from the ever-concealed andincomprehensible one principle at the beginning of every Mah -Manvantara, ornew cycle of life.Q. How about those Cabalists, who, while being such, still believe inJehovah, or the Tetragrammaton?A. They are at liberty to believe in what they please, as their belief orPage 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtdisbelief can hardly affect a self-evident fact. The Jesuits tell us thattwo and two are not always four to a certainty, since it depends on the willof God to make 2 × 2 = 5. Shall we accept their sophistry for all that?Q. Then you are Atheists?A. Not that we know of, and not unless the epithet of \"Atheist\" is to beapplied to those who disbelieve in an anthropomorphic God. We believe in aUniversal Divine Principle, the root of all, from which all proceeds, andwithin which all shall be absorbed at the end of the great cycle of Being.Q. This is the old, old claim of Pantheism. If you are Pantheists, youcannot be Deists; and if you are not Deists, then you have to answer to thename of Atheists.A. Not necessarily so. The term Pantheism is again one of the many abusedterms, whose real and primitive meaning has been distorted by blindprejudice and a one-sided view of it. If you accept the Christian etymologyof this compound word, and form it of pan , \"all,\" and theos , \"god,\" andthen imagine and teach that this means that every stone and every tree inNature is a God or the one God, then, of course, you will be right, and makeof Pantheists fetish-worshippers, in addition to their legitimate name. Butyou will hardly be as successful if you etymologize the word Pantheismesoterically, and as we do.Q. What is, then, your definition of it?A. Let me ask you a question in my turn. What do you understand by Pan, orNature?Q. Nature is, I suppose, the sumtotal of things existing around us; theaggregate of causes and effects in the world of matter, the creation oruniverse.A. Hence the personified sum and order of known causes and effects; thetotal of all finite agencies and forces, as utterly disconnected from anintelligent Creator or Creators, and perhaps \"conceived of as a single andseparate force\"-as in your encyclopedias?Q. Yes, I believe so.A. Well, we neither take into consideration this objective and materialnature, which we call an evanescent illusion, nor do we mean by Nature, inthe sense of its accepted derivation from the Latin Natura (becoming, fromnasci, to be born). When we speak of the Deity and make it identical, hencecoeval, with Nature, the eternal and uncreate nature is meant, and not youraggregate of flitting shadows and finite unrealities. We leave it to thehymn-makers to call the visible sky or heaven, God's Throne, and our earthof mud His footstool. Our deity is neither in a paradise, nor in aparticular tree, building, or mountain: it is everywhere, in every atom ofthe visible as of the invisible Cosmos, in, over, and around every invisibleatom and divisible molecule; for it is the mysterious power of evolution andinvolution, the omnipresent, omnipotent, and even omniscient creativepotentiality.Q. Stop! Omniscience is the prerogative of something that thinks, and youdeny to your Absoluteness the power of thought.A. We deny it to the absolute, since thought is something limited andconditioned. But you evidently forget that in philosophy absoluteunconsciousness is also absolute consciousness, as otherwise it would not beabsolute.Q. Then your Absolute thinks?Page 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. No, it does not; for the simple reason that it is Absolute Thoughtitself. Nor does it exist, for the same reason, as it is absolute existence,and Be-ness, not a Being. Read the superb Cabalistic poem by Solomon BenJehudah Gabirol, in the Kether-Malchut, and you will understand:Thou art one, the root of all numbers, but not as an element of numeration;for unity admits not of multiplication, change, or form.Thou art one, and in the secret of Thy unity the wisest of men are lost,because they know it not.Thou art one, and Thy unity is never diminished, never extended, and cannotbe changed.Thou art one, and no thought of mine can fix for Thee a limit, or defineThee.Thou art, but not as one existent, for the understanding and vision ofmortals cannot attain to Thy existence, nor determine for Thee the where,the how and the why ...In short, our Deity is the eternal, incessantly evolving, not creating,builder of the universe; that universe itself unfolding out of its ownessence, not being made. It is a sphere, without circumference, in itssymbolism, which has but one ever-acting attribute embracing all otherexisting or thinkable attributes-itself. It is the one law, giving theimpulse to manifested, eternal, and immutable laws, within thatnever-manifesting, because absolute law, which in its manifesting periods isThe ever-Becoming.Q. I once heard one of your members remarking that Universal Deity, beingeverywhere, was in vessels of dishonor, as in those of honor, and,therefore, was present in every atom of my cigar ash! Is this not rankblasphemy?A. I do not think so, as simple logic can hardly be regarded as blasphemy.Were we to exclude the Omnipresent Principle from one single mathematicalpoint of the universe, or from a particle of matter occupying anyconceivable space, could we still regard it as infinite?  -oOo-Is it Necessary to Pray?Q. Do you believe in prayer, and do you ever pray?A. We do not. We act, instead of talking.Q. You do not offer prayers even to the Absolute Principle?A. Why should we? Being well-occupied people, we can hardly afford to losetime in addressing verbal prayers to a pure abstraction. The Unknowable iscapable of relations only in its parts to each other, but is non-existent asregards any finite relations. The visible universe depends for its existenceand phenomena on its mutually acting forms and their laws, not on prayer orprayers.Q. Do you not believe at all in the efficacy of prayer?A. Not in prayer taught in so many words and repeated externally, if byprayer you mean the outward petition to an unknown God as the addressee,which was inaugurated by the Jews and popularized by the Pharisees.Page 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. Is there any other kind of prayer?A. Most decidedly; we call it will-prayer, and it is rather an internalcommand than a petition.Q. To whom, then, do you pray when you do so?A. To \"our Father in heaven\"-in its esoteric meaning.Q. Is that different from the one given to it in theology?A. Entirely so. An Occultist or a Theosophist addresses his prayer to hisFather which is in secret, not to an extra-cosmic and therefore finite God;and that \"Father\" is in man himself.Q. Then you make of man a God?A. Please say \"God\" and not a God. In our sense, the inner man is the onlyGod we can have cognizance of. And how can this be otherwise? Grant us ourpostulate that God is a universally diffused, infinite principle, and howcan man alone escape from being soaked through by, and in, the Deity? Wecall our \"Father in heaven\" that deific essence of which we are cognizantwithin us, in our heart and spiritual consciousness, and which has nothingto do with the anthropomorphic conception we may form of it in our physicalbrain or its fancy: \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that thespirit of (the absolute) God dwelleth in you?\"One often finds in Theosophical writings conflicting statements about theChristos principle in man. Some call it the sixth principle (Buddhi), othersthe seventh (Atma). If Christian Theosophists wish to make use of suchexpressions, let them be made philosophically correct by following theanalogy of the old Wisdom-Religion symbols. We say that Christos is not onlyone of the three higher principles, but all the three regarded as a Trinity.This Trinity represents the Holy Ghost, the Father, and the Son, as itanswers to abstract spirit, differentiated spirit, and embodied spirit.Krishna and Christ are philosophically the same principle under its tripleaspect of manifestation. In the Bhagavad-Gita we find Krishna callinghimself indifferently Atma, the abstract Spirit, Kshetrajña, the Higher orreincarnating Ego, and the Universal Self, all names which, when transferredfrom the Universe to man, answer to Atma, Buddhi, and Manas. The Anugita isfull of the same doctrine.Yet, let no man anthropomorphize that essence in us. Let no Theosophist, ifhe would hold to divine, not human truth, say that this \"God in secret\"listens to, or is distinct from, either finite man or the infiniteessence-for all are one. Nor, as just remarked, that a prayer is a petition.It is a mystery rather; an occult process by which finite and conditionedthoughts and desires, unable to be assimilated by the absolute spirit whichis unconditioned, are translated into spiritual wills and the will; suchprocess being called \"spiritual transmutation.\" The intensity of our ardentaspirations changes prayer into the \"philosopher's stone,\" or that whichtransmutes lead into pure gold. The only homogeneous essence, our\"will-prayer\" becomes the active or creative force, producing effectsaccording to our desire.Q. Do you mean to say that prayer is an occult process bringing aboutphysical results?A. I do. Will-Power becomes a living power. But woe unto those Occultistsand Theosophists, who, instead of crushing out the desires of the lowerpersonal ego or physical man, and saying, addressing their Higher SpiritualEgo immersed in Atma-Buddhic light, \"Thy will be done, not mine,\" etc., sendup waves of will-power for selfish or unholy purposes! For this is blackmagic, abomination, and spiritual sorcery. Unfortunately, all this is thePage 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtfavorite occupation of our Christian statesmen and generals, especially whenthe latter are sending two armies to murder each other. Both indulge beforeaction in a bit of such sorcery, by offering respectively prayers to thesame God of Hosts, each entreating his help to cut its enemies' throats.Q. David prayed to the Lord of Hosts to help him smite the Philistines andslay the Syrians and the Moabites, and \"the Lord preserved Davidwhithersoever he went.\" In that we only follow what we find in the Bible.A. Of course you do. But since you delight in calling yourselves Christians,not Israelites or Jews, as far as we know, why do you not rather follow thatwhich Christ says? And he distinctly commands you not to follow \"them of oldtimes,\" or the Mosaic law, but bids you do as he tells you, and warns thosewho would kill by the sword, that they, too, will perish by the sword.Christ has given you one prayer of which you have made a lip prayer and aboast, and which none but the true Occultist understands. In it you say, inyour dead-sense meaning: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,\"which you never do. Again, he told you to love your enemies and do good tothem that hate you. It is surely not the \"meek prophet of Nazareth\" whotaught you to pray to your \"Father\" to slay, and give you victory over yourenemies! This is why we reject what you call \"prayers.\"Q. But how do you explain the universal fact that all nations and peopleshave prayed to, and worshiped a God or Gods? Some have adored andpropitiated devils and harmful spirits, but this only proves theuniversality of the belief in the efficacy of prayer.A. It is explained by that other fact that prayer has several other meaningsbesides that given it by the Christians. It means not only a pleading orpetition, but meant, in days of old, far more an invocation and incantation.The mantra, or the rhythmically chanted prayer of the Hindus, has preciselysuch a meaning, as the Brahmins hold themselves higher than the common devasor \"Gods.\" A prayer may be an appeal or an incantation for malediction, anda curse (as in the case of two armies praying simultaneously for mutualdestruction) as much as for blessing. And as the great majority of peopleare intensely selfish, and pray only for themselves, asking to be giventheir \"daily bread\" instead of working for it, and begging God not to leadthem \"into temptation\" but to deliver them (the memorialists only) fromevil, the result is, that prayer, as now understood, is doubly pernicious:(a) It kills in man self-reliance; (b) It develops in him a still moreferocious selfishness and egotism than he is already endowed with by nature.I repeat, that we believe in \"communion\" and simultaneous action in unisonwith our \"Father in secret\"; and in rare moments of ecstatic bliss, in themingling of our higher soul with the universal essence, attracted as it istowards its origin and center, a state, called during life Samadhi, andafter death, Nirvana. We refuse to pray to created finite beings-i.e., gods,saints, angels, etc., because we regard it as idolatry. We cannot pray tothe absolute for reasons explained before; therefore, we try to replacefruitless and useless prayer by meritorious and good-producing actions.Q. Christians would call it pride and blasphemy. Are they wrong?A. Entirely so. It is they, on the contrary, who show Satanic pride in theirbelief that the Absolute or the Infinite, even if there was such a thing asthe possibility of any relation between the unconditioned and theconditioned-will stoop to listen to every foolish or egotistical prayer. Andit is they again, who virtually blaspheme, in teaching that an Omniscientand Omnipotent God needs uttered prayers to know what he has to do!This-understood esoterically-is corroborated by both Buddha and Jesus. Theone says:Seek nought from the helpless Gods-pray not! but rather act; for darknesswill not brighten. Ask nought from silence, for it can neither speak norhear.Page 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtAnd the other-Jesus-recommends: \"Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name (that ofChristos) that will I do.\" Of course, this quotation, if taken in itsliteral sense, goes against our argument. But if we accept it esoterically,with the full knowledge of the meaning of the term Christos which to usrepresents Atma-Buddhi-Manas, the \"self,\" it comes to this: the only God wemust recognize and pray to, or rather act in unison with, is that spirit ofGod of which our body is the temple, and in which it dwelleth.  -oOo-Prayer Kills Self-RelianceQ. But did not Christ himself pray and recommend prayer?A. It is so recorded, but those \"prayers\" are precisely of that kind ofcommunion just mentioned with one's \"Father in secret.\" Otherwise, and if weidentify Jesus with the universal deity, there would be something tooabsurdly illogical in the inevitable conclusion that he, the \"very Godhimself\" prayed to himself, and separated the will of that God from his own!Q. One argument more; an argument, moreover, much used by some Christians.They say,I feel that I am not able to conquer any passions and weaknesses in my ownstrength. But when I pray to Jesus Christ I feel that he gives me strengthand that in His power I am able to conquer.A. No wonder. If \"Christ Jesus\" is God, and one independent and separatefrom him who prays, of course everything is, and must be possible to \"amighty God.\" But, then, where's the merit, or justice either, of such aconquest? Why should the pseudo-conqueror be rewarded for something donewhich has cost him only prayers? Would you, even a simple mortal man, payyour laborer a full day's wage if you did most of his work for him, hesitting under an apple tree, and praying to you to do so, all the while?This idea of passing one's whole life in moral idleness, and having one'shardest work and duty done by another-whether God or man-is most revoltingto us, as it is most degrading to human dignity.Q. Perhaps so, yet it is the idea of trusting in a personal Savior to helpand strengthen in the battle of life, which is the fundamental idea ofmodern Christianity. And there is no doubt that, subjectively, such beliefis efficacious; i.e., that those who believe do feel themselves helped andstrengthened.A. Nor is there any more doubt, that some patients of \"Christian\" and\"Mental Scientists\"-the great \"Deniers\"-are also sometimes cured; nor thathypnotism, and suggestion, psychology, and even mediumship, will producesuch results, as often, if not oftener. You take into consideration, andstring on the thread of your argument, successes alone. And how about tentimes the number of failures? Surely you will not presume to say thatfailure is unknown even with a sufficiency of blind faith, among fanaticalChristians?Q. But how can you explain those cases which are followed by full success?Where does a Theosophist look to for power to subdue his passions andselfishness?A. To his Higher Self, the divine spirit, or the God in him, and to hisKarma. How long shall we have to repeat over and over again that the tree isknown by its fruit, the nature of the cause by its effects? You speak ofsubduing passions, and becoming good through and with the help of God orChrist. We ask, where do you find more virtuous, guiltless people,abstaining from sin and crime, in Christendom or Buddhism-in ChristianPage 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtcountries or in heathen lands? Statistics are there to give the answer andcorroborate our claims. According to the last census in Ceylon and India, inthe comparative table of crimes committed by Christians, Muslims, Hindus,Eurasians, Buddhists, etc., etc., on two millions of population taken atrandom from each, and covering the misdemeanors of several years, theproportion of crimes committed by the Christian stands as 15 to 4 as againstthose committed by the Buddhist population. No Orientalist, no historian ofany note, or traveler in Buddhist lands, from Bishop Bigandet and Abbé Huc,to Sir William Hunter and every fair-minded official, will fail to give thepalm of virtue to Buddhists before Christians. Yet the former (not the trueBuddhist Siamese sect, at all events) do not believe in either God or afuture reward, outside of this earth. They do not pray, neither priests norlaymen. \"Pray!\" they would exclaim in wonder, \"to whom, or what?\"Q. Then they are truly Atheists.A. Most undeniably, but they are also the most virtue-loving andvirtue-keeping men in the whole world. Buddhism says: Respect the religionsof other men and remain true to your own; but Church Christianity,denouncing all the gods of other nations as devils, would doom everynon-Christian to eternal perdition.Q. Does not the Buddhist priesthood do the same?A. Never. They hold too much to the wise precept found in the Dhammapada todo so, for they know that,If any man, whether he be learned or not, consider himself so great as todespise other men, he is like a blind man holding a candle-blind himself, heillumines others.  -oOo-On the Source of the Human SoulQ. How, then, do you account for man being endowed with a Spirit and Soul?Whence these?A. From the Universal Soul. Certainly not bestowed by a personal God. Whencethe moist element in the jelly-fish? From the Ocean which surrounds it, inwhich it lives and breathes and has its being, and whither it returns whendissolved.Q. So you reject the teaching that Soul is given, or breathed into man, byGod?A. We are obliged to. The \"Soul\" spoken of in Genesis is, as therein stated,the \"living Soul\" or Nephesh (the vital, animal soul) with which God (we say\"nature\" and immutable law) endows man like every animal. Is not at all thethinking soul or mind; least of all is it the immortal Spirit.Q. Well, let us put it otherwise: is it God who endows man with a humanrational Soul and immortal Spirit?A. Again, in the way you put the question, we must object to it. Since webelieve in no personal God, how can we believe that he endows man withanything? But granting, for the sake of argument, a God who takes uponhimself the risk of creating a new Soul for every new-born baby, all thatcan be said is that such a God can hardly be regarded as himself endowedwith any wisdom or prevision. Certain other difficulties and theimpossibility of reconciling this with the claims made for the mercy,justice, equity and omniscience of that God, are so many deadly reefs onwhich this theological dogma is daily and hourly broken.Page 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. What do you mean? What difficulties?A. I am thinking of an unanswerable argument offered once in my presence bya Singhalese Buddhist priest, a famous preacher, to a Christianmissionary-one in no way ignorant or unprepared for the public discussionduring which it was advanced. It was near Colombo, and the Missionary hadchallenged the priest Megattivati to give his reasons why the Christian Godshould not be accepted by the \"heathen.\" Well, the Missionary came out ofthat forever memorable discussion second best, as usual.Q. I should be glad to learn in what way.A. Simply this: the Buddhist priest premised by asking the padre whether hisGod had given commandments to Moses only for men to keep, but to be brokenby God himself. The missionary denied the supposition indignantly. Well,said his opponent,... you tell us that God makes no exceptions to this rule, and that no Soulcan be born without his will. Now God forbids adultery, among other things,and yet you say in the same breath that it is he who creates every babyborn, and he who endows it with a Soul. Are we then to understand that themillions of children born in crime and adultery are your God's work? Thatyour God forbids and punishes the breaking of his laws; and that,nevertheless, he creates daily and hourly souls for just such children?According to the simplest logic, your God is an accomplice in the crime;since, but for his help and interference, no such children of lust could beborn. Where is the justice of punishing not only the guilty parents but eventhe innocent babe for that which is done by that very God, whom yet youexonerate from any guilt himself?The missionary looked at his watch and suddenly found it was getting toolate for further discussion.Q. You forget that all such inexplicable cases are mysteries, and that weare forbidden by our religion to pry into the mysteries of God.A. No, we do not forget, but simply reject such impossibilities. Nor do wewant you to believe as we do. We only answer the questions you ask. We have,however, another name for your \"mysteries.\"  -oOo-The Buddhist Teachings on the AboveQ. What does Buddhism teach with regard to the Soul?A. It depends whether you mean exoteric, popular Buddhism, or its esotericteachings. The former explains itself in The Buddhist Catechism in thiswise:Soul it considers a word used by the ignorant to express a false idea. Ifeverything is subject to change, then man is included, and every materialpart of him must change. That which is subject to change is not permanent,so there can be no immortal survival of a changeful thing.This seems plain and definite. But when we come to the question that the newpersonality in each succeeding rebirth is the aggregate of \"Skandhas,\" orthe attributes, of the old personality, and ask whether this new aggregationof Skandhas is a new being likewise, in which nothing has remained of thelast, we read that:In one sense it is a new being, in another it is not. During this life theSkandhas are continually changing, while the man A.B. of forty is identicalas regards personality with the youth A.B. of eighteen, yet by the continualPage 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtwaste and reparation of his body and change of mind and character, he is adifferent being. Nevertheless, the man in his old age justly reaps thereward or suffering consequent upon his thoughts and actions at everyprevious stage of his life. So the new being of the rebirth, being the sameindividuality as before (but not the same personality), with but a changedform, or new aggregation of Skandhas, justly reaps the consequences of hisactions and thoughts in the previous existence.This is abstruse metaphysics, and plainly does not express disbelief in Soulby any means.Q. Is not something like this spoken of in Esoteric Buddhism?A. It is, for this teaching belongs both to Esoteric Budhism or SecretWisdom, and to the exoteric Buddhism, or the religious philosophy of GautamaBuddha.Q. But we are distinctly told that most of the Buddhists do not believe inthe Soul's immortality?A. No more do we, if you mean by Soul the personal Ego, orlife-Soul-Nephesh. But every learned Buddhist believes in the individual ordivine Ego. Those who do not, err in their judgment. They are as mistaken onthis point, as those Christians who mistake the theological interpolationsof the later editors of the Gospels about damnation and hellfire, forverbatim utterances of Jesus. Neither Buddha nor \"Christ\" ever wroteanything themselves, but both spoke in allegories and used \"dark sayings,\"as all true Initiates did, and will do for a long time yet to come. BothScriptures treat of all such metaphysical questions very cautiously, andboth, Buddhist and Christian records, sin by that excess of exotericism; thedead letter meaning far overshooting the mark in both cases.Q. Do you mean to suggest that neither the teachings of Buddha nor those ofChrist have been heretofore rightly understood?A. What I mean is just as you say. Both Gospels, the Buddhist and theChristian, were preached with the same object in view. Both reformers wereardent philanthropists and practical altruists-preaching most unmistakablySocialism of the noblest and highest type, self-sacrifice to the bitter end.\"Let the sins of the whole world fall upon me that I may relieve man'smisery and suffering!\" cries Buddha. \"I would not let one cry whom I couldsave!\" exclaims the Prince-beggar, clad in the refuse rags of theburial-grounds. \"Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and Iwill give you rest,\" is the appeal to the poor and the disinherited made bythe \"Man of Sorrows,\" who hath not where to lay his head. The teachings ofboth are boundless love for humanity, charity, forgiveness of injury,forgetfulness of self, and pity for the deluded masses; both show the samecontempt for riches, and make no difference between meum and tuum. Theirdesire was, without revealing to all the sacred mysteries of initiation, togive the ignorant and the misled, whose burden in life was too heavy forthem, hope enough and an inkling into the truth sufficient to support themin their heaviest hours. But the object of both Reformers was frustrated,owing to excess of zeal of their later followers. The words of the Mastershaving been misunderstood and misinterpreted, behold the consequences!Q. But surely Buddha must have repudiated the soul's immortality, if all theOrientalists and his own Priests say so!A. The Arhats began by following the policy of their Master and the majorityof the subsequent priests were not initiated, just as in Christianity; andso, little by little, the great esoteric truths became almost lost. A proofin point is, that, out of the two existing sects in Ceylon, the Siamesebelieves death to be the absolute annihilation of individuality andpersonality, and the other explains Nirvana, as we Theosophists do.Page 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. But why, in that case, do Buddhism and Christianity represent the twoopposite poles of such belief?A. Because the conditions under which they were preached were not the same.In India the Brahmins, jealous of their superior knowledge, and excludingfrom it every caste save their own, had driven millions of men into idolatryand almost fetishism. Buddha had to give the death-blow to an exuberance ofunhealthy fancy and fanatical superstition resulting from ignorance, such ashas rarely been known before or after. Better a philosophical atheism thansuch ignorant worship for those:Who cry upon their gods and are not heard,Or are not heeded ...-and who live and die in mental despair. He had to arrest first of all thismuddy torrent of superstition, to uproot errors before he gave out thetruth. And as he could not give out all, for the same good reason as Jesus,who reminds his disciples that the Mysteries of Heaven are not for theunintelligent masses, but for the elect alone, and therefore \"spake he tothem in parables\"-so his caution led Buddha to conceal too much. He evenrefused to say to the monk Vacchagotta whether there was, or was not an Egoin man. When pressed to answer, \"the Exalted one maintained silence.\"Buddha gives to Ananda, his initiated disciple, who inquires for the reasonof this silence, a plain and unequivocal answer in the dialogue translatedby Oldenburg from the Samyutta-Nikaya:If I, Ananda, when the wandering monk Vacchagotta asked me: \"Is there theEgo?\" had answered \"The Ego is,\" then that, Ananda, would have confirmed thedoctrine of the Samanas and Brahmans, who believed in permanence. If I,Ananda, when the wandering monk Vacchagotta asked me, \"Is there not theEgo?\" had answered, \"The Ego is not,\" then that, Ananda, would haveconfirmed the doctrine of those who believed in annihilation. If I, Ananda,when the wandering monk Vacchagotta asked me, \"Is there the Ego?\" hadanswered, \"The Ego is,\" would that have served my end, Ananda, by producingin him the knowledge: all existences (dhamma) are non-ego? But if I, Ananda,had answered, \"The Ego is not,\" then that, Ananda, would only have causedthe wandering monk Vacchagotta to be thrown from one bewilderment toanother: \"My Ego, did it not exist before? But now it exists no longer!\"This shows, better than anything, that Gautama Buddha withheld suchdifficult metaphysical doctrines from the masses in order not to perplexthem more. What he meant was the difference between the personal temporaryEgo and the Higher Self, which sheds its light on the imperishable Ego, thespiritual \"I\" of man.Q. This refers to Gautama, but in what way does it touch the Gospels?A. Read history and think over it. At the time the events narrated in theGospels are alleged to have happened, there was a similar intellectualfermentation taking place in the whole civilized world, only with oppositeresults in the East and the West. The old gods were dying out. While thecivilized classes drifted in the train of the unbelieving Sadducees intomaterialistic negations and mere dead-letter Mosaic form in Palestine, andinto moral dissolution in Rome, the lowest and poorer classes ran aftersorcery and strange gods, or became hypocrites and Pharisees. Once more thetime for a spiritual reform had arrived. The cruel, anthropomorphic andjealous God of the Jews, with his sanguinary laws of \"an eye for eye andtooth for tooth,\" of the shedding of blood and animal sacrifice, had to berelegated to a secondary place and replaced by the merciful \"Father inSecret.\" The latter had to be shown, not as an extra-Cosmic God, but as adivine Savior of the man of flesh, enshrined in his own heart and soul, inPage 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtthe poor as in the rich. No more here than in India, could the secrets ofinitiation be divulged, lest by giving that which is holy to the dogs, andcasting pearls before swine, both the Revealer and the things revealedshould be trodden under foot. Thus, the reticence of both Buddha andJesus-whether the latter lived out the historic period allotted to him ornot, and who equally abstained from revealing plainly the Mysteries of Lifeand Death-led in the one case to the blank negations of Southern Buddhism,and in the other, to the three clashing forms of the Christian Church andthe 300 sects in Protestant England alone.Theosophical Teachings as to Nature and Man  The Unity of All in AllQ. Having told me what God, the Soul and Man are not, in your views, can youinform me what they are, according to your teachings?A. In their origin and in eternity the three, like the universe and alltherein, are one with the absolute Unity, the unknowable deific essence Ispoke about some time back. We believe in no creation, but in the periodicaland consecutive appearances of the universe from the subjective onto theobjective plane of being, at regular intervals of time, covering periods ofimmense duration.Q. Can you elaborate the subject?A. Take as a first comparison and a help towards a more correct conception,the solar year, and as a second, the two halves of that year, producing eacha day and a night of six months' duration at the North Pole. Now imagine, ifyou can, instead of a Solar year of 365 days, eternity. Let the sunrepresent the universe, and the polar days and nights of six monthseach-days and nights lasting each 182 trillions and quadrillions of years,instead of 182 days each. As the sun arises every morning on our objectivehorizon out of its (to us) subjective and antipodal space, so does theUniverse emerge periodically on the plane of objectivity, issuing from thatof subjectivity-the antipodes of the former. This is the \"Cycle of Life.\"And as the sun disappears from our horizon, so does the Universe disappearat regular periods, when the \"Universal night\" sets in. The Hindus call suchalternations the \"Days and Nights of Brahm ,\" or the time of Manvantara andthat of Pralaya (dissolution). The Westerns may call them Universal Days andNights if they prefer. During the latter (the nights) All is in All; everyatom is resolved into one Homogeneity.  -oOo-Evolution and IllusionQ. But who is it that creates each time the Universe?A. No one creates it. Science would call the process evolution; thepre-Christian philosophers and the Orientalists called it emanation: we,Occultists and Theosophists, see in it the only universal and eternalreality casting a periodical reflection of itself on the infinite Spatialdepths. This reflection, which you regard as the objective materialuniverse, we consider as a temporary illusion and nothing else. That alonewhich is eternal is real.Q. At that rate, you and I are also illusions.A. As flitting personalities, today one person, tomorrow another-we are.Would you call the sudden flashes of the aurora borealis, the Northernlights, a \"reality,\" though it is as real as can be while you look at it?Certainly not; it is the cause that produces it, if permanent and eternal,which is the only reality, while the other is but a passing illusion.Page 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. All this does not explain to me how this illusion called the universeoriginates; how the conscious to be, proceeds to manifest itself from theunconsciousness that is.A. It is unconsciousness only to our finite consciousness. Verily may weparaphrase St. John and say:... and (Absolute) light (which is darkness) shineth in darkness (which isillusionary material light); and the darkness comprehendeth it not.This absolute light is also absolute and immutable law. Whether by radiationor emanation-we need not quarrel over terms-the universe passes out of itshomogeneous subjectivity onto the first plane of manifestation, of whichplanes there are seven, we are taught. With each plane it becomes more denseand material until it reaches this, our plane, on which the only worldapproximately known and understood in its physical composition by Science,is the planetary or Solar system-one sui generis, we are told.Q. What do you mean by sui generis?A. I mean that, though the fundamental law and the universal working of lawsof Nature are uniform, still our Solar system (like every other such systemin the millions of others in Cosmos) and even our Earth, has its own programof manifestations differing from the respective programs of all others. Wespeak of the inhabitants of other planets and imagine that if they are men,i.e., thinking entities, they must be as we are. The fancy of poets andpainters and sculptors never fails to represent even the angels as abeautiful copy of man-plus wings. We say that all this is an error and adelusion; because, if on this little earth alone one finds such a diversityin its flora, fauna, and mankind-from the seaweed to the cedar of Lebanon,from the jellyfish to the elephant, from the Bushman and negro to the ApolloBelvedere-alter the conditions cosmic and planetary, and there must be as aresult quite a different flora, fauna, and mankind. The same laws willfashion quite a different set of things and beings even on this our plane,including in it all our planets. How much more different then must beexternal nature in other Solar systems, and how foolish is it to judge ofother stars and worlds and human beings by our own, as physical sciencedoes!Q. But what are your data for this assertion?A. What science in general will never accept as proof-the cumulativetestimony of an endless series of Seers who have testified to this fact.Their spiritual visions, real explorations by, and through, physical andspiritual senses untrammeled by blind flesh, were systematically checked andcompared one with the other, and their nature sifted. All that was notcorroborated by unanimous and collective experience was rejected, while thatonly was recorded as established truth which, in various ages, underdifferent climes, and throughout an untold series of incessant observations,was found to agree and receive constantly further corroboration. The methodsused by our scholars and students of the psycho-spiritual sciences do notdiffer from those of students of the natural and physical sciences, as youmay see. Only our fields of research are on two different planes, and ourinstruments are made by no human hands, for which reason perchance they areonly the more reliable. The retorts, accumulators, and microscopes of thechemist and naturalist may get out of order; the telescope and theastronomer's horological instruments may get spoiled; our recordinginstruments are beyond the influence of weather or the elements.Q. And therefore you have implicit faith in them?A. Faith is a word not to be found in theosophical dictionaries: we sayknowledge based, on observation and experience. There is this difference,Page 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txthowever, that while the observation and experience of physical science leadthe Scientists to about as many \"working\" hypotheses as there are minds toevolve them, our knowledge consents to add to its lore only those factswhich have become undeniable, and which are fully and absolutelydemonstrated. We have no two beliefs or hypotheses on the same subject.Q. Is it on such data that you came to accept the strange theories we findin Esoteric Buddhism?A. Just so. These theories may be slightly incorrect in their minor details,and even faulty in their exposition by lay students; they are facts innature, nevertheless, and come nearer the truth than any scientifichypothesis.  -oOo-On The Septenary Constitution of Our PlanetQ. I understand that you describe our earth as forming part of a chain ofearths?A. We do. But the other six \"earths\" or globes, are not on the same plane ofobjectivity as our earth is; therefore we cannot see them.Q. Is that on account of the great distance?A. Not at all, for we see with our naked eye planets and even stars atimmeasurably greater distances; but it is owing to those six globes beingoutside our physical means of perception, or plane of being. It is not onlythat their material density, weight, or fabric are entirely different fromthose of our earth and the other known planets; but they are (to us) on anentirely different layer of space, so to speak; a layer not to be perceivedor felt by our physical senses. And when I say \"layer,\" please do not allowyour fancy to suggest to you layers like strata or beds laid one over theother, for this would only lead to another absurd misconception. What I meanby \"layer\" is that plane of infinite space which by its nature cannot fallunder our ordinary waking perceptions, whether mental or physical; but whichexists in nature outside of our normal mentality or consciousness, outsideof our three-dimensional space, and outside of our division of time. Each ofthe seven fundamental planes (or layers) in space-of course as a whole, asthe pure space of Locke's definition, not as our finite space-has its ownobjectivity and subjectivity, its own space and time, its own consciousnessand set of senses. But all this will be hardly comprehensible to one trainedin the modern ways of thought.Q. What do you mean by a different set of senses? Is there anything on ourhuman plane that you could bring as an illustration of what you say, just togive a clearer idea of what you may mean by this variety of senses, spaces,and respective perceptions?A. None; except, perhaps, that which for Science would be rather a handy pegon which to hang a counter argument. We have a different set of senses indreamlife, have we not? We feel, talk, hear, see, taste and function ingeneral on a different plane; the change of state of our consciousness beingevidenced by the fact that a series of acts and events embracing years, aswe think, pass ideally through our mind in one instant. Well, that extremerapidity of our mental operations in dreams, and the perfect naturalness,for the time being, of all the other functions, show us that we are on quiteanother plane. Our philosophy teaches us that, as there are sevenfundamental forces in nature, and seven planes of being, so there are sevenstates of consciousness in which man can live, think, remember and have hisbeing. To enumerate these here is impossible, and for this one has to turnto the study of Eastern metaphysics. But in these two states-the waking andthe dreaming-every ordinary mortal, from a learned philosopher down to aPage 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtpoor untutored savage, has a good proof that such states differ.Q. You do not accept, then, the well-known explanations of biology andphysiology to account for the dream state?A. We do not. We reject even the hypotheses of your psychologists,preferring the teachings of Eastern Wisdom. Believing in seven planes ofKosmic being and states of Consciousness, with regard to the Universe or theMacrocosm, we stop at the fourth plane, finding it impossible to go with anydegree of certainty beyond. But with respect to the Microcosm, or man, wespeculate freely on his seven states and principles.Q. How do you explain these?A. We find, first of all, two distinct beings in man; the spiritual and thephysical, the man who thinks, and the man who records as much of thesethoughts as he is able to assimilate. Therefore we divide him into twodistinct natures; the upper or the spiritual being, composed of threeprinciples or aspects; and the lower or the physical quaternary, composed offour-in all seven.  -oOo-The Septenary Nature of ManQ. Is it what we call Spirit and Soul, and the man of flesh?A. It is not. That is the old Platonic division. Plato was an Initiate, andtherefore could not go into forbidden details; but he who is acquainted withthe archaic doctrine finds the seven in Plato's various combinations of Souland Spirit. He regarded man as constituted of two parts-one eternal, formedof the same essence as the Absoluteness, the other mortal and corruptible,deriving its constituent parts from the minor \"created\" Gods. Man iscomposed, he shows, of (1) A mortal body, (2) An immortal principle, and (3)A \"separate mortal kind of Soul.\" It is that which we respectively call thephysical man, the Spiritual Soul or Spirit, and the animal Soul (the Nousand psuche). This is the division adopted by Paul, another Initiate, whomaintains that there is a psychical body which is sown in the corruptible(astral soul or body), and a spiritual body that is raised in incorruptiblesubstance. Even James corroborates the same by saying that the \"wisdom\" (ofour lower soul) descendeth not from the above, but is terrestrial(\"psychical,\" \"demoniacal,\" see the Greek text) while the other is heavenlywisdom. Now so plain is it that Plato and even Pythagoras, while speakingbut of three principles, give them seven separate functions, in theirvarious combinations, that if we contrast our teachings this will becomequite plain. Let us take a cursory view of these seven aspects by drawingtwo tables.Theosophical Division of the Lower QuaternarySanskrit Term Exoteric Meaning Explanation 1. Rupa, or Sthula-sarira Physical body Is the vehicle of all theother principles during life. 1. Prana Life, or Vital principle Necessary only to a, c,d, and the functions of the lower Manas, whichembrace all those limited to the (physical) brain.(c) Linga- sarira Astral Body The Double, the phantom body.Page 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txt(d) Kamarupa The seat of animal desires and passions This is the center ofthe animal man, where lies the line of demarcation which separates themortal man from the immortal entity.Theosophical Division of the Upper Imperishable TriadSanskrit Term Exoteric Meaning Explanation(e) Manas-a dual principle in its functions. Mind, Intelligence: which isthe higher human mind, whose light, or radiation links the Monad, for thelifetime, to the mortal man. The future state and the Karmic destiny of mandepend on whether Manas gravitates more downward to Kamarupa, the seat ofthe animal passions, or upwards to Buddhi, the Spiritual Ego. In the latercase, the higher consciousness of the individual Spiritual aspirations ofmind (Manas), assimilating Buddhi, are absorbed by it and form the Ego,which goes into Devachanic bliss.(f) Buddhi The Spiritual Soul The vehicle of pure universal spirit.(g) Atma Spirit One with the Absolute, as its radiation.In Mr. Sinnett's Esoteric Buddhism d, e, and f, are respectively called theAnimal, the Human, and the Spiritual Souls, which answers as well. Thoughthe principles in Esoteric Buddhism are numbered, this is, strictlyspeaking, useless. The dual Monad alone ( Atma-Buddhi) is susceptible ofbeing thought of as the two highest numbers (the sixth and seventh). As toall others, since that principle only which is predominant in man has to beconsidered as the first and foremost, no numeration is possible as a generalrule. In some men it is the higher Intelligence (Manas or the fifth) whichdominates the rest; in others the Animal Soul (Kamarupa) that reignssupreme, exhibiting the most bestial instincts, etc.  -oOo-Now what does Plato teach? He speaks of the interior man as constituted oftwo parts-one immutable and always the same, formed of the same substance asDeity, and the other mortal and corruptible. These \"two parts\" are found inour upper Triad, and the lower Quaternary (see table above, ). He explainsthat when the Soul, psuche, \"allies herself to the Nous (divine spirit orsubstance *)), she does everything aright and felicitously;\" but the case isotherwise when she attaches herself to Anoia, (folly, or the irrationalanimal Soul). Here, then, we have Manas (or the Soul in general) in its twoaspects: when attaching itself to Anoia (our Kamarupa, or the \"Animal Soul\"in Esoteric Buddhism) it runs towards entire annihilation, as far as thepersonal Ego is concerned; when allying itself to the Nous ( Atma-Buddhi) itmerges into the immortal, imperishable Ego, and then its spiritualconsciousness of the personal that was, becomes immortal.*) St. Paul calls Plato's nous 'spirit';but since this spirit is'substance', Buddhi is meant then and not Atma; philosophically speakingthis (Atma) cannot be called 'substance'. We count Atma as a human'principle' in order to not create yet more confusion. In reality it is nota 'human' but the universal absolute principle of which buddhi, thesoul-spirit, is the vehicle. [reversely translatednote from Dutch translation - editor]  -oOo-The Distinction Between Soul and SpiritQ. Do you really teach, as you are accused of doing by some Spiritualistsand French Spiritists, the annihilation of every personality?Page 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. We do not. But as this question of the duality-the individuality of theDivine Ego, and the personality of the human animal-involves that of thepossibility of the real immortal Ego appearing in Seance rooms as a\"materialized spirit,\" which we deny as already explained, our opponentshave started the nonsensical charge.Q. You have just spoken of psuche running towards its entire annihilation ifit attaches itself to Anoia. What did Plato, and do you mean by this?A. The entire annihilation of the personal consciousness, as an exceptionaland rare case, I think. The general and almost invariable rule is themerging of the personal into the individual or immortal consciousness of theEgo, a transformation or a divine transfiguration, and the entireannihilation only of the lower quaternary. Would you expect the man offlesh, or the temporary personality, his shadow, the \"astral,\" his animalinstincts and even physical life, to survive with the \"spiritual Ego\" andbecome everlasting, eternal? Naturally all this ceases to exist, either at,or soon after corporeal death. It becomes in time entirely disintegrated anddisappears from view, being annihilated as a whole.Q. Then you also reject resurrection in the flesh?A. Most decidedly we do! Why should we, who believe in the archaic esotericphilosophy of the Ancients, accept the unphilosophical speculations of thelater Christian theology, borrowed from the Egyptian and Greek exotericSystems of the Gnostics?Q. The Egyptians revered Nature-Spirits, and deified even onions: yourHindus are idolaters, to this day; the Zoroastrians worshiped, and do stillworship, the Sun; and the best Greek philosophers were either dreamers ormaterialists-witness Plato and Democritus. How can you compare!A. It may be so in your modern Christian and even Scientific catechism; itis not so for unbiased minds. The Egyptians revered the \"One-Only-One,\" asNout; and it is from this word that Anaxagoras got his denomination Nous, oras he calls it, nous autokrates , \"the Mind or Spirit Self-potent\", thearchetes kinedeos , the leading motor, or primum-mobile of all. With him theNous was God, and the logos was man, his emanation. The Nous is the spirit(whether in Kosmos or in man), and the logos, whether Universe or astralbody, the emanation of the former, the physical body being merely theanimal. Our external powers perceive phenomena; our Nous alone is able torecognize their noumena. It is the logos alone, or the noumenon, thatsurvives, because it is immortal in its very nature and essence, and thelogos in man is the Eternal Ego, that which reincarnates and lasts forever.But how can the evanescent or external shadow, the temporary clothing ofthat divine Emanation which returns to the source whence it proceeded, bethat which is raised in incorruptibility?Q. Still you can hardly escape the charge of having invented a new divisionof man's spiritual and psychic constituents; for no philosopher speaks ofthem, though you believe that Plato does.A. And I support the view. Besides Plato, there is Pythagoras, who alsofollowed the same idea.Says Plutarch:Plato and Pythagoras distribute the soul into two parts, the rational(noetic) and irrational (agnoia); that part of the soul of man which isrational is eternal; for though it be not God, yet it is the product of aneternal deity, but that part of the soul which is divested of reason(agnoia) dies.The modern term Agnostic comes from Agnosis, a cognate word. We wonder whyPage 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtMr. Huxley, the author of the word, should have connected his greatintellect with \"the soul divested of reason\" which dies? Is it theexaggerated humility of the modern materialist?Pythagoras described the Soul as a self-moving Unit (monad) composed ofthree elements, the Nous (Spirit), the phren (mind), and the thumos (life,breath or the Nephesh of the Cabalists) which three correspond to our \"Atma-buddhi,\" (higher Spirit-Soul), to Manas (the Ego), and to Kamarupa inconjunction with the lower reflection of Manas. That which the Ancient Greekphilosophers termed Soul, in general, we call Spirit, or Spiritual Soul,Buddhi, as the vehicle of Atma (the Agathon, or Plato's Supreme Deity). Thefact that Pythagoras and others state that phren and thumos are shared by uswith the brutes, proves that in this case the lower Manasic reflection(instinct) and Kamarupa (animal living passions) are meant. And as Socratesand Plato accepted the clue and followed it, if to these five, namely,Agathon (Deity or Atma), Psuche (Soul in its collective sense), Nous (Spiritor Mind), Phren (physical mind), and Thumos (Kamarupa or passions) we addthe eidolon of the Mysteries, the shadowy form or the human double, and thephysical body, it will be easy to demonstrate that the ideas of bothPythagoras and Plato were identical with ours. Even the Egyptians held tothe Septenary division. In its exit, they taught, the Soul (Ego) had to passthrough its seven chambers, or principles, those it left behind, and thoseit took along with itself. The only difference is that, ever bearing in mindthe penalty of revealing Mystery-doctrines, which was death, they gave outthe teaching in a broad outline, while we elaborate it and explain it in itsdetails. But though we do give out to the world as much as is lawful, evenin our doctrine more than one important detail is withheld, which those whostudy the esoteric philosophy and are pledged to silence, are alone entitledto know.  -oOo-The Greek TeachingsQ. We have magnificent Greek and Latin, Sanskrit and Hebrew scholars. How isit that we find nothing in their translations that would afford us a clue towhat you say?A. Because your translators, their great learning notwithstanding, have madeof the philosophers, the Greeks especially, misty instead of mystic writers.Take as an instance Plutarch, and read what he says of \"the principles\" ofman. That which he describes was accepted literally and attributed tometaphysical superstition and ignorance. Let me give you an illustration inpoint. Says Plutarch:Man is compound; and they are mistaken who think him to be compounded of twoparts only. For they imagine that the understanding (brain intellect) is apart of the soul (the upper Triad), but they err in this no less than thosewho make the soul to be a part of the body, i.e., those who make of theTriad part of the corruptible mortal quaternary. For the understanding(nous) as far exceeds the soul, as the soul is better and diviner than thebody. Now this composition of the soul ( psuche) with the understanding(nous) makes reason; and with the body (or thumos, the animal soul) passion;of which the one is the beginning or principle of pleasure and pain, and theother of virtue and vice. Of these three parts conjoined and compactedtogether, the earth has given the body, the moon the soul, and the sun theunderstanding to the generation of man.This last sentence is purely allegorical, and will be comprehended only bythose who are versed in the esoteric science of correspondences and knowwhich planet is related to every principle. Plutarch divides the latter intothree groups, and makes of the body a compound of physical frame, astralshadow, and breath, or the triple lower part, which \"from earth was takenand to earth returns\"; of the middle principle and the instinctual soul, thePage 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtsecond part, derived from and through and ever influenced by the moon; andonly of the higher part or the Spiritual Soul, with the tmic and Manasicelements in it does he make a direct emanation of the Sun, who stands herefor Agathon the Supreme Deity. This is proven by what he says further asfollows:Now of the deaths we die, the one makes man two of three and the other oneof (out of) two. The former is in the region and jurisdiction of Demeter,whence the name given to the Mysteries, telein , resembled that given todeath, teleutan. The Athenians also heretofore called the deceased sacred toDemeter. As for the other death, it is in the moon or region of Persephone.Here you have our doctrine, which shows man a septenary during life; aquintile just after death, in Kamaloka; and a threefold Ego, Spirit-Soul,and consciousness in Devachan. This separation, first in \"the Meadows ofHades,\" as Plutarch calls the Kamaloka, then in Devachan, was part andparcel of the performances during the sacred Mysteries, when the candidatesfor initiation enacted the whole drama of death, and the resurrection as aglorified spirit, by which name we mean Consciousness. This is what Plutarchmeans when he says:And as with the one, the terrestrial, so with the other celestial Hermesdoth dwell. This suddenly and with violence plucks the soul from the body;but Prospina mildly and in a long time disjoins the understanding from thesoul.(Proserpina, or Persephone, stands here for postmortem Karma, which is saidto regulate the separation of the lower from the higher principles: theSoul, as Nephesh, the breath of animal life, which remains for a time inKamaloka, from the higher compound Ego, which goes into the state ofDevachan, or bliss.)For this reason she is called Monogenes, only begotten, or rather begettingone alone; for the better part of man becomes alone when it is separated byher. Now both the one and the other happens thus according to nature. It isordained by Fate (Fatum or Karma) that every soul, whether with or withoutunderstanding (mind), when gone out of the body, should wander for a time,though not all for the same, in the region lying between the earth and moon(Kamaloka). For those that have been unjust and dissolute suffer then thepunishment due to their offenses; but the good and virtuous are theredetained till they are purified, and have, by expiation, purged out of themall the infections they might have contracted from the contagion of thebody, as if from foul health, living in the mildest part of the air, calledthe Meadows of Hades, where they must remain for a certain prefixed andappointed time. And then, as if they were returning from a wanderingpilgrimage or long exile into their country, they have a taste of joy, suchas they principally receive who are initiated into Sacred Mysteries, mixedwith trouble, admiration, and each one's proper and peculiar hope.This is Nirvanic bliss, and no Theosophist could describe in plainer thoughesoteric language the mental joys of Devachan, where every man has hisparadise around him, erected by his consciousness. But you must beware ofthe general error into which too many even of our Theosophists fall. Do notimagine that because man is called septenary, then quintuple and a triad, heis a compound of seven, five, or three entities; or, as well expressed by aTheosophical writer, of skins to be peeled off like the skins of an onion.The principles, as already said, save the body, the life, and the astraleidolon, all of which disperse at death, are simply aspects and states ofconsciousness. There is but one real man, enduring through the cycle of lifeand immortal in essence, if not in form, and this is Manas, the Mind-man orembodied Consciousness. The objection made by the materialists, who deny thepossibility of mind and consciousness acting without matter is worthless inour case. We do not deny the soundness of their argument; but we simply askour opponents,Page 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtAre you acquainted with all the states of matter, you who knew hitherto butof three? And how do you know whether that which we refer to as absoluteconsciousness or Deity forever invisible and unknowable, be not that which,though it eludes forever our human finite conception, is still universalSpirit-matter or matter-Spirit in its absolute infinitude?It is then one of the lowest, and in its manvantaric manifestationsfractioned-aspects of this Spirit-matter, which is the conscious Ego thatcreates its own paradise, a fool's paradise, it may be, still a state ofbliss.Q. But what is Devachan?A. The \"land of gods\" literally; a condition, a state of mental bliss.Philosophically a mental condition analogous to, but far more vivid and realthan, the most vivid dream. It is the state after death of most mortals.On the Various Postmortem States The Physical and the Spiritual ManQ. I am glad to hear you believe in the immortality of the Soul.A. Not of \"the Soul,\" but of the divine Spirit; or rather in the immortalityof the reincarnating Ego.Q. What is the difference?A. A very great one in our philosophy, but this is too abstruse anddifficult a question to touch lightly upon. We shall have to analyze themseparately, and then in conjunction. We may begin with Spirit.We say that the Spirit (the \"Father in secret\" of Jesus), or Atma, is noindividual property of any man, but is the Divine essence which has no body,no form, which is imponderable, invisible and indivisible, that which doesnot exist and yet is, as the Buddhists say of Nirvana. It only overshadowsthe mortal; that which enters into him and pervades the whole body beingonly its omnipresent rays, or light, radiated through Buddhi, its vehicleand direct emanation. This is the secret meaning of the assertions of almostall the ancient philosophers, when they said that \"the rational part ofman's soul\" never entered wholly into the man, but only overshadowed himmore or less through the irrational spiritual Soul or Buddhi.Buddhi is irrational in the sense that as a pure emanation of the Universalmind it can have no individual reason of its own on this plane of matter,but like the Moon, who borrows her light from the Sun and her life from theEarth, so Buddhi, receiving its light of Wisdom from Atma, gets its rationalqualities from Manas. Per se, as something homogeneous, it is devoid ofattributes.Q. I labored under the impression that the \"Animal Soul\" alone wasirrational, not the Divine.A. You have to learn the difference between that which is negatively, orpassively \"irrational,\" because undifferentiated, and that which isirrational because too active and positive. Man is a correlation ofspiritual powers, as well as a correlation of chemical and physical forces,brought into function by what we call principles.I have read a good deal upon the subject, and it seems to me that thenotions of the older philosophers differed a great deal from those of themedieval Cabalists, though they do agree in some particulars.Page 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. The most substantial difference between them and us is this. While webelieve with the Neo-Platonists and the Eastern teachings that the spirit (Atma) never descends hypostatically into the living man, but only showersmore or less its radiance on the inner man (the psychic and spiritualcompound of the astral principles), the Cabalists maintain that the humanSpirit, detaching itself from the ocean of light and Universal Spirit,enters man's Soul, where it remains throughout life imprisoned in the astralcapsule. All Christian Cabalists still maintain the same, as they are unableto break quite loose from their anthropomorphic and Biblical doctrines.Q. And what do you say?A. We say that we only allow the presence of the radiation of Spirit (orAtma) in the astral capsule, and so far only as that spiritual radiancy isconcerned. We say that man and Soul have to conquer their immortality byascending towards the unity with which, if successful, they will be finallylinked and into which they are finally, so to speak, absorbed. Theindividualization of man after death depends on the spirit, not on his souland body. Although the word personality, in the sense in which it is usuallyunderstood, is an absurdity if applied literally to our immortal essence,still the latter is, as our individual Ego, a distinct entity, immortal andeternal, per se. It is only in the case of black magicians or of criminalsbeyond redemption, criminals who have been such during a long series oflives-that the shining thread, which links the spirit to the personal soulfrom the moment of the birth of the child, is violently snapped, and thedisembodied entity becomes divorced from the personal soul, the latter beingannihilated without leaving the smallest impression of itself on the former.If that union between the lower, or personal Manas, and the individualreincarnating Ego, has not been effected during life, then the former isleft to share the fate of the lower animals, to gradually dissolve intoether, and have its personality annihilated. But even then the Ego remains adistinct being. It (the spiritual Ego) only loses one Devachanic state-afterthat special, and in that case indeed useless, life-as that idealizedPersonality, and is reincarnated, after enjoying for a short time itsfreedom as a planetary spirit almost immediately.Q. It is stated in Isis Unveiled that such planetary Spirits or Angels, \"thegods of the Pagans or the Archangels of the Christians,\" will never be menon our planet.A. Quite right. Not \"such,\" but some classes of higher Planetary Spirits.They will never be men on this planet, because they are liberated Spiritsfrom a previous, earlier world, and as such they cannot rebecome men on thisone. Yet all these will live again in the next and far higherMaha-Manvantara, after this \"great Age,\" and \"Brahma pralaya,\" (a littleperiod of 16 figures or so) is over. For you must have heard, of course,that Eastern philosophy teaches us that mankind consists of such \"Spirits\"imprisoned in human bodies? The difference between animals and men is this:the former are ensouled by the principles potentially, the latter actually.Do you understand now the difference?Q. Yes; but this specialization has been in all ages the stumbling-block ofmetaphysicians.A. It was. The whole esotericism of the Buddhist philosophy is based on thismysterious teaching, understood by so few persons, and so totallymisrepresented by many of the most learned modern scholars. Evenmetaphysicians are too inclined to confound the effect with the cause. AnEgo who has won his immortal life as spirit will remain the same inner selfthroughout all his rebirths on earth; but this does not imply necessarilythat he must either remain the Mr. Smith or Mr. Brown he was on earth, orlose his individuality. Therefore, the astral soul and the terrestrial bodyof man may, in the dark hereafter, be absorbed into the cosmical ocean ofsublimated elements, and cease to feel his last personal Ego (if it did notPage 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtdeserve to soar higher), and the divine Ego still remain the same unchangedentity, though this terrestrial experience of his emanation may be totallyobliterated at the instant of separation from the unworthy vehicle.Q. If the \"Spirit,\" or the divine portion of the soul, is preexistent as adistinct being from all eternity, as Origen, Synesius, and othersemi-Christians and semi-Platonic philosophers taught, and if it is thesame, and nothing more than the metaphysically-objective soul, how can it beotherwise than eternal? And what matters it in such a case, whether manleads a pure life or an animal, if, do what he may, he can never lose hisindividuality?A. This doctrine, as you have stated it, is just as pernicious in itsconsequences as that of vicarious atonement. Had the latter dogma, incompany with the false idea that we are all immortal, been demonstrated tothe world in its true light, humanity would have been bettered by itspropagation.Let me repeat to you again. Pythagoras, Plato, Timaeus of Locris, and theold Alexandrian School, derived the Soul of man (or his higher principlesand attributes) from the Universal World Soul, the latter being, accordingto their teachings, Aether (Pater-Zeus). Therefore, neither of theseprinciples can be unalloyed essence of the Pythagorean Monas, or ourAtma-Buddhi, because the Anima Mundi is but the effect, the subjectiveemanation or rather radiation of the former. Both the human Spirit (or theindividuality), the reincarnating Spiritual Ego, and Buddhi, the Spiritualsoul, are preexistent. But, while the former exists as a distinct entity, anindividualization, the soul exists as preexisting breath, an unscient[lacking in knowledge] portion of an intelligent whole. Both were originallyformed from the Eternal Ocean of light; but as the Fire-Philosophers, themedieval Theosophists, expressed it, there is a visible as well as invisiblespirit in fire. They made a difference between the anima bruta and the animadivina. Empedocles firmly believed all men and animals to possess two souls;and in Aristotle we find that he calls one the reasoning soul,nous , and theother, the animal soul, psuche . According to these philosophers, thereasoning soul comes from within the universal soul, and the other fromwithout.Q. Would you call the Soul, i.e., the human thinking Soul, or what you callthe Ego-matter?A. Not matter, but substance assuredly; nor would the word matter, ifprefixed with the adjective, primordial, be a word to avoid. That matter, wesay, is coeternal with Spirit, and is not our visible, tangible, anddivisible matter, but its extreme sublimation. Pure Spirit is but one removefrom the no-Spirit, or the absolute all. Unless you admit that man wasevolved out of this primordial Spirit-matter, and represents a regularprogressive scale of principles from meta-Spirit down to the grossestmatter, how can we ever come to regard the inner man as immortal, and at thesame time as a spiritual Entity and a mortal man?Q. Then why should you not believe in God as such an Entity?A. Because that which is infinite and unconditioned can have no form, andcannot be a being, not in any Eastern philosophy worthy of the name, at anyrate. An \"entity\" is immortal, but is so only in its ultimate essence, notin its individual form. When at the last point of its cycle, it is absorbedinto its primordial nature; and it becomes spirit, when it loses its name ofEntity.Its immortality as a form is limited only to its life cycle or the Maha-Manvantara; after which it is one and identical with the Universal Spirit,and no longer a separate Entity. As to the personal Soul-by which we meanthe spark of consciousness that preserves in the Spiritual Ego the idea ofPage 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtthe personal \"I\" of the last incarnation-this lasts, as a separate distinctrecollection, only throughout the Devachanic period; after which time it isadded to the series of other innumerable incarnations of the Ego, like theremembrance in our memory of one of a series of days, at the end of a year.Will you bind the infinitude you claim for your God to finite conditions?That alone which is indissolubly cemented by Atma (i.e., Buddhi-Manas) isimmortal. The Soul of man (i.e., of the personality) per se is neitherimmortal, eternal nor divine. Says The Zohar:The soul, when sent to this earth, puts on an earthly garment, to preserveherself here, so she receives above a shining garment, in order to be ableto look without injury into the mirror, whose light proceeds from the Lordof Light.Moreover, The Zohar teaches that the soul cannot reach the abode of bliss,unless she has received the \"holy kiss,\" or the reunion of the soul with thesubstance from which she emanated-spirit. All souls are dual, and, while thelatter is a feminine principle, the spirit is masculine. While imprisoned inbody, man is a trinity, unless his pollution is such as to have caused hisdivorce from the spirit. \"Woe to the soul which prefers to her divinehusband (spirit) the earthly wedlock with her terrestrial body,\" records atext of The Book of the Keys, a Hermetic work. Woe indeed, for nothing willremain of that personality to be recorded on the imperishable tablets of theEgo's memory.Q. How can that which, if not breathed by God into man, yet is on your ownconfession of an identical substance with the divine, fail to be immortal?A. Every atom and speck of matter, not of substance only, is imperishable inits essence, but not in its individual consciousness. Immortality is butone's unbroken consciousness; and the personal consciousness can hardly lastlonger than the personality itself, can it? And such consciousness, as Ialready told you, survives only throughout Devachan, after which it isreabsorbed, first, in the individual, and then in the universalconsciousness. Better enquire of your theologians how it is that they haveso sorely jumbled up the Jewish Scriptures. Read the Bible, if you wouldhave a good proof that the writers of the Pentateuch, and Genesisespecially, never regarded nephesh, that which God breathes into Adam, asthe immortal soul. Here are some instances: \"And God created ... every nephesh(life) that moveth,\" meaning animals; and it is said: \"And man became anephesh\" (living soul), which shows that the word nephesh was indifferentlyapplied to immortal man and to mortal beast. \"And surely your blood of yournepheshim (lives) will I require; at the hand of every beast will I requireit, and at the hand of man,\" \"Escape for nephesh\" (escape for thy life, itis translated). \"Let us not kill him,\" reads the English version. \"Let usnot kill his nephesh,\" is the Hebrew text. \"Nephesh for nephesh,\" saysLeviticus. \"He that killeth any man shall surely be put to death,\" literally\"He that smiteth the nephesh of a man;\" and from verse 18 and following itreads: \"And he that killeth a beast (nephesh) shall make it good ... Beast forbeast,\" whereas the original text has it \"nephesh for nephesh.\" How couldman kill that which is immortal? And this explains also why the Sadduceesdenied the immortality of the soul, as it also affords another proof thatvery probably the Mosaic Jews-the uninitiated at any rate-never believed inthe soul's survival at all.  -oOo-On Eternal Reward and Punishment, and on NirvanaQ. It is hardly necessary, I suppose, to ask you whether you believe in theChristian dogmas of Paradise and Hell, or in future rewards and punishmentsas taught by the Orthodox churches?A. As described in your catechisms, we reject them absolutely; least of allPage 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtwould we accept their eternity. But we believe firmly in what we call theLaw of Retribution, and in the absolute justice and wisdom guiding this Law,or Karma. Hence we positively refuse to accept the cruel and unphilosophicalbelief in eternal reward or eternal punishment. We say with Horace:Let rules be fixed that may our rage contain,And punish faults with a proportioned pain;But do not flay him who deserves aloneA whipping for the fault that he has done.This is a rule for all men, and a just one. Have we to believe that God, ofwhom you make the embodiment of wisdom, love and mercy, is less entitled tothese attributes than mortal man?Q. Have you any other reasons for rejecting this dogma?A. Our chief reason for it lies in the fact of reincarnation. As alreadystated, we reject the idea of a new soul created for every newly-born babe.We believe that every human being is the bearer, or Vehicle, of an Egocoeval with every other Ego; because all Egos are of the same essence andbelong to the primeval emanation from one universal infinite Ego. Platocalls the latter the logos (or the second manifested God); and we, themanifested divine principle, which is one with the universal mind or soul,not the anthropomorphic, extra-cosmic and personal God in which so manyTheists believe. Pray do not confuse.Q. But where is the difficulty, once you accept a manifested principle, inbelieving that the soul of every new mortal is created by that Principle, asall the Souls before it have been so created?A. Because that which is impersonal can hardly create, plan and think, atits own sweet will and pleasure. Being a universal Law, immutable in itsperiodical manifestations, those of radiating and manifesting its ownessence at the beginning of every new cycle of life, it is not supposed tocreate men, only to repent a few years later of having created them. If wehave to believe in a divine principle at all, it must be in one which is asabsolute harmony, logic, and justice, as it is absolute love, wisdom, andimpartiality; and a God who would create every soul for the space of onebrief span of life, regardless of the fact whether it has to animate thebody of a wealthy, happy man, or that of a poor suffering wretch, haplessfrom birth to death though he has done nothing to deserve his cruelfate-would be rather a senseless fiend than a God. Why, even the Jewishphilosophers, believers in the Mosaic Bible (esoterically, of course), havenever entertained such an idea; and, moreover, they believed inreincarnation, as we do.Q. Can you give me some instances as a proof of this?A. Most decidedly I can. Philo Judaeus says:The air is full of them (of souls); those which are nearest the earth,descending to be tied to mortal bodies, palindromousi authis , return toother bodies, being desirous to live in them.In The Zohar, the soul is made to plead her freedom before God:Lord of the Universe! I am happy in this world, and do not wish to go intoanother world, where I shall be a handmaid, and be exposed to all kinds ofpollution.The doctrine of fatal necessity, the everlasting immutable law, is assertedPage 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtin the answer of the Deity: \"Against thy will thou becomest an embryo, andagainst thy will thou art born.\" Light would be incomprehensible withoutdarkness to make it manifest by contrast; good would be no longer goodwithout evil to show the priceless nature of the boon; and so personalvirtue could claim no merit, unless it had passed through the furnace oftemptation. Nothing is eternal and unchangeable, save the concealed Deity.Nothing that is finite-whether because it had a beginning, or must have anend-can remain stationary. It must either progress or recede; and a soulwhich thirsts after a reunion with its spirit, which alone confers upon itimmortality, must purify itself through cyclic transmigrations onward towardthe only land of bliss and eternal rest, called in The Zohar, \"The Palace ofLove,\" ; in the Hindu religion, \"Moksha\"; among the Gnostics, \"The Pleromaof Eternal Light\"; and by the Buddhists, \"Nirvana.\" And all these states aretemporary, not eternal.Q. Yet there is no reincarnation spoken of in all this.A. A soul which pleads to be allowed to remain where she is, must bepreexistent, and not have been created for the occasion. In The Zohar,however, there is a still better proof. Speaking of the reincarnating Egos(the rational souls), those whose last personality has to fade out entirely,it is said:All souls which have alienated themselves in heaven from the HolyOne-blessed be His Name-have thrown themselves into an abyss at their veryexistence, and have anticipated the time when they are to descend once moreon earth.\"The Holy One\" means here, esoterically, the Atma, or Atma-Buddhi.Q. Moreover, it is very strange to find Nirvana spoken of as somethingsynonymous with the Kingdom of Heaven, or the Paradise, since according toevery Orientalist of note Nirvana is a synonym of annihilation!A. Taken literally, with regard to the personality and differentiatedmatter, not otherwise. These ideas on reincarnation and the trinity of manwere held by many of the early Christian Fathers. It is the jumble made bythe translators of the New Testament and ancient philosophical treatisesbetween soul and spirit, that has occasioned the many misunderstandings. Itis also one of the many reasons why Buddha, Plotinus, and so many otherInitiates are now accused of having longed for the total extinction of theirsouls-\"absorption unto the Deity,\" or \"reunion with the universal soul,\"meaning, according to modern ideas, annihilation. The personal soul must, ofcourse, be disintegrated into its particles, before it is able to link itspurer essence forever with the immortal spirit. But the translators of boththe Acts and the Epistles, who laid the foundation of the Kingdom of Heaven,and the modern commentators on the Buddhist Sutra of the Foundation of theKingdom of Righteousness, have muddled the sense of the great apostle ofChristianity as of the great reformer of India. The former have smotheredthe word psuchikos , so that no reader imagines it to have any relation withsoul; and with this confusion of soul and spirit together, Bible readers getonly a perverted sense of anything on the subject. On the other hand, theinterpreters of Buddha have failed to understand the meaning and object ofthe Buddhist four degrees of Dhyana. Ask the Pythagoreans, \"Can that spirit,which gives life and motion and partakes of the nature of light, be reducedto nonentity?\" \"Can even that sensitive spirit in brutes which exercisesmemory, one of the rational faculties, die and become nothing?\" observe theOccultists. In Buddhist philosophy annihilation means only a dispersion ofmatter, in whatever form or semblance of form it may be, for everything thathas form is temporary, and is, therefore, really an illusion. For ineternity the longest periods of time are as a wink of the eye. So with form.Before we have time to realize that we have seen it, it is gone like aninstantaneous flash of lightning, and passed forever. When the Spiritualentity breaks loose forever from every particle of matter, substance, orPage 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtform, and rebecomes a Spiritual breath: then only does it enter upon theeternal and unchangeable Nirvana, lasting as long as the cycle of life haslasted-an eternity, truly. And then that Breath, existing in Spirit, isnothing because it is all; as a form, a semblance, a shape, it is completelyannihilated; as absolute Spirit it still is, for it has become Be-nessitself. The very word used, \"absorbed in the universal essence,\" when spokenof the \"Soul\" as Spirit, means \"union with.\" It can never mean annihilation,as that would mean eternal separation.Q. Do you not lay yourself open to the accusation of preaching annihilationby the language you yourself use? You have just spoken of the Soul of manreturning to its primordial elements.A. But you forget that I have given you the differences between the variousmeanings of the word Soul, and shown the loose way in which the term Spirithas been hitherto translated. We speak of an animal, a human, and aspiritual, Soul, and distinguish between them. Plato, for instance, calls\"rational Soul\" that which we call Buddhi, adding to it the adjective of\"spiritual,\" however; but that which we call the reincarnating Ego, Manas,he calls Spirit, Nous, etc., whereas we apply the term Spirit, when standingalone and without any qualification, to Atma alone. Pythagoras repeats ourarchaic doctrine when stating that the Ego (Nous) is eternal with Deity;that the soul only passed through various stages to arrive at divineexcellence; while thumos returned to the earth, and even the phren, thelower Manas, was eliminated. Again, Plato defines Soul (Buddhi) as \"themotion that is able to move itself.\" \"Soul,\" he adds (Laws X.), \"is the mostancient of all things, and the commencement of motion,\" thus callingAtma-Buddhi \"Soul,\" and Manas \"Spirit,\" which we do not.Soul was generated prior to body, and body is posterior and secondary, asbeing according to nature, ruled over by the ruling soul. The soul whichadministers all things that are moved in every way, administers likewise theheavens.Soul then leads everything in heaven, and on earth, and in the sea, by itsmovements-the names of which are, to will, to consider to take care of, toconsult. to form opinions true and false, to be in a state of joy, sorrow,confidence, fear, hate, love, together with all such primary movements asare allied to these ... Being a goddess herself, she ever takes as an allyNous, a god, and disciplines all things correctly and happily; but when withAnnoia-not nous-it works out everything the contrary.In this language, as in the Buddhist texts, the negative is treated asessential existence. Annihilation comes under a similar exegesis. Thepositive state is essential being, but no manifestation as such. When thespirit, in Buddhist parlance, enters Nirvana, it loses objective existence,but retains subjective being. To objective minds this is becoming absolute\"nothing\"; to subjective, No-thing, nothing to be displayed to sense. Thus,their Nirvana means the certitude of individual immortality in Spirit, notin Soul, which, though \"the most ancient of all things,\" is still-along withall the other Gods-a finite emanation, in forms and individuality, if not insubstance.Q. I do not quite seize the idea yet, and would be thankful to have youexplain this to me by some illustrations.A. No doubt it is very difficult to understand, especially to one brought upin the regular orthodox ideas of the Christian Church. Moreover, I must tellyou one. thing; and this is that unless you have studied thoroughly well theseparate functions assigned to all the human principles and the state of allthese after death, you will hardly realize our Eastern philosophy.  -oOo-Page 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtOn the Various Principles in ManQ. I have heard a good deal about this constitution of the \"inner man\" asyou call it, but could never make \"head or tail on't\" as Gabalis expressesit.A. Of course, it is most difficult, and, as you say, \"puzzling\" tounderstand correctly and distinguish between the various aspects, called byus the principles of the real Ego. It is the more so as there exists anotable difference in the numbering of those principles by various Easternschools, though at the bottom there is the same identical substratum ofteaching.Q. Do you mean the Vedantins, as an instance? Don't they divide your sevenprinciples into five only? 1. They do; but though I would not presume to dispute the point with a learned Vedantin, I may yet state as my private opinion that they have an obvious reason for it. With them it is only that compound spiritual aggregate which consists of various mental aspects that is called Man at all, the physical body being in their view something beneath contempt, and merely an illusion. Nor is the Vedanta the only philosophy to reckon in this manner. Lao-tzu, in his Tao Te Ching, mentions only five principles, because he, like the Vedantins, omits to include two principles, namely, the spirit ( Atma) and the physical body, the latter of which, moreover, he calls \"the cadaver.\" Then there is the Taraka Raja-Yoga School. Its teaching recognizes only three principles in fact; but then, in reality, their Sthulopadhi, or the physical body, in its waking conscious state, their Sukshmopadhi, the same body in Svapna, or the dreaming state, and their Karanopadhi or \"causal body,\" or that which passes from one incarnation to another, are all dual in their aspects, and thus make six. Add to this Atma, the impersonal divine principle or the immortal element in Man, undistinguished from the Universal Spirit, and you have the same seven again. They are welcome to hold to their division; we hold to ours.[See 'Secret Doctrine', part 1, p. 182 for a clearer exposition]Q. Then it seems almost the same as the division made by the mysticChristians: body, soul, and spirit?A. Just the same. We could easily make of the body the vehicle of the \"vitalDouble\"; of the latter the vehicle of Life or Prana; of Kamarupa, or(animal) soul, the vehicle of the higher and the lower mind, and make ofthis six principles, crowning the whole with the one immortal spirit. InOccultism every qualitative change in the state of our consciousness givesto man a new aspect, and if it prevails and becomes part of the living andacting Ego, it must be (and is) given a special name, to distinguish the manin that particular state from the man he is when he places himself inanother state.Q. It is just that which it is so difficult to understand.A. It seems to me very easy, on the contrary, once that you have seized themain idea, i.e., that man acts on this or another plane of consciousness, instrict accordance with his mental and spiritual condition. But such is thematerialism of the age that the more we explain the less people seem capableof understanding what we say. Divide the terrestrial being called man intothree chief aspects, if you like, and unless you make of him a pure animalyou cannot do less. Take his objective body; the thinking principle inhim-which is only a little higher than the instinctual element in theanimal-or the vital conscious soul; and that which places him soimmeasurably beyond and higher than the animal-i.e., his reasoning soul or\"spirit.\" Well, if we take these three groups or representative entities,Page 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtand subdivide them, according to the occult teaching, what do we get?First of all, Spirit (in the sense of the Absolute, and therefore,indivisible All), or Atma. As this can neither be located nor limited inphilosophy, being simply that which is in Eternity, and which cannot beabsent from even the tiniest geometrical or mathematical point of theuniverse of matter or substance, it ought not to be called, in truth, a\"human\" principle at all. Rather, and at best, it is in Metaphysics, thatpoint in space which the human Monad and its vehicle man occupy for theperiod of every life. Now that point is as imaginary as man himself, and inreality is an illusion, a Maya ; but then for ourselves, as for otherpersonal Egos, we are a reality during that fit of illusion called life, andwe have to take ourselves into account, in our own fancy at any rate, if noone else does. To make it more conceivable to the human intellect, whenfirst attempting the study of Occultism, and to solve the a-b-c of themystery of man, Occultism calls this seventh principle the synthesis of thesixth, and gives it for vehicle the Spiritual Soul, Buddhi. Now the latterconceals a mystery, which is never given to any one, with the exception ofirrevocably pledged Chelas, or those, at any rate, who can be safelytrusted. Of course, there would be less confusion, could it only be told;but, as this is directly concerned with the power of projecting one's doubleconsciously and at will, and as this gift, like the \"ring of Gyges,\" wouldprove very fatal to man at large and to the possessor of that faculty inparticular, it is carefully guarded. But let us proceed with the principles.This divine soul, or Buddhi, then, is the vehicle of the Spirit. Inconjunction, these two are one, impersonal and without any attributes (onthis plane, of course), and make two spiritual principles. If we pass ontothe Human Soul, Manas or mens, everyone will agree that the intelligence ofman is dual to say the least: e.g., the high-minded man can hardly becomelow-minded; the very intellectual and spiritual-minded man is separated byan abyss from the obtuse, dull, and material, if not animal-minded man.Q. But why should not man be represented by two principles or two aspects,rather?A. Every man has these two principles in him, one more active than theother, and in rare cases, one of these is entirely stunted in its growth, soto say, or paralysed by the strength and predominance of the other aspect,in whatever direction. These, then, are what we call the two principles oraspects of Manas, the higher and the lower; the former, the higher Manas, orthe thinking, conscious Ego gravitating toward the spiritual Soul (Buddhi);and the latter, or its instinctual principle, attracted to Kama, the seat ofanimal desires and passions in man. Thus, we have four principles justified;the last three being (1) the \"Double,\" which we have agreed to call Protean,or Plastic Soul; the vehicle of (2) the life principle; and (3) the physicalbody. Of course no physiologist or biologist will accept these principles,nor can he make head or tail of them. And this is why, perhaps, none of themunderstand to this day either the functions of the spleen, the physicalvehicle of the Protean Double, or those of a certain organ on the right sideof man, the seat of the above-mentioned desires, nor yet does he knowanything of the pineal gland, which he describes as a horny gland with alittle sand in it, which gland is in truth the very seat of the highest anddivinest consciousness in man, his omniscient, spiritual and all-embracingmind. And this shows to you still more plainly that we have neither inventedthese seven principles, nor are they new in the world of philosophy, as wecan easily prove.Q. But what is it that reincarnates, in your belief?A. The Spiritual thinking Ego, the permanent principle in man, or that whichis the seat of Manas. It is not Atma, or even Atma-Buddhi, regarded as thedual Monad, which is the individual, or divine man, but Manas; for Atma isthe Universal All, and becomes the Higher-Self of man only in conjunctionwith Buddhi, its vehicle, which links it to the individuality (or divinePage 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtman). For it is the Buddhi-Manas which is called the Causal body, (theUnited fifth and sixth Principles) and which is Consciousness, that connectsit with every personality it inhabits on earth. Therefore, Soul being ageneric term, there are in men three aspects of Soul-the terrestrial, oranimal; the Human Soul; and the Spiritual Soul; these, strictly speaking,are one Soul in its three aspects. Now of the first aspect, nothing remainsafter death; of the second (nous or Manas) only its divine essence if leftunsoiled survives, while the third in addition to being immortal becomesconsciously divine, by the assimilation of the higher Manas. But to make itclear, we have to say a few words first of all about Reincarnation.Q. You will do well, as it is against this doctrine that your enemies fightthe most ferociously.A. You mean the Spiritualists? I know; and many are the absurd objectionslaboriously spun by them over the pages of Light. So obtuse and maliciousare some of them, that they will stop at nothing. One of them found recentlya contradiction, which he gravely discusses in a letter to that journal, intwo statements picked out of Mr. Sinnett's lectures. He discovers that gravecontradiction in these two sentences: \"Premature returns to earth-life inthe cases when they occur may be due to Karmic complication ... \"; and \"thereis no accident in the supreme act of divine justice guiding evolution.\" Soprofound a thinker would surely see a contradiction of the law ofgravitation if a man stretched out his hand to stop a falling stone fromcrushing the head of a child!On Reincarnation or Rebirth What is Memory According to Theosophical Teaching?Q. The most difficult thing for you to do, will be to explain and givereasonable grounds for such a belief. No Theosophist has ever yet succeededin bringing forward a single valid proof to shake my skepticism. First ofall, you have against this theory of reincarnation, the fact that no singleman has yet been found to remember that he has lived, least of all who hewas, during his previous life.A. Your argument, I see, tends to the same old objection; the loss of memoryin each of us of our previous incarnation. You think it invalidates ourdoctrine? My answer is that it does not, and that at any rate such anobjection cannot be final.Q. I would like to hear your arguments.A. They are short and few. Yet when you take into consideration (a) theutter inability of the best modern psychologists to explain to the world thenature of mind; and (b) their complete ignorance of its potentialities, andhigher states, you have to admit that this objection is based on an a prioriconclusion drawn from prima facie and circumstantial evidence more thananything else. Now what is \"memory\" in your conception, pray?Q. That which is generally accepted: the faculty in our mind of rememberingand of retaining the knowledge of previous thoughts, deeds, and events.A. Please add to it that there is a great difference between the threeaccepted forms of memory. Besides memory in general you have Remembrance,Recollection, and Reminiscence, have you not? Have you ever thought over thedifference? Memory, remember, is a generic name.Q. Yet, all these are only synonyms.A. Indeed, they are not-not in philosophy, at all events. Memory is simplyan innate power in thinking beings, and even in animals, of reproducing pastimpressions by an association of ideas principally suggested by objectivePage 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtthings or by some action on our external sensory organs. Memory is a facultydepending entirely on the more or less healthy and normal functioning of ourphysical brain; and remembrance and recollection are the attributes andhandmaidens of that memory. But reminiscence is an entirely different thing.Reminiscence is defined by the modern psychologist as something intermediatebetween remembrance and recollection, or \"a conscious process of recallingpast occurrences, but without that full and varied reference to particularthings which characterizes recollection.\" Locke, speaking of recollectionand remembrance, says:When an idea again recurs without the operation of the like object on theexternal sensory, it is remembrance; if it be sought after by the mind, andwith pain and endeavor found and brought again into view, it isrecollection.But even Locke leaves reminiscence without any clear definition, because itis no faculty or attribute of our physical memory, but an intuitionalperception apart from and outside our physical brain; a perception which,covering as it does (being called into action by the ever-present knowledgeof our spiritual Ego) all those visions in man which are regarded asabnormal-from the pictures suggested by genius to the ravings of fever andeven madness-are classed by science as having no existence outside of ourfancy. Occultism and Theosophy, however, regard reminiscence in an entirelydifferent light. For us, while memory is physical and evanescent and dependson the physiological conditions of the brain-a fundamental proposition withall teachers of mnemonics, who have the researches of modern scientificpsychologists to back them-we call reminiscence the memory of the soul. Andit is this memory which gives the assurance to almost every human being,whether he understands it or not, of his having lived before and having tolive again. Indeed, as Wordsworth has it:Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting,The soul that rises with us, our life's star,Hath elsewhere had its setting,And cometh from afar.Q. If it is on this kind of memory-poetry and abnormal fancies, on your ownconfession-that you base your doctrine, then you will convince very few, Iam afraid.A. I did not \"confess\" it was a fancy. I simply said that physiologists andscientists in general regard such reminiscences as hallucinations and fancy,to which learned conclusion they are welcome. We do not deny that suchvisions of the past and glimpses far back into the corridors of time, arenot abnormal, as contrasted with our normal daily life experience andphysical memory. But we do maintain with Professor W. Knight, that: Theabsence of memory of any action done in a previous state cannot be aconclusive argument against our having lived through it.And every fair-minded opponent must agree with what is said in Butler'sLectures on Platonic Philosophy:That the feeling of extravagance with which it (preexistence) affects us hasits secret source in materialistic or semi-materialistic prejudices.Besides which we maintain that memory, as Olympiodorus called it, is simplyfantasy, and the most unreliable thing in us.Say Olympiodorus, in Platonis Phaed.:The fantasy is an impediment to our intellectual conceptions; and hence,Page 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtwhen we are agitated by the inspiring influence of the Divinity, if thefantasy intervenes, the enthusiastic energy ceases: for enthusiasm and theecstasy are contrary to each other. Should it be asked whether the soul isable to energize without the fantasy, we reply, that its perception ofuniversals proves that it is able. It has perceptions, therefore,independent of the fantasy; at the same time, however, the fantasy attendsin its energies, just as a storm pursues him who sails on the sea.Ammonius Saccas asserted that the only faculty in man directly opposed toprognostication, or looking into futurity, is memory. Furthermore, rememberthat memory is one thing and mind or thought is another; one is a recordingmachine, a register which very easily gets out of order; the other(thoughts) are eternal and imperishable. Would you refuse to believe in theexistence of certain things or men only because your physical eyes have notseen them? Would not the collective testimony of past generations who haveseen him be a sufficient guarantee that Julius Caesar once lived? Why shouldnot the same testimony of the psychic senses of the masses be taken intoconsideration ?Q. But don't you think that these are too fine distinctions to be acceptedby the majority of mortals?A. Say rather by the majority of materialists. And to them we say, behold:even in the short span of ordinary existence, memory is too weak to registerall the events of a lifetime. How frequently do even most important eventslie dormant in our memory until awakened by some association of ideas, oraroused to function and activity by some other link. This is especially thecase with people of advanced age, who are always found suffering fromfeebleness of recollection. When, therefore, we remember that which we knowabout the physical and the spiritual principles in man, it is not the factthat our memory has failed to record our precedent life and lives that oughtto surprise us, but the contrary, were it to happen.  -oOo-Why Do We Not Remember Our Past Lives?Q. You have given me a bird's eye view of the seven principles; now how dothey account for our complete loss of any recollection of having livedbefore?A. Very easily. Since those principles which we call physical, and none ofwhich is denied by science, though it calls them by other names-namely, thebody, life, passional and animal instincts, and the astral eidolon of everyman (whether perceived in thought or our mind's eye, or objectively andseparate from the physical body), which principles we call Sthula-sharira,Prana, Kamarupa, and Linga-sharira (see above).[Those principles] are disintegrated after death with their constituentelements, memory along with its brain, this vanished memory of a vanishedpersonality, can neither remember nor record anything in the subsequentreincarnation of the Ego. Reincarnation means that this Ego will befurnished with a new body, a new brain, and a new memory. Therefore it wouldbe as absurd to expect this memory to remember that which it has neverrecorded as it would be idle to examine under a microscope a shirt neverworn by a murderer, and seek on it for the stains of blood which are to befound only on the clothes he wore. It is not the clean shirt that we have toquestion, but the clothes worn during the perpetration of the crime; and ifthese are burnt and destroyed, how can you get at them?Q. Aye! How can you get at the certainty that the crime was ever committedat all, or that the \"man in the clean shirt\" ever lived before?A. Not by physical processes, most assuredly; nor by relying on thePage 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txttestimony of that which exists no longer. But there is such a thing ascircumstantial evidence, since our wise laws accept it, more, perhaps, eventhan they should. To get convinced of the fact of reincarnation and pastlives, one must put oneself in rapport with one's real permanent Ego, notone's evanescent memory.Q. But how can people believe in that which they do not know, nor have everseen, far less put themselves in rapport with it?A. If people, and the most learned, will believe in the Gravity, Ether,Force, and what not of Science, abstractions \"and working hypotheses,\" whichthey have neither seen, touched, smelt, heard, nor tasted-why should notother people believe, on the same principle, in one's permanent Ego, a farmore logical and important \"working hypothesis\" than any other?Q. What is, finally, this mysterious eternal principle? Can you explain itsnature so as to make it comprehensible to all?A. The Ego which reincarnates, the individual and immortal-not personal-\"I\";the vehicle, in short, of the Atma-Buddhic Monad, that which is rewarded inDevachan and punished on earth, and that, finally, to which the reflectiononly of the Skandhas, or attributes, of every incarnation attaches itself.There are five Skandhas or attributes in the Buddhist teachings: Rupa (formor body), material qualities; Vedana , sensation; Sanna , abstract ideas;Samkhara, tendencies of mind; Vinnana, mental powers. Of these we areformed, by them we are conscious of existence; and through them communicatewith the world about us.Q. What do you mean by Skandhas?A. Just what I said: \"attributes,\" among which is memory, all of whichperish like a flower, leaving behind them only a feeble perfume. Here isanother paragraph from H.S. Olcott's Buddhist Catechism which bears directlyupon the subject. It deals with the question as follows:The aged man remembers the incidents of his youth, despite his beingphysically and mentally changed. Why, then, is not the recollection of pastlives brought over by us from our last birth into the present birth? Becausememory is included within the Skandhas, and the Skandhas having changed withthe new existence, a memory, the record of that particular existence,develops. Yet the record or reflection of all the past lives must survive,for when Prince Siddh rtha became Buddha, the full sequence of His previousbirths were seen by Him ... and any one who attains to the state of Jñana canthus retrospectively trace the line of his lives.This proves to you that while the undying qualities of the personality-suchas love, goodness, charity, etc.-attach themselves to the immortal Ego,photographing on it, so to speak, a permanent image of the divine aspect ofthe man who was, his material Skandhas (those which generate the most markedKarmic effects) are as evanescent as a flash of lightning, and cannotimpress the new brain of the new personality; yet their failing to do soimpairs in no way the identity of the reincarnating Ego.Q. Do you mean to infer that which survives is only the Soul-memory, as youcall it, that Soul or Ego being one and the same, while nothing of thepersonality remains?A. Not quite; something of each personality, unless the latter was anabsolute materialist with not even a chink in his nature for a spiritual rayto pass through, must survive, as it leaves its eternal impress on theincarnating permanent Self or Spiritual Ego. (Or the Spiritual, incontradistinction to the personal Self. The student must not confuse thisSpiritual Ego with the \"higher self\" which is Atma, the God within us, andPage 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtinseparable from the Universal Spirit.)The personality with its Skandhas is ever changing with every new birth. Itis, as said before, only the part played by the actor (the true Ego) for onenight. This is why we preserve no memory on the physical plane of our pastlives, though the real \"Ego\" has lived them over and knows them all.Q. Then how does it happen that the real or Spiritual man does not impresshis new personal \"I\" with this knowledge?A. How is it that the servant-girls in a poor farmhouse could speak Hebrewand play the violin in their trance or somnambular state, and knew neitherwhen in their normal condition? Because, as every genuine psychologist ofthe old, not your modern, school, will tell you, the Spiritual Ego can actonly when the personal Ego is paralyzed. The Spiritual \"I\" in man isomniscient and has every knowledge innate in it; while the personal self isthe creature of its environment and the slave of the physical memory. Couldthe former manifest itself uninterruptedly, and without impediment, therewould be no longer men on earth, but we should all be gods.Q. Still there ought to be exceptions, and some ought to remember.A. And so there are. But who believes in their report? Such sensitives aregenerally regarded as hallucinated hysteriacs, as crack-brained enthusiasts,or humbugs, by modern materialism. Let them read, however, works on thissubject, preeminently Reincarnation, a Study of Forgotten Truth by E.D.Walker, F.T.S., and see in it the mass of proofs which the able authorbrings to bear on this vexed question. One speaks to people of soul, andsome ask \"What is Soul?\" \"Have you ever proved its existence?\" Of course itis useless to argue with those who are materialists. But even to them Iwould put the question:Can you remember what you were or did when a baby? Have you preserved thesmallest recollection of your life, thoughts, or deeds, or that you lived atall during the first eighteen months or two years of your existence? Thenwhy not deny that you have ever lived as a babe, on the same principle?When to all this we add that the reincarnating Ego, or individuality,retains during the Devachanic period merely the essence of the experience ofits past earth-life or personality, the whole physical experience involvinginto a state of in potentia, or being, so to speak, translated intospiritual formulae; when we remember further that the term between tworebirths is said to extend from ten to fifteen centuries, during which timethe physical consciousness is totally and absolutely inactive, having noorgans to act through, and therefore no existence, the reason for theabsence of all remembrance in the purely physical memory is apparent.Q. You just said that the Spiritual Ego was omniscient. Where, then, is thatvaunted omniscience during his Devachanic life, as you call it?A. During that time it is latent and potential, because, first of all, theSpiritual Ego (the compound of Buddhi-Manas) is not the Higher Self, whichbeing one with the Universal Soul or Mind is alone omniscient; and,secondly, because Devachan is the idealized continuation of the terrestriallife just left behind, a period of retributive adjustment, and a reward forunmerited wrongs and sufferings undergone in that special life. It isomniscient only potentially in Devachan, and de facto exclusively inNirvana, when the Ego is merged in the Universal Mind-Soul. Yet it rebecomesquasi omniscient during those hours on earth when certain abnormalconditions and physiological changes in the body make the Ego free from thetrammels of matter. Thus the examples cited above of somnambulists, a poorservant speaking Hebrew, and another playing the violin, give you anillustration of the case in point. This does not mean that the explanationsof these two facts offered us by medical science have no truth in them, forPage 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtone girl had, years before, heard her master, a clergyman, read Hebrew worksaloud, and the other had heard an artist playing a violin at their farm. Butneither could have done so as perfectly as they did had they not beenensouled by that which, owing to the sameness of its nature with theUniversal Mind, is omniscient. Here the higher principle acted on theSkandhas and moved them; in the other, the personality being paralyzed, theindividuality manifested itself. Pray do not confuse the two.  -oOo-On Individuality and PersonalityQ. But what is the difference between the two?A. Even Col. Olcott, forced to it by the logic of Esoteric philosophy, foundhimself obliged to correct the mistakes of previous Orientalists who made nosuch distinction, and gives the reader his reasons for it. Thus he says:The successive appearances upon the earth, or \"descents into generation,\" ofthe tanhaically coherent parts (Skandhas) of a certain being, are asuccession of personalities. In each birth the personality differs from thatof a previous or next succeeding birth. Karma, the deus ex machina, masks(or shall we say reflects?) itself now in the personality of a sage, againas an artisan, and so on throughout the string of births. But thoughpersonalities ever shift, the one line of life along which they are strung,like beads, runs unbroken; it is ever that particular line, never any other.It is therefore individual, an individual vital undulation, which began inNirvana, or the subjective side of nature, as the light or heat undulationthrough aether, began at its dynamic source; is careering through theobjective side of nature under the impulse of Karma and the creativedirection of Tanha (the unsatisfied desire for existence); and leads throughmany cyclic changes back to Nirvana. Mr. Rhys-Davids calls that which passesfrom personality to personality along the individual chain character, ordoing. Since character is not a mere metaphysical abstraction, but the sumof one's mental qualities and moral propensities, would it not help todispel what Mr. Rhys-Davids calls \"the desperate expedient of a mystery\" ifwe regarded the life-undulation as individuality, and each of its series ofnatal manifestations as a separate personality? The perfect individual,Buddhist speaking, is a Buddha, I should say; for Buddha is but the rareflower of humanity, without the least supernatural admixture. And ascountless generations (\"four asankheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles,\")are required to develop a man into a Buddha, and the iron will to become oneruns throughout all the successive births, what shall we call that whichthus wills and perseveres? Character? One's individuality: an individualitybut partly manifested in any one birth, but built up of fragments from allthe births?Q. I confess that I am still in the dark. Indeed it is just that difference,then, that you cannot impress too much on our minds.A. I try to; but alas, it is harder with some than to make them feel areverence for childish impossibilities, only because they are orthodox, andbecause orthodoxy is respectable. To understand the idea well, you have tofirst study the dual sets of principles: the spiritual, or those whichbelong to the imperishable Ego; and the material, or those principles whichmake up the ever-changing bodies or the series of personalities of that Ego.Let us fix permanent names to these, and say that:1. Atma, the \"Higher Self,\" is neither your Spirit nor mine, but likesunlight shines on all. It is the universally diffused \"divine principle,\"and is inseparable from its one and absolute Meta-Spirit, as the sunbeam isinseparable from sunlight.2. Buddhi (the spiritual soul) is only its vehicle. Neither each separately,Page 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtnor the two collectively, are of any more use to the body of man, thansunlight and its beams are for a mass of granite buried in the earth, unlessthe divine Duad is assimilated by, and reflected in, some consciousness.Neither Atma nor Buddhi are ever reached by Karma, because the former is thehighest aspect of Karma, its working agent of itself in one aspect, and theother is unconscious on this plane. This consciousness or mind is,3. Manas, the derivation or product in a reflected form of Ahankara, \"theconception of I,\" or Ego-ship. It is, therefore, when inseparably united tothe first two, called the Spiritual Ego, and Taijasi (the radiant). This isthe real Individuality, or the divine man. It is this Ego which-havingoriginally incarnated in the senseless human form animated by, butunconscious (since it had no consciousness) of, the presence in itself ofthe dual monad-made of that human-like form a real man.Mahat or the \"Universal Mind\" is the source of Manas. The latter is Mahat,i.e., mind, in man. Manas is also called Kshetrajña, \"embodied Spirit,\"because it is, according to our philosophy, the Manasaputras, or \"Sons ofthe Universal Mind,\" who created, or rather produced, the thinking man,\"manu,\" by incarnating in the third Race mankind in our Round. It is Manas,therefore, which is the real incarnating and permanent Spiritual Ego, theindividuality, and our various and numberless personalities only itsexternal masks.It is that Ego, that \"Causal Body,\" which overshadows every personalityKarma forces it to incarnate into; and this Ego which is held responsiblefor all the sins committed through, and in, every new body orpersonality-the evanescent masks which hide the true Individual through thelong series of rebirths.Q. But is this just? Why should this Ego receive punishment as the result ofdeeds which it has forgotten?A. It has not forgotten them; it knows and remembers its misdeeds as well asyou remember what you have done yesterday. Is it because the memory of thatbundle of physical compounds called \"body\" does not recollect what itspredecessor (the personality that was) did, that you imagine that the realEgo has forgotten them? As well say it is unjust that the new boots on thefeet of a boy, who is flogged for stealing apples, should be punished forthat which they know nothing of.Q. But are there no modes of communication between the Spiritual and humanconsciousness or memory?A. Of course there are; but they have never been recognized by yourscientific modern psychologists. To what do you attribute intuition, the\"voice of the conscience,\" premonitions, vague undefined reminiscences,etc., etc., if not to such communications? Would that the majority ofeducated men, at least, had the fine spiritual perceptions of Coleridge, whoshows how intuitional he is in some of his comments. Hear what he says withrespect to the probability that \"all thoughts are in themselvesimperishable.\"If the intelligent faculty (sudden 'revivals' of memory) should be renderedmore comprehensive, it would require only a different and appropriateorganization, the body celestial instead of the body terrestrial, to bringbefore every human soul the collective experience of its whole pastexistence (existences, rather).And this body celestial is our Manasic Ego.  -oOo-On the Reward and Punishment of the EgoPage 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. I have heard you say that the Ego, whatever the life of the person heincarnated in may have been on Earth, is never visited with postmortempunishment.A. Never, save in very exceptional and rare cases of which we will not speakhere, as the nature of the \"punishment\" in no way approaches any of yourtheological conceptions of damnation.Q. But if it is punished in this life for the misdeeds committed in aprevious one, then it is this Ego that ought to be rewarded also, whetherhere, or when disincarnated.A. And so it is. If we do not admit of any punishment outside of this earth,it is because the only state the Spiritual Self knows of, hereafter, is thatof unalloyed bliss.Q. What do you mean?A. Simply this: crimes and sins committed on a plane of objectivity and in aworld of matter, cannot receive punishment in a world of pure subjectivity.We believe in no hell or paradise as localities; in no objective hellfiresand worms that never die, nor in any Jerusalem with streets paved withsapphires and diamonds. What we believe in is a postmortem state or mentalcondition, such as we are in during a vivid dream. We believe in animmutable law of absolute Love, Justice, and Mercy. And believing in it, wesay: Whatever the sin and dire results of the original Karmic transgressionof the now incarnated Egos no man (or the outer material and periodical formof the Spiritual Entity) can be held, with any degree of justice,responsible for the consequences of his birth. He does not ask to be born,nor can he choose the parents that will give him life. In every respect heis a victim to his environment, the child of circumstances over which he hasno control; and if each of his transgressions were impartially investigated,there would be found nine out of every ten cases when he was the one sinnedagainst, rather than the sinner.It is on this transgression that the cruel and illogical dogma of the FallenAngels has been built. It is explained in Vol. II of The Secret Doctrine.All our \"Egos\" are thinking and rational entities (Manasaputas) who hadlived, whether under human or other forms, in the precedent life cycle(Manvantara), and whose Karma it was to incarnate in the man of this one. Itwas taught in the Mysteries that, having delayed to comply with this law (orhaving \"refused to create\" as Hinduism says of the Kumaras and Christianlegend of the Archangel Michael), i.e., having failed to incarnate in duetime, the bodies predestined for them got defiled, hence the original sin ofthe senseless forms and the punishment of the Egos. That which is meant bythe rebellious angels being hurled down into Hell is simply explained bythese pure Spirits or Egos being imprisoned in bodies of unclean matter,flesh.Life is at best a heartless play, a stormy sea to cross, and a heavy burdenoften too difficult to bear. The greatest philosophers have tried in vain tofathom and find out its raison d'être, and have all failed except those whohad the key to it, namely, the Eastern sages. Life is, as Shakespearedescribes it:... but a walking shadow-a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Page 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtSignifying nothing.Nothing in its separate parts, yet of the greatest importance in itscollectivity or series of lives. At any rate, almost every individual lifeis, in its full development, a sorrow. And are we to believe that poor,helpless man, after being tossed about like a piece of rotten timber on theangry billows of life, is, if he proves too weak to resist them, to bepunished by never-ending damnation, or even a temporary punishment? Never!Whether a great or an average sinner, good or bad, guilty or innocent, oncedelivered of the burden of physical life, the tired and worn-out Manu(\"thinking Ego\") has won the right to a period of absolute rest and bliss.The same unerringly wise and just rather than merciful Law, which inflictsupon the incarnated Ego the Karmic punishment for every sin committed duringthe preceding life on Earth, provided for the now disembodied Entity a longlease of mental rest, i.e., the entire oblivion of every sad event, aye, tothe smallest painful thought, that took place in its last life as apersonality, leaving in the soul-memory but the reminiscence of that whichwas bliss, or led to happiness. Plotinus, who said that our body was thetrue river of Lethe, for \"souls plunged into it forget all,\" meant more thanhe said. For, as our terrestrial body is like Lethe, so is our celestialbody in Devachan, and much more.Q. Then am I to understand that the murderer, the transgressor of law divineand human in every shape, is allowed to go unpunished?A. Who ever said that? Our philosophy has a doctrine of punishment as sternas that of the most rigid Calvinist, only far more philosophical andconsistent with absolute justice. No deed, not even a sinful thought, willgo unpunished; the latter more severely even than the former, as a thoughtis far more potential in creating evil results than even a deed.Verily I say unto you, that whosoever looketh at a woman to lust after her,hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.We believe in an unerring law of Retribution, called Karma, which assertsitself in a natural concatenation of causes and their unavoidable results.Q. And how, or where, does it act?A. Every laborer is worthy of his hire, saith Wisdom in the Gospel; everyaction, good or bad, is a prolific parent, saith the Wisdom of the Ages. Putthe two together, and you will find the \"why.\" After allowing the Soul,escaped from the pangs of personal life, a sufficient, aye, a hundredfoldcompensation, Karma, with its army of Skandhas, waits at the threshold ofDevachan, whence the Ego reemerges to assume a new incarnation. It is atthis moment that the future destiny of the now-rested Ego trembles in thescales of just Retribution, as it now falls once again under the sway ofactive Karmic law. It is in this rebirth which is ready for it, a rebirthselected and prepared by this mysterious, inexorable, but in the equity andwisdom of its decrees infallible law, that the sins of the previous life ofthe Ego are punished. Only it is into no imaginary Hell, with theatricalflames and ridiculous tailed and horned devils, that the Ego is cast, butverily onto this earth, the plane and region of his sins, where he will haveto atone for every bad thought and deed. As he has sown, so will he reap.Reincarnation will gather around him all those other Egos who have suffered,whether directly or indirectly, at the hands, or even through theunconscious instrumentality, of the past personality. They will be thrown byNemesis in the way of the new man, concealing the old, the eternal Ego, and...Q. But where is the equity you speak of, since these new \"personalities\" arenot aware of having sinned or been sinned against?A. Has the coat torn to shreds from the back of the man who stole it, byPage 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtanother man who was robbed of it and recognizes his property, to be regardedas fairly dealt with? The new \"personality\" is no better than a fresh suitof clothes with its specific characteristics, color, form, and qualities;but the real man who wears it is the same culprit as of old. It is theindividuality who suffers through his \"personality.\" And it is this, andthis alone, that can account for the terrible, still only apparent,injustice in the distribution of lots in life to man. When your modernphilosophers will have succeeded in showing to us a good reason, why so manyapparently innocent and good men are born only to suffer during a wholelifetime; why so many are born poor unto starvation in the slums of greatcities, abandoned by fate and men; why, while these are born in the gutter,others open their eyes to light in palaces; while a noble birth and fortuneseem often given to the worst of men and only rarely to the worthy; whilethere are beggars whose inner selves are peers to the highest and noblest ofmen; when this, and much more, is satisfactorily explained by either yourphilosophers or theologians, then only, but not till then, you will have theright to reject the theory of reincarnation. The highest and grandest ofpoets have dimly perceived this truth of truths. Shelley believed in it,Shakespeare must have thought of it when writing on the worthlessness ofBirth. Remember his words:Why should my birth keep down my mounting spirit?Are not all creatures subject unto time?There's legions now of beggars on the earth,That their original did spring from Kings,And many monarchs now, whose fathers wereThe riff-raff of their age ...Alter the word fathers into Egos-and you will have the truth.On the Kamaloka and Devachan On the Fate of the Lower PrinciplesQ. You spoke of Kamaloka, what is it?A. When the man dies, his lower three principles leave him forever; i.e.,body, life, and the vehicle of the latter, the astral body or the double ofthe living man. And then, his four principles-the central or middleprinciple, the animal soul or Kamarupa, with what it has assimilated fromthe lower Manas, and the higher triad find themselves in Kamaloka. Thelatter is an astral locality, the limbus of scholastic theology, the Hadesof the ancients, and, strictly speaking, a locality only in a relativesense. It has neither a definite area nor boundary, but exists withinsubjective space; i.e., is beyond our sensuous perceptions. Still it exists,and it is there that the astral eidolons of all the beings that have lived,animals included, await their second death. For the animals it comes withthe disintegration and the entire fading out of their astral particles tothe last. For the human eidolon it begins when the Atma-Buddhi-Manasic triadis said to \"separate\" itself from its lower principles, or the reflection ofthe ex-personality, by falling into the Devachanic state.Q. And what happens after this?A. Then the Kamarupic phantom, remaining bereft of its informing thinkingprinciple, the higher Manas, and the lower aspect of the latter, the animalintelligence, no longer receiving light from the higher mind, and no longerhaving a physical brain to work through, collapses.Page 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. In what way?A. Well, it falls into the state of the frog when certain portions of itsbrain are taken out by the vivisector. It can think no more, even on thelowest animal plane. Henceforth it is no longer even the lower Manas, sincethis \"lower\" is nothing without the \"higher.\"Q. And is it this nonentity which we find materializing in Seance rooms withMediums?A. It is this nonentity. A true nonentity, however, only as to reasoning orcogitating powers, still an Entity, however astral and fluidic, as shown incertain cases when, having been magnetically and unconsciously drawn towarda medium, it is revived for a time and lives in him by proxy, so to speak.This \"spook,\" or the Kamarupa, may be compared with the jelly-fish, whichhas an ethereal gelatinous appearance so long as it is in its own element,or water (the medium's specific aura), but which, no sooner is it thrown outof it, than it dissolves in the hand or on the sand, especially in sunlight.In the medium's Aura, it lives a kind of vicarious life and reasons andspeaks either through the medium's brain or those of other persons present.But this would lead us too far, and upon other people's grounds, whereon Ihave no desire to trespass. Let us keep to the subject of reincarnation.Q. What of the latter? How long does the incarnating Ego remain in theDevachanic state?A. This, we are taught, depends on the degree of spirituality and the meritor demerit of the last incarnation. The average time is from ten to fifteencenturies, as I already told you.Q. But why could not this Ego manifest and communicate with mortals asSpiritualists will have it? What is there to prevent a mother fromcommunicating with the children she left on earth, a husband with his wife,and so on? It is a most consoling belief, I must confess; nor do I wonderthat those who believe in it are so averse to give it up.A. Nor are they forced to, unless they happen to prefer truth to fiction,however \"consoling.\" Uncongenial our doctrines may be to Spiritualists; yet,nothing of what we believe in and teach is half as selfish and cruel as whatthey preach.Q. I do not understand you. What is selfish?A. Their doctrine of the return of Spirits, the real \"personalities\" as theysay; and I will tell you why. If Devachan-call it \"paradise\" if you like, a\"place of bliss and of supreme felicity,\" if it is anything-is such a place(or say state), logic tells us that no sorrow or even a shade of pain can beexperienced therein. \"God shall wipe away all the tears from the eyes\" ofthose in paradise, we read in the book of many promises. And if the \"Spiritsof the dead\" are enabled to return and see all that is happening on earth,and especially in their homes, what kind of bliss can be in store for them?  -oOo-Why Theosophists Do Not Believe in the Return of Pure \"Spirits\"Q. What do you mean? Why should this interfere with their bliss?A. Simply this; and here is an instance. A mother dies, leaving behind herlittle helpless children-orphans whom she adores-perhaps a beloved husbandalso. We say that her \"Spirit\" or Ego-that individuality which is now allimpregnated, for the entire Devachanic period, with the noblest feelingsheld by its late personality, i.e., love for her children, pity for thosewho suffer, and so on-we say that it is now entirely separated from thePage 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txt\"vale of tears,\" that its future bliss consists in that blessed ignorance ofall the woes it left behind. Spiritualists say, on the contrary, that it isas vividly aware of them, and more so than before, for \"Spirits see morethan mortals in the flesh do.\" We say that the bliss of the Devachaneeconsists in its complete conviction that it has never left the earth, andthat there is no such thing as death at all; that the postmortem spiritualconsciousness of the mother will represent to her that she lives surroundedby her children and all those whom she loved; that no gap, no link, will bemissing to make her disembodied state the most perfect and absolutehappiness. The Spiritualists deny this point blank. According to theirdoctrine, unfortunate man is not liberated even by death from the sorrows ofthis life. Not a drop from the life-cup of pain and suffering will miss hislips; and whether willing or unwilling, since he sees everything now, shallhe drink it to the bitter dregs. Thus, the loving wife, who during herlifetime was ready to save her husband sorrow at the price of her heart'sblood, is now doomed to see, in utter helplessness, his despair, and toregister every hot tear he sheds for her loss. Worse than that, she may seethe tears dry too soon, and another beloved face shine on him, the father ofher children; find another woman replacing her in his affections; doomed tohear her orphans giving the holy name of \"mother\" to one indifferent tothem, and to see those little children neglected, if not ill-treated.According to this doctrine the \"gentle wafting to immortal life\" becomeswithout any transition the way into a new path of mental suffering! And yet,the columns of the Banner of Light, the veteran journal of the AmericanSpiritualists, are filled with messages from the dead, the \"dear departedones,\" who all write to say how very happy they are! Is such a state ofknowledge consistent with bliss? Then bliss stands in such a case for thegreatest curse, and orthodox damnation must be a relief in comparison to it!Q. But how does your theory avoid this? How can you reconcile the theory ofSoul's omniscience with its blindness to that which is taking place onearth?A. Because such is the law of love and mercy. During every Devachanic periodthe Ego, omniscient as it is per se, clothes itself, so to say, with thereflection of the \"personality\" that was. I have just told you that theideal efflorescence of all the abstract, therefore undying and eternalqualities or attributes, such as love and mercy, the love of the good, thetrue and the beautiful, that ever spoke in the heart of the living\"personality,\" clung after death to the Ego, and therefore followed it toDevachan. For the time being, then, the Ego becomes the ideal reflection ofthe human being it was when last on earth, and that is not omniscient. Wereit that, it would never be in the state we call Devachan at all.Q. What are your reasons for it?A. If you want an answer on the strict lines of our philosophy, then I willsay that it is because everything is illusion (Maya ) outside of eternaltruth, which has neither form, color, nor limitation. He who has placedhimself beyond the veil of Maya -and such are the highest Adepts andInitiates-can have no Devachan. As to the ordinary mortal, his bliss in itis complete. It is an absolute oblivion of all that gave it pain or sorrowin the past incarnation, and even oblivion of the fact that such things aspain or sorrow exist at all. The Devachanee lives its intermediate cyclebetween two incarnations surrounded by everything it had aspired to in vain,and in the companionship of everyone it loved on earth. It has reached thefulfillment of all its soul-yearnings. And thus it lives throughout longcenturies an existence of unalloyed happiness, which is the reward for itssufferings in earth-life. In short, it bathes in a sea of uninterruptedfelicity spanned only by events of still greater felicity in degree.Q. But this is more than simple delusion, it is an existence of insanehallucinations!Page 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. From your standpoint it may be, not so from that of philosophy. Besideswhich, is not our whole terrestrial life filled with such delusions? Haveyou never met men and women living for years in a fool's paradise? Andbecause you should happen to learn that the husband of a wife, whom sheadores and believes herself as beloved by him, is untrue to her, would yougo and break her heart and beautiful dream by rudely awakening her to thereality? I think not. I say it again, such oblivion and hallucination-if youcall it so-are only a merciful law of nature and strict justice. At anyrate, it is a far more fascinating prospect than the orthodox golden harpwith a pair of wings. The assurance thatThe soul that lives ascends frequently and runs familiarly through thestreets of the heavenly Jerusalem, visiting the patriarchs and prophets,saluting the apostles, and admiring the army of martyrs.-may seem of a more pious character to some. Nevertheless, it is ahallucination of a far more delusive character, since mothers love theirchildren with an immortal love, we all know, while the personages mentionedin the \"heavenly Jerusalem\" are still of a rather doubtful nature. But Iwould, still, rather accept the \"new Jerusalem,\" with its streets paved likethe show windows of a jeweler's shop, than find consolation in the heartlessdoctrine of the Spiritualists. The idea alone that the intellectualconscious souls of one's father, mother, daughter, or brother find theirbliss in a \"Summerland\"-only a little more natural, but just as ridiculousas the \"New Jerusalem\" in its description-would be enough to make one loseevery respect for one's \"departed ones.\" To believe that a pure spirit canfeel happy while doomed to witness the sins, mistakes, treachery, and, aboveall, the sufferings of those from whom it is severed by death and whom itloves best, without being able to help them, would be a maddening thought.Q. There is something in your argument. I confess to having never seen it inthis light.A. Just so, and one must be selfish to the core and utterly devoid of thesense of retributive justice, to have ever imagined such a thing. We arewith those whom we have lost in material form, and far, far nearer to themnow, than when they were alive. And it is not only in the fancy of theDevachanee, as some may imagine, but in reality. For pure divine love is notmerely the blossom of a human heart, but has its roots in eternity.Spiritual holy love is immortal, and Karma brings sooner or later all thosewho loved each other with such a spiritual affection to incarnate once morein the same family group. Again we say that love beyond the grave, illusionthough you may call it, has a magic and divine potency which reacts on theliving. A mother's Ego filled with love for the imaginary children it seesnear itself, living a life of happiness, as real to it as when on earth-thatlove will always be felt by the children in flesh. It will manifest in theirdreams, and often in various events-in providential protection and escape,for love is a strong shield, and is not limited by space or time. As withthis Devachanic \"mother,\" so with the rest of human relationships andattachments, save the purely selfish or material. Analogy will suggest toyou the rest.Q. In no case, then, do you admit the possibility of the communication ofthe living with the disembodied spirit?A. Yes, there is a case, and even two exceptions to the rule.The first exception is during the few days that follow immediately the deathof a person and before the Ego passes into the Devachanic state. Whether anyliving mortal, save a few exceptional cases has derived much benefit fromthe return of the spirit into the objective plane is another question. Thespirit is dazed after death and falls very soon into what we call\"predevachanic unconsciousness.\" When the intensity of the desire in thedying person to return for some purpose forced the higher consciousness toPage 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtremain awake, and therefore it was really the individuality, the \"Spirit\"that communicated.The second exception is found in the Nirmanakayas.Q. What about them? And what does the name mean for you?A. It is the name given to those who, though they have won the right toNirvana and cyclic rest have out of pity for mankind and those they left onearth renounced the Nirv ic state. This is not \"Devachan,\" as the latter isan illusion of our consciousness, a happy dream, and as those who are fitfor Nirvana must have lost entirely every desire or possibility of theworld's illusions.Such an adept, or Saint, or whatever you may call him, believing it aselfish act to rest in bliss while mankind groans under the burden of miseryproduced by ignorance, renounces Nirvana, and determines to remain invisiblein spirit on this earth. They have no material body, as they have left itbehind; but otherwise they remain with all their principles even in astrallife in our sphere. And such can and do communicate with a few elect ones,only surely not with ordinary mediums.Q. I have put you the question about Nirmanakayas because I read in someGerman and other works that it was the name given to the terrestrialappearances or bodies assumed by Buddhas in the Northern Buddhist teachings.A. So they are, only the Orientalists have confused this terrestrial body byunderstanding it to be objective and physical instead of purely astral andsubjective.Q. And what good can they do on earth?A. Not much, as regards individuals, as they have no right to interfere withKarma, and can only advise and inspire mortals for the general good. Yetthey do more beneficent actions than you imagine.Q. To this Science would never subscribe, not even modern psychology. Forthem, no portion of intelligence can survive the physical brain. What wouldyou answer them?A. I would not even go to the trouble of answering, but would simply say, inthe words given to \"M.A. Oxon,\"Intelligence is perpetuated after the body is dead. Though it is not aquestion of the brain only ... It is reasonable to propound theindestructibility of the human spirit from what we know.Q. But \"M.A. Oxon\" is a Spiritualist?A. Quite so, and the only true Spiritualist I know of, though we may stilldisagree with him on many a minor question. Apart from this, no Spiritualistcomes nearer to the occult truths than he does. Like any one of us he speaksincessantly... of the surface dangers that beset the ill-equipped, feather-headed muddlerwith the occult, who crosses the threshold without counting the cost. Somethings that I do know of Spiritualism and some that I do not.Our only disagreement rests in the question of \"Spirit Identity.\" Otherwise,I, for one, coincide almost entirely with him, and accept the threepropositions he embodied in his address of July, 1884. It is this eminentSpiritualist, rather, who disagrees with us, not we with him.Q. What are these propositions?Page 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. They are:1. That there is a life coincident with, and independent of the physicallife of the body.2. That, as a necessary corollary, this life extends beyond the life of thebody. We say it extends throughout Devachan.3. That there is communication between the denizens of that state ofexistence and those of the world in which we now live.All depend, you see, on the minor and secondary aspects of these fundamentalpropositions. Everything depends on the views we take of Spirit and Soul, orIndividuality and Personality. Spiritualists confuse the two \"into one.\" Weseparate them, and say that, with the exceptions above enumerated, no Spiritwill revisit the earth, though the animal Soul may. But let us return oncemore to our direct subject, the Skandhas.Q. I begin to understand better now. It is the Spirit, so to say, of thoseSkandhas which are the most ennobling, which, attaching themselves to theincarnating Ego, survive, and are added to the stock of its angelicexperiences. And it is the attributes connected with the material Skandhas,with selfish and personal motives. which, disappearing from the field ofaction between two incarnations, reappear at the subsequent incarnation asKarmic results to be atoned for; and therefore the Spirit will not leaveDevachan. Is it so?A. Very nearly so. If you add to this that the law of retribution, or Karma,rewarding the highest and most spiritual in Devachan, never fails to rewardthem again on earth by giving them a further development, and furnishing theEgo with a body fitted for it, then you will be quite correct.  -oOo-A Few Words About the SkandhasQ. What becomes of the other, the lower Skandhas of the personality, afterthe death of the body? Are they quite destroyed?A. They are and yet they are not-a fresh metaphysical and occult mystery foryou. They are destroyed as the working stock in hand of the personality;they remain as Karmic effects, as germs, hanging in the atmosphere of theterrestrial plane, ready to come to life, as so many avenging fiends, toattach themselves to the new personality of the Ego when it reincarnates.Q. This really passes my comprehension, and is very difficult to understand.A. Not once that you have assimilated all the details. For then you will seethat for logic, consistency, profound philosophy, divine mercy and equity,this doctrine of Reincarnation has not its equal on earth. It is a belief ina perpetual progress for each incarnating Ego, or divine soul, in anevolution from the outward into the inward, from the material to theSpiritual, arriving at the end of each stage at absolute unity with thedivine Principle. From strength to strength, from the beauty and perfectionof one plane to the greater beauty and perfection of another, withaccessions of new glory, of fresh knowledge and power in each cycle, such isthe destiny of every Ego, which thus becomes its own Savior in each worldand incarnation.Q. But Christianity teaches the same. It also preaches progression.A. Yes, only with the addition of something else. It tells us of theimpossibility of attaining Salvation without the aid of a miraculous Savior,Page 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtand therefore dooms to perdition all those who will not accept the dogma.This is just the difference between Christian theology and Theosophy. Theformer enforces belief in the Descent of the Spiritual Ego into the LowerSelf; the latter inculcates the necessity of endeavoring to elevate oneselfto the Christos, or Buddhi state.Q. By teaching the annihilation of consciousness in case of failure,however, don't you think that it amounts to the annihilation of Self, a inthe opinion of the non-metaphysical?A. From the standpoint of those who believe in the resurrection of the bodyliterally, and insist that every bone, every artery and atom of flesh willbe raised bodily on the Judgment Day-of course it does. If you still insistthat it is the perishable form and finite qualities that make up immortalman, then we shall hardly understand each other. And if you do notunderstand that, by limiting the existence of every Ego to one life onearth, you make of Deity an ever-drunken Indra of the Pur ic dead letter, acruel Moloch, a god who makes an inextricable mess on Earth, and yet claimsthanks for it, then the sooner we drop the conversation the better.Q. But let us return, now that the subject of the Skandhas is disposed of,to the question of the consciousness which survives death. This is the pointwhich interests most people. Do we possess more knowledge in Devachan thanwe do in earthlife?A. In one sense, we can acquire more knowledge; that is, we can developfurther any faculty which we loved and strove after during life, provided itis concerned with abstract and ideal things, such as music, painting,poetry, etc., since Devachan is merely an idealized and subjectivecontinuation of earth-life.Q. But if in Devachan the Spirit is free from matter, why should it notpossess all knowledge?A. Because, as I told you, the Ego is, so to say, wedded to the memory ofits last incarnation. Thus, if you think over what I have said, and stringall the facts together, you will realize that the Devachanic state is notone of omniscience, but a transcendental continuation of the personal lifejust terminated. It is the rest of the soul from the toils of life.Q. But the scientific materialists assert that after the death of mannothing remains; that the human body simply disintegrates into its componentelements; and that what we call soul is merely a temporaryself-consciousness produced as a byproduct of organic action, which willevaporate like steam. Is not theirs a strange state of mind?A. Not strange at all, that I see. If they say that self-consciousnessceases with the body, then in their case they simply utter an unconsciousprophecy, for once they are firmly convinced of what they assert, noconscious after-life is possible for them. For there are exceptions to everyrule.  -oOo-On Postmortem and Postnatal ConsciousnessQ. But if human self-consciousness survives death as a rule, why shouldthere be exceptions?A. In the fundamental principles of the spiritual world no exception ispossible. But there are rules for those who see, and rules for those whoprefer to remain blind.Q. Quite so, I understand. This is but an aberration of the blind man, whoPage 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtdenies the existence of the sun because he does not see it. But after deathhis spiritual eyes will certainly compel him to see. Is this what you mean?A. He will not be compelled, nor will he see anything. Having persistentlydenied during life the continuance of existence after death, he will beunable to see it, because his spiritual capacity having been stunted inlife, it cannot develop after death, and he will remain blind. By insistingthat he must see it, you evidently mean one thing and I another. You speakof the spirit from the spirit, or the flame from the flame-of Atma, inshort-and you confuse it with the human soul-Manas ... You do not understandme; let me try to make it clear. The whole gist of your question is to knowwhether, in the case of a downright materialist, the complete loss ofself-consciousness and self-perception after death is possible? Isn't it so?I answer, it is possible. Because, believing firmly in our EsotericDoctrine, which refers to the postmortem period, or the interval between twolives or births, as merely a transitory state, I say, whether that intervalbetween two acts of the illusionary drama of life lasts one year or amillion, that postmortem state may, without any breach of the fundamentallaw, prove to be just the same state as that of a man who is in a deadfaint.Q. But since you have just said that the fundamental laws of the after-deathstate admit of no exceptions, how can this be?A. Nor do I say that it does admit of an exception. But the spiritual law ofcontinuity applies only to things which are truly real. To one who has readand understood Mundakya Upanishad and Vedantasara all this becomes veryclear. I will say more: it is sufficient to understand what we mean byBuddhi and the duality of Manas to gain a clear perception why thematerialist may fail to have a self-conscious survival after death. SinceManas, in its lower aspect, is the seat of the terrestrial mind, it can,therefore, give only that perception of the Universe which is based on theevidence of that mind; it cannot give spiritual vision. It is said in theEastern school, that between Buddhi and Manas (the Ego), or Isvara andPrajña *1) there is in reality no more difference than between a forest andits trees, a lake and its waters, as the Mundakya teaches. One or hundredsof trees dead from loss of vitality, or uprooted, are yet incapable ofpreventing the forest from being still a forest. 1. But, as I understand it, Buddhi represents in this simile the forest, and Manas-Taijasi *2) the trees. And if Buddhi is immortal, how can that which is similar to it, i.e., Manas-Taijasi , entirely lose its consciousness till the day of its new incarnation? I cannot understand it.*1) Isvara is the collective consciousness of the manifested godhead,Brahma, i.e. the collective consciousness of the host of Dhyan Chohans (seeSecret Doctrine); Prajña is their individual wisdom.*2) Taijasi means the 'radiant', as a consequence of its union with Buddhi,i.e. Manas, the human soul, enlightened by the rays of the divine soul.Hence Manas-Taijasi can be described as radiant intellect, the human reasonenlightened by the light of the spirit; and Buddhi-Manas is the revelationof the divine plus the human intellect and self-consciousness.(These two footnotes reversely translated from Dutch.[ editor])A. You cannot, because you will mix up an abstract representation of thewhole with its casual changes of form. Remember that if it can be said ofBuddhi-Manas that it is unconditionally immortal, the same cannot be said ofthe lower Manas, still less of Taijasi , which is merely an attribute.Neither of these, neither Manas nor Taijasi , can exist apart from Buddhi,the divine soul, because the first (Manas) is, in its lower aspect, aquality of the terrestrial personality, and the second (Taijasi ) isPage 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtidentical with the first, because it is the same Manas only with the lightof Buddhi reflected on it. In its turn, Buddhi would remain only animpersonal spirit without this element which it borrows from the human soul,which conditions and makes of it, in this illusive Universe, as it weresomething separate from the universal soul for the whole period of the cycleof incarnation. Say rather that Buddhi-Manas can neither die nor lose itscompound self-consciousness in Eternity, nor the recollection of itsprevious incarnations in which the two-i.e., the spiritual and the humansoul-had been closely linked together. But it is not so in the case of amaterialist, whose human soul not only receives nothing from the divinesoul, but even refuses to recognize its existence. You can hardly apply thisaxiom to the attributes and qualities of the human soul, for it would belike saying that because your divine soul is immortal, therefore the bloomon your cheek must also be immortal; whereas this bloom, like Taijasi , issimply a transitory phenomenon.Q. Do I understand you to say that we must not mix in our minds the noumenonwith the phenomenon, the cause with its effect?A. I do say so, and repeat that, limited to Manas or the human soul alone,the radiance of Taijas itself becomes a mere question of time; because bothimmortality and consciousness after death become, for the terrestrialpersonality of man, simply conditioned attributes, as they depend entirelyon conditions and beliefs created by the human soul itself during the lifeof its body. Karma acts incessantly: we reap in our after-life only thefruit of that which we have ourselves sown in this.Q. But if my Ego can, after the destruction of my body, become plunged in astate of entire unconsciousness, then where can be the punishment for thesins of my past life?A. Our philosophy teaches that Karmic punishment reaches the Ego only in itsnext incarnation. After death it receives only the reward for the unmeritedsufferings endured during its past incarnation.(Some Theosophists have taken exception to this phrase, but the words arethose of Master, and the meaning attached to the word unmerited is thatgiven above. In the T.P.S. pamphlet No. 6, a phrase, criticized subsequentlyin Lucifer, was used which was intended to convey the same idea. In form,however, it was awkward and open to the criticism directed against it; butthe essential idea was that men often suffer from the effects of the actionsdone by others, effects which thus do not strictly belong to their ownKarma-and for these sufferings they of course deserve compensation.)The whole punishment after death, even for the materialist, consists,therefore, in the absence of any reward, and the utter loss of theconsciousness of one's bliss and rest. Karma is the child of the terrestrialEgo, the fruit of the actions of the tree which is the objective personalityvisible to all, as much as the fruit of all the thoughts and even motives ofthe spiritual \"I\"; but Karma is also the tender mother, who heals the woundsinflicted by her during the preceding life, before she will begin to torturethis Ego by inflicting upon him new ones. If it may be said that there isnot a mental or physical suffering in the life of a mortal which is not thedirect fruit and consequence of some sin in a preceding existence; on theother hand, since he does not preserve the slightest recollection of it inhis actual life, and feels himself not deserving of such punishment, andtherefore thinks he suffers for no guilt of his own, this alone issufficient to entitle the human soul to the fullest consolation, rest, andbliss in his postmortem existence. Death comes to our spiritual selves everas a deliverer and friend. For the materialist who, notwithstanding hismaterialism, was not a bad man, the interval between the two lives will belike the unbroken and placid sleep of a child, either entirely dreamless, orfilled with pictures of which he will have no definite perception; while forthe average mortal it will be a dream as vivid as life, and full ofPage 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtrealistic bliss and visions.Q. Then the personal man must always go on suffering blindly the Karmicpenalties which the Ego has incurred?A. Not quite so. At the solemn moment of death every man, even when death issudden, sees the whole of his past life marshaled before him, in itsminutest details. For one short instant the personal becomes one with theindividual and all-knowing Ego. But this instant is enough to show to himthe whole chain of causes which have been at work during his life. He seesand now understands himself as he is, unadorned by flattery orself-deception. He reads his life, remaining as a spectator looking downinto the arena he is quitting; he feels and knows the justice of all thesuffering that has overtaken him.Q. Does this happen to everyone?A. Without any exception. Very good and holy men see, we are taught, notonly the life they are leaving, but even several preceding lives in whichwere produced the causes that made them what they were in the life justclosing. They recognize the law of Karma in all its majesty and justice.Q. Is there anything corresponding to this before rebirth?A. There is. As the man at the moment of death has a retrospective insightinto the life he has led, so, at the moment he is reborn onto earth, theEgo, awaking from the state of Devachan, has a prospective vision of thelife which awaits him, and realizes all the causes that have led to it. Herealizes them and sees futurity, because it is between Devachan and rebirththat the Ego regains his full manasic consciousness, and rebecomes for ashort time the god he was, before, in compliance with Karmic law, he firstdescended into matter and incarnated in the first man of flesh. The \"goldenthread\" sees all its \"pearls\" and misses not one of them.  -oOo-What is Really Meant by AnnihilationQ. I have heard some Theosophists speak of a golden thread on which theirlives were strung. What do they mean by this?A. In the Hindu Sacred books it is said that the part of us which undergoesperiodical incarnation is the Sutratman, which means literally the \"ThreadSoul.\" It is a synonym of the reincarnating Ego-Manas conjoined withBuddhi-which absorbs the Manasic recollections of all our preceding lives.It is so called, because, like the pearls on a thread, so is the long seriesof human lives strung together on that one thread. In some Upanishad theserecurrent rebirths are likened to the life of a mortal which oscillatesperiodically between sleep and waking.Q. This, I must say, does not seem very clear, and I will tell you why. Forthe man who awakes, another day commences, but that man is the same in souland body as he was the day before; whereas at every incarnation a fullchange takes place not only of the external envelope, sex, and personality,but even of the mental and psychic capacities. The simile does not seem tome quite correct. The man who arises from sleep remembers quite clearly whathe has done yesterday, the day before, and even months and years ago. Butnone of us has the slightest recollection of a preceding life or of any factor event concerning it ... I may forget in the morning what I have dreamtduring the night, still I know that I have slept and have the certainty thatI lived during sleep; but what recollection can I have of my pastincarnation until the moment of death? How do you reconcile this?A. Some people do recollect their past incarnations during life; but thesePage 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtare Buddhas and Initiates. This is what the Yogis call Samm -Sambuddha, orthe knowledge of the whole series of one's past incarnations.Q. But we ordinary mortals who have not reached Samm -Sambuddha, how are weto understand this simile?A. By studying it and trying to understand more correctly thecharacteristics and the three kinds of sleep. Sleep is a general andimmutable law for man as for beast, but there are different kinds of sleepand still more different dreams and visions.Q. But this takes us to another subject. Let us return to the materialistwho, while not denying dreams, which he could hardly do, yet deniesimmortality in general and the survival of his own individuality.A. And the materialist, without knowing it, is right. One who has no innerperception of, and faith in, the immortality of his soul, in that man thesoul can never become Buddhi-Taijasi , but will remain simply Manas, and forManas alone there is no immortality possible. In order to live in the worldto come a conscious life, one has to believe first of all in that lifeduring the terrestrial existence. On these two aphorisms of the SecretScience all the philosophy about the postmortem consciousness and theimmortality of the soul is built. The Ego receives always according to itsdeserts. After the dissolution of the body, there commences for it a periodof full awakened consciousness, or a state of chaotic dreams, or an utterlydreamless sleep undistinguishable from annihilation, and these are the threekinds of sleep. If our physiologists find the cause of dreams and visions inan unconscious preparation for them during the waking hours, why cannot thesame be admitted for the postmortem dreams? I repeat it: death is sleep.After death, before the spiritual eyes of the soul, begins a performanceaccording to a program learnt and very often unconsciously composed byourselves: the practical carrying out of correct beliefs or of illusionswhich have been created by ourselves. The Methodist will be Methodist, theMuslim a Muslim, at least for some time-in a perfect fool's paradise of eachman's creation and making. These are the postmortem fruits of the tree oflife. Naturally, our belief or unbelief in the fact of conscious immortalityis unable to influence the unconditioned reality of the fact itself, oncethat it exists; but the belief or unbelief in that immortality as theproperty of independent or separate entities, cannot fail to give color tothat fact in its application to each of these entities. Now do you begin tounderstand it?Q. I think I do. The materialist, disbelieving in everything that cannot beproven to him by his five senses, or by scientific reasoning, basedexclusively on the data furnished by these senses in spite of theirinadequacy, and rejecting every spiritual manifestation, accepts life as theonly conscious existence. Therefore according to their beliefs so will it beunto them. They will lose their personal Ego, and will plunge into adreamless sleep until a new awakening. Is it so?A. Almost so. Remember the practically universal teaching of the two kindsof conscious existence: the terrestrial and the spiritual. The latter mustbe considered real from the very fact that it is inhabited by the eternal,changeless, and immortal Monad; whereas the incarnating Ego dresses itselfup in new garments entirely different from those of its previousincarnations, and in which all except its spiritual prototype is doomed to achange so radical as to leave no trace behind.Q. How so? Can my conscious terrestrial \"I\" perish not only for a time, likethe consciousness of the materialist, but so entirely as to leave no tracebehind?A. According to the teaching, it must so perish and in its fullness; allexcept the principle which, having united itself with the Monad, has therebyPage 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtbecome a purely spiritual and indestructible essence, one with it in theEternity. But in the case of an out-and-out materialist, in whose personal\"I\" no Buddhi has ever reflected itself, how can the latter carry away intothe Eternity one particle of that terrestrial personality? Your spiritual\"I\" is immortal; but from your present self it can carry away into Eternitythat only which has become worthy of immortality, namely, the aroma alone ofthe flower that has been mown by death.Q. Well, and the flower, the terrestrial \"I\"?A. The flower, as all past and future flowers which have blossomed and willhave to blossom on the mother bough, the Sutratman, all children of one rootor Buddhi-will return to dust. Your present \"I,\" as you yourself know, isnot the body now sitting before me, nor yet is it what I would callManas-Sutratman, but Sutratman-Buddhi.Q. But this does not explain to me, at all, why you call life after deathimmortal, infinite, and real, and the terrestrial life a simple phantom orillusion; since even that postmortem life has limits, however much widerthey may be than those of terrestrial life.A. No doubt. The spiritual Ego of man moves in eternity like a pendulumbetween the hours of birth and death. But if these hours, marking theperiods of life terrestrial and life spiritual, are limited in theirduration, and if the very number of such stages in Eternity between sleepand awakening, illusion and reality, has its beginning and its end, on theother hand, the spiritual pilgrim is eternal. Therefore are the hours of hispostmortem life, when, disembodied, he stands face to face with truth andnot the mirages of his transitory earthly existences, during the period ofthat pilgrimage which we call \"the cycle of rebirths\"-the only reality inour conception. Such intervals, their limitation notwithstanding, do notprevent the Ego, while ever perfecting itself, from following undeviatingly,though gradually and slowly, the path to its last transformation, when thatEgo, having reached its goal, becomes a divine being. These intervals andstages help towards this final result instead of hindering it; and withoutsuch limited intervals the divine Ego could never reach its ultimate goal. Ihave given you once already a familiar illustration by comparing the Ego, orthe individuality, to an actor, and its numerous and various incarnations tothe parts it plays. Will you call these parts or their costumes theindividuality of the actor himself? Like that actor, the Ego is forced toplay during the cycle of necessity, up to the very threshold of ParaNirvana,many parts such as may be unpleasant to it. But as the bee collects itshoney from every flower, leaving the rest as food for the earthly worms, sodoes our spiritual individuality, whether we call it Sutratman or Ego.Collecting from every terrestrial personality, into which Karma forces it toincarnate, the nectar alone of the spiritual qualities andself-consciousness, it unites all these into one whole and emerges from itschrysalis as the glorified Dhyani-Chohan. So much the worse for thoseterrestrial personalities from which it could collect nothing. Suchpersonalities cannot assuredly outlive consciously their terrestrialexistence.Q. Thus, then, it seems that, for the terrestrial personality, immortalityis still conditional. Is, then, immortality itself not unconditional?A. Not at all. But immortality cannot touch the non-existent: for all thatwhich exists as Sat, or emanates from Sat, immortality and Eternity areabsolute. Matter is the opposite pole of spirit, and yet the two are one.The essence of all this, i.e., Spirit, Force, and Matter, or the three inone, is as endless as it is beginningless; but the form acquired by thistriple unity during its incarnations, its externality, is certainly only theillusion of our personal conceptions. Therefore do we call Nirvana and theUniversal life alone a reality, while relegating the terrestrial life, itsterrestrial personality included, and even its Devachanic existence, to thePage 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtphantom realm of illusion.Q. But why in such a case call sleep the reality, and waking the illusion?A. It is simply a comparison made to facilitate the grasping of the subject,and from the standpoint of terrestrial conceptions it is a very correct one.Q. And still I cannot understand, if the life to come is based on justiceand the merited retribution for all our terrestrial suffering, how in thecase of materialists, many of whom are really honest and charitable men,there should remain of their personality nothing but the refuse of a fadedflower.A. No one ever said such a thing. No materialist, however unbelieving, candie forever in the fullness of his spiritual individuality. What was said isthat consciousness can disappear either fully or partially in the case of amaterialist, so that no conscious remains of his personality survive.Q. But surely this is annihilation?A. Certainly not. One can sleep a dead sleep and miss several stationsduring a long railway journey, without the slightest recollection orconsciousness, and awake at another station and continue the journey pastinnumerable other halting-places till the end of the journey or the goal isreached. Three kinds of sleep were mentioned to you: the dreamless, thechaotic, and the one which is so real, that to the sleeping man his dreamsbecome full realities. If you believe in the latter why can't you believe inthe former; according to the after-life a man has believed in and expected,such is the life he will have. He who expected no life to come will have anabsolute blank, amounting to annihilation, in the interval between the tworebirths. This is just the carrying out of the program we spoke of, aprogram created by the materialists themselves. But there are various kindsof materialists, as you say. A selfish, wicked Egoist, one who never shed atear for anyone but himself, thus adding entire indifference to the wholeworld to his unbelief, must, at the threshold of death, drop his personalityforever. This personality having no tendrils of sympathy for the worldaround and hence nothing to hook onto Sutratman, it follows that with thelast breath every connection between the two is broken. There being noDevachan for such a materialist, the Sutratman will reincarnate almostimmediately. But those materialists who erred in nothing but their disbeliefwill oversleep but one station. And the time will come when thatex-materialist will perceive himself in the Eternity and perhaps repent thathe lost even one day, one station, from the life eternal.Q. Still, would it not be more correct to say that death is birth into a newlife, or a return once more into eternity?A. You may if you like. Only remember that births differ, and that there arebirths of \"still-born\" beings, which are failures of nature. Moreover, withyour Western fixed ideas about material life, the words living and being arequite inapplicable to the pure subjective state of postmortem existence. Itis just because, save in a few philosophers who are not read by the many,and who themselves are too confused to present a distinct picture of it, itis just because your Western ideas of life and death have finally become sonarrow, that on the one hand they have led to crass materialism, and on theother, to the still more material conception of the other life, which theSpiritualists have formulated in their Summerland. There the souls of meneat, drink, marry, and live in a paradise quite as sensual as that ofMohammed, but even less philosophical. Nor are the average conceptions ofthe uneducated Christians any better, being if possible still more material.What between truncated angels, brass trumpets, golden harps, and materialhellfires, the Christian heaven seems like a fairy scene at a Christmaspantomime.Page 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtIt is because of these narrow conceptions that you find such difficulty inunderstanding. It is just because the life of the disembodied soul, whilepossessing all the vividness of reality, as in certain dreams, is devoid ofevery grossly objective form of terrestrial life, that the Easternphilosophers have compared it with visions during sleep.  -oOo-Definite Words for Definite ThingsQ. Don't you think it is because there are no definite and fixed terms toindicate each principle in man, that such a confusion of ideas arises in ourminds with respect to the respective functions of these principles?A. I have thought of it myself. The whole trouble has arisen from this: wehave started our expositions of, and discussion about, the principles, usingtheir Sanskrit names instead of coining immediately, for the use ofTheosophists, their equivalents in English. We must try and remedy this now.Q. You will do well, as it may avoid further confusion; no two theosophicalwriters, it seems to me, have hitherto agreed to call the same principle bythe same name.A. The confusion is more apparent than real, however. I have heard some ofour Theosophists express surprise at, and criticize several essays speakingof these principles; but, when examined, there was no worse mistake in themthan that of using the word Soul to cover the three principles withoutspecifying the distinctions. The first, as positively the clearest of ourTheosophical writers, Mr. A.P. Sinnett, has some comprehensive andadmirably-written passages on the \"Higher Self.\" His real idea has also beenmisconceived by some, owing to his using the word Soul in a general sense.Yet here are a few passages which will show to you how clear andcomprehensive is all that he writes on the subject:The human soul, once launched on the streams of evolution as a humanindividuality, passes through alternate periods of physical and relativelyspiritual existence. It passes from the one plane, or stratum, or conditionof nature to the other under the guidance of its Karmic affinities; livingin incarnations the life which its Karma has preordained; modifying itsprogress within the limitations of circumstances, and-developing fresh Karmaby its use or abuse of opportunities-it returns to spiritual existence(Devachan) after each physical life-through the intervening region ofKamaloka-for rest and refreshment and for the gradual absorption into itsessence, as so much cosmic progress, of the life's experience gained \"onearth\" or during physical existence. This view of the matter will, moreover,have suggested many collateral inferences to anyone thinking over thesubject; for instance, that the transfer of consciousness from the Kamalokato the Devachanic stage of this progression would necessarily be gradual;that in truth, no hard-and-fast line separates the varieties of spiritualconditions, that even the spiritual and physical planes, as psychicfaculties in living people show, are not so hopelessly walled off from oneanother as materialistic theories would suggest; that all states of natureare all around us simultaneously, and appeal to different perceptivefaculties; and so on ... It is clear that during physical existence people whopossess psychic faculties remain in connection with the planes ofsuper-physical consciousness; and although most people may not be endowedwith such faculties, we all, as the phenomena of sleep, even, and especially... those of somnambulism or mesmerism, show, are capable of entering intoconditions of consciousness that the five physical senses have nothing to dowith. We-the souls within us-are not as it were altogether adrift in theocean of matter. We clearly retain some surviving interest or rights in theshore from which, for a time, we have floated off. The process ofincarnation, therefore, is not fully described when we speak of an alternateexistence on the physical and spiritual planes, and thus picture the soul asPage 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txta complete entity slipping entirely from the one state of existence to theother. The more correct definitions of the process would probably representincarnation as taking place on this physical plane of nature by reason of anefflux emanating from the soul. The Spiritual realm would all the while bethe proper habitat of the Soul, which would never entirely quit it; and thatnon-materializable portion of the Soul which abides permanently on thespiritual plane may fitly, perhaps, be spoken of as the Higher Self.This \"Higher Self\" is Atma, and of course it is \"non-materializable,\" as Mr.Sinnett says. Even more, it can never be \"objective\" under anycircumstances, even to the highest spiritual perception. For Atma or the\"Higher Self\" is really Brahma, the Absolute, and indistinguishable from it.In hours of Samadhi, the higher spiritual consciousness of the Initiate isentirely absorbed in the one essence, which is Atma, and therefore, beingone with the whole, there can be nothing objective for it. Now some of ourTheosophists have got into the habit of using the words Self and Ego assynonymous, of associating the term Self with only man's higher individualor even personal \"Self\" or Ego, whereas this term ought never to be appliedexcept to the One universal Self. Hence the confusion. Speaking of Manas,the \"causal body,\" we may call it-when connecting it with the Buddhicradiance-the \"Higher Ego,\" never the \"Higher Self.\" For even Buddhi, the\"Spiritual Soul,\" is not the Self, but the vehicle only of Self. All theother \"Selves\"-such as the \"Individual\" self and \"personal\" self-ought neverto be spoken or written of without their qualifying and characteristicadjectives.Thus in this most excellent essay on the \"Higher Self,\" this term is appliedto the sixth principle or Buddhi; and has in consequence given rise to justsuch misunderstandings. The statement thatA child does not acquire its sixth principle-or become a morally responsiblebeing capable of generating Karma-until seven years old.-proves what is meant therein by the Higher Self. Therefore, the able authoris quite justified in explaining that after the \"Higher Self\" has passedinto the human being and saturated the personality-in some of the finerorganizations only-with its consciousnessPeople with psychic faculties may indeed perceive this Higher Self throughtheir finer senses from time to time.But so are those, who limit the term Higher Self to the Universal DivinePrinciple, \"justified\" in misunderstanding him. For, when we read, withoutbeing prepared for this shifting of metaphysical terms, that whileFully manifesting on the physical plane ... the Higher Self still remains aconscious spiritual Ego on the corresponding plane of Nature.We are apt to see in the \"Higher Self\" of this sentence, Atma, and in thespiritual Ego, Manas, or rather Buddhi-Manas, and forthwith to criticize thewhole thing as incorrect.To avoid henceforth such misapprehensions, I propose to translate literallyfrom the Occult Eastern terms their equivalents in English, and offer thesefor future use.[The Self and the Egos ]The Higher Self is Atma, the inseparable ray of the Universal and One Self.It is the God above, more than within, us. Happy the man who succeeds insaturating his inner Ego with it!The Spiritual divine Ego is the Spiritual soul or Buddhi, in close unionwith Manas, the mind-principle, without which it is no Ego at all, but onlyPage 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtthe Atmic Vehicle.The Inner, or Higher \"Ego\" is Manas, the \"Fifth\" Principle, so-called,independently of Buddhi. The Mind-Principle is only the Spiritual Ego whenmerged into one with Buddhi-no materialist being supposed to have in himsuch an Ego, however great his intellectual capacities. It is the permanentIndividuality or the \"Reincarnating Ego.\"The Lower, or Personal \"Ego\" is the physical man in conjunction with hislower Self, i.e., animal instincts, passions, desires, etc. It is called the\"false personality,\" and consists of the lower Manas combined with Kamarupa,and operating through the Physical body and its phantom or \"double.\"The remaining principle Prana, or Life, is, strictly speaking, the radiatingforce or Energy of Atma-as the Universal Life and the One Self-Its lower orrather (in its effects) more physical, because manifesting, aspect. Prana orLife permeates the whole being of the objective Universe; and is called aprinciple only because it is an indispensable factor and the deus ex machinaof the living man.Q. This division being so much simplified in its combinations will answerbetter, I believe. The other is much too metaphysical.A. If outsiders as well as Theosophists would agree to it, it wouldcertainly make matters much more comprehensible.On the Nature of Our Thinking Principle  The Mystery of the EgoQ. I perceive in the quotation you brought forward a little while ago fromThe Buddhist Catechism a discrepancy that I would like to hear explained. Itis there stated that the Skandhas-memory included-change with every newincarnation. And yet, it is asserted that the reflection of the past lives,which, we are told, are entirely made up of Skandhas, \"must survive.\" At thepresent moment I am not quite clear in my mind as to what it is preciselythat survives, and I would like to have it explained. What is it? Is it onlythat \"reflection,\" or those Skandhas, or always that same Ego, the Manas?A. I have just explained that the reincarnating Principle, or that which wecall the divine man, is indestructible throughout the life cycle:indestructible as a thinking Entity, and even as an ethereal form. The\"reflection\" is only the spiritualized remembrance, during the Devachanicperiod, of the ex-personality, Mr. A. or Mrs. B.-with which the Egoidentifies itself during that period. Since the latter is but thecontinuation of the earth-life, so to say, the very acme and pitch, in anunbroken series, of the few happy moments in that now past existence, theEgo has to identify itself with the personal consciousness of that life, ifanything shall remain of it.Q. This means that the Ego, notwithstanding its divine nature, passes everysuch period between two incarnations in a state of mental obscuration, ortemporary insanity.A. You may regard it as you like. Believing that, outside the One Reality,nothing is better than a passing illusion-the whole Universe included-we donot view it as insanity, but as a very natural sequence or development ofthe terrestrial life. What is life? A bundle of the most varied experiences,of daily changing ideas, emotions, and opinions. In our youth we are oftenenthusiastically devoted to an ideal, to some hero or heroine whom we try tofollow and revive; a few years later, when the freshness of our youthfulfeelings has faded out and sobered down, we are the first to laugh at ourfancies. And yet there was a day when we had so thoroughly identified ourown personality with that of the ideal in our mind-especially if it was thatPage 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtof a living being-that the former was entirely merged and lost in thelatter. Can it be said of a man of fifty that he is the same being that hewas at twenty? The inner man is the same; the outward living personality iscompletely transformed and changed. Would you also call these changes in thehuman mental states insanity?Q. How would you name them, and especially how would you explain thepermanence of one and the evanescence of the other?A. We have our own doctrine ready, and to us it offers no difficulty. Theclue lies in the double consciousness of our mind, and also, in the dualnature of the mental principle. There is a spiritual consciousness, theManasic mind illumined by the light of Buddhi, that which subjectivelyperceives abstractions; and the sentient consciousness (the lower Manasiclight), inseparable from our physical brain and senses. This latterconsciousness is held in subjection by the brain and physical senses, and,being in its turn equally dependent on them, must of course fade out andfinally die with the disappearance of the brain and physical senses. It isonly the former kind of consciousness, whose root lies in eternity, whichsurvives and lives forever, and may, therefore, be regarded as immortal.Everything else belongs to passing illusions.Q. What do you really understand by illusion in this case?A. It is very well described in the just-mentioned essay on \"The HigherSelf.\" Says its author:The theory we are considering (the interchange of ideas between the HigherEgo and the lower self) harmonizes very well with the treatment of thisworld in which we live as a phenomenal world of illusion, the spiritualplane of nature being on the other hand the noumenal world or plane ofreality. That region of nature in which, so to speak, the permanent soul isrooted is more real than that in which its transitory blossoms appear for abrief space to wither and fall to pieces, while the plant recovers energyfor sending forth a fresh flower. Supposing flowers only were perceptible toordinary senses, and their roots existed in a state of Nature intangible andinvisible to us, philosophers in such a world who divined that there weresuch things as roots in another plane of existence would be apt to say ofthe flowers: \"These are not the real plants; they are of no relativeimportance, merely illusive phenomena of the moment.\"This is what I mean. The world in which blossom the transitory andevanescent flowers of personal lives is not the real permanent world; butthat one in which we find the root of consciousness, that root which isbeyond illusion and dwells in the eternity.Q. What do you mean by the root dwelling in eternity?A. I mean by this root the thinking entity, the Ego which incarnates,whether we regard it as an \"Angel,\" \"Spirit,\" or a Force. Of that whichfalls under our sensuous perceptions only what grows directly from, or isattached to this invisible root above, can partake of its immortal life.Hence every noble thought, idea, and aspiration of the personality itinforms, proceeding from and fed by this root, must become permanent. As tothe physical consciousness, as it is a quality of the sentient but lowerprinciple, (Kamarupa or animal instinct, illuminated by the lower manasicreflection), or the human Soul-it must disappear. That which displaysactivity, while the body is asleep or paralyzed, is the higherconsciousness, our memory registering but feebly and inaccurately-becauseautomatically-such experiences, and often failing to be even slightlyimpressed by them.Q. But how is it that Manas, although you call it Nous, a \"God,\" is so weakduring its incarnations, as to be actually conquered and fettered by itsPage 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtbody?A. I might retort with the same question and ask:How is it that he, whom you regard as \"the God of Gods\" and the One livingGod, is so weak as to allow evil (or the Devil) to have the best of him asmuch as of all his creatures, whether while he remains in Heaven, or duringthe time he was incarnated on this earth?You are sure to reply again: \"This is a Mystery; and we are forbidden to pryinto the mysteries of God.\" Not being forbidden to do so by our religiousphilosophy, I answer your question that, unless a God descends as anAvatara, no divine principle can be otherwise than cramped and paralyzed byturbulent, animal matter. Heterogeneity will always have the upper hand overhomogeneity, on this plane of illusions, and the nearer an essence is to itsroot-principle, Primordial Homogeneity, the more difficult it is for thelatter to assert itself on earth. Spiritual and divine powers lie dormant inevery human Being; and the wider the sweep of his spiritual vision themightier will be the God within him. But as few men can feel that God, andsince, as an average rule, deity is always bound and limited in our thoughtby earlier conceptions, those ideas that are inculcated in us fromchildhood, therefore, it is so difficult for you to understand ourphilosophy.Q. And is it this Ego of ours which is our God?A. Not at all; \"A God\" is not the universal deity, but only a spark from theone ocean of Divine Fire. Our God within us, or \"our Father in Secret\" iswhat we call the Higher Self, Atma. Our incarnating Ego was a God in itsorigin, as were all the primeval emanations of the One Unknown Principle.But since its \"fall into Matter,\" having to incarnate throughout the cycle,in succession, from first to last, it is no longer a free and happy god, buta poor pilgrim on his way to regain that which he has lost. I can answer youmore fully by repeating what is said of the Inner Man:From the remotest antiquity mankind as a whole have always been convinced ofthe existence of a personal spiritual entity within the personal physicalman. This inner entity was more or less divine, according to its proximityto the crown. The closer the union the more serene man's destiny, the lessdangerous the external conditions. This belief is neither bigotry norsuperstition, only an ever-present, instinctive feeling of the proximity ofanother spiritual and invisible world, which, though it be subjective to thesenses of the outward man, is perfectly objective to the inner ego.Furthermore, they believed that there are external and internal conditionswhich affect the determination of our will upon our actions. They rejectedfatalism, for fatalism implies a blind course of some still blinder power.But they believed in destiny or Karma, which from birth to death every manis weaving thread by thread around himself, as a spider does his cobweb; andthis destiny is guided by that presence termed by some the guardian angel,or our more intimate astral inner man, who is but too often the evil geniusof the man of flesh or the personality. Both these lead on Man, but one ofthem must prevail; and from the very beginning of the invisible affray thestern and implacable law of compensation and retribution steps in and takesits course, following faithfully the fluctuating of the conflict. When thelast strand is woven, and man is seemingly enwrapped in the net-work of hisown doing, then he finds himself completely under the empire of thisself-made destiny. It then either fixes him like the inert shell against theimmovable rock, or like a feather carries him away in a whirlwind raised byhis own actions.Such is the destiny of the Man-the true Ego, not the Automaton, the shellthat goes by that name. It is for him to become the conqueror over matter.  -oOo-Page 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtThe Complex Nature of ManasQ. But you wanted to tell me something of the essential nature of Manas, andof the relation in which the Skandhas of physical man stand to it?A. It is this nature, mysterious, Protean, beyond any grasp, and almostshadowy in its correlations with the other principles, that is mostdifficult to realize, and still more so to explain. Manas is a principle,and yet it is an \"Entity\" and individuality or Ego. He is a \"God,\" and yethe is doomed to an endless cycle of incarnations, for each of which he ismade responsible, and for each of which he has to suffer. All this seems ascontradictory as it is puzzling; nevertheless, there are hundreds of people,even in Europe, who realize all this perfectly, for they comprehend the Egonot only in its integrity but in its many aspects. Finally, if I would makemyself comprehensible, I must begin by the beginning and give you thegenealogy of this Ego in a few lines.Q. Say on.A. Try to imagine a \"Spirit,\" a celestial Being, whether we call it by onename or another, divine in its essential nature, yet not pure enough to beone with the All, and having, in order to achieve this, to do purify itsnature as to finally gain that goal. It can do so only by passingindividually and personally, i.e., spiritually and physically, through everyexperience and feeling that exists in the manifold or differentiatedUniverse. It has, therefore, after having gained such experience in thelower kingdoms, and having ascended higher and still higher with every rungon the ladder of being, to pass through every experience on the humanplanes. In its very essence it is thought, and is, therefore, called in itsplurality Manasaputra, \"the Sons of the (Universal) mind.\" Thisindividualized \"Thought\" is what we Theosophists call the real human Ego,the thinking Entity imprisoned in a case of flesh and bones. This is surelya Spiritual Entity, not Matter, and such Entities are the incarnating Egosthat inform the bundle of animal matter called mankind, and whose names areManasa or \"Minds.\" But once imprisoned, or incarnate, their essence becomesdual: that is to say, the rays of the eternal divine Mind, considered asindividual entities, assume a two-fold attribute which is (a) theiressential inherent characteristic, heaven-aspiring mind (higher Manas), and(b) the human quality of thinking, or animal cogitation, rationalized owingto the superiority of the human brain, the Kama-tending or lower Manas. Onegravitates toward Buddhi, the other, tending downward, to the seat ofpassions and animal desires. The latter have no room in Devachan, nor canthey associate with the divine triad which ascends as one into mental bliss.Yet it is the Ego, the Manasic Entity, which is held responsible for all thesins of the lower attributes, just as a parent is answerable for thetransgressions of his child, so long as the latter remains irresponsible.Q. Is this \"child\" the \"personality\"?A. It is. When, therefore, it is stated that the \"personality\" dies with thebody it does not state all. The body, which was only the objective symbol ofMr. A. or Mrs. B., fades away with all its material Skandhas, which are thevisible expressions thereof. But all that which constituted during life thespiritual bundle of experiences, the noblest aspirations, undyingaffections, and unselfish nature of Mr. A. or Mrs. B. clings for the time ofthe Devachanic period to the Ego, which is identified with the spiritualportion of that terrestrial Entity, now passed away out of sight. The Actoris so imbued with the role just played by him that he dreams of it duringthe whole Devachanic night, which vision continues till the hour strikes forhim to return to the stage of life to enact another part.Q. But how is it that this doctrine, which you say is as old as thinkingmen, has found no room, say, in Christian theology?Page 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. You are mistaken, it has; only theology has disfigured it out of allrecognition, as it has many other doctrines. Theology calls the Ego theAngel that God gives us at the moment of our birth, to take care of ourSoul. Instead of holding that \"Angel\" responsible for the transgressions ofthe poor helpless \"Soul,\" it is the latter which, according to theologicallogic, is punished for all the sins of both flesh and mind! It is the Soul,the immaterial breath of God and his alleged creation, which, by some mostamazing intellectual jugglery, is doomed to burn in a material hell withoutever being consumed, while the \"Angel\" escapes scot-free, after folding hiswhite pinions and wetting them with a few tears. Aye, these are our\"ministering Spirits,\" the \"messengers of mercy\" who are sent, Bishop Manttells us:... to fulfillGood for Salvation's heirs, for us they stillGrieve when we sin, rejoice when we repent ...Yet it becomes evident that if all the Bishops the world over were asked todefine once for all what they mean by Soul and its functions, they would beas unable to do so as to show us any shadow of logic in the orthodox belief!  -oOo-The Doctrine is Taught in St. John's GospelQ. To this the adherents to this belief might answer, that if even theorthodox dogma does promise the impenitent sinner and materialist a bad timeof it in a rather too realistic Inferno, it gives them, on the other hand, achance for repentance to the last minute. Nor do they teach annihilation, orloss of personality, which is all the same.A. If the Church teaches nothing of the kind, on the other hand, Jesus does;and that is something to those, at least, who place Christ higher thanChristianity.Q. Does Christ teach anything of the sort?A. He does; and every well-informed Occultist and even Cabalist will tellyou so. Christ, or the fourth Gospel at any rate, teaches reincarnation asalso the annihilation of the personality, if you but forget the dead letterand hold to the esoteric Spirit. Remember the parable spoken of by St. John.What does the parable speak about if not of the upper triad in man? Atma isthe Husbandman-the Spiritual Ego or Buddhi (Christos) the Vine, while theanimal and vital Soul, the personality, is the \"branch.\"I am the true vine, and my Father is the Husbandman. Every branch in me thatbeareth not fruit he taketh away ... As the branch cannot bear fruit of itselfexcept it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am theVine-ye are the branches. If a man abide not in me he is cast forth as abranch, and is withered and cast into the fire and burned.Now we explain it in this way. Disbelieving in the hellfire which theologydiscovers as underlying the threat to the branches, we say that the\"Husbandman\" means Atma, the Symbol for the infinite, impersonal Principle,while the Vine stands for the Spiritual Soul, Christos, and each \"branch\"represents a new incarnation.Q. But what proofs have you to support such an arbitrary interpretation? 1. Universal symbology is a warrant for its correctness and that it is not arbitrary. Hermas says of \"God\" that he \"planted the Vineyard,\" i.e.,Page 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txt he created mankind. In the Cabala, it is shown that the Aged of the Aged, or the \"Long Face,\" plants a vineyard, the latter typifying mankind; and a vine, meaning Life. The Spirit of \"King Messiah\" is, therefore, shown as washing his garments in the wine from above, from the creation of the world. [Zohar XL, 10] And King Messiah is the Ego purified by washing his garments (i.e., his personalities in rebirth), in the wine from above, or Buddhi. Adam, or A-Dam, is \"blood.\" The Life of the flesh is in the blood (nephesh-soul). And Adam-Kadmon is the Only-Begotten. Noah also plants a vineyard-the allegorical hotbed of future humanity. As a consequence of the adoption of the same allegory, we find it reproduced in the Nazarene Codex. Seven vines are procreated-which seven vines are our Seven Races with their seven Saviors or Buddhas-which spring from Iukabar Zivo, and Ferho (or Parcha) Raba waters them.[Codex Nazareus, iii, pp. 60,61] When the blessed will ascend among the creatures of Light, they shall see Iavar-Xivo, Lord of Life, and the First Vine.[Cod. Naz., ii, p.281] These Cabalistic metaphors are thus naturally repeated in the Gospel according to St. John.Let us not forget that in the human system-even according to thosephilosophies which ignore our septenary division-the Ego or thinking man iscalled the Logos, or the Son of Soul and Spirit. \"Manas is the adopted Sonof King *** and Queen ***\" (esoteric equivalents for Atma and Buddhi), saysan occult work. He is the \"man-god\" of Plato, who crucifies himself in Space(or the duration of the life cycle) for the redemption of Matter. This hedoes by incarnating over and over again, thus leading mankind onward toperfection, and making thereby room for lower forms to develop into higher.Not for one life does he cease progressing himself and helping all physicalnature to progress; even the occasional, very rare event of his losing oneof his personalities, in the case of the latter being entirely devoid ofeven a spark of spirituality, helps toward his individual progress.Q. But surely, if the Ego is held responsible for the transgressions of itspersonalities, it has to answer also for the loss, or rather the completeannihilation, of one of such.A. Not at all, unless it has done nothing to avert this dire fate. But if,all its efforts notwithstanding, its voice, that of our conscience, wasunable to penetrate through the wall of matter, then the obtuseness of thelatter proceeding from the imperfect nature of the material is classed withother failures of nature. The Ego is sufficiently punished by the loss ofDevachan, and especially by having to incarnate almost immediately.Q. This doctrine of the possibility of losing one's soul-or personality, doyou call it?-militates against the ideal theories of both Christians andSpiritualists, though Swedenborg adopts it to a certain extent, in what hecalls Spiritual death. They will never accept it.A. This can in no way alter a fact in nature, if it be a fact, or preventsuch a thing occasionally taking place. The universe and everything in it,moral, mental, physical, psychic, or Spiritual, is built on a perfect law ofequilibrium and harmony. As said before (see Isis Unveiled), the centripetalforce could not manifest itself without the centrifugal in the harmoniousrevolutions of the spheres, and all forms and their progress are theproducts of this dual force in nature. Now the Spirit (or Buddhi) is thecentrifugal and the soul (Manas) the centripetal spiritual energy; and toproduce one result they have to be in perfect union and harmony. Break ordamage the centripetal motion of the earthly soul tending toward the centerwhich attracts it; arrest its progress by clogging it with a heavier weightof matter than it can bear, or than is fit for the Devachanic state, and theharmony of the whole will be destroyed. Personal life, or perhaps rather itsideal reflection, can only be continued if sustained by the two-fold force,that is by the close union of Buddhi and Manas in every rebirth or personallife. The least deviation from harmony damages it; and when it is destroyedPage 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtbeyond redemption the two forces separate at the moment of death. During abrief interval the personal form (called indifferently Kamarupa andMayavirupa), the spiritual efflorescence of which, attaching itself to theEgo, follows it into Devachan and gives to the permanent individuality itspersonal coloring (pro tem, so to speak), is carried off to remain inKamaloka and to be gradually annihilated. For it is after the death of theutterly depraved, the unspiritual and the wicked beyond redemption, thatarrives the critical and supreme moment. If during life the ultimate anddesperate effort of the Inner Self (Manas), to unite something of thepersonality with itself and the high glimmering ray of the divine Buddhi, isthwarted; if this ray is allowed to be more and more shut out from theever-thickening crust of physical brain, the Spiritual Ego or Manas, oncefreed from the body, remains severed entirely from the ethereal relic of thepersonality; and the latter, or Kamarupa, following its earthly attractions,is drawn into and remains in Hades, which we call the Kamaloka. These are\"the withered branches\" mentioned by Jesus as being cut off from the Vine.Annihilation, however, is never instantaneous, and may require centuriessometimes for its accomplishment. But there the personality remains alongwith the remnants of other more fortunate personal Egos, and becomes withthem a shell and an Elementary. As said in Isis Unveiled, it is these twoclasses of \"Spirits,\" the shells and the Elementaries, which are the leading\"Stars\" on the great spiritual stage of \"materializations.\" And you may besure of it, it is not they who incarnate; and, therefore, so few of these\"dear departed ones\" know anything of reincarnation, misleading thereby theSpiritualists.Q. But does not the author of Isis Unveiled stand accused of having preachedagainst reincarnation?A. By those who have misunderstood what was said, yes. At the time that workwas written, reincarnation was not believed in by any Spiritualists, eitherEnglish or American, and what is said there of reincarnation was directedagainst the French Spiritists, whose theory is as unphilosophical and absurdas the Eastern teaching is logical and self-evident in its truth. TheReincarnationists of the Allan Kardec School believe in an arbitrary andimmediate reincarnation. With them, the dead father can incarnate in his ownunborn daughter, and so on. They have neither Devachan, Karma, nor anyphilosophy that would warrant or prove the necessity of consecutiverebirths. But how can the author of Isis Unveiled argue against Karmicreincarnation, at long intervals varying between 1,000 and 1,500 years, whenit is the fundamental belief of both Buddhists and Hindus?Q. Then you reject the theories of both the Spiritists and theSpiritualists, in their entirety?A. Not in their entirety, but only with regard to their respectivefundamental beliefs. Both rely on what their \"Spirits\" tell them; and bothdisagree as much with each other as we Theosophists disagree with both.Truth is one; and when we hear the French spooks preaching reincarnation,and the English spooks denying and denouncing the doctrine, we say thateither the French or the English \"Spirits\" do not know what they are talkingabout. We believe with the Spiritualists and the Spiritists in the existenceof \"Spirits,\" or invisible Beings endowed with more or less intelligence.But, while in our teachings their kinds and genera are legion, our opponentsadmit of no other than human disembodied \"Spirits,\" which, to our knowledge,are mostly Kamalokic Shells.Q. You seem very bitter against Spirits. As you have given me your views andyour reasons for disbelieving in the materialization of, and directcommunication in seances, with the disembodied spirits-or the \"spirits ofthe dead\"-would you mind enlightening me as to one more fact? Why are someTheosophists never tired of saying how dangerous is intercourse withspirits, and mediumship? Have they any particular reason for this?Page 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. We must suppose so. I know I have. Owing to my familiarity for over halfa century with these invisible, yet but too tangible and undeniable\"influences,\" from the conscious Elementals, semi-conscious shells, down tothe utterly senseless and nondescript spooks of all kinds, I claim a certainright to my views.Q. Can you give an instance or instances to show why these practices shouldbe regarded as dangerous?A. This would require more time than I can give you. Every cause must bejudged by the effects it produces. Go over the history of Spiritualism forthe last fifty years, ever since its reappearance in this century inAmerica-and judge for yourself whether it has done its votaries more good orharm. Pray understand me. I do not speak against real Spiritualism, butagainst the modern movement which goes under that name, and the so-calledphilosophy invented to explain its phenomena.Q. Don't you believe in their phenomena at all?A. It is because I believe in them with too good reason, and (save somecases of deliberate fraud) know them to be as true as that you and I live,that all my being revolts against them. Once more I speak only of physical,not mental or even psychic phenomena. Like attracts like. There are severalhigh-minded, pure, good men and women, known to me personally, who havepassed years of their lives under the direct guidance and even protection ofhigh \"Spirits,\" whether disembodied or planetary. But these Intelligencesare not of the type of the John Kings and the Ernests who figure in seancerooms. These Intelligences guide and control mortals only in rare andexceptional cases to which they are attracted and magnetically drawn by theKarmic past of the individual. It is not enough to sit \"for development\" inorder to attract them. That only opens the door to a swarm of \"spooks,\"good, bad, and indifferent, to which the medium becomes a slave for life. Itis against such promiscuous mediumship and intercourse with goblins that Iraise my voice, not against spiritual mysticism. The latter is ennobling andholy; the former is of just the same nature as the phenomena of twocenturies ago, for which so many witches and wizards have been made tosuffer. Read Glanvil and other authors on the subject of witchcraft, and youwill find recorded there the parallels of most, if not all, of the physicalphenomena of nineteenth century \"Spiritualism.\"Q. Do you mean to suggest that it is all witchcraft and nothing more?A. What I mean is that, whether conscious or unconscious, all this dealingwith the dead is necromancy, and a most dangerous practice. For ages beforeMoses such raising of the dead was regarded by all the intelligent nationsas sinful and cruel, inasmuch as it disturbs the rest of the souls andinterferes with their evolutionary development into higher states. Thecollective wisdom of all past centuries has ever been loud in denouncingsuch practices. Finally, I say, what I have never ceased repeating orallyand in print for fifteen years: While some of the so-called \"spirits\" do notknow what they are talking about, repeating merely-like poll-parrots-whatthey find in the mediums' and other people's brains, others are mostdangerous, and can only lead one to evil. These are two self-evident facts.Go into Spiritualistic circles of the Allan Kardec school, and you find\"spirits\" asserting reincarnation and speaking like Roman Catholics born.Turn to the \"dear departed ones\" in England and America, and you will hearthem denying reincarnation through thick and thin, denouncing those whoteach it, and holding to Protestant views. Your best, your most powerfulmediums, have all suffered in health of body and mind. Think of the sad endof Charles Foster, who died in an asylum, a raving lunatic; of Slade, anepileptic; of Eglinton-the best medium now in England-subject to the same.Look back over the life of D.D. Home, a man whose mind was steeped in galland bitterness, who never had a good word to say of anyone whom he suspectedof possessing psychic powers, and who slandered every other medium to thePage 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtbitter end. This Calvin of Spiritualism suffered for years from a terriblespinal disease, brought on by his intercourse with the \"spirits,\" and died aperfect wreck. Think again of the sad fate of poor Washington Irving Bishop.I knew him in New York, when he was fourteen, and he was undeniably amedium. It is true that the poor man stole a march on his \"spirits,\" andbaptized them \"unconscious muscular action,\" to the great gaudium of all thecorporations of highly learned and scientific fools, and to thereplenishment of his own pocket. But de mortuis nil nisi bonum; his end wasa sad one. He had strenuously concealed his epileptic fits-the first andstrongest symptom of genuine mediumship-and who knows whether he was dead orin a trance when the postmortem examination was performed? His relativesinsist that he was alive, if we are to believe Reuter's telegrams. Finally,behold the veteran mediums, the founders and prime movers of modernspiritualism-the Fox sisters. After more than forty years of intercoursewith the \"Angels,\" the latter have led them to become incurable sots, whoare now denouncing, in public lectures, their own life-long work andphilosophy as a fraud. What kind of spirits must they be who prompted them,I ask you?Q. But is your inference a correct one?A. What would you infer if the best pupils of a particular school of singingbroke down from overstrained sore throats? That the method followed was abad one. So I think the inference is equally fair with regard toSpiritualism when we see their best mediums fall a prey to such a fate. Wecan only say: Let those who are interested in the question judge the tree ofSpiritualism by its fruits, and ponder over the lesson. We Theosophists havealways regarded the Spiritualists as brothers having the same mystictendency as ourselves, but they have always regarded us as enemies. We,being in possession of an older philosophy, have tried to help and warnthem; but they have repaid us by reviling and traducing us and our motivesin every possible way. Nevertheless, the best English Spiritualists say justas we do, wherever they treat of their belief seriously. Hear \"M.A. Oxon\"confessing this truth:Spiritualists are too much inclined to dwell exclusively on the interventionof external spirits in this world of ours, and to ignore the powers of theincarnate Spirit.Why vilify and abuse us, then, for saying precisely the same? Henceforward,we will have nothing more to do with Spiritualism. And now let us return toReincarnation.On the Mysteries of Reincarnation  Periodical RebirthsQ. You mean, then, that we have all lived on earth before, in many pastincarnations, and shall go on so living?A. I do. The life cycle, or rather the cycle of conscious life, begins withthe separation of the mortal animal-man into sexes, and will end with theclose of the last generation of men, in the seventh round and seventh raceof mankind. Considering we are only in the fourth round and fifth race, itsduration is more easily imagined than expressed.Q. And we keep on incarnating in new personalities all the time?A. Most assuredly so; because this life cycle or period of incarnation maybe best compared to human life. As each such life is composed of days ofactivity separated by nights of sleep or of inaction, so, in the incarnationcycle, an active life is followed by a Devachanic rest.Q. And it is this succession of births that is generally defined asPage 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtreincarnation?A. Just so. It is only through these births that the perpetual progress ofthe countless millions of Egos toward final perfection and final rest (aslong as was the period of activity) can be achieved.Q. And what is it that regulates the duration, or special qualities of theseincarnations?A. Karma, the universal law of retributive justice.Q. Is it an intelligent law?A. For the Materialist, who calls the law of periodicity which regulates themarshaling of the several bodies, and all the other laws in nature, blindforces and mechanical laws, no doubt Karma would be a law of chance and nomore. For us, no adjective or qualification could describe that which isimpersonal and no entity, but a universal operative law. If you question meabout the causative intelligence in it, I must answer you I do not know. Butif you ask me to define its effects and tell you what these are in ourbelief, I may say that the experience of thousands of ages has shown us thatthey are absolute and unerring equity, wisdom, and intelligence. For Karmain its effects is an unfailing redresser of human injustice, and of all thefailures of nature; a stern adjuster of wrongs; a retributive law whichrewards and punishes with equal impartiality. It is, in the strictest sense,\"no respecter of persons,\" though, on the other hand, it can neither bepropitiated, nor turned aside by prayer. This is a belief common to Hindusand Buddhists, who both believe in Karma.Q. In this Christian dogmas contradict both, and I doubt whether anyChristian will accept the teaching.A. No; and Inman gave the reason for it many years ago. As he puts it, while... the Christians will accept any nonsense, if promulgated by the Church as amatter of faith ... the Buddhists hold that nothing which is contradicted bysound reason can be a true doctrine of Buddha.They do not believe in any pardon for their sins, except after an adequateand just punishment for each evil deed or thought in a future incarnation,and a proportionate compensation to the parties injured.Q. Where is it so stated?A. In most of their sacred works. Consider the following Theosophical tenet:Buddhists believe that every act, word, or thought has its consequence,which will appear sooner or later in the present or in the future state.Evil acts will produce evil consequences, good acts will produce goodconsequences: prosperity in this world, or birth in heaven (Devachan) ... inthe future state.Q. Christians believe the same thing, don't they?A. Oh, no; they believe in the pardon and the remission of all sins. Theyare promised that if they only believe in the blood of Christ (an innocentvictim!), in the blood offered by Him for the expiation of the sins of thewhole of mankind, it will atone for every mortal sin. And we believe neitherin vicarious atonement, nor in the possibility of the remission of thesmallest sin by any god, not even by a \"personal Absolute\" or \"Infinite,\" ifsuch a thing could have any existence. What we believe in, is strict andimpartial justice. Our idea of the unknown Universal Deity, represented byKarma, is that it is a Power which cannot fail, and can, therefore, haveneither wrath nor mercy, only absolute Equity, which leaves every cause,Page 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtgreat or small, to work out its inevitable effects. The saying of Jesus:\"With what measure you mete it shall be measured to you again,\" neither byexpression nor implication points to any hope of future mercy or salvationby proxy. This is why, recognizing as we do in our philosophy the justice ofthis statement, we cannot recommend too strongly mercy, charity, andforgiveness of mutual offenses. Resist not evil, and render good for evil,are Buddhist precepts, and were first preached in view of the implacabilityof Karmic law. For man to take the law into his own hands is anyhow asacrilegious presumption. Human Law may use restrictive not punitivemeasures; but a man who, believing in Karma, still revenges himself andrefuses to forgive every injury, thereby rendering good for evil, is acriminal and only hurts himself. As Karma is sure to punish the man whowronged him, by seeking to inflict an additional punishment on his enemy,he, who instead of leaving that punishment to the great Law adds to it hisown mite, only begets thereby a cause for the future reward of his own enemyand a future punishment for himself. The unfailing Regulator affects in eachincarnation the quality of its successor; and the sum of the merit ordemerit in preceding ones determines it.Q. Are we then to infer a man's past from his present?A. Only so far as to believe that his present life is what it justly shouldbe, to atone for the sins of the past life. Of course-seers and great adeptsexcepted-we cannot as average mortals know what those sins were. From ourpaucity of data, it is impossible for us even to determine what an old man'syouth must have been; neither can we, for like reasons, draw finalconclusions merely from what we see in the life of some man, as to what hispast life may have been.  -oOo-What is Karma?Q. But what is Karma?A. As I have said, we consider it as the Ultimate Law of the Universe, thesource, origin, and fount of all other laws which exist throughout Nature.Karma is the unerring law which adjusts effect to cause, on the physical,mental, and spiritual planes of being. As no cause remains without its dueeffect from greatest to least, from a cosmic disturbance down to themovement of your hand, and as like produces like, Karma is that unseen andunknown law which adjusts wisely, intelligently, and equitably each effectto its cause, tracing the latter back to its producer. Though itselfunknowable, its action is perceivable.Q. Then it is the \"Absolute,\" the \"Unknowable\" again, and is not of muchvalue as an explanation of the problems of life?A. On the contrary. For, though we do not know what Karma is per se, and inits essence, we do know how it works, and we can define and describe itsmode of action with accuracy. We only do not know its ultimate Cause, justas modern philosophy universally admits that the ultimate Cause of anythingis \"unknowable.\"Q. And what has Theosophy to say in regard to the solution of the morepractical needs of humanity? What is the explanation which it offers inreference to the awful suffering and dire necessity prevalent among theso-called \"lower classes.\"A. To be pointed, according to our teaching all these great social evils,the distinction of classes in Society, and of the sexes in the affairs oflife, the unequal distribution of capital and of labor-all are due to whatwe tersely but truly denominate Karma.Page 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. But, surely, all these evils which seem to fall upon the masses somewhatindiscriminately are not actual merited and individual Karma?A. No, they cannot be so strictly defined in their effects as to show thateach individual environment, and the particular conditions of life in whicheach person finds himself, are nothing more than the retributive Karma whichthe individual generated in a previous life. We must not lose sight of thefact that every atom is subject to the general law governing the whole bodyto which it belongs, and here we come upon the wider track of the Karmiclaw. Do you not perceive that the aggregate of individual Karma becomes thatof the nation to which those individuals belong, and further, that thesumtotal of National Karma is that of the World? The evils that you speak ofare not peculiar to the individual or even to the Nation, they are more orless universal; and it is upon this broad line of Human interdependence thatthe law of Karma finds its legitimate and equable issue.Q. Do I, then, understand that the law of Karma is not necessarily anindividual law?A. That is just what I mean. It is impossible that Karma could readjust thebalance of power in the world's life and progress, unless it had a broad andgeneral line of action. It is held as a truth among Theosophists that theinterdependence of Humanity is the cause of what is called DistributiveKarma, and it is this law which affords the solution to the great questionof collective suffering and its relief. It is an occult law, moreover, thatno man can rise superior to his individual failings, without lifting, be itever so little, the whole body of which he is an integral part. In the sameway, no one can sin, nor suffer the effects of sin, alone. In reality, thereis no such thing as \"Separateness\"; and the nearest approach to that selfishstate, which the laws of life permit, is in the intent or motive.Q. And are there no means by which the distributive or national Karma mightbe concentrated or collected, so to speak, and brought to its natural andlegitimate fulfillment without all this protracted suffering?A. As a general rule, and within certain limits which define the age towhich we belong, the law of Karma cannot be hastened or retarded in itsfulfillment. But of this I am certain, the point of possibility in either ofthese directions has never yet been touched. Listen to the following recitalof one phase of national suffering, and then ask yourself whether, admittingthe working power of individual, relative, and distributive Karma, theseevils are not capable of extensive modification and general relief. What Iam about to read to you is from the pen of a National Savior, one who,having overcome Self, and being free to choose, has elected to serveHumanity, in bearing at least as much as a woman's shoulders can possiblybear of National Karma. This is what she says:Yes, Nature always does speak, don't you think? only sometimes we make somuch noise that we drown her voice. That is why it is so restful to go outof the town and nestle awhile in the Mother's arms. I am thinking of theevening on Hampstead Heath when we watched the sun go down; but oh! uponwhat suffering and misery that sun had set! A lady brought me yesterday abig hamper of wild flowers. I thought some of my East-end family had abetter right to it than I, and so I took it down to a very poor school inWhitechapel this morning. You should have seen the pallid little facesbrighten! Thence I went to pay for some dinners at a little cookshop forsome children. It was in a back street, narrow, full of jostling people;stench indescribable, from fish, meat, and other food, all reeking in a sunthat, in Whitechapel, festers instead of purifying. The cookshop was thequintessence of all the smells. Indescribable meat-pies at 1d., loathsomelumps of 'food' and swarms of flies, a very altar of Beelzebub! All about,babies on the prowl for scraps, one, with the face of an angel, gathering upcherrystones as a light and nutritious form of diet. I came westward withevery nerve shuddering and jarred, wondering whether anything can be donePage 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtwith some parts of London save swallowing them up in an earthquake andstarting their inhabitants afresh, after a plunge into some purifying Lethe,out of which not a memory might emerge! And then I thought of HampsteadHeath, and-pondered. If by any sacrifice one could win the power to savethese people, the cost would not be worth counting; but, you see, they mustbe changed-and how can that be wrought? In the condition they now are, theywould not profit by any environment in which they might be placed; and yet,in their present surroundings they must continue to putrefy. It breaks myheart, this endless, hopeless misery, and the brutish degradation that is atonce its outgrowth and its root. It is like the banyan tree; every branchroots itself and sends out new shoots. What a difference between thesefeelings and the peaceful scene at Hampstead! and yet we, who are thebrothers and sisters of these poor creatures, have only a right to useHampstead Heaths to gain strength to save Whitechapels.Q. That is a sad but beautiful letter, and I think it presents with painfulconspicuity the terrible workings of what you have called \"Relative andDistributive Karma.\" But alas! there seems no immediate hope of any reliefshort of an earthquake, or some such general engulfment!A. What right have we to think so while one-half of humanity is in aposition to effect an immediate relief of the privations which are sufferedby their fellows? When every individual has contributed to the general goodwhat he can of money, of labor, and of ennobling thought, then, and onlythen, will the balance of National Karma be struck, and until then we haveno right nor any reasons for saying that there is more life on the earththan Nature can support. It is reserved for the heroic souls, the Saviors ofour Race and Nation, to find out the cause of this unequal pressure ofretributive Karma, and by a supreme effort to readjust the balance of power,and save the people from a moral engulfment a thousand times more disastrousand more permanently evil than the like physical catastrophe, in which youseem to see the only possible outlet for this accumulated misery.Q. Well, then, tell me generally how you describe this law of Karma?A. We describe Karma as that Law of readjustment which ever tends to restoredisturbed equilibrium in the physical, and broken harmony in the moralworld. We say that Karma does not act in this or that particular way always;but that it always does act so as to restore Harmony and preserve thebalance of equilibrium, in virtue of which the Universe exists.Q. Give me an illustration.A. Later on I will give you a full illustration. Think now of a pond. Astone falls into the water and creates disturbing waves. These wavesoscillate backwards and forwards till at last, owing to the operation ofwhat physicists call the law of the dissipation of energy, they are broughtto rest, and the water returns to its condition of calm tranquility.Similarly all action, on every plane, produces disturbance in the balancedharmony of the Universe, and the vibrations so produced will continue toroll backwards and forwards, if its area is limited, till equilibrium isrestored. But since each such disturbance starts from some particular point,it is clear that equilibrium and harmony can only be restored by thereconverging to that same point of all the forces which were set in motionfrom it. And here you have proof that the consequences of a man's deeds,thoughts, etc. must all react upon himself with the same force with whichthey were set in motion.Q. But I see nothing of a moral character about this law. It looks to melike the simple physical law that action and reaction are equal andopposite.A. I am not surprised to hear you say that. Europeans have got so much intothe ingrained habit of considering right and wrong, good and evil, asPage 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtmatters of an arbitrary code of law laid down either by men, or imposed uponthem by a Personal God. We Theosophists, however, say that \"Good\" and\"Harmony,\" and \"Evil\" and \"Dis-harmony,\" are synonymous. Further we maintainthat all pain and suffering are results of want of Harmony, and that the oneterrible and only cause of the disturbance of Harmony is selfishness in someform or another. Hence Karma gives back to every man the actual consequencesof his own actions, without any regard to their moral character; but sincehe receives his due for all, it is obvious that he will be made to atone forall sufferings which he has caused, just as he will reap in joy and gladnessthe fruits of all the happiness and harmony he had helped to produce. I cando no better than quote for your benefit certain passages from books andarticles written by our Theosophists-those who have a correct idea of Karma.Q. I wish you would, as your literature seers to be very sparing on thissubject?A. Because it is the most difficult of all our tenets. Some short time agothere appeared the following objection from a Christian pen:Granting that the teaching in regard to Theosophy is correct, and that \"manmust be his own savior, must overcome self and conquer the evil that is inhis dual nature, to obtain the emancipation of his soul,\" what is man to doafter he has been awakened and converted to a certain extent from evil orwickedness? How is he to get emancipation, or pardon, or the blotting out ofthe evil or wickedness he has already done?To this Mr. J.H. Conelly replies very pertinently that no one can hope to\"make the theosophical engine run on the theological track.\" As he has it:The possibility of shirking individual responsibility is not among theconcepts of Theosophy. In this faith there is no such thing as pardoning, or\"blotting out of evil or wickedness already done,\" otherwise than by theadequate punishment therefore of the wrong-doer and the restoration of theharmony in the universe that had been disturbed by his wrongful act. Theevil has been his own, and while others must suffer its consequences,atonement can be made by nobody but himself.The condition contemplated ... in which a man shall have been \"awakened andconverted to a certain extent from evil or wickedness,\" is that in which aman shall have realized that his deeds are evil and deserving of punishment.In that realization a sense of personal responsibility is inevitable, andjust in proportion to the extent of his awakening or \"converting\" must bethe sense of that awful responsibility. While it is strong upon him is thetime when he is urged to accept the doctrine of vicarious atonement.He is told that he must also repent, but nothing is easier than that. It isan amiable weakness of human nature that we are quite prone to regret theevil we have done when our attention is called, and we have either sufferedfrom it ourselves or enjoyed its fruits. Possibly, close analysis of thefeeling would show us that thing which we regret is rather the necessitythat seemed to require the evil as a means of attainment of our selfish endsthan the evil itself.Attractive as this prospect of casting our burden of sins \"at the foot ofthe cross\" may be to the ordinary mind, it does not commend itself to theTheosophic student. He does not apprehend why the sinner by attainingknowledge of his evil can thereby merit any pardon for or the blotting outof his past wickedness; or why repentance and future right living entitlehim to a suspension in his favor of the universal law of relation betweencause and effect. The results of his evil deeds continue to exist; thesuffering caused to others by his wickedness is not blotted out. TheTheosophical student takes the result of wickedness upon the innocent intohis problem. He considers not only the guilty person, but his victims.Page 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtEvil is an infraction of the laws of harmony governing the universe, and thepenalty thereof must fall upon the violator of that law himself. Christuttered the warning, \"Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon thee,\" andSt. Paul said, \"Work out your own salvation. Whatsoever a man soweth, thatshall he also reap.\" That, by the way, is a fine metaphoric rendering of thesentence of the Pur as far antedating him-that \"every man reaps theconsequences of his own acts.\"This is the principle of the law of Karma which is taught by Theosophy.Sinnett, in his Esoteric Buddhism, rendered Karma as \"the law of ethicalcausation.\" \"The law of retribution,\" as Mme. Blavatsky translates itsmeaning, is better. It is the power whichJust though mysterious, leads us on unerring Through ways unmarked from guilt to punishment.But it is more. It rewards merit as unerringly and amply as it punishesdemerit. It is the outcome of every act, of thought, word, and deed, and byit men mold themselves, their lives and happenings. Eastern philosophyrejects the idea of a newly created soul for every baby born. It believes ina limited number of monads, evolving and growing more and more perfectthrough their assimilation of many successive personalities. Thosepersonalities are the product of Karma and it is by Karma and reincarnationthat the human monad in time returns to its source-absolute deity.E.D. Walker, in his Reincarnation, offers the following explanation:Briefly, the doctrine of Karma is that we have made ourselves what we are byformer actions, and are building our future eternity by present actions.There is no destiny but what we ourselves determine. There is no salvationor condemnation except what we ourselves bring about ... Because it offers noshelter for culpable actions and necessitates a sterling manliness, it isless welcome to weak natures than the easy religious tenets of vicariousatonement, intercession, forgiveness, and deathbed conversions ... In thedomain of eternal justice the offense and the punishment are inseparablyconnected as the same event, because there is no real distinction betweenthe action and its outcome ... It is Karma, or our old acts, that draws usback into earthly life. The spirit's abode changes according to its Karma,and this Karma forbids any long continuance in one condition, because it isalways changing. So long as action is governed by material and selfishmotives, just so long must the effect of that action be manifested inphysical rebirths. Only the perfectly selfless man can elude the gravitationof material life. Few have attained this, but it is the goal of mankind.And then the writer quotes from The Secret Doctrine:Those who believe in Karma have to believe in destiny, which, from birth todeath, every man is weaving, thread by thread, around himself, as a spiderdoes his cobweb, and this destiny is guided either by the heavenly voice ofthe invisible prototype outside of us, or by our more intimate astral orinner man, who is but too often the evil genius of the embodied entitycalled man. Both these lead on the outward man, but one of them mustprevail; and from the very beginning of the invisible affray the stern andimplacable law of compensation steps in and takes its course, faithfullyfollowing the fluctuations. When the last strand is woven, and man isseemingly enwrapped in the network of his own doing, then he finds himselfcompletely under the empire of this self-made destiny ... An Occultist or aphilosopher will not speak of the goodness or cruelty of Providence; but,identifying it with Karma-Nemesis, he will teach that, nevertheless, itguards the good and watches over them in this as in future lives; and thatit punishes the evil-doer-aye, even to his seventh rebirth-so long, inshort, as the effect of his having thrown into perturbation even thesmallest atom in the infinite world of harmony has not been finallyPage 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtreadjusted. For the only decree of Karma-an eternal and immutable decree-isabsolute harmony in the world of matter as it is in the world of spirit. Itis not, therefore, Karma that rewards or punishes, but it is we who rewardor punish ourselves according to whether we work with, through and alongwith nature, abiding by the laws on which that harmony depends, or-breakthem. Nor would the ways of Karma be inscrutable were men to work in unionand harmony, instead of disunion and strife. For our ignorance of thoseways-which one portion of mankind calls the ways of Providence, dark andintricate; while another sees in them the action of blind fatalism; and athird simple chance, with neither gods nor devils to guide them-would surelydisappear if we would but attribute all these to their correct cause ... Westand bewildered before the mystery of our own making and the riddles oflife that we will not solve, and then accuse the great Sphinx of devouringus. But verily there is not an accident of our lives, not a misshapen day,or a misfortune, that could not be traced back to our own doings in this orin another life ... The law of Karma is inextricably interwoven with that ofreincarnation ... It is only this doctrine that can explain to us themysterious problem of good and evil, and reconcile man to the terrible andapparent injustice of life. Nothing but such certainty can quiet ourrevolted sense of justice. For, when one unacquainted with the nobledoctrine looks around him and observes the inequalities of birth andfortune, of intellect and capacities; when one sees honor paid to fools andwastrels, on whom fortune has heaped her favors by mere privilege of birth,and their nearest neighbor, with all his intellect and noble virtues-farmore deserving in every way-perishing for want and for lack of sympathy-whenone sees all this and has to turn away, helpless to relieve the undeservedsuffering, one's ears ringing and heart aching with the cries of pain aroundhim-that blessed knowledge of Karma alone prevents him from cursing life andmen as well as their supposed Creator ... This law, whether conscious orunconscious, predestines nothing and no one. It exists from and in eternitytruly, for it is eternity itself; and as such, since no act can be coequalwith eternity, it cannot be said to act, for it is action itself. It is notthe wave which drowns the man, but the personal action of the wretch whogoes deliberately and places himself under the impersonal action of the lawsthat govern the ocean's motion. Karma creates nothing, nor does it design.It is man who plants and creates causes, and Karmic law adjusts the effects,which adjustment is not an act but universal harmony, tending ever to resumeits original position, like a bough, which, bent down too forcibly, reboundswith corresponding vigor. If it happen to dislocate the arm that tried tobend it out of its natural position, shall we say it is the bough whichbroke our arm or that our own folly has brought us to grief? Karma has neversought to destroy intellectual and individual liberty, like the god inventedby the Monotheists. It has not involved its decrees in darkness purposely toperplex man, nor shall it punish him who dares to scrutinize its mysteries.On the contrary, he who unveils through study and meditation its intricatepaths, and throws light on those dark ways, in the windings of which so manymen perish owing to their ignorance of the labyrinth of life, is working forthe good of his fellowmen. Karma is an absolute and eternal law in the worldof manifestation; and as there can only be one Absolute, as one Eternal,ever-present Cause, believers in Karma cannot be regarded as atheists ormaterialists, still less as fatalists, for Karma is one with the Unknowable,of which it is an aspect, in its effects in the phenomenal world.Another able Theosophic writer says:Every individual is making Karma either good or bad in each action andthought of his daily round, and is at the same time working out in this lifethe Karma brought about by the acts and desires of the last. When we seepeople afflicted by congenital ailments it may be safely assumed that theseailments are the inevitable results of causes started by themselves in aprevious birth. It may be argued that, as these afflictions are hereditary,they can have nothing to do with a past incarnation; but it must beremembered that the Ego, the real man, the individuality, has no spiritualorigin in the parentage by which it is reembodied, but it is drawn by thePage 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtaffinities which its previous mode of life attracted round it into thecurrent that carries it, when the time comes for rebirth, to the home bestfitted for the development of those tendencies ... This doctrine of Karma,when properly understood, is well calculated to guide and assist those whorealize its truth to a higher and better mode of life, for it must not beforgotten that not only our actions but our thoughts also are most assuredlyfollowed by a crowd of circumstances that will influence for good or forevil our own future, and, what is still more important, the future of manyof our fellow-creatures. If sins of omission and commission could in anycase be only self-regarding, the fact on the sinner's Karma would be amatter of minor consequence. The effect that every thought and act throughlife carries with it for good or evil a corresponding influence on othermembers of the human family renders a strict sense of justice, morality, andunselfishness so necessary to future happiness or progress. A crime oncecommitted, an evil thought sent out from the mind, are past recall-no amountof repentance can wipe out their results in the future. Repentance, ifsincere, will deter a man from repeating errors; it cannot save him orothers from the effects of those already produced, which will mostunerringly overtake him either in this life or in the next rebirth.Mr. J.H. Conelly proceeds-The believers in a religion based upon such doctrine are willing it shouldbe compared with one in which man's destiny for eternity is determined bythe accidents of a single, brief earthly existence, during which he ischeered by the promise that \"as the tree falls so shall it lie\"; in whichhis brightest hope, when he wakes up to a knowledge of his wickedness, isthe doctrine of vicarious atonement, and in which even that is handicapped,according to the Presbyterian Confession of Faith.By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men andangels are predestinated unto everlasting life and others foreordained toeverlasting death.These angels and men thus predestinated and foreordained are particularlyand unchangeably designed; and their number is so certain and definite thatit cannot be either increased or diminished ... As God hath appointed theelect unto glory ... Neither are any other redeemed by Christ effectuallycalled, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.The rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counselof his own will, whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth,for the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by and toordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin to the praise of hisglorious justice.This is what the able defender says. Nor can we do any better than wind upthe subject as he does, by a quotation from a magnificent poem. As he says:The exquisite beauty of Edwin Arnold's exposition of Karma in The Light ofAsia tempts to its reproduction here, but it is too long for quotation infull. Here is a portion of it:  Karma-all that total of a soul Which is the things it did, the thoughts it had, The \"self\" it wove with woof of viewless time Crossed on the warp invisible of acts.  * * * * * Before beginning and without an end,Page 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txt As space eternal and as surety sure, Is fixed a Power divine which moves to good,  Only its laws endure. It will not be despised of anyone; Who thwarts it loses, and who serves it gains; The hidden good it pays with peace and bliss,  The hidden ill with pains. It seeth everywhere and marketh all; Do right-it recompenseth! Do one wrong- The equal retribution must be made,  Though Dharma tarry long. It knows not wrath nor pardon; utter-true, Its measures mete, its faultless balance weighs; Times are as naught, tomorrow it will judge  Or after many days.  * * * * * Such is the law which moves to righteousness, Which none at last can turn aside or stay; The heart of it is love, the end of itIs peace and consummation sweet. Obey.And now I advise you to compare our Theosophic views upon Karma, the law ofRetribution, and say whether they are not both more philosophical and justthan this cruel and idiotic dogma which makes of \"God\" a senseless fiend;the tenet, namely, that the \"elect only\" will be saved, and the rest doomedto eternal perdition!Q. Yes, I see what you mean generally; but I wish you could give someconcrete example of the action of Karma?A. That I cannot do. We can only feel sure, as I said before, that ourpresent lives and circumstances are the direct results of our own deeds andthoughts in lives that are past. But we, who are not Seers or Initiates,cannot know anything about the details of the working of the law of Karma.Q. Can anyone, even an Adept or Seer, follow out this Karmic process ofreadjustment in detail?A. Certainly: \"Those who know\" can do so by the exercise of powers which arelatent even in all men.  -oOo-Who Are Those Who Know?Page 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. Does this hold equally of ourselves as of others?A. Equally. Aa just said, the same limited vision exists for all, save thosewho have reached in the present incarnation the acme of spiritual vision andclairvoyance. We can only perceive that, if things with us ought to havebeen different, they would have been different; that we are what we havemade ourselves, and have only what we have earned for ourselves.Q. I am afraid such a conception would only embitter us.A. I believe it is precisely the reverse. It is disbelief in the just law ofretribution that is more likely to awaken every combative feeling in man. Achild, as much as a man, resents a punishment, or even a reproof he believesto be unmerited, far more than he does a more severe punishment, if he feelsthat it is merited. Belief in Karma is the highest reason for reconcilementto one's lot in this life, and the very strongest incentive towards effortto better the succeeding rebirth. Both of these, indeed, would be destroyedif we supposed that our lot was the result of anything but strict Law, orthat destiny was in any other hands than our own.Q. You have just asserted that this system of Reincarnation under Karmic lawcommended itself to reason, justice, and the moral sense. But, if so, is itnot at some sacrifice of the gentler qualities of sympathy and pity, andthus a hardening of the finer instincts of human nature?A. Only apparently, not really. No man can receive more or less than hisdeserts without a corresponding injustice or partiality to others; and a lawwhich could be averted through compassion would bring about more misery thanit saved, more irritation and curses than thanks. Remember also, that we donot administer the law, if we do create causes for its effects; itadministers itself; and again, that the most copious provision for themanifestation of just compassion and mercy is shown in the state ofDevachan.Q. You speak of Adepts as being an exception to the rule of our generalignorance. Do they really know more than we do of Reincarnation and afterstates?A. They do, indeed. By the training of faculties we all possess, but whichthey alone have developed to perfection, they have entered in spirit thesevarious planes and states we have been discussing. For long ages, onegeneration of Adepts after another has studied the mysteries of being, oflife, death, and rebirth, and all have taught in their turn some of thefacts so learned.Q. And is the production of Adepts the aim of Theosophy?A. Theosophy considers humanity as an emanation from divinity on its returnpath thereto. At an advanced point upon the path, Adeptship is reached bythose who have devoted several incarnations to its achievement. For,remember well, no man has ever reached Adeptship in the Secret Sciences inone life; but many incarnations are necessary for it after the formation ofa conscious purpose and the beginning of the needful training. Many may bethe men and women in the very midst of our Society who have begun thisuphill work toward illumination several incarnations ago, and who yet, owingto the personal illusions of the present life, are either ignorant of thefact, or on the road to losing every chance in this existence of progressingany farther. They feel an irresistible attraction toward occultism and theHigher Life, and yet are too personal and self-opinionated, too much in lovewith the deceptive allurements of mundane life and the world's ephemeralpleasures, to give them up; and so lose their chance in their present birth.But, for ordinary men, for the practical duties of daily life, such afar-off result is inappropriate as an aim and quite ineffective as a motive.Page 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. What, then, may be their object or distinct purpose in joining theTheosophical Society?A. Many are interested in our doctrines and feel instinctively that they aretruer than those of any dogmatic religion. Others have formed a fixedresolve to attain the highest ideal of man's duty.  -oOo-The Difference Between Faith and Knowledge, Or Blind and Reasoned FaithQ. You say that they accept and believe in the doctrines of Theosophy. But,as they do not belong to those Adepts you have just mentioned, then theymust accept your teachings on blind faith. In what does this differ fromthat of conventional religions?A. As it differs on almost all the other points, so it differs on this one.What you call \"faith,\" and that which is blind faith, in reality, and withregard to the dogmas of the Christian religions, becomes with us\"knowledge,\" the logical sequence of things we know, about facts in nature.Your Doctrines are based upon interpretation, therefore, upon the secondhandtestimony of Seers; ours upon the invariable and unvarying testimony ofSeers. The ordinary Christian theology, for instance, holds that man is acreature of God, of three component parts-body, soul, and spirit-allessential to his integrity, and all, either in the gross form of physicalearthly existence or in the etherealized form of post-resurrectionexperience, needed to so constitute him forever, each man having thus apermanent existence separate from other men, and from the Divine. Theosophy,on the other hand, holds that man, being an emanation from the Unknown, yetever present and infinite Divine Essence, his body and everything else isimpermanent, hence an illusion; Spirit alone in him being the one enduringsubstance, and even that losing its separated individuality at the moment ofits complete reunion with the Universal Spirit.Q. If we lose even our individuality, then it becomes simply annihilation.A. I say it does not, since I speak of separate, not of universalindividuality. The latter becomes as a part transformed into the whole; thedewdrop is not evaporated, but becomes the sea. Is physical man annihilated,when from a fetus he becomes an old man? What kind of Satanic pride must beours if we place our infinitesimally small consciousness and individualityhigher than the universal and infinite consciousness!Q. It follows, then, that there is, de facto, no man, but all is Spirit?A. You are mistaken. It thus follows that the union of Spirit with matter isbut temporary; or, to put it more clearly, since Spirit and matter are one,being the two opposite poles of the universal manifested substance-thatSpirit loses its right to the name so long as the smallest particle and atomof its manifesting substance still clings to any form, the result ofdifferentiation. To believe otherwise is blind faith.Q. Thus it is on knowledge, not on faith, that you assert that the permanentprinciple, the Spirit, simply makes a transit through matter?A. I would put it otherwise and say-we assert that the appearance of thepermanent and one principle, Spirit, as matter is transient, and, therefore,no better than an illusion.Q. Very well; and this, given out on knowledge not faith?A. Just so. But as I see very well what you are driving at, I may just aswell tell you that we hold faith, such as you advocate, to be a mentalPage 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtdisease, and real faith, i.e., the pistis of the Greeks, as \"belief based onknowledge,\" whether supplied by the evidence of physical or spiritualsenses.Q. What do you mean?A. I mean, if it is the difference between the two that you want to know,then I can tell you that between faith on authority and faith on one'sspiritual intuition, there is a very great difference.Q. What is it?A. One is human credulity and superstition, the other human belief andintuition. As Professor Alexander Wilder says in his \"Introduction to theEleusinian Mysteries,\"It is ignorance which leads to profanation. Men ridicule what they do notproperly understand ... The undercurrent of this world is set towards onegoal; and inside of human credulity ... is a power almost infinite, a holyfaith capable of apprehending the most supreme truths of all existence.Those who limit that \"credulity\" to human authoritative dogmas alone, willnever fathom that power nor even perceive it in their natures. It is stuckfast to the external plane and is unable to bring forth into play theessence that rules it; for to do this they have to claim their right ofprivate judgment, and this they never dare to do.Q. And is it that \"intuition\" which forces you to reject God as a personalFather, Ruler, and Governor of the Universe?A. Precisely. We believe in an ever unknowable Principle, because blindaberration alone can make one maintain that the Universe, thinking man, andall the marvels contained even in the world of matter, could have grownwithout some intelligent powers to bring about the extraordinarily wisearrangement of all its parts. Nature may err, and often does, in its detailsand the external manifestations of its materials, never in its inner causesand results. Ancient pagans held on this question far more philosophicalviews than modern philosophers, whether Agnostics, Materialists, orChristians; and no pagan writer has ever yet advanced the proposition thatcruelty and mercy are not finite feelings, and can therefore be made theattributes of an infinite god. Their gods, therefore, were all finite. TheSiamese author of the Wheel of the Law, expresses the same idea about yourpersonal god as we do; he says:A Buddhist might believe in the existence of a god, sublime above all humanqualities and attributes-a perfect god, above love, and hatred, andjealousy, calmly resting in a quietude that nothing could disturb, and ofsuch a god he would speak no disparagement not from a desire to please himor fear to offend him, but from natural veneration; but he cannot understanda god with the attributes and qualities of men, a god who loves and hates,and shows anger; a Deity who, whether described as by Christian Missionariesor by Mohammedans or Brahmins, or Jews, falls below his standard of even anordinary good man.Q. Faith for faith, is not the faith of the Christian who believes, in hishuman helplessness and humility, that there is a merciful Father in Heavenwho will protect him from temptation, help him in life, and forgive him histransgressions, better than the cold and proud, almost fatalistic faith ofthe Buddhists, Vedantins, and Theosophists?A. Persist in calling our belief \"faith\" if you will. But once we are againon this ever-recurring question, I ask in my turn: faith for faith, is notthe one based on strict logic and reason better than the one which is basedsimply on human authority or-hero-worship? Our \"faith\" has all the logicalPage 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtforce of the arithmetical truism that two and two will produce four. Yourfaith is like the logic of some emotional women, of whom Tourgenyeff saidthat for them two and two were generally five, and a tallow candle into thebargain. Yours is a faith, moreover, which clashes not only with everyconceivable view of justice and logic, but which, if analyzed, leads man tohis moral perdition, checks the progress of mankind, and positively makingof might, right-transforms every second man into a Cain to his brother Abel.Q. What do you allude to?  -oOo-Has God the Right to Forgive?A. To the Doctrine of Atonement; I allude to that dangerous dogma in whichyou believe, and which teaches us that no matter how enormous our crimesagainst the laws of God and of man, we have but to believe in theself-sacrifice of Jesus for the salvation of mankind, and his blood willwash out every stain. It is twenty years that I preach against it, and I maynow draw your attention to a paragraph from Isis Unveiled, written in 1875.This is what Christianity teaches, and what we combat:God's mercy is boundless and unfathomable. It is impossible to conceive of ahuman sin so damnable that the price paid in advance for the redemption ofthe sinner would not wipe it out if a thousandfold worse. And furthermore,it is never too late to repent. Though the offender wait until the lastminute of the last hour of the last day of his mortal life, before hisblanched lips utter the confession of faith, he may go to Paradise; thedying thief did it, and so may all others as vile. These are the assumptionsof the Church, and of the Clergy; assumptions banged at the heads of yourcountrymen by England's favorite preachers, right in the \"light of thenineteenth century,\" ...-this most paradoxical age of all. Now to what does it lead?Q. Does it not make the Christian happier than the Buddhist or Brahmin?A. No; not the educated man, at any rate, since the majority of these havelong since virtually lost all belief in this cruel dogma. But it leads thosewho still believe in it more easily to the threshold of every conceivablecrime, than any other I know of. Let me quote to you once more:If we step outside the little circle of creed and consider the universe as awhole balanced by the exquisite adjustment of parts, how all sound logic,how the faintest glimmering sense of Justice, revolts against this VicariousAtonement! If the criminal sinned only against himself, and wronged no onebut himself; if by sincere repentance he could cause the obliteration ofpast events, not only from the memory of man, but also from thatimperishable record, which no deity-not even the most Supreme of theSupreme-can cause to disappear, then this dogma might not beincomprehensible. But to maintain that one may wrong his fellowman, kill,disturb the equilibrium of society and the natural order of things, andthen-through cowardice, hope, or compulsion, it matters not-be forgiven bybelieving that the spilling of one blood washes out the other bloodspilt-this is preposterous! Can the results of a crime be obliterated eventhough the crime itself should be pardoned? The effects of a cause are neverlimited to the boundaries of the cause, nor can the results of crime beconfined to the offender and his victim. Every good as well as evil actionhas its effects, as palpably as the stone flung into calm water. The simileis trite, but it is the best ever conceived, so let us use it. The eddyingcircles are greater and swifter as the disturbing object is greater orsmaller, but the smallest pebble, nay, the tiniest speck, makes its ripples.And this disturbance is not alone visible and on the surface. Below, unseen,in every direction-outward and downward-drop pushes drop until the sides andPage 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtbottom are touched by the force. More, the air above the water is agitated,and this disturbance passes, as the physicists tell us, from stratum tostratum out into space forever and ever; an impulse has been given tomatter, and that is never lost, can never be recalled! ...So with crime, and so with its opposite. The action may be instantaneous,the effects are eternal. When, after the stone is once flung into the pond,we can recall it to the hand, roll back the ripples, obliterate the forceexpended, restore the etheric waves to their previous state of non-being,and wipe out every trace of the act of throwing the missile, so that Time'srecord shall not show that it ever happened, then, then we may patientlyhear Christians argue for the efficacy of this Atonement,-and cease to believe in Karmic Law. As it now stands, we call upon thewhole world to decide, which of our two doctrines is the most appreciativeof deific justice, and which is more reasonable, even on simple humanevidence and logic.Q. Yet millions believe in the Christian dogma and are happy.A. Pure sentimentalism overpowering their thinking faculties, which no truephilanthropist or Altruist will ever accept. It is not even a dream ofselfishness, but a nightmare of the human intellect. Look where it leads to,and tell me the name of that pagan country where crimes are more easilycommitted or more numerous than in Christian lands. Look at the long andghastly annual records of crimes committed in European countries; and beholdProtestant and Biblical America. There, conversions effected in prisons aremore numerous than those made by public revivals and preaching. See how theledger-balance of Christian justice (!) stands: Red-handed murderers, urgedon by the demons of lust, revenge, cupidity, fanaticism, or mere brutalthirst for blood, who kill their victims, in most cases, without giving themtime to repent or call on Jesus. These, perhaps, died sinful, and, ofcourse-consistently with theological logic-met the reward of their greateror lesser of fences. But the murderer, overtaken by human justice, isimprisoned, wept over by sentimentalists, prayed with and at, pronounces thecharmed words of conversion, and goes to the scaffold a redeemed child ofJesus! Except for the murder, he would not have been prayed with, redeemed,pardoned. Clearly this man did well to murder, for thus he gained eternalhappiness! And how about the victim, and his, or her family, relatives,dependents, social relations; has justice no recompense for them? Must theysuffer in this world and the next, while he who wronged them sits beside the\"holy thief\" of Calvary, and is forever blessed? On this question the clergykeep a prudent silence. (Isis Unveiled) And now you know whyTheosophists-whose fundamental belief and hope is justice for all, in Heavenas on earth, and in Karma-reject this dogma.Q. The ultimate destiny of man, then, is not a Heaven presided over by God,but the gradual transformation of matter into its primordial element,Spirit?A. It is to that final goal to which all tends in nature.Q. Do not some of you regard this association or \"fall of spirit intomatter\" as evil, and rebirth as a sorrow?A. Some do, and therefore strive to shorten their period of probation onearth. It is not an unmixed evil, however, since it ensures the experienceupon which we mount to knowledge and wisdom. I mean that experience whichteaches that the needs of our spiritual nature can never be met by otherthan spiritual happiness. As long as we are in the body, we are subjected topain, suffering and all the disappointing incidents occurring during life.Therefore, and to palliate this, we finally acquire knowledge which alonecan afford us relief and hope of a better future.Page 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtWhat is Practical Theosophy?  DutyQ. Why, then, the need for rebirths, since all alike fail to secure apermanent peace?A. Because the final goal cannot be reached in any way but through lifeexperiences, and because the bulk of these consist in pain and suffering. Itis only through the latter that we can learn. Joys and pleasures teach usnothing; they are evanescent, and can only bring in the long run satiety.Moreover, our constant failure to find any permanent satisfaction in lifewhich would meet the wants of our higher nature, shows us plainly that thosewants can be met only on their own plane, to wit-the spiritual.Q. Is the natural result of this a desire to quit life by one means oranother?A. If you mean by such desire \"suicide,\" then I say, most decidedly not.Such a result can never be a \"natural\" one, but is ever due to a morbidbrain disease, or to most decided and strong materialistic views. It is theworst of crimes and dire in its results. But if by desire, you mean simplyaspiration to reach spiritual existence, not a wish to quit the earth, thenI would call it a very natural desire indeed. Otherwise voluntary deathwould be an abandonment of our present post and of the duties incumbent onus, as well as an attempt to shirk Karmic responsibilities, and thus involvethe creation of new Karma.Q. But if actions on the material plane are unsatisfying, why should duties,which are such actions, be imperative?A. First of all, because our philosophy teaches us that the object of doingour duties to all men and to ourselves the last, is not the attainment ofpersonal happiness, but of the happiness of others; the fulfillment of rightfor the sake of right, not for what it may bring us. Happiness, or rathercontentment, may indeed follow the performance of duty, but is not and mustnot be the motive for it.Q. What do you understand precisely by \"duty\" in Theosophy? It cannot be theChristian duties preached by Jesus and his Apostles, since you recognizeneither?A. You are once more mistaken. What you call \"Christian duties\" wereinculcated by every great moral and religious Reformer ages before theChristian era. All that was great, generous, heroic, was, in days of old,not only talked about and preached from pulpits as in our own time, butacted upon sometimes by whole nations. The history of the Buddhist reform isfull of the most noble and most heroically unselfish acts.Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love as brethren,be pitiful, be courteous; not rendering evil for evil, or railing forrailing; but contrariwise, blessing ...-was practically carried out by the followers of Buddha, several centuriesbefore Peter. The Ethics of Christianity are grand, no doubt; but asundeniably they are not new, and have originated as \"Pagan\" duties.Q. And how would you define these duties, or \"duty,\" in general, as youunderstand the term?A. Duty is that which is due to Humanity, to our fellowmen, neighbors,family, and especially that which we owe to all those who are poorer andmore helpless than we are ourselves. This is a debt which, if left unpaidduring life, leaves us spiritually insolvent and morally bankrupt in ourPage 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtnext incarnation. Theosophy is the quintessence of duty.Q. So is Christianity when rightly understood and carried out.A. No doubt it is; but then, were it not a lip-religion in practice,Theosophy would have little to do amidst Christians. Unfortunately it is butsuch lip-ethics. Those who practice their duty towards all, and for duty'sown sake, are few; and fewer still are those who perform that duty,remaining content with the satisfaction of their own secret consciousness.It is-... the public voiceOf praise that honors virtue and rewards it,-which is ever uppermost in the minds of the \"world renowned\"philanthropists. Modern ethics are beautiful to read about and heardiscussed; but what are words unless converted into actions? Finally: if youask me how we understand Theosophical duty practically and in view of Karma,I may answer you that our duty is to drink without a murmur to the lastdrop, whatever contents the cup of life may have in store for us, to pluckthe roses of life only for the fragrance they may shed on others, and to beourselves content but with the thorns, if that fragrance cannot be enjoyedwithout depriving someone else of it.Q. All this is very vague. What do you do more than Christians do?A. It is not what we members of the Theosophical Society do-though some ofus try our best-but how much farther Theosophy leads to good than modernChristianity does. I say-action, enforced action, instead of mere intentionand talk. A man may be what he likes, the most worldly, selfish andhard-hearted of men, even a deep-dyed rascal, and it will not prevent himfrom calling himself a Christian, or others from so regarding him. But noTheosophist has the right to this name, unless he is thoroughly imbued withthe correctness of Carlyle's truism: \"The end of man is an action and not athought, though it were the noblest\"-and unless he sets and models his dailylife upon this truth. The profession of a truth is not yet the enactment ofit; and the more beautiful and grand it sounds, the more loudly virtue orduty is talked about instead of being acted upon, the more forcibly it willalways remind one of the Dead Sea fruit. Cant is the most loathsome of allvices; and cant is the most prominent feature of the greatest Protestantcountry of this century-England.Q. What do you consider as due to humanity at large?A. Full recognition of equal rights and privileges for all, and withoutdistinction of race, color, social position, or birth.Q. When would you consider such due not given?A. When there is the slightest invasion of another's right-be that other aman or a nation; when there is any failure to show him the same justice,kindness, consideration, or mercy which we desire for ourselves. The wholepresent system of politics is built on the oblivion of such rights, and themost fierce assertion of national selfishness. The French say: \"Like master,like man.\" They ought to add, \"Like national policy, like citizen.\"Q. Do you take any part in politics?A. As a Society, we carefully avoid them, for the reasons given below. Toseek to achieve political reforms before we have effected a reform in humannature, is like putting new wine into old bottles. Make men feel andrecognize in their innermost hearts what is their real, true duty to allmen, and every old abuse of power, every iniquitous law in the nationalPage 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtpolicy, based on human, social, or political selfishness, will disappear ofitself. Foolish is the gardener who seeks to weed his flowerbed of poisonousplants by cutting them off from the surface of the soil, instead of tearingthem out by the roots. No lasting political reform can be ever achieved withthe same selfish men at the head of affairs as of old.  -oOo-The Relations of the T.S. to Political ReformsQ. The Theosophical Society is not, then, a political organization?A. Certainly not. It is international in the highest sense in that itsmembers comprise men and women of all races, creeds, and forms of thought,who work together for one object, the improvement of humanity; but as asociety it takes absolutely no part in any national or party politics.Q. Why is this?A. Just for the reasons I have mentioned. Moreover, political action mustnecessarily vary with the circumstances of the time and with theidiosyncrasies of individuals. While from the very nature of their positionas Theosophists the members of the T.S. are agreed on the principles ofTheosophy, or they would not belong to the society at all, it does notthereby follow that they agree on every other subject. As a society they canonly act together in matters which are common to all-that is, in Theosophyitself; as individuals, each is left perfectly free to follow out his or herparticular line of political thought and action, so long as this does notconflict with Theosophical principles or hurt the Theosophical Society.Q. But surely the T.S. does not stand altogether aloof from the socialquestions which are now so fast coming to the front?A. The very principles of the T.S. are a proof that it does not-or, rather,that most of its members do not-so stand aloof. If humanity can only bedeveloped mentally and spiritually by the enforcement, first of all, of thesoundest and most scientific physiological laws, it is the bounden duty ofall who strive for this development to do their utmost to see that thoselaws shall be generally carried out. All Theosophists are only too sadlyaware that, in Occidental countries especially, the social condition oflarge masses of the people renders it impossible for either their bodies ortheir spirits to be properly trained, so that the development of both isthereby arrested. As this training and development is one of the expressobjects of Theosophy, the T.S. is in thorough sympathy and harmony with alltrue efforts in this direction.Q. But what do you mean by \"true efforts\"? Each social reformer has his ownpanacea, and each believes his to be the one and only thing which canimprove and save humanity?A. Perfectly true, and this is the real reason why so little satisfactorysocial work is accomplished. In most of these panaceas there is no reallyguiding principle, and there is certainly no one principle which connectsthem all. Valuable time and energy are thus wasted; for men, instead ofcooperating, strive one against the other, often, it is to be feared, forthe sake of fame and reward rather than for the great cause which theyprofess to have at heart, and which should be supreme in their lives.Q. How, then, should Theosophical principles be applied so that socialcooperation may be promoted and true efforts for social amelioration becarried on?A. Let me briefly remind you what these principles are-universal Unity andCausation; Human Solidarity; the Law of Karma; Reincarnation. These are thePage 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtfour links of the golden chain which should bind humanity into one family,one universal Brotherhood.Q. How?A. In the present state of society, especially in so-called civilizedcountries, we are continually brought face to face with the fact that largenumbers of people are suffering from misery, poverty, and disease. Theirphysical condition is wretched, and their mental and spiritual faculties areoften almost dormant. On the other hand, many persons at the opposite end ofthe social scale are leading lives of careless indifference, materialluxury, and selfish indulgence. Neither of these forms of existence is merechance. Both are the effects of the conditions which surround those who aresubject to them, and the neglect of social duty on the one side is mostclosely connected with the stunted and arrested development on the other. Insociology, as in all branches of true science, the law of universalcausation holds good. But this causation necessarily implies, as its logicaloutcome, that human solidarity on which Theosophy so strongly insists. Ifthe action of one reacts on the lives of all, and this is the truescientific idea, then it is only by all men becoming brothers and all womensisters, and by all practicing in their daily lives true brotherhood andtrue sisterhood, that the real human solidarity, which lies at the root ofthe elevation of the race, can ever be attained. It is this action andinteraction, this true brotherhood and sisterhood, in which each shall livefor all and all for each, which is one of the fundamental Theosophicalprinciples that every Theosophist should be bound, not only to teach, but tocarry out in his or her individual life.Q. All this is very well as a general principle, but how would you apply itin a concrete way?A. Look for a moment at what you would call the concrete facts of humansociety. Contrast the lives not only of the masses of the people, but ofmany of those who are called the middle and upper classes, with what theymight be under healthier and nobler conditions, where justice, kindness, andlove were paramount, instead of the selfishness, indifference, and brutalitywhich now too often seem to reign supreme. All good and evil things inhumanity have their roots in human character, and this character is, and hasbeen, conditioned by the endless chain of cause and effect. But thisconditioning applies to the future as well as to the present and the past.Selfishness, indifference, and brutality can never be the normal state ofthe race-to believe so would be to despair of humanity-and that noTheosophist can do. Progress can be attained, and only attained, by thedevelopment of the nobler qualities. Now, true evolution teaches us that byaltering the surroundings of the organism we can alter and improve theorganism; and in the strictest sense this is true with regard to man. EveryTheosophist, therefore, is bound to do his utmost to help on, by all themeans in his power, every wise and well-considered social effort which hasfor its object the amelioration of the condition of the poor. Such effortsshould be made with a view to their ultimate social emancipation, or thedevelopment of the sense of duty in those who now so often neglect it innearly every relation of life.Q. Agreed. But who is to decide whether social efforts are wise or unwise?A. No one person and no society can lay down a hard-and-fast rule in thisrespect. Much must necessarily be left to the individual judgment. Onegeneral test may, however, be given. Will the proposed action tend topromote that true brotherhood which it is the aim of Theosophy to bringabout? No real Theosophist will have much difficulty in applying such atest; once he is satisfied of this, his duty will lie in the direction offorming public opinion. And this can be attained only by inculcating thosehigher and nobler conceptions of public and private duties which lie at theroot of all spiritual and material improvement. In every conceivable case hePage 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txthimself must be a center of spiritual action, and from him and his own dailyindividual life must radiate those higher spiritual forces which alone canregenerate his fellowmen.Q. But why should he do this? Are not he and all, as you teach, conditionedby their Karma, and must not Karma necessarily work itself out on certainlines?A. It is this very law of Karma which gives strength to all that I havesaid. The individual cannot separate himself from the race, nor the racefrom the individual. The law of Karma applies equally to all, although allare not equally developed. In helping on the development of others, theTheosophist believes that he is not only helping them to fulfill theirKarma, but that he is also, in the strictest sense, fulfilling his own. Itis the development of humanity, of which both he and they are integralparts, that he has always in view, and he knows that any failure on his partto respond to the highest within him retards not only himself but all, intheir progressive march. By his actions, he can make it either moredifficult or more easy for humanity to attain the next higher plane ofbeing.Q. How does this bear on the fourth of the principles you mentioned, viz.,Reincarnation?A. The connection is most intimate. If our present lives depend upon thedevelopment of certain principles which are a growth from the germs left bya previous existence, the law holds good as regards the future. Once graspthe idea that universal causation is not merely present, but past, present,and future, and every action on our present plane falls naturally and easilyinto its true place, and is seen in its true relation to ourselves and toothers. Every mean and selfish action sends us backward and not forward,while every noble thought and every unselfish deed are stepping-stones tothe higher and more glorious planes of being. If this life were all, then inmany respects it would indeed be poor and mean; but regarded as apreparation for the next sphere of existence, it may be used as the goldengate through which we may pass, not selfishly and alone, but in company withour fellows, to the palaces which lie beyond.  -oOo-On Self-SacrificeQ. Is equal justice to all and love to every creature the highest standardof Theosophy?A. No; there is an even far higher one.Q. What can it be?A. The giving to others more than to oneself-self-sacrifice. Such was thestandard and abounding measure which marked so preeminently the greatestTeachers and Masters of Humanity-e.g., Gautama Buddha in History, and Jesusof Nazareth as in the Gospels. This trait alone was enough to secure to themthe perpetual reverence and gratitude of the generations of men that comeafter them. We say, however, that self-sacrifice has to be performed withdiscrimination; and such a self-abandonment, if made without justice, orblindly, regardless of subsequent results, may often prove not only made invain, but harmful. One of the fundamental rules of Theosophy is, justice tooneself-viewed as a unit of collective humanity, not as a personalself-justice, not more but not less than to others; unless, indeed, by thesacrifice of the one self we can benefit the many.Q. Could you make your idea clearer by giving an instance?Page 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. There are many instances to illustrate it in history. Self-sacrifice forpractical good to save many, or several people, Theosophy holds as farhigher than self-abnegation for a sectarian idea, such as that of \"savingthe heathen from damnation,\" for instance. In our opinion, Father Damien,the young man of thirty who offered his whole life in sacrifice for thebenefit and alleviation of the sufferings of the lepers at Molokai, and whowent to live for eighteen years alone with them, to finally catch theloathsome disease and die, has not died in vain. He has given relief andrelative happiness to thousands of miserable wretches. He has brought tothem consolation, mental and physical. He threw a streak of light into theblack and dreary night of an existence, the hopelessness of which isunparalleled in the records of human suffering. He was a true Theosophist,and his memory will live forever in our annals. In our sight this poorBelgian priest stands immeasurably higher than-for instance-all thosesincere but vain-glorious fools, the Missionaries who have sacrificed theirlives in the South Sea Islands or China. What good have they done? They wentin one case to those who are not yet ripe for any truth; and in the other toa nation whose systems of religious philosophy are as grand as any, if onlythe men who have them would live up to the standard of Confucius and theirother sages. And they died victims of irresponsible cannibals and savages,and of popular fanaticism and hatred. Whereas, by going to the slums ofWhitechapel or some other such locality of those that stagnate right underthe blazing sun of our civilization, full of Christian savages and mentalleprosy, they might have done real good, and preserved their lives for abetter and worthier cause.Q. But the Christians do not think so?A. Of course not, because they act on an erroneous belief. They think thatby baptizing the body of an irresponsible savage they save his soul fromdamnation. One church forgets her martyrs, the other beatifies and raisesstatues to such men as Labro, who sacrificed his body for forty years onlyto benefit the vermin which it bred. Had we the means to do so, we wouldraise a statue to Father Damien, the true, practical saint, and perpetuatehis memory forever as a living exemplar of Theosophical heroism and ofBuddha- and Christ-like mercy and self-sacrifice.Q. Then you regard self-sacrifice as a duty?A. We do; and explain it by showing that altruism is an integral part ofself-development. But we have to discriminate. A man has no right to starvehimself to death that another man may have food, unless the life of that manis obviously more useful to the many than is his own life. But it is hisduty to sacrifice his own comfort, and to work for others if they are unableto work for themselves. It is his duty to give all that which is wholly hisown and can benefit no one but himself if he selfishly keeps it from others.Theosophy teaches self-abnegation, but does not teach rash and uselessself-sacrifice, nor does it justify fanaticism.Q. But how are we to reach such an elevated status?A. By the enlightened application of our precepts to practice. By the use ofour higher reason, spiritual intuition, and moral sense, and by followingthe dictates of what we call \"the still small voice\" of our conscience,which is that of our Ego, and which speaks louder in us than the earthquakesand the thunders of Jehovah, wherein \"the Lord is not.\"Q. If such are our duties to humanity at large, what do you understand byour duties to our immediate surroundings?A. Just the same, plus those that arise from special obligations with regardto family ties.Q. Then it is not true, as it is said, that no sooner does a man enter intoPage 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtthe Theosophical Society than he begins to be gradually severed from hiswife, children, and family duties?A. It is a groundless slander, like so many others. The first of theTheosophical duties is to do one's duty by all men, and especially by thoseto whom one's specific responsibilities are due, because one has eithervoluntarily undertaken them, such as marriage ties, or because one's destinyhas allied one to them; I mean those we owe to parents or next of kin.Q. And what may be the duty of a Theosophist to himself?A. To control and conquer, through the Higher, the lower self. To purifyhimself inwardly and morally; to fear no one, and nought, save the tribunalof his own conscience. Never to do a thing by halves; i.e., if he thinks itthe right thing to do, let him do it openly and boldly, and if wrong, nevertouch it at all. It is the duty of a Theosophist to lighten his burden bythinking of the wise aphorism of Epictetus, who says:Be not diverted from your duty by any idle reflection the silly world maymake upon you, for their censures are not in your power, and consequentlyshould not be any part of your concern.Q. But suppose a member of your Society should plead inability to practicealtruism by other people, on the ground that \"charity begins at home,\"urging that he is too busy, or too poor, to benefit mankind or even any ofits units-what are your rules in such a case?A. No man has a right to say that he can do nothing for others, on anypretext whatever. \"By doing the proper duty in the proper place, a man maymake the world his debtor,\" says an English writer. A cup of cold watergiven in time to a thirsty wayfarer is a nobler duty and more worth, than adozen of dinners given away, out of season, to men who can afford to pay forthem. No man who has not got it in him will ever become a Theosophist; buthe may remain a member of our Society all the same. We have no rules bywhich we could force any man to become a practical Theosophist, if he doesnot desire to be one.Q. Then why does he enter the Society at all?A. That is best known to him who does so. For, here again, we have no rightto prejudge a person, not even if the voice of a whole community should beagainst him, and I may tell you why. In our day, vox populi (so far asregards the voice of the educated, at any rate) is no longer vox dei, butever that of prejudice, of selfish motives, and often simply that ofunpopularity. Our duty is to sow seeds broadcast for the future, and seethey are good; not to stop to enquire why we should do so, and how andwherefore we are obliged to lose our time, since those who will reap theharvest in days to come will never be ourselves.  -oOo-On CharityQ. How do you Theosophists regard the Christian duty of charity?A. What charity do you mean? Charity of mind, or practical charity in thephysical plane?Q. I mean practical charity, as your idea of Universal brotherhood wouldinclude, of course, charity of mind.A. Then you have in your mind the practical carrying out of the commandmentsgiven by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount?Page 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. Precisely so.A. Then why call them \"Christian\"? Because, although your Savior preachedand practiced them, the last thing the Christians of today think of is tocarry them out in their lives.Q. And yet many are those who pass their lives in dispensing charity?A. Yes, out of the surplus of their great fortunes. But point out to me thatChristian, among the most philanthropic, who would give to the shivering andstarving thief, who would steal his coat, his cloak also; or offer his rightcheek to him who smote him on the left, and never think of resenting it?Q. Ah, but you must remember that these precepts have not to be takenliterally. Times and circumstances have changed since Christ's day.Moreover, He spoke in Parables.A. Then why don't your Churches teach that the doctrine of damnation andhellfire is to be understood as a parable too? Why do some of your mostpopular preachers, while virtually allowing these \"parables\" to beunderstood as you take them, insist on the literal meaning of the fires ofHell and the physical tortures of an \"Asbestos-like\" soul? If one is a\"parable,\" then the other is. If Hellfire is a literal truth, then Christ'scommandments in the Sermon on the Mount have to be obeyed to the veryletter. And I tell you that many who do not believe in the Divinity ofChrist-like Count Leo Tolstoi and more than one Theosophist-do carry outthese noble, because universal, precepts literally; and many more good menand women would do so, were they not more than certain that such a walk inlife would very probably land them in a lunatic asylum-so Christian are yourlaws!Q. But surely everyone knows that millions and millions are spent annuallyon private and public charities?A. Oh, yes; half of which sticks to the hands it passes through beforegetting to the needy; while a good portion or remainder gets into the handsof professional beggars, those who are too lazy to work, thus doing no goodwhatever to those who are really in misery and suffering. Haven't you heardthat the first result of the great outflow of charity towards the East-endof London was to raise the rents in Whitechapel by some twenty percent?Q. What would you do, then?A. Act individually and not collectively; follow the Northern Buddhistprecepts:Never put food into the mouth of the hungry by the hand of another.Never let the shadow of thy neighbor (a third person) come between thyselfand the object of thy bounty.Never give to the Sun time to dry a tear before thou hast wiped it.AgainNever give money to the needy, or food to the priest, who begs at thy door,through thy servants, lest thy money should diminish gratitude, and thy foodturn to gall.Q. But how can this be applied practically?A. The Theosophical ideas of charity mean personal exertion for others;personal mercy and kindness; personal interest in the welfare of those whosuffer; personal sympathy, forethought and assistance in their troubles orPage 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtneeds. It is important to note that we Theosophists do not believe in givingmoney, if we had it, through other people's hands or organizations. Webelieve in giving to the money a thousandfold greater power andeffectiveness by our personal contact and sympathy with those who need it.We believe in relieving the starvation of the soul, as much if not more thanthe emptiness of the stomach; for gratitude does more good to the man whofeels it, than to him for whom it is felt. Where's the gratitude which your\"millions of pounds\" should have called forth, or the good feelings provokedby them? Is it shown in the hatred of the East-End poor for the rich? In thegrowth of the party of anarchy and disorder? Or by those thousands ofunfortunate working girls, victims to the \"sweating\" system, driven daily toeke out a living by going on the streets? Do your helpless old men and womenthank you for the workhouses; or your poor for the poisonously unhealthydwellings in which they are allowed to breed new generations of diseased,and rickety children, only to put money into the pockets of the insatiableShylocks who own houses? Therefore it is that every sovereign of all those\"millions,\" contributed by good and would-be charitable people, falls like aburning curse instead of a blessing on the poor whom it should relieve. Wecall this generating national Karma, and terrible will be its results on theday of reckoning.  -oOo-Theosophy for the MassesQ. And you think that Theosophy would, by stepping in, help to remove theseevils, under the practical and adverse conditions of our modern life?A. Had we more money, and had not most of the Theosophists to work for theirdaily bread, I firmly believe we could.Q. How? Do you expect that your doctrines could ever take hold of theuneducated masses, when they are so abstruse and difficult thatwell-educated people can hardly understand them?A. You forget one thing, which is that your much-boasted modern education isprecisely that which makes it difficult for you to understand Theosophy.Your mind is so full of intellectual subtleties and preconceptions that yournatural intuition and perception of the truth cannot act. It does notrequire metaphysics or education to make a man understand the broad truthsof Karma and Reincarnation. Look at the millions of poor and uneducatedBuddhists and Hindus, to whom Karma and reincarnation are solid realities,simply because their minds have never been cramped and distorted by beingforced into an unnatural groove. They have never had the innate human senseof justice perverted in them by being told to believe that their sins wouldbe forgiven because another man had been put to death for their sakes. Andthe Buddhists, note well, live up to their beliefs without a murmur againstKarma, or what they regard as a just punishment; whereas the Christianpopulace neither lives up to its moral ideal, nor accepts its lotcontentedly. Hence murmuring and dissatisfaction, and the intensity of thestruggle for existence in Western lands.Q. But this contentedness, which you praise so much, would do away with allmotive for exertion and bring progress to a stand-still.A. And we, Theosophists, say that your vaunted progress and civilization areno better than a host of will-o'-the-wisps, flickering over a marsh whichexhales a poisonous and deadly miasma. This, because we see selfishness,crime, immorality, and all the evils imaginable, pouncing upon unfortunatemankind from this Pandora's box which you call an age of progress, andincreasing pari passu with the growth of your material civilization. At sucha price, better the inertia and inactivity of Buddhist countries, which havearisen only as a consequence of ages of political slavery.Page 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. Then is all this metaphysics and mysticism with which you occupy yourselfso much, of no importance?A. To the masses, who need only practical guidance and support, they are notof much consequence; but for the educated, the natural leaders of themasses, those whose modes of thought and action will sooner or later beadopted by those masses, they are of the greatest importance. It is only bymeans of the philosophy that an intelligent and educated man can avoid theintellectual suicide of believing on blind faith; and it is only byassimilating the strict continuity and logical coherence of the Eastern, ifnot esoteric, doctrines, that he can realize their truth. Conviction breedsenthusiasm, and \"Enthusiasm,\" says Bulwer Lytton, \"is the genius ofsincerity, and truth accomplishes no victories without it;\" while Emersonmost truly remarks that \"every great and commanding movement in the annalsof the world is the triumph of enthusiasm.\" And what is more calculated toproduce such a feeling than a philosophy so grand, so consistent, sological, and so all-embracing as our Eastern Doctrines?Q. And yet its enemies are very numerous, and every day Theosophy acquiresnew opponents.A. And this is precisely that which proves its intrinsic excellence andvalue. People hate only the things they fear, and no one goes out of his wayto overthrow that which neither threatens nor rises beyond mediocrity.Q. Do you hope to impart this enthusiasm, one day, to the masses?A. Why not? Since history tells us that the masses adopted Buddhism withenthusiasm, while, as said before, the practical effect upon them of thisphilosophy of ethics is still shown by the smallness of the percentage ofcrime amongst Buddhist populations as compared with every other religion.The chief point is, to uproot that most fertile source of all crime andimmortality-the belief that it is possible for them to escape theconsequences of their own actions. Once teach them that greatest of alllaws, Karma and Reincarnation, and besides feeling in themselves the truedignity of human nature, they will turn from evil and eschew it as theywould a physical danger.  -oOo-How Members Can Help the SocietyQ. How do you expect the Fellows of your Society to help in the work?A. First by studying and comprehending the theosophical doctrines, so thatthey may teach others, especially the young people. Secondly, by takingevery opportunity of talking to others and explaining to them what Theosophyis, and what it is not; by removing misconceptions and spreading an interestin the subject. Thirdly, by assisting in circulating our literature, bybuying books when they have the means, by lending and giving them and byinducing their friends to do so. Fourthly, by defending the Society from theunjust aspersions cast upon it, by every legitimate device in their power.Fifth, and most important of all, by the example of their own lives.Q. But all this literature, to the spread of which you attach so muchimportance, does not seem to me of much practical use in helping mankind.This is not practical charity.A. We think otherwise. We hold that a good book which gives people food forthought, which strengthens and clears their minds, and enables them to grasptruths which they have dimly felt but could not formulate-we hold that sucha book does a real, substantial good. As to what you call practical deeds ofcharity, to benefit the bodies of our fellowmen, we do what little we can;but, as I have already told you, most of us are poor, whilst the SocietyPage 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtitself has not even the money to pay a staff of workers. All of us who toilfor it, give our labor gratis, and in most cases money as well. The few whohave the means of doing what are usually called charitable actions, followthe Buddhist precepts and do their work themselves, not by proxy or bysubscribing publicly to charitable funds. What the Theosophist has to doabove all is to forget his personality.  -oOo-What a Theosophist Ought Not to DoQ. Have you any prohibitory laws or clauses for Theosophists in yourSociety?A. Many, but-alas!-none of them are enforced. They express the ideal of ourorganization, but the practical application of such things we are compelledto leave to the discretion of the Fellows themselves. Unfortunately, thestate of men's minds in the present century is such that, unless we allowthese clauses to remain, so to speak, obsolete, no man or woman would dareto risk joining the Theosophical Society. This is precisely why I feelforced to lay such a stress on the difference between true Theosophy and itshard-struggling and well-intentioned, but still unworthy vehicle, theTheosophical Society.Q. May I be told what are these perilous reefs in the open sea of Theosophy?A. Well may you call them reefs, as more than one otherwise sincere andwell-meaning F.T.S. has had his Theosophical canoe shattered into splinterson them! And yet to avoid certain things seems the easiest thing in theworld to do. For instance, here is a series of such negatives, screeningpositive Theosophical duties:No Theosophist should be silent when he hears evil reports or slandersspread about the Society, or innocent persons, whether they be hiscolleagues or outsiders.Q. But suppose what one hears is the truth, or may be true without oneknowing it?A. Then you must demand good proofs of the assertion, and hear both sidesimpartially before you permit the accusation to go uncontradicted. You haveno right to believe in evil, until you get undeniable proof of thecorrectness of the statement.Q. And what should you do then?A. Pity and forbearance, charity and long-suffering, ought to be alwaysthere to prompt us to excuse our sinning brethren, and to pass the gentlestsentence possible upon those who err. A Theosophist ought never to forgetwhat is due to the shortcomings and infirmities of human nature.Q. Ought he to forgive entirely in such cases?A. In every case, especially he who is sinned against.Q. But if by so doing, he risks to injure, or allow others to be injured?What ought he to do then?A. His duty; that which his conscience and higher nature suggests to him;but only after mature deliberation. Justice consists in doing no injury toany living being; but justice commands us also never to allow injury to bedone to the many, or even to one innocent person, by allowing the guilty oneto go unchecked.Page 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. What are the other negative clauses?A. No Theosophist ought to be contented with an idle or frivolous life,doing no real good to himself and still less to others. He should work forthe benefit of the few who need his help if he is unable to toil forHumanity, and thus work for the advancement of the Theosophical cause.Q. This demands an exceptional nature, and would come rather hard upon somepersons.A. Then they had better remain outside the T.S. instead of sailing underfalse colors. No one is asked to give more than he can afford, whether indevotion, time, work, or money.Q. What comes next?A. No working member should set too great value on his personal progress orproficiency in Theosophic studies; but must be prepared rather to do as muchaltruistic work as lies in his power. He should not leave the whole of theheavy burden and responsibility of the Theosophical Movement on theshoulders of the few devoted workers. Each member ought to feel it his dutyto take what share he can in the common work, and help it by every means inhis power.Q. This is but just. What comes next?A. No Theosophist should place his personal vanity, or feelings, above thoseof his Society as a body. He who sacrifices the latter, or other people'sreputations on the altar of his personal vanity, worldly benefit, or pride,ought not to be allowed to remain a member. One cancerous limb diseases thewhole body.Q. Is it the duty of every member to teach others and preach Theosophy?A. It is indeed. No fellow has a right to remain idle, on the excuse that heknows too little to teach. For he may always be sure that he will findothers who know still less than himself. And also it is not until a manbegins to try to teach others, that he discovers his own ignorance and triesto remove it. But this is a minor clause.Q. What do you consider, then, to be the chief of these negativeTheosophical duties?A. To be ever prepared to recognize and confess one's faults. To rather sinthrough exaggerated praise than through too little appreciation of one'sneighbor's efforts. Never to backbite or slander another person. Always tosay openly and direct to his face anything you have against him. Never tomake yourself the echo of anything you may hear against another, nor harborrevenge against those who happen to injure you.Q. But it is often dangerous to tell people the truth to their faces. Don'tyou think so? I know one of your members who was bitterly offended, left theSociety, and became its greatest enemy, only because he was told someunpleasant truths to his face, and was blamed for them.A. Of such we have had many. No member, whether prominent or insignificant,has ever left us without becoming our bitter enemy.Q. How do you account for it?A. It is simply this. Having been, in most cases, intensely devoted to theSociety at first, and having lavished upon it the most exaggerated praises,the only possible excuse such a backslider can make for his subsequentbehavior and past short-sightedness, is to pose as an innocent and deceivedPage 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtvictim, thus casting the blame from his own shoulders onto those of theSociety in general, and its leaders especially. Such persons remind one ofthe old fable about the man with a distorted face, who broke hislooking-glass on the ground that it reflected his countenance crookedly.Q. But what makes these people turn against the Society?A. Wounded vanity in some form or other, almost in every case. Generally,because their dicta and advice are not taken as final and authoritative; orelse, because they are of those who would rather reign in Hell than serve inHeaven. Because, in short, they cannot bear to stand second to anybody inanything. So, for instance, one member-a true \"Sir Oracle\"-criticized, andalmost defamed every member in the T.S. to outsiders as much as toTheosophists, under the pretext that they were all untheosophical, blamingthem precisely for what he was himself doing all the time. Finally, he leftthe Society, giving as his reason a profound conviction that we were all(the Founders especially)-Frauds! Another one, after intriguing in everypossible way to be placed at the head of a large Section of the Society,finding that the members would not have him, turned against the Founders ofthe T.S., and became their bitterest enemy, denouncing one of them wheneverhe could, simply because the latter could not, and would not, force him uponthe Members. This was simply a case of an outrageous wounded vanity. Stillanother wanted to, and virtually did, practice black-magic-i.e., unduepersonal psychological influence on certain Fellows, while pretendingdevotion and every Theosophical virtue. When this was put a stop to, theMember broke with Theosophy, and now slanders and lies against the samehapless leaders in the most virulent manner, endeavoring to break up thesociety by blackening the reputation of those whom that worthy \"Fellow\" wasunable to deceive.Q. What would you do with such characters?A. Leave them to their Karma. Because one person does evil that is no reasonfor others to do so.Q. But, to return to slander, where is the line of demarcation betweenbackbiting and just criticism to be drawn? Is it not one's duty to warnone's friends and neighbors against those whom one knows to be dangerousassociates?A. If by allowing them to go on unchecked other persons may be therebyinjured, it is certainly our duty to obviate the danger by warning themprivately. But true or false, no accusation against another person shouldever be spread abroad. If true, and the fault hurts no one but the sinner,then leave him to his Karma. If false, then you will have avoided adding tothe injustice in the world. Therefore, keep silent about such things witheveryone not directly concerned. But if your discretion and silence arelikely to hurt or endanger others, then I add: Speak the truth at all costs,and say, with Annesly, \"Consult duty, not events.\" There are cases when oneis forced to exclaim, \"Perish discretion, rather than allow it to interferewith duty.\"Q. Methinks, if you carry out these maxims, you are likely to reap a nicecrop of troubles!A. And so we do. We have to admit that we are now open to the same taunt asthe early Christians were. \"See, how these Theosophists love one another!\"may now be said of us without a shadow of injustice.Q. Admitting yourself that there is at least as much, if not more,backbiting, slandering, and quarreling in the T.S. as in the ChristianChurches, let alone Scientific Societies-What kind of Brotherhood is this? Imay ask.Page 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. A very poor specimen, indeed, as at present, and, until carefully siftedand reorganized, no better than all others. Remember, however, that humannature is the same in the Theosophical Society as out of it. Its members areno saints: they are at best sinners trying to do better, and liable to fallback owing to personal weakness. Add to this that our \"Brotherhood\" is no\"recognized\" or established body, and stands, so to speak, outside of thepale of jurisdiction. Besides which, it is in a chaotic condition, and asunjustly unpopular as is no other body. What wonder, then, that thosemembers who fail to carry out its ideal should turn, after leaving theSociety, for sympathetic protection to our enemies, and pour all their galland bitterness into their too willing ears! Knowing that they will findsupport, sympathy, and ready credence for every accusation, however absurd,that it may please them to launch against the Theosophical Society, theyhasten to do so, and vent their wrath on the innocent looking-glass, whichreflected too faithfully their faces. People never forgive those whom theyhave wronged. The sense of kindness received, and repaid by them withingratitude, drives them into a madness of self-justification before theworld and their own consciences. The former is but too ready to believe inanything said against a society it hates. The latter-but I will say no more,fearing I have already said too much.Q. Your position does not seem to me a very enviable one.A. It is not. But don't you think that there must be something very noble,very exalted, very true, behind the Society and its philosophy, when theleaders and the founders of the Movement still continue to work for it withall their strength? They sacrifice to it all comfort, all worldlyprosperity, and success, even to their good name and reputation-aye, even totheir honor-to receive in return incessant and ceaseless obloquy, relentlesspersecution, untiring slander, constant ingratitude, and misunderstanding oftheir best efforts, blows, and buffets from all sides-when by simplydropping their work they would find themselves immediately released fromevery responsibility, shielded from every further attack.Q. I confess, such a perseverance seems to me very astounding, and Iwondered why you did all this.A. Believe me for no self-gratification; only in the hope of training a fewindividuals to carry on our work for humanity by its original program whenthe Founders are dead and gone. They have already found a few such noble anddevoted souls to replace them. The coming generations, thanks to these few,will find the path to peace a little less thorny, and the way a littlewidened, and thus all this suffering will have produced good results, andtheir self-sacrifice will not have been in vain. At present, the main,fundamental object of the Society is to sow germs in the hearts of men,which may in time sprout, and under more propitious circumstances lead to ahealthy reform, conducive of more happiness to the masses than they havehitherto enjoyed.On the Misconceptions About the T.S.  Theosophy and AsceticismQ. I have heard people say that your rules require all members to bevegetarians, celibates, and rigid ascetics; but you have not told meanything of the sort yet. Can you tell me the truth once for all about this?A. The truth is that our rules require nothing of the kind. The TheosophicalSociety does not even expect, far less require of any of its members thatthey should be ascetics in any way, except-if you call that asceticism-thatthey should try and benefit other people and be unselfish in their ownlives.Q. But still many of your members are strict vegetarians, and openly avowPage 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txttheir intention of remaining unmarried. This, too, is most often the casewith those who take a prominent part in connection with the work of yourSociety.A. That is only natural, because most of our really earnest workers aremembers of the Inner Section of the Society, which I told you about before.Q. Oh! Then you do require ascetic practices in that Inner Section?A. No; we do not require or enjoin them even there; but I see that I hadbetter give you an explanation of our views on the subject of asceticism ingeneral, and then you will understand about vegetarianism and so on.Q. Please proceed.A. As I have already told you, most people who become really earneststudents of Theosophy, and active workers in our Society, wish to do morethan study theoretically the truths we teach. They wish to know the truth bytheir own direct personal experience, and to study Occultism with the objectof acquiring the wisdom and power, which they feel that they need in orderto help others, effectually and judiciously, instead of blindly and athaphazard. Therefore, sooner or later, they join the Inner Section.Q. But you said that \"ascetic practices\" are not obligatory even in thatInner Section?A. No more they are; but the first thing which the members learn there is atrue conception of the relation of the body, or physical sheath, to theinner, the true man. The relation and mutual interaction between these twoaspects of human nature are explained and demonstrated to them, so that theysoon become imbued with the supreme importance of the inner man over theouter case or body. They are taught that blind unintelligent asceticism ismere folly; that such conduct as that of St. Labro which I spoke of before,or that of the Indian Fakirs and jungle ascetics, who cut, burn, andmacerate their bodies in the most cruel and horrible manner, is simplyself-torture for selfish ends, i.e., to develop will-power, but is perfectlyuseless for the purpose of assisting true spiritual, or Theosophic,development.Q. I see, you regard only moral asceticism as necessary. It is as a means toan end, that end being the perfect equilibrium of the inner nature of man,and the attainment of complete mastery over the body with all its passionsand desires?A. Just so. But these means must be used intelligently and wisely, notblindly and foolishly; like an athlete who is training and preparing for agreat contest, not like the miser who starves himself into illness that hemay gratify his passion for gold.Q. I understand now your general idea; but let us see how you apply it inpractice. How about vegetarianism, for instance?A. One of the great German scientists has shown that every kind of animaltissue, however you may cook it, still retains certain markedcharacteristics of the animal which it belonged to, which characteristicscan be recognized. And apart from that, everyone knows by the taste whatmeat he is eating. We go a step farther, and prove that when the flesh ofanimals is assimilated by man as food, it imparts to him, physiologically,some of the characteristics of the animal it came from. Moreover, occultscience teaches and proves this to its students by ocular demonstration,showing also that this \"coarsening\" or \"animalizing\" effect on man isgreatest from the flesh of the larger animals, less for birds, still lessfor fish and other cold-blooded animals, and least of all when he eats onlyvegetables.Page 120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. Then he had better not eat at all?A. If he could live without eating, of course it would. But as the matterstands, he must eat to live, and so we advise really earnest students to eatsuch food as will least clog and weight their brains and bodies, and willhave the smallest effect in hampering and retarding the development of theirintuition, their inner faculties, and powers.Q. Then you do not adopt all the arguments which vegetarians in general arein the habit of using?A. Certainly not. Some of their arguments are very weak, and often based onassumptions which are quite false. But, on the other hand, many of thethings they say are quite true. For instance, we believe that much disease,and especially the great predisposition to disease which is becoming somarked a feature in our time, is very largely due to the eating of meat, andespecially of tinned meats. But it would take too long to go thoroughly intothis question of vegetarianism on its merits; so please pass onto somethingelse.Q. One question more. What are your members of the Inner Section to do withregard to their food when they are ill?A. Follow the best practical advice they can get, of course. Don't you graspyet that we never impose any hard-and-fast obligations in this respect?Remember once for all that in all such questions we take a rational, andnever a fanatical, view of things. If from illness or long habit a mancannot go without meat, why, by all means let him eat it. It is no crime; itwill only retard his progress a little; for after all is said and done, thepurely bodily actions and functions are of far less importance than what aman thinks and feels, what desires he encourages in his mind, and allows totake root and grow there.Q. Then with regard to the use of wine and spirits, I suppose you do notadvise people to drink them?A. They are worse for his moral and spiritual growth than meat, for alcoholin all its forms has a direct, marked, and very deleterious influence onman's psychic condition. Wine and spirit drinking is only less destructiveto the development of the inner powers, than the habitual use of hashish,opium, and similar drugs.  -oOo-Theosophy and MarriageQ. Now to another question; must a man marry or remain a celibate?A. It depends on the kind of man you mean. If you refer to one who intendsto live in the world, one who, even though a good, earnest Theosophist, andan ardent worker for our cause, still has ties and wishes which bind him tothe world, who, in short, does not feel that he has done forever with whatmen call life, and that he desires one thing and one thing only-to know thetruth, and to be able to help others-then for such a one I say there is noreason why he should not marry, if he likes to take the risks of thatlottery where there are so many more blanks than prizes. Surely you cannotbelieve us so absurd and fanatical as to preach against marriage altogether?On the contrary, save in a few exceptional cases of practical Occultism,marriage is the only remedy against immorality.Q. But why cannot one acquire this knowledge and power when living a marriedlife?Page 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. My dear sir, I cannot go into physiological questions with you; but I cangive you an obvious and, I think, a sufficient answer, which will explain toyou the moral reasons we give for it. Can a man serve two masters? No! Thenit is equally impossible for him to divide his attention between the pursuitof Occultism and a wife. If he tries to, he will assuredly fail in doingeither properly; and, let me remind you, practical Occultism is far tooserious and dangerous a study for a man to take up, unless he is in the mostdeadly earnest, and ready to sacrifice all, himself first of all, to gainhis end. But this does not apply to the members of our Inner Section. I amonly referring to those who are determined to tread that path ofdiscipleship which leads to the highest goal. Most, if not all of those whojoin our Inner Section, are only beginners, preparing themselves in thislife to enter in reality upon that path in lives to come.  -oOo-Theosophy and EducationQ. One of your strongest arguments for the inadequacy of the existing formsof religion in the West, as also to some extent the materialistic philosophywhich is now so popular, but which you seem to consider as an abomination ofdesolation, is the large amount of misery and wretchedness which undeniablyexists, especially in our great cities. But surely you must recognize howmuch has been, and is being done to remedy this state of things by thespread of education and the diffusion of intelligence.A. The future generations will hardly thank you for such a \"diffusion ofintelligence,\" nor will your present education do much good to the poorstarving masses.Q. Ah! But you must give us time. It is only a few years since we began toeducate the people.A. And what, pray, has your Christian religion been doing ever since thefifteenth century, once you acknowledge that the education of the masses hasnot been attempted till now-the very work, if ever there could be one, whicha Christian, i.e., a Christ-following church and people, ought to perform?Q. Well, you may be right; but now-A. Just let us consider this question of education from a broad standpoint,and I will prove to you that you are doing harm not good, with many of yourboasted improvements. The schools for the poorer children, though far lessuseful than they ought to be, are good in contrast with the vilesurroundings to which they are doomed by your modern Society. The infusionof a little practical Theosophy would help a hundred times more in life thepoor suffering masses than all this infusion of (useless) intelligence.Q. But, really-A. Let me finish, please. You have opened a subject on which we Theosophistsfeel deeply, and I must have my say. I quite agree that there is a greatadvantage to a small child bred in the slums, having the gutter forplayground, and living amid continued coarseness of gesture and word, inbeing placed daily in a bright, clean schoolroom hung with pictures, andoften gay with flowers. There it is taught to be clean, gentle, orderly;there it learns to sing and to play; has toys that awaken its intelligence;learns to use its fingers deftly; is spoken to with a smile instead of afrown; is gently rebuked or coaxed instead of cursed. All this humanizes thechildren, arouses their brains, and renders them susceptible to intellectualand moral influences. The schools are not all they might be and ought to be;but, compared with the homes, they are paradises; and they slowly arereacting on the homes. But while this is true of many of the Board schools,your system deserves the worst one can say of it.Page 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. So be it; go on.A. What is the real object of modern education? Is it to cultivate anddevelop the mind in the right direction; to teach the disinherited andhapless people to carry with fortitude the burden of life (allotted them byKarma); to strengthen their will; to inculcate in them the love of one'sneighbor and the feeling of mutual interdependence and brotherhood; and thusto train and form the character for practical life? Not a bit of it. Andyet, these are undeniably the objects of all true education. No one deniesit; all your educators admit it, and talk very big indeed on the subject.But what is the practical result of their action? Every young man and boy,nay, every one of the younger generation of schoolmasters will answer: \"Theobject of modern education is to pass examinations,\" a system not to developright emulation, but to generate and breed jealousy, envy, hatred almost, inyoung people for one another, and thus train them for a life of ferociousselfishness and struggle for honors and emoluments instead of kindlyfeeling.Q. I must admit you are right there.A. And what are these examinations-the terror of modern boyhood and youth?They are simply a method of classification by which the results of yourschool teaching are tabulated. In other words, they form the practicalapplication of the modern science method to the genus homo, quaintellection. Now \"science\" teaches that intellect is a result of themechanical interaction of the brain-stuff; therefore it is only logical thatmodern education should be almost entirely mechanical-a sort of automaticmachine for the fabrication of intellect by the ton. Very little experienceof examinations is enough to show that the education they produce is simplya training of the physical memory, and, sooner or later, all your schoolswill sink to this level. As to any real, sound cultivation of the thinkingand reasoning power, it is simply impossible while everything has to bejudged by the results as tested by competitive examinations. Again, schooltraining is of the very greatest importance in forming character, especiallyin its moral bearing. Now, from first to last, your modern system is basedon the so-called scientific revelations: \"The struggle for existence\" andthe \"survival of the fittest.\" All through his early life, every man hasthese driven into him by practical example and experience, as well as bydirect teaching, till it is impossible to eradicate from his mind the ideathat \"self,\" the lower, personal, animal self, is the end-all, and be-all,of life. Here you get the great source of all the after-misery, crime, andheartless selfishness, which you admit as much as I do. Selfishness, as saidover and over again, is the curse of humanity, and the prolific parent ofall the evils and crimes in this life; and it is your schools which are thehotbeds of such selfishness.Q. That is all very fine as generalities, but I should like a few facts, andto learn also how this can be remedied.A. Very well, I will try and satisfy you. There are three great divisions ofscholastic establishments, board, middle-class and public schools, runningup the scale from the most grossly commercial to the idealistic classical,with many permutations and combinations. The practical commercial begets themodern side, and the ancient and orthodox classical reflects its heavyrespectability even as far as the School Board pupil teacher'sestablishments. Here we plainly see the scientific and material commercialsupplanting the effete orthodox and classical. Neither is the reason veryfar to seek. The objects of this branch of education are, then, pounds,shillings, and pence, the summum bonum of the nineteenth century. Thus, theenergies generated by the brain molecules of its adherents are allconcentrated on one point, and are, therefore, to some extent, an organizedarmy of educated and speculative intellects of the minority of men, trainedagainst the hosts of the ignorant, simple-minded masses doomed to bePage 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtvampirized, lived, and sat upon by their intellectually stronger brethren.Such training is not only untheosophical, it is simply unchristian. Result:The direct outcome of this branch of education is an overflooding of themarket with money-making machines, with heartless selfish men-animals-whohave been most carefully trained to prey on their fellows and take advantageof the ignorance of their weaker brethren!Q. Well, but you cannot assert that of our great public schools, at anyrate?A. Not exactly, it is true. But though the form is different, the animatingspirit is the same: untheosophical and unchristian, whether Eton and Harrowturn out scientists or divines and theologians.Q. Surely you don't mean to call Eton and Harrow \"commercial\"?A. No. Of course the Classical system is above all things respectable, andin the present day is productive of some good. It does still remain thefavorite at our great public schools, where not only an intellectual, butalso a social education is obtainable. It is, therefore, of prime importancethat the dull boys of aristocratic and wealthy parents should go to suchschools to meet the rest of the young life of the \"blood\" and money classes.But unfortunately there is a huge competition even for entrance; for themoneyed classes are increasing, and poor but clever boys seek to enter thepublic schools by the rich scholarships, both at the schools themselves andfrom them to the Universities.Q. According to this view, the wealthier \"dullards\" have to work even harderthan their poorer fellows?A. It is so. But, strange to say, the faithful of the cult of the \"Survivalof the fittest\" do not practice their creed; for their whole exertion is tomake the naturally unfit supplant the fit. Thus, by bribes of large sums ofmoney, they allure the best teachers from their natural pupils tomechanicalize their naturally unfit progeny into professions which theyuselessly overcrowd.Q. And you attribute all this to what?A. All this is owing to the perniciousness of a system which turns out goodsto order, irrespective of the natural proclivities and talents of the youth.The poor little candidate for this progressive paradise of learning, comesalmost straight from the nursery to the treadmill of a preparatory schoolfor sons of gentlemen. Here he is immediately seized upon by the workmen ofthe materio-intellectual factory, and crammed with Latin, French, and GreekAccidence, Dates, and Tables, so that if he have any natural genius it israpidly squeezed out of him by the rollers of what Carlyle has so wellcalled \"dead vocables.\"Q. But surely he is taught something besides \"dead vocables,\" and much ofthat which may lead him direct to Theosophy, if not entirely into theTheosophical Society?A. Not much. For of history, he will attain only sufficient knowledge of hisown particular nation to fit him with a steel armor of prejudice against allother peoples, and be steeped in the foul cesspools of chronicled nationalhate and bloodthirstiness; and surely, you would not call that-Theosophy?Q. What are your further objections?A. Added to this is a smattering of selected, so-called, Biblical facts,from the study of which all intellect is eliminated. It is simply a memorylesson, the \"Why\" of the teacher being a \"Why\" of circumstances and not ofreason.Page 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. Yes; but I have heard you congratulate yourself at the ever-increasingnumber of the Agnostics and Atheists in our day, so that it appears thateven people trained in the system you abuse so heartily do learn to thinkand reason for themselves.A. Yes; but it is rather owing to a healthy reaction from that system thandue to it. We prefer immeasurably more in our Society Agnostics, and evenrank Atheists, to bigots of whatever religion. An Agnostic's mind is everopened to the truth; whereas the latter blinds the bigot like the sun doesan owl. The best-i.e., the most truth-loving, philanthropic, and honest-ofour Fellows were, and are, Agnostics and Atheists (disbelievers in apersonal God). But there are no free-thinking boys and girls, and generallyearly training will leave its mark behind in the shape of a cramped anddistorted mind. A proper and sane system of education should produce themost vigorous and liberal mind, strictly trained in logical and accuratethought, and not in blind faith. How can you ever expect good results, whileyou pervert the reasoning faculty of your children by bidding them believein the miracles of the Bible on Sunday, while for the six other days of theweek you teach them that such things are scientifically impossible?Q. What would you have, then?A. If we had money, we would found schools which would turn out somethingelse than reading and writing candidates for starvation. Children shouldabove all be taught self-reliance, love for all men, altruism, mutualcharity, and more than anything else, to think and reason for themselves. Wewould reduce the purely mechanical work of the memory to an absoluteminimum, and devote the time to the development and training of the innersenses, faculties, and latent capacities. We would endeavor to deal witheach child as a unit, and to educate it so as to produce the most harmoniousand equal unfoldment of its powers, in order that its special aptitudesshould find their full natural development. We should aim at creating freemen and women, free intellectually, free morally, unprejudiced in allrespects, and above all things, unselfish. And we believe that much if notall of this could be obtained by proper and truly theosophical education.  -oOo-Why Then is There So Much Prejudice Against the T.S.?Q. If Theosophy is even half of what you say, why should there exist such aterrible ill-feeling against it? This is even more of a problem thananything else.A. It is; but you must bear in mind how many powerful adversaries we havearoused ever since the formation of our Society. As I just said, if theTheosophical Movement were one of those numerous modern crazes, as harmlessat the end as they are evanescent, it would be simply laughed at-as it isnow by those who still do not understand its real purport-and left severelyalone. But it is nothing of the kind. Intrinsically, Theosophy is the mostserious Movement of this age; and one, moreover, which threatens the verylife of most of the time-honored humbugs, prejudices, and social evils ofthe day-those evils which fatten and make happy the upper ten and theirimitators and sycophants, the wealthy dozens of the middle classes, whilethey positively crush and starve out of existence the millions of the poor.Think of this, and you will easily understand the reason of such arelentless persecution by those others who, more observant andclear-sighted, do see the true nature of Theosophy, and therefore dread it.Q. Do you mean to tell me that it is because a few have understood whatTheosophy leads to, that they try to crush the Movement? But if Theosophyleads only to good, surely you cannot be prepared to utter such a terribleaccusation of faithlessness, heartlessness, and treachery even against thosePage 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtfew?A. I am so prepared, on the contrary. I do not call the enemies we have hadto battle with during the first nine or ten years of the Society's existenceeither powerful or \"dangerous\"; but only those who have arisen against us inthe last three or four years. And these neither speak, write, nor preachagainst Theosophy, but work in silence and behind the backs of the foolishpuppets who act as their visible marionettes. Yet, if invisible to most ofthe members of our Society, they are well known to the true \"Founders\" andthe protectors of our Society. But they must remain for certain reasonsunnamed at present.Q. And are they known to many of you, or to yourself alone?A. I never said I knew them. I may or may not know them-but I know of them,and this is sufficient; and I defy them to do their worst. They may achievegreat mischief and throw confusion into our ranks, especially among thefaint-hearted, and those who can judge only by appearances. They will notcrush the Society, do what they may. Apart from these truly dangerousenemies-\"dangerous,\" however, only to those Theosophists who are unworthy ofthe name, and whose place is rather outside than within the T.S.-the numberof our opponents is more than considerable.Q. Can you name these, at least, if you will not speak of the others?A. Of course I can. We have to contend against:-1. The hatred of the Spiritualists, American, English, and French;2. The constant opposition of the clergy of all denominations;3. Especially the relentless hatred and persecution of the missionaries inIndia;4. This led to the famous and infamous attack on our Theosophical Society bythe Society for Psychical Research, an attack which was stirred up by aregular conspiracy organized by the missionaries in India.5. We must count the defection of various prominent (?) members, for reasonsI have already explained, all of whom have contributed their utmost toincrease the prejudice against us.Q. Cannot you give me more details about these, so that I may know what toanswer when asked-a brief history of the Society, in short; and why theworld believes all this?A. The reason is simple. Most outsiders knew absolutely nothing of theSociety itself, its motives, objects, or beliefs. From its very beginningthe world has seen in Theosophy nothing but certain marvelous phenomena, inwhich two-thirds of the non-Spiritualists do not believe. Very soon theSociety came to be regarded as a body pretending to the possession of\"miraculous\" powers. The world never realized that the Society taughtabsolute disbelief in miracle or even the possibility of such; that in theSociety there were only a few people who possessed such psychic powers andbut few who cared for them. Nor did it understand that the phenomena werenever produced publicly, but only privately for friends, and merely given asan accessory, to prove by direct demonstration that such things could beproduced without dark rooms, spirits, mediums, or any of the usualparaphernalia. Unfortunately, this misconception was greatly strengthenedand exaggerated by the first book on the subject which excited muchattention in Europe-Mr. Sinnett's The Occult World. If this work did much tobring the Society into prominence, it attracted still more obloquy,derision, and misrepresentation upon the hapless heroes and heroine thereof.Of this the author was more than warned in The Occult World, but did not payPage 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtattention to the prophecy-for such it was, though half-veiled.Q. For what, and since when, do the Spiritualists hate you?A. From the first day of the Society's existence. No sooner the fact becameknown that, as a body, the T.S. did not believe in communications with thespirits of the dead, but regarded the so-called \"spirits\" as, for the mostpart, astral reflections of disembodied personalities, shells, etc., thanthe Spiritualists conceived a violent hatred to us and especially to theFounders. This hatred found expression in every kind of slander,uncharitable personal remarks, and absurd misrepresentations of theTheosophical teachings in all the American Spiritualistic organs. For yearswe were persecuted, denounced, and abused. This began in 1875 and continuesto the present day. In 1819, the headquarters of the T.S. were transferredfrom New York to Bombay, India, and then permanently to Madras. When thefirst branch of our Society, the British T.S., was founded in London, theEnglish Spiritualists came out in arms against us, as the Americans haddone; and the French Spiritists followed suit.Q. But why should the clergy be hostile to you, when, after all, the maintendency of the Theosophical doctrines is opposed to Materialism, the greatenemy of all forms of religion in our day?A. The Clergy opposed us on the general principle that \"He who is not withme is against me.\" Since Theosophy does not agree with any one Sect orCreed, it is considered the enemy of all alike, because it teaches that theyare all, more or less, mistaken. The missionaries in India hated and triedto crush us because they saw the flower of the educated Indian youth and theBrahmins, who are almost inaccessible to them, joining the Society in largenumbers. And yet, apart from this general class hatred, the T.S. counts inits ranks' many clergymen, and even one or two bishops.Q. And what led the S.P.R. to take the field against you? You were bothpursuing the same line of study, in some respects, and several of thepsychic researchers belonged to your society.A. First of all we were very good friends with the leaders of the S.P.R.;but when the attack on the phenomena appeared in the Christian CollegeMagazine, supported by the pretended revelations of a menial, the S.P.R.found that they had compromised themselves by publishing in their\"Proceedings\" too many of the phenomena which had occurred in connectionwith the T.S. Their ambition is to pose as an authoritative and strictlyscientific body; so that they had to choose between retaining that positionby throwing overboard the T.S. and even trying to destroy it, and seeingthemselves merged, in the opinion of the Sadducees of the grand monde, withthe \"credulous\" Theosophists and Spiritualists. There was no way for themout of it, no two choices, and they chose to throw us overboard. It was amatter of dire necessity for them. But so hard pressed were they to find anyapparently reasonable motive for the life of devotion and ceaseless laborled by the two Founders, and for the complete absence of any pecuniaryprofit or other advantage to them, that our enemies were obliged to resortto the thrice-absurd, eminently ridiculous, and now famous \"Russian spytheory,\" to explain this devotion. But the old saying, \"The blood of themartyrs is the seed of the Church,\" proved once more correct. After thefirst shock of this attack, the T.S. doubled and tripled its numbers, butthe bad impression produced still remains. A French author was right insaying, \"Calomniez, calomniez toujours et encore, il en restera toujoursquelque chose.\" Therefore it is, that unjust prejudices are current, andthat everything connected with the T.S., and especially with its Founders,is so falsely distorted, because based on malicious hearsay alone.A, Yet in the 14 years during which the Society has existed, you must havehad ample time and opportunity to show yourselves and your work in theirtrue light?Page 127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. How, or when, have we been given such an opportunity? Our most prominentmembers had an aversion to anything that looked like publicly justifyingthemselves. Their policy has ever been: \"We must live it down;\" and \"Whatdoes it matter what the newspapers say, or people think?\" The Society wastoo poor to send out public lecturers, and therefore the expositions of ourviews and doctrines were confined to a few Theosophical works that met withsuccess, but which people often misunderstood, or only knew of throughhearsay. Our journals were, and still are, boycotted; our literary worksignored; and to this day no one seems even to feel quite certain whether theTheosophists are a kind of Serpent-and-Devil worshipers, or simply \"EsotericBuddhists\"-whatever that may mean. It was useless for us to go on denying,day after day and year after year, every kind of inconceivable cock-and-bullstories about us; for, no sooner was one disposed of, than another, a stillmore absurd and malicious one, was born out of the ashes of the first.Unfortunately, human nature is so constituted that any good said of a personis immediately forgotten and never repeated. But one has only to utter aslander, or to start a story-no matter how absurd, false, or incredible itmay be, if only it is connected with some unpopular character-for it to besuccessful and forthwith accepted as a historical fact. Like Don Basilio'sCalumnia, the rumor springs up, at first, as a soft gentle breeze hardlystirring the grass under your feet, and arising no one knows whence; then,in the shortest space of time, it is transformed into a strong wind, beginsto blow a gale, and forthwith becomes a roaring storm! A slander among news,is what an octopus is among fishes; it sucks into one's mind, fastens uponour memory, which feeds upon it, leaving indelible marks even after theslander has been bodily destroyed. A slanderous lie is the only master-keythat will open any and every brain. It is sure to receive welcome andhospitality in every human mind, the highest as the lowest, if only a littleprejudiced, and no matter from however base a quarter and motive it hasstarted.Q. Don't you think your assertion altogether too sweeping? The Englishmanhas never been over-ready to believe in anything said, and our nation isproverbially known for its love of fair play. A lie has no legs to standupon for long, and-A. The Englishman is as ready to believe evil as a man of any other nation;for it is human nature, and not a national feature. As to lies, if they haveno legs to stand upon, according to the proverb, they have exceedingly rapidwings; and they can and do fly farther and wider than any other kind ofnews, in England as elsewhere. Remember lies and slander are the only kindof literature we can always get gratis, and without paying any subscription.We can make the experiment if you like. Will you, who are so interested inTheosophical matters, and have heard so much about us, will you put mequestions on as many of these rumors and \"hearses\" as you can think of? Iwill answer you the truth, and nothing but the truth, subject to thestrictest verification.Q. Before we change the subject, let us have the whole truth on this one.Now, some writers have called your teachings \"immoral and pernicious.\"Others, on the ground that many so-called \"authorities\" and Orientalistsfind in the Indian religions nothing but sex-worship in its many forms,accuse you of teaching nothing better than Phallic worship. They say thatsince modern Theosophy is so closely allied with Eastern, and particularlyIndian, thought, it cannot be free from this taint. Occasionally, even, theygo so far as to accuse European Theosophists of reviving the practicesconnected with this cult. How about this?A. I have heard and read about this before; and I answer that no moreutterly baseless and lying slander has ever been invented and circulated.\"Silly people can see but silly dreams,\" says a Russian proverb. It makesone's blood boil to hear such vile accusations made without the slightestfoundation, and on the strength of mere inferences. Ask the hundreds ofPage 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txthonorable English men and women who have been members of the TheosophicalSociety for years whether an immoral precept or a pernicious doctrine wasever taught to them. Open The Secret Doctrine, and you will find page afterpage denouncing the Jews and other nations precisely on account of thisdevotion to Phallic rites, due to the dead letter interpretation of naturesymbolism, and the grossly materialistic conceptions of her dualism in allthe exoteric creeds. Such ceaseless and malicious misrepresentation of ourteachings and beliefs is really disgraceful.Q. But you cannot deny that the Phallic element does exist in the religionsof the East?A. Nor do I deny it; only I maintain that this proves no more than does itspresence in Christianity, the religion of the West. Read Hargrave Jenning'sRosicrucians, if you would assure yourself of it. In the East, the Phallicsymbolism is, perhaps, more crude, because more true to nature, or, I wouldrather say, more naive and sincere than in the West. But it is not morelicentious, nor does it suggest to the Oriental mind the same gross andcoarse ideas as to the Western, with, perhaps, one or two exceptions, suchas the shameful sect known as the \"Maharaja,\" or Vallabhacharya sect.Q. A writer in the Agnostic journal-one of your accusers-has just hintedthat the followers of this disgraceful sect are Theosophists, and \"claimtrue Theosophic insight.\"A. He wrote a falsehood, and that's all. There never was, nor is there atpresent, one single Vallabhacharya in our Society. As to their having, orclaiming Theosophic insight, that is another fib, based on crass ignoranceabout the Indian Sects. Their \"Maharaja\" only claims a right to the money,wives, and daughters of his foolish followers and no more. This sect isdespised by all the other Hindus.But you will find the whole subject dealt with at length in The SecretDoctrine, to which I must again refer you for detailed explanations. Toconclude, the very soul of Theosophy is dead against Phallic worship; andits occult or esoteric section more so even than the exoteric teachings.There never was a more lying statement made than the above. And now ask mesome other questions.  -oOo-Is the Theosophical Society A Money-Making Concern?Q. Agreed. Well, have either of the Founders, Colonel H.S. Olcott or H.P.Blavatsky, ever made any money, profit, or derived any worldly benefit fromthe T.S., as some papers say?A. Not one penny. The papers lie. On the contrary, they have both given allthey had, and literally beggared themselves. As for \"worldly benefits,\"think of the slanders and vilification they have been subjected to, and thenask the question!Q. Yet I have read in a good many missionary organs that the entrance feesand subscriptions much more than covered all expenses; and one said that theFounders were making twenty thousand pounds a year!A. This is a fib, like many others. In the published accounts of January,1889, you will find an exact statement of all the money ever received fromany source since 1879. The total received from all sources (entrance fees,donations, etc., etc.) during these ten years is under six thousand pounds,and of this a large part was contributed by the Founders themselves from theproceeds of their private resources and their literary work. All this hasbeen openly and officially admitted, even by our enemies, the Society forPsychical Research. And now both the Founders are penniless: one, too oldPage 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtand ill to work as she did before, unable to spare time for outside literarywork to help the Society in money, can only write for the Theosophicalcause; the other keeps laboring for it as before, and receives as littlethanks for it.Q. But surely they need money to live?A. Not at all. So long as they have food and lodging, even though they oweit to the devotion of a few friends, they need little more.Q. But could not Madame Blavatsky, especially, make more than enough to liveupon by her writings?A. When in India she received on the average some thousand rupees a year forarticles contributed to Russian and other papers, but gave it all away tothe Society.Q. Political articles?A. Never. Everything she has written throughout the seven years of her stayin India is all there in print. It deals only with the religions, ethnology,and customs of India, and with Theosophy-never with politics, of which sheknows nothing and cares less. Again, two years ago she refused severalcontracts amounting together to about 1,200 rubles in gold per month; forshe could not accept them without abandoning her work for the Society, whichneeded all her time and strength. She has documents to prove it.Q. But why could not both she and Colonel Olcott do as others-notably manyTheosophists-do: follow out their respective professions and devote thesurplus of their time to the work of the Society?A. Because by serving two masters, either the professional or thephilanthropic work would have had to suffer. Every true Theosophist ismorally bound to sacrifice the personal to the impersonal, his own presentgood to the future benefit of other people. If the Founders do not set theexample, who will?Q. And are there many who follow it?A. I am bound to answer you the truth. In Europe about half-a-dozen in all,out of more than that number of Branches.Q. Then it is not true that the Theosophical Society has a large capital orendowment of its own?A. It is false, for it has none at all. Now that the entrance fee of £1 andthe small annual due have been abolished, it is even a doubtful questionwhether the staff at the headquarters in India will not soon be starved todeath.Q. Then why not raise subscriptions?A. We are not the Salvation Army; we cannot and have never begged; nor havewe ever followed the example of the Churches and sects and \"taken upcollections.\" That which is occasionally sent for the support of theSociety, the small sums contributed by some devoted Fellows, are allvoluntary donations.Q. But I have heard of large sums of money given to Mme. Blavatsky. It wassaid four years ago that she got £5,000 from one rich, young \"Fellow,\" whowent out to join them in India, and £10,000 from another wealthy andwell-known American gentleman, one of your members who died in Europe fouryears ago.Page 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. Say to those who told you this, that they either themselves utter, orrepeat, a gross falsehood. Never has \"Madame Blavatsky\" asked or receivedone penny from the two above-named gentlemen, nor anything like that fromanyone else, since the Theosophical Society was founded. Let any man livingtry to substantiate this slander, and it will be easier for him to provethat the Bank of England is bankrupt than that the said \"Founder\" has evermade any money out of Theosophy. These two slanders have been started by twohigh-born ladies, belonging to the London aristocracy, and have beenimmediately traced and disproved. They are the dead bodies, the carcasses oftwo inventions, which, after having been buried in the sea of oblivion, areonce more raised on the surface of the stagnant waters of slander.Q. Then I have been told of several large legacies left to the T.S. One-some£8,000-was left to it by some eccentric Englishman, who did not even belongto the Society. The other-£3,000 or £4,000-were testated by an AustralianF.T.S. Is this true?A. I heard of the first; and I also know that, whether legally left or not,the T.S. has never profited by it, nor have the Founders ever beenofficially notified of it. For, as our Society was not then a charteredbody, and thus had no legal existence, the Judge at the Court of Probate, aswe were told, paid no attention to such legacy and turned over the sum tothe heirs. So much for the first. As for the second, it is quite true. Thetestator was one of our devoted Fellows, and willed all he had to the T.S.But when the President, Colonel Olcott, came to look into the matter, hefound that the testator had children whom he had disinherited for somefamily reasons. Therefore, he called a council, and it was decided that thelegacy should be refused, and the moneys passed to the legal heirs. TheTheosophical Society would be untrue to its name were it to profit by moneyto which others are entitled virtually, at any rate on Theosophicalprinciples, if not legally.Q. Again, and I say this on the authority of your own Journal, TheTheosophist, there's a R ja of India who donated to the Society 25,000rupees. Have you not thanked him for his great bounty in the JanuaryTheosophist for 1888?A. We have, in these words, \"That the thanks of the Convention be conveyedto H.H. the Mah r ja ... for his promised generous gift of Rupees 25,000 tothe Society's Fund.\" The thanks were duly conveyed, but the money is still a\"promise,\" and has never reached the Headquarters.Q. But surely, if the Mah r ja promised and received thanks for his giftpublicly and in print, he will be as good as his promise?A. He may, though the promise is 18 months old. I speak of the present andnot of the future.Q. Then how do you propose to go on?A. So long as the T.S. has a few devoted members willing to work for itwithout reward and thanks, so long as a few good Theosophists support itwith occasional donations, so long will it exist, and nothing can crush it.Q. I have heard many Theosophists speak of a \"power behind the Society\" andof certain \"Mahatmas,\" mentioned also in Mr. Sinnett's works, that are saidto have founded the Society, to watch over and protect it.A. You may laugh, but it is so.  -oOo-The Working Staff of the T.S.Page 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtQ. These men, I have heard, are great Adepts, Alchemists, and what not. If,then, they can change lead into gold and make as much money as they like,besides doing all kinds of miracles at will, as related in Mr. Sinnett's TheOccult World, why do not they find you money, and support the Founders andthe Society in comfort?A. Because they did not found a \"miracle club.\" Because the Society isintended to help men to develop the powers latent in them through their ownexertions and merit. Because whatever they may or may not produce in the wayof phenomena, they are not false coiners; nor would they throw an additionaland very strong temptation on the path of members and candidates: Theosophyis not to be bought. Hitherto, for the past 14 years, not a single workingmember has ever received pay or salary from either the Masters or theSociety.Q. Then are none of your workers paid at all?A. Till now, not one. But as everyone has to eat, drink, and clothe himself,all those who are without any means of their own, and devote their wholetime to the work of the Society, are provided with the necessaries of lifeat the Headquarters at Madras, India, though these \"necessaries\" are humbleenough, in truth! But now that the Society's work has increased so greatlyand still goes on increasing (owing to slanders) in Europe, we need moreworking hands. We hope to have a few members who will henceforth beremunerated-if the word can be used in the cases in question. For every oneof these Fellows, who are preparing to give all their time to the Society,are quitting good official situations with excellent prospects, to work forus at less than half their former salary.Q. And who will provide the funds for this?A. Some of our Fellows who are just a little richer than the rest. The manwho would speculate or make money on Theosophy would be unworthy to remainin our ranks.Q. But you must surely make money by your books, magazines, and otherpublications?A. The Theosophist of Madras, alone among the magazines, pays a profit, andthis has regularly been turned over to the Society, year by year, as thepublished accounts show. Lucifer is slowly but steadily engulfing money,never yet having paid its expenses-thanks to its being boycotted by thepious booksellers and railway stalls. The Lotus, in France-started on theprivate and not very large means of a Theosophist, who has devoted to it hiswhole time and labor-has ceased to exist, owing to the same causes, alas!Nor does the New York Path pay its way, while the Revue Théosophique ofParis has only just been started, also from the private means of alady-member. Moreover, whenever any of the works issued by the TheosophicalPublishing Company in London do pay, the proceeds will be devoted to theservice of the Society.Q. And now please tell me all you can about the Mahatmas. So many absurd andcontradictory things are said about them, that one does not know what tobelieve, and all sorts of ridiculous stories become current.A. Well may you call them \"ridiculous!\"The \"Theosophical Mahatmas\" Are They \"Spirits of Light\" or \"Goblins Damned\"?Q. Who are they, finally, those whom you call your \"Masters\"? Some say theyare \"Spirits,\" or some other kind of supernatural beings, while others callthem \"myths.\"Page 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. They are neither. I once heard one outsider say to another that they werea sort of male mermaids, whatever such a creature may be. But if you listento what people say, you will never have a true conception of them. In thefirst place they are living men, born as we are born, and doomed to die likeevery other mortal.Q. Yes, but it is rumored that some of them are a thousand years old. Isthis true?A. As true as the miraculous growth of hair on the head of Meredith'sShagpat. Truly, like the \"Identical,\" no Theosophical shaving has hithertobeen able to crop it. The more we deny them, the more we try to set peopleright, the more absurd do the inventions become. I have heard of Methuselahbeing 969 years old; but, not being forced to believe in it, have laughed atthe statement, for which I was forthwith regarded by many as a blasphemousheretic.Q. Seriously, though, do they outlive the ordinary age of men?A. What do you call the ordinary age? I remember reading in The Lancet of aMexican who was almost 190 years old; but I have never heard of mortal man,layman, or Adept, who could live even half the years allotted to Methuselah.Some Adepts do exceed, by a good deal, what you would call the ordinary age;yet there is nothing miraculous in it, and very few of them care to livevery long.Q. But what does the word Mahatma really mean?A. Simply a \"great soul,\" great through moral elevation and intellectualattainment. If the title of \"Great\" is given to a drunken soldier likeAlexander, why should we not call those \"Great\" who have achieved fargreater conquests in Nature's secrets, than Alexander ever did on the fieldof battle? Besides, the term is an Indian and a very old word.Q. And why do you call them \"Masters\"?A. We call them \"Masters\" because they are our teachers; and because fromthem we have derived all the Theosophical truths, however inadequately someof us may have expressed, and others understood, them. They are men of greatlearning, whom we term Initiates, and still greater holiness of life. Theyare not ascetics in the ordinary sense, though they certainly remain apartfrom the turmoil and strife of your western world.Q. But is it not selfish thus to isolate themselves?A. Where is the selfishness? Does not the fate of the Theosophical Societysufficiently prove that the world is neither ready to recognize them nor toprofit by their teaching? Of what use would Professor Clerk Maxwell havebeen to instruct a class of little boys in their multiplication table?Besides, they isolate themselves only from the West. In their own countrythey go about as publicly as other people do.Q. Don't you ascribe to them supernatural powers?A. We believe in nothing supernatural, as I have told you already. HadEdison lived and invented his phonograph two hundred years ago, he wouldmost probably have been burnt along with it, and the whole attributed to thedevil. The powers which they exercise are simply the development ofpotencies lying latent in every man and woman, and the existence of whicheven official science begins to recognize.Q. Is it true that these men inspire some of your writers, and that many, ifnot all, of your Theosophical works were written under their dictation?Page 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. Some have. There are passages entirely dictated by them verbatim, but inmost cases they only inspire the ideas and leave the literary form to thewriters.Q. But this in itself is miraculous; is, in fact, a miracle. How can they doit?A. My dear Sir, you are laboring under a great mistake, and it is scienceitself that will refute your arguments at no distant day. Why should it be a\"miracle,\" as you call it? A miracle is supposed to mean some operationwhich is supernatural, whereas there is really nothing above or beyondNature and Nature's laws. Among the many forms of the \"miracle\" which havecome under modern scientific recognition, there is Hypnotism, and one phaseof its power is known as \"Suggestion,\" a form of thought transference, whichhas been successfully used in combating particular physical diseases, etc.The time is not far distant when the World of Science will be forced toacknowledge that there exists as much interaction between one mind andanother, no matter at what distance, as between one body and another inclosest contact. When two minds are sympathetically related, and theinstruments through which they function are tuned to respond magneticallyand electrically to one another, there is nothing which will prevent thetransmission of thoughts from one to the other, at will; for since the mindis not of a tangible nature, that distance can divide it from the subject ofits contemplation, it follows that the only difference that can existbetween two minds is a difference of state. So if this latter hindrance isovercome, where is the \"miracle\" of thought transference, at whateverdistance?Q. But you will admit that Hypnotism does nothing so miraculous or wonderfulas that?A. On the contrary, it is a well-established fact that a Hypnotist canaffect the brain of his subject so far as to produce an expression of hisown thoughts, and even his words, through the organism of his subject; andalthough the phenomena attaching to this method of actual thoughttransference are as yet few in number, no one, I presume, will undertake tosay how far their action may extend in the future, when the laws that governtheir production are more scientifically established. And so, if suchresults can be produced by the knowledge of the mere rudiments of Hypnotism,what can prevent the Adept in Psychic and Spiritual powers from producingresults which, with your present limited knowledge of their laws, you areinclined to call \"miraculous\"? 1. Then why do not our physicians experiment and try if they could not do as much? *)*) Like e.g. prof. Bernheim and Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey in England, profs.Beaunis and Ligeois in Nancy, Delboeuf in Liège, Burot en Bourru inRochefort, Fontain and Sigard in Bordeaux, Forel in Zrich, and thephysicians Despine in Marseille, Van Renterghem and Van Eeden in Amsterdam,Wetterstrand in Stockholm, Schrenck-Notzing in Leipzig and many otherrespected physicians and writers.A. Because, first of all, they are not Adepts with a thorough understandingof the secrets and laws of psychic and spiritual realms, but materialists,afraid to step outside the narrow groove of matter; and, secondly, becausethey must fail at present, and indeed until they are brought to acknowledgethat such powers are attainable.Q. And could they be taught?A. Not unless they were first of all prepared, by having the materialisticdross they have accumulated in their brains swept away to the very lastPage 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtatom.Q. This is very interesting. Tell me, have the Adepts thus inspired ordictated to many of your Theosophists?A. No, on the contrary, to very few. Such operations require specialconditions. An unscrupulous but skilled Adept of the Black Brotherhood(\"Brothers of the Shadow,\" and Dugpas, we call them) has far lessdifficulties to labor under. For, having no laws of the Spiritual kind totrammel his actions, such a Dugpa \"sorcerer\" will most unceremoniouslyobtain control over any mind, and subject it entirely to his evil powers.But our Masters will never do that. They have no right, except by fallinginto Black Magic, to obtain full mastery over anyone's immortal Ego, and cantherefore act only on the physical and psychic nature of the subject,leaving thereby the free will of the latter wholly undisturbed. Hence,unless a person has been brought into psychic relationship with the Masters,and is assisted by virtue of his full faith in, and devotion to, hisTeachers, the latter, whenever transmitting their thoughts to one with whomthese conditions are not fulfilled, experience great difficulties inpenetrating into the cloudy chaos of that person's sphere. But this is noplace to treat of a subject of this nature. Suffice it to say, that if thepower exists, then there are Intelligences (embodied or disembodied) whichguide this power, and living conscious instruments through whom it istransmitted and by whom it is received. We have only to beware of blackmagic.Q. But what do you really mean by \"black magic\"?A. Simply abuse of psychic powers, or of any secret of nature; the fact ofapplying to selfish and sinful ends the powers of Occultism. A hypnotist,who, taking advantage of his powers of \"suggestion,\" forces a subject tosteal or murder, would be called a black magician by us. The famous\"rejuvenating system\" of Dr. Brown-Sequard, of Paris, through a loathsomeanimal injection into human blood-a discovery all the medical papers ofEurope are now discussing-if true, is unconscious black magic.Q. But this is medieval belief in witchcraft and sorcery! Even Law itselfhas ceased to believe in such things?A. So much the worse for law, as it has been led, through such a lack ofdiscrimination, into committing more than one judiciary mistake and crime.It is the term alone that frightens you with its \"superstitious\" ring in it.Would not law punish an abuse of hypnotic powers, as I just mentioned? Nay,it has so punished it already in France and Germany; yet it wouldindignantly deny that it applied punishment to a crime of evident sorcery.You cannot believe in the efficacy and reality of the powers of suggestionby physicians and mesmerizers (or hypnotists), and then refuse to believe inthe same powers when used for evil motives. And if you do, then you believein Sorcery. You cannot believe in good and disbelieve in evil, acceptgenuine money and refuse to credit such a thing as false coin. Nothing canexist without its contrast, and no day, no light, no good could have anyrepresentation as such in your consciousness, were there no night, darkness,nor evil to offset and contrast them.Q. Indeed, I have known men, who, while thoroughly believing in that whichyou call great psychic, or magic powers, laughed at the very mention ofWitchcraft and Sorcery.A. What does it prove? Simply that they are illogical. So much the worse forthem, again. And we, knowing as we do of the existence of good and holyAdepts, believe as thoroughly in the existence of bad and unholy Adepts,or-Dugpas.Q. But if the Masters exist, why don't they come out before all men andPage 135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtrefute once for all the many charges which are made against Mme. Blavatskyand the Society?A. What charges?Q. That they do not exist, and that she has invented them. That they are menof straw, \"Mahatmas of muslin and bladders.\" Does not all this injure herreputation?A. In what way can such an accusation injure her in reality? Did she evermake money on their presumed existence, or derive benefit, or fame,therefrom? I answer that she has gained only insults, abuse, and slanders,which would have been very painful had she not learned long ago to remainperfectly indifferent to such false charges. For what does it amount to,after all? Why, to an implied compliment, which, if the fools, her accusers,were not carried away by their blind hatred, they would have thought twicebefore uttering. To say that she has invented the Masters comes to this: Shemust have invented every bit of philosophy that has ever been given out inTheosophical literature. She must be the author of the letters from whichEsoteric Buddhism was written; the sole inventor of every tenet found in TheSecret Doctrine, which, if the world were just, would be recognized assupplying many of the missing links of science, as will be discovered ahundred years hence. By saying what they do, they are also giving her thecredit of being far cleverer than the hundreds of men-many very clever andnot a few scientific men-who believe in what she says, inasmuch as she musthave fooled them all! If they speak the truth, then she must be severalMahatmas rolled into one like a nest of Chinese boxes; since among theso-called \"Mahatma letters\" are many in totally different and distinctstyles, all of which her accusers declare that she has written.Q. It is just what they say. But is it not very painful to her to bepublicly denounced as \"the most accomplished impostor of the age, whose namedeserves to pass to posterity,\" as is done in the Report of the Society forPsychical Research?A. It might be painful if it were true, or came from people less rabidlymaterialistic and prejudiced. As it is, personally she treats the wholematter with contempt, while the Mahatmas simply laugh at it. In truth, it isthe greatest compliment that could be paid to her. I say so, again.Q. But her enemies claim to have proved their case.A. Aye, it is easy enough to make such a claim when you have constitutedyourself judge, jury, and prosecuting counsel at once, as they did. But who,except their direct followers and our enemies, believe in it?Q. But they sent a representative to India to investigate the matter, didn'tthey?A. They did, and their final conclusion rests entirely on the uncheckedstatements and unverified assertions of this young gentleman. A lawyer whoread through his report told a friend of mine that in all his experience hehad never seen \"such a ridiculous and self-condemnatory document.\" It wasfound to be full of suppositions and \"working hypotheses\" which mutuallydestroyed each other. Is this a serious charge?Q. Yet it has done the Society great harm. Why, then, did she not vindicateher own character, at least, before a Court of Law?A. Because:-1. As a Theosophist, it is her duty to leave unheeded all personal insults.2. Neither the Society nor Mme. Blavatsky had any money to waste over such aPage 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtlawsuit.3. It would have been ridiculous for both to be untrue to their principles,because of an attack made on them by a flock of stupid old British wethers,who had been led to butt at them by an over-frolicsome lambkin fromAustralia.Q. This is complimentary. But do you not think that it would have done realgood to the cause of Theosophy, if she had authoritatively disproved thewhole thing once for all?A. Perhaps. But do you believe that any English jury or judge would haveever admitted the reality of psychic phenomena, even if entirelyunprejudiced beforehand? And when you remember that they would have been setagainst us already by the \"Russian Spy\" scare, the charge of Atheism andinfidelity, and all the other slanders that have been circulated against us,you cannot fail to see that such an attempt to obtain justice in a Court ofLaw would have been worse than fruitless! All this the psychic researchersknew well, and they took a base and mean advantage of their position toraise themselves above our heads and save themselves at our expense.Q. The S.P.R. now denies completely the existence of the Mahatmas. They saythat from beginning to end they were a romance which Madame Blavatsky haswoven from her own brain?A. Well, she might have done many things less clever than this. At any rate,we have not the slightest objection to this theory. As she always says now,she almost prefers that people should not believe in the Masters. Shedeclares openly that she would rather people should seriously think that theonly Mahatmaland is the grey matter of her brain, and that, in short, shehas evolved them out of the depths of her own inner consciousness, than thattheir names and grand ideal should be so infamously desecrated as they areat present. At first she used to protest indignantly against any doubts asto their existence. Now she never goes out of her way to prove or disproveit. Let people think what they like.Q. But, of course, these Masters do exist?A. We affirm they do. Nevertheless, this does not help much. Many people,even some Theosophists and ex-Theosophists, say that they have never had anyproof of their existence. Very well; then Mme. Blavatsky replies with thisalternative: If she has invented them, then she has also invented theirphilosophy and the practical knowledge which some few have acquired; and ifso, what does it matter whether they do exist or not, since she herself ishere, and her own existence, at any rate, can hardly be denied? If theknowledge supposed to have been imparted by them is good intrinsically, andit is accepted as such by many persons of more than average intelligence,why should there be such a hullabaloo made over that question? The fact ofher being an impostor has never been proved, and will always remain subjudice; whereas it is a certain and undeniable fact that, by whomsoeverinvented, the philosophy preached by the \"Masters\" is one of the grandestand most beneficent philosophies once it is properly understood. Thus theslanderers, while moved by the lowest and meanest feelings-those of hatred,revenge, malice, wounded vanity, or disappointed ambition-seem quite unawarethat they are paying the greatest tribute to her intellectual powers. So beit, if the poor fools will have it so. Really, Mme. Blavatsky has not theslightest objection to being represented by her enemies as a triple Adept,and a \"Mahatma\" to boot. It is only her unwillingness to pose in her ownsight as a crow parading in peacock's feathers that compels her to this dayto insist upon the truth.Q. But if you have such wise and good men to guide the Society, how is itthat so many mistakes have been made?Page 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. The Masters do not guide the Society, not even the Founders; and no onehas ever asserted that they did: they only watch over, and protect it. Thisis amply proved by the fact that no mistakes have been able to cripple it,and no scandals from within, nor the most damaging attacks from without,have been able to overthrow it. The Masters look at the future, not at thepresent, and every mistake is so much more accumulated wisdom for days tocome. That other \"Master\" who sent the man with the five talents did nottell him how to double them, nor did he prevent the foolish servant fromburying his one talent in the earth. Each must acquire wisdom by his ownexperience and merits. The Christian Churches, who claim a far higher\"Master,\" the very Holy Ghost itself, have ever been and are still guiltynot only of \"mistakes,\" but of a series of bloody crimes throughout theages. Yet, no Christian would deny, for all that, his belief in that\"Master\"-I suppose?-although his existence is far more hypothetical thanthat of the Mahatmas; as no one has ever seen the Holy Ghost, and hisguidance of the Church, moreover, their own ecclesiastical historydistinctly contradicts. Errare humanum est. Let us return to our subject.  -oOo-The Abuse of Sacred Names and TermsQ. Then, what I have heard, namely, that many of your Theosophical writersclaim to have been inspired by these Masters, or to have seen and conversedwith them, is not true?A. It may or it may not be true. How can I tell? The burden of proof restswith them. Some of them, a few-very few, indeed-have distinctly either liedor were hallucinated when boasting of such inspiration; others were trulyinspired by great Adepts. The tree is known by its fruits; and as allTheosophists have to be judged by their deeds and not by what they write orsay, so all Theosophical books must be accepted on their merits, and notaccording to any claim to authority which they may put forward.Q. But would Mme. Blavatsky apply this to her own works-The Secret Doctrine,for instance?A. Certainly; she says expressly in the Preface that she gives out thedoctrines that she has learnt from the Masters, but claims no inspirationwhatever for what she has lately written. As for our best Theosophists, theywould also in this case far rather that the names of the Masters had neverbeen mixed up with our books in any way. With few exceptions, most of suchworks are not only imperfect, but positively erroneous and misleading. Greatare the desecrations to which the names of two of the Masters have beensubjected. There is hardly a medium who has not claimed to have seen them.Every bogus swindling Society, for commercial purposes, now claims to beguided and directed by \"Masters,\" often supposed to be far higher than ours!Many and heavy are the sins of those who advanced these claims, promptedeither by desire for material gain, vanity, or irresponsible mediumship.Many persons have been plundered of their money by such societies, whichoffer to sell the secrets of power, knowledge, and spiritual truth forworthless gold. Worst of all, the sacred names of Occultism and the holykeepers thereof have been dragged in this filthy mire, polluted by beingassociated with sordid motives and immoral practices, while thousands of menhave been held back from the path of truth and light through the discreditand evil report which such shams, swindles, and frauds have brought upon thewhole subject. I say again, every earnest Theosophist regrets today, fromthe bottom of his heart, that these sacred names and things have ever beenmentioned before the public, and fervently wishes that they had been keptsecret within a small circle of trusted and devoted friends.Q. The names certainly do occur very frequently now-a-days, and I neverremember hearing of such persons as \"Masters\" till quite recently.Page 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. It is so; and had we acted on the wise principle of silence, instead ofrushing into notoriety and publishing all we knew and heard, suchdesecration would never have occurred. Behold, only fourteen years ago,before the Theosophical Society was founded, all the talk was of \"Spirits.\"They were everywhere, in everyone's mouth; and no one by any chance evendreamt of talking about living \"Adepts,\" \"Mahatmas,\" or \"Masters.\" Onehardly heard even the name of the Rosicrucians, while the existence of sucha thing as \"Occultism\" was suspected even but by very few. Now all that ischanged. We Theosophists were, unfortunately, the first to talk of thesethings, to make the fact of the existence in the East of \"Adepts\" and\"Masters\" and Occult knowledge known; and now the name has become commonproperty. It is on us, now, that the Karma, the consequences of theresulting desecration of holy names and things, has fallen. All that you nowfind about such matters in current literature-and there is not a little ofit-all is to be traced back to the impulse given in this direction by theTheosophical Society and its Founders. Our enemies profit to this day by ourmistake. The most recent book directed against our teachings is alleged tohave been written by an Adept of twenty years' standing. Now, it is apalpable lie. We know the amanuensis and his inspirers (as he is himself tooignorant to have written anything of the sort). These \"inspirers\" are livingpersons, revengeful and unscrupulous in proportion to their intellectualpowers; and these bogus Adepts are not one, but several. The cycle of\"Adepts,\" used as sledge-hammers to break the theosophical heads with, begantwelve years ago, with Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten's \"Louis\" of Art Magic andGhostland, and now ends with the \"Adept\" and \"Author\" of The Light of Egypt,a work written by Spiritualists against Theosophy and its teachings. But itis useless to grieve over what is done, and we can only suffer in the hopethat our indiscretions may have made it a little easier for others to findthe way to these Masters, whose names are now everywhere taken in vain, andunder cover of which so many iniquities have already been perpetrated.Q. Do you reject \"Louis\" as an Adept?A. We denounce no one, leaving this noble task to our enemies. TheSpiritualistic author of Art Magic, etc., may or may not have beenacquainted with such an Adept-and saying this, I say far less than what thatlady has said and written about us and Theosophy for the last severalyears-that is her own business. Only when, in a solemn scene of mysticvision, an alleged \"Adept\" sees \"spirits\" presumably at Greenwich, England,through Lord Rosse's telescope, which was built in, and never moved from,Parsonstown, Ireland, I may well be permitted to wonder at the ignorance ofthat \"Adept\" in matters of science. This beats all the mistakes and blunderscommitted at times by the Chelas of our Teachers! And it is this \"Adept\"that is used now to break the teachings of our Masters!Q. I quite understand your feeling in this matter, and think it onlynatural. And now, in view of all that you have said and explained to me,there is one subject on which I should like to ask you a few questions.A. If I can answer them I will. What is that?Conclusion The Future of the Theosophical SocietyQ. Tell me, what do you expect for Theosophy in the future?A. If you speak of Theosophy, I answer that, as it has existed eternallythroughout the endless cycles upon cycles of the Past, so it will ever existthroughout the infinitude of the Future, because Theosophy is synonymouswith everlasting truth.Q. Pardon me; I meant to ask you rather about the prospects of theTheosophical Society.Page 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. Its future will depend almost entirely upon the degree of selflessness,earnestness, devotion, and last, but not least, on the amount of knowledgeand wisdom possessed by those members, on whom it will fall to carry on thework, and to direct the Society after the death of the Founders.Q. I quite see the importance of their being selfless and devoted, but I donot quite grasp how their knowledge can be as vital a factor in the questionas these other qualities. Surely the literature which already exists, and towhich constant additions are still being made, ought to be sufficient?A. I do not refer to technical knowledge of the esoteric doctrine, thoughthat is most important; I spoke rather of the great need which oursuccessors in the guidance of the Society will have of unbiased and clearjudgment. Every such attempt as the Theosophical Society has hitherto endedin failure, because, sooner or later, it has degenerated into a sect, set uphard-and-fast dogmas of its own, and so lost by imperceptible degrees thatvitality which living truth alone can impart. You must remember that all ourmembers have been bred and born in some creed or religion, that all are moreor less of their generation both physically and mentally, and consequentlythat their judgment is but too likely to be warped and unconsciously biasedby some or all of these influences. If, then, they cannot be freed from suchinherent bias, or at least taught to recognize it instantly and so avoidbeing led away by it, the result can only be that the Society will drift offonto some sandbank of thought or another, and there remain a strandedcarcass to molder and die.Q. But if this danger be averted?A. Then the Society will live on into and through the twentieth century. Itwill gradually leaven and permeate the great mass of thinking andintelligent people with its large-minded and noble ideas of Religion, Duty,and Philanthropy. Slowly but surely it will burst asunder the iron fettersof creeds and dogmas, of social and caste prejudices; it will break downracial and national antipathies and barriers, and will open the way to thepractical realization of the Brotherhood of all men. Through its teaching,through the philosophy which it has rendered accessible and intelligible tothe modern mind, the West will learn to understand and appreciate the Eastat its true value. Further, the development of the psychic powers andfaculties, the premonitory symptoms of which are already visible in America,will proceed healthily and normally. Mankind will be saved from the terribledangers, both mental and bodily, which are inevitable when that unfoldingtakes place, as it threatens to do, in a hotbed of selfishness and all evilpassions. Man's mental and psychic growth will proceed in harmony with hismoral improvement, while his material surroundings will reflect the peaceand fraternal goodwill which will reign in his mind, instead of the discordand strife which is everywhere apparent around us today.Q. A truly delightful picture! But tell me, do you really expect all this tobe accomplished in one short century?A. Scarcely. But I must tell you that during the last quarter of everyhundred years an attempt is made by those \"Masters,\" of whom I have spoken,to help on the spiritual progress of Humanity in a marked and definite way.Towards the close of each century you will invariably find that anoutpouring or upheaval of spirituality-or call it mysticism if youprefer-has taken place. Some one or more persons have appeared in the worldas their agents, and a greater or less amount of occult knowledge andteaching has been given out. If you care to do so, you can trace thesemovements back, century by century, as far as our detailed historicalrecords extend.Q. But how does this bear on the future of the Theosophical Society?Page 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtA. If the present attempt, in the form of our Society, succeeds better thanits predecessors have done, then it will be in existence as an organized,living, and healthy body when the time comes for the effort of the twentiethcentury. The general condition of men's minds and hearts will have beenimproved and purified by the spread of its teachings, and, as I have said,their prejudices and dogmatic illusions will have been, to some extent atleast, removed. Not only so, but besides a large and accessible literatureready to men's hands, the next impulse will find a numerous and united bodyof people ready to welcome the new torch-bearer of Truth. He will find theminds of men prepared for his message, a language ready for him in which toclothe the new truths he brings, an organization awaiting his arrival, whichwill remove the merely mechanical, material obstacles and difficulties fromhis path. Think how much one, to whom such an opportunity is given, couldaccomplish. Measure it by comparison with what the Theosophical Societyactually has achieved in the last fourteen years, without any of theseadvantages and surrounded by hosts of hindrances which would not hamper thenew leader. Consider all this, and then tell me whether I am too sanguinewhen I say that if the Theosophical Society survives and lives true to itsmission, to its original impulses through the next hundred years-tell me, Isay, if I go too far in asserting that earth will be a heaven in thetwenty-first century in comparison with what it is now!  finisGlossaryAbsoluteness When predicated of the Universal Principle, it denotes anabstraction, which is more correct and logical than to apply the adjectiveabsolute to that which can have neither attributes nor limitations.Adam Kadmon (Heb.)Archetypal man, Humanity. The \"Heavenly man\" not fallen into sin. Cabalistsrefer it to the Ten Sephiroth on the plane of human perception.In the Cabala Adam Kadmon is the manifested Logos corresponding to our thirdLogos, the unmanifested being the first paradigmic ideal man, andsymbolizing the universe in abscondito, or in its \"privation\" in theAristotelian sense.The first Logos is \"the light of the World,\" the second, and the third, itsgradually deepening shadows.Adept (Lat. adeptus) In Occultism, one who has reached the stage ofinitiation and become a master in the Science of Esoteric Philosophy.Aether (Gr.)

Ain-Soph is also written En-Soph and Ain-Suph, for no one, noteven the Rabbis, are quite sure of their vowels. In the religiousmetaphysics of the old Hebrew philosophers, the One Principle was anabstraction like Parabrahman, though modern Cabalists have succeeded by meredint of sophistry and paradoxes in making a \"Supreme God\" of it, and nothinghigher. But with the early Chaldean Cabalists Ain-Soph was \"without form orbeing\" with \"no likeness with anything else.\" That Ain-Soph has never beenconsidered as the \"Creator\" is proved conclusively by the fact that such anorthodox Jew as Philo calls \"creator\" the Logos, who stands next the\"Limitless One,\" and is \"the Second God.\" \"The Second God is in its(Ain-Soph's) wisdom,\" says Philo in Quæst et Solut. Deity is no-thing; it isnameless, and therefore called Ain-Soph-the word Ain meaning nothing.Alchemy (Arabic Ul-Khemi) the chemistry of nature. Ul-Khemi or Al-Kimia,however, is really an Arabianized word, taken from the Greek 'chemeia' from'chumos': \"juice,\" extracted from a plant. Alchemy deals with the finerforces of nature and the various conditions of matter in which they arefound to operate. Seeking under the veil of language, more or lessartificial, to convey to the uninitiated so much of the Mysterium Magnum asis safe in the hands of a selfish world, the Alchemist postulates as hisfirst principle, the existence of a certain Universal Solvent in thehomogeneous substance from which the elements were evolved; which substancehe calls pure gold, or summum materiae. This solvent, also called menstruumuniversale, possesses the power of removing all the seeds of disease out ofthe human body, of renewing youth, and prolonging life. Such is the lapisphilosophorum (philosopher's stone). Alchemy first penetrated into Europethrough Geber, the great Arabian sage and philosopher, in the eighth centuryof our era; but it was known and practiced long ages ago in China and Egypt.Numerous papyri on Alchemy, and other proofs that it was the favorite studyof Kings and Priests, have been exhumed and preserved under the generic nameof Hermetic treatises. Alchemy is studied under three distinct aspects,which admit of many different interpretations, viz.: the Cosmic, the Human,and the Terrestrial.These three methods were typified under the three alchemicalproperties-sulphur, mercury, and salt. Different writers have stated thatthese are three, seven, ten, and twelve processes respectively; but they areall agreed there is but one object in Alchemy, which is to transmute grossmetals into pure gold. But what that gold really is, very few peopleunderstand correctly. No doubt there is such a thing in Nature astransmutation of the baser metal into the nobler; but this is only oneaspect of Alchemy, the terrestrial, or purely material, for we see logicallythe same process taking place in the bowels of the earth. Yet, besides andbeyond this interpretation, there is in Alchemy a symbolical meaning, purelypsychic and spiritual. While the Cabalist-Alchemist seeks for therealization of the former, the Occultist-Alchemist, spurning the gold of theearth, gives all his attention to and directs his efforts only towards thetransmutation of the baser quaternary into the divine upper trinity of man,which when finally blended, is one. The spiritual, mental, psychic, andphysical planes of human existence are in Alchemy compared to the fourelements-fire, air, water, and earth, and are each capable of a three-foldconstitution, i.e., fixed, unstable, and volatile. Little or nothing isknown by the world concerning the origin of this archaic branch ofphilosophy; but it is certain that it antedates the construction of anyknown Zodiac, and as dealing with the personified forces of nature, probablyalso any of the mythologies of the world. Nor is there any doubt that thetrue secrets of transmutation (on the physical plane) were known in the daysof old, and lost before the dawn of the so-called historical period. Modernchemistry owes its best fundamental discoveries to Alchemy, but regardlessof the undeniable truism of the latter, that there is but one element in theuniverse, chemistry placed metals in the class of elements, and is only nowbeginning to find out its gross mistake. Even some encyclopedists are forcedto confess that if most of the accounts of transmutation are fraud orPage 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtdelusion,... yet some of them are accompanied by testimony which renders them probable.By means of the galvanic battery even the alkalis have been discovered tohave a metallic basis. The possibility of obtaining metal from othersubstances which contain the ingredients composing it, of changing one metalinto another ... must therefore be left undecided. Nor are all Alchemists tobe considered impostors. Many have labored under the conviction of obtainingtheir object, with indefatigable patience and purity of heart, which issoundly recommended by Alchemists as the principal requisite for the successof their labors.Alexandrian School See Alexandrian Philosophers.Alexandrian Philosophers This famous school arose in Alexandria, Egypt,which city was for long ages the seat of learning and philosophy. It wasfamous for its library, founded by Ptolemy Soter at the very beginning ofhis reign-a library which once boasted 700,000 rolls, or volumes (AulusGellius), for its museum, the first real Academy of Sciences and Arts, forits world-renowned scholars, such as Euclid, the father of scientificgeometry; Apollonius of Perga, the author of the still-extant work on conicsections; Nicomachus, the arithmetician: for astronomers, naturalphilosophers, anatomists such as Herophilus and Erasistratus; physicians,musicians, artists, etc. But it became still more famous for its eclectic,or new Platonic school, founded by Ammonius Saccas in 173 ad, whosedisciples were Origen, Plotinus, and many other men now famous in history.The most celebrated schools of the Gnostics had their origin in Alexandria.Philo-Judaeus, Josephus, Iamblichus, Porphyry, Clement of Alexandria,Eratosthenes the astronomer, Hypatia, the virgin philosopher, and numberlessother stars of second magnitude, all belonged at various times to thesegreat schools, and helped to make of Alexandria one of the most justlyrenowned seats of learning that the world has ever produced.Altruism from Alter, other. A quality opposed to Egoism. Actions tending todo good to others, regardless of self.Ammonius Saccas A great and good philosopher who lived in Alexandria betweenthe second and third centuries of our Era, the founder of the Neo-PlatonicSchool of the Philaletheians or \"lovers of truth.\" He was of poor birth andborn of Christian parents, but endowed with such prominent, almost divinegoodness as to be called Theodidaktos, the \"God-taught.\" He honored thatwhich was good in Christianity, but broke with it and the Churches at anearly age, being unable to find in Christianity any superiority over the oldreligions.Analogeticists The disciples of Ammonius Saccas (see above) so calledbecause of their practice of interpreting all sacred legends, myths, andmysteries by a principle of analogy and correspondence, which rule is nowfound in the Cabalistic system, and preeminently so in the schools ofEsoteric philosophy in the East.Ananda (Sans.) Bliss, joy, felicity, happiness. A name of a favoritedisciple of Gautama, the Lord Buddha.Anaxagoras A famous Ionian philosopher, who lived 500 bc, studied philosophyunder Anaximenes of Miletus, and settled in the days of Pericles, at Athens.Socrates, Euripides, Archelaus, and other distinguished men and philosopherswere among his disciples and pupils. He was a most learned astronomer, andwas one of the first to explain openly that which was taught by Pythagorassecretly-viz., the movements of the planets, the eclipses of the sun andmoon, etc. It was he who taught the theory of chaos, on the principle that\"nothing comes from nothing,\" ex nihilo nihil fit-and of atoms, as theunderlying essence and substance of all bodies, \"of the same nature as thebodies which they formed.\" These atoms, he taught, were primarily put inPage 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtmotion by nous (universal intelligence, the Mahat of the Hindus), which nousis an immaterial, eternal, spiritual entity; by this combination the worldwas formed, the material gross bodies sinking down, and the ethereal atoms(or fiery ether) rising and spreading in the upper celestial regions.Antedating modern science by over 2,000 years, he taught that the stars wereof the same material as our earth, and the sun a glowing mass; that the moonwas a dark uninhabitable body, receiving its light from the sun; and beyondthe aforesaid science he confessed himself thoroughly convinced that thereal existence of things, perceived by our senses, could not be demonstrablyproved. He died in exile at Lampsacus, at the age of seventy-two.Anima Mundi (Lat.) The \"Soul of the World,\" the same as Alaya of theNorthern Buddhists; the divine Essence which pervades, permeates, animates,and informs all things, from the smallest atom of matter to man and god. Itis in a sense \"the seven-skinned Mother\" of the stanzas in The SecretDoctrine; the essence of seven planes of sentience, consciousness, anddifferentiation, both moral and physical. In its highest aspect it isNirvana; in its lowest, the Astral Light. It was feminine with the Gnostics,the early Christians, and the Nazarenes; bisexual with other sects, whoconsidered it only in its four lower planes, of igneous and ethereal naturein the objective world of forms, and divine and spiritual in its threehigher planes. When it is said that every human soul was born by detachingitself from the Anima Mundi, it is meant, esoterically, that our higher Egosare of an essence identical with It, and Mahat is a radiation of the everunknown Universal Absolute.Anoia (Gr.) is \"want of understanding,\" \"folly\"; and is the name applied byPlato and others to the lower Manas when too closely allied with Kama, whichis characterized by irrationality (agnoia). The Greek agnoia is evidently aderivative of the Sanskrit ajñana (phonetically agnyana), or ignorance,irrationality, and absence of knowledge.Anthropomorphism From the Greek Anthropos, man.

It is called the Pythian Apollo, as the god isrepresented in the moment of his victory over the serpent Python. The statuewas found in the ruins of Antium in 1503.Apollonius of Tyana A wonderful philosopher born in Cappadocia about thebeginning of the first century; an ardent Pythagorean, who studied thePhoenician sciences under Euthydemus, and Pythagorean philosophy and othersubjects under Euxenus of Heraclea. According to the tenets of thePythagorean school he remained a vegetarian the whole of his long life, ateonly fruit and herbs, drank no wine, wore vestments made only of plantfibers, walked barefooted and let his hair grow to the full length, as allthe Initiates have done before and after him. He was initiated by thepriests of the temple of Aesculapius (Asclepios) at Aegae, and learnt manyof the \"miracles\" for healing the sick wrought by the God of medicine.Having prepared himself for a higher initiation by a silence of five years,and by travel-visiting Antioch, Ephesus, and Pamphylia and other parts-herepaired via Babylon to India, alone, all his disciples having abandoned himas they feared to go to the \"land of enchantments.\" A casual disciple,Damis, whom he met on his way, accompanied him, however, on his travels. AtBabylon he got initiated by the Chaldeans and Magi, according to Damis,whose narrative was copied by one named Philostratus one hundred yearslater. After his return from India, he showed himself a true Initiate inthat the pestilence, earthquakes, deaths of kings, and other events, whichhe prophesied, duly happened.Page 144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtAt Lesbos, the priests of Orpheus got jealous of him, and refused toinitiate him into their peculiar mysteries, though they did so several yearslater. He preached to the people of Athens and other States the purest andnoblest ethics, and the phenomena he produced were as wonderful as they werenumerous, and well authenticated. \"How is it,\" inquires Justin Martyr, indismay,How is it that the talismans (telesmata) of Apollonius have power, for theyprevent, as we see, the fury of the waves, and the violence of the winds,and the attacks of wild beasts; and whilst our Lord's miracles are preservedby tradition alone, those of Apollonius are most numerous, and actuallymanifested in present facts?But an answer is easily found to this, in the fact that, after crossing theHindu Koosh, Apollonius had been directed by a king to the abode of theSages, whose abode it may be to this day, and who taught him theirunsurpassed knowledge. His dialogues, with the Corinthian Menippus, give tous truly the esoteric catechism, and disclose (when understood) many animportant mystery of nature. Apollonius was the friend, correspondent, andguest of kings and queens, and no wonderful or \"magic\" powers are betterattested than his. Towards the close of his long and wonderful life heopened an esoteric school at Ephesus, and died at the ripe old age of onehundred years.Archangel Highest, supreme angel. From the two Greek words, arch, \"first,\"and angelos, \"messenger.\"Arhat (Sans.) also pronounced and written Arahat, Arhan, Rahat, etc., \"theworthy one,\" a perfected Aryan, one exempt from reincarnation, \"deservingDivine honors.\" This was the name first given to the Jain, and subsequentlyto the Buddhist holy men initiated into the esoteric mysteries. The Arhat isone who has entered the last and highest path, and is thus emancipated fromrebirth.Arians The followers of Arius, a presbyter of the Church in Alexandria inthe fourth century. One who holds that Christ is a created and human being,inferior to God the Father, though a grand and noble man, a true adept,versed in all the divine mysteries.Aristobulus An Alexandrian writer, and an obscure philosopher. A Jew whotried to prove that Aristotle explained the esoteric thoughts of Moses.Aryan (Sans.) Lit., \"the holy\"; those who had mastered the aryasatyani andentered the aryamarga path to Nirvana or Moksha, the great \"fourfold\" path.They were originally known as ishis. But now the name has become the epithetof a race, and our Orientalists, depriving the Hindu Brahmins of theirbirthright, have made ryans of all Europeans. Since, in esotericism, thefour paths or stages can only be entered through great spiritual developmentand \"growth in holiness,\" they are called the aryamarga. The degrees ofArhatship, called respectively Srotapatti, Sakridagamin, Anagamin, andArhat, or the four classes of aryas, correspond to the four paths andtruths.Aspect The form (Rupa) under which any principle in septenary man or naturemanifests is called an aspect of that principle in Theosophy.Astral Body The ethereal counterpart or double of any physicalbody-Doppelgänger.Astrology The science which defines the action of celestial bodies uponmundane affairs, and claims to foretell future events from the positions ofthe stars.

Claudius Ptolemy, the famous geographer andmathematician who founded the system of Astronomy known under his name,wrote his Tetrabiblos, which is still the basis of modern Astrology, in 135ad. The science of Horoscopy is studied now chiefly under four heads, viz.:1. Mundane, in its application to meteorology, seismology, husbandry.2.

Genethliacal in connection with the future of individuals from birth untodeath.The Egyptians and the Chaldeans were among the most ancient votaries ofAstrology, though their modes of reading the stars and the modern methodsdiffer considerably. The former claimed that Belus, the Bel or Elu of theChaldeans, a scion of the Divine Dynasty, or the dynasty of the King-gods,had belonged to the land of Chemi, and had left it to found a colony fromEgypt on the banks of the Euphrates, where a temple, ministered by priestsin the service of the \"lords of the stars,\" was built. As to the origin ofthe science, it is known on the one hand that Thebes claimed the honor ofthe invention of Astrology; whereas, on the other hand, all are agreed thatit was the Chaldeans who taught that science to the other nations. NowThebes antedated considerably, not only \"Ur of the Chaldeans,\" but alsoNipur, where Bel was first worshipped-Sin, his son (the moon), being thepresiding deity of Ur, the land of the nativity of Terah, the Sabean andAstrolater, and of Abram, his son, the great Astrologer of Biblicaltradition. All tends, therefore, to corroborate the Egyptian claim. If lateron the name of Astrologer fell into disrepute in Rome and elsewhere, it wasowing to the frauds of those who wanted to make money of that which was partand parcel of the Sacred Science of the Mysteries, and who, ignorant of thelatter, evolved a system based entirely on mathematics, instead oftranscendental metaphysics with the physical celestial bodies as its Upadhior material basis. Yet, all persecutions notwithstanding, the number ofadherents to Astrology among the most intellectual and scientific minds wasalways very great. If Cardan and Kepler were among its ardent supporters,then later votaries have nothing to blush for, even in its now imperfect anddistorted form. As said in Isis:Astrology is to exact astronomy, what psychology is to exact physiology. Inastrology and psychology one has to step beyond the visible world of matterand enter into the domain of transcendent spirit.Athenagoras A Platonic Philosopher of Athens, who wrote an apology for theChristians in 177 ad, addressed to Marcus Aurelius, to prove that theaccusations brought against them, viz., that they were incestuous and atemurdered children, were untrue.Atma (Sans.) The Universal Spirit, the divine monad, \"the seventhPrinciple,\" so called, in the exoteric \"septenary\" classification of man.The Supreme Soul.Aura (Gr. and Lat.) A fine, delicate invisible essence or fluid thatemanates from human, animal, and other bodies. It is a psychic effluviumpartaking of both the mind and the body, as there is both an electro-vitaland at the same time an electro-mental aura; called in Theosophy the akashicor magnetic aura. In R.C. Martyrology, a Saint.Avatara (Sans.) Divine incarnation. The descent of a god or some exaltedPage 146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtBeing who has progressed beyond the necessity for rebirth, into the body ofa simple mortal. Krishna was an Avatara of Vishnu. The Dalai-Lama isregarded as an Avatara of Avalokitesvara and the Tashi-Lama as one ofTson-kha-pa, or Amitabha. These are two kinds of Avataras: one born fromwoman and the other \"parentless,\" Anupapadaka.Beness A term coined by Theosophists to render more accurately the essentialmeaning of the untranslatable word Sat. The latter word does not mean Being,for the term Being presupposes a sentient consciousness of existence. But asthe term Sat is applied solely to the absolute principle, that universal,unknown, and ever unknowable principle which philosophical Pantheismpostulates, calling it the basic root of Kosmos and Kosmos itself, it couldnot be translated by the simple term Being. Sat, indeed, is not even, astranslated by some Orientalists, \"the incomprehensible Entity,\" for it is nomore an \"Entity\" than a non-entity, but both. It is as said absoluteBeness-not \"Being\"-the one, secondless, undivided and indivisible All-theroot of nature both visible and invisible, objective and subjective,comprehensible and-never to be fully comprehended.Bhagavad-Gita (Sans.) Lit., \"the Lord's Song,\" a portion of The Mahabharata,the great epic poem of India. It contains a dialogue wherein Krisha (the\"Charioteer\") and Arjuna (his Chela) have a discussion upon the highestspiritual philosophy. The work is preeminently occult or esoteric.Black Magic Sorcery; necromancy, or the raising of the dead and otherselfish abuses of abnormal powers. This abuse may be unintentional; still ithas to remain \"black\" magic whenever anything is produced phenomenallysimply for one's own gratification.Böhme, Jacob A mystic and great philosopher, one of the most prominentTheosophists of the medieval ages. He was born about 1575 at Old Diedenberg,some two miles from Görlitz (Silesia), and died in 1624, being nearly fiftyyears old. When a boy he was a common shepherd, and, after learning to readand write in a village school, became an apprentice to a poor shoemaker atGörlitz. He was a natural clairvoyant of the most wonderful power. With noeducation or acquaintance with science he wrote works which are now provedto be full of scientific truths; but these, as he himself says of what hewrote, he \"saw as in a Great Deep in the Eternal.\" He had \"a thorough viewof the universe, as in chaos,\" which yet opened itself in him, from time totime, \"as in a young planet,\" he says. He was a thorough born mystic, andevidently of a constitution which is most rare; one of those fine natureswhose material envelope impedes in no way the direct, even if onlyoccasional, intercommunication between the intellectual and spiritual Ego.It is this Ego which Jacob Böhme, as so many other untrained mystics,mistook for God. \"Man must acknowledge,\" he writes, \"that his knowledge isnot his own, but from God, who manifests the Ideas of Wisdom to the Soul ofMan in what measure he pleases.\" Had this great Theosophist been born 300years later he might have expressed it otherwise. He would have known thatthe \"God\" who spoke through his poor uncultured and untrained brain was hisown Divine Ego, the omniscient Deity within himself, and that what thatDeity gave out was not \"what measure he pleased,\" but in the measure of thecapacities of the mortal and temporary dwelling it informed.Book of the Keys An ancient Cabalistic work. The original is no longerextant, though there may be spurious and disfigured copies and forgeries ofit.Brahma (Sans.) The student must distinguish between the neuter Brahma, andthe male Creator of the Indian Pantheon, Brahmâ . The former Brahma orBrahman is the impersonal, Supreme, and uncognizable Soul of the Universe,from the essence of which all emanates, and into which all returns; which isincorporeal, immaterial, unborn, eternal, beginningless, and endless. It isall-pervading, animating the highest god as well as the smallest mineralatom. Brahmâ, on the other hand, the male and the alleged Creator, exists inPage 147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txthis manifestation periodically only, and passes into pralaya, i.e.,disappears and is annihilated as periodically. (see below)Brahmâ's Day A period of 2,160,000,000 years, during which Brahmâ, havingemerged out of his Golden Egg (Hiranyagarbha), creates and fashions thematerial world (for he is simply the fertilizing and creative force inNature). After this period the worlds being destroyed in turn by fire andwater, he vanishes with objective nature; and then comes the Night of Brahmâ(see below).Brahmâ's Night A period of equal duration to Brahmâ's Day, in which Brahmâis said to be asleep. Upon awakening he recommences the process, and thisgoes on for an age of Brahmâ composed of alternate \"Days\" and \"Nights,\" andlasting for 100 years of 2,160,000,000 each. It requires fifteen figures toexpress the duration of such an age, after the expiration of which theMaha-Pralaya or Great Dissolution sets in, and lasts in its turn for thesame space of fifteen figures.Brahma-Vidya (Sans.) The knowledge or Esoteric Science about the true natureof Brahma and Brahmâ.Buddha (Sans.) \"The enlightened.\" Generally known as the title of GautamaBuddha, the Prince of Kapilavastu, the founder of modern Buddhism. Thehighest degree of knowledge and holiness. To become a Buddha one has tobreak through the bondage of sense and personality; to acquire a completeperception of the real Self, and learn not to separate it from all the otherSelves; to learn by experience the utter unreality of all phenomena,foremost of all the visible Kosmos; to attain a complete detachment from allthat is evanescent and finite, and to live while yet on earth only in theimmortal and everlasting.Buddhi (Sans.) Universal Soul or Mind. Maha -Buddhi is a name of Mahat; alsothe Spiritual Soul in man (the sixth principle exoterically), the vehicle ofatma, the seventh, according to the exoteric enumeration.Buddhism the religious philosophy taught by Gautama Buddha. It is now splitinto two distinct churches: the Southern and Northern. The former is said tobe the purer, as having preserved more religiously the original teachings ofthe Lord Buddha. The Northern Buddhism is confined to Tibet, China, andNepal. But this distinction is incorrect. If the Southern Church is nearer,and has not, in fact, departed, except perhaps in trifling dogmas, due tothe many councils held after the death of the Master, from the public orexoteric teachings of Sakyamuni, the Northern Church is the outcome ofSiddhartha Buddha's esoteric teachings which he confined to his electBhikshus and Arhats. Buddhism, in fact, cannot be justly judged in our ageeither by one or the other of its exoteric popular forms. Real Buddhism canbe appreciated only by blending the philosophy of the Southern Church andthe metaphysics of the Northern Schools. If one seems too iconoclastic andstern, and the other too metaphysical and transcendental, events beingovercharged with the weeds of Indian exotericism-many of the gods of itsPantheon having been transplanted under new names into Tibetan soil-it isdue to the popular expression of Buddhism in both churches.Correspondentially, they stand in their relation to each other asProtestantism to Roman Catholicism. Both err by an excess of zeal anderroneous interpretations, though neither the Southern nor the NorthernBuddhist clergy have ever departed from Truth consciously, still less havethey acted under the dictates of priestocracy, ambition, or an eye topersonal gain and power, as the later churches have.Buddhi-Taijas (Sans.) A very mystic term, capable of severalinterpretations. In Occultism, however, and in relation to the humanprinciples (exoterically), it is a term to express the state of our dualManas, when, reunited during a man's life, it bathes in the radiance ofBuddhi, the Spiritual Soul. For Taijas means the radiant, and Manas,Page 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtbecoming radiant in consequence of its union with Buddhi, and being, so tospeak, merged into it, is identified with the latter; the trinity has becomeone; and, as the element of Buddhi is the highest, it becomes Buddhi-Taijas. In short, it is the human soul illuminated by the radiance of the divinesoul, the human reason lit by the light of the Spirit or DivineSelf-Consciousness.Cabala (Heb.)The hidden wisdom of the Hebrew Rabbis of the middle ages derived from theolder secret doctrines concerning divine things and cosmogony, which werecombined into a theology after the time of the captivity of the Jews inBabylon.All the works that fall under the esoteric category are termed Cabalistic.Caste Originally the system of the four hereditary classes into which Indianpopulation was divided: Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya, and Sudra-(a)descendant of Brahmâ; (b) warrior; (c) mercantile, and (d) the lowest oragricultural Sudra class. From these four, hundreds of divisions and minorcastes have sprung.Causal Body This \"body,\" which is in reality no body at all, eitherobjective or subjective, but Buddhi the Spiritual Soul, is so-called becauseit is the direct cause of the Sushupti state leading to the Turiya state,the highest state of Samadhi. It is called Karanopadhi, \"the basis of thecause,\" by the \"Taraka Raja\" Yogis, and in the Vedanta System corresponds toboth the Vijñanamaya and Anandamayakosha (the latter coming next to Atma,and therefore being the vehicle of the Universal Spirit). Buddhi alone couldnot be called a \"Causal body,\" but becomes one in conjunction with Manas,the incarnating Entity or Ego.Chela (Sans.) A disciple. The pupil of a Guru or Sage, the follower of someAdept, or a school of philosophy.Chréstos (Gr.) The early gnostic term for Christ. This technical term wasused in the fifth century bc by Aeschylus, Herodotus and others. TheManteumata pythocresta, or the \"Oracles delivered by a Pythian God\" througha pythoness, are mentioned by the former (Cho. 901), and Pythocréstos isderived from chrao. Chrésterion is not only \"the test of an oracle,\" but anoffering to, or for, the oracle. Chréstes is one who explains oracles, a\"prophet and soothsayer,\" and Chrésterios, one who serves an oracle or aGod. The earliest Christian writer, Justin Martyr, in his first Apology,calls his coreligionists Chréstians. \"It is only through ignorance that mencall themselves Christians, instead of Chréstians,\" says Lactantius Theterms Christ and Christians, spelt originally Chrést and Chréstians, wereborrowed from the Temple vocabulary of the Pagans. Chréstos meant, in thatvocabulary, \"a disciple on probation,\" a candidate for hierophantship; who,when he had attained it, through Initiation, long trials and suffering, andhad been anointed (i.e., \"rubbed with oil,\" as Initiates and even Idols ofthe Gods were, as the last touch of ritualistic observance), was changedinto Christos-the \"purified\" in esoteric or mystery language. In mysticsymbology, indeed, Christes or Christos meant that the \"way,\" the Path, wasalready trodden and the goal reached; when the fruits of the arduous labor,uniting the personality of evanescent clay with the indestructibleIndividuality, transformed it thereby into the immortal Ego. \"At the end ofthe way stands the Christes,\" the Purifier; and the union once accomplished,the Chréstos, the \"man of sorrow\" became Christos himself. Paul, theInitiate, knew this, and meant this precisely, when he is made to say in badtranslation, \"I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,\" thetrue rendering of which is, \"... until you form the Christos withinyourselves.\" But the profane, who knew only that Chréstos was in some wayconnected with priest and prophet, and knew nothing about the hidden meaningof Christos, insisted, as did Lactantius and Justin Martyr, on being calledPage 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtChréstians instead of Christians. Every good individual, therefore, may findChrist in his \"inner man,\" as Paul expresses it, whether he be Jew, Muslim,Hindu, or Christian.Christ See Chréstos.Christian Scientist A newly-coined term for denoting the practitioners of ahealing art by will. The name is a misnomer, since Buddhist or Jew, Hindu orMaterialist can practice this new form of Western Yoga with like success ifhe can only guide and control his will with sufficient firmness. \"MentalScientists\" is another rival school. These work by a universal denial ofevery disease and evil imaginable, and claim, syllogistically, that sinceUniversal Spirit cannot be subject to the ailing of flesh, and since everyatom is Spirit and in Spirit, and since, finally, they-the healers and thehealed-are all absorbed in this Spirit or Deity, there is not, nor can therebe, such a thing as disease. This prevents in nowise both Christian andMental Scientists from succumbing to disease and nursing chronic diseasesfor years in their own bodies just like other ordinary mortals.Clairaudience The faculty-whether innate or acquired by occult training-tohear things at whatever distance.Clairvoyance A faculty of seeing with the inner eye or spiritual sight. Asnow used, it is a loose and flippant term, embracing under its meaning botha happy guess due to natural shrewdness or intuition, and also that facultywhich was so remarkably exercised by Jacob Böhme and Swedenborg. Yet eventhese two great seers, since they could never rise superior to the generalspirit of the Jewish Bible and Sectarian teachings, have sadly confused whatthey saw, and fallen far short of true clairvoyance.Clemens Alexandrinus A Church Father and voluminous writer, who had been aNeo-Platonist and a disciple of Ammonius Saccas. He was one of the fewChristian philosophers between the second and third centuries of our era, atAlexandria.College of Rabbis A college at Babylon; most famous during the earlycenturies of Christianity, but its glory was greatly darkened by theappearance in Alexandria of Hellenic teachers, such as Philo-Judaeus,Josephus, Aristobulus, and others. The former avenged themselves on theirsuccessful rivals by speaking of the Alexandrians as Theurgists and uncleanprophets. But the Alexandrian believers in thaumaturgy were not regarded assinners and impostors when orthodox Jews were at the head of such schools of\"hazim.\" There were colleges for teaching prophecy and occult sciences.Samuel was the chief of such a college at Ramah; Elisha, at Jericho. Hillelhad a regular academy for prophets and seers; and it is Hillel, a pupil ofthe Babylonian College, who was the founder of the sect of the Pharisees andthe great orthodox Rabbis.Cycle (Gr. Kuklos) The ancients divided time into endless cycles, wheelswithin wheels, all such periods being of various durations, and each markingthe beginning or end of some event either cosmic, mundane, physical, ormetaphysical. There were cycles of only a few years, and cycles of immenseduration, the great Orphic cycle referring to the ethnological change ofraces lasting 120,000 years, and that of Cassandrus of 136,000, whichbrought about a complete change in planetary influences and theircorrelations between men and gods-a fact entirely lost sight of by modernastrologers.Deist One who admits the possibility of the existence of a God or gods, butclaims to know nothing of either, and denies revelation. An agnostic ofolden times.Deva (Sans.) A god, a \"resplendent\" Deity, Deva-Deus, from the root div, \"toshine.\" A Deva is a celestial being-whether good, bad or indifferent-whichPage 150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtinhabits \"the three worlds,\" or the three planes above us. There are 33groups or millions of them.Devachan (Sans.) The \"Dwelling of the Gods.\" A state intermediate betweentwo earth-lives, and into which the Ego ( Atma-Buddhi-Manas, or the Trinitymade one) enters after its separation from Kamarupa, and the disintegrationof the lower principles, after the death of the body, on Earth.Dhammapada (Sans.) A work containing various aphorisms from the BuddhistScriptures.Dhyana (Sans.) One of the six Paramitas of perfection. A state ofabstraction which carries the ascetic practicing it far above the region ofsensuous perception, and out of the world of matter. Lit., contemplation.The six stages of Dhyani differ only in the degrees of abstraction of thepersonal Ego from sensuous life.Dhyani-Chohans (Sans.) Lit., \"The Lords of Light.\" The highest gods,answering to the Roman Catholic Archangels. The divine Intelligences chargedwith the supervision of Kosmos.Double The same as the Astral body or \"Doppelgänger.\"Ecstasis (Gr.) A psycho-spiritual state; a physical trance which inducesclairvoyance, and a beatific state which brings on visions.Ego (Lat.) \"I\"; the consciousness in man of the \"I am I,\" or the feeling ofI-am-ship. Esoteric philosophy teaches the existence of two Egos in man, themortal or personal, and the higher, the divine or impersonal, calling theformer \"personality,\" and the latter \"individuality.\"Egoity (from the word Ego). Egoity means \"individuality\"-never\"personality,\" as it is the opposite of Egoism or \"selfishness,\" thecharacteristic par excellence of the latter.Eidolon (Gr.) The same as that which we term the human phantom, the Astralform.Elementals (Spirits of the Elements) The creatures evolved in the FourKingdoms, or Elements-Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. They are called by theCabalists, Gnomes (of the Earth), Sylphs (of the Air), Salamanders (of theFire), and Undines (of the Water), except a few of the higher kinds andtheir rulers. They are rather the forces of nature than ethereal men andwomen. These forces, as the servile agents of the occultist, may producevarious effects; but if employed by elementaries (Kamarupas)-in which casethey enslave the mediums-they will deceive. All the lower invisible beingsgenerated on the fifth, sixth, and seventh Planes of our terrestrialatmosphere are called Elementals-Peris, Devs, Djins, Sylvans, Satyrs, Fauns,Elves, Dwarfs, Trolls, Norns, Kobolds, Brownies, Nixies, Goblins, Pinkies,Banshees, Moss People, White Ladies, Spooks, Fairies, etc., etc.Eleusinia (Gr.) The Eleusinian Mysteries were the most famous and the mostancient of all the Greek mysteries (save the Samothracian), and wereperformed near the hamlet of Eleusis, not far from Athens. Epiphanius tracesthem to the days of Iacchos (1800 bc) They were held in honor of Demeter,the great Ceres, and the Egyptian Isis; and the last act of the performancereferred to a sacrificial victim of atonement and a resurrection, when theInitiate was admitted to the highest degree of Epopt. The festival of theMysteries began in the month of Boëdromion (September), the time ofgrape-gathering, and lasted from the 15th to the 22nd-seven days. The HebrewFeast of Tabernacles-the feast of ingatherings-in the month of Ethanim (theseventh) also began on the 15th and ended on the 22nd of that month. Thename of the month (Ethanim) is derived, according to some, from Adonim,Adonia, Attenim, Ethanim, and was in honor of Adonai, or Adonis (Tham),Page 151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtwhose death was lamented by the Hebrews in the groves of Bethlehem. Thesacrifice of \"Bread and Wine\" was performed both in the Eleusinia and duringthe Feast of Tabernacles.Emanation (the doctrine of) is in its metaphysical meaning opposed toevolution, yet one with it. Science teaches that, physiologically, evolutionis a mode of generation in which the germ that develops the fetus preexistsalready in the parent, the development and final form and characteristics ofthat germ being accomplished by nature; and that (as in its cosmology) theprocess takes place blindly, through the correlation of the elements andtheir various compounds. Occultism teaches that this is only the apparentmode, the real process being Emanation, guided by intelligent forces underan immutable Law. Therefore, while the Occultists and Theosophists believethoroughly in the doctrine of Evolution as given out by Kapila and Manu,they are Emanationists rather than Evolutionists. The doctrine of Emanationwas at one time universal. It was taught by the Alexandrian, as well as bythe Indian philosophers, by the Egyptian, the Chaldean, and HellenicHierophants, and also by the Hebrews (in their Cabala, and even in Genesis).For it is only owing to deliberate mistranslation that the Hebrew word asdtwas translated \"angels\" from the Septuagint, while it means Emanations,Aeons, just as with the Gnostics. Indeed, in Deuteronomy the word asdt orashdt is translated as \"fiery law,\" whilst the correct rendering of thepassage should be, \"from his right went (not a fiery law, but) a fireaccording to law,\" viz., that the fire of one flame is imparted to andcaught up by another-like as in a trail of inflammable substance. This isprecisely Emanation, as shown in Isis Unveiled.In Evolution, as it is now beginning to be understood, there is supposed tobe in all matter an impulse to take on a higher form-a supposition clearlyexpressed by Manu and other Hindu philosophers of the highest antiquity. Thephilosopher's tree illustrates it in the case of the zinc solution. Thecontroversy between the followers of this school and the Emanationists maybe briefly stated thus: The Evolutionist stops all inquiry at the borders of\"the unknowable.\" The Emanationist believes that nothing can be evolved-or,as the word means, unwombed or born-except it has first been involved, thusindicating that life is from a spiritual potency above the whole.Esoteric Hidden, secret. From the Greek Esotericos-\"inner,\" concealed.Esoteric Bodhism Secret wisdom or intelligence, from the Greek Esotericos,\"inner,\" and the Sanskrit Bodhi, \"knowledge,\" in contradistinction toBuddhi, \"the faculty of knowledge or intelligence,\" and Buddhism, thephilosophy or Law of Buddha (the Enlightened). Also written \"Budhism,\" fromBudha (Intelligence, Wisdom) the Son of Soma.Exoteric (Gr.) Outward, public; the opposite of esoteric or hidden.Extra-Cosmic Outside of Kosmos or Nature. A nonsensical word invented toassert the existence of a personal god independent of or outside Nature perse; for as Nature, or the Universe, is infinite and limitless there can benothing outside it. The term is coined in opposition to the Pantheistic ideathat the whole Kosmos is animated or informed with the Spirit of Deity,Nature being but the garment, and matter the illusive shadows, of the realunseen Presence.Eurasians An abbreviation of \"European-Asians.\" The mixed colored races; thechildren of the white fathers, and the dark mothers of India, and viceversa.Ferho (Gnostic). The highest and greatest creative power with the NazareneGnostics (Codex Nazaraeus).Fire-Philosophers The name given to the Hermetists and Alchemists of theMiddle Ages, and also to the Rosicrucians. The latter, the successors ofPage 152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtTheurgists, regarded fire as the symbol of Deity. It was the source, notonly of material atoms, but the container of the Spiritual and PsychicForces energizing them. Broadly analyzed, Fire is a triple principle;esoterically, a septenary, as are all the rest of the elements. As man iscomposed of Spirit, Soul, and Body, plus a fourfold aspect; so is Fire. Asin the works of Robert Flood (de Fluctibus), one of the famous Rosicrucians,fire contains-Firstly, a visible flame (body); secondly, an invisible,astral fire (soul); and thirdly, spirit. The four aspects are (a) heat(life), (b) light (mind), (c) electricity (Kamic or molecular powers), and(d) the synthetic essences, beyond spirit, or the radical cause of itsexistence and manifestation. For the Hermetist or Rosicrucian, when a flameis extinct on the objective plane, it has only passed from the seen worldinto the unseen; from the knowable into the unknowable.Gautama (Sans.) A name in India. It is that of the Prince of Kapilavastu,son of Sudhodana, the Sâkya King of a small territory on the borders ofNepal, born in the seventh century bc, now called the \"Savior of the world.\"Gautama or Gotama was the sacerdotal name of the Sâkya family. Born a simplemortal, he rose to Buddhaship through his own personal and unaided merit; aman-verily greater than any God!Gebirol Salomon Ben Jehudah, called in literature Avicebron. An Israelite bybirth, a philosopher, poet, and Cabalist; a voluminous writer and a mystic.He was born in the eleventh century at Malaga (1021), educated at Saragossa,and died at Valencia in 1070, murdered by a Mohammedan. Hisfellow-religionists called him Salomon, the Sephardi, or the Spaniard, andthe Arabs, Abu Ayyub Suleiman-ben ya'hya Ibn Dgebirol, whilst theScholastics named him Avicebron (see Myers' Quabbalah). Ibn Gebirol wascertainly one of the greatest philosophers and scholars of his age. He wrotemuch in Arabic, and most of his manuscript have been preserved. His greatestwork appears to be The Megôr Hayyim, i.e., The Fountain of Life, \"one of theearliest exposures of the secrets of the Speculative Cabala,\" as hisbiographer informs us.Gnosis (Gr.) Lit. \"knowledge.\" The technical term used by the schools ofreligious philosophy, both before and during the first centuries ofso-called Christianity, to denote the object of their enquiry. Thisspiritual and sacred knowledge, the Gupta-Vidya of the Hindus, could only beobtained by Initiation into Spiritual Mysteries of which the ceremonial\"Mysteries\" were a type.Gnostics (Gr.) The philosophers who formulated and taught the \"Gnosis\" orknowledge. They flourished in the first three centuries of the ChristianEra. The following were eminent: Valentinus, Basilides, Marcion, SimonMagus, etc.Golden Age The ancients divided the life cycle into the Golden, Silver,Bronze, and Iron Ages. The Golden was an age of primeval purity, simplicity,and general happiness.Great Age There were several \"Great Ages\" mentioned by the ancients. InIndia it embraced the whole Maha-Manvantara the \"Age of Brahmâ ,\" each \"Day\"of which represents the Life Cycle of a chain, i.e., it embraces a period ofSeven Rounds. Thus while a \"Day\" and a \"Night\" represent, as Manvantara andPralaya, 8,640,000,000 years, an \"age\" lasts through a period of311,040,000,000,000; after which the Pralaya or dissolution of the universebecomes universal. With the Egyptian and Greeks the \"Great Age\" referredonly to the Tropical, or Sidereal year, the duration of which is 25,868solar years. Of the complete age-that of the Gods-they said nothing, as itwas a matter to be discussed and divulged only at the Mysteries, and duringthe Initiation Ceremonies. The \"Great Age\" of the Chaldeans was the same infigures as that of the Hindus.Guhya-Vidya (Sans.) The secret knowledge of mystic-mantras.Page 153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtGupta-Vidya (Sans.) The same as Guhya-Vidya . Esoteric or secret science,knowledge.Gyges \"The ring of Gyges\" has become a familiar metaphor in Europeanliterature. Gyges was a Lydian, who, after murdering the King Candaules,married his widow. Plato tells us that Gyges descending once into a chasm ofthe earth, discovered a brazen horse, within whose opened side was theskeleton of a man of gigantic stature, who had a brazen ring on his finger.This ring when placed on his own finger made him invisible.Hades (Gr.), or Aides, the \"invisible,\" the land of shadows; one of whoseregions was Tartarus, a place of complete darkness, as was also the regionof profound dreamless sleep in Amenti. Judging by the allegoricaldescription of the punishments inflicted therein, the place was purelyKarmic. Neither Hades nor Amenti were the Hell still preached by someretrograde priests and clergymen; and whether represented by the ElysianFields or by Tartarus, they could only be reached by crossing the river tothe \"other shore.\" As well expressed in the \"Egyptian Belief,\" the story ofCharon, the ferryman (of the Styx) is to be found not only in Homer, but inthe poetry of many lands. The River must be crossed before gaining the Islesof the Blest. The Ritual of Egypt described a Charon and his boat long agesbefore Homer. He is Khu-en-na, \"the hawk-headed steersman.\" (See Hell.)Hallucinations A state produced sometimes by physiological disorders,sometimes by mediumship, and at others by drunkenness. But the cause thatproduces the visions has to be sought deeper than physiology. All such,particularly when produced through mediumship, are preceded by a relaxationof the nervous system, generating invariably an abnormal magnetic conditionwhich attracts to the sufferer waves of astral light. It is these latterthat furnish the various hallucinations, which, however, are not always, asphysicians would explain them, mere empty and unreal dreams. No one can seethat which does not exist-i.e., which is not impressed-in or on the astralwaves. But a seer may perceive objects and scenes (whether past, present, orfuture) which have no relation whatever to himself; and perceive, moreover,several things entirely disconnected with each other at one and the sametime, so as to produce the most grotesque and absurd combinations. Butdrunkard and seer, medium and adept see their respective visions in theastral light; only while the drunkard, the madman, and the untrained medium,or one in a brain fever, see, because they cannot help it, and evoke jumbledvisions unconsciously to themselves without being able to control them, theadept and the trained Seer have the choice and the control of such visions.They know where to fix their gaze, how to steady the scenes they wish toobserve, and how to see beyond the upper outward layers of the astral light.With the former such glimpses into the waves are hallucinations; with thelatter they become the faithful reproduction of what actually has been, is,or will be taking place. The glimpses at random, caught by the medium, andhis flickering visions in the deceptive light, are transformed under theguiding will of the adept and seer into steady pictures, the truthfulrepresentation of that which he wills to come within the focus of hisperception.Hell A term which the Anglo-Saxon race has evidently derived from the nameof the Scandinavian goddess, Hela, just as the word ad, in Russian and otherSlavonian tongues expressing the same conception, is derived from the GreekHades, the only difference between the Scandinavian cold Hell, and the hotHell of the Christians, being found in their respective temperatures. Buteven the idea of these overheated regions is not original with theEuropeans, many people having entertained the conception of an underworldclimate; as well we may, if we localize our Hell in the center of the earth.All exoteric religions-the creeds of the Brahmins, Buddhists, Zoroastrians,Mohammedans, Jews, and the rest, made their Hells hot and dark, though manywere more attractive than frightful. The idea of a hot Hell is anafterthought, the distortion of an astronomical allegory. With the EgyptiansPage 154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtHell became a place of punishment by fire not earlier than the 17th or 18thDynasty, when Typhon was transformed from a God into a Devil. But atwhatever time they implanted this dread superstition in the minds of thepoor ignorant masses, the scheme of a burning Hell and souls tormentedtherein is purely Egyptian. Ra (the Sun) became the Lord of the Furnace, inKarr, the Hell of the Pharaohs, and the sinner was threatened with misery\"in the heat of infernal fires.\" \"A lion was there,\" says Dr. Birch, \"andwas called the roaring monster.\" Another describes the place as \"thebottomless pit and lake of fire, into which the victims are thrown\" (compareRevelation). The Hebrew word gaï-hinnom (gehena) had never really thesignificance given to it in Christian orthodoxy.Hermas An ancient Greek writer, of whose works only a few fragments nowremain extant.Hierogrammatists (Gr.) The title given to those Egyptian priests who wereentrusted with the writing and reading of the sacred and secret records. The\"scribes of the secret records\" literally. They were the instructors of theneophytes preparing for initiation.Hierophant From the Greek Hierophantes, literally \"he who explains sacredthings,\" a title belonging to the highest adepts in the temples ofantiquity, who were the teachers and expounders of the Mysteries, and theInitiators into the final great Mysteries. The Hierophant stood for theDemiurge, and explained to the postulants for Initiation the variousphenomena of creation that were produced for their tuition.He was the sole expounder of the exoteric secrets and doctrines. It wasforbidden even to pronounce his name before an uninitiated person. He sat inthe East, and wore as symbol of authority, a golden globe, suspended fromthe neck. He was also called Mystagogus.Hillel A great Babylonian Rabbi of the century preceding the Christian Era.He was the founder of the sect of the Pharisees, a learned and a saintlyman.Hinayana (Sans.) The \"Smaller Vehicle,\" a Scripture and a School of theBuddhists, contrasted with the Mahayana, \"The Greater Vehicle.\" Both schoolsare mystical. (See Mahayana.) Also in exoteric superstition, the lowest formof transmigration.Homogeneity From the Greek words homos, \"the same,\" and genos, \"kind.\" Thatwhich is of the same nature throughout, undifferentiated, non-compound, asgold is supposed to be.Hypnotism (Gr.) A name given by Dr. Braid to the process by which one man ofstrong will-power plunges another of weaker mind into a kind of trance; oncein such a state the latter will do anything suggested to him by thehypnotist. Unless produced for beneficial purposes, the Occultists wouldcall it black magic or sorcery. It is the most dangerous of practices,morally and physically, as it interferes with the nerve fluids.Iamblichus A great Theosophist and an Initiate of the third century. Hewrote a great deal about the various kinds of demons who appear throughevocation, but spoke severely against such phenomena. His austerities,purity of life, and earnestness were great. He is credited with having beenlevitated ten cubits high from the ground, as are some modern Yogis, andmediums.Illusion In Occultism everything finite (such as the Universe and all in it)is called Illusion or Maya .Individuality One of the names given in Theosophy and Occultism to the humanHigher Ego. We make a distinction between the immortal and divine and thePage 155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtmortal human Ego which perishes. The latter or \"Personality\" (personal Ego)survives the dead body but for a time in Kamaloka: the Individualityprevails forever.Initiate From the Latin Initiatus. The designation of anyone who wasreceived into and had revealed to him the mysteries and secrets of eitherMasonry or Occultism. In times of antiquity they were those who had beeninitiated into the arcane knowledge taught by the Hierophants of theMysteries; and in our modern days those who have been initiated by theadepts of mystic lore into the mysterious knowledge, which, notwithstandingthe lapse of ages, has yet a few real votaries on earth.Isvara (Sans.) The \"Lord\" or the personal god, divine spirit in man.Literally Sovereign (independent) existence. A title given to Siva and othergods in India. Siva is also called Isvaradeva, or sovereign deva.Iu-Kabar Zivo Gnostic term. The \"Lord of the Aeons\" in the Nazarene system.He is the procreator (Emanator) of the seven holy lives (the seven primalDhyani-Chohans or Archangels, each representing one of the cardinalvirtues), and is himself called the third life (third Logos). In the Codexhe is addressed as the Helm and Vine of the food of life. Thus he isidentical with Christ (Christos) who says: \"I am the true vine and my Fatheris the husbandman.\" It is well known that Christ is regarded in the RomanCatholic Church as the \"Chief of the Aeons,\" as also is Michael, \"who is asGod.\" Such also was the belief of the Gnostics.Javidan Khirad (Pers.) A work on moral precepts.Jñana (Sans.) Knowledge: Occult Wisdom.Josephus Flavius A historian of the first century; a Hellenized Jew wholived in Alexandria and died at Rome. He was credited by Eusebius withhaving written the 16 famous lines relating to Christ, which were mostprobably interpolated by Eusebius himself, the greatest forger among theChurch Fathers. This passage, in which Josephus, who was an ardent Jew anddied in Judaism, is nevertheless made to acknowledge the Messiahship anddivine origin of Jesus, is now declared spurious both by most of theChristian Bishops (Lardner among others) and even by Paley (See his Evidenceof Christianity). It was for centuries one of the weightiest proofs of thereal existence of Jesus, the Christ.Kamaloka (Sans.) The semi-material plane, to us subjective and invisible,where the disembodied \"personalities,\" the astral forms called Kamarupa,remain until they fade out from it by the complete exhaustion of the effectsof the mental impulses that created these eidolons of the lower animalpassions and desires. (See Kamarupa.) It is the Hades of the ancient Greeksand the Amenti of the Egyptians-the land of Silent Shadows.Kamarupa (Sans.) Metaphysically and in our esoteric philosophy it is thesubjective form created through the mental and physical desires and thoughtsin connection with things of matter, by all sentient beings: a form whichsurvives the death of its body. After that death, three of the sevenprinciples-or, let us say, planes of the senses and consciousness on whichthe human instincts and ideation act in turn-viz., the body, its astralprototype, and physical vitality, being of no further use, remain on earth;the three higher principles, grouped into one, merge into a state ofDevachan, in which state the Higher Ego will remain until the hour for a newreincarnation arrives, and the eidolon of the expersonality is left alone inits new abode. Here the pale copy of the man that was, vegetates for aperiod of time, the duration of which is variable according to the elementof materiality which is left in it, and which is determined by the past lifeof the defunct. Bereft as it is of its higher mind, spirit, and physicalsenses, if left alone to its own senseless devices, it will gradually fadeout and disintegrate. But if forcibly drawn back into the terrestrialPage 156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtsphere, whether by the passionate desires and appeals of the survivingfriends or by regular necromantic practices-one of the most pernicious ofwhich is mediumship-the \"spook\" may prevail for a period greatly exceedingthe span of the natural life of its body. Once the Kamarupa has learnt theway back to living human bodies, it becomes a vampire feeding on thevitality of those who are so anxious for its company. In India theseEidolons are called Pisachas-and are much dreaded.Kapilavastu (Sans.) The birthplace of the Lord Buddha, called the \"yellowdwelling,\" the capital of the monarch who was the father of Gautama Buddha.Kardec, Allan The adopted name of the Founder of the French Spiritists,whose real name was Rivaille. It was he who gathered and published thetrance utterances of certain mediums and afterwards made a \"philosophy\" ofthem between the years 1855 and 1870.Karma (Sans.) Physically, action; Metaphysically, the Law of Retribution;the Law of Cause and Effect or Ethical Causation. It is Nemesis only in thesense of bad Karma. It is the eleventh Nidana in the concatenation of causesand effects in orthodox Buddhism; yet it is the power that controls allthings, the resultant of moral action, the metaphysical Samskâra, or themoral effect of an act committed for the attainment of something whichgratifies a personal desire. There is the Karma of merit and the Karma ofdemerit. Karma neither punishes nor rewards; it is simply the one UniversalLaw which guides unerringly and, so to say, blindly, all other lawsproductive of certain effects along the grooves of their respectivecausations. When Buddhism teaches that \"Karma is that moral Kernel (of anybeing) which alone survives death and continues in transmigration\" orreincarnation, it simply means that there remains nought after eachpersonality, but the causes produced by it, causes which are undying, i.e.,which cannot be eliminated from the Universe until replaced by theirlegitimate effects, and so to speak, wiped out by them. And such causes,unless compensated during the life of the person who produced them withadequate effects, will follow the reincarnated Ego and reach it in itssubsequent incarnations until a full harmony between effects and causes isfully reestablished. No \"personality\"-a mere bundle of material atoms andinstinctual and mental characteristics-can, of course, continue as such inthe world of pure spirit. Only that which is immortal in its very nature anddivine in its essence, namely, the Ego, can exist forever. And as it is thatEgo which chooses the personality it will inform after each Devachan, andwhich receives through these personalities the effects of the Karmic causesproduced, it is, therefore, the Ego, that Self, which is the \"moral Kernel\"referred to, and embodied Karma itself, that \"which alone survives death.\"Kether (Heb.)The Crown, the highest of the ten Sephiroth; the first of the supernalTriad. It corresponds to the Macroprosopus, Vast Countenance, or ArikhAnpin, which differentiates into Chokmah and Binah.Krishna (Sans.) The most celebrated Avatara of Vishnu, the \"Savior\" of theHindus and the most popular god. He is the eighth Avatara, the son of Devaki, and the nephew of Kansa, the Indian Herod, who while seeking for him amongthe shepherds and cowherds who concealed him, slew thousands of theirnewly-born babes. The story of Krishna's conception, birth, and childhoodare the exact prototype of the New Testament story. The missionaries, ofcourse, try to show that the Hindus stole the story of the Nativity from theearly Christians who came to India.Kshetrajña or Kshetrajñesvara (Sans.) Embodied Spirit in Occultism, theconscious Ego in its highest manifestations; the reincarnating Principle, orthe \"Lord\" in us.Kumara (Sans.) A virgin boy or young celibate. The first Kumaras are thePage 157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtseven sons of Brahmâ , born out of the limbs of the god in the so-calledNinth Creation. It is stated that the name was given to them owing to theirformal refusal to \"procreate\" their species, and thus they \"remained Yogis\"according to the legend.Labro, St. A Roman Saint solemnly beatified a few years ago. His greatholiness consisted in sitting at one of the gates of Rome night and day forforty years, and remaining unwashed through the whole of that time, theresult of which was that he was eaten by vermin to his bones.Lao-tzu (Chin.) A great Sage, Saint, and Philosopher, who precededConfucius.Law of Retribution (See Karma).Linga-sharîra (Sans.) \"Astral body,\" i.e., the aerial symbol of the body.This term designates the doppelgänger, or the \"astral body\" of man oranimal. It is the eidolon of the Greeks, the vital and prototypal body, thereflection of the man of flesh. It is born before man and dies or fades outwith the disappearance of the last atom of the body.Logos (Gr.) The manifested deity with every nation and people; the outwardexpression or the effect of the Cause which is ever concealed. Thus, speechis the logos of thought; hence, in its metaphysical sense, it is aptlytranslated by the terms Verbum, and the Word.Long Face A Cabalistic term, Areekh Anpeen in Hebrew; or \"Long Face,\" inGreek, Macroprosopus, as contrasted with \"Short Face,\" or Zeir Anpeen, theMicroprosopus. One relates to Deity, the other to man, the \"little image ofthe great form.\"Longinus, Dionysius Cassius A famous critic and philosopher, born in thevery beginning of the third century (about 213). He was a great traveler,and attended at Alexandria the lectures of Ammonius Saccas, the founder ofNeo-Platonism, but was rather a critic than a follower. Porphyry (the JewMalek or Malchus) was his pupil before he became the disciple of Plotinus.It is said of him that he was a living library and a walking museum. Towardsthe end of his life he became the instructor in Greek literature of Zenobia,Queen of Palmyra. She repaid his services by accusing him before the EmperorAurelius of having advised her to rebel against the latter, a crime forwhich Longinus, with several others, was put to death by the Emperor in 273.Macrocosm (Gr.) The \"Great Universe\" or Kosmos, literally.Magic The \"great\" Science. According to Deveria and other Orientalists,\"Magic was considered as a sacred science inseparable from religion\" by theoldest and most civilized and learned nations. The Egyptians, for instance,were a most sincerely religious nation, as were, and are still, the Hindus.\"Magic consists of, and is acquired by, the worship of the gods,\" saysPlato. Could, then, a nation which, owing to the irrefragable evidence ofinscriptions and papyri, is proved to have firmly believed in magic forthousands of years, have been deceived for so long a time? And is it likelythat generations upon generations of a learned and pious hierarchy, manyamong whom led lives of self-martyrdom, holiness, and asceticism, would havegone on deceiving themselves and the people (or even only the latter) forthe pleasure of perpetuating belief in \"miracles\"? Fanatics, we are told,will do anything to enforce belief in their god or idols. To this we reply:In such cases Brahmins and Egyptian Rekhget-amens or Hierophants, would nothave popularized the belief in the power of man by magic practices, tocommand the services of the gods: which gods are in truth but the occultpowers or potencies of Nature, personified by the learned prieststhemselves, who reverenced only in them the attributes of the one unknownand nameless Principle.Page 158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtAs Proclus, the Platonist, ably puts it:Ancient priests, when they considered that there is a certain alliance andsympathy in natural things to each other, and of things manifest to occultpowers, and discovered that all things subsist in all, fabricated a sacredscience from this mutual sympathy and similarity ... and applied for occultpurposes both celestial and terrene natures, by means of which, through acertain similitude, they deduced divine natures into this inferior abode.Magic is the science of communicating with, and directing supernalsupramundane potencies, as well as commanding those of lower spheres; apractical knowledge of the hidden mysteries of nature which are known onlyto the few, because they are so difficult to acquire without falling intosin against the law. Ancient and medieval mystics divided magic into threeclasses-Theurgia, Goetia, and Natural Magic.Theurgia has long since been appropriated as the peculiar sphere of theTheosophists and metaphysicians,-says Kenneth Mackenzie.Goetia is black magic, and \"natural\" or white magic has risen with healingin its wings to the proud position of an exact and progressive study.The remarks added by our late learned brother are remarkable:The realistic desires of modern times have contributed to bring magic intodisrepute and ridicule ... Faith (in one's own self) is an essential elementin magic, and existed long before other ideas which presume itspreexistence. It is said that it takes a wise man to make a fool; and aman's idea must be exalted almost to madness, i.e., his brainsusceptibilities must be increased far beyond the low miserable status ofmodern civilization, before he can become a true magician, for a pursuit ofthis science implies a certain amount of isolation and an abnegation ofself.A very great isolation certainly, the achievement of which constitutes awonderful phenomenon, a miracle in itself. Withal, magic is not somethingsupernatural. As explained by Iamblichus,... they, through the sacerdotal theurgy, announce that they are able toascend to more elevated and universal essences, and to those that areestablished above fate, viz., to god and the demiurgos: neither employingmatter, nor assuming any other things besides, except the observation of asensible time.Already some are beginning to recognize the existence of subtle powers andinfluences in nature, in which they have hitherto known nought. But, as Dr.Carter Blake truly remarks:The nineteenth century is not that which has observed the genesis of new,nor the completion of old, methods of thought ...-to which Mr. Bonwick adds, that:... if the Ancients knew but little of our mode of investigation into thesecrets of Nature, we know still less of their mode of research.Magic, Black (See above). Sorcery, abuse of powers.Magic, Ceremonial Magic, according to Cabalistic rites worked out, asalleged by the Rosicrucians and other mystics, by invoking Powers higherspiritually than Man, and commanding Elementals who are far lower thanPage 159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txthimself on the scale of being.Magic, White or \"Beneficent Magic,\" so called, is divine magic, devoid ofselfishness, love of power, of ambition or material gain, and bent only ondoing good to the world in general and one's neighbor in particular. Thesmallest attempt to use one's abnormal powers for the gratification of selfmakes of these powers sorcery or Black Magic.Maha-Manvantara (Sans.) Lit., the great interludes between the Manus-theperiod of universal activity. Manvantara here implies simply a period ofactivity as opposed to Pralaya or rest-without reference to the length ofthe cycle.Mahat (Sans.) Lit. \"The Great One.\" The first principle of UniversalIntelligence and consciousness. In the Puranic philosophy, the first productof root-nature or Pradhana (the same as Mûlaprakiti); the producer of Manasthe thinking principle, and of Ahankâra, Egotism or the feeling of \"I am I\"in the lower Manas.Mahatma (Sans.) Lit., \"Great Soul.\" An adept of the highest order. Anexalted being, who having attained to the mastery over his lower principles,is therefore living unimpeded by the \"man of flesh.\" Mahatmas are inpossession of knowledge and power commensurate with the stage they havereached in their spiritual evolution. Called in Pali Rahats and Arahats.Mahayana (Sans.) A school of Buddhist philosophy; lit., the \"Great Vehicle.\"A mystical system founded by Nagarjuna. Its books were written in the secondcentury bc.Manas (Sans.) Lit., the \"Mind.\" The mental faculty which makes of a man anintelligent and moral being, and distinguishes him from the mere animal; asynonym of Mahat. Esoterically, however, it means, when unqualified, theHigher Ego or the sentient reincarnating Principle in man. When qualified itis called by Theosophists Buddhi-Manas, or the spiritual soul, incontradistinction to its human reflection-Kama-Manas.Manasaputra (Sans.) Lit., the \"Sons of Mind\" or mind-born Sons; a name givento our Higher Egos before they incarnated in mankind. In the exoteric thoughallegorical and symbolical Purânas (the sacred and ancient writings ofHindus), it is the title given to the mind-born Sons of Brahmâ , the Kumâra.Manas Sutratman (Sans.) Two words meaning mind (Manas) and Thread Soul(Sutratman). It is, as said, the synonym of our Ego, or that whichreincarnates. It is a technical term of Vedantic philosophy.Manas-Taijas (Sans.) Lit., the \"radiant\" Manas; a state of the Higher Egowhich only high metaphysicians are able to realize and comprehend. The sameas \"Buddhi-Taijas \" (see above).Mantras (Sans.) Verses from the Vedic works, used as incantations andcharms. By Mantras are meant all those portions of the Vedas which aredistinct from the Brâhmanas, or their interpretation.Manu (Sans.) The great Indian legislator. The name comes from the Sanskritroot man, to think, man really standing only for Svayambhuva, the first ofthe Manus, who started from Svayambhu , the Self-Existent, who is hence theLogos and the progenitor of mankind. Manu is the first legislator-almost adivine being.Manvantara (Sans.) A period of manifestation, as opposed to Pralaya(dissolution or rest); the term is applied to various cycles, especially toa Day of Brahmâ -4,320,000,000 Solar years-and to the reign of oneManu-308,448,000. Lit., Manvantara-\"between Manus.\"Page 160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtMaster A translation from the Sanskrit Guru, \"Spiritual teacher,\" andadopted by the Theosophists to designate the Adepts, from whom they holdtheir teachings.Materializations In Spiritualism the word signifies the objective appearanceof the so-called \"spirits of the dead,\" who reclothe themselves occasionallyin matter; i.e., they form for themselves out of the materials at hand foundin the atmosphere and the emanations of those present, a temporary bodybearing the human likeness of the defunct, as he appeared when alive.Theosophists accept the phenomenon of \"materialization,\" but they reject thetheory that it is produced by \"Spirits,\" i.e., the immortal principles ofdisembodied persons. Theosophists hold that when the phenomena aregenuine-which is a fact of rarer occurrence than is generally believed-theyare produced by the larvae, the eidolons, or Kamalokic \"ghosts\" of the deadpersonalities. (See Kamaloka and Kamarupa.) As Kamaloka is on theearth-plane and differs from its degree of materiality only in the degree ofits plane of consciousness, for which reason it is concealed from our normalsight, the occasional apparition of such shells is as natural as that ofelectric balls and other atmospheric phenomena. Electricity as a fluid, oratomic matter (for Occultists hold with Maxwell that it is atomic), is ever,though invisibly, present in the air and manifests under various shapes, butonly when certain conditions are present to \"materialize\" the fluid, when itpasses from its own onto our plane and makes itself objective. Similarlywith the eidolons of the dead. They are present around us, but being onanother plane do not see us any more than we see them. But whenever thestrong desires of living men and the conditions furnished by the abnormalconstitutions of mediums are combined together, these eidolons are drawn-naypulled down from their plane onto ours and made objective. This isnecromancy; it does no good to the dead, and great harm to the living, inaddition to the fact that it interferes with a law of nature. The occasionalmaterialization of the \"astral bodies\" or doubles of living persons is quiteanother matter. These \"astrals\" are often mistaken for the apparitions ofthe dead, since, chameleon-like, our own \"elementaries\" along with those ofthe disembodied and cosmic Elementals, will often assume the appearance ofthose images which are strongest in our thoughts. In short, at the so-called\"materialization seances,\" it is those present and the medium who create thepeculiar apparition. Independent \"apparitions\" belong to another kind ofpsychic phenomena.Materialist Not necessarily only one who believes in neither God nor soul,nor the survival of the latter, but also any person who materializes thepurely spiritual; such as believe in an anthropomorphic deity, in a soulcapable of burning in hell fire, and a hell and paradise as localitiesinstead of states of consciousness. American \"Substantialists,\" a Christiansect, are materialists, as also the so-called Spiritualists.Maya (Sans.) Illusion; the cosmic power which renders phenomenal existenceand the perceptions thereof possible. In Hindu philosophy that alone whichis changeless and eternal is called reality: all that which is subject tochange through decay and differentiation, and which has, therefore, abeginning and an end, is regarded as Maya -illusion.Mediumship A word now accepted to indicate that abnormalpsycho-physiological state which leads a person to take the fancies of hisimagination, his hallucinations, real or artificial, for realities. Noentirely healthy person on the physiological and psychic planes can ever bea medium. That which mediums see, hear, and sense, is \"real\" but untrue; itis either gathered from the astral plane, so deceptive in its vibrations andsuggestions, or from pure hallucinations, which have no actual existence,but for him who perceives them. \"Mediumship\" is a kind of vulgarizedmediatorship in which one afflicted with this faculty is supposed to becomean agent of communication between a living man and a departed \"Spirit.\"There exist regular methods of training for the development of thisundesirable acquirement.Page 161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtMerkabah (Heb.)A chariot. The Cabalists say that the Supreme, after he had established theten Sephiroth-which, in their totality, are Adam Kadmon, the Archetypal Man,used them as a chariot or throne of glory in which to descend upon the soulsof men.Mesmerism The term comes from Mesmer, who rediscovered this magnetic forceand its practical application toward the year 1775, at Vienna. It is a vitalcurrent that one person may transfer to another; and through which heinduces an abnormal state of the nervous system that permits him to have adirect influence upon the mind and will of the subject or mesmerized person.Metaphysics From the Greek meta, beyond, and physica, the things of theexternal material world. It is to forget the spirit and hold to the deadletter, to translate it beyond nature or supernatural, as it is ratherbeyond the natural, visible, or concrete. Metaphysics, in ontology andphilosophy is the term to designate that science which treats of the realand permanent being as contrasted with the unreal, illusionary, orphenomenal being.Microcosm The \"little\" Universe meaning man, made in the image of hiscreator, the Macrocosm, or \"great\" Universe, and containing all that thelatter contains. These terms are used in Occultism and Theosophy.Mishnah (Heb.) Lit., \"a repetition\" from the word Shânâh, \"to repeat\"something said orally. A summary of written explanations from the oraltraditions of the Jews and a digest of the Scriptures on which the laterTalmud was based.Moksha (Sans.) The same as Nirvana; a postmortem state of rest and bliss ofthe \"Soul-pilgrim.\"Monad It is the Unity, the One; but in occultism it often means the unifiedduad, Atma-Buddhi-or that immortal part of man which incarnating in thelower kingdoms and gradually progressing through them to Man, finds thenceway to the final goal-Nirvana.Monas (Gr.) The same as the Latin Monad, \"the only,\" a Unit. In thePythagorean system the Duad emanates from the higher and solitary Monas,which is thus the First Cause.Monogenes (Gr.) Literally, the \"only-begotten,\" a name of Proserpine andother gods and goddesses, as also of Jesus.Mundakya Upanishad (Sans.) Lit., the \"Mundaka esoteric doctrine.\" A work ofhigh antiquity; it has been translated by Raja Ram Mohun Roy.Mysteries, Sacred They were enacted in the ancient temples by the initiatedHierophants for the benefit and instruction of candidates. The most solemnand occult were certainly those which were performed in Egypt by \"the bandof secret-keepers,\" as Mr. Bonwick calls the Hierophants. Maurice describestheir nature very graphically in a few lines. Speaking of the Mysteriesperformed in Philae (the Nile-island), he says:It was in these gloomy caverns that the grand mystic arcana of the goddess(Isis) were unfolded to the adoring aspirant, while the solemn hymn ofinitiation resounded through the long extent of these stony recesses.The word mystery is derived from the Greek mu , \"to close the mouth,\" andevery symbol connected with them had a hidden meaning. As Plato and many ofthe other sages of antiquity affirm, these mysteries were highly religious,moral, and beneficent as a school of ethics. The Grecian Mysteries, those ofPage 162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtCeres and Bacchus, were only imitations of the Egyptian, and the author ofEgyptian Belief and Modern Thought informs us that our own word \"chapel orcapella is said to be the caph-el or college of El, the solar divinity.\" Thewell-known Cabiri are associated with the mysteries.In short, the Mysteries were in every country a series of dramaticperformances, in which the mysteries of Cosmogony and nature in general werepersonified by the priests and neophytes, who enacted the parts of variousgods and goddesses, repeating supposed scenes (allegories) from theirrespective lives. These were explained in their hidden meaning to thecandidates for initiation and incorporated into philosophical doctrines.Mystery Language The sacerdotal secret \"jargon\" used by the initiatedpriests, and employed only when discussing sacred things. Every nation hadits own \"mystery\" tongue, unknown to all save those admitted to theMysteries.Mystic From the Greek word mysticos. In antiquity, one belonging to thoseadmitted to the ancient mysteries; in our own times, one who practicesmysticism, holds mystic, transcendental views, etc.Mysticism Any doctrine involved in mystery and metaphysics, and dealing morewith the ideal worlds than with our matter-of-fact, actual universe.Nazarene Codex The Scriptures of the Nazarenes and of the Nabotheans also.According to sundry Church Fathers, Jerome and Epiphanius especially, theywere heretical teachings, but are in fact one of the numerous Gnosticreadings of cosmogony and theogony, which produced a distinct sect.Necromancy The raising of the images of the dead, considered in antiquityand by modern occultists as a practice of Black Magic. Iamblichus, Porphyry,and other theurgists deprecated the practice no less than Moses, whocondemned the \"witches\" of his day to death, the said witches being oftenonly mediums, e.g., the case of the Witch of Endor and Samuel.Neo-Platonists A school of philosophy which arose between the second andthird century of our era, and was founded by Ammonius Saccas, of Alexandria.The same as the Philaletheians, and the Analogeticists; they were alsocalled Theurgists and by various other names. They were the Theosophists ofthe early centuries. Neo-Platonism is Platonic philosophy plus ecstasy,divine R®ja-Yoga.Nephesh (Heb.)Breath of Life, Anima, Mens Vitae, appetites. The term is used very looselyin the Bible. It generally means Prana, \"life\"; in the Cabala it is theanimal passions and the animal soul. Therefore, as maintained intheosophical teachings, Nephesh is the Prana-Kama Principle, or the vitalanimal soul in man.Nirmanakaya (Sans.) Something entirely different in esoteric philosophy fromthe popular meaning attached to it, and from the fancies of theOrientalists. Some call the Nirmanakaya body \"Nirvana with remains\"(Schlagintweit), on the supposition, probably, that it is a kind of Nirvaniccondition during which consciousness and form are retained. Others say thatit is one of the Trikaya (three bodies) with \"the power of assuming any formof appearance in order to propagate Buddhism.\" Again, that \"it is theincarnate Avatara of a deity.\" Occultism, on the other hand, says thatNirmanakaya, although meaning literally a transformed \"body,\" is a state.The form is that of the Adept or Yogi who enters, or chooses, thatpostmortem condition in preference to the Dharmakaya or absolute Nirvanicstate. He does this because the latter Kaya separates him forever from theworld of form, conferring upon him a state of selfish bliss, in which noother living being can participate, the adept being thus precluded from thePage 163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtpossibility of helping humanity, or even devas. As a Nirmanakaya, however,the adept leaves behind him only his physical body, and retains every otherprinciple save the Kamic, for he has crushed this out forever from hisnature during life, and it can never resurrect in his postmortem state.Thus, instead of going into selfish bliss, he chooses a life ofself-sacrifice, an existence which ends only with the life cycle, in orderto be enabled to help mankind in an invisible, yet most effective, manner.Thus a Nirmanakaya is not, as popularly believed, the body \"in which aBuddha or a Bodhisattva appears on earth,\" but verily one who, whether aChutuktu or a Khubilkhan, an adept or a Yogi during life, has since become amember of that invisible Host which ever protects and watches over humanitywithin Karmic limits. Mistaken often for a \"Spirit,\" a Deva, God himself,etc., a Nirmanakaya is ever a protecting, compassionate, verily a guardian,angel to him who is worthy of his help. Whatever objection may be broughtforward against this doctrine, however much it is denied, because, forsooth,it has never hitherto been made public in Europe, and therefore, since it isunknown to Orientalists, it must needs be a \"myth of modern invention\"-noone will be bold enough to say that this idea of helping suffering mankindat the price of one's own almost interminable self-sacrifice, is not one ofthe grandest and noblest that was ever evolved from the human brain.Nirvana (Sans.) According to the Orientalists, the entire \"blowing-out,\"like the flame of a candle, the utter extinction of existence. But in theexoteric explanations it is the state of absolute existence and absoluteconsciousness, into which the Ego of a man who had reached the highestdegree of perfection and holiness during life, goes after the body dies, andoccasionally, as is the case of Gautama Buddha and others, during life.Nirvanee (Sans.) One who has attained Nirvana-an emancipated Soul. ThatNirvana means something quite different from the puerile assertions ofOrientalists, every scholar who has visited India, China, or Japan, is wellaware. It is \"escape from misery,\" but only from that of matter, freedomfrom Klesha, or Kama, and the complete extinction of animal desires. If weare told that Abhidharma defines Nirvana as \"a state of absoluteannihilation\" we concur, adding to the last word the qualification \"ofeverything connected with matter or the physical world,\" and this simplybecause the latter (as also all in it) is illusion or Maya . SakyamuniBuddha said in the last moments of his life: \"the spiritual body isimmortal.\" As Mr. Eitel, the scholarly Sinologist, explains it:The popular exoteric systems agree in defining Nirvana negatively as a stateof absolute exemption from the circle of transmigration; as a state ofentire freedom from all forms of existence, to begin with, freedom from allpassion and exertion; a state of indifference to all sensibility.-and he might have added \"death of all compassion for the world ofsuffering.\" And this is why the Bodhisattvas who prefer the Nirmanakaya tothe Dharmakaya vesture stand higher in the popular estimation than theNirvanees. But the same scholar adds that:Positively (and esoterically) they define Nirvana as the highest state ofspiritual bliss, as absolute immortality through absorption of the Soul(Spirit rather) into itself, but preserving individuality, so that, e.g.,Buddhas, after entering Nirvana, may reappear on earth-i.e., in the futureManvantara.Noumena (Gr.) The true essential nature of Being as distinguished from theillusive objects of sense.Nous (Gr.) A Platonic term for the Higher Mind or Soul. It means Spirit asdistinct from animal-Soul, Psyche; divine consciousness or mind in man. Thename was adopted by the Gnostics for their first conscious Aeon, which, withthe Occultists, is the third logos, cosmically, and the third principle(from above) or Manas, in man. (See Nout.)Page 164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtNout (Eg.) In the Egyptian Pantheon it meant the \"One-only-One,\" because itdoes not proceed in the popular or exoteric religion higher than the thirdmanifestation which radiates from the Unknowable and the Unknown in theesoteric philosophy of every nation. The Nous of Anaxagoras was the Mahat ofthe Hindus-Brahmâ , the first manifested deity-\"the Mind or spiritSelf-potent.\" This creative principle is the primum mobile of everything tobe found in the Universe-its Soul or Ideation. (see \"Seven Principles\" inman.)Occultism See Occult Sciences.Occult Sciences The science of the secrets of nature-physical and psychic,mental and spiritual; called Hermetic and Esoteric Sciences. In the west,the Cabala may be named; in the east, mysticism, magic, and Yoga philosophy.The latter is often referred to by the Chelas in India as the seventh\"Darshana\" (school of philosophy), there being only six Darshanas in Indiaknown to the world of the profane. These sciences are, and have been forages, hidden from the vulgar, for the very good reason that they would neverbe appreciated by the selfish educated classes, who would misuse them fortheir own profit, and thus turn the Divine science into black magic, nor bythe uneducated, who would not understand them. It is often brought forwardas an accusation against the Esoteric Philosophy of the Cabala, that itsliterature is full of \"a barbarous and meaningless jargon,\" unintelligibleto the ordinary mind. But do not exact Sciences-medicine, physiology,chemistry, and the rest-plead guilty to the same impeachment? Do notofficial scientists veil their facts and discoveries with a newly-coined andmost barbarous Graeco-Latin terminology? As justly remarked by our lateBrother, Kenneth Mackenzie,... to juggle thus with words, when the facts are so simple, is the art of theScientists of the present time, in striking contrast to those of theseventeenth century, who called spades, and not \"agricultural implements.\"Moreover, whilst their \"facts\" spades would be as simple, and ascomprehensible if rendered in ordinary language, the facts of Occult Scienceare of so abstruse a nature, that in most cases no words exist in Europeanlanguages to express them. Finally our \"jargon\" is a double necessity-(a)for describing clearly these facts to one who is versed in the occultterminology; and (b) for concealing them from the profane.Occultist One who practices Occultism, an adept in the Secret Sciences, butvery often applied to a mere student.Occult World, The The name of the first book which treated of Theosophy, itshistory, and certain of its tenets. Written by A.P. Sinnett, then editor ofthe leading Indian paper, The Pioneer, of Allahabad, India.Olympiodorus The last Neo-platonist of fame and celebrity in the school ofAlexandria. He lived in the sixth century under the Emperor Justinian. Therewere several writers and philosophers of this name in pre-Christian as inpost-Christian periods. One of these was the teacher of Proclus, another ahistorian in the eighth century, and so on.Origen A Christian Churchman, born at the end of the second century,probably in Africa, of whom little, if anything, is known, since hisbiographical fragments have passed to posterity on the authority ofEusebius, the most unmitigated falsifier that has ever existed in any age.The latter is credited with having collected upwards of one hundred lettersof Origen (or Origenes Adamantius), which are now said to have been lost. ToTheosophists, the most interesting of all the works of Origen is hisDoctrine of the Preexistence of Souls. He was a pupil of Ammonius Saccas,and for a long time attended the lectures of this great teacher ofphilosophy.Page 165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtPanaenus A Platonic philosopher in the Alexandrian school of thePhilaletheians.Pandora In Greek Mythology, the first woman on earth, created by Vulcan outof clay to punish Prometheus and counteract his gift to mortals.

Thus, when his brother Epimetheus sawand married her, when he opened the box, all the evils now afflictinghumanity issued from it, and have remained since then in the world.Pantheist One who identifies God with nature and vice versa.

One of themost intelligent and esteemed communities in the country, generally occupiedwith commercial pursuits. There are between 50,000 and 60,000 now left inIndia where they settled some 1,000 years ago.Personality The teachings of Occultism divide man into three aspects-thedivine, the thinking or rational, and the irrational or animal man. Formetaphysical purposes also he is considered under a septenary division, or,as it is agreed to express it in Theosophy, he is composed of sevenprinciples, three of which constitute the Higher Triad, and the remainingfour the lower Quaternary. It is in the latter that dwells the Personalitywhich embraces all the characteristics, including memory and consciousness,of each physical life in turn. The Individuality is the Higher Ego (Manas)of the Triad considered as a Unity. In other words the Individuality is ourimperishable Ego which reincarnates and clothes itself in a new Personalityat every new birth.Phallic Worship or Sex Worship; reverence and adoration shown to those godsand goddesses which, like Shiva and Durga in India, symbolize respectivelythe two sexes.Philadelphians Lit., \"those who love their brother-man.\" A sect in theseventeenth century, founded by one Jane Leadly. They objected to all rites,forms, or ceremonies of the Church, and even to the Church itself, butprofessed to be guided in soul and spirit by an internal Deity, their ownEgo or God within them.Philaletheians See Neo-Platonists.Philo Judaeus A Hellenized Jew of Alexandria, a famous historian andphilosopher of the first century, born about the year 30 bc, and diedbetween the years 45 and 50 ad Philo's symbolism of the Bible is veryremarkable.

In Theosophy it symbolizes the transmutation of the lower animalnature of man into the highest divine.Phren A Pythagorean term denoting what we call the Kama-Manas, stillovershadowed by Buddhi-Manas.Plane From the Latin Planus (level, flat), an extension of space, whether inthe physical or metaphysical sense.

He taught adoctrine identical with that of the Vedantins, namely, that the spirit soulemanating from the One Deific Principle was after its pilgrimage on earthreunited to it. (See Theosophical Glossary.)Porphyry (Porphyrius). His real name was Malek, which led to his beingregarded as a Jew. He came from Tyre, and having first studied underLonginus, the eminent philosopher-critic, became the disciple of Plotinus,at Rome. He was a Neo-Platonist and a distinguished writer, specially famousfor his controversy with Iamblichus regarding the evils attending thepractice of Theurgy, but was, however, finally converted to the views of hisopponent. A natural-born mystic he followed, like his master Plotinus, thepure Indian Raja-Yoga system, which, by training, leads to the union of thesoul with the oversoul of the universe, and of the human with its divinesoul, Buddhi-Manas. He complains, however, that in spite of all his efforts,he reached the highest state of ecstasy only once, and that when he wassixty-eight years of age, while his teacher Plotinus had experienced thesupreme bliss six times during his life.

As, however, a glossary cannot contain the fullexplanation of every term in all its metaphysical and subtle differences, wecan only state here that these terms vary in their applications, accordingto whether they relate to the past or the present birth, and whether one orthe other of these phases of memory emanates from the spiritual or thematerial brain; or, again, from the \"Individuality\" or the \"Personality.\"Reincarnation or Rebirth The once universal doctrine, which taught that theEgo is born on this earth an innumerable number of times. Now-a-days it isdenied by Christians, who seem to misunderstand the teachings of their owngospels. Nevertheless, the putting on of flesh periodically and throughoutlong cycles by the higher human Soul (Buddhi-Manas) or Ego is taught in theBible as it is in all other ancient scriptures, and \"resurrection\" meansonly the rebirth of the Ego in another form.

He was alsothe preceptor of Melancthon, and was greatly persecuted by the clergy forhis glorification of the Hebrew Cabala, though at the same time called the\"Father of the Reformation.\" He died in 1522, in great poverty, the commonfate of all who in those days went against the dead-letter of the Church.Sacred Science The epithet given to the occult sciences in general, and bythe Rosicrucians to the Cabala, and especially to the Hermetic philosophy.Samadhi The name in India for spiritual ecstasy.

There is,however, a vast difference between the views of the latter and thephilosophical teachings of Eastern Occultists. Spiritists belong to theFrench School founded by Allan Kardec, and the Spiritualists of America andEngland to that of the \"Fox girls,\" who inaugurated their theories atRochester, U.S.A.

(See Theosophical Glossary)Theurgy From the Greek theiourgiá. Rites for bringing down to earthplanetary and other Spirits or Gods. To arrive at the realization of such anobject, the Theurgist had to be absolutely pure and unselfish in hismotives. The practice of theurgy is very undesirable and even dangerous inthe present day. The world has become too corrupt and wicked for thepractice of that which such holy and learned men as Ammonius, Plotinus,Porphyry, and Iamblichus (the most learned Theurgist of all) could aloneattempt with impunity. In our day theurgy or divine, beneficent magic is buttoo apt to become goëtic, or in other words Sorcery.

These are all earlier than thePage 170"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtsixth century bc. Like the Cabala, which interprets the esoteric sense ofthe Bible, so the Upanishads explain the mystic sense of the Vedas.Professor Cowell has two statements regarding the Upanishads as interestingas they are correct. Thus he says:These works have (1) ... one remarkable peculiarity, the total absence of anyBrahmanical exclusiveness in their doctrine ... They breathe an entirelydifferent spirit, a freedom of thought unknown in any earlier work exceptthe Rig-Veda hymns themselves; and (2) the great teachers of the higherknowledge (Gupta-Vidya ), and Brahmins, are continually represented as goingto Kshatriya Kings to become their pupils (Chelas).This shows conclusively that (a) the Upanishads were written before theenforcement of caste and Brahmanical power, and are thus only second inantiquity to the Vedas; and (b) that the occult sciences or the \"higherknowledge,\" as Cowell puts it, is far older than the Brahmins in India, oreven of them as a caste.

It isYajñavalkya, a famous and very ancient sage, to whom the White Yajur-Veda,the Satapatha-Brahmana and the Brihak-Aranyaka are attributed and who livedin pre-Mahabharatean times, who is credited with inculcating the necessityand positive duty of religious meditation and retirement into the forests,and who, therefore, is believed to have originated the Yoga doctrine.Professor Max Müller states that it is Yajñavalkya who prepared the worldfor the preaching of Buddha. Patañjali's Yoga, however, is more definite andprecise as a philosophy, and embodies more of the occult sciences than anyof the works attributed to Yajñavalkya.Yogi or Yogin (Sans.)

Itsfounders believed that the best interests of Religion and Science would bepromoted by the revival of Sanskrit, Pali, Zend, and other ancientliterature, in which the Sages and Initiates had preserved for the use ofmankind truths of the highest value respecting man and nature. A Society ofan absolutely unsectarian character, whose work should be amicablyprosecuted by the learned of all races, in a spirit of unselfish devotion tothe research of truth, and with the purpose of disseminating it impartially,seemed likely to do much to check materialism and strengthen the waningreligious spirit. The simplest expression of the objects of the Society isthe following:1. To form the nucleus of a Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, withoutdistinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or color.2. To promote the study of ryan and other Eastern literatures, religions,and sciences.3. A third object-pursued by a portion only of the members of the Society-isto investigate unexplained laws of nature and the psychical powers of man.No person's religious opinions are asked upon his joining, nor isinterference with them permitted, but everyone is required, beforeadmission, to promise to show towards his fellow-members the same tolerancein this respect as he claims for himself.The headquarters, offices, and managing staff are at Adyar, a suburb ofMadras, where the Society has a property of twenty-seven acres and extensivebuildings, including one for the Oriental Library, and a spacious hallwherein the General Council meets annually in Convention, on the 27th ofDecember.The Society is not yet endowed, but there is a nucleus of a Fund, the incomefrom the investment of which will go towards defraying the current expenses;these have hitherto been met by the proceeds of entrance-fees, donations,and a small annual subscription from each member. But by the Revised Rulesof 1889, the Society has been placed upon a basis of voluntarycontributions, and is therefore entirely dependent for maintenance upon thegenerosity of its Fellows and others, as Entrance Fees and Annual Dues areabolished. No salaries are paid; all work is done by volunteers, who receivesimple food and necessary clothing, when their private circumstances requiresuch allowances.Page 172"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtThe Official Trustee for all Society property is the President for the timebeing, and legacies and bequests should invariably be made in his name, inthe legal phraseology of the Code of the country where the testator executeshis Will. If left to the Society by name, the bequest becomes void in law.The President's full address is Henry Steel Olcott, Adyar, Madras, India.The Society, as a body, eschews politics and all subjects outside itsdeclared sphere of work. The Rules stringently forbid members to compromiseits strict neutrality in these matters.Many Branches of the Society have been formed in various parts of the world,and new ones are constantly being organized. Each branch frames its ownbylaws and manages its own local business without interference fromHeadquarters; provided only that the fundamental rules of the Society arenot violated. Branches lying within certain territorial limits (as forinstance, America, British Islands, Ceylon, etc., have been grouped forpurposes of administration in territorial Sections). For particulars, seethe Revised Rules of 1889, where all necessary information with regard tojoining the Society, etc., will also be found.There have been founded up to date (1889) 173 Branches of the Society.

The petitioner is not a religious body. I report this negative findingfor the reason that the word Theosophical contained in petitioners' nameconveys a possible religious implication. The statutory phrase \"societyformed for religious purposes\" applies, I suppose, only to an organizationformed in part for worship, worship being an individual act involvingadoration and perhaps emotional power, both being of necessity individualacts, or else to an organization formed for a propagation of a religiousfaith. Merely to teach a religion as one may teach algebra, is not, I think,a religious work, as the word religious is used in the Statute and theConstitution. A man may occupy a collegiate chair of Professor of Religionsand as such teach the tenets of many religions. These different religionsbeing variant and antagonistic, the Professor could not by any possibilityworship under all. Nay, he might even be irreligious. Hence, merely teachingreligions is not a religious work in the statutory sense. It will be notedthat in article two of this society's constitution, the word religion isused in the plural. To teach religions is educational, not religious. \"Topromote the study of religions\" is in part to promote the study of thehistory of man. I add the subordinate finding that the society has noreligious creed and practices no worship.2. The petitioner proposes to promote the study of literature and sciences.These objects are expressly within the terms of the Statute.3. Cognate with the last objects is that of investigating \"unexplained lawsof nature and psychical powers latent in man.\" These two phrases, taken inPage 173"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txttheir apparent meaning, are unobjectionable. But there is reason to believethat they form a meaning other than the apparent one.The court will take notice of the commonly accepted meaning of the wordTheosophy. Though I am ignorant of Theosophy, I think it is supposed toinclude among other things manifestations and phenomena, physical andpsychical, that are violations of the laws now known by physicists andmetaphysicians, and perhaps not explained or claimed to be explained orunderstood even by Theosophists themselves. In this group may be includedSpiritualism, mesmerism, clairvoyance, mind-healing, mind-reading and thelike. I took testimony on this question, and found that while a belief inany one of these sorts of manifestations and phenomena is not required,while each member of the society is at liberty to hold his own opinion, yetsuch questions form topics of inquiry and discussion, and the members as amass probably believers individually in phenomena that are abnormal and inpowers that are superhuman as far as science now knows. It is undoubtedlythe right of any citizen to hold whatever opinions he pleases on thesesubjects, and to endeavor at his pleasure to investigate the unexplained andto display the latent. But the question here is: Shall the Court grant afranchise in aid of such endeavor? Voodooism is a word applied to thepractices of guileful men among the ignorant and superstitious who inflictimpostures upon guileless men among the ignorant and superstitious. No Courtwould grant a franchise in furtherance of such practices. The Court thenwill stop to inquire into the practices and perhaps the reputation of theenterprise which seeks judicial aid. I am not meaning to make a comparisonbetween voodooism and this group of phenomena which for convenience (thoughI know not whether accurately) I will call occultism. I only take voodooismas a strong case to show the Court ought to inquire. If we now inquire intooccultism we shall find that it has been occasionally used, as is reported,for the purposes of imposture. But this goes for nothing against itsessential character. Always and everywhere bad men will make a bad use ofanything for selfish ends. The object of this society, whether attainable ornot, is undeniably laudable, assuming that there are physical and psychicalphenomena unexplained, and that Theosophy seeks to explain them. Assumingthat there are human powers yet latent, it seeks to discover them. It may bethat absurdities and impostures are in fact incident to the nascent stage ofits development. As to an understanding like that of occultism, whichasserts powers commonly thought superhuman, and phenomena commonly thoughtsupernatural, it seemed to me that the Court, though not assuming todetermine judicially the question of their verity, would, before granting tooccultism a franchise, inquire whether at least it had gained the positionof being reputable or whether its adherents were merely men of narrowintelligence, mean intellect, and omnivorous credulity. I accordingly tooktestimony on that point, and find that a number of gentlemen in differentcountries of Europe, and also in this country, eminent in science, arebelievers in occultism. Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, a writer of large andvaried learning, and of solid intellect, is asserted to have been anoccultist, an assertion countenanced by at least two of his books. The latePresident Wayland, of Brown University, writing of abnormal mentaloperations as shown in clairvoyance, says:The subject seems to me well worthy of the most searching and candidexamination. It is by no means deserving of ridicule, but demands theattention of the most philosophical inquiry.Sir William Hamilton, probably the most acute and, undeniably, the mostlearned of English metaphysicians that ever lived, said at least thirtyyears ago:However astonishing, it is now proved beyond all rational doubt that incertain abnormal states of the nervous organism perceptions are possiblethrough other than the ordinary channels of the senses.By such testimony Theosophy is at least placed on the footing ofPage 174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Key To Theosophy - HP Blavatsky.txtrespectability. Whether by further labor it can make partial truths completetruths, whether it can eliminate extravagances and purge itself ofimpurities, if there are any, are probably questions upon which the Courtwill not feel called upon to pass. I perceive no other feature of thepetitioners' constitution that is obnoxious to legal objection, andaccordingly I have the honor to report that I show no cause why the prayerof the petitioners should not be granted.- AUGUST W.
