Egan, late President of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and head of the J.A. Fay & Egan Co., woodworking machinery company, is given credit for founding the National As sociation of Manufacturers 50 years ago . Jam es E. Finger, New York Director of Promotion of the N.A.M., said the magazine \"Dixie,\" published at Atlanta, Ga. , carried an editorial during the depression of 1894, urging the Nation's manufacturers to organize and work together to imp�ove business conditions . This group was called the \"Big 50\" and under Egan's leadership invited the manufacturers of the country to meet at Cincinnati, Jan. 25, 1895, to form their first National Association, Finger said. They met at Oddfe11ows Temple - 583 manufacturers attending - and formed the National Association of Manufacturers, that now has 1205 members . Egan was born in [Limerick] Ireland 1874 [= Nov . 20, 1847] and came to-Cincinnati from Canada [Hamilton, Ontario] in his youth. After he lost an arm while working in the factory at Steptoe, McFarland & Co ., pioneer woodworking firm at Cincin­nati, Egan was employed in that Company's office. He became an outstanding salesman, formed a company of his own and was later President of what was the largest w oodworking plant in the world, the Fay & Egan Company . Egan was firs t President of the Cincinnati Manufacturers' Association and President of the Chamber of Commerce in 1908. He died Jan . 10, 1922 [Cincinnati , Ohio, Times Star, Jan. 24, 1945, p.2]. In 1900 he was awarded the decoration of \"Legion of Honor\" by the French Government, because the woodworking machinery which he had designed proved of such value in the development of that industry in France [Fay & Egan's Lightning Line, v.2, No . 124, Feb . 1922, p.7].

Stories and descriptions are something special; no two persons would agree on the same list. Here are a few with item, not page number: 7, 8, 16, 17, 62, 78, 84, 101 , 203, 204, 205, 214, 239, 242, 311 , 424, 427 , 546, 547, 559, 568, 569, 576, 577 , 578, 602, 722, 723, 822, 916, 920, 921, 922, 927 (one for psychologist), 928 (time and psychology), 1000, 2757 (private shrine - private spirit), 2760 (pUblic shrine), 3070 (fabulous doctor Buzzard), 3088 (woman who got sanctified), 3092-3095 (celebrated George Jackson) , and not item but page 1125, line 4 through page 1126 (John the slave builds a house), and also page 1601, last title quotation (poetry). Problems? Everywhere! (1) They varied between Atlantic coast and New Orleans area, coastal flats and higher ground, city and country, city and city, and him who stayed at home and him who had lived in a large n orthern city. Besides these differences, I had the problem of studying each informant as a unique individual with a personality of his own. Why? Because I am a priest of the Episcopal Church, a part of �e world-wide Anglican Church (see p.160l, my comment follow­ing title). I respected him or her as persons, until he or she showed cause for non-respect. That cause never happened . No, you do not wear your collar turned backward while collecting witchcraft. Backward, as every folklore scholar knows, scares spirits away. (2) Lowland dialects were difficult and at times impossi­ble. All that remains of average l anguage will be found in my phonograph album, 4-12\" 78rpm records -ROOT DOCTOR� A FOLKLORE STUDY� in which a Negro healer ). explains his work ••• published by the Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation, and for sale by Harry M. Hyatt, Box 12, South Branah, N. J. Copyright 1942. This material -marked out into the 8 sides of the 4 phonograph records - will be found in the preceding MY FIRST DOCTOR. We had a small farm at South Branch, 100 yards from the confluence of the North and South Branches of the Raritan River. To \"River­brook\". we frequently retired, leaving the noise and dirt of New York City. (3) Reference following story and description or preceding INTERVIEW is for locality where collected; cylinder numbers, no longer important, are confusing before Mobile work because transcriber began numbering with Telediphone cylinders, whereas I started with the original 85 Ediphone cylinders I had transcribed by hand. (4) The usual disk type of recording would have been impossible for witch­craft. I sp$ak for myself and collecting days. How others recorded witchcraft then or since I do not know. (5) Punctuation was a headache! In doubt, or when weary of striving, I used the dash. (6) My greatest problem was trying to reduce a mass of intractable material to a semblance of order. I solved the pr oblem by transposing everything into music, into a free fantasia of three movements on a given theme -Spirits, Doators, Interviews. Yes , I did the end - INTERVIEWS -"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"firs t! The underlining of words and sentences - sometimes too much, other times too little - was done to help the eye find things among small print and unindexed material. E��ata -not many for a work like this - will be printed later. Despite an index of first lines for all stories and statements , I trusted my memory once too often -655 on p.22l repeats 105 on p.39. There may be one or two more. How and where to keep odds and ends was always a problem. One little gem I wanted for margin title INCENSE under BUSINESS (p . 700), I lost and found several times. Here it is: \"Dey burn diff'rent incent [incense].

The (550) = informant's number , 689 -cylinder number, and 5 = space number . For parenthesis and bracket, and for special bracket [demonstrates], see INTRODUCTION , p.I, paragraphs 1 and 2.] . Since this material was collected under the old Abna Egan Hyatt Foundation, it has every right to be called by that name. I fought through cold and heat and many discomforts for this material that answers the question - What's out th ere? Twice I had serious dialogues with the police - these to be described with documents in the completed Introduction . A white man who did his interviewing throughout all Southern States except Texas, not in white-folks kitchens but in black homes and hotels (see illustrations) -I mean before World War II , not after Sebna -I could expect a little trouble. After all, the work I was seeking to record was called unde�orZd work (p .659). The experience I brought to the field , everything , will eventually be told in the Introduction. Here I pause in memory, stop and thank those many lowly and unedu­cated and underprivileged people who came to me - sometimes in fear (p. 140l, last title quotation) , often in hunger (p .164l, title quotation).

These recordings took an expert transcriber more than 1 1/2 years to transcribe. What did they in totality - collecting , arranging, editing and publishing - require from me? That is the purpose of this introduction . As an appropriate vehicle to convey the atmosphere of strangeness soon to envelope us , we have a living text - one vast quotation , a dialogue interrupted only by titles and occasional explanatory note. To identify these ever-present two speakers - ALL PARENTHESES AND BRACKETS ENCLOSE MY WORDS; the former indi­cating question or comment during actual interview, the latter denoting subse­quent editorial matter. EVERYTHING ELSE BELONGS TO THE INFORMANTS. That word dialogue is more than a two-way conversation - informant's words; my questions and comments. Sometimes informant saying nothing says much by pant­omime; at other times words are accompanied by acting to illus trate meaning . In either case I warn reader by frequent bracket [demonstrates], that informant is about to act (see Memphis dootor, p.1117, line 45) ; or I actually describe infor­mant's motions by parenthesis (see fantastic description of blood circulation by Dootor Lindsay of Richmond, p.944 , line 30 to p.946 , line 41 ; see also how I fol­low Dootor Caffrey of New Orleans, wh ile he dances up to the picture of St. Peter on his altar p.1464, lines 2-35). Like my Polklore Prom Adams County Illinois -abbreviated PACI -this new work offered to scholars and interested readers is a serious investigation of super­stition . Similarly both publications are collections of original material gath­ered orally among believers themselves . Both may be called journeys among people and into their minds. The newer journey begins . NEW JOURNEY - NEW METHOD PACI was an exhaustive search for general folklore within the few square miles of a small community , whereas the present study - confining itself to witchcraft and allied magic practice -covers a wide geographical are�; from New York City south through �lorida; west across the Gulf of Mexico to Mqbile , New Orleans and Algiers ; and north up the Mississippi River to Vicksb urg , Memphis and Little Ro ck. Algiers - called Hoodoos Town (p. 745, line 14) , over the river (p. 782 , last line) and aoross the river (p.769 , line 39) , being west side of river in New Orleans -has always been considered by many hoodoos a town separate from New Orleans. These journeys must be narrated later because they illus trate important problems and techniques , adding significance and interest to the text. Another difference between PACI and the present study -which I abbreviate HOODOO -are informants. Who were interviewed? PACI sayings and stories were given both by white and colored persons; amounts from each prob ably being in pro-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"II - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -portion to population - 20 to 1. This ratio is reversed in HOODOO -1605 Negroes . to 1 white man (p .5, No.8) - because collecting conditions in the Southern States advised me not to attempt the twof old or simultaneous operation I had used in Illinois; also because the beginning of World War II and gasoli ne rationing pre­vented me from working separately among white people. For the hoodoo-believer ratio between coZo�ds and whites -as one woman called them (p. 1155, line 6) -let us listen to the opinions of professional men and women engaged in hoodoo work: Zorro the Mentalist of Norfolk, Va., says: \"We do find in the South that 90 percent of Negroes is been trained tmder that hoodooism and 40 percent whites believe in hoodooism. \" (p .1163, line 29f.) Like Zo rro , the Memphis doctor who performed OPERATION SHOEPOLISH (p. 1567f .), makes an extreme statement: \"Yo' kin start right 'cross West Memphis bridge, git below West Memphis, and all de way into Little Rock - 135 mile ah think is de highway - yo' cain't hardly stop at a home but whut people don 't believe in hoodooism. \" (p. 1569, line 10f.) (Remember, my informant is talking about West Memphis and the roads before World War II! Everything then was primitive compared to what I saw in 1968 , while driving up the Mississippi River from New Or­leans to St. Louis .) Almost agreeing with ZOrTO is Faith Doctor of Little Rock , Ark., who says: \"Well, ah tell yo ' mah deah frien' , de white race, ah would give it an even break, 50 outa ev 'ry 100 ; an ' in de colored, 9 outa ev 'ry 10. \" (p. 1323, line 42.) Not so excessive as Zorro, a Blind Doctor of Florence, S. Car., says: ''Yo' take 7 outa 10 believes in it.\" (p .1535, line 40. ) After assuming that I am a white hoodoo doctor, a frequent assumption among informants, he continues with a valuable obversation about black and white doctors, black and white believers: \"Yo ' [and he means me] kin go tuh work now, [workin' on] white an ' black, de black will believe yo ' quicker den me but ah kin play mo' whites den you kin.\" (p. 1535, lines 46-47 .) Divine Healer, also of Little Rock , lowers the preceding estimates: \"All would say aroun' 40 percent - 40 percent of de people believes in hoodooism ••• white and colored 'cause dey come to mah office. for dat kinda mess. But ah tell 'em ah don't do dat.\" (p .1046, lines 41-46.) So me informants, like Root Se ller of Mobile Ala., do not mention percentages: [I ask during interview] \"(Well, how many white people believe in it?)11 \"Dere 's a-plenty of 'em believe in it j est like we colored - dat ' s de biggest thing they believes in , cunjuration. It's nuthin but a ism ••• if -­a man got a wife and she git sick, de fust thing he say, 'Somebody 's done somepin tuh mah wife,' or 'Somebody done somepin tuh me and ah lost mah job' [or] ' All done dis-and-dat.' [Then I] sell mo re John de Conker [a root, see p.593] 'en [then = than] evah. Dat' s de biggest seller ah got. And ah [even] sell it to - ef [if] Jedge [Judge Somebody 's] fool enough to buy it, ah let him have it .\" (p.12 , No. 11.) Madam Wiley of Memphis, also unconcerned about percentage, is inte rested only in the number of white believers: ''Mah trade is white. Ask ever'body yo' see.\" \"(Are there many white people in this business or not?)\" ''Yessuh, dere's some in it. Oh, it' s ten or twelve here. \" (p.1567 , line 3f.) Madam Collins, likewise of Memphis, states the problem in a different way :"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -III \"Dere is a 10tta people who don't know whut they talkin ' about -dere's mo' false pretenders den dere are real workers . It \"(That is what a woman down in New Orleans told me.)\" \"Dere so many fakes until when de real person come, dey are jis ' grabbed up an ' carried into jail. But when de real people come along dat chew don't know how to believe ' em .\" [What a statement! Within a few hours, I myself was a1mos t in jail!] \"It's de same way heah in dis city. It's so many people out wa1kin' de streets knockin ' on do's dat until de people who have homes an' private [hoodoo] business cain 't git any work. A co 'se [of course] we git plenty work from white people but we don 't git very much from colored people . The real doctors of this city dey do git cooperation from de white people , business people , because they are the people that needs them.1t (p .996, lines 37-49.) (Her ''we don't git very much [work] from colored peop le\" means colored people do not visit Madam Collins as often as whites do , be­cause colored people lack the money - not the belief. Remember, this was during the Great Depression before World War II .) Undercover Man of New Orleans answers my percentage question: \"(What percentage of the people do you say would believe very thoroughly in this sort of work?)\" ItWell , the majority is colored people, but we got right smart of white -right smart of 'em .1t (p.1672, line 15£.) \"(Is it dying down or is it sU11 about the same as it used to be?)\" \"Well, you take out in parts of Arkansas and Texas it's good yet. Some parts of Louisiana it ain't as good as it used to be on account of there so many grafters, you see . But you get in Mississippi and North Louisiana [work is still good]. You take Arkansas - they paid me as high as $60 for a toby.\" (p. 1672, line 17f.) (Toby = hand. For toby , see p.655£.; for hand, pp . 573-586.) Another New Orleans informant says concerning a cousin, Doctor Julius P. Caesar: \"So finally his eyes had taken [on] so, he went on to the Charity Hos­pital and - they have a good many white folks [at the hospital] believes in that, he was colored and he was well known there -and they treated his eyes .1t (p .1642, line 47f.) True , only 1 white man appears in this material collected in Southern States, and I have explained why (p.II, line 2) ; but I have in these volumes quoted 11 white believers from FACI -see HOODOO� pp . IV-VI ; 1-2, Nos .2-3; 348 , line 40f.; 349, line 7f. ; 372, No.977. How many white persons and what percentage accepted some form of witchcraft -secret belief, half belief, crisis belief - in Adams County , Illinois, in 1935? No one can answer that question . As a matter of fact, A STRANGE WORLD (pp .1-19) was selected, given section status and put at the beginning of the text to emphasize, t hat the HOODOO­CONJURATION-WITCHCRAFT-ROOTWORK combination was neither invention nor special prerogative of the Negro. The text opens with the death of a colored witch , followed by a detailed account of the death of a white wit ch - a woman of German origin . The white woman telling the second story is just as superstitious as the colored woman telling the first story. Besides examples of white believers and doctors given in A STRANGE WORLD and elsewhere in these volumes (references Later) , I will now name two white men who for 60 years or more were the most famous doctors on the Atlantic Coast: the fabulous Doctor Buzzard of Beaufort (Bu ' -fert), S. Car. , and Doctor Harris near Florence , S. Car . Doctor Buzzard , born before the Civil War and dead by 1888, was - as his name signifies - a symbolic scavenger of rotten or evi.l conditions."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"IV - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -That this work included healing is evident. Though Doctor Buzzard may not have originated them, he probably set the fashion for the title doctor (everywhere), queer personal name (p . 293), odd appearance (pp . 294-300) and isolated residence (p.30l). Was Doctor Buzzard succeeded by a white man? He certainly was followed from his death until my time by a lot of LittLe bLack BuzzardS (p . 14l7, line 2); one of whom I interviewed -see interview DOCTOR BUZZARD OF NORFOLK. Doctor Harris was well-known on April 3, 1909, when Doctor Nelson began to work for him (p .1600, line 6) . Court�m SpeciaList knew Harris from 1908 (p .1448 , line 43) and says he was the original Doctor Buzzard (line 45f.). I say to Courtroom SpeciaUst, \"I talked with one of the men that worked for Harrison (Harris)\" (line 49), probably meaning Nelson . Harris , who died 1926-1927 , was almost im­mediately succeeded by a wh ite man calling himself Doctor Harris (p.1044 , l ine l7f.). This is what caused the confusion between names Harris and Harris son (Harrison). Do read the remarkable story of Doator Harris (Harrison) and the Woman Who Go t Sanan li ed (p. 908f . ) • (Refs . for Doctor Buzzard: pp.89l-905, especially No . 3070, wh ich must be read; p.997 , line 48 to p.998 , line 8; p.1044; pp .14l6-l4l7; pp .1447-1448; p.15l5, t itle & comment; p.1526, title quotation; p.1S99 , line 44f.; cf.125S , line 7.)

Folklorist, anthropologist, ethnologist, sociologist and psychologist know that superstition influences the mind regardless of race, nationality or creed; that the person investigating this complicated subject is not \"making fun of\" or degrading the people investigated. Since a few general readers of these volumes may be unaware of these facts, let me explain what I mean by quoting a personal experience: After the publication of FACI in 1935, printed reviews and private comments by scholars were excellent -see Illustrations. The book was not sent to news­papers , but a copy presented to the Quincy Public Library immediately caught the eyes of a reporter who wrote an outstanding review -long, well done, fair - yet some of the material disturbed: \"Do you remember when you were a child, and you learned that thirteen was unlucky , that a black cat must never be allowed to cross your path ••• wh ile you may no longer believe these or the scores and scores of other superstitions you first heard as a child, there apparently are many Adams ·countyans who do , judging by the impressive volume compiled by •••• Listed according to subject, there are 10,949 items of folklore in Mr. Hyatt's volume, ranging from popular beliefs regarding weather and nature to Child­hood rhymes and rhymed riddles, and including downright voodoo beliefs , listed under 'Hoodoo and W.itchcraft.' While many will be recognized with a smile by readers who hear such beliefs expressed -usually humorously -nearly every day, there are many astounding items of dark and horrible be­lief, which , if still believed in Adams County today, equal the witchcraft beliefs of Pennsylvania witchcraft sects, or voodoo worshippers of Haiti.\" (HeraLd-Whig, Sunday , February 2, 1936 .)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraf t -Rootwork -A few of the'astounding items encountered by the reporter may have been the following ones.

Several examples of colored lights in the text -see p.73, lines 17-20 - indicate that for­merly some doctors put a chemical preparat ion in their buried or other obj ects to make them flare when burned .) \"A man out in the country went to town to buy several barrels of molas­ses. He had to p/ass an old woman's house that everyone called a witch. On his way to town when he went by, she had a large white towel hanging in the window and a large white kettle under the towel. On his way back this wo­man was at the window pulling on the towel just like sh e was milking.

'�ears ago I had a very dear friend. We both had the same amount of hens. One day I moved in with her. We sa id we would not have any trouble over the eggs. We put a curtain up across the kitchen.

My friend kept talking about the nineteen chickens, so I thought I would move and take my chickens before she got them. After I got moved, my chickens would just jump up and down all the time and die one by one. I told my husband she had my chickens bewitched. He said, 'I will fix her.' So he drawed her picture with her pipe in her mouth . It sure look like she was standing right there . My husband is a witch doctor and he did not have to take her picture to a white oak tree , he just spit tobacco juice in her eyes. Sev­eral weeks after that I met my friend and she could not see.

A few years before FACI appeared, a book of American superstitions treated the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -VII beliefs within as pieces of misinformation, quaint relics rapidly disappearing before the light of education. Unfortunately the problem is not that simp le . A person can be a scholar of international repute, possess vast stores of krtowl­edge, and yet believe fervently in every aspect of witchcraft. I speak of a well-known Englishman, who died only thirty years ago . His mental roadblock was the same one stifling my uneducated informants in these volwnes: \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" (E:codus 22:18.) During the past week I have been wondering whether my reviewer was still alive and watching televis ion as I was . For on the night of June 3, 1969, on channel 10 (also S) at eight Central time , I saw that excellent program FIRST TUESDAY. I had a surprise! Not shock. The only thing shocking me is man's inhumanity to man. There has been a revival of interest in witchcraft. No, not by the unedu­cated and underprivileged I usually interview ed, but by those who consider them­selves among the elect - college students. We were shown students of American University -Washington , D.C. - c onstructing magic charts and discussing beliefs. We were told ab out similar practices at Western Ma ryland University and a uni­versity in South Carolina. A professor of anthropology and a psychologist talked -the latter about the sense of p ower given by witchcraft. Students of a high school in Washington, D.C., also appeared on the program. Finally , or in between, we saw a group of girls in paj amas staring at a candle flame -some of them twittering, others a little frightened. None of these things are new among students . Fifteen years ago when we gave a party in our New York City apartment for the graduating class of St. Bernard's School (Episcopal) , Gladstone, N.J. , some members of the class were trying to hypnotize one another. Hypnotism is used by the hoodoo world -see Doctor Caffrey of New Orleans , p.1470, lines l-S. The United States and England are not the only countries in which witches still exist: \"Late yesterday, when I gave the manuscript for this interview to my stenographer, I did not know what tomorrow would bring forth. This morn­ing , Tuesday , April 22 , 1969, on television 's Today Show, I heard that 10 ,000 �itches and �2ardS in Italy were demanding public recognition of their profession by the government or else. They threatened to confuse parliament. One cynic replied that even fortunetellers and seers could not confuse what was already confused! And that word PUBLICITY in the title [PUBLICITY AND HEALING , p.l226] was chosen only several days ago!\" (Quoting myself in HOODOO , p.1237, lines 1-7 .) While examining the contents of a newstand re�ntly - J une 1969 - I picked up a number of advertisements which copyright laws forbid me to quote in full. Text words of common usage and a few short word-groups I italicize . Capitalized words are that way in the original. Brackets and parentheses as everywhere in these volumes, unless otherwise noted, enclose my words. My paraphrases of course lack the sales appeal of and explain more than the concise originals. Each advertise­ment, as you will- recognize , is directly related to this investigation -HOODOO: VOODOO DOLLS from Haiti are advertised -five of them, handmade [showing that great care was taken to infuse and preserve ] mystical power for good and eviZ. Each doll is dressed in a different color: red, black, yel low, green, pink ; symbolizing love , money, happiness , success, health. Fur­nished free with the dolls are pins [the purpose of which is not stated but can be guessed] and a brochure titled HOW TO VOODOO. [Advertisement ends.] [Doll , often called doll-baby, appears frequently in HOODOO (pp.S4, No .197; 398, margin title ; 549, No. 184l; 845 , No .2926; 1364, line 28f.; l36S, line 9f.). I use the word infuse because a doll with mystical power is a hand (pp.S19-669, especially pp.S73-S86) , a magic helper, which like a"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"VIII - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hy att Foundation -battery must be recharged. This recharging is done by infusing, pouring into or over the hand a liquid - whiskey , perfume, oil and other sub­stances. (Christian baptism by infusion is pouring holy water over the head.) The technical term for this pouring is fe eding (p. 578) the hand. The general reader should understand that a hand is a fetish, a captured or bribed spirit. Power, the spirit, was formerly given to a hand by a master of spirits, but in these days of db-it-yourself witchcraft (for this expression , see FACI , 2nd ed . , p.800) spirit mas ters are starving to deathl Spirits in HOODOO of course do no t actually drink or eat; they ab sorb the spirit of the liquid or food (for an offering or drink and food, see p.140l, title quotation) . My wor d dressed does not appear in the ad­vertisement. To dress is a technical term meaning to prepare magically and is always italicized in HOODOO. The advertisement says a doll in red sym­bolizes love, but the believer knows it confers love . With the possible exception of red under certain conditions, the symbolism given for the dolls is neither psychologically nor magically correct, as candle color symbolism will demonstrate (p .797f.). The use of pins is everywhere in HOODOO. ] BOOK OF LEGENDARY SPELLS. Offered here is an exciting collection of strange occult secrets, including rituals for money, power and health, and rites of voodoo, witchcraft and the three magics -white, black and cere­monial - hidden in supernatural and occult lore, all explained step-by-step so that you may learn how to use these materials , instPUfTlents, pObJders, oils , and potions. [Ce�monial magic is a new term to me - surely tauto­logical. ] LUCKY LODESTONES? Yes, says this advertiser whose brand is the same type the ancients may have used for drawing two obj ects together. [For this reason lodestones are sold in pairs - a he and she, though the adver­tisement does not mention sex.] Yet previously it was su ggested to the reader - surely you want to be successful in the/affairs of love and money. Re gardless of pObJerful claims made by others, continues this sales pitch , our lodes tones are ALIVE and GENUINE and of MAGNETIC FULL STRENGTH , but we make no supernatural claims and offe r these as curios only. [This latter statement to avoid the law has been printed so often, by so many c urio dealers , and for so many years, it can no longer be in copyright (see my comment following interview title , AGENT FOR CURIOS , in HOODOO , p.1075; also my reading aloud a curios sales sheet in the year 1937, p.1082, line 3f.).] These lodestones will be delivered to you in a red flannel bag. As a gift - just as it appears in the 6th and 7th BOOK OF MOSES -we include the aZZeged Talismanic SEAL OF LUCK.

This my seventh and last advertisement interested me most, because back in 1937 , I interviewed a CHRISTIAN READER -DOCTOR ENGLISH of Norfolk, Va. , p.1399 , line 36 . The use of Christian formulas and ideas in HOODOO is too wide­spread and complicated to discuss here.] Since the preceding advertisements are only a very small part of our material, I will delay until later the great question : What do you mean by the title Hoo doo -Conjupation -Witchcraft -RootllJork? Instead I will continue with the differences between FACI and HOODOO. Besides geographical exp ansion (p.I), narrowed subject matter (p .I), black and white believers and doctors (pp.II-III), and the nec essary digression about the local reception of FACI in February 1936 with examples of the offending material (pp.IV-VI), and the similar digression ab out the current (1969) belief in hoodoo and witchcraft (pp. VI-IX) - besides these, a fourth difference between FACT and HOODOO was the change from hand reporting to machine recording . These four changes were to cause unexpected problems and at times serio�s troubles;"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"x -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -but they finally produced HOODOO, a work totally different from FACI . What the problems and troubles were will appear as I proceed. Though these four changes will be postponed until we reach field work , I must say a few words here about machine re cording to blame it for my presence every­where in the text. Mechanical equipment freed me from or lessened many distractions : hot, cold, and damp weather, all unfavorable for field work; the neighbor who suddenly de­cided to visit informant, preventing the start of an interview or terminating it; the long drive only to find prospective informant not home; the next-door phono­graph or radio at high volume; children screaming outside the window ; streetcars and heavy trucks pass ing by in the city ; dog barking or rooster crowing under the house in the country . These and others we sh all meet in the text. Worst of the annoyances is what I call the co llector 's di lemma. On the one horn, someone tells you a wonderful treasure-hunting story and you ask him to retell it so that you can write it down; but never is the retold story the same . You choose the other horn, when someone says he has a treasure-hunting story, by writing down the very first word - only to discover later that you have wasted energy and time. The worthless story mechanically recorded you eliminate by marking the beginning and end on the cylinder measurement tab and crossing it out . Yet the di lemma will continue in other forms when we reach actual field work. Another benefit of mechanical equipment, it relieved me from the tiresome scribbling that had to be rewritten or retouched that night before becoming cold. Instead, I could now rest at night or replay cylinders to evaluate recording and worth . Thus many cylinders badly recorded or having doubtful material were set aside to be shaved and used again. All these and other reliefs permitted me to think during an interview and to participate in it. I could also concentrate upon the speaker: study him, follow his story carefully , seek details or ask for repetition . As a part of the con­versation - asking questions or making comm ents - I would now appear on almost every recorded page, making the material alive and p ersonal . Two persons were talking, talking about life; a third person listening , the reader. Personality - the living situation, the person interviewed as well as the material -my new approach to folklore field work needs an explanation; not only for HOODOO, but also because it affected and transformed radically the belated second edition of FACI. FA CI , after its appearance in 1935, had been praised by the foremost folklore journal in the English-speaking world; o ne of the praises being\", \"The book g ives a clear and impersonal picture of the daily life of the people •••• \" (For this British journal, Folklore, see IZZus., p. .) By impersonal the reviewer meant: ' (1) that FACI was not a piece of literature based upon folklore but straight folklore, a scientific investigation of superstition and associated beliefs; or (2) the author nowhere enters the text with any theory , comment or persona l anec­dote from the collecting field. This latter impersonality I violated in the sec­ond edition of FACI ! Most noticeable of these violations are the long erysipelas cure I have quoted in HOODOO (p. 372, No. 977) and the fishing experience (FACI, 2nd ed. , p.54l, lines 1-17). Moreover . that I also had intended an introduction for FA CI - similar to this one here for HOODOO -is proved by my NOTE for THE DEATH OF A WIT CH on page 918: \"This story I have explained in the Introduction.\" I failed to produce an intro­duction because the long illness and recent death of my wife, and the resumption and completion of FACI as a memorial to her left me exhausted; also my age and uncertain cataracts on my eyes warned against any delay . Later I learned that"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -I had been correct in planning the FACI introduction ; in assuming that persGps interested in folklore wanted to know something ab out field-work methods and perhaps vital experiences. For example, Herbert Halpert, on the faculty of Memorial University - St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada - wrote: XI '�our book (first edition) bas long been a stand-by for me in my folk­lore teaching [Nov. 19, 1965].\" And afterwards , \"I do hope you will finish your index some day . But what i miss even more is the absence of a descrip­tion of how you gathered your very remarkable collection . Couldn 't you find ti�e some day to write a description of how you got started on the proj ect and just wh at procedures you followed ••• ? Without it there is a very real gap in our knowledge about the his tory of folklore collecting , and particularly since you seem to have been one of the earliest American collectors to recognize the importance of collecting wherever possible a full description rather than merely a statement ab out a folk belief. This is particularly true in your sections on ghostlore and witchcraft [Feb . 22, 1966] . \" Another member of the same faculty, Richard E. Buehler, of the Department of Folklore, wrote: \"If you have the time and would be so kind, I would very much appreciate any information you would supply as to your collecting techniques, editorial problems, time expended, etc.\" [March 7, 1969.] Further Duncan Emrich , who will start a folklore class at American University this fall (1969), wrote : \"During the period when I was chief of the Folklore Section of the Li­brary of Congress (1945-1955), as well as at all other times since becoming acquainted with your book [first edition] , I have used it and enj oyed it greatly . It is a superb work [July 2, 1969] .\" Mr . Emrich is the first person , so far as I know , to mention the special qual­ity of the first edition of FACI; a quality improved and intensified in the sec­ond edition he has not yet seen . Because I shall somewhere describe in detail this special quality , I am quoting a copy of his following order: July 2, 1969 Dear Mrs . Fuhrman , I shall appreciate it if you will request the library to order two copies of: Harry M . Hyatt, Folklore from Adams County, Illinois, Western Printing and Lithography Co . , Racine , Wisconsin (1965) 920 pp .

Since y our depar ture [for Europe] I have made two expeditions to Illinois, each one of several weeks , and combined with my sister 's continued assistance , that collection has now grown to 2500 ex­amples . Much of this data has not been previously recorded. Actually my collection as it now stands is the third largest ever accumulated in the United States. Three or four years of further search will permit me to publish the most outstanding monograph upon American folklore. You under­stand all of this material is fast passing into oblivion . Moreover it is original; the book will be of permanent value •••• \"I mention my folklore effort here simply because I believe that in the long run this book will be more important than the plan which I discussed in my former letter [and was I right !] .

My early evaluation of uncompleted FACI actually announces the book as' a foreseeable solution of an impossible situation . This folklore work had to be written . Qualities mandatory for it were originality and worth . Out of self respect - now called a search for identity or purpose -I had to prove to myself that I was something more than a handyman ab out the Church . Several years before I had attempted the proof with a book that failed because I could not undertake the nec essary field work. To test whether such field work in the tropics was possible for me, my wife and I went to Cuba. The first night in Havana at the old Inglaterra the mosquitoes drove me out into the park where I sat until dawn. Next night we had mosquito netting over our beds but it was too late. That Sun� day after completing my sermon at the American Cathedral, I could scarcely get out of the pulpit. The well-known Doctor Agramonte [see CoZumbia EncycZopedia unabridged] was summoned to the hotel and I with dengue fever was, sent to the Anglo-American Hospital . As soon as I was well enough to travel, I was ordered out of Cub a -also to stay out of the tropics . Thus, instead of the contribution to knowledge I had planned, I released The Church of Abyssinia as a scissors-and­paste book . Two things can be said about the work. First, it was original , the first comprehensive description of this branch of the Eas tern Church . Second, though it produced no rave reviews , neither was it damned: 1I ••• le Dr. Hyatt nou� a donne un ouvrage palpitant d'interet, un precieux instrument de travail, une mine d'informations ••• juge sainement et forth objectivement des questions dogmat­iques ••• \" (review by Dom F. de Wyels in Irenikon, paru dans Ie No .2, mars-avril, 1930, pp. 242-246, D'Amay S/Meuse [Belgique]). Third - more about this later. A real problem greeted my return to The United States in 1926. Could I find Church work in New York City where my wife for good reasons had to live? Chicago and Cincinnati experience, and three visits to New York City and common report did not inspire too much hope. After my wife and I were settled, I asked Bishop Manning to receive me canonically from the Diocese of Southern Ohio , despite no offered work in his diocese. He answered, I�es, consider yourself attached to the Cathedral until such work is available .\" This personal relationship with the Bishop meant that I marched in the great processions, moved along the sanctuary rail with one of the chalices during Holy Eucharist and occasionally read a lesson at Evensong . Moreover there was special outside work for the Bishop."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -XIII Most interesting of it for the present purpose were my Sundays at the Churc�of the Holy Communion, a parish made important by its early Rector, William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796- 1877) -see CoZumbia EnayaZopedia. My first Sunday there I stood before a first-class choir and organist. The congregation? In front of me sat ten or fifteen persons ! Yes the Church of the Holy Communion was dead. , Alive only were the elderly Rector and endowment fund . But that night the nave was crowded. Some of the congregation had come from a great distance. All were there to hear the organ recital by our organist, Lynn Farnum - also official organist to the New York Ph ilharmonic Orchestra. Once before , in 1920, I had visited a parish surrounded by a dead neighborhood - I had stayed in the Parish House -St. Marks in the Bowery . The Rector, Norman Guthrie, had been one of my predecessors as assistant at the Church of the Advent, Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, Ohio . He was years ahead of the Church in trying to adjust to changing condi­tions . I mention his barelegged dancing girls and quarrel wi th Bishop M'anning in IIPictures for Alma.\" Finally , Bishop Manning asked me to preach several Sun­days at Christ Church , Yonkers, N.Y. This was a workingman 's parish originally built for persons from England who worked in the carpet factory. Surprised when the vestry invited me to become the Rector , I went to the Bishop. Yes , he hoped I would accept. No , he saw no reason why I could not continue living in New York City . I accepted, remained t hree years and resigned in 1930 to become the curate of my friend, John A.F. Maynard at the Church du St. Esprit in New York City . By doing this , I too, like Guthrie was years ahead of the Church . I became a wopkep­priest, supporting myself outside the Church - a practice now considered honor­ab le and often desirable by ecclesias tical authority, though as old as St. Paul the Apostle who made his living as a tentmakep (Acts 18: 2-3). Unlike St. Paul, I worked for a wife. Also I probably became the first curate of our Church to enter Who's Who in AmePiaa -accepted 1928 and appearing in the 1930-1931 edition, Vol.16, where I remained for twenty years, continuing on in Who 's Who in the East for a number of years . Yes, the third result of The Chupah of Abyssinia was Who 's Who in Ameriaa. Yet, The Churah of Abyssinia had little influence on FACI. The latter logi­cally developed out of my experience with Mi ZZeps of Mi ZZepsburg� Kentuaky , a family history published in 1929 -started when I was a boy , an earlier seapah fo p iaentity. In both books I wrote about people and land I knew . MMK was m erely a small family tree of a colonial family , who for three gener­ations were pioneers on the western frontier; in Peqnsy1vania, then Kentu cky and finally Missouri. Further work through the years has greatly increased the orig­inal material. It all began because my grandfather James Martin Miller -born at Millersburg in 1829 -told me a story during my childhood about his grandfather's sister being killed at the family stockade by Indians (MMK p.27). In 1921 my future wife and I drove down from Cincinnati (I was then at St. James, Columbus , 0.) to Millersburg to visit the grave of my grandfather's grandfather -my great­great grandfather - John Miller , founder of Millersburg. More gene alogical jour­neys together followed. They eventually turned into folklore ones.

Why cl1.d I use"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"XIV - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -it with its cylinder form instead of the flat-disk type of recording? Material could be marked off on the measurement tab parallel to NEW YORK CITY the cylinder; the good numbered and preserved, the worth­less as well as inconsequential duplicates scratched out and eliminated. Transcription would be easier. PAUSE AND PREPARATION After the publication of the first edition of FA CI, I had some material left ov er from field work d one during July , 1935 in the northern part of Adams County . What to do with it I had no idea. Moreover, I was out of work until I could think up a worth-while quest. To at­tempt another FACI elsewhere would have been a waste of time. As consequences of these two problems, I decided first to continue temporarily the Adams County col­lecting, and second to experiment with the possibility of confining myself to a witchcraft investigation. This twofold plan offered an insurance policy. If I failed with witchcraft, I might find enough new material in Adams County to issue a revised edition of FA CI. My wife and I prepared for our first witchcraft journey by sailing , April 23 , 1936, on the Bremen for England, where we saw The Ring at Covent Garden, seven plays of Shakespeare at Stratford-on-Avon, and discovered Portmeirion in Wales. Of course we stopped to revisit former shops and scenes at Oxford where we had been married and had lived. I had two folklore adventures wh ile ab road. One afternoon I purposely had a drink at the Shakespeare Hotel in order to engage the bartender in a casual con­versation about superstitions. (We were staying outside the city at the WeI combe or Trevelyan[ ?] the his torian's former home.) \"Do bartenders have any good or bad-luck beliefs , tI I asked? What he answered I no longer remember. But soon he remarked, ''Why , we have witches here in Stratford.\" That word witch in modern England surprised me . \"All these actors you are seeing go to them , they are the most superstitious people on eart h,\" he continued. What did witches do? Well they told fortunes, gave charms, sometimes had cures and things of th at sort. Then I ventured that recent Englishmen had written few books about popular beliefs and rites of their country. Why ? He did not know about books , but any Englishman capable of writing such a book would be too superior to learn much from his in­formants if he could find any . Whether the latter part of that is true I do not know. The corollary soon followed, \"But you could do such a book in England.\" Whether that was true I do not know. Was he pulling my leg? I rather doub t it . No, he did not know, never knew, I had published a folklore book ; and he could see that I was a clergyman not talking down to him. Finally he offered to list what superstitions he could, if I wanted them. I was delighted , would call for them day after tomorrow, and gave him a good tip . His list I saw just two weeks ago . My second folklore adventure was indirectly caused by Clough Williams-Ellis, Welsh architect and creator of Portmeirion , a fairyland on the coast of North Wales - telegrams and telephone (28) being Penrhyndeudraeth . Having read his book on architecture , and autobiography The Arahiteat, before leaving London or along the way , I asked for autographs when I reached Portmeirion . During our conversation he suggested his nearby ancestral home, a special p iece of old country architecture , would interest me and gave us a note to show his caretaker. I asked whether the house had a ghost and received the answer I had hoped for. ''No ,'' he said, \"but I can introduce y ou to a witch.\" (Neither he nor anyone knew that I was a folklore collector until after I had departed from Portmeirion .) Th� old stone house was a treasure, g rowing naturally out of the landscape . I found the witch's home, knocked on the door but recei ved no answer. As I was returning to the car a man came out the adjoin ing building , \"If you want to see"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Ro otwork -my sister, she's not home, the old devil.\" My clericals may have prompted Ms next remark, \"Did you know she was a witch?\" We let him talk awhile and then lef t. xv I cannot leave Portmeirion and end our fourth trip to Wales without mention­ing two charming men; the poet and dcamatist , Robert Nichols, and a man whose name I no longer remember . He was not the painter , Augustus John, who was fre­quently there . I have a feeling that he belonged to the world of music because, after we had talked ab out the New York and London theatre, the hobo poet , William Henry Davies (I recently had been reading his poetry) , Lafcadio Hearn (because Nichols had taught English Literature at the Imperial University of Tokyo, Japan) , and other matters, and finally turned to recent phonograph recordings (a field in wh ich I was out of date) , my unremembered companion became brilliant. I actually took notes for records to buy . As soon as I returned to New York City , I rushed to that old mecca -The Gramophone Shop, 18 East 48th Street. Even before the experiment with the first 11 persons interviewed (see last 4 lines on p.XIII) I knew that exploratory journeys to find living witchcraf t would be quite a task. Everything ab out such an investigation looked uncertain . What actually was out there? Anything ? I had started FACI with t wo of my three basic problems more or less already solved. First, I would work in a small community I knew, one person passing me on to another. Second, I had a logical outline of the subject matter wanted: weather, plants, animals, birth and infancy , human body , folk medicine, dreams , wishes, love beliefs and rites, marriage, clo thing and dressing , household ac­tivities, social relations, death , spirits , and witchcraft which is based upon spirits. For example , if I found a weather saying, all I had to do was to place it under the concealed margin titles of weather -such as sun, moon, staps , etc. , (see first few pages of FA CI) . Many margin titles of course, like those under Folk Medicine, are pr inted for easy reference . This method of internal indexing meant that a final manuscript was ready for typing any minute. The third basic problem merely required the finding of the material. Everything about HOODOO -CONJURATION - WITCHCRAFT - ROOTWORK would be differ­ent . Its conglomerate nature made it difficult to grasp as a whole . Not until the very end did I manage to devise some sort of workable if not logical order. New techniques for collecting material had to be sought . A few of the problems confronting me I knew from the start. First, where should I search for material. My field of inquiry would be down the Atlantic coast from Maryland through Florida, because here were comf,ortable and interesting places where my wife could a ccompany or join me summer or winter. She had had a rugged time with me on that July 1935 trip to Adams County (see lines 6-8, p.XIV) . Our hotel in Keokuk, Iowa , w as more than fair and the food good, but the heat during field work had been stifling . We sweltered - stewed in the steaming bottoms along the Mississippi , baked on the tops of the river bluffs. We always carried sandwiches, drinking water, and other equipment which after the first day included several large towels for each of us . Unfortunately the primitive air-conditioning of our club car from St . L ouis to Keokuk and beyond had not yet reached hotel rooms and au tomobiles. The second problem - among whom down the coast should I work also had been solved. To interview wh ites and blacks at the same time , as I had done in Adams County, appeared unwise and impossible in the South ; therefore I decided to begin with blacks because of their special concentration in or near cities , or in coun­try districts. I studied the large two-volume U.S. Census records for the se fig­ures , but it was a waste of time. Only out in the field does one gradually be­come aware of problems and produce some of the solutions . Blacks were Chosen for"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"XVI - M emoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -another reason . I h ad had both ghetto and slum experience in Chicago; the former Church work , the latter non-sectarian social service . The ghetto experience occurred in St. J ohn 's Evangelical Italian Mission of the Episcopal Church ; the Priest-in-Charge being Joseph Anastasia , born Messina, Italy , 1883. He , previously having been in the Presbyterian ministry , entered the Episcopal Church and created this Chicago mission, 1912-1921. Later he worked for years in the Diocese of Newark (New Jersey - information from his biograph­ical sketch in The Clerical DirectopY of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, 1962) . I became involved at the mission because Alfred Kolkebeck , my former roommate at temporarily revived Racine College (Wisconsin), decided to return home to Chicago for his theological training - in other words both of us were now at the Western Theological Seminary , present Seabury-Western\" Theological Seminary of Evanston , Illinois. Ko lkie happened to be an extreme high churchman and a ceremonialis t. The mission gave him a chance to express himself. I since 1915 had been a Postulant for Holy Orders on my way to the foreign mission field. Was I trying to widen my experience among an unknown people? Our services were south-Italian-Roman with additions and sub tractions by the team of Anastasia & Kolkebeck. And the congregation of complete families with babies crying , children eating , everyone jesticulating , talking or moving about - well, it appeared very un-EpiscopaUan; but probably very Christian in the primitive-Corinth ian-Church way . Do not misunderstand me . They were simple, hard-working and honest people, but different. I would understand them bet ter after I had worked among the blacks of New Orleans . What do all those private altars and religious organizations I found there mean? That non-seatarian social semae means I became a member of Chicago Red Cross staff as a field secretary for returning veterans. Here was a supervised, de­manding job, but not an overpaid one . We had a career business woman who super­vised \"us , all men , our department occupying one floor of the building . There were also several assistant-supervisors . You did not run to the supervisor or an assistant-supervisor every time you had a little problem , you first talked it ove1 with any secretary available. Remember, more than half these men were always out working in their districts . Each secretary had a district in Chicago, his own desk, files , and he shared a s tenographer from a pool. My district adjoined the so-called blaak belt on the South Side ; in fact some of the blacks spilled over into my district . There was the reason why the black-belt secretary 's desk aqd mine were adjacent. We could talk ov er mutual problems . What sort of work did we do? A ve teran from my district comes in to make an application for assis tance ab out all sorts of things - back pay , job, lost wife, etc. If I am absent, an­other secretary or an assistant-supervisor will interview him. If I am present I will fill out the preliminary case sheet , which includes his name, age , birth­place, service identification , address , available telephone number, where he worked b efore entering the service , etc. I mus t list every possible piece of information I can ob tain . Then I ask him to sit in the waitingroom . Meanwhile I study the case before going to an assistant-supervisor for a c onsultation. He may suggest further data I missed, therefore I briefly reinterview the applicant . Or he may reject the application , in which circumstance I tell the applicant the assistant-supervisor will see him. But if the application is accepted, Iso tell the veteran , adding that he will be notified when to re turn for the final deci­sion. And then I start to work out in the slums . We had some general rules , though I remember only a few of them. You kept a time sheet , itinerary and ex­pense account for the day , calls made and reports. These you wrote up , attached to the case sheet and dropped into the stenographer's basket on your desk so that they could be typed into the case history . You rarely started out on a s ingle"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -XVII case, but had other uncompleted cases in your notebook to save backtracki n&. Why visit the same street or block twice , if you could do it all at one time . Though I never felt in danger, all of us realized that the work could be dangerous . Here are a few of the precautionary measures I remember. Identify yourself at once. Watch for the drunk and the person you thought was doped or perhaps a little weak-minded. Never pass anYbne on the stairs , especially a woman. Never stand exposed at the bottom of a stairs well, someone above co uld drop a heavy weight upon your head. Never enter a room , interview out in the hall. Have you , ever been in a delapidated tenement in the slums ? Visit one sometime . Without the Chicago training I c ould never have worked in New Orleans, Algiers, Memphis and Jacksonville . There is much more - the splendid (for their day) social ser­vice records kept by Western Electric, the night we waited for a race riot that never happened or reached the newspapers -but enough. At times I had to get away from it all -the routine chapel services and the gruelling intellectual work, half of it , like dogmatic theology, pastoral theology and homiletics , out-of-date and unrelated to a rapidly changing world . Even ac­tivities in church and social service , in anything, wi ll sometimes pall . The spirit s uffers from claustrophobia, occasionally needs elbow room in order to breathe. To supply this want I developed my own spiritual exercises : (l) three nights a week Campanini conducting orchestra and Singing stars , Mary Garden , Galli-curci , Rosa Raisa, Claudia Muzio , Muratori, Baklan off, all of them I can remember; (2) on Saturday or Sunday afternoon, Ysaye and Spaulding , Godowsky and Shattuck ; Walter Hampden and Ben Webster, all I remember for the moment; and (3) several times when free tickets came to the seminary , Stock and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. I was not yet accustomed to symphony orchestra and chamber music. Yet my one great gift from Chicago did originate in the seminary - a civilized view of the Bible and religion . That view was given to me by our Old Testament man, Samuel Alfred Brown Mercer (Harvard and Ph.D. , Munich) , and New Testament man, B urton Scott Easton (Ph.D., Pennsylvania) , who were masters of higher crit­icism . In 1916 , Mercer introduced me to the Golden Bough, and Easton, to The Quest of the Historiaal Jesus -these some y ears before Frazer and Schweitzer became public names. From them I learned that the Bible is not a book of magic, or a crystal ball revealing present and future events , or a collection of texts to prove anything you wanted to believe ; but a collection of books to be studied by scientific methods and judged by the time in which each was written. This knowledge was the greatest preparation I carried into the folklore field. Mercer, of course, became my greatest friend and is mentioned in \"Pictures for Alma.\" MARYLAND - THE EASTERN SHORE OCEAN CITY - BERLIN -TYREE CHURCH The term Eastern Shore includes that pa�t of Maryland east of the Chesapeake Bay and the Virginia counties of Accomac and Northampton . Sometimes all of Delaware is included, making the term equivalent to the Delmarva [Delaware-Maryland-Virginia] Peninsula. The Maryland-Virginia definition I write about - both the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coas t sides - was one of the wonders of the world. The word wonder should be applied to the coast all the way down south through Florida. Within the last 34 years have modern roads, increase in automobiles, and the Great American Crowd ruined this former natural beauty and wonderland? See my note about the Gulf coast 30 years later. My wife Alma and I start from New York City . \"Left Aug . 14th , Friday , 1936 -2 hrs . to Cranberry [N.J.] -Weber's Hofbrau [for lunch] , Camden , N.J., at 12: 30 - very hot all day - road dusty on U.S. 130 due to repairs between Camden & Brownsville Ferry - ferry left"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"XVIII - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -minute after we arrived, just as it did 2 years ago -ab out 241 miles to Ocean City [from N.Y.C. ] -Hotel Atlantic, wooden building, 2 small rooms 251 & 253 - food served in dining room good - s poke to waiter [Jerry Williams] about folklore - no colored people in Ocean City - [those at hotels] come from Washington & Baltimore to work - [but] colored peop le in Berlin.\" \"Sat . drove over to Berlin - picked up old colored man in street in Berlin who took us [chauffeur and me] out to the church [Tyree Church] -they were getting ready for a camp meeting [revival service) -dilapidated church -prea cher from Baltimore - benches and pulpit outside , close to­gether, unp1aned boards . Interviewed old man in church -mosquitoes [in church] - made arrangements for Tuesday [from Numbers Book No .1, informants 12-14] .\" [Arrangements I no longer understand . The old man was No .12, Samuel Forman, who is probably someWhere in the text.] During luncheon I told my wife we would attend the camp meeting early that afternoon . What was in store for us we could see and hear as we approached the small cemetery near the church . Emotions were already in action . A lone woman stood at a grave , screaming and waving her arms. Samuel Forman that morning had thought our attendance at the meeting quite all right. Now seeing a lone wh ite man across the road from the church , I asked him about our presence . He agreed with Forman. We passed through the gate , my wife dropping a free-will offering into the box , and walked towards a large crowd under the trees. The people , three or four rows deep, enclosed an open circle. At one edg e of it swayed the evangelist exhorting us to accept God, around the other edges were men kneeling and beating the ground with large switches and flat clubs, and in the center rolled a man and a woman groaning . Soon a third man threw himself on the ground and began to writhe . And all the while the surrounding crowd softly hummed or clapped hands. Underlying everything pulsed the beat,a fascinating rhythm. Here was the release of inhibitions and a manifesta tion of the spirit as old as relig­ion. The revival would continue on into the night. This was not Broadway, t his was primitive man. I was awe d. We soon left. On the way out I asked the white man, surely from the sheriff's office , ab out what happened at night . He said some of the young men were already drinking and that there could be trouble . This falling to the ground or rolling is a form of the old sacred dance, comes in many varieties (cf. the dance m ania of the Middle Ages) , being phenomena com­mon to black and white , and where periodically practiced the modern participants are often called holy �lleps (I mention them somewhere in the text) . There is a vast literature about all these spiritual exercises -speaking with tongues, seeking martyr dom , mutilation , flagellation, etc. Let me quo te briefly one of the classic accounts ab out wh ite men: \"The great meeting at Cane Ridge [Bourbon , Co ., Ky .] corranenced on a Friday before the third Lord's Day of August, 1801. From the commencement the roads were literally crowded with wagons , carriages, horsemen, and people on foot, all pressing to the appointed place , until by the Sabbath Day the grove that was then open near Cane Ridge meeting-house, was filled with wagons , tents and people. It was supposed that there were between twenty and thirty thousand people present. Elder Stone in his journal remarks - 'From the very commencement, an uncommon solemnity ap peared to rest on the countenances of the people. Not unfrequent1y several preachers would be speaking within the bounds of the encampment without any interrup­tion to each other. Wagons , stumps and logs were used for stands.

The whole quotation comes from W.H. Perrin, History of Bourbon, Scott, Harrison and NiahoLas Counties Kentuaky , Chicago, Ill., 1882, pp .48-49 . I italicized the words. The fa lling ex ercise and later the jerks spread in all directions.) Ocean City was not too bad for a start out into the unknown world. I had picked up a man on the streets of Berlin to guide me to Tyree Church where I interviewed him, and I had found Jerry Williams a nearby school teacher to act as contact man. Tentative arrangements were made with him for another visit before the end of the year. I did my interviewing in our second hotel room. After leaving Ocean City, we drove to Cape Charles, OLD POINT COMFORT, VIRGINIA Va. , where we took the ferry across the entrance to WARRENTON, VIRGINIA Chesapeake Bay (a long bridge has now eliminated the ferry) to Little Neck on the mainland of Virginia. From there we drove to Norfolk, taking another ferry to Old Point Comfort, where we stayed at Hotel Chamberlain on the bay. Here the head wa iter acted as my contact man, sending men up to our living room to be interviewed. I also interviewed several persons on the street by hand. After we had been there a week, my wife m ade a discovery - her sister and husband had also been in the hotel for a week. The discovery was made when the two women met in the state liquor store! That is not all . Our chauffeur had seen the sister from a dis­tance on each of these days, but assumed we knew she was there. On our way back north we evidently stayed at the old Jefferson Hotel in RiChmond, had luncheon at Hotel Stratford in Fredericksburg, and continued on to Wa rrenton for the night. While at Stratford, where we had had luncheon on several other trips , I made arrangements with Carter to act as a future contact man . At the hotel in Warrenton I first met the fear that I might be a detective or a hoodoo man ! Our waiter agreed to talk to me after dinner. Nine o'clock and no"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"xx -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -waiterl I went downstairs and found him. Several of his contributions are in the text . As I said in the PREFACE , in this work you fight for everything . On the way to Fredericksburg , I interviewed the porter of FREDERICKSBURG � VA . my Pullman car , called Man on the Train, [informant) No. 37, who gave me 2108, p.6ll. This rite I would hear in many variants from several hundred persons later, almost everywhere. I stayed at the Stratford , where I did all my interviewing, except on two nights when I visited families in their homes out in the c ountry. Several episodes I recall. One night after dinner my contact man Carter brought to my room an elderly man to be interviewed. I was still using the Ediphone, meaning I had to repeat into the speaking-tube every word or phrase spoken by the informant. Such an tiphonal action of course soon became m onotonous , producing a sing-song ritual. The fol­lowing morning the man from the room adjoining mine , said at breakfast to one of the waiters, \"You won't believe this , but last night I heard two men in the next room praying . The sound was sort of interesting but I could not understand a wor of it.1I I met here a waiter who worked on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, who had a title that has or will soon become obsolete . He was the Assist ant Superin­tendent of Education , Spotsylvania Co ., Va. , for Colored People . These may not have been the exact words of the title, but he was top education man for his people-:ld a good one . Good also was the headwaiter, a nephew of Carter's only 29 ye ars old, but 6 feet 6 inches tall, who. ran an excellent hotel restaurant. RETURN TO MARYLAND SNOW HILL - BOXIRON - GIRDLETREE - S TOCKTON ST. JAMES - DEAL ISLAND - PRINCESS ANNE This trip is outlined in Numbers Book , No.3, informants 83-134, and I remember much of it very well. Here begins the great change in collecting methods . After the Fredericksburg trip I traded the Ediphone in for a Telediphone having a micro­phone. But instead of the light-weight Ediphone , I now had two large heavy cases, recorder and amplifier , adding to my transportation problem . There were still the former specially-made container holding 50 cylinders - built like a suitcase with a handle - and my considerable personal luggage. \"Friday , Dec. 4th [1936) left N.Y.

This means that Ocean City , the whole Eastern Shore is many more times accessible today . Whether we traveled the prim­itive beach road to save time or passed through Snow Hill, I no longer remember. All this land is low-lying and fertile - in my day a great tomato country with a cannery at Snow Hill. There were still few cars in 1936 -roads could be muddy and somet imes sandy towards the water. Whether before or after we interviewed Mr. and Mrs . John S. Douglas (87, 88) , we briefly went out into the old dunes covered with pines to look out upon Chincoteague Bay . Even in the cold damp Last Light it was glorious ! Was that outer beach ever turned into a national monument? Chincoteague oysters , fish, ponies, duck blinds - a world apart, then. Now? ''Went to Girdletree - called on Miss Steele .\" Under her number (91) I have note \"smallpox item.\" This is not 1165, p.425, from \"Boxiron , Md ., by hand.\" All items from small communities or out in the country had to be taken down by hand.

[This means I did not return to my hotel in Berlin until 1 A.M .] Trip for day rather cold - thermo at 4 P.M. 340, heavy frost.\" Sunday, I again interviewed at the Douglas home in Snow Hill, beginning with Mr . Douglas (92) and ending with (101) . Monday , Jerry taught school. After school we drove to Deal Island to make arrangements for work there on Tuesday . After di nner, probably at Pocomoke City , we went out to St. James, a Negro country district nearby. I remember two of these homes very well, though one of them I did not enter. First came Mr. and Mrs . Purnell Dennis (102 & 103) in their 70 's, whom I do not recall. Next I interviewed the elderly Mrs . Ward (104) . Her radio having broken down she wanted Jerry's advice. As soon as Jerry turned the cabinet about , the cause of the trouble became apparent . The impressive shell held an instrument the size of your hand and it was battery powered. Jerry gave the correct diagnosis , \"Your bat tery is dead.\" Another social prob lem awaited us at the next home - a young married couple Jerry knew well, he having taught them. Jerry blew his horn several times , called out his name and then their names, asking them to come down. We could see a lamp burning upstairs. '�aybe they're not home,\" I sug­ges ted. \"They 're home all right ,\" he answered. After awhile we drove away. Then it happened -the car disintegrated somewhere . Fortunately we were either in Pocomoke City or Salisbury -the latter I believe . I reached my hotel in Berlin at 2:30 A.M. So s·tates Numbers Book No.3. Before I forget, a few days later Jerry told me what had happened at the last house. The young man and his wife had recognized Jerry ' s VOice , but they couldn't make up their minds whether it was Jerry or some spirit imitating him. The spirit won the decision . ''Were they kidding you,\" I asked. \"I wish they had been, but that is another one of our social problems,\" he replied. (For this problem see 12, p.llf.) Despite my few hours sleep , Jerry picked me up before school Tuesday morning and drove me to Deal Island. I w ould work in the home of Mr . and Mrs . Melvin White. He was a cooper, making barrels for oys ters , and he was also the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"XXII -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -Republican leader for the district. There were three sons - Albert 15 years old , George and Melvin , Jr . The first persons interviewed were Mr. White and then his wife, so that they would know what I wanted and what to tell people. (A Deal Island note, Numbers Book No .3, says Bayhan, a wh ite high man or hoodoo doctor -see p.89l - lives 3 miles from Eas ton, Md .) For the first and only time I inter­viewed a number of children on Deal Island - nothing ab out witchcraft, jus t good and bad-luck things . You do no t start out collecting witchcraft; you work into it gradually , feel­ing your wa y. Among my wife's papers I found an impressive list of uncomfortable nights we had had during our travels . Well, Deal Island was one of my alone bad nights. The Whites were not at fault; but that penetrating , cold, damp December air of the Chesapeake . As I entered that up stairs guest room , it was like walking into a refrigerator. No, there was no heat. Even downstairs had only one small stove at night. I began with paj amas, leaving my socks on and putting over them a pair of woolen socks . To these I added a sweater, my bathrobe , and a pair of heavy Scotch woolen gloves. Only the football blanket I carried for an emergency re­mained. Should I lay it under or over me? I jumped into bed only to jump out later to spread the floor rug on top of everything. Nothing worked. I had a miserable night. Downstairs next morning the glowing coal stove looked and felt wonderful, as I dressed in front of it . Yes, I came down in my bathrobe holding my clothes -a trick I, like many others my age, had learned during childhood. Almost better than the hot stove was the breakfast Mr . White and I sat down to , the piece de resistance being pig ears -something I had not eaten for years. There must be a special way of cooking them, because they were delicious. \"Had you ever eaten with a black man before ,\" you ask. In some form or other someone is going to ask for a full explanation. Here it is . My grandfather , James Martin Miller (see p.XIII) and his father James Miller, both born in Millersburg, Bourbon Co., Ky . , were slave owners -see original census records of Lewis Co., Mo ., for 1850 and 1860, at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. My mother, born 1855, who played with slave children , was a bitter opponent of slavery even as a small child. Somehow she overheard a little gossip she was not supposed to hear -someone telling how my mother's relative had killed a slave woman. According to my mother 's story, this man as a punishment had put the slave woman in an earth cellar under some out-building to stay the night. Next morning they found her dead from exposure. My grand­father said my mother was too young to understand what had happened, that the woman had died from natural causes [I] or heart failure [I]. My mother never liked this branch of the family , though I personally knew them as wonderful people. I knew three of my greatgrandfather 's slaves, Martha Miller , Frank Henderson and his much older sister, Sue Miller. Frank, as a growing boy, renamed himself Henderson because he liked his boss. Two of these three are mentioned in my Desoondants of John Walton of Baltimore County MaryZand and Harrison County Kentucky, New York, 1950, p.16. Martha , about my mother's age , moved to Quincy , Illinois, and when I first met her lived on the west side of 10th Street in a nice house south of the alley between Chestnut and Cherry . My mother, and I as a child, often drove by so that they could talk o ver old times. If I rememb er correctly, her married name was Morris. Years later her daughter, w ho married and lived on a farm out in the county near Fowler or Paloma, contributed folklore sayings to FACI. Frank and his sis ter Sue, I first saw ab out 1915 .

When I said to her, \"I am Fannie Miller's son,\" all she could answer was , \"Ole Marse Miller,\" with mumblings. Frank , a small boy when the Civil War began, I have described in my Walton history . My closest relationship to a black man began before I can remember. Al Carver came to us when he was about 16 , as a utility man - horse and buggy and stable, cutting grass or raking up leaves , shov eling snow , or carrying in wood and coal and removing ashes. He lived at home but ate his noon meal in our kitchen -summer-kitchen in summer. I often ate with him or sat and talked to him while he ate. Let me qualify these statements. Al worked for us when he was not work­ing for the county or city. In fact, my first social service activities began while visiting him at work . I remember the basket of Easter eggs my grandfather and I carried to him in the county jail. The iron bars , everything impressed me. On another occasion we took him a basket of food. This required a long street­car journey including a transfer, from our home on the southwest corner of 6th and Cedar to the city workhouse. \"What are those chains about your a nkles ,\" I inquired? These were my first shackles. Years later I would see them on chain gangs along a few main roads of the South , but each y ear as northern tourist and automobile increased they were pushed farther and farther back into the hills. I last saw the road gang , unshackled, in 1968 while driving along the gulf coast road of Alabama. Since the men were on my side , I slowed down to pass them. First came the guard, the only one along the line . Just as I approached the final man , I gave him a sharp hand salute. He was so surprised he could return only a one-finger salute. He could not know that in saluting him I also had saluted the few ex-chain-gang men I had interviewed. During the d ay or that night I am sure he said to some of his companions, \"Did you see that priest who passed us? He saluted me.\" What priest? Who cares. Among his own people Al was called the meanest nigger in town; among us he was considered the salt of the earth. Yet he had one fault, a temper, a nd he lived up to his name, carver -handy with a knife. Al was also handy with his fingers, being the greatest rag­time player I ever heard. After leaving us he played in dives, anywhere, his territory being St . Lo uis, Kansas City and Denver. He last returned home for a few days and called on us about 1910-1911. Whether he ever made ragtime history I do not know. Why St. A lbans Chapel of the Episcopal Church had been built years before out on The Prairie in the middle of nowhere, neither the Bishop of Quincy, I, nor anyone else could guess. In any case, I was now out there at Bishop Fawcett's request studying the sparsely settled neighborhood to determine whether the old brick building could be reopened for religious use. This survey I made in 19l? while attending summer school at Culver-Stockton College twenty miles away and commuting home weekly . Adjoining the chapel to the west was a row of nicely kept Negro homes, representing the first large break away from what we today call the black ghetto. Homes and chapel were isolated several blocks from the nearest white neighbors. Sidewalkless dirt roads served as streets. Public utilities were lacking . I suggested to the Bishop that white people would not crowd the Negroes by building too near them; that a new type of Negro home-owned community would develop round this initial nucleus and chapel . The bishop agreed with me. If the Negroes could use the building , he would permit them to hold their own services there under liberal conditions - provided I found funds for restoration . These funds I ra ised and the walls I painted, but the floor scrubbing I turned over to others . We opened with a mixed congregation of twelve or more whites and a larger group of blacks including children . The whites included my father, niece and a young woman she knew - the two latter still living . Surely this must have been among the first mixed congregations in the Episcopal Church - I mean"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"XXIV - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -the blacks not sitting in the back row or up in slave gallery. I will print a picture of that congregation standing at the chapel entrance , if I can find it before publication . There were five or six servic es before I left for the theo­logical seminary in Chicago . What happened after my fteparture I no longer remem­ber. The old chapel has disappeared, but blacks still live there on Spruce Street between 20th and 22nd. And would you believe it - they are completely surrounded by Whites. How wrong I had been! But through these years even my mistakes were right , though not the present one - I have talked too much , exhausting allotted space, and must now confine myself to a few essential high spots. As Duncan Emrich has suggested, after I have had a little rest, I am going to disc uss tech nicalities with a tape recorder. After I resigned from the Red Cross staff - I mean resigned because the director liked my work and wanted me to remain -I spent my third and final year at Bexley Hall, the divinity school of Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio. Last year the name and school were transferred to New York State to become part of a uni­versity system. Two years after my graduation, Me rcer followed me to become Dean of Bexley, stayed a year and continued on to Trinity College, University of Toronto, where he remained. For the first time in my life, without church work and the tenseness and the glamour of Chicago, I was living the life of a quiet country gentleman behind those second and third windows, to the right of that oriel window over the main entrance - Canon Watson's living room. The day of graduation I met for the first time a man who , if I were either superstitious or very religious, could have been a special messenger from God. The Rev. Lee Baird of Chillicothe , Ohio, had returned to Kenyon for the exercises. He asked me where I expected to work. I told him I had been offered Thermopolis, Wyoming, but had refused it. Then came the special message: \"Why don't you stop in Cincinnati, making it a roundabout way to St. Louis on your way home? Dunlop at The Church of the Advent, Walnut Hills, is looking for an assistant.\" Of course I had heard of Dunlop and the church. At least by traveling a few extra miles I could see a new city. Without telephoning Dunlop to see whether the position was still open, I left Gambier that afternoon, changed trains at Columbus , reached the old Union Station late at night , walked across the stre et to the Grand Hote l and by sheer Zuck ap­proached the desk just as a man unexpectedly had to check out - this giving me the only room left in town because of the racing season . Next morning I tele­phoned Dunlop, telling him about Baird. He said , \"Come on up .\" Dunlop knew nothing about me, except I came from broad-churchmanship Bexley Hall, had been recommended by Lee Baird, and was rather young for the job - the latter perhaps something in my favor , being no possible competitor. \"I am leaving on a nine-weeks vacation the last Sunday in June, \" he began , \"and up until the last minute there is so much to be done I can not be fair to you or to me by formal interview. Instead , suppose for several days you follow me about , w atching me work, hearing me explain it. Meanwhile you may want to ask questions or tell me something ab out yourself. Today and tomorrow we will have luncheon together , tonight you will dine with us at the re ctory to meet my wife and children.\" Dunlop sprang a little surprise the second day . \"As you know,\" he explained, \"several months ago I started a spiritual healing service on Thursday nights.\" I did not know but kept quiet. \"These services ,\" he emphasized, \"must go for­ward.\" Spiritual healing ! We students at the Western had heard about the revival of spiritual healing among Episcopalians and Anglicans, The Emman:ueZ Movement in America and the Gui Zd of HeaZth in England, both created in 1905, but they held no s pecial interest for us . There we re no spiritual healing"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -xxv services in Chicago . Neither seminary I attended ever mentioned the subject. As a matter of fact Episcopalians were a little suspicious of anything like this - so were doctors of medicine , though a few participated in the movement . Dunlop had heard the English spiritual healer, James Moore Hickson , and had been tremendously impressed. Dunlop thought I could do the work, therefore I became the assistant. What was a spiritual healing service ? Unfortunate people, usually accompanied by friends, came from allover Cincinnati and adj acent Kentucky across the Ohio River . Wheel chair cases and those on crutches were ushered up in front of or into the first pews . Very few of our own churchmen attended, except those with some duty to perform. Who wrote the service? Dunlop, I imagine. We sang a hymn, I repeated the prayers and talked. You talk to the well, not the u nwell. , That may sound like Coue , then in the news with the celebrated formula : EVery day in every way I am getting better and better. But actually I learned to treat the s ick as well back in high school days wh en I made hospital and sick calls with the Rev. William Osmond Cone , or occasionally a call upon the lonely with his wife. These were �asual calls , a part of normal life; no falling on knees to ask for guidance, nothing religious about them at all. The Cones, masters of life, I have named in \"Pictures for Alma.\" After the talk, those who desired, came up to the altar rail , where I passed along the kneeling line , placing my hands upon their heads while repeating the authorized words . Then I left the chancel to lay hands on those in wheel chairs or on crutches. Another prayer was said for all and the final hymn sung. Somewhere during the service came the silent pause; just before the laying on of hands , I think. The service lasted ab out an hour . I greeted everyone at the door, talking longer to those who needed a little ex tra attention. There was no follow up, no records were kept. I often thought of those healing services while interviewing healers - even wh ile working on this manuscript. The Chur ch of the Advent today is an integrated par ish and has been for years . But even in my day -neither Dunlop nor I having an automobile and both always pressed for time -we did a token integration outside the parish. Among my many institutional activities I spent two part days each week at the huge Cincinnati General Hospital. Sunday afternoon was the big service, one at which I spoke to a congregation with ages seventy down to small children. In a mixed-age group you address the children. Deaconess Brant worked among the women, especially faLLen women - there always being a group of them present . She knew more about prostitution than anyone in the City . Every prostitute in serious trouble knew she could go to Deaconess Brant for advice and help. Also in the congregation we always had a few blacks. After the service we tried to greet as many of these persons as possible , includi ng the blacks. My other service at the hospital was the weekly bedside luncheon for veterans of World War I, invented and controlled by Miss Eliza Foote, a member of our parish who had been a voluntary hospital worker for years. She not only rounded up the socialite waitresses but also begged money for the food . Who cooked the food and where puzzles me. I well recall slicing one hot ham after another, and that internes and nurses have good appetites. Following the meal we visited with the men, some of wh om off in one corner of the ward were black . Here, in a way, I was returning to my previous Red Cross work. Cincinnati is the place where I met my first well-educated black man, Edmund Harrison Oxley , BA . , BD . (Howard), STD . (Harvard), Rector of St. Andrews, 1912-1957. Forty-five years in the same parishl Here is one of the outstanding black men of his day. Oxley , born in Trinidad, British West Indies, was a special friend of Dunlop 's. Although I knew Oxle'y and had paid a few visits for him·, as"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"XXVI - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -well as for other priests, on my General Hospital days -I had never been in his parish. Dunlop remedied this by suggesting I attend the pre-Christmas party Oxley always gave for the children of his parish . How did it happen that I played Santa Claus for them? Volunteered? Not I, the worst actor in the world. I am guessing that I was the only one present the suit would fit. My Lenten service also drew a few black people, p erhaps Oxley's. The Episcopal Church during Lent held a fifteen minute service daily in a downtown theatre, these each day being in charge of a different Episcopal clergyman who talked five minutes. Whether all these preachers were cartooned or only the odd-looking ones, I found a cartoon of myself in the evening newspaper - still have it. Near the end of my year in Cincinnati, I went to St. James in Columbus , Ohio, a miss ion that had been practically closed ten weeks before my arrival. Later, a friend of mine named Randolph -chaplain for our students at Ohio State Uni­versity - asked me to invite a Hindoo student out to Thanksgiving Day dinner . I telephoned The Deshler , our best hotel , telling the proper official that I was Father Hyatt of St. James Episcopal Church, who wanted to enter tain a Hindoo student from the University. Then I heard , \"Father , we would be delighted to serve you, but you know the situation . How dtzrok is your guest?\" I answered, \"As black as the .ace of spades.\" He was . Neil House, I did not try . On the day itself I explained to my guest that having been unable to obtain reservations, we would take a chance. Opposite the Capitol was a Chinese restaurant on the second floor . Asking my companion to wait on the sidewalk, I cltmbed the stairs. \"Father,\" said the head waiter , \"everything is taken except that secluded booth back there near the kitchen. If you would care to wait a little while •••• \" We were soon in the secluded booth . Did I use my clericals to deceive? A white man deceive a Chinese? We talked Hindooism while eating an excellent meal. After two years at St. James, I sailed for England to live in Oxford . I have now answered the question: \"Had you ever eaten with a black man before [line 27, p.XXII].\" There remain two additions . In 1928 when I gave a scholar­ship to Culver Stockton College, no one was barred from it by reason of national­ity, race , color, creed, belief, etc. Second, I had called upon Negroes for FA CI. At the end of my second day on Deal Island , Jerry came to drive me to Princess Anne; but along the way we decided to continue on to Pocomoke City . Here we ate dinner and afterward made more calls out in the country. Numbers 123-124, in Numbers Bo ok 3, may be two of the homes visited. This I know, it must have been ten o'clock before I registered at Princess Anne's old-fashioned and unmodernized Washington Hotel . Next morning at breakfast I studied the waiter as a possible contact man . He knew my eyes were watching him. His furtive glances showed an interest in me. After the last customer left , I signed the check, giving him an extra good tip -a dollar? Large for that day . \"Do you mind talking with me a few minutes? You have never seen me before,\" I started . He interrupted , \"But I have.\" Having seen me was quite possible. \"Where?\" Then came the surprise. \"During the past week I have seen you three time s in my dreams. You are the man who came in my dreams to show me where there's some buried money. I recognized you while you were entering the dining room this morning and I was just as scared of you as I could be. I'm still scared.\" He was! The name of the man talking was \"Maddox -[No.] 125 - key , treasure, money at Bel[+ 2 or 3 letters] near Princess Anne -skull [Nwnbers Book 3] .\" The treasure and money at BeZ,[?] was the treasure I showed him in his dreams. The key I no longer remember , the skull story he re­peated to the Telediphone later (see 820, p.283). He also told a corpse slobber story (see 821, p.284) . It is always possible Maddox could have heard that a strange man was out at Deal Island. He could not have heard from the night"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -XXVII porter, there was none. I prefer to consider this experience in the same class as interview: SHE FORESAW AUTHOR IN A DREAM, pp. 1085-l097. Maddox brought in several good informants, two of them Joe Dorman (see 822 p.284 & 3103, p.925), and George Tilmar or Tilman (see 3102, p.923) b.1850 in Princess Anne. The white hotel manager , J. Shrieve volunteered a story (see 8, p.5) , and later notified me to drop everything , King Edward VIII was about to speak - the abdication speech , Fr iday, December 11 , 1936. At that moment I was in the dining room where I did my recording. Joshua Wilson (see 3095, p.9l5) who met trains for people seeking George Jackson or Zippy Tull - was a horse and wagon taxi-man. He told me about his experience and I never recorded a word! I was still partly under the influence of the old aatena-of-saying s method of collecting rather than of life situations. Field work can be discouraging , especially your failures and mistakes . Yet, at Princess Anne, I felt for the first time that witchcraft material was actually out there, if I could find it. Jerry Williams having returned home to Baltimore for The Holidays, I went down there after Christmas to interview in the church and home of the Rev. and Mrs . John Burke (Numbers Book, No.4, 136-317). He worked in the BALT IMORE, MD. steel mill and had his private church in a former small store, behind which were two rooms - a combination living-dining room and kitchen. Upstairs were said to be three bedrooms. About 7:15 P.M. the Rev. Mr. Burke began his service, he dressed in a black clerical suit and wearing a large pectoral cross. Some 25 persons sat in the pews. After the congregation left, we - the Burkes, Jerry and I went back into the living-dining room, where I interviewed the clergyman and then his wife. On the morrow and in the same place I would interview members of his church. He approved of me, though he did not know I was a clergyman , and I certainly approved of his religious work. Next morning when Jerry and I arrived we were met by a group of young boys who wanted to pass out my cards and handbills (see p.305 and illustrations) - the first time I had heard of advertisement connected with this type of work. During that day I interviewed Mrs. Williams, Jerry's mother, whose information about Zippy Tull (see 3104, p.926) and George Jackson, her husband's uncle (see 3092, p.9l2; 3093, p.9l3), was alone worth my trip . That night the three of us a ttended a spiritu­alist church , which because of length I reserve for the tape recording . Private churches, temples, tabernacles, altars and religious and spiritual associations are numb ered by the thousands in our large cities . Wilmington followed Baltimore because I could work there in the home of Julia's sister Carrie Gavin (see first few lines of p.l) - her husband's first , name unremembered. He, a retired workman, acted as contact WILMINGTON, N. CAR. man, a good one ; also as receptionist, checking informant's knowledge of what I wanted , and bringing them into and out of the dining room where I interviewed. My luncheon, Carrie served in the same room. In Wilmington I made a great collecting change. Heretofore, I had occa­sionally played back to an informant what he or she had said. After I had lost an exceptionally good story and found several voiceless cylinders, I stopped the practice. The exact opposite followed. I wrapped a piece of thin black cloth, once only, about the sm all microphone and put it into an old black hat face­opened to informant. OLd bZaak hat is mentioned frequently in these volumes. My Cape Fear Hotel room overlooking the river and down into the Sound added much to this experience. Almost always I would work near water. RICHMOND, � About the time I reached Richmond, the Federal Bureau of Investi­gation (FBI) appeared prominently in newspapers - adding more men to the staff or doing something. For the first time, as far as I know, I became the �; and the Zaw I remained to the end for some persons (see lines 3-4 , p.898;"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"XXVIII - Memoirs of Alma Egan H yatt Foundation -44-53, p.1408; etc. ). Here in Richmond - having interviewed 371 persons , only a few of them in Richmond - I met my first professional worker, the kind of doctor I sought: \"No.372 - E.W. Lindsay [see pp.933-948 for his interview] - [born] Greensboro , S.C. - lives 1420 West Catherine St. , going to move [to] West Boyd St. , 1315 - Ex [excellent] -finished talking after 1 A.M. [I am writing this Wednesday morning , April 20 , 1937, after reaching my interview place] -left Carter last night [Tues .] at 2:20 A.M. in lobby [of o ld Jeff­erson Hotel, Richmond, Va.] - after checking records [Telediphone cylinders] got into bed at 3:30 A.M. - 50 records [quite a day -one of the few nights I did not telephone my wifel .\" Numbers Book, No .6, 340-442. [This does not mean 50 cylinders of usable material. Quite a number of them would be left unnumbered , shaved and used again. I had interviewed from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M. , when Lindsay appeared just as I began to pack to leave . For luncheon and dinner, my contact man Carter brought me a sandwich and a glass of milk.] \"[No.1 375 - ng [no good] - came to find out how to protect self , etc.\" Numbers Book 6. [Only several of these persons seeking professional help ever reached me. These few are scattered through the text . The white woman who was not admitted at Wilson, N. Car. , may have been person report­ing me to police -see ILLUSTRATIONS .] Lack of space prevents discussion of many problems and persons : of disappear­ing Doctor King (another doctor in Norfolk did likewise) ; of No .39l, who waited 5 hours, the record, before I could interview him. (I always paid extra for extra long waiting periods -see line 34f., p.102l) ; and Eugene Love, who hearing his number 346 casually spoken to be recorded on the Telediphone, immediately on leaving me bet a penny on it at his gambling place, winning $4. Next day he re­turned to split his winnings , asking for another number! Was I astonished! I explained. This sort of chance use of my words could have caused a rumor that I was giving out lucky numbers (there are in the text examples of persons selling lucky numbers) , therefore I changed to recording informant 's number· after he had left the room. ' Yes , Richmond with doctors Lindsay , Humpadee (a huge woman full of laughter) , King and Johnson (see pp. 1620-l624) proved that these strange professional men and women were out there. Carter and I will now travel (various relatives owned shares DOWN THE ATLANTIC COAST PETERSBURG - NORFOLK down the Atlantic Coast in his familY,car in it) ; first, picking up Peters�urg on the way to Norfolk. Petersburg I had visited once before during my personally historic drive in 1922 from Atlantic City -through Wash­ington , Richmond , Petersburg, Farmville, NEWPORT NEWS - NANSEMOND COUNTY ELIZABETH CITY - CHARLESTON BEAUFORT - SAVANNAH -JACKSONVILLE Lynchburg, Statesville, Hickory, Ashville, Knoxville - to Cincinnati, Ohio. These were the days of bad roads - not much traffic, without trucks, almost sign-less and inadequately mapped , no gasoline stations and few gasoline pumps, these latter always at a garage. My detour round road construction between Richmond and Farmville took me past Petersburg's railroad station. I approached a door marked MEN and I was about to enter wh en I saw the lower word COLORED. To make certain , I walked round the corner to check and to find a similar door labeled MEN and underneath WHITE. For the first time uncon­cealed and total segregation stared me in the face, not by hearsay or something read, but by the stark and brutal truth. We in the North likewise had segrega­tion; but, as I have already written , it was hidden and sugar-coated: \"Father,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo -Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -XXIX we would be delighted to serve you, but you know the situation. How dark is your guest?\" (Line 17, p.XXVI.) Another first-time experience followed the signs a few hours later - chain gangs along a 30 mile stretch of main highway construction west of Farmville. My 3 night letters to my future wife during this journey -found years later among her papers -,give itinerary, mileage, hotels and dates. But back to Petersburg - rainy weather hindering our work there, we continued on to Norfolk where I stayed at the Monticello, the only hotel and old-fashioned even then. As usual I would interview among the black people themselves. Here is a convenient spot to explain this important matter. Never in my life did I interview a black person in a white person's home, except my own (which includes my own hotels) on 5 occasions: (1) in my own New York City apartment study; (2) in our second room at Atlantic Hotel, Ocean City, Md., where I also interviewed one man inside Tyree church; (3) in our living room at Hotel Chamber­lin, Old Point Comfort, Va.; (4) men only, in my room at Hotel Stratford, Fred­ericksburg, Va., though in this city I also went out into the country to inter­view in a few homes of blacks; and (5) in the dining room of Washington Hotel, Princess Anne, Md. Excepting these 5 occasions, all interviewing was done in the homes or hotels of black people. We did well in Norfolk. Then, Doatop Bowles (see 1733-1738) having recom­mended his cousin Bowles as a root doctor in Newport News, we worked that city for a few days while continuing to live in Norfolk. Twice Carter and I visited a shack in a public dump searching for a doatop called Dogfaae or Doghead (Bee lines 30-32, p.175). After resuming work in Norfolk, we on two separate days sought and found Doatop Frank Harris (Bee 1958, p.573) near Suffolk, a remarkable person; and Madam Griffin (see pp.1309-l3l4) out in the country from Berkly. At this point my wife came down from New York City and she and I went to a hotel in Virginia Beach - The Cavalier. Southward down Route 17, Carter and I now traveled to Elizabeth City, N. Car., where we interviewed for several days and then continued to New Bern for the night. Myrtle Beach, S. Car., had nothing but a new, unopened, modernish resort hotel and a deserted beach. The main street of Georgetown along �he water front I liked. Finally came Cooper Bridge, the long main street into Charleston and the Francis Marion Hotel. I would have preferred the Fort Sumter where my wife and I stayed in 1927, but the former was more convenient for my work. I began interviewing Friday, June 25, 1937, at 4 Percy Street, the home of Mrs. Clayborne, No.495, Carter's landlady -Numbep8 Book 7. Many informants here gave me the dialect trouble that had begun in Wilmington. This problem I will discuss on the tape recording. My first and only bemedaZed doatop must not be omitted: \"No.503 - Root Doctor -Tobby Cason [showing he made tobies, see p.655, wore] medals on breast, brought roots in a bag [see introductory comment for Doatop Johnson, p.1620]\" -Numbeps Book 7. Somewhere I mention the fight be-tween two doatops, but not the old man who entered so scared he asked to be excused for a moment. Then I heard screams and a great commotion. Sopn Carter appeared shaking with laughter - the old man seeking the restroom failed to make it. The newspapers of Charleston were filled about someone from Brown University recording the cultured voices of the city. Who selected the VIP'SI (This is Monday morning, June 28, 1937. I'm working in Charleston, testing the machine before beginning the day's work, and it is going to be hot as helllll!) [Because my transcriber used five l's, I must have emphasized the word.] (Yesterday, Sunday afternoon, Carter and I went down south to several of these islands to find poot doatops but there wasn't one there.) [Charles-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"xxx. - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -ton, S. Car., author on 574:2. This was not the special week-day trip Carter and I made to Beaufort, S. Car.] Before I forget, if the reader finds the numbering of any early cylinder confusing, I transcribed the first 85 cylinders (Ediphone) by hand causing the occasional No. + 85. Our wonderful side trip to Beaufort [Bu'fert], S. Car., I mention under Doctor Buzzard. In Savannah I lived at the De Soto Hotel, a nd Carter with Mrs. Lewis at 824 West 39th St., where I interviewed. In Jacksonville, I stayed at the May­flower Hotel and interviewed at the downtown hotel for blacks - Wynn Hotel, Ashley & Jefferson streets (Numbers Book 7 at No.547). Here a woman about to interview me had to be replaced with someone else because, as Carter said, she had to turn a trick with a newly arrived customerl She came in later. Route No.1 led us back to Fredericksburg and on to Washington WASHINGTON, D.C. for the final interviewing of the long trip. At last I felt experienced enough to attempt New Orleans. MOBILE, ALA. Instead of waiting until after Mardi gras, I decided on a pre-Mardi-gras practice session, first in Mobile and then in Vicksburg - a wise decision because both places were strongly influenced by New Orleans. My wife and I taking the train to Mobile stopped at the Battle House. The first two days we hired an automobile to tour Mobile and the nearby coast. Our driver was Edward Bufford, Jr., born near or at East St. Louis, Ill. Liked by both my wife and me, he became my contact man and after training an excellent one (see ILLUSTRATIONS). I worked in the home of Daisy Edwards, who signs receipts daily for $2 - rent, electricity and receptionist - but on Feb. 26, 1938 an additional 50¢ for coal reminded me of England in 1923. The same receipt gave her a $5 bonus (Numbers Book 8, 647-694, used as temporary account book). If $17 for a 6 1/2 day week (probably 30 hours) sounds like small rent and wages, these were years of the Great Depression when people were lucky to obtain $7 weekly on public relief. I must have been fair, for on my second trip to New Orleans and Memphis my contact men and women came back to work. Let me add, not once did I have any trouble with anyone interviewed by or working for me. Not one of them ever uttered an improper word or made an inappropriate suggestion. Mardi gras we observed in Mobile. My wife, not feeling too well, telephoned an old friend of ours in New York City, Clarence Garfield Bandler, M.D., for the name of a Mobile doctor. The latter, hearing that I was working in the Negro district, asked her the date of my last smallpox vaccination. She answered I had never been vaccinated. \"Get him out at once, we are having a smallpox epidemic in there!\" With smallpox, just a handful of cases is an epidemic. Not a word about this had been in the newspaper or on radio. VICKSBURG, MISS. And so we moved to Vicksburg, staying at Hotel Vicksburg. From here to the end of this INTRODUCTION, most of the ma­terial will be my lone comments to the Te1ediphone, always in parentheses, or my conversation with contact man Edward, his words in double quotation marks as follows: (Testing the stylus, Vicksburg, Miss. Wednesday, March 2, 1938. The first day's work. We are beginning with No.7l4.) \"[They will be] round heah about 9:15 or 9:30.\" [Edward talking.] (Who were they?) \"Ah got the name in the book. Miss C[something] - got the name listed and everything.\" (Well, why are they going to call me up?)"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -XXXI \" IIThey wants to call you up on account, they say, they ain't taking any chances of coming and telling dere story that they wants to tell.1I (Well what did they say about North and South? What did they say about that?) [Edward is repeating something previously told to me.] IIWell, they say, if you was a Soutbern man, they reckon they wouldn't come and tell you no story of no kind.\" (I see.) II And if you was a Northern man, they know you wasn't out to put 'em in j ail or nuthin and they'd come round and tell you their story.\" (I see. Well, let's get on with our work. Have you been able to get in touch with that root doctor here?) \"Yes, sir, at half past one.\" (Think he'll come?) IIMight be here the middle of this week. He got a office and everything - use a license for that kind of stuff.\" (Oh, they use a license.) \"Have a license for that kind of stuff.\" (I see. Well, that should be very interesting.) \"He have an office right down in back of [something].\" [He came later but was \"no good.\"] [Vicksburg, Miss., 981:1.] We reached New Orleans at night and took two taxis to The Roosevelt; my wife riding alone with her and my luggage, Edward and I with my equipment and his bag - it being against the law for a white taximan to drive NEW ORLEANS, LA. a lone Nigger passenger. He used the word Nigger in Edward's MY FIRST VISIT presence. I told Edward I would not work for several days (I wanting to be with my wife), but he was to meet me for in­structions next morning. I wanted him to find an old-time taximan, thoroughly reliable, who knew the underworld of fortunetellers, doators, healers and the like. He came up with Mack Berryhill (see ILLUSTRATIONS). No other person could have been better and without him we could have failed. (Testing the stylus for the 3rd time.) (New Orleans, La. Friday, March 11th, 1938.) (In the two previous times of testing the stylus there seems to. be a skip -it must be the stylus, it couldn't be the amplification. Edward s'aid that there were probably 60 people downstairs waiting for me. Yesterday when I came there were 30 people and about noon there were over 100. This morning when I came, Edward said that a policeman had come up asking why all the people were standing out on the sidewalk, and he explained that they came around to talk to me -everything was quite all right. I do hope this thing will get straightened out in a few minutes, because I h ad trouble with amplification this morning but I didn't have any trouble with the stylus. Now, let's see how that works. Now.) [At this moment a policeman walked in!] (An officer just came in to see what was going on here and we had a little talk for about fifteen or twenty minutes, talking about hoodoo, and he said he would go down and clean out that crowd for me downstairs. I missed a great opportunity. I should have had my machine on while the officer was talking. It was very interesting.) (An officer just left. The report is around that I was working for the govern­ment - giving away money for hoodoo business. So we had a talk for fifteen or twenty minutes and he just said he would go down and clean out the crowd for me. There are about 50 people downstairs.) [After the policeman left the room, Edward Bufford my contact man walks in to warn me I h ad to be careful. Though Edward had worked for me in Mobile, where I"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"XXXII - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -had found him, and had continued with me and my wife to Vicksburg and now to New Orleans, he was doubtful about success here, also a little frightened. I was neither too confident nor brave - the latter especially, after the policeman's visit. Had my wife not been with me, I might have abandoned the Great Quest. Everything would depend upon the experience of this day.] [Many brackets in these volumes were made years ago, while checking tran-scription against cylinders.] (Careful?) \"Yes, sir, you gotta be careful.\" [Edward speaking.] (You think we are throwing away money, huh?) \"Yes, sir.\" (Well, now if you'll get your chair and sit around here beside me, they won't do anything in the daytime.) \"No, sir, but we gotta keep our eye on them. You can't never tell what a man has under his shirt. Some of them. are half crazy, too.\" (Well, now, you put your chair right in front of the door [outside my door] where you can hear what is going on.) \"I sure will.\" (Now, you keep right here.) [New Orleans, La., 1144:8.] (Testing the stylus, New Orleans, La., Wednesday, March 16, 1938. The last person yesterday with whom I talked, Edward said he had talked with me for two hours and forty-five minutes - in fact Edward came into the room to see if any­thing had happened to me.) (This man is a hoodoo doctor. He calls himself Charlie Wilson - probably is an assumed name because Mack knew him as Alfred.) (I am having some trouble with the stylus on my transcriber ••• the crystal stylus, so I called up the [manager?] at the [Thomas E. Edison] Company this morning and he is sending a man around tonight after I get back to the hotel to check up, to see whether the stylus is tipped or whether there is a catch in the mechanism somewhere. When I take a record, it digs into the cylinder for about one revolution and spoils whatever is to go on that revolution. It has not be­come too bad yet, but I thought I might as well check up on it at once.) [I have a note made later, \"rubber was worn out.\"] (The next number will be 853.) [New Orleans, author on 1343:2.] As soon as my wife left for New York City, I moved over to the St. Charles, an older hotel but more convenient for me because it had a side entrance, was a less showy place, and near Kolb's (German) Restaurant. One morning Mack, while driving me to the Patterson Hotel, said Edward had hurt himself badly by running against a projecting piece of waterpipe. True, I saw that Edward could scarcely walk, and then only by holding his hip. Caffrey, evidently let in by Mack who was helping Edward, told me he had healed him (lines 5-16, p.1469). That I doubted. To have a confrontation, I called for Edward to show Caffrey out. Believe it or not, Edward was walking! Not holding his hipl Collusion? Not a chance. I could see that that bruise and pain were still there. That night, having worked from 9 A.M. to 8 P.M., not getting out of my chair more than twice for a minute or two - that night I could not lift myself out of that chair. Edward helped me up. And when I started to walk, I limped and held on to my hip the same way Edward had done that morning! I began to laugh but could not possibly explain to Edward. As I entered the St. Charles dining room, the head waiter conuniserated, \"Captain, how did you hurt yourself?\" I should explain here for the general reader that in hoodoo and similar healing,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo -Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -XXXIII a disease or pain is cured by transferring it to someone or something else (see p.383). My pain was a long-standing calcium deposit or whatever it is called. I had limped and held on to my thigh before. But my coincidental experience could have been psychologically dangerous for an unprepared field worker or believer. Another danger came at the end of one long day's work. My last informant, a woman, was talking - every word, her voice evil. For the first and only time in my life I felt the physical presence of evil. The woman's departure came as a relief. I just made the dining room before it closed. A shower followed. I now understood what total-submersion baptism meant to the early Christian - a washing away of evil. Completely refreshed and ready for bed, I delayed to take the final therapeutic action. Tired as I was, I sat down to replay those evil cylinders. The evil had disappeared! Fatigue and exhaustion are also a danger in field work. The woman's monotonous voice had half hypnotized me! A third danger for the field worker is a newspaper reporter! Neither in Adams County, Illinois, nor in the South did I want prospective informants making up sayings or stories, or visiting public libraries, as a preparation for my visit to them or their visits to me. One morning Edward entered to say, \"There's a young colored man out here, been setting over a hour waiting to see you, but I won't let him in - says he's a newspaper reporter.\" I let him in, a pleasant and intelligent person. Neither of us asked for credentials. My work I explained briefly. \"Have you ever found much use of drugs among these people, he inquired?\" \"That,\" I replied, \"I wouldn't know, not being able to identify an addict; but plenty of alcohol is evident.\" Was he a stool pigeon? I doubt it. Fortunately he had no real interest in my work. LITTLE ROCK, ARK. The train from New· York City through St. Louis brought me to Little Rock. Memorable were the 4 tallest osage orange trees I had ever seen, these in front of my hotel, the Pike - whether Albert or Zebulon, I am uncertain. (Testing the stylus, Memphis, Tenn., Tuesday, May 24 or 25 - I don't know which - 1938. The next number will be 915. We have been having considerable trouble getting started here in Memphis. We arrived from Little Rock, Ark., Thursday night. So we have been here Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and this is Tuesday. In my recordings at Little Rock, Ark., I did not test the stylus on the ordinary cylinder, therefore I must be careful and see that I have those cyl­inders marked properly when I get home. Edward has just gone out to bring in the people.) (I think we began a little bit the wrong way here, or at least Edward did. He began by rounding up all the professionals, which frightened them, so today we are beginning by rounding up the ordinary people, and if the professionals want to come around later, why all well and good. But we figure with the ordinary people we will probably do our usual work here.)

Last night I thought I might try to see if there was an Italian or a Chinese Restaurant in Memphis because I have become thoroughly tired of hotel food, so I asked the porter and he told me to go to Pete and Joe's, just opposite the Court House -the County Court House and City Jail. Surprisingly to relate, the food was very good. I had ravioli and it really was excellent. I shall go there tonight and try to have spaghetti or something of that sort.)

[This entry was made as soon as I returned to The Peabody - that was as fast as I could pack and leave the Eureka.] Up to this point I had had no trouble with the police, seeing no reason why I should have had. In fact, the policeman in New Orleans (see p.XXXI) had been courteous, and from Memphis on, I found the chiefs-of-police cooperative when I called upon them for permission to work in the Negro district (see what I say about police in my letter to Edward Bufford in ILLUSTRATIONS). Permission of course was never given in writing. As soon as the police rushed into the room, one said to the other, \"Call the wagon and throw this goddam son-of-a-bitch and his crap into it.\" And worse! I was too stunned to be frightened or to say any­thing foolish. Experience in the Chicago slums came to my aid (see p.XVI). Had I said, \"This is a free country,\" I would have had hell beaten out of me for resisting arrest! Fortunately they mistook my comatose condition for composure, poise or whatever term lawmen use for this situation -cool was then unknown. I explained my work, a scientific investigation of beliefs, and if they would ac­company me to The Peabody, I would in the presence of the manager open my safety deposit box and show many credentials. Who reported me to the police? Probably a stool pigeon. All this happened on a Saturday! Back at the hotel I sat down to write the note (see ILLUSTRATIONS). It was only then I realized I had taken one hellofa beating. Further work in Memphis was impossible. I telephoned my wife to explain everything and to tell her I was boarding the next train home. First, I drove Edward down to the railroad station to watch his train pullout for Mobile. This experience in Memphis almost killed Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork. My wife and I, while in Toronto on business, suddenly decided to crpss Canada by train, drive down the Pacific coast to and a little way into Mexico, and return to New York City, stopping at Grand Canyon and elsewhere. Finally, I decided not to chicken out -I had to resume work, I had to return to Memphis. But, before I did, I interviewed 539 informants elsewhere (see MADAM WILEY, pp.1556-l567). ST.

This is a trip Edward and Marshall made to Algiers on our first visit to New Orleans.] FINAL COMMENTS As soon as I have had a rest of several months by going away somewhere, I will start to produce the tape recording account of many things omitted - these from notes made through the years. A few final comments follow . After four consecutive years of concentrated work on this manuscript - these not including former years of sorting, eliminating and trying to reduce a mass of material to workable dimensions - I was too tired at my age to write an adequate or ordered INTRODUCTION. At least the disorder of the preceding attempt is quite in keeping with the subject matter. Subj ect matter! Fortunately a master of it reached me just before these final few pages were handed to the printer. He raises a question about FA CI I had for­gotten: \"University of California Los Angeles, Center for the Study of Compar­ative Folklore and Mythology, December 18, 1969. Rev. Harry Middleton Hyatt •••• Dear Rev. Hyatt: At last I have an effective address for you, supplied by my friend of many years, Dr. Duncan Emrich of Washington ..•• I am so pl eased to learn that you are still active, and that you have now just completed a definitive work on witchcraft and conjury. I am certainly eager to receive a c opy of this new work, and to make sure that copies will also be in our main University Research Library and in the Staff Library of the Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology . Duncan tells me that the supply of the second edition of the Adams County book is about out of print. We have a copy in the University Research Library, but I should like to possess it personally; so please dispatch me a copy at once, together with the invoice •••• You would be able to feast y our eyes on my wonderful sections on witchcraft, conjury, the devil, the evil eye , hoodoo, voodoo, etc. - all of which is from published sources - if you could find a way to visit our Center. Yours sincerely [signed] Wayland D. Hand - Director.\" I was delighted to hear from Dr. Hand because a considerable amount of unused hoodoo material - perhaps enough for a third volume - must be preserved and may need a future home. But his request for an invoice could not be honored, the few remaining copies of FA CI being reserved for the new universities springing up everywhere round the world. Instead, I presented FACI to him as a token of respect for his great contribution to the folklore field. Few p ersons are aware that more than 100 folklore classes are now offered in our universities; that in several universities a doctor's degree is given in the subject. Of the 1000 copies of FACI printed (2nd ed.), 750 were mailed in ope�tion Odyssey of a Book to libraries in every p art of the world as a memorial to my"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"XLII - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -wife. I have an astonishing collection of acknowledgments, some of them includ­ing friendly letters or notes, or brief notations on formal acceptance card. [See LI BRARIAN LETTERS AND NOTES section at end of Volume Two.] Every great university and national library accepted - even a few libraries behind the Iron Curtain and Peking (so spelled on letterhead). Only eight copies were re jected -a non-university town in Germany, Palma in Majorca (sent as a tribute to what used to be called The 12th Noctu�e, the .first Chopin I ever heard), and Morocco. The five returns in the U.S.A., included four public libraries in cities of mod­erate size, and one university I had never heard of until I picked it out of The Wo�Zd A Zmanac. FACI - a special memorial - was not offered to reviewers. For this reason I treasured librarian acceptances that began to arrive. They came at an opportune time, another personal misfortune being seemingly imminent. These formally printed cards and sheets, as well as typewritten letters and notes, inspired and encouraged me to resume work on HOODOO. Some of them I have quoted in part at the end of volume two - the most important position, liturgically. The first paragraph of the PREFACE refers to several copies Xeroxed for copy­right purpose and for distribution should anything have happened to me. The in the memory of is for a man I never knew, he dying of cancer in a hospital when I first met my future wife. I am merely keeping a promise made to her years ago and in a manner she would have approved. That name Henry before Hyatt in illustration two at the end of volume two puzzles my memory. True, more people knew me as Henry than Harry because my future wife had renamed me; but where could the detective agency have found it? And how did they learn about the honorary doctor's degree I have not used in years? Evidently among identification papers submitted to them, they saw one referring to me as Dr. Henry Hyatt. I employed the agency because we were work­ing in a TOUGH district. Not the blacks did I question, but the white underworld bosses. An unknown white man working in black neighborhood was always suspected. Only once before had I felt doubtful - that was on my �eturn to Memphis. The second edition of FACI was delayed because I attempted an elaborate index. For example take the word red -Red: clothes (all item numbers listed after each entry), cow, flower, food, medicine, paper, sky, etc. Cf. blood. I also used an exhaustive system for magic rites, classifying every possible type - Magic: articles, colors, deception (1179), difference (1257), direction, hand, location (corner, center of room, attic, etc.), etc. I have over 6000 cards with thou­sands of entries, and not halfway through the manuscript! HOODOO was delayed because I felt it a little advanced for the public. These last ten years it is I who have been unadvanced! If I have spoken much about myself in this INTRODUCTION, it is because - had someone else written these volumes, I would like to know something about the man who made the attempt. If the reader agrees, he will learn more about me in \"Pictures for Alma,\" at the end of the second edition of FACI. Perhaps this is also a protest against today's impersonality. These two volumes are also a protest showing how society failed to educate underprivileged people, black and white. Among special acknowledgments are: R.H.

All this is a long way from that September morning in 1964 when I drove out of Cincinnati for ho me in Gladstone, New Jersey. Never did I drive more carefully. A few days before I had been shocked in Quincy , Illinois , on learning I had cata­racts; so muCh so, I made a serious mistake . I should have been fitted for tem­porary glasses before leaving Quincy. As I went along towards the Turnpike my problems were two , one immediate and the other later. How was I going to drive through the tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike? I could have used tunnel-less Route 40 to the south , but driving hazards would have been greater. Besides, I knew the Turnpike. And that second but later problem. What was I going to do with myself? I could not live alone another winter in the old home. One answer came before I reached the Turnpike. I would complete the second edition of PACI! Where could there have been a better place to work than in our very new dinekit -as I called it - on our dining table in front of the wide picture window, looking out over our feeding station . The first night I made the first motel on the Turnpike. Next morning on reaching the first tunnel I pulled off to the right , to stop to think. I saw a large truck just entering the tunnel. I looked behi nd me. Here came another large truck. As he passed I jumped in behind him, letting him run interference for me . Similarly I cleared all tunnels!

My mother and fath er and grandmother and lots of other people were there. And she started to climb up the wall. Of course they had to tie her in bed. And then they all got frightened. My mother got under the bed. And she died that night. And when the time for the funeral came, which I guess was about two or three days after , they put her in the hearse. And she bled from the house to the cemetery. It came through the casket [coffin] and hearse. They say there was a stream of blood from the house to the cemetery. [New York City, (1), by hand. These three faats - where aolleated, from whom and how, are given for aU material; so metimes ''when'' is added, this in Gaston Co •• N. Car., 1892 .] 2. [I now quote for comparison of beliefs my accounts of the preceding white witch\"' s death and burial:] Miss Healer [a professional healer] called me [the Informant] up [1932] and said Witch was sick and she wanted to see me. So that Sunday afternoon [my] Daughter took me over to Witch's, and Witch told me she was sick. And then she said , \"Informant, do you know that Christ came to me this morning and had His thorns on His head like when He was crucified.\" And then she said He had His arms stretched out like this [here Informant stretched out her arms imitating Witch's action] and called her. He wanted her to come. Then we j ust talked from then on. Well, then I don' t know what happened. See. But every day it just seemed like I would have to go to her house. And we generally just set and talked. That was about six weeks all told. And then one Saturday morning I went real early , about eight o'clock , and when I went in, this Miss Healer was there. And then she left. Then Witch's Husband, he wanted to go to the barber shop to get shaved, and he said, \"Well, I'll go because Informant is here.\" After he left, Witch got those hysterical spells. She would scream and pull her hair and kind of go wild. I couldn't do anything with her. Then, every time I would leave her house, she would pray on me and made a cross about here [Informant crossed her heart]. Every time she"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"2 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -made a prayer, she was praying over these medals. [Informant, though a Prot­estant, was wearing several blessed Roman Catholic medals over her heart.] She didn't know I had them on, of course . Well, that was the last Saturday I was there. See. So when I got home I called Miss Healer and I said, \"Do you think Witch is worse?\" And she said, \"No.\" She said, \"Mrs . I nformant , I think she's just working on your nerves\" - cause s he said, whenever she's there, Witch's all right; but whenever Witch seen me coming, she would throw herself into those spells. So I told Miss Healer about Witch praying on me, and she said, \"I be­lieve she's putting you in a spell.\" And she said, \"Why can' t you go out to Father Z?\" And, let's see , we waited u ntil next week . Miss Friend [Roman Catholic] took us [Informant , Daughter and small Grandson] out. We pressed the bell and went into the hallway and some young priest came. We told him we wanted to speak to Father Z. Then Miss Friend introduced me to him. And he told her to go into the parlor on the other side. And I guess I went into his study. Well, then we talked and he said, \"What made you come to me?\" He said, \"Don't you go to any church?\" I told him I belonged to B. Church [which Informant had not attended for years] and he said, why didn' t I go to him [the clergyman there]. I told him that I heard out to Y. Church the priests could help you if you thought you were hoodooed. He didn't say much of anything. He was a very firm old man. Let' s see, so then I told him about Witch and told him that it seemed like I had to go every day . So then he said , \"Who is this old hex?\" I said , \"Her name is Witch\" - I didn't even say her last name - \"she lives in the south part of town.\" And he said to me , \"Oh my !\" He said, \"You are about the fiftieth person from the South End of town that's been to me because they thought this woman had hoodooed them.\" And then he said some thing about the South End of town . I don't remember what he said . I told him, too, about her saying that we had it too good here [in Informant's home] , th at she was going to get even with us and make me suffer , having this swell home and getting all of [Husband's] salary, and this and that. And then I told him about [Husban d]. At that time Husband hadn't left home y et. [Informant and Husband separated perman­ently two years later.] And he said to me, \"Don't you divorce him\" - that's been three years ago [1932] - \"he'll give this girl up .\" Everybody thought so. He said, \"A wife has the best chance of holding a husband.\" So then he prayed on me . He stood up with his cross and prayed over me - whatever you call it. And he said , \"I am going to give you this medal. I think it is the best one in my whole collection.\" Then after I thought a minute, I said to Father Z., \"Do you think it would hurt me to put this medal in Husband's clothes?\" And he said, \"No, it might help.\" He wanted Husband to come out to see him, and I told him he would never come. See, he kinda thought we were both put in a spell. B ut see, Husband would never go . So he said to me, \"Don't you ever go in Witch's house a gain.\" I told him I wo uldn't. And he said he would· offer special prayers for me in church next day . I said, \"What do l owe you?\" He said, \"Nothing .\" I said , \"I want to g ive you something for your trouble and time.\" So I gave him a dollar. And he told me to drop it in a little slit in the desk. I don't know what he said, whether they use it for the poor or for the church. I think he said that . Miss Friend said if I had given him a quarter he would have been satisfied. And then we [Informant and Miss Friend] went out to the car . And then Miss Friend took Grandson and Daughter in. Daughter thought Witch had Grandson hoo­dooed too. It seemed that every time she [Witch] would come here [to Informant' s home], Grandson would get one of those spells. He would be playing, and if Witch would be here, s ee, why it just seemed like he would fall any place he would be at. One d ay he was at the top of the steps and fell clean down. Another day he"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -3 stood in the cellar way here [just off the kitchen where I sat while recording this story]. And several times he was sitting in the high-chair and would just get like a dish rag, limber, and fall right out of the chair and turn blue. And sometimes it would take us a half hour to get him to come out of it. And Witch [who was frequently hired for housework] would always run and pick him up and rub him. Daughter and I wo uld cry, thought he was going to die. And she said, \"0h, he will be all right.\" So one day Daughter found one of his stockings on a bush around the house, and so she got it and took it to the cellar and burned it up. After we burned that up Witch never came back. Then Witch took sick. That 's where my story started, s ee. Well, then, all the doctors thought Grandson had heart trouble and they couldn' t do anything for him. And they said they didn't understand why the medicine didn't work on him to get him out of these spells.� Dr. Q. said, whenever he got another spell, to call him up that minute. He never got any more after we burned the stocking . But in the meantime we took him to Father Z. I didn't go in, but Daughter to ld him that she thought he had heart trouble. And he said he never heard a child so small [two years old] having heart trouble. He prayed on Grandson and he never had another spell. Daughter wasn't so generous . She didn't give him a nickel. It was worth a dollar, if you thought y ou were in a spell, to get rid of it. From that time on he began to gain and gain, and Dr. Q. couldn't understand it. When I came back from Father Z., I called up Miss Healer and told her I went to Father Z. and he told me not to go to Witch's house any more. So I didn't. But the end of the week, Witch kept calling for me , said she must see me . And Miss Healer knew that I would not go there any more because Father Z. told me not to, so she told Witch my phone was out of order . And Witch told her, \"You try again every day un til you get her.\" That was like Friday. Saturday after­noon Miss Healer went to Witch ' s to give her a treatment . Miss Healer is sup­posed to be a healer. She don't tell you what she does. People say she is good. She don't take no pay. What you give her she takes. Then, while she was there, Witch grabbed her by the wrist, like this [Informant demonstrated the hold] , and Miss Healer said to me, \"You don't know what a feeling it was .\" I said to Miss Healer, \"Maybe she is putting a spell on you.\" And Miss Healer said, \"I am not afraid of her because I can take spells off. II She says she can't, but the South End says she can . So Monday morning Miss Healer called me up and told me she went to St. Mary's Hospital Sunday afternoon to give one of her patient's treat­ment. She walked up the steps and as she got in the big hall she fell flat, full length of her face. She said the sister run to see if she was hurt. She said, \"No.\" But she said, \"I felt like a fooL\" She said it hurt her so bad she could hardly get home. So she didn't go to WitCh's, Sunday night. So Monday morning Witch 's Husband went after her. She told Witch 's Husband she couldn't come, she fell and hurt herself. So she didn ' t go Monday to Witch's. Then he said, \"Call Informant on the phone.\" And she told him our phone was still out of order . Then Tuesday morning early, Witch 's Husband went about six o'clock and begged her to come again. She said� \"I can't come, I can't walk on my foot .\" She told me she wouldn 't go back . So he went back home and told Witch . And she made him go to the grocery store on the corner, F's Grocery, and call her up again, or me. She said, \"I told you I couldn't come at six o'clock and I can't come now.\" I don't know what I will do,\" he says , \"no neighbor will come in [they were afraid of Witch].\" Then Witch 's Died all alone. then.

[My accou nt of the funeral of the preceding white witch follows :] Some South End (of Quincy) women were out to the cemetery after J's (Mary's) funeral, and they said they tried several times to lower her casket and they couldn't do it. They had to dig the hole larger than usual. [I now comment on this informant's statement. ] This refers to the burial of a reputed witch who died in 1932 and is a good example of the unreliability of eye witnesses , espe­cially when these witnesses were expecting something unusual. It should be remembered that by this time a coffin was not lowered into an empty grave , but into a wooden container; hence the width and length of a grave were much larger than the coffin. Another witness, however , said it was only the lowering appa­ratus which refused to work. (Even that would be awesome l) This was probably the case. A third witness said the reason the coffin could not be lowered was that J \"didn't want to go .\" [FACI, 2ed., 1965, p.7ll, No. 15374.] 4. There was an old woman who went for a cunjure. She lived in King George and she must have been a good cunjure because she made her living in that way, putting on spells and taking them off. A neighbor lived not far from her house was hunting squirrels in the squirrel season and he passed near her home in the woods, and he saw she had a snake tied by the tail hanging up the tree, and she had cut its throat and catching the biood in a small bucket. She wasn't there. And he said to himself, \"Damn you! I always heard you was a cunjure and now I know it.\" That was about forty years ago . She was a real cunjure. Everybody was afraid of that woman, both white and colored. If she came to your house and asked you for anything , it paid you to give it to her. She said, \"You're going to lose ten times more than that .\" [This is called \"putting a bad mouth on you.\"] She went to a neighbor one day and asked for a watermelon and he did not believe in aunjuring. So he didn't give her the watermelon and lost his horse that night. And then on he took off his hat to this woman. I knew both of them.

The following story, all the material he gave ;.--me , came from my hotel manager at Princess Anne, the only white informant in this book.

See Zippy Tull in the Index·.] This was I would imagine about sixty-five or seventy years ago [before 1936]. This lady [a white woman] was a relative [great-aunt] of mine, [the informant is a wh ite man], she was living in Wicomico County at a little country place by the name of Siloam, Maryland - Wicomico County. She was going with a young man living in that same neighborhood and they were engaged to be married. There was another girl that this same gentleman was [had been ] going with, which of course I can't [do not care to] call his name , but he was [had been] going with these two girls and they were very much in love with this one particular man . And in order to get the advantage of the [engaged] girl - her name was a Miss B., she [the other girl] tried to find some way to get rid of Miss B., and in doing so, the only way she knew how would be to fix some way to put a spell on her . She had lady friends of course was stopping with Miss B., and also with her, so she got one of these ladies to secure a lock of her hair . And in doing that , Miss B., of course, didn ' t know that she was securing this lock of hair. It run on for a little while and she was taken sick. In other words , it was more like her mind - her mind got to be very, very bad , very bad . She consulted doctors frequently but nobody could seem to do her any good. She gradually grow worser in her condition . Of course, the gentleman friend that she had , wasn't paying so much attention to her while her being sick. He figured that wouldn 't be the woman for him. He was paying more attention to this other young lady, number two I would call her . But in doing that, t his lady tried round different physicians. Finally she couldn 't get any relief, she went to see an old [colored] lady by the name of Zippy Tu11. She was known for several counties as being a great fortune teller. She could remove spells, as we now call them, from different people; she could put 'em on someone else, if necessary. She co nsulted Zippy Tu11 and , in doing that, she [Zippy Tu11] told her her troubles , told her what was causing these troubles . She said, \"Well, can I get cured?\" She said, \"Yes , I can cure you.

If I can get well, I feel that that would be the biggest thing in life. \" \"But,\" she said, \"I can tell you how to get well .

And him and her sat there and drink. But while she was in the kitchen she took some sweet spirits of nitre and put it in papa 's drink. Well, he didn't know no diff'rent, 'cause it was strong, and he jist drank it right on down . And while he was asleep she took some of his hair and -she cut it out -and if you take a person's hair and put it in runnin' water it'll r un 'em crazy. And so she cut some of papa's hair. So when he woke up he says , \"Well,\" he says , \"Lida , I didn' t know I was goin ' to sleep ,\" he says, \"please excuse me.\" She says, \" Well, that's all right Sam,\" she says, \"you used to come to see me and go to sleep.\" And he didn' t think anything of it and went home. And about three days after, he begin to feelin ' funny for some cause or another. And every time he'd take a drink he would - seemed like he wouldn't have any se nse at all. When he'd come home, s eemed like if anybody would say anything to him - at least you wouldn' t have to say anything to him - the least little fault he'd find, he'd wan'a start fightin'. And Miss Ella couldn't under­stand it. She says, \"Sam, what's ailin ' you?\" And he'd cuss and rip and rare, and the same way he'd beat us. He 'd make us all pull off our clothes and he 'd take his belt - he'd always wear a heavy belt - and take it off and double it and beat us with it. And so one day a m an came to the house and Miss Ella, he was a white man, he claimed to be a fortune-teller , and Miss Ella was telling him how papa would act. And he said he would come back when papa was home. And so when he came back he looked at papa and he told Miss Ella, he says , \"Ella ,\" he said, \" there's s ome­thing awful wrong with Sam,\" he says , \"but I'll tell you wha t choo kin do ,\" he says, \"zhoo can go to Conway , South Carolina, to a certain man , and he'll tell you exactly what to do to cure him.\" And so Miss Ella did.

And the man told Miss Ella that the woman [Miss Lida] that he used to go with, he says, that she still wanted him but she was mad because she [Miss Ella] was going with him.

And she left home and just as soon as she did , James , Miss Ella's little boy, got her track, her right track, and put it in a box. And Miss Lida came back.

And she sent papa there [to Miss Lida] with it. And while she was back in the kitchen papa took and put it - jis' like that [pointing to the door] , you see , put it over the door. And , the man [in Conway] told him if he would do that and leave it there, in nine days time he would be cured , you know, of the worst part of it, then to come back to him . And sure enough, in nine days time papa went back to him. And he said, \"Now Sam,\" he says , \"take some of your urine,\" he says , \"in a little bottle and put it under her doorstep,\" and he say s, \"she 'll come to you and confess.\" And papa did that. But she came while papa was at work. And she sit down and told Miss Ella just how she had done. And she said, \"If you will jist please,\" she says, \"take whatever you got on me away,\" she says , \"I'll n ever do it agin.\" And Miss Ella had a chance to take the bottle up from under her doorstep and we didn 't have any more trouble with her.

Well, they claim the reason why is it 's circled - well, that bloodstain , it came from when Christ was killed , when He was hung on de Cross. A man was driving nails in His feet, he got his hands bloody and when he finished he just bent down and wiped them right there at the foot of the Cross, and by Him hanging there bleeding , that from then on that grass sprung and after that it always showed a bloody stain.

It's used purposely for that and nothing else that I know of, but a lot of these hoodoo fe ZZows use it for other purposes - but it is , that's the legend of it.

[The informant , a grown girl in Georgia when Sherman marched to the sea, here acknowledges two spirits within -one urging evil thoughts and actions, the other prompting their opposites.

A good spirit, it leaves the body\" that is why the body becomes helpless. It cannot exist any longer. It goes to de�omposition because the spirit is gone . The life is gone out of it . But still the spirit never dies. It goes to its immediate loved ones on earth , it overlooks them, it hovers around them. In my belief, what I have really had experience of, we are continually being enveloped and surrounded by the spirits of our loved ones who have gone before ; especially until their spirits have been reincarnated and born in some child and come back to the world in the flesh again . The reincarnation comes earlier in some and late in others. Sometimes they are reincarnated in babies who a re cut off. That spirit comes right back and goes again to be on earth until it is reincarnated. That is the good spirit. The evil spirit, it is ab road in the world. That is the spirit of those who haven't lived their lives consistent with r ight living . Their spirits are abroad and still doing work they were engaged in , either frightening or bringing about disorder, just like they was when in the body , until they are reincarnated . They are reincarnated . Usually it comes out in the child. The child is very fretful. Usually , if it goes to any age, it goes into crime. That is the people that chose the evil way in life. When man was created he was created in the image of God . When he fell, that is in the Garden of Eden. Then wh en he was redeemed, he has since that time been left as a free agent to chose which he will do, right or wrong. That is the choice given us by the Son of God who died for us that we might be redeemed under the curse of the broken Law. Since then, we have this privilege of chosing for ourselves and being left as a free agent. Then this is the pOint wh ere the evil and the good spirit exist. This is the origination of the good spirit and the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -21 evil . The good is permanent and the evil spirit is a choice of man. You know how long Christ stayed on the Cross, three days. It is supposed that everybody when they die their spirit still lingers in their body and about their personalities for three days until they are planted in the ground. Then it is around and about until the changes c�e. When the spirit comes out of your body your body really becomes like neutral, you can't move or do anything; you never will again. The mind o f the person does not die. That is the spirit after all. That is the soul so to speak. It lingers around and it really sees what's being done until its visit is complete. The person who is responsible for the arrange­ment of the final affairs will dream about them. Often you will be half asleep and that person will appear to you and give you some gestures, satisfactory or dissatis facto ry. I know that by experience.

[Despite the preceding title Two spirits, they are two in character but one in s ubs tance.] I have hear' n people say that your spirit travels -it is out walking around at places where you have worked. You're sleeping and maybe you're trying to wake up -you're having a hard time waking. If you die, your spirit ONE SPIRIT is gone from you, they say . I t takes a long time to get it back.

She [the other girl' s m other] was in the kitchen making light bread. ,And all at once I look towards the barn and I said, \"Oh , look Maryl What 's coming?\" And she turned around and looked and she said to me , \"Oh , Lucy ! What is that?\" I said, \"I don't know.\" And at that time it was something looked like Jesus. He had a white robe throwed around Him and He wasn't touching the earth . He came from the sunrise and kept rising higher and higher and went to the sunset. Then we got frighten and run in the house and hollered. So the madam says, \"What is the matter with you?\" And we told her what we seen . And she said, \"It is a story. You didn't see anything . It's just a lamp setting in the window.\" So next night we tried it again , and the next night we tried it again. And I have never seen it since. [New York City, (7) , Ed.] 70. I heard of a ghost coming in once - there was an old house - my moth er tole me this . They was a family that owned the home and they couldn 't rent it to anyone because people had gone there to live and wasn 't able to stay on account of ghosts. The last family that had any trouble , when they THEME OF went to stay there, the first night , a dog came in and walked around PROTEUS the room. They tried to chase him out and struck at him and he turne� into a cat. And they struck at it again and it turned into a hand,/a' human hand. The next time they took a knife and cut at it and actually cut :it then [drew blood] and then it disappeared and they never seen the ghost in the house evermore. [Ocean City , Md . , (18) , Ed. ; happened Mt . Olive , N. Car.] 71. I can truly say for myself that I have seen a spirit. I was lying in bed one morning and turned over and looked toward the door and there stood my father­in-law. I knew him well. I knew it was my husband's father. I said, \"Merciful Father ! Merciful! What does father Dempsy want?\" I didn't get MELTED AWAY frightened at all. I said, \"He has come for someone, I know.\" I never said anything at all to him, but when I kinda winked my eye I saw him go up - he melted away. I never saw no more of him after that. He looked just as he looked in life, only he was just wh ite. I told my husband about it, oh , I guess about three days after that , and he said , \"That's nothing strange to me . I'm with all of my dead ones most every night .\" He said, \"That don't bother me at all.\" And three months atter that my husband was taken seriously sick, and I said, \"Now I know he will never get up from this attack he had . Seeing father Dempsy, I know he came to notify me that he was going to take him away.\" It worked out just as I had seen it would. [New York City, (6) , Ed. ; near Elizabeth City, N. Car.} 72.

One evening between twelve and one he was on his way home, and as he was driving along the road - it happened to be rather lonely along this particular road - he saw a woman standing there and she acted like one of these hitch-hikers. And she waved her hand and so he stopped. He asked her where she was going and she told him this particular place. He told her he would take her along . So this lady got in the car and there was one peculiar thing ab out it, she wanted to sit on the back seat. The man noticed that and that she seemed to be rather nervous. The main th ing he couldn' t understand was why she wanted to sit in the back when there was plenty of room up in front. However, he told the lady to get into the car and he would take her to the place she wanted to go. So they drove along and he didn't say anything to her . Finally he arrived at this house that she had spoken of . So this man got out of the car and opened the back door of the car and looked inside and he didn 't see anyone there. Naturally he became very upset. So he went to this hous e and rang the bell. A man came down . So he told the man what had happened and the man didn't seem to be at all disturbed about it . And he said, IIThat was my wife who died sometime ago and quite a number of motorists have been annoyed by having her get in the car and when they arrive at my house she is not there.

I am j u st now thinking of the most wierd ghost story that I have heard tn recent years. There was a man enroute from Washing ton to Baltimore and on �/ way he overtook an old lady who was walking and carrying a basket. When-fie saw the old lady, the man stopped the car and asked the old lady her destination . She gave him a certain address in Baltimore . The man drove along with his pass­enger and just as he was reaching Baltimore he looked back and saw that there was no one on the rear seat. Where the old lady had been sitting there was nothing. The man of course was very astonished and wondered where the lady had disappeared because he had not stopped at all after he had stopped to pick the lady up. He hardly knew what to do. Finally, he decided to go to the address that the woman had given him to take her. When he reached the address the occupants of the house told him there was a woman who had once lived there by that name but that she had been dead three years. Of course the man did not explain what he had seen that day . [Ocean City, Md . , (18), Ed .; supposed to have happened in 1932, four years earlier.

So one day three preachers went there to see what was the trouble and so they viewed the place and the man likewise; and they decided that they would cut this log [cut out the piece of tree upon which he was lying] in order that they could move the man away . And when they began to cut, the log began to bleed; so therefore, they couldn't move this man and so they left him. That man lived according to my understanding about two months and nobody could move him off of that log .

I know something about spirits getting thirsty and coming and drinking. If you leave a g lass of water overnight, don't drink out of it next morning; for they say, when it sets all night, the spirits drinks out of it.

I only heard her story from my mother. They built their houses out of logs. There was ju st a front door. They had nothing on the floor but the dirt. The logs were laid BLOOD FOR THE SPIRIT close together on top of each other to form the walls. They didn't even have shingles then . The logs were hewed on each side and laid close together for the roof so the water would run off. Then they made little beds in each corner, like a shelf, near the ground. We would call them bunks . In one corner they would have for a table. The chimney was in the back of the house opposite the door. They had no windows . They [the chimneys] were made of clay. The clay was mixed up , pine straw put in it to make it stick. Just daub it. And they made the chimney like a pen with"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"34 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hya tt Foundation -small sticks, two rows going this way and one in the back, and this [the fourth or fron t side] was left open . That was the fireplace. When they got up a cer­tain distance [above the fireplace opening left in th e form] it was a pen with four corners. They made it as high as the house was. They filled it [the double walls of the pen] with clay and straw. In the fireplace was a iron oven and an iron pot. They had something in the middle of the firep lace [crane] they hung the pot on, with the fire under it. The oven had a iron door. The ovens were iron and made flat. They put bread in there and bake it, and potatoes. This house whenever it was completed they killed a calf. If they had sheep , they would kill a little lamb to let the blood go wherever it was killed, let the earth drink it up. This lamb was barbecued in front of the door. All of their friends and neighbors would come and have a feast there. They did that entering a new family to the house. They kill it right near the house. The blood wastes on the ground, the ground drinks it up, near the house they were dedicating to the family . Now that I have been reading the Bible , I can see that the olden peop le were taking that from the Bible . It was on th e lines of the Bible but they didn't understand it as they do today . The Israelites were told to kill a certain lamb and put i t on their door faces . The olden people were just doing it in their way the best they could. In our neighborhood [Orangeburg County , South Carolina] in erecting a home, building a new house to live in, you always are supposed in one of the front pillows [pillars] of the h ouse to fold the Holy Bible , wrap it carefully in oil cloth , that will protect it, put it in a stiff pasteboard, and lay it in th e holler [hollow] of the front pillow of the house. This is supposed to be a pro­tection s ent from God on your home. And you are supposed to live happily there. This is one of the customs . [New York City , (10), Ed.] 82. This happened in 1917 in th e City of Petersburg, Virginia, on Whych [1] Street in a section of the town called Glanville [ ?]. I was in the custom of coming home each nigh t -after finishing work -and getting to a particular corner and wait ing on a friend of mine. Then we would both proceed FOOTFALLS on until we got to Clutchfields Laundry. That's where another friend worked. Then the three of us would proceed on home together. This boy that worked at Clutchfields was killed in an automobile wreck . Several month s after , on a rainy night we were coming h ome and we heard footfa lls. They were following us. We looked and could not see anything. Then we thought th e reflection on the street lamps hid the person from our view. So we stopped and tried to look under the glare of the ligh t t o see if we could not see what it was that was following us. We didn't see anything. We walked a little further and we stopped again. As we stopped the footfalls stopped. We walked about three more blocks and these footfalls continued. They followed us until they got to where this boy always used to turn. From there we didn't hear it any more. �o I spoke of this when I got home to an old man, a man that had fought in the 9ivi1 War, and he said that's something people hear anyt ime.

Ah knowed a lady one time, her son he got killed on de railroad out here and nobody knowed how he got killed, and she always believe dat a fellah dat he had put in jail one time did it - see, had pushed him in front of de train. So she would go out to some grave ev'ry night and git at de head of BOTTOMLESS PIT dis grave and dig a hole right at de head of dis grave and put her hands down in dere and she would give all kind of prayers -prayers fer him to come back alive and haunt dis man.

Well, one night, he would sleep like, he would jest seem to go to sleep on de switch all de time and nearly wreck de trains all de time. See. And he never did befo', but nights she wouldn't go out dere, like nights when it rained, he would be all right. But ev'ry night she'd go out dere, he would always have some kind of accident happening to him. So one night she was there and he was walking down de railroad yard and she was out at de graveyard. People says she was out dere, dey'd seen her out dere, for she lives right cross from it, out heah on Union Street. And they said that he was walking down de railroad yard when he had stepped in a hole, a big deep hole, and he kept fallin' and kept fallin' and nevah seen him no more.

MOANING BONES So one night this boy had been out collecting bones and he had it in a crocus bag -that's the same as a potato bag [gunny bag or sack] - and he wanted to hide them, so he put them under his mother's bed. Around about midnight his mother and father heard a moaning and groaning all over the house. They couldn't locate it. They came back in their room and it was still moaning. So they looked under the bed and there was this bag. They pulled it out and the father shook the bones out on the floor and they were still moaning. That's the way he recognized them as human bones. So he woke his son up and made him take those bones out that time of the night. The next morning he asked him where did he get them from. He showed him. He tole him from now on don't never bring a bone from here near the house for this used to be a burying-ground. [Fredericksburg, Va., (54), Ed.; at Richmond, Va., 1911. My informant was the boy.] 88.

When I was a little boy [in 1860] I was praying an old-fashioned prayer the colored people used to pray. They went to the graveyard to get their souls converted. I went and prayed on a man's grave that was buried that day and I heard him moving and knocking on the coffin. I never paid no COFFIN KNOCK attention.

One d ay while he was sitting in this tree and watching his master's team while they grazed, the tree started to moan. He jumped out of the tree and ran into the house just as fast as he could.

Once an old man by the name of uncle Esham would go on a hunting trip every night, Sundays included. Friends tried their best to refrain him from going hunting on Sunday but the old man continued as if nothing was said. One Sunday night he heard a voice speaking from a tree, saying, \"Esham, Esham, what is the matter with you? You hunt Monday night, you hunt Tuesday night, you hunt Wednesday night, you hunt Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday night. Poor 'coons [racoons] can't get no rest.1I The old man would just listen and go on hunting just the same. One Sunday night when the old man passed be­neath the tree, not only did the voice speak to him, but when he looked around he saw red eyes, a man standing with his tongue out, pointing down the road. And he also said, \"Esham, Esham, what is the matter with you? You hunt Monday night, you hunt Tuesday night, you hunt Wednesday night, you hunt Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday night. Poor 'coons can't get no rest.\" Just as this was spoken the tree fell down and killed uncle Esham. He was found lying there the next day.

There are certain c ases where people actually tried to take this Bible out and the person claimed that it became so heavy that finally they would have to drop it before they got to the door. And on other occasions before, they claim that motorists who pass th ere in the evening see lights in the church and they can hear people talking and singing . [Ocean City , Md., (19), Ed. This church is midway on the road driving up from Berlin - on the left hand side of the road.] 126. This is about a old cemetery . It was on a farm in the State of Virginia below Suffolk. This farm was owned by a white man . His name was John H. He had four sons. They were very brave boys . They used to tell me of a light that would arise from the cemetery on a damp or rainy night. This light would go about four feet in the air and then disappear. They offered to pay me money to go there but I would not go. One offered me fi ve dollars to hang my hat on a tombstone but I would not do it. [Ocean City, Md., (14) , Ed.] 127.

If you see a l ight and you follow that light and keep on following the light, do you think you 're going to get to that light? You can't get to it. It's quite likely it's way out in the river and you'll walk overboard. If your parents are terribly, terribly sm art and they should look out JACK-O'-LANTERN at nighttime and see those lights, they said, \"This is a night for jack-o '-lanterns. I'm going to put an iron in the fire, my children are out,\" for feared they will get led off by jack-o ' -lanterns. They used to take a poker from the fire hearth . I put it right along these ashes in the fire and let it stay right there. It will make the jack-o '-lan terns vanish, they tell me. Keep it right there until the children get back. Of course after that they had nothing to worry ab out. [New York City , (6), Ed.] 129. What they tell me about a jack-o'-lantern, it's like a ghost, just as ragged as they could be. They carry a light, and they would lead you in the worsest briers and brambles they could find , and all through water to terrify you. They say they would laugh at you.

[An old woman (my informant) said that jack-o '-lanterns were little people, misshapen and browned-skinned who carried small lanterns with them at night while out hunting. The following day they spent their time cooking what had been caught the preceding evening. They never appeared during the day , and at night if you meet them they were harmless.] [I discovered after the informant had left that I had failed to record this information on the Ediphone - I wrote up the account immediately .] [New York City, (8) , Ed.] 132. A man followed one of those jack-o '-lanterns . He took him everywhere. It led him a mile through the brush and through the water. Yes , that's just what I was coming to.

But next mo rning when he w ent back he found the lump of jelly. [New York City , (5) , Ed.] 133. I've had jack-a-ma-lanterns after me right at twelve o'clock noon day. I had my horse and wagon in the woods - filled my wagon with wood. Starting out of the woods I seen a limb , a large limb . I got off the wagon, trimmed the limb up, cut it in two and three pieces, started back to the wagon. And I walked about five minutes looking for my wagon. I continued to walk. I lost my horse, wagon and all and didn't know where they were, and they wasn' t as much as twenty-five yards from me. I couldn't get myself together. I walked until I got out to the old field a nd I looked at houses I really knowed and I couldn't even recognize what houses they were. My horse nicke�ed in the woods and when he nicke�ed I came back to myself just the same as I had changed clothes. I went right to him, got on the wagon, and I couldn't find the limb . I was walking so long that I had thrown this limb down . So my mother told me that it was a jack-a-ma-lantern. [Old Point Comfort, Va. , (32) , Ed.] 134. I've heard my mother say , any time a jack-a-ma-lantern get� after you, you lay down or set down and they'll leave you. [Fredericksburg , Va. , ( 53), Ed. ] 135. If you meet a jack-a-ma-lantern, you pull off your coat and turn it wrongside out and put it on again; then he would drop into the ground, h�-�igbt wouldn't burn, and he would stop following you.

This was during the period of influenza [World War I] . It hap pene� between two women, both colored women, very superstitious. One had an argument with the other. One not wanting to get in a h eated argument started to walk away and she was feeling sick. That was the beginning of that influenza that was going around all over the country. .And this woman overtook her and started to fight and she pulled her hair and almost stripped her and she gave her a good beating . This woman turned around and said, \"All right, you may go , but I will get you . If I die I will come back and I will haunt you. I will get you.\" [This is another example of bad mouth. ] So they parted. The one that started the fight, thinking that she had the better hand, went merrily home , while the other went sadly home feeling sick from the pains of the disease and having got a good beating. That went on about three weeks without saying anything between them. The one that was sick soon died. The woman that had beat her made fun of her death . Many a month passed and she didn't give a thought to what this woman had told her. One afternoon she started to the store to get some coal oil , and -this was in a rural district where they did not have electric lights. She passed the cem­etery where this woman's body had been laid. She had a little child with her, a child of five. The child noticed it. There was something over on the grave the shape of a goat. The child said, \"Mother, look at the goat on Hanna ' s grave ,\" for that was the dead woman's name. The mother exclaimed to the child , \"Oh , come on, that isn't anything but the devil holding Hanna down .\" The child went reluc­tantly , passed the cemetery but hesitated [stopped] to look down before having gone too far that the cemetery might not be seen. They went to the store and purchased the oil and on the way back the child exclaimed again , \"Mother , there's the same goat on Hanna 's grave .\" The mother said , \"Oh , come on, I told you.\" She gave her a quick jerk. As she gave her the jerk there arose a whirlwind that twisted around the two of them. As it twisted around them it seem to grow hotter and hotter until it had thrown her down . After having thrown her down it continued to whirl , carrying them both within its grype [grip] . It twisted and turned them until the woman seemed to be exhausted . Finally, she lost consciousness. The child was afraid to leave its mother because darkness had almost covered the earth . The child stayed there until a passerby inquired why the mother was on the ground. Then the child ex­plained the whole detail to the passenger. They took the mother and carried her home and went for the doctor. And I drove the doctor there to the home of this woman. The story was told to the doctor while I sat and listened and as we came away from there I wanted to know from the doctor did he think that was true. The doctor being a very intelligent man , I thought he would tell me nothing b ut the truth . So he said to me that it was the most mysterious case he had ever attended. The woman seemed to be like scalding water had been poured over her skin. He doesn't know about [the truth of the] story because he wasn't there, but there was something mysterious ab out it. S everal times I inquired from the doctor and he wouldn 't discuss it very much because he didn't want me to think that he was superstitious , nor did he want me to think that he believed in spooks . Yet , I think that he believed very strongly in the story that this woman �-;-that it was a true experience. That was about 1919 near St . Petersburg, F�rida. The doctor was white. [Ocean City, Md. , (14) , Ed.] / 184. This story happened about thirty-two years ago [1904] at a church near Greenville, South Carolina, where we pastored [the informant's husband was pastor of the church]. We were having night services . When I got to the church door , myself and another member of the church that had called on me at the parsonage"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"52 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -that evening, they me t me, the officers of the church , and asked me to go back to the parsona ge and bring them another lamp. I said to the lady , you stay here, I will go back and get it. I went back, brought the lamp , we went in th e church . After services we call all the Christians to come and kneel around the altar. When we went up , this particular sister that had come to visit me that evening, she knelt down just in front of myself. Ab out the time she got settled down they commenced praying. We saw her begin to twitch around and to give away . People near her rose up, took hold of her, and they seemed to inves tigate . It seems that she had a partial stroke . They took her up , put her on a chair. Then the next thought was - the pastor said, \"Lets get the doctor to her.\" Then her hus­band said, \"No, lets take her to the doctor.\" They got her out, put her in a buggy, started to the doctor with her. My husband and her husband and two oth er men, when they got ab out twenty yards from church , there was a wh irlwind righ t in front of th em. And it crossed, went on the left side of the road, got in a tree and just wrung that tree , unt il, when they got by the tree, it was all they could do to get the horse by. My husband said that he was very frightened. But they went on to the doctor . When they got there the doctor s aid she had a partial stroke and to take her home at once . The home was two miles away. They carried her home. In an hour's time she could not walk. They sent back home for me. I went. Ab out daylight I got there and she could no t speak. In two hours after she took a very severe groaning and made such a noise. And the very wrestling, that they heard on going to the doc tor, was heard on the outside of the house. And she passed away in gr�at agony . [New York City, (10) , Ed.] 185.

I'll tell you what I have seen - twenty-eight years ago [1908] a cat behind a young woman and the young woman was kin'a intoxicated. There were two sisters. They lived together. One sister had gone out to a"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -61 party and the other one was all ready to go out. And this one, that hadn't gone yet, waited for her s ister to come in . She waited until eleven o'clock. CAT And it was in the sunnnertime . So she said, \"Mrs . Duke, will you take my key.\" - I said, 'Yes ' -\"to 'give to my sister when she comes, because I have been waiting for her. She h'asn't got here yet.\" So I said \"Very w ell, sure , I'll do that for you.\" I took the key. And her sister came in about one o'clock at nighttime and was rapping on her sister's door. I was in bed so I holler to her and say, \"Emma, \" I said, \"I have your key, your sister is out .\" She said, \"Very wel1.\" I g ot right up and opened my door and passed her the key. Meantime , t he cat got in behind her. I was trying to move back. I couldn 't move [the reason is given later] . She was trying to unlock the door but couldn't. She ha4 a little too much drink in her. I said, \"Emma, come on in my house.\" She said, \"No , I am going on in home. The door is a little hard to unlock .\" She unlocked it and went in . And she said , \"Cordelia, there's a cat over here. Is it your cat?\" I said , \"No, not my cat.\" She said , \"Yes .\" I said, \"No, Emma,\" like that. I said, \"Well, come on in my place.\" She said, \"No , no , I can't do that.\" So in the meantime she says, \"Here goes the cat. It's going out.\" But I am a little ahead of my story . During the time she was unlocking to get in, t his cat got very tired awaiting . And it turned three different colors while she was trying to get in ; one was yellow, the other was grey , the other was black - black and white. It didn't worry me about being a spirit. What came over me , I couldn't move. I said, \"Couldn 't it be the moonshinetl - it was nighttime - looking for the moon to see if it was reflecting on the cat. Had it of been the mo on I wouldn 't have been frightened. After I couldn't get a sight of the moon and co uldn't move, I was terribly frightened. And I never moved, couldn 't move, until she unlocked the door and the cat went in behind her. Then I went and got into my bed . This was on l15th Street [New York City] where I used to live . I never had the nerve to ask her; but one thing I do know, she never came to her sister's any more. In six months s he never came to her sister's house. She stayed around other people's houses further downtown . I said to her sister ab out the cat, \"There's a meaning to that.\" Her sister said , \"Don't mind that. That's only the devil after Emma.\" That was one sis ter speaking ab out the other. I knew is must have been a token . I asked a minister. The minister said , \"That cat was the devil shown to you because Emma has all the faith in the world in you. She is not a Christian . It was shown to you for you talk to her because she has lots of faith in you.\" Six months after that she died . [New York City , (6) , Ed .] 216 . This story that I am about to tell happened in New York [City] about two years ago [1934]. There was a black cat came to a lady and followed her home . She tried to keep him out . He followed her on into the house. To begin with she intended to get rid of him, but after he stayed for a day and a night, she liked him and she kept him. He was there about four weeks . The woman went away to Chicago to the big fair that was there and she took the cat , she carried it over, to another woman' s house to spend the ten days she was away. They took care of him over there. When she came back home, she sent and got this cat and brought it back. This woman's house she carried it to , her bro ther-in-law was living with her. Three days after the cat was carried back, this woman 's brother-in-law - he had heart trouble - that had kept it ten days, started upstairs. He got to the third floor, he lived on the fourth , dropped down with his cigarette in his mouth and died right there. People came up the stairs and found him with the cigarette still in his mouth and had to take it out to keep it from burning him.

They tell me the most lucky thing a person can get to guide him for one 's life or luck or love is to take the bones fr om the carcass of a black cat. Now, the way to find this bone is simply to get a solid black cat, a cat that hasn 't a particle of white about it , not even a strand of white hair. Take a boiling pot of water and put the cat in alive until all the flesh is boiled off the bones . Then take the bones and carry them in front of a mirror and look in that mirror, and put a b one in your mouth until it comes that you are invisib le in the mirror, then you put t hat bone aside. Then you put all the bones back and start to putting them in your mouth again until you can see yourself again reflected in the mirror. Then take those two bones and carry them to a stream of running water, and throw them over your left shoulder and run down the stream and catch them. Just where you catch them you take t hem and mark them, and carry them to a clear pool of deep water. And when you see yourself reflected in the water, you put the bone in your mouth until you can't see yourself. Put that bone in one pocket - either pocket. And put the other bone in your mouth, and when you come back visible again, you have the �o lucky bones. And you can do anything you want with them . You can walk right into a bank and they can't see you and you can take the money out . I know a boy that tried that at home and they put him in jail.

I heard of a man telling another man that, \"If you can get me a black cat - he must not have a white spot on him - and get him alive and bring him to me, I will get a certain bone out of that cat that will enable you to do anything you wish to do.\" SMOTHERED TO DEATH So the man said, IIWell, how will I manage to get the cat?\" \"When you are walking at night\" - you walk in a certain direction - \"when you meet this cat you won't see anything but its eyes. But when you see his eyes, open your eyes and stare into his eyes, and don't blink until you have caught hold of him. He will not move as long as you do not bat your eyes.\" When the man went out he met the eyes that the man told him he would meet. When he met them he did accordingly the way he was instructed. When he gazed into the eyes of this black cat he crept stealthily up to him without batting his eyes and grab him around the neck. Then he had him. He went on to the man with him which is supposed to be a eunjure. He took him to him. The man took him and wrapped him up carefully, smothering him to death with­out hitting him a lick. Then he was placed into a box and let remain there until his flesh rotted away. Then this man, which was the ounjure, was able to get all of the skelton of this cat without any strength being taken out by heat or by suffering - he was only smothered to death. It is said that a cat, especially a black cat, has nine lives. And it is stealthy. And in order to concentrate all of these qualities, that is why he was not hit, he was not cut. No violence was done to his body. He was only caught back of his neck, wrapped up carefully and smothered to death, so that all of his qualities were left in and went to the bones when the flesh decomposed. Then the man, it was said, got the bone that he wanted right between the two front shoulders and right do wn where the ribs of the cat joined from the back of his neck down his vertebrae. Those are the places that they say the vital bone are gotten that will enable you to keep with you to do anything you wish. Take this bone and wish whatever you want to and it will come to you.

But he insisted staying there and she jis' couldn't get away - see, he jis' forced hisself to stay in her house. And after he had been there a couple of days, she come in home one afternoon from her work, and there she discovered this man had company. And on the second afternoon that this fellah had been at her house she c ome in from her work, and her son and her both heard this laugh in , and talkin'upstairs.

And the next afternoon when she came in, her boy with her, they heard him a-laughin' and a-playin' upstairs. And when de boy went to see who was up there again and he had a great big black­snake on de bed playin' with it. Well, she asked him to leave again. But he laughed at her. So directly afterwards before she went back to her work, he came on out and went out, and she fastened ev'ry winder, locked ev' ry door in order that he couldn't git back in there. Well, when she came on back that night from her work he was right back in the house upstairs in his room. So then she began to think there was somepin funny about it.

So he took dis chest of money out - w ay out in dis big - had a big plantation. An' he took a Negro man out dere wit him - one of his best strongest Negroes he had on his place. Mah grandpa tole me about it . It took five or six b oys to lift dis big heavy chest out de wagon - two wheel�d wagon an ' set it on de ground. All right, now. He say he wrote his sons three names -only three boys he had living, on a piece of paper an' put it in dis trunk; wrote de boys names on a piece of paper, all three names yo' know, an ' put it in dis trunk.

So he showed John some­thing to ' tract his 'tention, jes' lak, \"Say , John, whut 's dat ovah yonder?\" An' quite natch 'ly when he looked to see, when John looked to see , why he pulled his pistol out an' shot him - see , shot him down over his money.

You take that paradise seed and you take you some parsley with paradise seed , you takes you nine rocks like off the railroad [bed of railroad track]. See. Tie that up into a sack. You put that, you understand , at your step but don't bury it - the same as you'd take a piece of stick thataway and tie it up on the side there. Everybody 'll pass there, even the children -they 'll look, their mind will tell them to stop there, but they'll continue by.

(Why is that?) Well, 'cause that money is there and the spirit is there and they have a g ood mind - t he spirit don't allow no one there, he's there to watch it . They'll h ave a mind - they 'll leave they house to go to that co rner of the yard but before they get there , they 'll go off. I saw the [this in ] natural life - the thing happened at a place in a swamp [a spirit guarded a tree ] -they had the skeeter pulling out some logs . There was a tree leaning towards the sunrise. They have a kind of a slot, look like , cut in the tree thataway -like it had been cut out of the tree, the tree was hollowed, and sot back in there again . [This treasure was buried in this slot.] Now , to make fast for the skeeter with that line , he 'd have to go and cut the top off that tree for the rigg er to tie his rigging there to pull the log with , and don't you know he couldn't go there. He put the axe on his shoulder and leave from the skeeter before he go there. He start thataway but before he get there, he come out the other way . So the white fellow said to him , \"Well, skeeter, what's the matter -going to keep me all day?\" Say , \"Well, I can't go there -get in there.\" It doing the same thing - they never get there - have to make fast somewhere else. (What's a skeeter -what 's his work?) That's pulling the logs out of the swamp, you see. They set here, y ou know, and they got a line pract' ly go to Canal Street - they got a line go to Canal Street, and they attach it to the top of the top bough of a tree. They got a bicycle runs on that cab le and they got a tong to hook the log . And , gee, hit pull logs and there's them logs flying up in there just the same as a bullet.

No , not dead people ; only the names of people living, they say , for witness to see it buried there. All these spooks around a-guarding of it, I could say they were alive.

So we came back the next night and after we came back the next night we dug . We left that fellow -we found out that fellow had been in trouble , so we left him and picks up another fellow. So we had a preacher with us and so he said a prayer . So we dug again until we got down to the money but there was so many different things come in front of us we couldn' t stand to see . First thing came, a horse with no head on it - a ho rse with a lot of fire coming out; a man with no head, and a lot of bells and noise. Well, we left it - we never did get it - a great big hole.

And ev�rybody who lived in that house, the ghost would meet them on the way to the s pring and would talk to them . This ghost would follow them to the spring and tell them about the money but they were afraid to talk to him.

After he would run around the tree a few times he would run down the lane and disappear. I would call my mother and sister and try to show them this man, but they would tell me that they saw nothing and would wonder why it was that I would say I saw something . One day when I was trying to show them this , my grandmother came to my rescue and said there was money buried there under that cherry tree , that a man who had been a soldier in the Civil W ar had buried it there, and there was no doubt that it was that man 's spirit who would appear to me every day , because maybe he wanted me to have this money . Later , my mother never consented to allow me to dig at this tree .

You go out on a clear night and a storm would come up . You're not supposed to say a nything. [Title Three Highest Names is informant's term, FA CI , 2ed ., 1965, pp.746, 787 etc.] [Place and informant number lost; by Ed.] 390. I'll tell you one thing that I have heard . A long time ago people used to bury their money instead of putt ing it in the banks . The person that buried the money believed that if they killed someone or an animal MONEY GOLD LIGHT and cut the animal's head off or the person's head off and bury the head with -the money that it would keep someone else from getting the money. At a place on the road [Maryland State Road No. 12] between Snowhill and Salisbury , near the Worcester County line, there 's a tree, an oak I think, where they claim that somebody was buried. And this man - this was before the Civil War , killed a little colored boy and cut his head off and buried it with the money . Later on people heard about this money being buried there and a number of them tried to get it. Everyone who tried to dig up this money never succeeded and the belief was that this head protected the money and kept the people from getting it. They claim that on certain nights, especially dark nights, people going along this road from Snowhill to Salisbury see a little light like and this light seems to flicker and it is near this tree. They claim that that 's the way you know money is buried there. Well, o ne man , I don't know whether it is true or not , tried to dig up this money . So he took some other man with him to help him. So they dug and dug under this tree and they almost got to the money and just as he looked up he claimed that he saw a sword suspended by a hair from the limb of the tree and he claims that he heard a voice say, \"If y,?u touch the money the sword will drop.\" His companions also saw and heard the same thing and they left him and ran away. But he stayed as long as he could but it seems that something was holding him back all the time . But he didn't get t his money . One night [1935] I was driving along that way and it was a very rainy night and dark and it seemed as though we could see this light twinkling . It might have been my imagination. They called it the money goLd Light. [Ocean City , Md ., (19) , Ed . ] 391. Gwynn's Island [Gwynn on maps ], it 's up the [Chesapeake] Bay about forty-five miles up . A man there goes into the woods and by him going into this woods he see some trees , and these trees look like they was in a TREE AND MOSS diff' rent form from the others. There was a lot of green moss and by this green moss being there he goes to work and commence, diggin g. He dug up a chest of money. [Old Point Comfort, Va . , (32) , Ed.] !"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"118 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -392. I heard one time that a man went out in the woods , he went out to dig some money and while he was out there digging - four men were out there digging -a woman came and sit by them all in white. The one that was reading the Bible -he got frightened and started to run. When he started to run the fellows what was digging started right behind him. When he got out on the road - the spirit had left them out in the woods and run ahead of them . They managed to get by some kinda way . One of the men he lived in the country , he was quite old, and the three young men left him behind . When they got up to the house he [the old man] was sitting on the porch laughing and talking . So then they decided to go back and fastened this hole up . They went back the next day and th ey claim they couldn 't find this place when they went back. Tbis was out in a hickorynut woods right near a big tree with moss allover it and they had a stick there. They say wh en you mark a place and go back you won't see it no more at all. That was just about three miles from Hampton.

Now, another thing , in the fork of the road - for instance, we was g oing to a buried treasure, and when we got out to that buried treasure, the forces was so bad whensomever we would start making our surrounding TROUBLE FROM SPIRITS round dere, why we couldn't get a chance to work on account of the evil force.

Well, some of 'em use what you call grigri [or greegree] out of candy and diff' rent things of that kind. [New Orleans, La. , (819) , 1169:5.] 394. When they go to diggin ' they say there's always something in the hole, a snake or a scorpion or something in there to try to scare them away; but if you keep on diggin ' they'll go away and leave you be and you can continue to get the money .

[The informant's father, a clergyman, frequently attempted to locate hidden treasure at the request of both colored and white people. The fact that he had been born with a veil (caul) assisted him in this work. He employed the following method:] He used a switch . I think it was a willow switch . It was two branches out from the tree with an end on them like a wishbone. He put some kind of silver thing [holder] around that part [the jointure of the fork] . Then he put a hole in the top of it so money could fit in it, ab out the size of a quarter. It had to be silver money. You take each handle in your hand and you just hold that steady and follow it where it leads , because it will lead anywhere money is -not paper money, silver and gold. You walk and when you get to the money , it [the fork] will turn down [see No . 400]. [New York City , (1) , Ed.] 402. I know a story about fellows went hunting hidden treasure. It had been once dug up by a steam shovel and it slid away back in the dirt again. In way­back times they use to always kill a man. They get the hole pre pared and put the treasure in, then they would ask him if he would take care of this money . He wouldn't know what was going to happen . He would tell them, \"Of course.\" Then they kill him and turn him over in the hole and cover him up . Then, when you go there, that 's his spirit that takes care of the money, and it does things to frighten you so you won't bother it. They are supposed to have a machine. It 's a round thing like a c lock a nd has three points sticking out. One was set for gold, one for silver and the other for brass . It has two handles of hickory . You hold them two handles and walk along Zike you witch for wat�r. When you walk over hidden money one of them points goes down. As soon as you start to dig, no talking. You use signs . If you talk, it slid away in the dirt. Well, five men went hunting it again, that's after it was dug up by the steam shovel and slid away, and as soon as they hit the old chest that was in the ground, the wind begun to blow, the trees began to weep -they rocked like they were just 60ing to blow over. And the men begun to run. One got lost. He stayed all night and began to see every kind of a thing like a ghost -men walking, men flying, beasts in the air. He never discovered the way out until daylight appeared. And he has been afraid of it ever since. I knew this man. That happen ab out thirty years ago [1906] in Sussex County, Virginia.

Another fellow and I went out one night to try and locate a hidden treasure. And after getting to the place, he drew a circle around it and made a gate to it. And after leaving the gate he sprinkled sulphur, milk and so forth all around, and then he began to sound with his apperrattox [apparatus] and he struck what he thought was money. That was a iron rod ab out six feet long . And we began to dig . And while we were digging -I had never been upon that occasion [adventure] before in my life - you can't talk - whatever you want y ou must make signs - and I was digging and I held up my head to ask him for something to work with, and I looked and he was gone and I was all there alone . The ring which he made was surrounded by lots of people, but who they were I know them not. And all I had to do then was to come out of the hole and make my getaway - and I beat it, too .

They wasn't positive sure it was there. And they appointed a night that they would go and try and see if something would happen. The leader was a woman. And when they got there they stop and draw a large circle on the ground. They drew that circle right around the money, where they had ideas to believe that it was there. And they was to come inside of that circle . And there must not be any conversation here at all inside of that circle. So she [the leader ] said , \"Lets try it .\" And so they got inside of that circle, and she took her stand about here, [demonstrates], and she was reading a lesson from the Bible. After that was over they had to go to work. She put her spur [spear] down into the ground , a rod , a money rod, right in the center of the circle.

He come to New Orleans to see one of these wizards as they call them [never so called], or either fortune-tellers or hoodoos, and he was talking to the proprietor, M r. Smith, relative to having someone who knew New Orleans who would take him around. He [Smith] told him he knew a young man who was in school at Leland University, and that he would possibly be there and that he was just the man he was looking for. So, while they were talking, I happened up th at afternoon . I simply happened up and Mr. Smith says, \"Here's the v ery man we was talking about\" - introduced me to him and said , \"This is Mr. Scott from Moundville and he wants to go with someone who knows New Orleans, to go about with him. 11 Well, first thing he explained the nature of his business to me, a nd said whatever ah charged him for mah time , he would give it to me. He was looking for a man that would help him to find some money that was supposed to be buried on his premises, on his property . The first thing he wanted to do was to find him some of those barrooms where he could find him some gin , and he claimed that gin was lucky to him , and after clearing about a quart of this gin -drinking it -why we went round sight-seeing in New Orleans and visited a deal of places up until about possibly ten-thi rty or 'leven 'clock t hat night. Then we went out , way out Bienville - near Ga1vers Street - w ay out - seventy-five blocks away, possibly - way out in New Orleans , way out to Bienville Street - dat's about two blocks from Canal Street, parallel to Canal Street. We got out there, ah suppose about ten-thirty or 'leven 'clock and knocked on a door and dey -mostly all downtown houses in New Orleans have dese blinds and shutters, and de people is very superstitious - it' s a very hard matter to find anybody round New Orleans . If you knock on a person's door and dey'll ask you who you looking for and sometimes you's talking to dis party, and dey won't answer you. And if dey are somewhere else in de house dey'll call 'em and perhaps yo' gone, and if you wa nta see dat person perhaps they'll call you back. So [before] we went in and - his wife said, \"Oh , sure it's you , Percy?1I Ah said, \" Yes.\" She said, \"Come on in.\" Ah said, IIAh got company, someone to see Professor Frank.\" She say, \"Why he 's in bed asleep .1I Ah said , \"Well, this is rather important and I would be glad should you call him . \" She say, \"All right.\" So she went and called Professor Frank and he came out dressed in a very gorgeous robe, seem'ly made of red velvet a nd large arms - had a cap on same as that which a priest wears, and had dis man to come and kn eel. [Since I did not ask for a description of this cap \"same as that which a priest wears,\" I evidently assumed that it would be a biretta rather than a zucchetto and that the color would be black; this article and color being more accessible to him at a Roman Catholic religious shop . But I had not yet visited New Orleans and had much to learn - the aap was probably r ed.] De room was lighted with two large candles on either side of the mantlepiece -red candles - de carpet on de floor was red , and then th ey had a large altar over in de corner. It seem to set the room off katycornered, a nd there w as a stool [prie-dieu] by which a man could kneel down upon as the people do in some of the churches to pray.

Then he mumb1e�/ some w ords, turned his back to dis man and looked up as in meditation and mumbled something and turned and told him dat he would seek what he was 100kin' fo '.

It had a large gold and silver horseshoe mingled with seem'ly various colors - ivory . (You spoke of that awning [his word] being held up, yesterday.) Yes, this awning [canopy] o ver the altar was caught up right in de center in front, seem'ly by dis horseshoe and den draped down to a point on either side and went almost round de - in fact, it covered de altar . This altar was made very similar to that of a pulpit - s uppose it was about two and a half or th ree feet and about eighteen inches wide - something like dat - and he stood with dis heavy robe on him - this large robe girded round him in fringes on de end. (It was the kind of a robe that a priest throws around him?) Yes sir . And he had the bottom of his hand up this way - his right hand - he was seated in front of a table. Now dis table was something similar to a living­room or a parlor room mahogany table, seem'ly about four feet possibly and about eight een inches in width, very heavy carved, de legs - I didn't say dat yesterday but it was large ole antique furniture. On this table was a large red covering with fringes that went up and down in the center. It didn't exactly cover the table. On this table was a large reading lamp with a shade seem'ly probably of gold, and he went behind dis table and sit down in large reclining revolving chair. But before he sat down in this chair - no, after he sat down in de chair, he pulled out a drawer in dis table and got out a kind of pipe - seem' ly it was gold - had a little crooked pipe stem to it [surely a calabash - my first pipe] -got some what we call moss tobacco or cut-plug - something similar to cut-plug tobacco and filled his pipe with tobacco continuously looking at this man, who sat dere and seem'ly half out of his wits and tremb ling - looked upon dis man as some supernatural being or some man dat was extraordinary - out of the ordinary person. He continuously looked at him searchingly , and dis man wou ld look up at him guardedly . After he had filled his pipe with tobacco, still looking at dis man, he got out a - out from underneath his robe - the robe was lined with heavy satin - ah don' t think I said that yesterday - he pulled out dis gold match­lighter and some way pushed a spring and out come a blue flame which seem'ly had something else in it - resembled that of lightning - still continuously looking at dis man. After lighting his pipe, put this cigarette lighter out and stuck it back in his pocket. He sat down and looked at this man and told him what he came there for. First he told him that his mother was dead and that he lived with his father; that he was in a business and that he was very successful in this busines$, and he had a large amount of money and had come to New Orleans looking for him and that he would find there was heap much money on this property of his buried. Seem'ly it was probably buried there by the Indians who seem' ly had formerly owned -lived in that settleme�t before it was thickly inhabited or populated. (Then he s ent you away for the night, didn't he?) Yes sir . He had us to leave with t he understanding that at ten 'clock de next morning he would come back and not say a word to anybody and bring $75 with him, which dis man did. We meets at de hotel and de next morning ah brought him back , since he didn't know New Orleans , and we came back - made it our business to be there exactly at ten 'clock. Came there and then he took him in his back yard. They had a rod that resemb les a lightning rod, something like a lightning rod. (What was the shape of this rod?) Hit was round and at the ends it went down in an inner case and was made so it went down in an inner case and was made so it would go up and down at a certain length, a certain depth. (Yesterday you said it was like a drill.) Yes sir - it was like a drill in one end and it was curved like curved wire -"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -like a curved lightning [rod] wire. (How long was it?) Oh it was possibly -probably six feet near as ah kin judge. 131 And he went in his back yard and had some wires attached to it [the drill] -he apparently had these wires [also attached] on de wall of his house [in] back­yard, but it seems he attached them to some other wires connected with, possibly the electric wires, and place this machine out in de middle of de yard . Had it to drill itself - worked it a certain way that it worked itself down in de yard, and stood off from it, waved his hand like magic and s aid some peculiar words three different times, and then flames of fire like lightning flamed up at the top of [this] rod - flamed up three different times at de top of this rod. Well, the man as well as mahself, we stood there amazed because it was - well, now you understand it. We, w hen we went out of his house -dere was a little alley between his house and the next house -the houses in New Orleans are built very closely together -went out in the street and right in front of his home was a gutter .that jes ' carries off the water , a ditch , very seldom cleaned out and there was water in it, stopped up - stagnant water dere most all de time. Stuck dis rod down in de water , but he never left the rod off the wire as he went through the yard - that wire was coils you know. (He kept on to this wire - the wire was still attached to the house?) Yes sir - still attached to the house and he uncoiled it· as he went on through the alley and sent this same rod - it was made to go down in de ditch of water , and said those same w ords he said in th,e back yard and waved his hand over this wire and then the flames came up seem'ly out of the water through this wire. Jes ' h ow it was [done I] don't know [!!I]. But after that he said to this man that regardless of where dis money was buried, if it was an old well, if it was in water anywhere, or it was on dry land, dis machine would be sure to find it. And this man gave him the $75. He gave him that when he first went in the house the second day. And he was to go to this man's home at Moundville, Alabama - this side of Tuscaloosa, Alabama , up on de Alabama Great Southern Railroad between Meedan [?] [Meridian , Mississippi] and Tuscaloosa [Alabama] . And sometime that afternoon they left all of a sudden for Moundville where he was supposed to go to find dis money. (This man went with him?) Yes sir, this man went with him.

Well, because de religious idea seem'ly is borrowed from de Catholics who burn candles in their religious ceremonies . A deal of dese peop le are persuaded, some of them are Catholic persuasion and some of them belong to the Catholic Church .

The people around New Orleans , wh ite and black, around certain districts use that in scrubbing their doors teps and houses, and even pouring this van-van which is very expensive oil -perfumed oil in the water with which they scrub their floors and even sweept off the brick pavement around their doors. They claim that it brings good luck. Racehorse men and racehorse women who play lots on racehorses are known to use this perfume greatly on their clothes . It's a very frequent thing to meet people with their clothes highly perfumed with this van-van odor. (You were telling about the women in the fast houses ; do they use that in some way?) Yes sir - very much so. How do they use that? They use it perfumed in their bath water - they use it also in having their maids to scrub their houses. It's also used in these candles . Some of these candles that they burn, they are very expensive and they are perfumed. They burn that candle and practically shut that room up practically all day .

I knew of an old man a nd he used to live at northwest Berlin [Maryland] and he was alone, and a woman stayed with him keeping house. And so she used to watch him at night and she said he would go to an old WITCH TAKES OFF HER SKIN wooden chest, and she would play that she was asleep, and he would go to de chimney, a old fireplace chimney and outten he would go up de chimney. She said she would lay there and sometimes would drop off to sleep for an hour or two. After awhile she would hear somepin scuttering. Down the chimney then he would come and go to this old box. [Tyree Church, Md., (12), Ed.] 440. The old people tell this, that they [witches] take something, put on de hand and rub under their arms, went and smoothed it back of the chimley and say, \"Mount devil and fly.\" And out their skin dey went.

Dey went tuh work after he come out of his skin, in order to ketch him so dey would know whether it was de man who was haggin' de people. [This is the only time I heard the verbal form of hag.] They took salt an' peppah an' p ut it in his skin, and when he come back an' pick up his skin - started to go back in it, it would burn him. He had a way of sayin', \"Skin, skin, do yo' know me? Skin, skin, do yo' know me?\" An' dey say his skin would crawl right back ovah his body an' he'd become all right. But the folks caught him with his triak by putting peppah an' salt in his skin, and dey find dat dat wus de man whut was haggin' de people. [Sumter, S. Car., (1381), 2352: 1. ] 443. I often hear people say a witch will ride yo'. Well, some people say, \"Oh, dat's\" [fogyism] - all right. So she goes in de room one night an' put her some salt right down by dis boy's bed.

[Old Point Comfort, Va. , (32), Ed.] 447. This is a story I used to hear my grandmother tell. There was once an old witch who used to go out every night. So one night she went out and jumped / out of her skin and left it hanging on the door. So some of the folks in her// house salted it and the next morning she came in late and jumped into her skin and it stung her so she jumped out and say, \"Lookee here, old skin, don 't you know me?\" And she jumped in again and out again and say , \"Lookee here, old skin, don't you know me?\" So at last it worried her so she died .

It was suppose to happen there home in the country. She was suppose to be a witch. That was years ago. My father used to tell us about it to scare us. I used to be a-scared to look out of the door at night, thought I would see her standing there out of her skin. At a certain time in the evening she would go about what they called witah-riding. Dem days witah-riding is what we call these days stagnation of the blood. Why I said that - when I came out of a operation in the hospital I saw about one thousand cats. The cats just clawed me. I woke up trying to get away from them cats. This witch would get out of her skin and go to somebody's place at night when they were asleep and ride dem. They would see things, just lak dem cats I told you about. She did that every night. Some­body said to find out where she lived and go where she lived and put salt in their skin. They leave their skin behind when dey go out, get right out of it. I d on't know how they found out where she lived. When she came back to go into this skin she couldn't get in it. They must never let the light [dawn] catch dem without being in their skin - they will die sure. She couldn't get into the skin and dey say she went down [to the river] and jumped overboard. [New York City, (4), Ed.; Norfolk Co., Va.] 450. There was a old witch. She said, \"I'm g on'a get out of my skin and when I come back I will get in my skin.\" She lifted it right off like this [informant demonstrates, putting her hands to her shoulders and taking hold of the skin, lifted it off as she would her nightgown]. If you haven 't anybody wise enough, she can go and stir up trouble. One time when she was out of her skin they put salt in it and when she got back she said, \"Oopl My skin doesn't know me.\" She couldn't get in it. She died. [New York City, (5), Ed. Informant, 13 when Civil War began, said she had heard this story near Woodville, Miss., as a child in slavery.] 451. I've hear'n about one getting out of his skin and couldn't get back in. That had been going on for a long time. They had been missing some of the food, so they decided they would really watch to see. So this old man came in. They said he commenced to shake and shake like that [twisting his shoulders]. They said they were a-watching of him and they said he got out of his skin. They said he looked to be putting something [grease] on himself. I don't know what he put on. And they said when they came to look at him, sure enough, he pull it off and laid it aside, then he commenced going allover the pla�e and getting ever what he wanted. In the meantime some of t hem said to put pepper and salt in that skin. They said he couldn't get back in. The last they saw of him he was saying, \"Skin I Skinl Don't you know me?1J That's the last they saw of him. Then they left. They were sc ared to hang around for fear he might do them some harm. That's the end of it as far as I know. I was a small child when I hear'n that. That was seventy years ago [1866]. [New York City, (6), Ed.; near Eliza­beth City, N. Car.] 452.

Just at once somebody shook her and she came to her senses and the witch was gone. [Fredericksburg, Va., (38), Ed.] 454. Once upon a time dey said there was an old woman and there was a certain family that was always pestered with what they called nightmares or hags. They called it hags in those days. Some people would get 'em. It seems it would bear on 'em so hard until they would just holler in their sleep. It was called a hag. And so, once upon a t ime , an old woman came and she said to the other woman, \"You know what you do? You sprinkle salt all around your bed and later on you'll find out what that is that's bothering you.\" So that night the woman sprinkled salt all around her bed. She got in her bed. At the usual hour this thing came and she got all overpowered with it. She jumped up in her sleep and when she jumped up there was a man standing there. And he said, \"Skin! skin! You don't know me! Skin I skin I You don't know mel\" So the woman caught him. And it was some man that she knew that was a witch. And he pulled his skin off and laid it down, then torment her. When he got ready to put it back on that night, it had salt on it and he could not put it back on. They said they caught him and tortured him and really destroyed him, because this other witch instructed them how to catch him. [New York City, (10), Ed.; Orangeburg Co., S. Car.] 455.

That was right over de horses stabl�/ So we opened both doors [of the 10ft] and there is where we laid. So each of us went to sleep. And at one time he was asleep and I was awake, and I heard the horses scrumbling in the stable. What was the matter I"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"142 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -did not know. So finally, I got up and went downstairs in the stable , and when I got down there, the doors was open and the horses were out in the yard running to and fro . But what was on the horses I know not . I did see that there was a little knot upon their manes up around the shoulders. They tie this knot in his mane and use it as stiprups [witches' stiprups] and ride it until it drops dead . When we got the horses in the stab le the horses were all wringing wet . [Old Point Comfort, Va., (27), Ed .; Norfolk Co. , Va., 1929 .] 458. My father had a grey horse at home. He bought him from a very old man and this was his [the old man's] riding horse. Ev' ry morning he would find two little stiPrups tied in his mane. The horse wouldn 't get fat . Ev'ry morning my father would comb that all out nicely. each night when we get through feeding, and the next morning those two little knots would be tied in there. You would hear the horse groaning and groaning at nighttime. Someone told us that the old man was riding the horse and to turn the horse around the other way in the stall. After that the horse got all ri ght. It was that old man . It was sold in his estate and he didn't want anyone to have it. [Fredericksburg, Va. , (57), Ed.] 4�9. I had a horse that was real poor with a long mane. I combed that mane out every morning. I would get up the next morning and it was all tied up with stippups from witches riding him. It looked like the more I fed him, the horse kept getting thinner . I told him what to do . I told him to go and get him a broom , drive a nail up behind the stable door, hang this broom up there. If this witch comes there, she has to count every straw in that broom before she can get a ride, then day will be on her and she will have to leave. [Fredericksburg, Va. , (57), Ed.] 460. Now , I have seen this. I can say this. My uncle had a horse, a little black horse. He did dray work around the streets, hauling trunks and boxes and things for folks in town. And I've had him come and show us dat horse any number of mornings . She'd be soakin ' wet , hardly could move de next day . And he'd show it to me for the fact and say to me, \"De witches has rode dis horse las t night.\" And then he has also showed me her mange [mane] de next day. It would be all p1aded [p laited] up where they had developed over night. Now, what did that? (Was there any way to protect the horse?) No . De only thing , he had horseshoes stuck up over de doors. [Princess Anne, Md ., (125), 36:1.] 461. In 1877 I lived wit a man by de name of Mr . Charlie B. My father hired me there for carrying water for de women folks and bringing in kindling and stuff for the women. I was eleven years old and a little ways into tw�lve. A man from Snow Hill by the name of Mr . John S. - and in that time a horse and carriage was de fastest way to get along - he had a bay horse, come to Mr. Charlie B. And this horse, one day his mane was all tangl ed and mingled. And he wanted to lick me over it. Mr . Charlie B. told him , \"No, that boy ain't bothered that horse, because my horse is so often like that when I go to take them out . And I know he didn't bother him.\" And he saved that man from cracking me. If you want to keep the witches from tangling them, you nailed a horseshoe right over the barn door with the points down to keep the witches from riding the horses . [Tyree Church, Md., (12) , Ed.] 462. They claim that a witah-hag would go to a stable and get a horse and get on his back backwards and come to your house and go through the keyhole while you were sleeping and ride you to death. That is [now] called stagnation of the blood. [Hampton, Va. , (25), Ed. ] 463. I remember one night I was living on a farm all alone. Whilst being there, I had been told that this place was witchy , so I minded it not. So I went there to live . And after staying there for a period of time a witch came to my"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -143 home. And I was told how to capture this witch. So I captured this witch. So after capturing this witch I had her on my way to the stable and she turned into a horse, a beautiful grey nag. After I put her in the stable, I was so delighted with my new horse that I hardly could sleep. I wanted day to come so bad so I could go down to the blacksmith shop and have my nag shod all round. So finally, the next morning - I stayed all night by her in the stable - a nd the next morning before breakfast I take my nag to the blacksmith shop and had her shod all round. After she had been shod I carried her back to the stable and put her up in the stable. One of the neighbors round there had taken violently ill. What was the trouble, no body knowed. So they sent for the doctor. The doctor came. I told the doctor about my new pony. So I went to the stable to get my nag to show the doctor and when I got there de nag was gone. When I heard of th is neighbor being so sick, deathly ill, I went to see her. And when I went to see her she refused to let me look at her hands and also her feet. I persisted on doing that and den I got help so I should examine her. After I examined her I found she had horse­shoes on each feet and on each hand. She was deathly tormented with those nails. She had den turned to a natural human form. (About 1886, near Hampton, Virginia. This is an example of a folktale told as a personal experience.) [This is my comment in 1936, after informant left room.] [Hampton, Va., (27), Ed.] 464. I heard of a man, his wife she would go out hag-Pi ding every night. And that night when she came in, her husband was in the horse stable when she brought the horse in. And when she opened the door he cut her finger off WITCH'S RING with the ring and he got that. She would go to the stable and get the prettiest white horse he had in there. And when he cut her finger off it dropped and he got the ring, she rushed to the house. And when he went in she were in bed. Next morning when he got up she had her finger tied up. So he asked what was the matter with her hand. She said she cut it. So then he asked her where was her ring. And then she said her finger was sore and her finger was gone. So then he asked her where was the finger. She didn't know where the finger was at. So he taken the finger and ring and showed them to her and told her, \"This is the ring I gave you. You've been out hag-Pi ding with my horse. I were in the stable when you came in. You don't need to worry because I'm going to kill you.\" And he killed her. [Hampton, Va., (31), Ed.] 465. An old lady one time, her husband had give her a gold ring. She use to go out every night witah-piding. So that night when she went out and when she got out of her skin, she left her skin laying on the floor. So while she was gone her husband came home and he saw this skin on the floor. And he picked it up and he recognized the ring on it. So he took the ring off and put it away. So when she came that night and was in bed - no, he didn't say anything to her that night. So the next morning when he got up he asked her where was the ring. She said she had put it away. He told her to go and get it. She never did go and get the ring. So finally he asked her at midday to get the ring again. And she wouldn't get it. So the next night he asked her again where was her ring. And she wouldn't get it. So then he took the ring out of his pocket and asked her what was it doing on there with her skin. So he found out that she was a hag-pidep. So then he burnt her up. [Hampton, Va., (31), Ed.] 466.

He give them some matches to make them a fire he give them some potatoes and said they could roast them if they wanted to. 'They made a fire and roasted these potatoes. Something came down the chimley and scratched the fire out. They had nerve enough to make the fire again. They scratched the fire out again. They decided they wouldn't make the fire again.

[Fredericksburg, Va., (74). Ed.] 468. I remember one time about a shoemaker. He had a wife and three children. And one night this shoemaker was at his work late. So another woman went to the shoemaker's wife's h ome and began to talk to her, and as they began to talk, one says to the other, \"Leave us transform ourselves.\" And they did so. And they turned to cats and went down to the shoe shop where her husband was working. And after they got there they set and watched him work on the shoes. And one of the cats pawed at this man, and while she did it, he grabbed a shoe knife and hacked at this cat with the knife and cut one of the eat's forefeet off. He left it standing there and the cats went away and he didn't see them any mo re. While he was at his work, the foot being lying on the floor, he got ready to go home. He picked up the foot and looked at it. And while he had it in his hand the foot turned to a natural hand. And on this hand was a ring. It was the engagement ring he had gave his wife before he married her, not knowi ng that he had married a hag. [Old Point Comfort, Va., (27), Ed.) 469. I heard a story of a man who had a mill.

Finally the cat continued to do so and he kinda got angry and took his knife and when the cat grabbed at him again he chopped off his paw. When he chopped off the paw the cat disappeared. He was holding the paw of the cat and it turned into a w oman's hand. So he decided to investigate. Next day he heard of this woman being sick who he knew. So he decided to visit her.

Seems if - she had a niece that, why she had raised , and this young man you know had visited her [ t he niece] once or twice and he liked this other girl better than he did her , and someone had circulated the news that they were married , going to marry. And this girl [niece] got sick, and then when she began to get better , why then this witch commenced to bother her . And sometimes you could be set tin' beside of her bed and you could hear just like someone came in the door, but the door would still be shut. Sometimes the door would shake and the people would say it was the wind. And then you would hear her keeping [imitating?] the noise - s ee if it would go away. She 'd say , \"That witch pest is after me ,\" says, \"there she go.\" And so one night we said we were going to stay there and watch - I was always like a little curiosity. So we said we were going to set up and watch for her that night. So they heard 'em say you could hang a sifter over the door, you know, or over your bed , and the witch couldn 't bother you because it had to count all those holes, and before they'd get through counting those holes it would be , dawn. So we hung the sifter up and then they crossed nine needles and nine pins in the back - said they would stick in her when she come d own the back of the fireplace. (Where did they cross these needles and pins?) In the back of the fireplace - you know, the fireplace that has the little shoulders , two of them. And you cross them , you see, and they gets hot. And they took a horseshoe and hung up over the door [demonstrates] -see, that will keep evil ones out. (They hung it with the open part up - I see.) Yes - see they hangs this horseshoe with the open part up . Say , long as that horseshoe up over the door with the open part up - and we 'd taken and got us a box of new cayenne pepper and a box of salt and a box of sulphur , and we mixed that together and put some of that in a thin bag or a piece like mosquito lawn, so it would just set right down over the door, and anyone come in , see , opening the screen door, why that would touch it , you see . Well, they say a witch, you know, doesn't have any skin on , you see , and if that salt and pepper gets on 'em, ! /"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"162 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -you see, that will hurt them. And so then we all goes in de room and lays down and we leaves de door open a crack so we could watch her bed , and so we fixes de light out there in her room. And so we takes some Sunday School books - a man told us to take some Sunday School books and Bibles and turn to a certain chapter in de Bible , but have de whole nine chapters - books of de same chapter and lays 'em open -said , and she would come and we could see her in person. Said the person -(They used nine books?) Uh-huh - there wouldn't be any way fer her to get on de bed . (Nine books of what - nine different Bibles?) Nine Bib les, all the same chapters - see, use those Sunday School books or whatever books you can; little Bible stories that have the same chapter, just like the 15th Chapter of John , you see, or the Psalms . Well, you see, we had difficulty in getting nine Bibles and they us ed Sunday School books with them . And you take those Sunday School books, and you just lie them down , you see, on de side of de bed and one to the head of de bed and one to de foot and then she takes the Bible , you see, and lies that right 'cross her breast. [Nine Bibles should be used - three on each side of the bed, one at head and foot of bed , and one on the breast; the latter must be a Bible. These nine books are unevenly, odd-numbepZy placed.] And so , we hadn 't j ust finished fixing that and been in the room more than thirty-five minutes before she says , \"Here she is\" - says, \"here's Miz So-and­So\" - says , \"here' s Miz So-and-So.\" She said that she made a shadow between her and de light . She says , \"Hurry up - she's done blowed out dat light -hurry up and come on out with a lamp -she's done gone and blowed out de light .\" The lady [aunt] she says , \"No , she ain't.\" \"That was her shadow,\" says [bewitched woman] , \"that's her\" - s ays, \"that 's her - the light's not out - that's her - she's in between me and the light -ah thought mah light was out.\" And the door shook again , but we didn't fix b ut one door, and then she come in the back door. There was two back doors and a shed on the house, a nd we didn't fix both of those back doors because it usually been the front door, see, where we come in to, the nearer the girl's bed -see , the bed was like there and we fixed the door there, but we didn't fix these two back doors. So, when she went through this door it just shook , and the back door just opened and shut , and we opened the door - opene d the inside door and it looked just like looking out through her kitchen door, and it was still so just like we left it. (Did you see anything at all?) No , we didn't see anything , but she seen it . [Elizabeth City, N. Car., (438) , 409 :3.] 543. Her daughter wouldn't let her be shrouded. (Well, why wouldn 't they let her be shrouded - what' s the idea of that?) Well, they said people would find out where she was . (Oh , I see.) You see, that was to keep people from finding - knowing where she was , and she had been shot in her hip, and she was crippled in her hip . Of course, you know, she wasn't shot person 'ly - she fell on the road and it [her hip ] broke , but they said a man had drew her pitchure in the woods , you know. He had a little store and each and ev 'ry night someone would go in there, you know, and get things outen the store and he couldn't see nowheres they entered. So a man [doatop] told him one day what to do to prevent 'em - s ays , \"Now, you put a hacksaw in there [storeroom? or keyhole?].

I don't know now what you use it for.

And she says , \"Ah been here waiting and waiting fer you fer hours.\" [He] says she just hollered at him . [She] says , \"And ah want some matches. I can't make a fire,\" she says , \"and cook me and my children nothing to eat .\" He says , \"Well, I'm sorry , I haven't got no matches ,\" says , \"I 'm started d own to the post office and I haven 't got time to go in the store . I'm in a hurry.\" And he went right on . Ooh , they says she just shook and she ran on then and started running home . So he went on back to the house -instead of keeping on to the post office , he went on back to the house. And he'd always heard that you could draw a person if you [the person] was a witch and draw dey pitchure on a shingle , or eitherwise on a cake of bread , you k now, like people used to bake bread to a fireplace , fZoup bpead. I don't know whether you 've heard talk of it but they could. (FZoup bpead?) Yes , take and make it up like you gonIa make biscuits and put it on a griddle and sit it up to a fire - in front of a fireplace and let it bake. And he draw her pitchure as near as he could , or the image of her, you know , and taken it back in de woods and shot it - cut up silver money and put in there instead of the shots in de shell and shot it. And they said that she was just about a quarter of a mile from home and on a p lain straight road, smooth road - no roots, not anything -and wh en he shot t hat pitchure just through de hip , she fell . Her leg broke - her hip . And so de people went and found her -she hollered and the people came. And she said she had stumped her foot over a root and there wasn't any root there, and they said she had a broken hip . And so her daughter wouldn't let anyone shroud her when she died.

So ah told him [about the witch or hag bothering his mother]. And he told me - it 's about a piece of beef , says , \"We goin ' tuh kill beef tomorrow,\" say, \"when you buy a piece of beef, be sure and have a piece of silver money to pay for it - you fetch it but I give it back to you . \" He says , [When] \"y ou buy this piece of beef,\" says , \"don't carry any pan or nothing out there for tuh bring in de house then , but let the blood drop from that beef right on straight on through the house, from beginning right on in the kitchen,\" say , \"and you won't be bothered anymore ,\" and he says, \"t hey might come bu t they cain I t come in .\" (Was he a white man or a colored man?)

They had one of those walkways [breezeway or dogtrot] between the house, and she hung it up there. And see, there was so much blood on it until it just ran up there, you know , against the side of de door - you know, like you have a nail for to hang a pan or somepin beside de door. So, that was a Saturday evening [afternoon] round about two o'clock. So, I hung de beef up in de kitchen. He tole me to put just a piece of paper or somepin lak that what I could throw right on away, under it fer to ketch the drops. And that Saturday night 'tween nine and ten o'clock my mother lied do wn. So then , brother and I, and my niece what stayed there with us - we sits round dere. There wasn't but three of us dere to home - and my sister's child stayed with us . And so we wasn't more than in the bed good before my mother called me and she says, \"There's [they are] right ro und de house.\" And I got out and looked and I didn't see anything at all. She says , \"Is there [they are there].\" And we had some geese and they was just de same as a dog in de yard when there was anything out there, and they was just running round and keeping a noise, just lak whenever a dog would get dere in de yard, or some person -just a-honking and keeping a lots of noise, and it seems like I had de funniest feeling to de shoes. And she says, \"It was right there in that window.\" It was in the summertime and we had the screen in the window, wire tacked in. We didn't use drawed [sliding] screens - used de wire nailed in - and de curtain were up, a nd see there was a moon shining just as pretty and bright as day . And she said they were standing right dere in dat window , \"Cause ah seed 'em,\" says, \"and I wouldn't tell you that there was somebody there, 'cause I was afraid you would get fri ghtened and I know you would take the gun and shoot,\" she says , \"and then that would tear my nerves all to pieces. \" \"Well,\" ah says , \"mother, ah does feel funny.\" She says , \"Well, when you went out in de other room, dey come back,\" she says , \"you go back in the other room and see will dey co me back.\" Ab says , \"Well, if dey do, you kin'ly knock on de house or somepin.\" And she says, \"Ab clear up mah throat.\" So I went on back d en in de livingroom and went on through in de shedroom , and she said, \"Here dey is,\" and I went back and looked and ah couldn't see anything . My brother and I we took de gun and shot and ah thought my mother would die. And I've been shoot in , dat gun ever since I guess I was round about ten year old , and had never had it kick before.

And so she went to a doctor and found out that some­body had put somepin down for her. It somepin wrahpped up in a little bondle and they had it over the door. It was some kinda powder and some COMPASS sharp instruments in there, look kinda like pins - it didn't have heads on it but it jis' was straight sharp. It was a rootman find it. He took a little somepin like a watch and laid a fifty cents on that, and anywhere they got anything down, it was a little hand turned [either a compass or buried-treasure finder], and that little hand turned toward that door and he went and got it. He took that [cunjuring object] - I don't know what he did wit it . He gave her some sweet milk and sheep bur [round droppings -dung] a nd sul­phur mixed together.

Well, she seemed to have been my best friend before she knowin' dat my husband was goin' tuh marry me. At de time we was gettin' ready CRYSTAL BALL to get married she attempted, no doubt, to separate us. And she got very special pieces and cut 'em into pieces. Well, I found 'em after goin' to see dis man. (Well, tell me about going to see that man again.) I went to see de man and he says to me , he says, \"Dis woman is your worst enemy.\" Said, \"Dis woman me ans to separate you and your husband.\" (And he was looking into a crystal or something like that wasn't he? ) [She is retelling the beginning of the story because I had failed to start machine.] Yes - you want me to tell dat again? (Yes. ) He said, \"Well, I will show you dis woman as your enemy, and I wants to see whether you mow her.\" The crystal was as big as a - great big round crystal and just as clear as a crystal - that's why I thought it was a crystal - must have been a crystal ball. (You actually could see her in there with her arms spread out?) I seen her spreaded and when he put de crystal, he said, \"�, look in here -it tells you.\" I says , \"All right.\" Dis woman was standing between me and my husband like this. He sayt \"Nowt dat's to keep you apart.\" (Well, how did it happen that you went to see this man?) I went home. I had something it effected [affected] me like the rheumatism -that what she had done it effected me just like a rheumatism. I had on my knees something de shape of a egg, dat you would bury you finger in - you know, it would give. (Was it a bump - a big bump?) [I am trying to prevent her from omitting details previously told. 1 Yes , it was right in this place and it just like you would bury a egg in sand; you know how de egg is an oval - something like dat and it would be half buried -and if you stick your finger in it in de morning it wouldn't come up through de day.

Then I begin to know it wasn't rheumatism, when he told me about de woman. So, w ell, I said , \"I don't believe what you say.\" He say, \"Certainly, you don't believe it but I want to show you .\" And when I seen de woman I believe there was something that wasn't so. So, she was just between us -she trembled just like a leaf -just like that [demonstrates ] • [How he agitated the concealed photograph depends upon whether the crystal was in his hands or on a permanent base. More important than the how is the clever­ness of the why. ] I says to him , I says, \"Well , why is that [tremb ling]?\" He says, \"She is very nervous - I 'm sending it, turning it back to her.\" He said , \"Now, when you go into your home\" - I were leaving in a day or so - \"you go to walk.\" I had to be carried upstairs and brought down . He say, \"You go to walk and when you go in , you just say , \"Take it off of me and put it on her.\" (You say that as you went in the door?) I was to say that as I go up de steps , and he give me something to sprinkle as I passed -\"Take it off of me and put it on Julia\" - her name was Julia -\"take it off me and put it on Julia.\" [He said] \"In a few days J ulia will become just like she wanted you to become . \" (How many times did you have to say that?) Right as I was goin ' up de steps . (Was there any number of times you had to say it?) Right on as I goin ' up the stairs - till I landed upstairs . I lived over her . And in a few days , he said, she'll become just like she intend me to become , and that was that she 'd be sore -all of her private p arts would be very , very sore and she 'd be so - just effected nobody w anted to have her round. Well, she did . And he said that she' ll ask you to wash for her . He said, \"Don 't fail to do it.\" Well , dat scared me to death and I wanted to get - you see he said , \"Oat's your only savior -that 's your only savior. \" So I went downstairs that morning -she asked me - and she was in a bad condition , and \"Don 't let dis woman get to your back.\" Well, it would be every five minutes she could be in dere , and I had to get up, you know, and turn my face to her, and I washed de clothes and I hung dem out. And when I get to my landing up de stairs again , he says , say de same thing, \"Take it off of me and put it on Julia .\" Well, dat woman was taken down so nobody - her husband left her and nobody stayed in dere, all de lodgers left. She was just so offensive - de house and everything . And she stayed that­a-way, I reckon, about th ree months in de house all alone, nobody paying no attention. And she died all alone. And they found dis package d at belonged to me where she had - and - because I knew de things -and some of my dress and it was something -I said it was red pepper and dis man said it was . And he said that these things were put together to separate us through living very much like two cats or dogs, see, and the y'd make me fight. [See No. 78 in which a woman becomes a drunkard because another woman put a spell on her.] Well , while he were treating me, he put me in dis bath and over here he had a table dat he mixed up all kinds of stuff - he had that table full of everything . So this solution that he give me to keep up de bath was something like bluestone, and he had bluestone - as I think it was , and - I was looking right at him - and he had sulphur and he had some kind of a white stuff looking just like salts , I I guess.

Yes, and I was to drop that, which -he said it was two drops or something -looked like blood. (After it was all mixed up it looked like blood?) Yeah - no , he just put three drops in dere - very much like blood. (Oh , he put three drops of [something looking like] blood in there?) Yes, and he told me to take this and bathe that leg down with mah feet settin' propped squa re and flat in de ba sin or in a tub , any place that I would get, and I was to pray and ask de Lord to uproot that. Sure enough I did - in ab out four days I was ready to run upstairs, and that place gone. (Was it on the side of your knee or just above your knee?)

Well, after she died , why I got on splendid and my health improved and every­thing seemed to be going on nicely , and this husband and I got back friendly again, and we live together now.

Yes, de doatop was in Petersburg. (What was his name - is he sti ll alive up there? ) Now? I don't think he is, because I tried to look for him for another friend and I don't believe dat he is alive.

But nobody over there kin tell anything about him no more than he were there, and nobody in Petersburg kin tell no more ten he was there - lived over in Pocahontas in two huts - there were dirt floors and roughly fixed as a b ed -you might say a bunk -that 's the way he stayed.

And while he worked in New Jersey , it was an old colored family and the old man was sick , and someone told him ab out this man that came from Virginia who"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -187 was supposed to be a cunjure. And this [supposedJ cunju� didn't like to work hard and he thought he would make some easy money. So he went to the home of this old family and had a talk with the old man, and he was convinced that he also believed in cunjuration. And after he talked with them awhile, he said he could cure the old man. The old man was sick. After he found out they believed in hfm, he went to work and he said he could cure him for fifty dollars and put the spell back on the woman who put it on him. So he went away that night and came back another dark night. Being very late at night, he planted a bottle under the doorsill containing button hooks [hooks and eyes] and needles and pins, and he had a coloring, some liquid in a bottle.

And said, \"Move again.\" The gourd moved off the fireplace between the old man's legs that was sick. He was setting in a chair. And he says, \"Mister, I told my wife I was cunjuped. Now I know it and you know it.\" So he told the cunjure the money was ready whenever he would cure him. So the aunjure said it would take about three weeks, because the person that put the spell on him was a far off. So the aunjupe went home that night knowing that he had some easy money coming. He went in t he woods the next day and got some pokeberry roots and red oak bark and saxafras [sassafras] roots and cooked it together and made a tea, which is got for rheumatism, [I] don't care how [long] standing, because his father cured himself with the very same remedy. So he came back three days later to the old man's home and brought a pint of this tea that he had made, and told him to take a tablespoonful three times a day before each meal, which he did. And inside of one week he was feeling much better. And the following Sunday this aunjupe came back to see how the old man was. And the old man said, \"Boy, I'm feeling fine. Come over one night next week and I will give you half of the money. \" The cunjupe didn't wait a week. He came back the third day with another pint and told him to double the dose, which the old man did. And at the end of the second week the old man's rheumatism was gone. And instead of giving him twenty-five dollars he gave him fifty and just spread his name abroad. And the cunjure still lives today and said he made over three-hundred dollars just for this good remedy which his father cured himself.

I remember when the town [Hampton, Virginia] first went dry and they didn't allow any bootlegging, so they said, and two or three people got caught with their whiskey and a stiff fine was put upon them. So thereafter there came HOG BLADDER? a man from Newport News [Virginia] to Hampton, going from one place to another, saying he could prevent the law from coming to my house and that I could go and sell all the whiskey I wanted to and the law could not bother me. So I to ok it in my charge that I would try him. I had taken in my house fifty gallons of liquor and I began to distribute it �rom one place to the other. Sometimes I would look out and see the law coming and was wondering whether or not they were coming to my house. I can say with a clear conscience that the day I saw the man and paid him one hundred and fifty-three dollars and fifty-three cents for this instrument, and I can say and witness the fact, that the law has never been to my house since that occasion. He gave me an instrument and told me to hang it by my stove and leave it stay there, and whensoever I saw the law coming, to take it down and put it on the table and the law would turn around and go back. It �in'a resembled a hog bladder or something of that sort. When the law was coming in your direction, this instrument would pu ff out, and you could always look out your casement and see the law; and then you would take it down and put it on the table, and the law would turn around and go back.

Her sister, who was almost white, she believed in hoodooing; but Rebecca was a brown-skin girl and she didn't believe in it.

So when she came home, she was working for some very wealthy white people, she got so then she couldn ' t hardly walk. And she said she felt like there was a mouse crawling on her leg. She had to go down to get sugar and things to th is little town and she rode down . And when she came back home she had a big black blister on her foot. She hadn't walked nowhere.

Her sister said, \"Oh l Well, they got you but didn't get me .\" So the young man , who went to see Rebecca, asked his mother for a wagon and his nephew to drive her to a woman's house what could do something for you. I guess she was what you call a two-header. It was about twenty miles. When she came in the door she [the two-header] took a bottle like that and shake it. Rebecca hollered and said , \"Oh l Oh ! Don' t you do that any more.\" She did that to try to see what was wrong with her. She come on in and set down . She [the two-header] called all the people [their spirits] to her that were doing something to her. She said, \"Now Rebecca you are going home , and the bright woman [the innocent one] is going to go away and isn't going to speak to you; the one that did it is going to whip you, if you let her. \" [Since the spirit of the innocent woman called before the two-header possessed a bright countenance, we must assume a dark one for the spirit of the culprit -see No. 627 .] So Rebecca came back and stop in front of this store and de young boy [nephew ] went in to get some things. I heard such a fuss outside, myself, I goes out to see what is happening. This girl that done something to Rebecca , she lived just across the road, says to her, \"There comes your partner [the young man returning from the store] . Yes , you're cunjured. And God Almighty cunjured you . If I get close enough to you, I 'll take you out of that wagon and give you a good wooping [whipping].\" But she didn't touch her . And Rebecca went on up home and done what the woman told her to do. She told her how to use [the medicine] what she give her. That would do away with that causing her leg .

The difficulty of indexing hoodoo material makes every title or label incomplete. Always the Index must be consulted.] [The preceding subsection, Diagnosis, showed doctop and layman seeking in­formation in primitive ways discarded by modern thought; ways still under the control of the spirits whose activities previously we had been following. One of these ways told us \"whether to go to a doctor - a medical doc top either (or) a poot doctop (see No . 551, p.167).\" This reference, not to mention others, indicates a basic difference between medical doctop (D octor of Medicine) and poot doatop; it also im plies a limitation in the therapeutics of scientific medicine. Let us begin with the doctor.] 641. You getting a medical doctop, a medical doctop and you say [for example] I'm sick - I feel bad and I'm hurting and hurting or something. You get a doctor and the doctor will come. He 'll come maybe once or twice DOCTOR OF MEDICINE and he'll tell you, after his medicine don't take no 'fect , tell you, say , \"You have to get somebody else know more than I know.\" Then you got'a wander around and first thing you goin' find your mind on hoodoo, and you goin' get a hoodoo den. Well, a hoodoo, den he goin ' come and tell you, \"Yeah , there's something done to you.\" You say , \"Well , I want you to git it off. How much you charge me?\" \"Well, I charge four or five or ten dollars.\" Well, y ou goin' give him four , five or ten dollars and he goin' get it off. Well, he's the same one what put it on you .

(Where did she put this perfume? On what part of the body?) Put it under his arms . (What else did that woman do to get rid of this, besides rubbing -did she do anything else?) She give her a bottle of medicine to take . [Mobi le, Ala. , (660) , 862:1. ] 649. She was goin' with a woman's husband. She asked her to give him up, but she wouldn't do it. She talked to her three times and told h er. She wouldn't, you know. And she says, \"I'll make you leave.\" This woman told us after she [woman going with husband] was dead. She [wife] said she taken a penny and taken the skin off of a red onion. She rubbed it all together. You know a penny is poison. And she put that penny up and she let it dry right dry and make a powder of it. She dressed her husband with it - dusted his clot hes. And when he went back [to the other woman] - see, it got on her. And it turnt her jis, as wrong side out. No doctor couldn't git it back. It turnt her wrong side outwards. She died. Jis' turnt her whole womb and everything . It came out.

He was dressed for his wife; the dressing no matter how poisonous, being harmless to him (cf. No. 10 , p.7). Intention is almost everything in hoodoo and magic. A good example follows:] I was living in a street here in Norfolk, and the undertaker - you know I'm a jackleg carpenter - the undertaker told me to put a pair of steps to his door, and I had to dig down fer 'em. I come across a IT WARN 'T PUT THERE FOR YOU Eye-sh [ Irish] p otato that had nine needles in it and nine pins.

Right at the door was a snake-shed [the whole skin shed by a snake]. It was filled with sand . My mother was looking out the door. I thought it was a snake.

If you touched it, it would be all right - it wouldn't hurt you. Mother thought it was for her . That 's why she made me get it on that paper. You see, some woman was mad at her. She [other woman] said, \"Never mind, I'll aross your path soon.\" I have heard them say that a lot of times . [This is called a bad mouth. ] Then they put some­thing down for you to walk over. She was afraid I would drop it, \"Don't you let that fa111\" Then she said we would go to the bridge. She wouldn't let me -go by myself. She and I went together. She did not cross it, the place where that snake was , but went way around. She wouldn't walk behind me . She walked a way on the other side of the road. When we were halfway there [to the bridge] she said, \"It came from the devil, let it go back to him.\" She made me go right out on the middle of the bridge, right in the middle of the channel, and throw that snake-shed right in the water. When she came back she bought a pound of salt and sprinkled that salt allover the place [where the snake-shed had been found] , to kill the germs I guess.

But there' s people visits the cemetery all the time and nobody pays no mind, so -but these women was not presentable to be at the funeral, or out there expecting the funeral or anything , they was slack and slouchy .

And then the woman said, \"Why does my blood move in this particular place and does not move anywhere else?\" So she bathed it, rubbed it. And they did everything they knew. Finally , it got so large that you could see the shape of it just ab ove her ankle. They began to bind certain chemicals to her leg which seemed to weaken the movement of whatever it was .

My husband rented a house in Staunton , Virginia, and went to Pittsburg to make money to buy a home . While he was in Pittsburg, this man he rented the house from , I used to go around with his wife and I was very nice to her. I used to give her lunch every Sunday night when we came from church . My husband had written to me to ask Mr . Dodd to look after the hogs being butchered. Of course I told Mrs. Dodd about it and she told me , \"Don't bother Mr . Dodd. Mr .

It's in a bottle and I found it and took it and put it over in the orchard. And don' t you eat nothing she brings you.\" They had an old-home week there. They decorate the wagons and show what they have to sell. Her and I went down to see the parade, me and the young girl. So she says to me , \"There's that bottle\" - when we was coming back.

I would take all kinds of 'erbs and medicines from him and start to rubbing myself with them but that don't do no good. Well, I'll say I 'll try another hoodoo. You see .

He said , \"I'm going to put this bottle under your mattress and then you throw it back and that bug going to get out of that mattress into that bottle.\" All right. She did that. Now, in place of him putting the bottle without any bug in, he slipped the one with the bug in it, you see . And when she turn back, he said, I INow go back and turn the mattress - look.\" And when we turn the mattress there was the bottle with the big bug in it. I say, \"OHI\" And my friend say, \"Oh , look there, that bug was in your bed , too.\" I told her, I said, \"Oh , don't mind that , tain't no bug in no bed or nothing like that . \" I watched him so close and he was watching me very close, you know, wh en he was doing that.

I had to lay with my head across my bed - not straight up and down like that - had to lay across -over the bed with my head down like that.

See, our National Insurance Company furnished me two physicians -Dr . Sanderson from Knox Hospital , special doctor, and Dr . Hartel from the First National Bank come out and treated me. They didn't do me no good - the medicine turned against me. I paid a dollar a dozen for some capsules from Dr. Podesky - yes, sir, a dollar a dozen . I'd taken up twenty-five dozen of them capsules. They got to the place that they didn't do me good in all that misery - a knot formed on my head about that long [demonstrates] . (Right at the back of your head?) Yes, sir. He said that he would lance it, but which I don't know whether he lanced it or not. But I tell you what that knot would do. When I go down to Dr. Podesky and get in his office, just in a twinkling when I open that door like that, that knot would go off of my head, and when I'd leave out of that office and stepped across [the door] , that knot would come back up there.

He claimed his brother could do mostly anything he wanted to do and most he learnt it was from whut his brother learnt 'im. His brother wanbed POWER FROM him to preserve his skull and keep it with him fer action. And BROTHER'S SKULL whenever he went in to do anything he worked up to a power from this skull. He dealt with this skull, he talked to it, he sang to it, he danced to it , and it seemly he gits his power and he goes right on. Now , he would go to work, he had five lamps, he placed one in the center of each hand, he placed one on each shoulder and one on his head , and buck danced. He - I mean danced - he wasn't trying to dance , he danced I And danced jist as ab out as fast as any that choo would find in any theatre. Then he was ab le to go right on and do anything or say anything that he would want to say to anyone. He could tell you anything mostly you wanted to know.

So it seemly as though he had did it once in his life, but said he didn't want to travel that way any more. And he had a lamp that he kept in his room that he only had to light it or replenish it onest every six months. And he said when that lamp should go out he' ll have to go out , he can't stay in that room . [I think the informant missed the point here. This is probably an example of a person's life depending upon the condition of some material object - so common in folktales.] And he came to me one day here to my work [in the hotel] and says to me, he was visiting [boarding with] me , and he says , \"Is there any place you kin take me out of town?

So he said to me and another one of my boy friends - we were always walkin' down this town here - that he could fix us so that we could git all the money or anything else that we wanted , but we 'd have to go with him at nighttime. Well, we decided to do it. So he told us to git shovels . So we got shovels . An ' I 'm not knowin' what he could do - of course, I'm skeered of those sort of things. An' we went around to his place about eight o'clock at night and he entertained us by playin' the guitar and the banj o , and singin ' and dancin' , till along about eleven o'clock we thought somepin ought to take place then, becuz it wus time for us to go home and go to bed.

This cemetery wus about a half a mile out of this present town on this Deals Island road . And he said after a body laid in the grave so many days - I think he said ten days - that there would be a slobber that would come from the mouth. And we had to git into this grave , that he would git this slobber. And he said twelve o'clock . Well, I wus through with 'im right then as soon as he said twelve o'clock. But he never told us whut we had to do until this particular night. And he would get this slobber. Our work would be to open the grave, and he'd go in it and git this off of this body ; we 'd cover it up and come on back. Then he'd build these things the next day . But he had to have that. Now I've heard speak of he had to have graveyard dust out of a coffin, but he never told us whut he could do with it or anything. But he did specialize in the slobber that would develop from a man's mouth or anyone that' s been dead ten days.

I kin explain something that happened to me once in life , see. We ll , see , I married, and I married - the husband I married , he was much older than I I WOULD OF DIED IF I HADN'T OF COME TO HIM NO QUICKER wa s . I was only fourteen years of age and he was living with a lady at the time. Wel l, he left her to marry me. Well, in the meantime, she didn't care for me to marry him. Well, I married him anyway and course - we lived together, twas about seven months. And afterwards we commence to having disputes and I didn't know what it was all about. So one day as I was hanging up de clothes, I found in his pocket a little bag."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"312 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -It was sewed in the bottom of one of his coat pockets. So I'd taken the bag out and opened it and it was lotta dust or something like that - pepper and salt mixed up and different stuff. Well , I didn't re ' lly know what it was . Well, I opened this bag and I smelled it and I took on a fainting headache. Well, after that I w as taken sick and with the headache. I never could get rid of it. l went to several medicaZ dOctors and I never could get rid of it. Well, I went to this doctor down here on Washington Street, named Doctor Spencer - he supposed to be a root doctor. Well, after I went to him , he put me up on the table and he examined me and he told me that I was sick. Well, ah wanted to know then what it was, and he told �, say , \"Well, now , I'll be out to see you tomorrow .\" I was living on Adams Street. Well , wh en I'd gotten back home - well, my husband, he had left, but I didn't know wh at was de trouble. And so, then I went on to the place where he was stopping at and they told me tha t he had moved his clothes and everything ; but he was not there, but he and the woman was together at another place. Well, then Doator Spencer came out to me the next day , and he told me that he wanted to investigate round my house but he didn't wanta do it until night and he would show me something . That night he came back and he found a litt le bottle . [We] had a walk - we walked from the street to my house. Well, it was a bottle sitting up with a stopper in it. Some stuff was in it -the small bottle was sticking out and the big bottle was sticking in . And he said, \"This stopper - as long as this big bottle is sticking in, you see, you would [will] never get rid of your headache.\" Hit was something in the bottle - kind of yellowish looking and he poured it out . It just, you know, just circle like . It didn ' t never look like water or anything - seemed more like it was oil than anything else. Well, he told me that that was causing my headache and when that stopper would have blew out , he said I would of died , if I hadn't of come to him no quicker. Well, he tole me that he would charge $25 for that and I would pay him. The next day I had a notice in my door for to meet court. My husband was putting in for divorce. I had a notice in to meet court. I went on to the [something ] clerk and he told me if I wanted to file a suit against him, to sue him for alimony, that I could do it. Well, I didn't know how to go up against him - being young . Well , I went on out dere - it was a lady, they told me that could read cards and tell me things. And she charged me a dollar to do that. She told me that if I would enter a suit against him I could beat him in court, providin ' if she would help me. Well, I asked how much would it cost to do that and she told me and she sent me to her lawyer - Lawyer Smith . (What did she charge you?) This woman, she didn't charge me but a dollar . But the lawyer he charged $50 but he got it from him [the husband] . It was during the time before the bonus was paid in 1931. Well, after de bonus was paid, then -before de bonus was paid we had our lawsuit at the courthouse. Well, this lady she was there , the lawyer , and he [the husband] was there. Well, ah beat him in de case. Well, after I beat him in de case - it was three or four days afterwards, t his money came from de government. Well, s he told me to go ahead on and take $50 - that was de best I could do out of it, and he paid my lawyer and his lawyer $50 which is $100. Well, then we stayed on separated and later he was shed of de woman that he was living with at the time . She came to my house one day and she brought a little cake for my baby - know, we had a child. And so I just broke [a piece] off de cake to taste it.

And after tasting the cake I wasn't nearly anything else but under a letagy[? lethargy?]. Then they called de doctor again . Well, then he come and he bathed me off, and it was somethin' runnin' through my body, just like it was crickets or somethin' - you know, it was just like somethin' was crawlin' in me but you never could tell what it was. (How did he bathe you - any special way?) [I wanted to know whether it was the m agic rite of downwards.] No sir, he just took me and put some water in a basin and just stripped me off and just took that wet towel and just, y ou know, wrung it kinda dry and wiped me down. Well, I could feel -I could see - he told me. [He told me shows the oriokets were n ot crawling about in her until after his suggestion.] (He wiped you down - he didn't wipe you up?) [Again, I sought the magic rite of downwards .] No, sir, he just wiped it down - he say, so hit - so it would cover my body -says it was coming up , and it was also dangerous . (Was this Dootor Spencer that did this?) This same Dootor Spencer. He supposed to be a root dootor. And so, after then, I commenced to feeling pretty good, but hit would sorta run up this laig and would go down. (Go down the same leg?) Come up one and go down the other one - it crossed the body like th at. Well, he dootored on me that way for about six or seven months . I was - I had passed walking at one time - I had lost my nerve - had run down so I just couldn 't - and from worrying over my condition 1 just couldn' t do anything. Well, that happened after the lawsuit was , and I beat him in the case and got this money out of him. Well, I had to pay the biggest of that out to the dootor. Well, I'd gotten better, then I went on to work again down to the cafe. I went to work at the cafe then and I heard about a lady in the same fix I was in , and I sent her to Dootor Spencer. She was telling me about that she had frogs -the shape of frogs would pop up in her skin. And so she said that he cured her. And so I sent several people to him since then. But that my own - I've been in that shape myself. And then I knows lots of others that reIlly have been trioked like that - in hoodooism like that. (You finally got well, didn't you?) Yes , I got well. Ah fin'lly got well and me and my husband stayed separated then nine years and seven months and then we went back together, and we living -fin'lly I got well and I don't have any trouble whatever now. (Are you still living together?) Still living with my same husband. (Well, what did you do -have to get married again?) No, sir. Ah divorced him to a clean sweep - see , they put the divorce in, but after we couldn't get the divorce. . through - he was suing me all the same to try to take the child from me - and so they didn't let the divorce go all the way through. Then , we never did get it through, so we just went back together . (I se e.) [Vicksburg, Miss ., (716) ,984:3.] 876. The story's if you git a spider in whiskey .

[As the preceding examples indicate, the first part of a hoodoo consul­tation concerns time : either You aame to me just in time or You aame too late -depending upon whether the doator thought his cure would succeed or fail. We now come to the second part of the consultation, which is always something like : You 're on your tUay to the graveyard! ] He lived over on the same farm that I was raised on - I left there when I was four years old -and he claimed that he was one of thes e high fe llahs [usually high man = root doator or cunjureman on the East ern Shore]. So he got his name MAN YOU'RE RUINED out here as being one of those high fe llahs . So he fix ed the path between his house and our path , our house rather, and fixed this path up like he wanted it. In fact, he got himself a spool and he made some holes in this spool just ab out the size of a needle point. He takes these needles and he puts 'em down in here. And he goes and gits himself some mura tic [muriatic] acid [commerical name for hy drochloric acid] . He bores [ small holes] in the bottom of this bottle and lets the points of these needles go through this spool just where they could touch this acid. Well, the needle would stick up just above de earth where these barefooted folks walked. [\"The heads of the needles touched the acid and the points stuck up above the ground\" - my note made at the time of my transcription, a few days after story collected. ] And then , naturally , when a man come along and stepped on one of these spools with his bare foot, you know what· took place, with that muratic acid through that"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -315 needle in his flesh.

Now, they had to send for him. [No high man , even a stupid one , would have used such a crude triak as exposed needles in a path. This piece of gossip is merely one of many versions of the buried-needle theme - a pain or swelling in foot or leg comes from walking over a buried needle. However , a person does not step on an exposed needle point; contact between needle and flesh is magical. Originally the buried needle was a buried poot (see No . 718, p.239) . The aut hor or editor of our story has heard of hyp odermic needle but he does not know that it is hollow. How he thought acid could flow through a solid needle I am unable to say.] He'd come around and tell 'em, \"There's first, one thing buried here around this post.\" Said, \"I don't wonder tha t chew being swelled up - no , I don't.\" He says, \"Man , you got somepin awful around your house here. I kin move it. I know right where it is and I kin take it away from here. it Well , naturally , you want that thing taken away. You all swelled up there and didn't know what de trouble was. He'd go to work and he'd come there, and he'd git a bottle of hair, needles and pins , first one thing and then another, and bring it in the house , open this bottle , and there you'd find all this stuff. He said, \"M.an, you 're ruined, you ruined for life. You've got to be worked on and worked on quick.\" And he just gone there and took those few needles up in the earth there, see [those he was supposed to have buried ], and he'd know just what to do , you know, to cut that acid from hurtin ' yeh or burnin' yeh to death. And you'd pay him your money. And the first thing , you know, he'd go in the pound [cattle enclosure] and git a ole dump lin , of cow dung, you know, and fix it up . And go out and git hisself a few leaves of ole field mullein and elder roots, and boil all of that stuff up together . Then he'd put that on a fire and boil it up , and put some rock salt in there and a little table salt, fix it up , in a few minutes have your feet in there up to your knees . And you sit there now until he tell yeh to get up in a certain length of time. [Princess Anne, Md., (?) , 38 :2.] 879. I went to a lady and I was apossed. I used to be very lucky and I got apossed.

(Yes, go ahead.) In the little town where I was born, you know there w as a lotta people there that believed in hoodooism. (I see -and will you talk slow, please.) THE DOCTOR There were a lotta people and they believe in hoodooism. KNEW WHAT SHE CAME FOR There was a man, he was - before he married - he was court in , another lady, and after he married why he still �eethearted with her. And he moved next door to her when he married. And he took care of his wife and bought her everything that she needed as far as he was able , and his sweetheart envied her , envied his wife because he neglected her mostly altogether. And she tried a certain some way of getting rid of his wife, and she - she sought around, she found out that it was a man in another county that she could go to him and have this lady fixed to get rid of her. And she went - she caught the train one eve ning and went to this man. It was a man. She went to the man and when the man saw her coming. he told her to come in - he kD;; what her business was there. (Where did this man live that she went to see? What town did he live in , or near what town?) He lived in New Orleans. (And where was this town that you were born in?) Taylor . (Where?) Ta ylor . (Where is that?) It's in Mississippi. (Taylor - how do you spell it?) Cary. (All right - go ahead.) And after she went there, he told her what she - he knew what she came for. And so she explained everything to him. So he gave her a little bottle about fo ' inches tall with some kind of a liquid in it -it was a little green bottle with some kind of liquid in it. And he told her , like if - when she come back to bury it under her (wife's] steps . And she came back with it one dark night and took and buried it under the steps. And the next day the lady came out, you see, to go to the store to [buy] some­thing for breakfast. And when she came out, she came down the steps, and as she came down the steps , why something caught her - a pain caught her in the leg and drew her legs up and she couldn 't walk. A man came along and he called another lady and he helped put her in the bed. And she was getting worse and worse, look like it would kill her aBd so her husband thought he would get, you know, consult diff'rent physicians and he couldn't never get any cure for her. So one day , he was long and sad, looking for someone and he met a man, and !h! man told him that he knew his troubles, and then asked him how long his wife had"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"318 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -been sick. And he said about two months. And so he said he could cure his wife. So the man went on back to his house and told him - when he got to the steps he told him to bring him a spade. He brought him a spade and he dug up that little gree n bottle. The man what he met was a hoodoo himself, and he dug up the bottle and carried it to some running water and threw the - opened the bottle and threw the liQuid into the stream, and threw the bottle into the stream, too, both of then, and didn' t even look back and went on back to the house and he asked the lady how did she feel , and she sairl she was feeling better all at once. And so he made up some kind of a mixture of herbs and rubbed her up with it - rubbed her with it, and fixed some stuff in a bottle and told her to put it under the pillow and let it stay under there for about three days. And then after he'd taken it from under her pillow, well, he'd taken and diggin' in the front yard . you know, puts it and buries it in the front yard in front of the gate - opposite the gate, and buried it deep enough so that no one could dig it up or nothing could dig it up .

She decided to go to the city [Washington, D.C.] to work. She made her home wi th some relatives. The girl, being very fair, through her personality she seemed to take this woman's husband from her entirely . After years and years of ORDERS DISOBEYED EXCUSE intimacy they had some family trouble . She tried to fix the girl so her husband would have no other care for her. Her husband had gotten so bold with her that he took her out to open places - off on long trips where he couldn't take his wife and children. After awhile this girl was taken down seriously ill. After a thorough examination the doctor decided that the girl should go to a tuberculosis sanitarium. Her mother of course had her sent there . After several weeks stay the doctors there finally couldn't do anything for her so she returned to her home. And after being put under her former doctor's care he give her up saying there was nothing he could do. The girl of course being very fair turned very dark during her sickness. When the doctor said he couldn 't do anything, her mother came under the conclusion that some form of cunjupation had been performed. She brought the girl to her former country home and had a cunjuPation doctor visit her, I don't know who she was , to work upon her. The doctor told her, �, she had been tricked, who had tricked her , and how it had been done. The woman [wife] had someone perform the act. She took some fluid from her [girl's] body -yes , her monthly fluid, put it in a bottle and put it in a corner of the closet in Washington. She tole her to take this bottle and throw it over in the river. She told her she should stay on this side over the river [the Potomac] and not go back to her city home and she would get well. The girl stayed home for several months. After getting well, as she thought, she decided there was nothing anyone on that end could do to her if she would be careful , so she returned back to the city . She one night was invited to this same home and she insisted upon drinking wine and eating cake. Well, on that night on returning home from the party she was taken desperately ill again. The doctor said it was the same thing as before . There was nothing for her to do but to go back to the country air. So her mother several days after that took her back home to the cunjuration doctor again. The doctor told her that she had disobeyed her orders. She said she had been tricked by these same people, taking wine, that she had a double dose in her system and she wasn't ab le to do anything for her. Several days after that the girl died very quickly . They buried her privately. Her mother knew and other friends knew. Because she turned so black they didn't want her to be seen.

And this woman's daughter and her [another woman's daughter] used to go to church together. It seems that this other woman didn't like this EVILDOER PRODUCED AT ONCE girl because her hair was so much better than her daughter ' s. So she fixed this child - she used to go and comb her hair. Finally , one evening this girl went off crazy . And then her mother asked this old man [who told the story to informant] did he know anybody that could do her any good. And he told her, \"Yes, I'll have to go five miles to get to this man's house.\" So he got a fast horse [and buggy] and he got away from there that night. And when they got to this man 's house the man told him, \"I know what you all came for. Sit down a minute. You all came here because the girl is crazy and you want me to do something for her .\" They told him , \"Yes.\" He said, \"You all go ahead and I will be there presently .\" So they went on and got to the girl's house. They weren't there more than two hours when he came in. So when he got in he spoke to them and said, \"Get me a basin full of hot water and a towel.\" And they got the basin and towel f or him. And he put the towel right down in the boiling water and wrung it out and put it right to her head . After he put this to her head she came to real life and knew where she was at. He must have put something in the water, but the old man didn't say. He stayed there until four o'clock next morning. Before he left the girl had come to and knew everybody in the house. And he told this man that went after him, \"Son, you know what I want you to do? Come on and go around the house with me .\" They went around the house. It was getting kind of light then. They carried a lantern . This girl's father ;as with them. They had a spade. When they got to the corner of the house he told him to dig right down. He dug . They found a little barrel. They dug it and picked it up and ga ve it to him. They took it into the house. He asked them did they want it and they said no they didn't want it. So when they opened it, the image of this girl was cut out of a piece of black cloth . It had needles and pins in there and a whole lot of stuff. He did not say what all was in there . This man said, \"You all don't want this?\" And they said, \"No.\" So he took it himself.

An' aftah she, yo' know, commence tellin' her mothah an ' lak dat , yo' know, well, den he commence tuh whippin ' her an' beatin' her yo ' know an ' all lak data She had long hair ab out that long [demonstrates] an ' when she got up tuh about fifteen yeahs ole, he taken a plait of her hair an ' put it in a cake-flavor bottle an ' he carried dis girl's hair to de Miss'ippi Rivah , an ' put it ovah-in--1iat Miss' ippi Rivah, an' dat ch ile fifteen yeahs ole , she started tuh walkin' . She left home that even in , an' her mothah didn't know where she wus, an' she walked - she walked aw ays. She walked back down heah to a place dey call Forest City, an' she got lost walkin' an ' so they wus in Cold Spring tryin' tub find her, an' dey did find her, an' dey carried her tuh a man named Mr. Smith. He's up heah tuh Turrell[?] Arkansas . Her mothah taken her tuh dis man , an ' he killed de hair in dis bottle, but how he kilt it ah dunno. But he kilt de hair in dis bottle, an ' t hat brought de girl back . (How long ago did that happen?) i Aw , it 's been 'bout nine yeahs ago .

Wells this cases she wus at some frien's - an' [she] a vury nice lookin' woman - an' they all got jealous of 'ere She had all the best fellahs - she had a beautiful head of hahr. An' one of fer frien's come roun' to brush fer hahr. An' in the meantime she [the friend] had took some of 'er hahrs an' all of fer hahr wus fallin' out. An' so she's got hahrnows but it's so short an' it nevah growed. An' she said her. friend wus the one that did this to 'ere Well nows she said she [the friend] cared it to some person [doctor] out dere in Dinwiddie County [Virginia] some place, an' said they takes this hahr an' put it with snake bones an' some kin'a 'erb they got, an' put it in a bottle an' let it float. An' as long as that bottle float, why yo' hahrs fallout; but if that bottle breaks, you die. Tha's whut she said. An' so, now, it's a way to quit this spell, as they say, by some kinta method they use. They git some of that other person [the friend who cast the spell] urinate an' care it to this other party. [The \"other party\" was a root doctor living at Richmond.] This party [Richmond root doctor] will put that to float. An' [also] he gits some of this other party's [the friend's] hahr an' put it in there with his [her] own [the friend's own] urniate. An' that'll float. They said dis [second] bottle will cause some kinta gas to form an' bus' de cork out of it. An' when that cork bus'es, when dat cork come outs why that will kill [remove the spell from] de other bottle. They claim that de other [first] bottle do burs', you gon'a dies because dis other fellah's [the friend's] urinate an' hahr - they claim that hahr turns to some kinta serpent in that bottle [see Hair, turning to snake in Index.] [This is complicated thought and action. What happened? A woman losing her hair thought a friend had tricked her. The Richmond doctor told her the friend had taken the hair to a Dinwiddie doctor who set it afloat in a b ottle with snake bones and a root. The Richmond man, faced with a difficult problem, came up with the logical remedy - f loat a stronger bottle in pursuit. Actually, the friend was innocent - also, neither Dinwiddie doctor nor first bottle existed. I also doubt the launching of the second bottle. One small point may be missed -the spirit of the dead snake was in the first bottle [see margin-title Snake, p.66 and Index]; in the second bottle was urine, destroyer of evilminded spirits. That Richmond doctor thinks magically; doctors brilliantly.] [Richmond, Va., (341), 281: 1. ] 923. Now mah wife, I an' her wus togethah heah year befo' last. We separated Christmas gone a year ago. Ab reckon we lived heah three mo nths ago. Now, she wus fi�ed, although she's impregnant -understand. Sometimes she would grow out DOCTOR COOPERATES WITH DOCTOR an' den sometimes she would go back in. Ah could lay mah han's on her stomach an' I could feel somepin knockin' lak dat - jes' knockin'. Well, ah tried doctors - de doctors stayin' in town heah now - Dr. Fields, Dr. Olson, Dr. Roach. She wus workin' 1n de Georgia Power an' Light Company.

Well, ah wus a man an' ah had no business doin' all those things fo' her. Some things I could do an' some things ah wouldn't do, although ah wus her husband. Well, dey would come ovah an' dey would do for her. So ah tole 'er one day, ah said, \"Say, listen, whut de doctor say?\" Ah say, \"Did yo' went to him?\" She say, \"Yes, ah went to him.\" She say, \"Dr. Fields sayan' also Dr. Walker say I was impregnant.

It was greasy - to keep de misery from comin' on .me , yo ' see.

An' dat Sunday, she got 'long jest as - nevah been sick no mo'. (Do you know what he did with those three pieces of cedar root that you took to him?) Ah don't know, suh. He wouldn't even tell me whut he did wit it. After ah'd taken her back dere wit me, he wouldn't even let me come in de room whilst she's in dere. When ah got de cedar tree root ah give it tuh her.

[The Doctor of Medicine who \"took de baby\" was not satisfied with the mother's looks.

Once upon a time there was a party going on and the boys of course was drinking as usual and a fight arose among them, a nd in the me antime they were fighting this woman's brother.

So of course DEAD DOCTOR TRIES that roused the curiosity [animosity] of the man's mother, so TO COMPLETE SPELL nuthin she thought on but to aunjupe this woman. So they met at an all day meeting [at church]. So just at the time of dinner [noon meal] this young man's mother fixed the sp ecial d inner for the woman who hit her son in time past. And of course she fixed a plate for this woman and asked her to eat at once before the crowd came. And she insisted several times, so many times that the woman suspected. And I looked in the plate which she was about to eat and the food it looked very peculiar - looked like corn bread and butter mashed together on the same plate with other food, cabbage and so forth. So she looked at it so hard until the woman said, \"There's nuthin to hupt you.\" This woman didn't eat it. And the woman who fixed [cunjured] the plate was taken sick the next Sunday and died shortly afterwards. She might of gotten the same plate by mi stake. The cunjupe from King George [County, Virginia] who was doing the work [cunjuration] for her [the mother], he also died shortly after the woman �. The day he was buried, the same night, he came to the woman's house for whom he had fixed the dose, and he appeared in his own form and look. He stood on the steps and leaned over the bannister and looked at this woman, and the dog howled and run under the house, there was a whirlwind, and fright�n the woman out of her wits. And the woman didn't even know he was dead until the next day. He come because he didn't get the dose on the woman and he wanted to get in there-­and complete the job.

(What do you mean by that? I couldn't quite understand you.) [To make her"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -345 speak louder and repeat.] Well, ah couldn't sleep at night you know, and when ah'd see de daylight come you know, ah'd git scared, ah wouldn't know it was day. Ah hadn't been sleepin', ah hadn't closed mah eyes. And it would be day, but de minute that ah realize that it was day ah'd falloff into a deep sleep, and I would sleep from daylight until eight 'clock in de morning, but when ah'd wake up ah'd jest be fulla aches and pains, so much so that ah couldn't git up, so ah layed in bed till about ten 'clock and then at ten 'clock ah'd git up and git mah breakfast, and the minute ah'd git mah breakfast ah'd falloff tuh sleep agin. Well, it jest continue that way till finally I jest give up to day-sleepin'. An' ah'd feel tuh mahself - ah feel jest like a snake do or something like that or frog or something other, but yet ah couldn't get mahself togethah. Natchurly ah couldn't work.

And when ah layed down to sleep, somepin would jest go 'cross mah face like this [demonstrates] and ah'd jump and wake u p, you know, and look under the pillahs. There would be nothing, ah could see nothin' you know. And sometimes ah would feel like feathers was sticking intuh me - like de quills. Ab's take and pull dis cover off and there would be nothin', absolutely nothin' - could see nothin'. And so this continued tull finally ah became a wreck, and den dey said it was bad nerves and ah goes de hospital. De doctor pronounced it neuritis, ar-ritis, flamita ry rheumatism, chronical rheumatism, muscular rheumatis, tubercular rheumatism a nd bone fever. Well, so then they stuck needles in mah arms - all in de shoulders, you know, and they would hurt me tuh mah heart. And ah says, \"THESE THINGS BEAT LIKE -SOMEPIN LIKE HEARTS ALL OVER ME.\" Ab had a pocket right chere [demonstrates] -it's a little bit there now - jest like some thin , in there would beat, beat. (There was a pocket on your right side?) Yes. (Right about the waist.) Jest like there was s ometh in , live in there. Well, ah takes sick at night and ah vomits turrible. It near kill me - green, pale, an' it near kill me. And ah jest kept up this thing and kept up this thing until finally one of the doctors says to me, says - t hese needles was hurtin' me so bad ah cried. They said, \"Do those needles hurt chew like that?\" Ab said, \"Yes.\" Well the doctors said don't give her nuthin tuh rub and don't give her nuthin tuh gargle with. One little doctor was West Indian [a Negro] - dis was at de Freedman's Hospital. (Here in Washington?)

And so, that night somepin got up heah and jest choked me turrible and I was so sleepy - ah gqt it out and put it on a piece of paper, and started off asleep and de second one came up. Well, it jest like to me ah was in daze condition, and den ah woke up like dat and ah felt pur tty good and ah remembered dis, and ah went looked at it and it was black - it was large enough to choke me. And the other one was smaller. So when ah told de doctors about it, den they commence to jab in here - like to choke me all through de body. Dey [had] to quit, but however - then, I says,"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"346 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -\"Ah'm goin' take now - go to church fo' this and ah'm goin' tuh pray - ah'm gon'a pray to get well.\" Ah didn't want tuh die. Well, ah thought ah would die like ah was. So it went on that-a-w ay until ah moved - it happened so ah je st had to move. Ah would go on tuh de back porch and would sit there all de day long, and then go back and go lay down and go to sleep. If I would eat ah would go to sleep. But night come ah'd be jest like a bird, frog or snake - ah'd be up ready to go, see, go back and go to bed. Ah couldn't sleep, so ah moved. And gittin' worse and worse, move - bearin' on de heart all de time. An' ah was taken w it chills and the lady ah lived with she was thinkin' ah'd die, so when she would come upstairs 3he would call me, but when dat spell go way ah'd git up and go on down. So one day ah was laying, ah was sick and ah was layin' asleep, it was in the day and I was between sleep and awake, and a black man come - a jet black man and he come in, he come jest like dis [demonstrates]. (His - with his shoulder up to his head, sort of deformed.) [This is a usual reference to a doctor's appearance - he is a jet bLack man and queer in manner or physique.] [See, Doctor in Index.] Yes, he was and he was very old and he had stubble gray whiskers - they weren't longer stubble and he was very black. He says to me, he says, \"You're not sick [sick in a medicaL doctor's way].\" He says, \"Ah'm from Greenville, North Carolina, and I did it,\" he says, \"and I am dead and I can't rest.\" He says, \"You are a good woman,\" he says, \"but ah did this to you for\" - he called the name of the man and the name of the woman. And it was -dey done it diff'rent times. (They did it together or separately?) One didn't know what the other did. [My only example of thisl] (People that you knew?) Oh, ah knew both. [We now have reached the only example of bewitched feathers in my collection of Negro folklore. The accompanying psychology is also interesting. Both I will discuss at the end of the story.] And he came back.

If you put it on water it will come back to you.1I [The preceding quotation and everything she says shows a woman with an agile mind -a great worker and a leaturer. Her words are a conflation - two or more passages thrown together: King James Version -(1) \"The day cometh ••• all that do wickedly, shall be stubble [[not stubbed]] ••• shall burn them up ••• leave them neither root nor branch,\" Mal.l:4 - (2)\"Cast thy bread up on the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days,\" Eaal.ll:l - (3) her stubbed was suggested by stubble and \"Dash thy foot against a stone,\" Mat. 4: 6 & Lk. 4: 11.] [As I stated previously, this story is the only certain example of bewitched feathers in my Negro-folklore-collecting experience (see Feathers in Index). Not even in Quincy, Illinois - where belief in bewitched feathers survived among persons of German descent - did I ever find a colored person interested in the matter. Similarly, I found bewitched animals rare among colored people, frequent among persons of German descent. The Reason? Racial? Economic? (For bewitched feathers in Adams County Illinois and Quincy the co unty seat, see FACI, 2ed., Nos.16255-l6323, pp.853-873; bewitched animals, Nos.16l78-l6254a, pp.834-853.)] [Since some general readers may be unfamiliar with bewitched feathers, let me briefly describe them. The witchcraft spell cast upon a person is done with the feathers in the feather pillow or feather bed (feather-tiak or feather mattress) on which the victim sleeps. These feathers on which the victim lies gradually weave themselves into a form: bat (animal), bird, butterfly, chicken, rooster, coffin, cross, flowers, shapes like parts of the human body, horseshoe, etc. Sometimes these forms are combined with foreign objects: piece of clothing, key, needle, ribbon, rope, spool, thread, etc. The most frequent form of all is the wreath (symbolic of the funeral wreath) - also known as a airaular. This form occurs more often because the head lying on the pillow pushes feathers out into a circle. At times a person can hear, so it is said, the weaving in the pillow -a ticking sound (No.16293, p.865) or music in the pillow (No.16263, p.855). As soon as the form being woven is completed the victim dies. If you find a form uncompleted and burn it, the victim will recover. To demonstrate this belief further, I now quote two examples from FACI:] [\"Now I am going to tell you a story that was told by one of my [school] children. A baby [about 1931] was born in a family. Although it received the very best attention, it was not thriving. An old mother in the neighborhood entered the house one day and said, 'There is a wreath in the baby's pillow.' The mother wished to open the little pillow and take out the wreath, as had been suggested. The father scornfully laughed and forbade the mother's opening the pillow. From that moment the child grew more delicate and passed out. The old neighborhood mother entered the room and said, 'Let me examine the pillow,' which she did, and took from the pillow a perfectly formed wreath of feathers, all going in one direction. The center of the wreath was the size of the baby's head. The feathers forming the wreath were all going in one direction [se� also 16277] like the down on a dress hat. I will draw you a dfjllgram. I saw i�. It was marvelous. [The informant's diagram of this wreath Iihave reproduced 1n this book.] Underneath the wreath it seemed to be flesh/ like the flesh on a"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - C onjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -349 chicken's breast with large pores. It had no odor. Dead chicken flesh has an odor. The skin was moist as if alive. The feathers seemed to be growing. The old woman took the wreath out and burned it, and said if ever another child came to the house to give it a new pillow and it would thrive.1I (FACI, 2ed., No.16255, p.853; a picture of wreath drawn by informant being reproduced just before' the Table of Contents.)] [III knew a boy out here in the south part of Quincy years ago that was sick all the time. They done everything for him and try everything anyone would tell them, but it would not do him any good. Some of the neighbors thought he was bewitched, but the folks didn't. But at last they went to looking in the bedtick and pillows to see if they could not find anything, and in one of the pillows they found a rooster all done but a little of its tail. If that tail had of been done, that boy would of died; but they took the rooster and put it in the stove to burn, and after that the boy got wel1. 11 (FACI, 2ed., No.16289, p. 863.) J [To return to our informant, once again we meet an old routine -the doctor (M.D.) fails; the doctor (hoodoo) is called in. This time, however, there is an amazing difference both in doctor and doctor. ] [My informant refrains from criticizing hospital doctors for their inability to cure her, though she considers them impersonal and uninvolved. Naturally, the West Indian, a man of her own race would appear in a better light; at least he permitted her to have something \"to rub and ••• to gargle with.\" But, when the woman says, \"The doctors said, 'Don't give her nuthin tuh rub and ••• tuh gargle with, '\" do not believe her, though she is telling the truth from her changed point of view. After the colored doctor offered it to her, the white doctors by not offering it to her had forbidden it. This is a mere gripe. She knew the doctors had done everything medically possible; the real trouble was herself, spiritual - \"Ah'm goin' ••• go to church fo' this and ... ah'm goin' tuh pray to get wel1.\" She realizes death stared her in the face -\"Ah didn't want tuh die.\" Two steps having been taken toward health, she then took a third -\"I t happened so ah jest had to move.\"] [Despite her changed attitude, she still refused to accept any blame for her condition - a man and woman separately would not have hoodooed her had she been all sweetness and light! She needed a scapegoat. Scapegoat also would permit her to satisfy those childhood beliefs and fears which had floated to the surface during her illness. Too intelligent to call in a hoodoo doctor, she summ ons the spirit of a dead hoodoo doctor. He appears not as master giving orders but as sinner seeking forgiveness - his eternal future depending upon her. She, of course, is the spirit of the dead hoodoo doctor. Thus disguised she saves the soul of a sinner (his - actually her own) and cures herself by forgiving him (finding the bewitched feathers). In forgiving him she forgives herself. If you don't forgive yourself neither God nor Church can do it for you - though either or both may smooth the way. This solution of my informant's is the brilliancy and power that comes with a dream. This is also my guess about what happened. Each reader is entitled to a similar guess.] [Washington, D.C., (629), 808:3.] TIME AND HOODOO SPELL [Time in hoodoo is very important and covers a wider scientific medicine.

[Several years ago [19J6?] my sister and I [[Harry Middleton Hy att, the author]] whi le in the country heard of an erysipe las cure that had been worked with an Indian arrowhead by an old woman fo rmerly well known as a healer. Our informant� who was re lated to the healer 's family � did not knOw any detai ls� but said two of the old woman's sons� elderly men� were still alive -the one� a nearby farmer� professionally engaged in the healing tradition of the family; the other� a business man� the owner of a hardWare store in the small town a few mi les away. I decided to visit the business man fi rst. The purchase of a dipper� which I actually wanted� served as an excuse. After the usual talk about things in general - the weather (it was about ninety-five in the shade)� people on re Zief� business conditions� prospects from the approaching h.arvest - I told the man who I was� exp lained my work� and offe red what credentials I could muster. Fortunately� he knew a boyhood friend of mine who at that time lived on a farm in the neighborhood� and he had also known my father. He became quite fr iendly. Our conversation ended something like this: \"So you Ire going over to see my brother about that old cure of my mother 's. \" He seemed amused. \"Wait a minute. \" He went over to his desk� opened a drawer� took out tbJo impZements� held them up and asked� \"What do you think of them?\" One of the objects was an Indian arrowhead; the other was a piece of steel shaped Zike this - u-shaped � -two prongs sticking out from a handle. \"WonderfuZ! May I hold them?\" \"Sure. \" / \"Your mother's?\" \"No� mine. Fact is� I've done that cure for years . Not so much �ntly. Just do it as a favor. Only c ure I know.

No danger of skinning your hand. \" \"Must you use an arrowhead?\" \"No, any kind of flint wi II cw. But my mother used an arroWhead. I found this one myseZf. \" \"Have you ever toZd anyone how y ou use the se?\" \"No. \" \"Could you?\" \"Yes, but I couldn 't teU you. Have to teU a Woman. And I have to te U a woman younger than myself. And she could only teZl a man, and he wouZd have to be younger than her.

Suppose I go out, send her in, .and After some hesitation he agreed to the pZan. So I went out, explained the hocus pocus to my sister, and she went into the store whiZe I stayed in the car. In about a half hour my sister came out. We had the cure . Wrote ewwn the detai Zs immediately. Here they are. You must hold a piece of steel in your right hand and strike downwards on a fZint heZd by your Zeft hand -our informant called this striking fire - as you go through the fo ZZoWing four actions of the complete rite : (1) Start at the top of the patient's head, in the center, begin to strike down on the flint, making sparks; then, come ewwn, sloWly, continuing the sparks, over the right ear, shoulder and arm, to the finger tips; and, while striking these sparks from the top of the head ewwn to the fi nger tips of the right hand, you must repeat three times: \"Whi le fire fUes away � Tame fire devours you. \" This whole act must be done three times; hence, the incantation is repeated nine times. (2) Start at the top of the patient's head, in the center, and strike sparks down to the left finger tips while repeating the incantation three times. This whole act must be done three times. (3) Start at the top of the pa tient's head, in the center, and strike sparks dawn over the face, nose, mouth, center of the body as far as there is pain or the disease can be seen, eVen if it extends to the toes. The incantation must be said three times and the whole act repeated three times. (4) Start at the t op of the patient's head')_in the center, and strike sparks cwwn the back of the head, down the middle of the back, a nd �r as the pain or disease extends, even to the heels if necessary. Repeat the incantation three times and the whoZe act three times. The complete rite - containing the four separate acts, each of which, as already stated, is repeated three times - must be performed after sunset or"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"374 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -before sunrise� and it mus t be repeated on three different occasions as follows: if you commence after sunset� perfo� the comple te rite at that time� then again just before the following sunrise, and then again after the next sunset; if you commence before sunrise, perfo� the complete rite at that time, then again just after the following sunset, and then again just before the next sunrise. Now� if the complete rite performed on three separate occasions fails to cure the patient�'wait awhile� three days or a rrruUiple of three, and perform the rite again; then wai� once more, and perfo� the rite for the third time. Therefore, in--this extreme case� the complete rite is perfo�ed 9 times and each of the 4 acts 27 times -which means going down the body 128 times and repeating the incantation 324 times. And if this fails to cure the patient� I do not know what happens . Probably the healer will need a healer for himself. This remedy, which has been worked in the community since about 1850, Was brought over from Ge�any by the informant's grandmother. With our arrowhead cure safely bestowed, and with high hopes� we next went out to see the other brother, the professional healer. He refused to tell us anything .

So she buried a bottle at my gate and I goes in the gate that evening from my work, a pain struck me in this foot. Well, I rubbed , I rubbed , I bathed and the more I rubbed the worser it'd get . And my foot busted open on top and worms like -you've seen wood sawyers, haven't you? Well, they's crawl out of my foot. [These beetles probably pine sawyers.] Well, there was an old man - he was a two-headed man -old man Ellis Perdue. He's dead now. He lived that far from me - from here [to] across the street.

He goes and buys this first hog lard - you know, the leaf like you buy and dry it up (render] yourself.

That's to bathe me in all over , I start from here down (demonstrates ]. (From your head down.) For nine mornings, bathe me down in it to my feet.

That's just the experience of me. My feet was layin' open , just like you about that far [demonstrates ] , like you take a knife and split it open and those worms crawled out. And he told me, he says, \"Long as you live, you get you two silver dimes and wear 'em on your legs , to keep anybody from putting anything down for you. But I've been hurt since then because I got jealous. The strings of my dimes rotted and I lost 'em in the bed. Course I put 'em up but I never did put 'em back on, but I've been hurt through my minastratin' . Yes, sir , I was hurt here in New Orleans - n ext month it'll be five ye ars ago. (How did that happen?) We�l , my daughter died. My enemies through the death of my daughter come in my hous�. ___ I was minastratin', you know, like women will pull their pieces off and be careless sometimes . I left one of my pieces and I put it down and the woman got my piece and buried me in the graveyard . Well, she stopped me up. I was stopped up fifteen days before I could minastrate. I was took with pains in my stomach, in knots like that and I was turning dark. So on a Tuesday at twelve o'clock I w as cutting some turnip greens at my table . I had boarders, you know -I was selling lunches and selling liquor - bootlegging. And a pain hit me right in here and right back here and throwed me just like you would knock me down. In the bottom part of my stoma ch , right down just above my cross-bone and just above my rectum back here, and I fell just like you would, you see, just somebody knock you down. So they come and they picked me up and they put me in the bed and I rang up for the doctor . He co me and he give me a hyperdermic. That hyperdermic set me on fire . I looked like I was - I just clawed everything, my pain was so severe in my body that I just wanted to tear up everything I could get my hands on. So I had a white doctor -it was a colored doctor that come [the first time} - so-r got my insurance doctor, a white doctor, and the more medicine he'd give me � worse I'd git. So there was an old lady in the block. She come to see me. She lives in the block where I live now . She told my mother, she said, \"That girl is hurt .\" She said, \"You go to the drug store and get ten cents of jW7laaa ginger,\" 'you know what that is, \"and you boil it and you give her that tea, just as hot as she can drink i t, three nights straight.\" I drank that tea . And then she said, \"You soak her feet in that saltpeter , red pepper and table salt and her uPinate . \" My feet was white as cotton without a drop of blood in 'em in my feet . I was burning up from here down to my feet and up here I was freezing to death. So my mother did that and when my minastratin ' come on it was b lack as that coat you have on [see Coat, author's black, in Index}. I stayed that way a solid month. I was weighin ' 164 pounds - when I got up I was weighin ' 92. And 100 pounds of ice a day I used. I had a foot-tub and I had to crush that ice and lay on the side of the bed like this with a pillow at the foot of my bed to try to sleep with my feet in that tub of water until I was burning up . If I didn't have 'em in that ice water , it looked like you just had fire made against my feet, burning me up . I was burning up from my knees down and I was freezing here [from knees up]. And when I'd get tired of laying like this, my mother would put me in the bed and I bought one of these big bot-water bottles , and I'd crush the ice and put it in there and lay it against the foot of the bed and rest my feet on it, so I c ould rest my body . You see I'd get tired of being cramped like this . __ c. That 's just the experie nce of me since I've been here.

[In the following whooping-cough cure a mean trick is played on the spirit causing the disease:] Everybody else in the family when they ben' ovah with they han's EXPELLED on each othah's back directly in front the first person , [each INTO THE AIR person] right behind a person put his hands on his back [the back of the person in front] and - go right behind each, put his hands on my [sick person's back] and the person won't cough no more and the whoop will go down the line to the last person and go. [This is my original transcription in pencil; a note on it reading , \"Whooping cough cure - final transcription.\" The person with whooping cough bends over -behind him a line of bent-over persons forms, each laying his hands on the back of the person in front. The spirit of whooping cough is interested and enters into the spirit of the game. The diseased person whoops and the spirit makes his first mistake . Instead of reentering the diseased person, the spirit hops into the second person . Then the second person wh oops and the spirit jumps into the third person - and so on down the line. When the last person in line whoops, the spirit jumps backward into the air - he is homeless and the diseased person is cured. 1 [How can a spirit having power to change form and to'go anywhere be so easily fooled? Why doesn't he quickly reenter the last person in line? As I previously remarked, a spirit is a simple-minded creature (No. 505 , p.152). He had had a delightful experience playing the new game jumping-backwards; it would never occur to him suddenly to jump f orwards. Besides , every person in the bent-over line was intending and willing or wishing him out into space.

The doctors did TRlFORM TRANSFERENCE not seem to understand what was the trouble with her. They did everything they could for her but nuthin seemed to do her no good . Finally they g ot a different kind of doctor. It was a woman who was supposed to understand all about it. When she came she looked at her and she said, \"Can't you see this snake?\" She meant she wa s tricked by a s nake. \"Why, the time is past when she should die. She should have been dead a month ago. It is only her vitality that kept her alive.\" She said she would try to do what she could for her. She [the sick woman] said she didn't want to make nobody else in the condition she was in . [She did not want her condition turned back on the person who had caused it.] So she [the doctor] got a chicken she could throw this dis ease on instead of throwing it on to a person . They kept it upstairs in the room next to the woman. \"Keep it well fed [said the doctor].\" She didn't want the chi cken to die. \"Don't let no one touch the chicken [said the doctor].\" If anyone got a hold of that chicken they would kill it. They didn't want the peop le downstairs to kill it, for they knew what it was there for . They thought these people were causing that sickness . After they got this chicken , sure enough the girl began to get better . At that time they use to get at least a quart of bran every day from that bed. It came off of her skin . It looked like - you seen husks of the meal after corn [maize] is ground. After they used to take that up from the sheet they used to put it in a paper bag and carry it and throw it into the river . They said that would help to get her well. It came off of her body each day - the skin rubbed off. You have seen the scales rubbed off of a fish. Her skin looked just like that , just like people begin to peel around the nails in scarlet fever. The woman told her she would have to cross water. The doctors they didn't want them to bring her away. They didn't have a case like that. They wanted to follow the case to the end . She came on here [to New York City] . She didn't live long after she got here, her condition was so weak . I guess it was the change of climate , too . I don't know what happen after I left home to the chicken. That chicken walking around, I tell you what it was like - it got on my nerves. The stuff from the bowels of that chicken would be just as green as grass -poison. [The doctor correctly diagnosed this severe case of desquamation as caused by a snake ; correctly , hoodooica1ly speaking. Doesn't a s nake shed it 's skin? Much more is involved. We have here a rare situation. A snake tricked into a patient fails to create; that is , fails to develop into a snake from a swallowed snake egg, or to reform the original snake body from dead-snake powder. Had the snake egg or powder created a body , the living body of this snake within the patient could h ave been removed easily (see margin-title LiVe Things in You, p.227, and Index). Instead of a living snake we have a snake spirit. How does a snake spirit display itself? A patient will act like a snake : crawl , dart out tongue or run it round lips [as a snake is supposed to do) , have long sleep periods (hibernation), and peel off skin (ecdysis) . Our doctor comb ines three rites , the magic three : if the healthy chicken fails to attract the snake spirit from the patient, the fish scaLes (snake scaLes) when thrown into running water will carry away a part of the snake spirit (Part of spirit EquaLs WhoLe of Spirit, p.2l) ; and if these two fail, the patient crossing water will loose the snake spirit -spirit cannot cross water.] [New York City, (4) , Ed.; informant born in county"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"386 -Memoirs of Alma Eg an Hyatt Foundation -near Norfolk, Va. , and later lived there.] 1001.

Years ago someone living near him had been bi tten by a mad dog� and the �ner of a madstone was called in to work the cure. The latter began by putting his madstone against the bite� where it stuck for a long time like a magne t and could not be removed. This signified� said the operator� that the madstone was sucking out the poison; fUPther� as soon as it was thoroughly saturated� it would d:r>op Off the wound. Thus the madstone eventually let loose� and he placed it in a crock of milk which turned grey immediately. This process of administering the madstone and then dipping it into the milk was repeated seven times . When. it was app lied fo r the eighth time� it no longer adhered� indicating that all the poison had been extracted; but to make certain, the healer asked for another crock of milk and swished the madstone in it as a fi na l test.

Aladdin 's lamp was not a hand because anyone could rub it to activate the indwelling sp irit . Quite otherwise a hand concerns known user -it being dPessed, powered for him alone , usually toward a single purpose. ] [We have already examined many handS: the BLack Cat Lucky Bone (pp . 74-97); healing hands in Cure and Protection (pp .4l0-5l9) ; divining hands in Diagnosis (pp. 165-2l7) , particularly the taZking hand� Jack (pp. 190-l93) . TaZking hand reminds me that hand has other names , among them -toby� guide� shieZd� root8� mojo� jomo (transposition of syllables in mojo) , and hoodoo bag.] [Of interest are what I name battery handS - those that lose strength and must be recharged or they weaken and die. Recharging is called feeding and substances fed are whiskey, perfumes, urine and other liquids. Spirits do not eat solid food . A spirit of course never dies ; it merely deserts its temporary dwelling place. Similarly , desertion happens to a lost hand -some informants believing the hand returns to its maker!] [A hand can become a fetish, even a part of oneself. Most instructive here . are Ziving handS -the unfortunate chicken (No . 205, p.58) , and the two wandering snakes (No . 239, p.66.] 1706.

As to form, one informant said the bLack cat bone was \"made lak de breast of a chicken\" (No . 316 , p.94) , meaning the furculum or wishbone in front of but not a part of the chicken breastbone . Similarly , another informant described bLack cat bone as \"gon'a have three forks [prongs or tines] ••• two long forks an' a little small fork\" (No . 299 , p.88) . I suggested this three-pronged fork could have been a \"devil's trident.\" Actually the \"little small fork\" could have been the hypo­cLeidium -the end adhering to the winning half of the broken wishbone.

Get graveya� dust and get a shell off of somebody's grave and scrape some of that dust off raw, then you put it on the fire and you boil it an hour -put this shell on and boil the shell.

Then you put this shell in a little boiling pot and you put it on the fire and you let it boil hard for a solid hour, and as this boils , why you make your wish to yourself . [This animal shell used on the grave as an ornament was a fresh-water bivalve mollusk of several related genera once abundant in the Mississippi River valley drainage system. Before the First World War almost every town on the Mississippi had a pearl-button factory with its huge pile of punched-out shells - shells full of regularly spaced round holes left after punching out the crude buttons . Along the river too, musselers floated their small flat-bottom boats having two racks of hooks parallel to the boat so that they could be easily baited and over the boat sides lowered into or raised out of the water . The largest shell I ever saw was 8-10 inches ; the industry shells were much smaller.] When the hour [of boiling ] is over, then you take it [the shell] off and you scrape off some of that [cooked] dust -you just scrape it off and you put some of that in a little bag , and you sew it [all these ingredients] up with silk thread and try and not put over fifty stitches in there. When you make your first stitch , leave the thread about that long [demonstrates] . (About as long as your finger.) And the last one, leave it the same length, so that you can always hold it by �, because wherever there is money , that's called a Jack [see comment later]. And he gon'a kick you -it will jump. Now the whole thing is the Jack, but the loop - you s ee you kin catch it to hold it by that and [or] fas ten it to you . Now, if you are a gambling person see , it 's lucky for you -keep that on you. As long as you keep that on there, you'll have no need of playing -you jest as well let 'em hand it [the money] to you . While you are there won't nothing· harm you. And now, m aybe you'll say, \"Oh , I wouldn't mind havin' a game in there. Don't know if they got any money or not .\" Well now , you jist walk around in there and you'll feel this move. [Despite informant 's brilliant pun , \"Wherever there is money, that's called a Jack\" (slang for money) , money in a ha nd does not make it a Jack (see margin­title Jack, pp . 190-l93 and Index).

[Your own heart becomes a living handl ] [Brunswick, Ga. , (1223),2078:6. ] 1995. At Williamsburg , Virginia, at the Colonial Hotel, the place I was work­ing at , I was working with a boy called Massey . He was about the luckiest boy around the job. He would go away from the job , stay as long as he want, come back to the job and still hold a g ood hand with the boss. HAND -HEART-SHAPED One evening on a dice game I was betting in the game with Massey. Massey and I were good friends . So after the game was over, I having lost all my money , Massey having won all the money in the game , he gave me my money back and warned me not to play in a game again if he was in the game. I wanted to know why. He opened his shirt at the collar and showed me a little bag , a little dirty bag, of some contents I don' t know what , pinned over his heart . It was the shape of a heart. [I saw one heart-shaped hand -see No. 1053 , p.399.] He told me that this little bag would always pro­tect him in any game , for love or for money. He told me that he bought this little bag from an old man that lived far back in the woods and the path that led to his home was well travelled becaus e there was always seen cars ab out his home. He told me that he paid this man fifty dollars for this little bag , two dollars down on deposit, and if it worked he paid the other forty-eight dollars. One afternoon I told him that if his bag could work let me see him work it on a white man. He was working for Dr . B. Dr. B. was the owner of the hotel . He had a nice automobile, an automobile that he had just paid $3300 for ; and we had been accustomed to renting a car at a garage ab out four blocks up the street when we wanted to go to a ball game, dances and things of that kind . On th is partic­ular afternoon the car that we had rented, somebody else had rented it already . I said to Mas sey , \"Now , your bag, if it is working, let me see it work now.\" I told him I would give him five dollars if his bag worked on Dr . B, so far as us getting his car . He told me to come on and lay the bet and go with him, and I when I saw him rub his hand on th e bag I would know that th e bag was working . He went to the doctor and asked him to let us use his car. He was doing the talking. I have know Dr. B's daughter ask him to let her use the car and he would turn her down. After Massey had spoken to the doctor, he suddenly rubbed his hand over his heart. The doctor told him he couldn't let him take the car b ecause the tire had been condemned. In fact he had to return it to the people he had bought it from and get another for it. Massey ran his hand over that bag again . Quickly the countenance on the d octor's face changed and he began to smile, and said to Massey , \"Take that car , go on to the ball game and bring it back, take it to the garage and take the tire to those people and tell them that I want another one .\" If the bag worked I don't know . I only know that I lost five dollars . [Ocean City , Md . , (14) , Ed .] 1996. It's something mostly in the shape of a heart, but what's in it I don't know. This is a hand for good luck .

After efforts at various times I finally came up with paUna Christi (hand of Christ), anglicized form paUncrist - the cast or-oil plant (Ricinus communis). Informant' s word seed probably confused me, because during my boyhood castor-oil plant seeds were called beans. They are still called castor beans , are poisonous because of ricin in them, and are nonetheless the source of castor oil. My only other folk­lore experience with the plant is a strange one : \"It is against the law to cut down a castor-bean p lant\" -FA CI , 1st ed. , 1935, p.429. This could be one of those many inversions in folklore , as in life, meaning - \" It is unlawful·to grow a plant having po isonous seeds.\"] [Memphis, Tenn. , (1529), 2733:2.] 2200 .

That root? Looks like a spear?) [My questions are ridiculous in words. Actually here is a good example of occasional hand-talking . For little thing I indicate a low bush looking like a palm - I had seen millions of palmettos up and down the southeastern coast. To make certain we meant the same plant, I air-draw a cleft leaf - each cleft Zooks like a spear. Informant's answer shows the result.] Yes , sir , got big wide leaves on it. (All right, all right.) Well, you get a he palm etto root. Y ou take this he palmetto root and you bring it to your house and you cut it off just at that bush. After you cut it off at that bush , you put three splits in it - right in the bottom of that root , you put three splits in it. And you takes the judge's name, t he dist rict attor­ney's and the prosecuting attorney's name in there. Put it [names] on a piece of paper nine times backwards, you understand. And put it [paper] in between them splits, understand , and wear th at in your pocket. I guarantee you they'll [the law will] all stay away from there. (That 's if you are bootlegging?)

On Monday morning between 9:30 and 10 'clock I had to rush her to Garfield 's Hospital. And with them taking her to the hospital on that Monday morning , of having several specialists to examine her , to give her a thorough examination from time to time , and each one of them said that her body showed as though it was normal from start to f i nish. Well, her mother said that it was a spell. Later on, the one that she had taken dinner with begin to talk and tell other people about what she had done. And she said this , that she'd taken the skin of a frog and put it in a pan and cooks it real crisp and powders it up and give it to her in coffee and that was the cause of her sickness and also her death. Dr . Fowler , being at the time the head surgeon of the doctorical staff of the District, he give a thorol examination and said that he couldn't locate or tell what her disease was -even up to her death. I noticed on the night - on Saturday night -like she died Sunday morning, I was there at the hospital all that night. I notice between the skin and her flesh there were the figure of frogs . Her eyes begin to turn yellowish - de white of her eyes and her head . She suffered with ve ry severe pains . After the doctors couldn't find out , even by taken a picture - they said her heart were perfect, her stomach perfect, her liver perfect , kidneys perfect -her whole system. But by the misery being in her head , dey couldn't figure or tell whether it might have been a form of an abscess somewhere on the tissue of the brain.

Well, it goes on to show me that the fruits of the thing that which she [the other woman] had said that she had done was true. Later on ah begin to seek into such [the truth of hoodoo] .

Our best examples of this are those magic obj ects closest to the believer's heart and mind -the handS.

A hand lives and helps only because a spirit dwells in it. Even when all amenities and regulations have been kept and the indwelling spirit is contended, it can be kil led -chased from i ts temporary home - by the spirit of a stronger hand. Ki l ling happens often in a gambling game where every man carries a hand. So, here is another rule of magic - a weaker spirit cannot function in th e presence of a stronger spirit. But the owner of the weaker hand can kill the spirit or power of the stronger hand - page 641 and Index.] Well, she thought she was fixing him -instead of fi xing him fo' good, she was fixing him fo' bad looked like, don't you see, because whut dis woman give her , de mixture in his food, see.

And so when I come home from work that evenin' the bottle was there. And so the bottle had water in it, I imagine. My mother told me not to open it. It had a lot of needles and a stopper and a cord­string tied up as if , you know, to hold the stopper out of the water - just a plain long beer bottle [probably a dark bottle] . So my mother had taken it up to a wo man what, you know, knew. (Where was this bottle?) It was at my house - it was down by the washstand . They had give it to - the woman had give it to my brother, s ee. And my brother went and give it to my mother and my mother set it down in my room by the washstand and so she told me when I come home to go th ere and get the bottle. So, finally , I had a fear run over me and besides , about it, I never believed in this kind of stuff until this come about . And so after she told me to go and get the bottle, I went and opened [I wanted to open] it - I said, \"Mama, t his bottle is suspicious.\" She says, \"Well, don't open it.\" I say , \"Yes , Ma, I is, I'm not afraid. \" She said , \"Don't you open it.\" And she taken the bottle and went on up to a woman's house with the bottle and she told the woman. The woman told my mother to take the bottle and empty it in a bayou of water or stream of water. See. So I went to Tallulah to work. I left from away from there after I thought I was going to get hurt , you know. I left home anyway and I went to Tallulah . (Where is that?) Tallu lah , Louisiana.

And after he wrote in a letter and told me about a dream I had. I believed in what he was telling me to do. (Did you have a dream?) I had a dream that I - there was some money in a old empty house for me. [For dreams of buried treasure, see 387 , p.116; 426, p.127; etc.] And after I wrote this man like she [the girl] told me to write him, why he was telling th at , and I was -and that 's what made my belief come that he'd know wh at he was talking about -why I believed in what he told me to do. (Now, wait.

I sent the money to him and he sent me a self-addressed stamp [env elope for the money] . And he sent me and told me what to do, and he sent me black candles and he told me this here black candle would burn against the parties what was harming me. Well , he told what to do - he told me to take a glass about like that , just an ordinary jelly glass , and fill it half full of sugar and stick it down in the su gar . (This black candle?) This black candle. (Just one?) He sent me more than one, cause [ I sent him] $5.06, but after they give out, he told me I could get ' em from my local drug store. And he told me to use these candles six , twelve and six evening every evening . [This is the well-known 6-12-6 time formula. ] And finally I did that. (Put this candle down in the sugar?)

Fifteen minutes -fifteen minutes, (And wh en you had burned one whole candle?) No , sir , you burn that every day . (Well, when that first candle burned out , w hat did you do? Burn another one then?) Could use another. (How many did you use altogether?) Oh , I just guess. I done even forgot how many I used , but I used just some of 'em 'cause I wanted that off of me.

What informant wanted could be taken care of for $5.75 . Her dream about the buried treasure showed that all prob lems would soon be solved; she would also find the hidden wealth. The reader will notice immediately that $5.75 contains uneven numbers , which read inside outward 75 and outside inward 57. This is for­ward and backward magic, though not the pendulum magic frequently met in Jacks (p. 190f.). Pulsating or heart-be at magic might be a better term. After the money was received, t he candles were delivered. The package contained a printed notice something like : \"These candles you ordered have been burned in the fo l­lowing manner by troubled persons who claim for them the benefits of health and peace . We sell them as curios. The so-and-so drug store in your town sells these candles .\" There was no second letter as informant implies . All communi­cation was brief and vague (see He'd Never Write You Much , p.3l 9f.). McConnick is primarily a distributor of candles - a business man and surely a white man. ] [Vicksburg, Miss., (769) , 1058:1.] 2752. My husband left me and I wanted him to come back. I loved the man , I love him 'till today, and he jist walked away from me without any cause that I know of. Course I was jealous of 'im and I wouldn't let 'im ACROSS THE RIVER go when he felt like going all the time to those awful taverns ALGIERS because he was drunkard - ev 'ry time he go o ut he'd get drunk. Well, I tried to keep him at the house all I could and make things as pleasant as I could for him , see - so he would like home, see. I had a beautiful home across the street there, a nd there was nothing for him to worry for. He was a working man, he was no sweetie -he was a working man, worked every da y. But when he'd go out and get amongst mens and womens , he'd get drunk and carry on. And if he had his payday before he came in , he'd let 'em rob him. He 'd be home all the week, ev'ry day in the week , but on Saturday night when he got his pay he'd go ev 'rywhere but home. I got disgus ted with h im .

Course, poor soul, she'd dead , but she was a crack shot. I guess you have heard talk of her . (How long has she been dead?) She been dead now going on three years. Yes .

My work was ho usework. (Just housework?) Yes . (You didn't have anything to do with the customers then?) No, I didn't have anythi ng to do with the customers.

(Was Madam Helen a white woman?) Yes , sir , she was a white woman - white lady. (Isee:-I see.) She was a crackerjack. (She received both the colored and white people?) Both the colored and white people, but she had her days picked for the white. She had , I think on Thursday , Wednesday , something like , for the white. Now, on a Friday, that would be especially for the colored and Mondays -that would be-­their days. She would work four days and that was all. And iffen you was badly hurt, well, you could come and she would keep you there with her . Now, if you'd be colored, w ell, I'd 'tend to you like in a patient. I'd 'tend to you in the bed 'cause she had to keep you there to doctor on you anything herself . Well, I'd 'tend to you myself and I'd bring your dinner and your breakfast or empty your slop and keep your room clean, you see. (I see, if you were what?)

So she tole me , \"Don't send no money by the mail, just send it in a plain letter.\" So I sent her money just like she said. I sent $5.00 on the first pay­ment. She asked me how I g ot paid.

Well, now , I tell you about the hair. A person takes some of your hair and cut it out of your head. I know a man did me that - that's the reason I tell you so good about it. My husband was laying and I was laying down in the bed and I was asleep -laying down on my back. He couldn't find my scissors , he got up and got the case knife. I heard something going - saw - saw - saw -you know, and I woke up like that. He was setting up in the bed - had my hair sawing a piece of it, got it out . So I went to the hair-dresser and she said , \"What is your hair doing cut out. \" I said, \"My hair ain't cut out my head.\" She missed it, and she say, \"Yes , it is. \" I say, \"Oh, Lord, I don't remember cutting my hair out for nobody.\" I say , \"Gee, 1'm going to watch my husband tonight when he come.\" He was working in the swamp and when he take a bath that ni ght , I goes in his clothe s and I look and he had a plat of my hair in his pocket. I said , \"What you going to do with that hair?\" He say, \"I cut this here, DaiSY, \" he call me Daisy , \"to keep you with me I cause I love you\" - to keep me from g oing away from him. A Egyptian woman told me - I went to her - she say, \"You suffering with your head . \" I say , ''Yes .'' She say , \"Some man cut your hair out your head and he dead.\" [See margin-title If Evildoer Dies Spell Incurable, p.396.] I say, \"Yes , what did he do with it?\" She say, \" He take it to a tree in the woods and he bore a hole in that tree,\" and she say, \"while he may - he put that hair in the tree,\" she say , \"and then he closed it.\" That what the Egyptian woman told me. I say , \"Well, what you think he want to do that for?\" She told me, s he sa y, \"He didn't want to kill you , but he wanted you to be crazy about him -cause that would make you crazy , make you follow him e verywhere.\" Because he wanted me to go to that [camp something?] and he working there - and he wanted me to go and I didn't go. She say , \"Well, you go on with him.\" So, well, my husband he got - he put my hair in the tree. He bore towards the sunrise. He got on the side of the sunrise and he dug the hole and she told me how to go there to get that hair. I went there right away and just like she told me, it was true - my hair absolutely was there. I went and I take a knife and I dug the p lug out. And my hair had done grow ed long and I taken it out and it cold-like.

Well, I was on two opinions . I didn't know 'aht to do. The Egyptian UJoman had told me about my hair and Miss Helen done told me it was the blood. Well, I got operated on. That didn't do no good and I said it must be true what the Egyptian woman say. And I go - what the Egyptian woman told me - and I goes and that's wh ere I found my hair was in the tree.

[I am repeating his his. ] [At this point my transcriber knew what informant was talking ab out and over every preceding word hand typed t he word hen l The word hen was often pronounced han or han or something else. When people were closer to country life than they ar e today, the word dominic was fairly common. A variation of the w ord appears in the following couplet: \"Dominickep [speckled] sky ; s torm close by\" -FACI, 1st ed ., 1935, No . 540, p.21. I question the preceding word \"sells\" in the text: \"Sells it . It's a dominic hand [hen].\" As soon as hand is replaced by hen , the word seZZs is nonsense. The word should be speZd8 [= splits from Scotland] -see one of the remedies under margin-title Zippy Tull.

Yeah , every morning she do that, for nine mornings straight , but she still had to go over there nine mornings. See? That was to help to take this condition off of her . See? And after she did that for nine mornings , well, she stopped , but she continued to take this bath . See, she warned her and told her forever to take this bath because if some more harm was to come to her and if she would take this saltpeter and household ammonia and bathe herself in it, and some running water , that no evil could come to her . You understand? It wou ld guard her -it would be some kind of a safeguard to her. Saltpeter is supposed to have, be pro­tective for all such lines of hoodooism. (And you wife got well?) Yes, sir , she's well and working today . (I see. Now , what your wife got hurt with . Was it goofer dus t?) Gooier dust, yeah . (What's that?) [See, Goofer dust , pp . 222-227, and Index. ] That' s a hoodoo -it's a powder. You call it goofer dust.

Yeah , well, the saint [is] over [above candles] that - well then, everything you promise him , if you promised to give him a flower or give him a rose - well then, when the time comes to you to give it to him - and you do ne be succes sful what you have asked for - well, you come and you put that flower there, y ou know, in some water . Well, then you'll always have luck. But the minute that you fail in g iving him what you promised - that what you - that junk what you g ot around there, probably you may have some pa per around there on the mantelpiece or wher­ever y ou got it, or in the corner - you might have a curtain or something like that - well , there's some kind of way it going to blow into that and ketch on fire - burn down -and after that you have worse luck than you ever had . [New Orleans, La ., (829), 1229:1.] 3035. (How do you do that in trying to rent them? ) Well, the onlies t way you could do , you could take - just like if you knew anything, you go to the Crackerjack Drug Store and you use you some lights . You get you a green light and you burn in -like a altar - you know, like a little altar in your home? Well , you burn that [candle] and you ma ke your wish, you understand , for to rent the house and you'll rent ev'ry one of your rooms . Your customers will pay you ev'ry day , like if they [rent-collector] come ev 'ry week . (I see. You just burn that candle . You don't burn anything to a saint's picture or anything of that sort?) Yes, you burn it right to a saint - y ou burn it to St. Peter. (You burn it to St. Peter .) That's what those ladies burn to - to St. Peter. (What do men burn it to? ) And men burns to the Virgin Mary. Understand? (Well, why do the men burn to the Virgin Mary?) Because she' s a lady , you see . Well, she's the one helps the men ; but St. Peter , he's don't help the men at all. See, St. Peter -just like if you have St. Peter in your home -St. Peter, if you try to light a light to St. Peter, � liab le to set your house af ire before he do a favor for you [a man], but a woman, he .would do a favor for her. [New Orleans, La ., (841), 1270:3.] 3036 . Well, St. P eter , he's good and he 's bad, but you gotta handle St. P eter so rough. (You got to do wh at with him? Handle him rough?) Yes, you gotta treat him dirty , whatever words I mean . If you drink , you gotta wet him with liquor. [See BEER FOR ST . PETER] , and if you curse and live a bad life, you go tta be cursing . You gotta git up and pull your clothes up and"},{"pageNumber":940,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -875 pat yourself down there and all that. Then, if you promise him some thing and d on't give it to him, he' ll set your house afire. H e won't burn up the whole house but he'll burn everything you got in the house and then the fir e'll go out. (How do you mean you pull your clothes up and pat yours elf?) Your backside to him. (You show him your backside?) Yes. You have to treat him dirty, treat him mean , on account of he was so mean. He wasn't what he professed to be. He was a follower of Christ and when Christ got into the judgment hall he didn't know nuthin about him. He got outside and go to fightin'. He cut the man's ear off. He was just a bad man, don't you see. And so you gotta handle him just like now as when he was on earth. Then [after you \"treat him dirty\"], you gotta handle him nice or he won't be bothered with you. You gotta g ive him keys too, because if you don\"'t give him a key he'll keep every door shu� and he' ll no t open the door for you . [New Orleans, La. , (855),1349:4. ] 3037. There 's St. Peter. St. Peter is a saint they use with a black candle. (A black candle? What de they do with St. Peter?) You see, you set that cand le to St. Peter and you ligh t this candle to St. Peter and you say to S t. Peter - and you make a prayer -make a p rayer , but have th ese people -their name. When you are prayin', you call these people name, and you set this black candle there, and this black candle has got so many days to burn . And you begin to suffer with a headache or diz ziness in t he head - well, this black candle then is burnin' on you. After this candle is burned out, then you begin to feel droopy -feel like you don't car e about gettin ' up in the mornin'. Then, fin'lly, in the longer run you begin to get weak. The first thing, you'l l take to your bed; but that can be stopped, if a person know how to stop it. [New Orleans, La. , (786) ,1091:2.] 3 038. Well, it's according -you can burn a pink one, you can burn a yellow one, you can burn a whi te one, for luck. (Well, how do you burn those various candles ?) Now , you take -say for 'n'instance like when I was on my truck . I had a truck. I used to get me those yel low candles , you see. Either yellow or white will do. I get my candle and I'd ligh t my candle in the mornings 'fore seven o'clock. I used to go to church for them. And 'fore seven o'clock I'm got my candle, I'd light my candle on my truck. I wouldn't got out of my truck. I'd burn the candle and whilst burning my candle, I'd use cinnamon and sugar. I'd burn that in my truck. I'd put that in the candle and I'd burn that in my truck . I had St. Peter and I had St. Joseph. I'd light my candles to them and I'd pray 1:0 them. (In your h ouse?) No sir, on my truck. (Oh , you did this in the truck?) In the street, no house at all -in the street, anywheres in the street, when the time comes. I would burn that. That was for my luck. All right. Twelve o 'clock, I'd burn it -burn my candle again at three o'clock and during that day I never had a misfortune a t all. During that day I made -if it wasn't but five or six dollars, I made that. [New Orleans, La., (832), 1243 :3.] 3039. (What about St. Peter?) He is -he totes the key. He unlocks the door to yuh , but if you don 't give him what you promise, he'll burn you out. He burnt me out once, that's how I know. --(How did he burn you out?)"},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":"876 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hy att Foundation -Well, you see, I had promised him a quarter. Well, I wasn 't ab le to give him that quarter that certain day, and I left a little bit of fire in my furnace in my room, locked up , and goes out. When I comes back -I didn't see no way in the world that that fire could pop out and set noth ing afire. All my clothes and one side of the house was in a light blaze. You gotta give him wh at you promise him. [New Orleans , La. , (851) , 1318:4.] 3040 . (What ab out St. Peter? ) He'll do evil for anything you want done. He' ll do it for you. (St. Peter will?) Yeah , St. Peter will do that. Well how, for example? Well now, if I wanted St. Peter to do something for me , I would take a pin and I will scratch my finger , or either my own self , and let it bleed , bleed , bleed , and I'll take a pen and write. And I 'll write a letter with my own blood and I'll take it to the cros sroads and I'll leave it there, and I'll get him fin'lly to do anything I ask him to do . He 'll do it and then after that I kin do anything, too. See. (You write a letter in your own blood and go to the cro ssroads and leave it.) Yes, I'll leave it right there, I'll leave it. (Then what? Then, what about it?) He' ll find it. St. Peter , he' ll find that. (Then what will he do? ) Anything that I ask for I'll get - see, don't care what it is. [While my machine was turned off, informant began a candle rite.] (Burn a candle to him and ask for that from St . Peter?) Yes , after you -take a frog, get ah olt of tim -ev'ry momin' take a broom and whup ' im , call ' im all kind of name an ' whup 'im out the world till he [St. Peter? come up?] an' he 'll [St. Peter will] answer you an ' ask wh ut you want 'im to do . [Here , a well-known rite of whipping a frog is confusing - I return to the letter. ] (Now , wait a minute - ab out this crossroad business . What would you say in that letter you would write?) Well, you would say, \"Well, St. Peter, I want this woman do such and so. I want you to give me this and I want this done, and harm this certain fellow and move that man out of my way,\" or something like that. \"I want you to do it.\" (And after you write this letter , do you have to go before St. Peter's picture to do anything?) No , you have to have him on yo ur wall -have him on your wall to do that [ letter at crossroad]. Keep him on your wall. Just keep him on your wa ll or highb oy or· bureau, or over in front of your door. (Do you have to talk to St. Peter or anything before you write that letter?) • Well, if you talk to him once, he tell you what to do . Then, get your blood and write him [a] letter with your blood. Put it up on the wall of - up over the door and he'll answer . He'll do anything you say. (I see. Well now, how do you work this up on the wall -in putting this picture on the wall what do you do to it?) Well, you get you a broom and just wham him out, just call him all kinds of names. \"I asked you to do something and you didn't do it.\" Jus t whup him with that broom and he 'll do it .

He's for money - just like you ain't got no money, don't know where to get none. Well, you get down on your knees and you pray , you repeat them prayers -it's a prayer, you repeat them pr ayers nine times . [Does the prayer come wrapped about the candle?] (Each day?) Yes , sir. Well, after you repeats them prayers , you take you a green candle and you set it to St. Raymond and you make your wish, and you can ask him for anything you want, but you means it from your heart though and you'll get it. [New Orleans, La. , (783), 1086 :10.] 3043. Have a cerem ony . But in case that you get an altar you have to take it to the pries t and let him bless the altar before you bring it in your house.

[New Orleans, La. , (855) , 1349:3.] 3044. Well, St. Raymond , he is a good saint. St. Raymond is the saint for the poor. St. Raymond will give you bread and if you got children , he will keep the way open that you should feed your children . Now, you give St. Raymond a green light. You give him a green light at home. Of course, when you go to church , you gi ve him those little cup candles and they're yellow. Or you can set what you call a nine-day �ight. It's a little glass lamp with a globe on it. (A nine-day light.) But you gotta pay 25 cents for that nine-day light, and if you care to when th e nine days is up , light an other one . It is just the same. St. Raymond always keeps you with your preferment. He is a s aint that will help you. (You get these nine-day lights in the church?) In the church. (And y ou burn them there or at home?) In the church you burn th em first. [New Orleans, La ., (855), 1349:2.] 3045. (Before prohibition you did that?) Before prohibition came here, yes sir.

Well, St. Rita, the reason why she don't like men is -according to Scrip tures from what I'm got the understanding of -she never did like mens for one simple reason, on account of Christ, s ee. Christ is supposed to be her father, and he's not , see. She don't like men, she never did . When Christ was born, she looked and see that it was man. She walked away and they made her come back .

Generally , if the w�man go to her and ask her to do these favors, she can have it done ; but she'll have to go and go until she fulfill a promise she make to the s aint. It just like you, if I tell you , \"Loan me a ten-dollar bill today and I pay you back Saturday.\" Well , t hen Sat­urday come, y ou looking for your ten dollars, see. Well , that's how that is with this s.aint . You go to these saints and you ask 'em for a favor, just like , say for instance, you are out of work and you want a job, she 'll open the way for you to get the job. Well , you promise to give her flowers or promise to give her a quarter or half a dollar , maybe you promise to give her a candle . Well, s he'll open the way for y ou to get the job, but when you get the job, it ' s up to you to go and give her that candle or flower or whatsomever you promised her .

And I just felt that way, first trouble he had been in , and it worried me very much, and I carried him every meal and I just put it there in his handkerchief. I had it in his handkerchief and told him to use the handkerchief, and I say, \"Don' t wash it no matter h ow dirty it get and use it just as I said.\" (Well when you took these meals there, did they let you take this handkerchief wh ere he was?) No , no , Mr . Robert would t ake them hisself . (Then you gave Mr . Robert this note to give to your son?) It was in the handkerchief in the basket. I had a little basket you know and the food. Course he would go through the basket to see w as they an ything in there, but he didn't see anyth ing, you know , that would harm. Well , I just had on the note for him not to wash it no matter how dirty it gets. Well, I guess he seed that too but he didn't see nothing in there - just a white handkerchief -cause he just had one you know for h im to use. Well, which he did, but told it on that little note - because the handkerchief was dressed, you see .

I told him to keep this handkerchief and don't wet it whatever you do. Don't wet it no matter how dirty it gets - don't you wash it. And that 's what he did.

He 'd been always a peculiar child anyhow and seemed like he's easy to ketch on things . And it seems that some people is borned with something in 'em, �, and t hat's the way he is . Since he 'd gone to Philadelphia and all, he knowed so many tricks and turns you see, more than I does because I'm old enou gh to have a whole lot of experience you see. But he said he felt something wh en ah told him not to wet it and said he wouldn't wet it. And I told him to - ah sa y, \"When you get in court, you always wipe your mouth and nose with it.\" And he says he understood - s eemed like he felt like that's what it was and so I brought him on back as Doctor Armour says . And I asked him , I says , \"What in the world did you put in that handkerchief?\" He says that handkerchief was charged highly with lodestone and High John de Conker. He say that will bring anybody out of trouble -it will overcome any­thing . That's what he says. [For Berkley , see Introduction.] [Newport News , Va. , (482), 506 :8. ] 3069.

An' she put out some dirt, some kin 'a 100kin' -I called it sand. She poured out a little bottle, but she tole me it was graveyard dirt. So she mixed it all together.

So I named 'em down fer her. She told me , she said, \"Now, you take these names on this piece of paper, go to the northeast of this house an' bury it down there, then come back to me.\" Then she took that dirt, that mixture she had there, an' circle all the way aroun' my house entirely. [To circle the house with salt or other substances is a fairly common protective device.] An' told me then - she says, \"There somepin under your front doorstep tha ' joo an' your wife are wa1kin' over ev'ry day is what ca use you not to be gittin' along any better, an ' I'm gon'a stop it.

[Which house? ] Then [I] started to fallin' back [into the same bad luck] right away. I had a ole - sister's dead an' g one now.

Doator Buzzard came to see him and he had him to put both feet into a hot pan of water - all right , and let it got hot. And by taking his feet out de water , instead of washing dem , he jest take dem out de water and scrape 'em, both feet and - what he scrape from de water , de guy said , it looked like scales had come off his feet and practically other dirt.

Live things like most hoodoo disease can be moved down through the body and out through the feet. Sometimes the live thing will go out through the big toe, leaving a small hole to prove they exist. Since the present patient evidently picked up his live snake by walking over a snake preparation - dust or dried blood - the logical procedure was to scrape the bottoms of the patient's feet, using only the left or evil-side skin. Our operator could easily have pulled the live snake out through the left foot; instead he unfolds the towel and there is the small crawling snake he had taken from his pocket and had palmed into the towel. This triak is not so simple as it sounds. It demands a master of preparation and execution. Whoever this Doator Buzzard was , he was also an original thinker.

So he called on a man by the name of George Jackson who lived out here near Girdletree [MarylandJ at that time -he' s dead now. [George Jackson never lived at Girdletree.] And he went to call on this old man George Jackson . And he went to get some reots out of the woods and boiled it up. And while he was boiling these up he was singing a song. And the more he'd sing, the more this stuff would boil. I suppose that was just [uncle's] imagination.

And finally , when he drank this up , an hour or so afterwards, why these things came from him - he discharged these things. And they were wood­bitches - ground puppies . [For another example of singing while something boils , see 918, p.337.] This happened down here at St. James [a Negro community in which I was to work a few days later].

An' ah drew about, I think it was 700 and some dollars fer dat finger - where ah was working from. An' ah went over tuh Birmingham and got aroun' , having money you know -having a big time and met several girl friends.

Dey takes out fer de rent and fer de doctor bill. Well, ah went over to de hospital - to de little hospital and me being in de hospital , de doctor test mah eyes and everything and tole me ah had sore eyes. He tole me to bath mah eye with some saltwater and it would come all right. Well , ah did and it didn' t git any better and ah went back to him and so he sent me over to de Hillman Hospital - dat's in Birmingham -� specialist. Well, de specialist test mah eyes and ask me wh at happen . What hit me in de eye - did any steel or anything hit mah eye . Ah tole him no , it wasn't any steel or anything ah got in mah ey e.

An' so ah goes on back to mah cousin and tole him he tole me to go to a two-headed doctor, and ast him did he mean that. (Where did you say you went?) From Birmingham - from de hospital? Well, ah went back home , yo' see. (No. Didn't you go to see the two-headed doctor?) He tole me go to a two-headed doctor an' ah went. Ah goes back home fer [first] an' ah tell mah cousin, who ah was livin' with, wh at de doctor tole me . So he advised me to go to a place dey call Tennysville , see. Yes , dat's a suburb of Birmingham, ah guess, 'bout seven miles . So ah goes ovah to the lady - it's a colored lady. Her name was Madam Jane . Ah goes tuh her and so she comes in to de room - de waitin ' room and tole me everything . In de beginnin' she tole me , say , \"Well , yo ' lost yore eyesight -jist ab out .\" An' she tole me wh at it's all ab out and how come dis woman's mad with me and everything , but she wouldn 't tell me who the girl was - she wouldn't call her name but she would describe her to me and give de girl initials [see 2748, p.757] , yo' understand. An' so she tole me what charge -it cost me $25.00 to git mah eyes cured . Well, whut she said , ah don't know; but whut she tole me to do , ah know. So she advised me to bathe mah eyes in some fresh milk -whut ah mean by fresh milk , not dairy milk but from a cow, see . Dat whut she tole me to do - bathe mah eyes in fresh milk. An ' s he tole me dat mah eyes were blind from de girl takin' de bow off -de bow ah mean in de back of de hat, she had dressed de hat. An' say whut fer me tuh do was to take some salt -Epsom salts - take some Epsom salts and any kind of finest perfwne and j est bathe dis - where dis bow was in mah hat. See. Co 'se she gave me some treatments - remember whut she gave me was to rub cross mah eyes but whut it was, ah don't know. An' so ah guess she worked on me 'bout two weeks and ah gained mah eyesight. In facts, in the third week ah was stone blind . But whut she did -ah know whut she tole me to do. Dat was to cure mah eyes . Dat 's experience. (What happened to the girl?) Tuh de girl? Anything didn' t happen to her. Quite natural me an' her was still friends but ah was sort of shy of her because she had did that trick , yo ' see. In other words, she was tryin' tuh gain love, yo ' see. An' dis girl, she disliked her and she didn't want me to have dis girl.
