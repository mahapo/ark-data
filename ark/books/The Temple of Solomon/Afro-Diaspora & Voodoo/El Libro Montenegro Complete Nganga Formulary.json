The spirits come from the World of the Dead and manifest through the Nganga. The Nganga is usually constructed inside of a cast iron caldron or even inside of a clay pot. The Nganga is a miniature world and a doorway to the supernatural. The Nganga is the home of the Nkisi ( C ongo Spirit ) who rests inside waiting until summoned by its owner. The spirit can only manifest to its owner who has made an eter-nal pact with the World of the Spirits of Darkness that will last until the physical death of its owner. The purpose of the spirit is to serve and protect its master by any means necessary. In the World of the Congo Spirits, good and evil are looked upon equally and weighed the same. That is, there is no distinct classification between good and evil as the Western World believes. Where do these spirits come from and why are they here? There are spirits everywhere around us. Everything, location and thing found in this world and the cosmos contain some kind of spiri-tual energy and life force. There are pantheons of spiritual entities known as “restless spirits” that for some reason have not been able to pass through light dimensions and are trapped here inside of our world until they complete their task or their destiny. There are many different types of spiritual entities which exist and can be found in the mountains, forest, stones, trees, rivers, oceans and other far away loca-tions such as the planets and the stars. Spirits are pure unseen and invisible energy that can manifest in our physical world. Through the use of ancient magical necromancy incantations and ancient magical sorcery formulas and preparations an individual can tap into this energy and stabilize it by undergoing a series of initiations into this mysterious world which will allow them to walk with authority and respect in the realm of the spirits. In the African Congo religious tradition of spirituality, initiations and pacts with the spirits are achieved through a series of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 very ancient initiations that link the physical dimension which we live in with the outer dimension, where the spirits reside. These initiations were restricted to a hierarchy of select individuals who would honor the traditions, culture and customs of a proud African Congo people. When an individual undergoes the ancient initiation process these invisible spiritual entities will then recognize the new initiate as one of their own and in return will give the individual access to the secret “Cosmic Keys” to unlock the forbidden doors of the “Universal Occult Myster-ies”. The scientific study of how these invisible spirits manifest within our physical world through the use of ancient necromancy invocations is called “Occult Physics” . The science of “Occult Physics” is the study of an unknown or invisible matter and its motion through space time and all that derives from these, such as energy and force. More broadly, it is the general analysis of how these unseen invisible forces react in nature, conducted in order to understand how the world and universe behave. The techniques of how to capture spirits and to har-ness their strange and very powerful energy to do ones bidding is com-monplace in all ancient cultures but the method by which an individual accomplished this varies from culture to culture and from region to re-gion. In Western and European culture individuals initiated into the Spiritual Mysteries were many of times referred to as Witches, War-locks and Sorcerers. In the African Congo religious tradition they are known as Mayomberos. The word Mayombero refers to an individual who possesses great \"occult knowledge\" and supernatural power to talk and to command the spirits of the dead for a variety of reasons such as to heal individuals from disease, sickness, power and protection against the evil eye and entities more commonly known as demons. The prac-tice of working with the spirits of the dead is called necromancy. King Solomon, one of the greatest and most famous individuals of world bib-lical history was a sorcerer as well as a necromancer. After the African"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 Diaspora to the New World, these initiations remained almost intact with a few variations and some syncretism and the incorporation of indige-nous Indian and Christian elements. The following text is a historical documentation of some magical formulas and sacred rituals that link and connect the physical world with the sacred and the divine. It is a very strange world that modern day scientists acknowledge but have not been able to fully explain. This world can only be reached, ex-plained and experienced by direct initiation and participation. The fol-lowing ancient magical Nganga formulas were used by my Family of Brazil who practice \"Latin American Necromancy\" in a very powerful form of Afro-Congo religious tradition known as Quimbanda (VITITI CONGO BIZANGO) and Candomble De Congo Orixa religious tradi-tion. Quimbanda is a mixture of ancient European Necromancy, Congo religious traditions, indigenous native Indians from the Amazon Rain Forest, European Spiritism and the Jewish Kabbalistic Magical Angelic System. The formulas are also used in the Caribbean by practitioners from the Afro-Congo religious sect known as Palo Mayombe, Palo Monte, Vititi Kongo, Bizango, Obeah, Voudoun and Kimbisa. Although the nganga formulas will vary from region or country, they are all de-rived from the same tribes of the African Congo. “T he Quimbanda religious tradition is the most powerful Congo magi-cal practice found in the New World and is also known and revered as perhaps being the most feared, complicated and the powerful forms of black magic found in Latin America ”. The various forms of Congo religion found in the New World have adapted and have successfully incorporated and are composed of a vast pantheon of spiritual deities, spirits, angels and demons. The fol-lowing Congo initiation spirit formulas presented here in this book are fundamental base spiritual formulas. Over a period of time of working"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 with the spirits, they may request more items and ingredients that can be added at a later time. An experienced Mayombero Priest ( C aribbean ) or Quimbandeiro Priest ( Brazil ) will be able to deter-mine this at the time of preparing the Congo Spirits or before doing an initiation. Depending on the Congo religious tradition or mystic school that you belong to, the following formulas can be modified to fit your specific needs. All of the spirits presented here in this book can be found in many ancient cultures, but are known by other names and are venerated and magically manifested differently. The following Congo initiation formula is about how to prepare and present various magical paths of the Congo spirits. All of the following Latin American Necro-mancy Initiation rituals are authentic and will be discussed in detail about how to correctly perform these very delicate initiation rituals. De-pending on the Congo tradition that you belong to, it can be modified to fit your religious traditions specific needs. All of the formulas presented here in this book are real and authentic. My name is Carlos Antonio De Bourbon Galdiano Montenegro and I am a member of the famous Mon-tenegro Family originally from Eastern Europe who have been practitio-ners of the magical occult black arts for over 3500 years. In 1806, my family migrated to Brazil fleeing the French invasion of Napoleon Bona-parte of the Iberian Peninsula along with the Portuguese Royal Family. While living in Brazil, we became fascinated with the magical religious traditions of the Africans who were working on the Portuguese sugar cane and coffee plantations. In the year 1864, a black woman who worked on the Montenegro Family coffee plantation in the lush tropical mountains just outside of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil by the name of Paola Fernandes initiated Matilda Andrade De Bourbon-Montenegro into the Mysteries of the Congo Religion. In the 1920 ’s the Montenegro Family migrated to the United States of America and brought with them the sacred mysteries of the Congo religious tradition known as Vititi Congo"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 Bizango. In the 1920 ’s through the 1980 ’s, the \"Casa Montenegro\" was governed by the Montenegro Family Matriarch, Maria Miranda De Bourbon-Montenegro until her death at the age of 98. In 1986, Carlos Antonio De Bourbon-Montenegro inherited the hereditary position and became the Patriarch of the Casa Montenegro Spiritual Temple. In 2003, the Casa Montenegro Spiritual Temple was organized into the American Candomble Church to preserve the unique and historical Vititi Congo Bizango religious tradition and the Brazilian Orixa Mysteries that have been uniquely practiced by the Montenegro Family of Brazil and have survived successfully for more than 146 years. I am an experi-enced Mayombero ( Congo Religion Priest ) and Quimbandeiro who is recognized throughout the world for my writings about how to practice Congo and Orixa Religion, my magical formulas as well as my magical abilities. Over the past 25 or so years that I have been preparing sacred religious items for individuals and performing thousands of initiations for individuals into the Congo and Candomble De Congo Orixa Mysteries, I have developed this sacred African sorcery art form into a very fine sci-ence. This book was written for initiated members of the Congo religion and for other individuals who are considering receiving the Congo Mys-teries. By following the following rituals exactly how it is written here, you will see spectacular magical results. The following ancient magical formulas are so exact that even a scientist could follow the formulas that are presented here in this book in a laboratory and it would still work although initiation is still necessary if you want to have full com-mand over the spirits. As an experienced Tata and High Priest of the Congolese Religion, I believe that an individual must find a particular spiritual path and religious philosophy which is comfortable for you.

"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 INITIATIONS IN A TRADITIONAL CONGO MUNANZO All of the following ceremonies are important initiations that an individ-ual will undergo if they are considering becoming a part of a formal Congo religious temple. A Congo Religious Temple is called in Spanish “M UNANZO”. A Munanzo is a place of worship and where initiated individuals come together as a “family unit” to venerate the vast pan-theon of Congo Spiritual Deities. A Munanzo is a place where your jour-ney to the mystical supernatural world of the Congo Spirits begins. A Munanzo is a place of religious learning and also a place where magic begins and ends. If you are seeking initiation into the Congo religious Mysteries there are two things that you should know right now and be prepared for before beginning your spiritual journey. The first is that it requires a lot of time and personal dedication. When you become initiated it will require much of your time to be spent at your Congo Munanzo working with your Godfather if you want to learn. That means a lot of time away from your home, time away from your per-sonal relationships and time away from having fun. To complete the various steps and levels of Congo initiations could take many years. The second thing is that it will require a lot of money for your religious education. Remember, this religion can really only be learned and ex-perienced by direct initiation and participation. Each level of initiation requires that the individual give a donation fee (D erecho) to the Congo Temple. The Derecho is used to maintain the Congo Temple and to purchase the required ritual offerings which many times are ex-pensive for the spirits. If someone is charging you less than the follow-ing prices, more than likely you are getting \"ripped off\". The reason that the initiation ceremonies are so expensive is because of the complicity of each sacred ritual. As an experienced Tata of the Congo religion for many years, I can honestly tell you that I have seen and heard some"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 real \"horror stories\" and the cost to redo or repair something that wasn't done correct the first time may even cost you more money then what you paid for the first time. That is of course, if you can find someone who is willing to do it for you !!!. It is better to pay the real price to some-one who really knows what they are doing and to get it done right the first time. There are many other minor initiations associated with a Congo Munanzo but the following are the most important for an individ-ual to do. The Congo experience is a very beautiful thing and the spirits will reward you. Patience and personal sacrifice are key elements to successful learning at a traditional Congo Munanzo. - GUARANTEED - BAPTISM INTO THE QUIMBANDA SPIRIT MYSTERIES Although not common in the Caribbean tradition of Congo religious tra-dition, an individual desiring to become a member of a traditional Brazil-ian Orthodox Congo Quimbanda religious temple will be able to receive the divine protection of the powerful Quimbanda Spirits by receiving Baptism into the spiritual Quimbanda Mysteries. When an individual is baptized into the Quimbanda Spiritual Mysteries they are cleansed of all negativity and can then begin to continue with their spiritual journey into the Mysteries of the Spirits. It is through Baptism that the Congo spirits will begin to know the individual and their desired intent to become fully initiated at a traditional Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda temple. When an individual is baptized into the Quimbanda Spiritual Mysteries they are making a “pledge ” and not a “pact ” with the powerful deities. The entire ritual process takes three days. The individual who is baptized receives the powerful Quimbanda Spirit beads which are the “banners of our Quimbanda faith”. Baptism into the Quimbanda Spiritual Myster-ies cost between $3500 and $6500. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 AJE SPIRITS INITIATION CEREMONY The \"Aje Spirits Initiation Ceremony\" links our world to the invisible world of the Aje Spirits ( Witches ) . The Aje Spirits control all aspects of human life such as wealth, health, prosperity, and our \"spiritual birth destiny\". If an individual does not undergo this initiation ceremony they will always be plagued with constant spiritual attacks by the Aje Spirits. By undergoing this initiation ceremony, an individual makes spiritual peace and establishes a lifelong relationship with the powerful Aje Spir-its without any spiritual interference in order to be able to accomplish your desired goals in one’ s life. The Aje Spirits Initiation Ceremony cost between $3500 and $6500. EGGUN SPIRITS INITIATION CEREMONY The “Eggun Spirits Initiation Ceremony” links the new initiate to the world of their Ancestors. Without the permission, blessings and assis-tance of our Ancestors we will never be able to realize all of the good things that life holds for us. By undergoing this initiation an individual establishes a relationship with the world of the Ancestors so they will be better able to assist the individual with all the good things in life and to be able to overcome all difficulties that an individual may be faced with. It is important that a new initiate undergo this initiation ceremony so that they do not lose their way on their journey in this life. The Eggun Spirits Initiation Ceremony cost between $3500 to $6500. RAYADO INITIATION CEREMONY The “Rayado Initiation Ceremony” links the new initiate to the World of the Congo Spirits so that they will be better able to assist one with advancing in a positive direction in life. There are two parts of the Rayado Initiation Ceremony. The first \"Rayado Initiation Ceremony\" establishes a spiritual relationship between the Congo Spirits and the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33 new initiate. The second “Rayado Initiation Ceremony,\" which is tradi-tionally done 21 days after the first Rayado Initiation Ceremony gives the individual the ability to communicate and have command over the powerful Congo Deities. Both Rayado Initiation Ceremonies give an individual great protection against all harmful energy that may be affect-ing the individual or that may come their way. The Rayado Initiation Ceremony gives the individual the ability to leap over all obstacles of this life and will even protect an individual from untimely death. The Rayado Initiation Ceremony will make an individual invisible to any and all legal problems. The cost of each Rayado Initiation Ceremony is be-tween $3500 to $6500. This ceremony opens the third eye of the indi-vidual. It is only after doing these very important initiation ceremonies that an individual is fully accepted into the traditional Congo Munanzo Temple as a full- fledged member. The Rayado Initiation Ceremony can save your life. THE CONGO SPIRIT LUCERO INITIATION CEREMONY The “Congo Spirit Lucero Initiation Ceremony” is the first ritual in which the new initiate will receive the Mysteries of the actual “N kisi” spirit to work with. The Congo Spirit Lucero is the Divine Gate Keeper and without his assistance and permission all forms of spiritual commu-nication would be closed to the world of the Congo Spirits. The cost of this initiation is between $3500 to $6500. NGANGA INITIATION CEREMONY The “N ganga Initiation Ceremony” is one of the most important of all of the initiation ceremonies associated with a traditional Congo Munanzo.

MBELE INITAITION CEREMONY The “Mbele Initiation Ceremony” is a ritual which gives the new initi-ate the religious right to be able to sacrifice four legged animals to the Congo Spirits. This initiation ceremony also gives the initiate the right to be able to perform the Rayado initiation on other individuals desiring to enter into the Congo Mysteries. The cost of this initiation is between $9,000 to $18,000 depending on the Congo Munanzo in which you be-long to. CONGO SPIRIT OZAIN INITIATION CEREMONY The “Congo Spirit Ozain Initiation Ceremony” can only be received by men. This initiation ceremony gives the initiate the spiritual right to be able to work and invoke the powerful magical Mysteries of the Congo Spirit Ozain. The cost of this initiation is between $18,000 to $25,000. After the individual undergoes this very important initiation ceremony where they will receive the actual \"Spirit Mysteries\" of the Congo Spirit Ozain they are then referred to and called by the prestig-ious religious title “Ozainista ”.

The official title of the \"Bakunfula\" is the \"Sergeant At Arms\". The Bakunfula is responsible for maintaining internal order at the Congo Munanzo. The Bakunfula along with the Tata is responsible for making sure that all of the sacred rituals and ceremonies of a Congo Munanzo are done and followed correctly by all of its members. The Bakunfula is also the individual who administers punishments for religious laws ( Regla De Congo) violated by its members.

FORMAL CONGO MUNANZO PRACTITIONER Traditionally, belonging to a formally organized Congo Munanzo was the only way to learn the Congo religion. Thankfully that is no longer the case.

There's a lot of truth in this. If you truly want to join a formal Congo Munanzo, chances are you'll find one. Visit local New Age, Metaphysical or Occult stores and take classes on Brazilian mysticism or similar subjects offered through these centers. More than likely, these classes will be taught by a priest or priestess of Congo religion. At the very least, attending such classes will enable the student to meet others of like minds, which could be the basis for found-ing a new Formal Congo Munanzo or for finding contacts in established groups. In the end, only you can make the decision to be Solitary Congo Practitioner or to belong to a Formal Congo Munanzo.

It is however possible for an individual to practice the Congo religion without going through the long process of initiations by practicing it spiritually. Although the individual who is spiri-tually practicing Congo religion will never fully be able to realize the benefits of an initiate who is initiated they can do this quite effectively if you approach the spirits with respect . Many individuals ask me how can they practice spiritually the Congo religion without making a pact with the Congo Spiritual world and the answer is very simple. An indi-vidual desiring to work spiritually with the Congo spirits can do all of the following to start working with the spirits. 1. Construct a spiritual altar to the Aje Spirits. 2. Construct a spiritual altar to the Eggun Spirits 3. Construct a spiritual altar to the Congo Spirits 4. Construct a spiritual altar called a “Boveda Espiritual” On your altars you can place images, statues and any of the spirit sig-nature signs that correspond to a particular Congo Deity. Candles are very important and are also key spiritual elements as part of your spiri-tual Congo altar. If you will be invoking a particular Congo Deity you can simply draw the spirit signature on a piece of paper and then place the candle on top of it before you invoke them through the Congo Prayers. You can use any of the Congo Prayers in this book to realize your spiritual practice of Congo religion.

Like all of my other books, telling the truth and speaking out very candidly about the \"PROS\" and the \"CONS\" about the Congo religion, I will go right ahead and once again play the \"bad guy\" and break the news to you as simple and painless as possible. Remember, every story has a hero and a villain. I guess for this book as well as for all of my other books, I can be both. \"That is not a problem for me\". I am qualified to answer all of the following questions because I'am considered by \"Historians\" and \"World Scholars on African Religion and Occult Stud-ies\" as the \"Worlds Most Foremost Authority On Candomble, Macumba, Santeria And The Congo Religious Tradition, Sacred Ceremonies and Initiation Rites\". Over the past 25 or so years that I have been a practic-ing initiated High Priest (TATA) of the Congo religion as well as an initiated Orixa Priest of Brazilian Candomble, I have had the opportunity to have met many individuals from the Santeria & Palo Mayombe Com-munity who many of them have claimed to have been initiated or have some knowledge of how to practice the Congo religion correctly, but in reality they did not. Many of these individuals have defrauded innocent individuals of their time and money who had come to them to correctly learn the religious principles of the Congo religious tradition. I have also met many individuals who were initiated at a Congo Munanzo but were later deprived important knowledge and religious instruction because the High Priest of their Congo Temple did not want them to learn and therefore could keep these individuals under their foot so that the initi-ate would continue to give them their money.

The following section is for all those individuals who are seeking out initiation into a formal Congo Munanzo ( Temple ) . Although it is very short, these are just some of the questions and concerns that I have had to address in my 25 or so years as a practicing Palero Priest. I am sure that there are hundreds of more questions that one could ask and be answered. A very important question to ask yourself when seeking out initiation from a Congo Munanzo is the following: Do you want to be apart of a large Congo Munanzo or a small Congo Munanzo? I have been to many fancy Congo Munanzos that had all of the scary movie props that are only there to impress new initiates, but in fact the Tata from that Congo Temple really didn't know what he was really doing and didn't have any real magical ability at all. I have also been to Congo Munanzos that were very small and not very fancy, but the Tata knew a great deal about the Congo religion and about the principles of Congo magic. This decision is up to you, but one thing to remember is that fa-mous saying “not all that glitters is gold ”. Sometimes in smaller inde-pendent Congo Munanzos you will learn more because the Tata can devote more time to instruct you in the Congo magical tradition. The choice is up to you. If you like scary movies, pageantry and “Bling-Bling ” then choose some Congo Munanzo that is set up like a \"Universal Studios\" movie set.

BY TAKING YOUR TIME YOU WILL BE SAVING YOURSELF LOTS OF TIME, MONEY AND GRIEF. The following are answers to questions that you may have about joining a formal Congo Munanzo and about fees associated with the Congo Munanzo initiation process. The following fees are accurate and are current from New York City, Miami, Puerto Rico, New Orleans, Texas and to Los Angeles and “it is what it is”. If you are seeking initiation into the Congo religious Mysteries there are two things that you should know right now and be prepared for before beginning your spiritual jour-ney. The first is that it requires a lot of time and personal dedication. When you become initiated it will require much of your time to be spent at your Congo Munanzo working with your Godfather if you want to learn. That means a lot of time away from your home, time away from your per-sonal relationships and time away from having fun. To complete the various steps and levels of Congo initiations could take many years. The second thing is that it will require a lot of money for your religious education. Remember, this religion can really only be learned and ex-perienced by direct initiation and participation. Each level of initiation requires that the individual give a donation fee ( D erecho ) to the Congo Temple. The Derecho is used to maintain the temple and to pur-chase the required spiritual offerings which many times are expensive for the spirits. If someone is charging you less than the following prices, more than likely you are getting \"ripped off.\" As an experienced Tata of the Congo religion for many years I can tell you that I have seen and heard some real \"horror stories\" and the cost to redo or repair some-thing that wasn't done correct the first time may even cost you more money than you first paid. That is of course, if you can find someone"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58 who is willing to do it for you !!!. It is better to pay the real price to some-one who really knows what they are doing and and to get it done right the first time. Q: Why do I have to pay? A: If an individual does not pay, they will never really truly appreciate it. Here is some more reasons why; The initiations are costly because of the time and the magical ingredients are expensive and difficult to find. Another reason that you need to pay is because the money you pay for your initiation is used to maintain and run the Congo Temple which can be costly especially when purchasing items for the spirits to be used as spiritual offerings such as liquor, cigars, fruit, meat, live animals, honey and a lot more. Another reason is that when you join a temple it is like attending a university course where you will learn invaluable information that you will not be able to get anywhere else. Q: What is the spiritual order in which I should be expecting to receive my initiations in a formal Congo Munanzo? A: This is a very good controversial question. The spiritual order in which you will be receiving your initiations will vary from temple to tem-ple, but this is the spiritual order which makes more sense and really has good results for the new initiate. If you are considering joining a formal Congo Munanzo then you should ask the presiding Tata from that Congo Temple what is the spiritual order of initiations that they fol-low. If the Tata from that Temple can not openly tell you or explain to you the spiritual initiation process associated with their Temple, the spiritual philosophy, the spiritual theology, the history of their Congo religious tradition and the fees associated with their Temple, then you will be making a \"big mistake\" to get initiated there. Even though the process by which the initiations are performed are secret and may vary from Munanzo to Munanzo, they should not have any problem explain-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59 ing the order of the spiritual initiation process and the fees associated with the spiritual initiation process. The following order for spiritual initia-tions is from the Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda Vititi Congo Bizango religious tradition. This is the spiritual initiation order that we practice at our formal Congo Munanzo. Over the past 25 or so years that I have been initiating individuals into the \"Congo Mysteries,\" I have found out that if a new initiate does not follow the spiritual order of initiations as outlined below they will definitely and most certainly have spiritual prob-lems after they become initiated. That is why in many cases, instead of the new initiate's life becoming better it just seems to get worse and even more spiritually complicated. The reason that the life of the new initiate became worse is because they are out of \"spiritual order\" and therefore their constant misfortune or bad luck many of times is not be-ing caused by witchcraft attacks from their enemies, but is really coming from the same spiritual entities which they originally made a pact with because they did not follow the spiritual initiation order that the spirits have ordained to mankind through the cosmic spiritual rules of the \"Regla De Congo\". That means, the following spiritual initiation order is authentic and is the original spiritual initiation order as practiced in the African Congo by Congo religious practitioners in the practice of \"Regla De Congo\". If you follow the spiritual initiation order below you will see spectacular spiritual results. The order of spiritual initiations by which they should be received are as follows; the Mysteries of the Aje Spirits Initiation Ceremony, the Mysteries of the Eggun Spirits Initiation Cere-mony, the Mysteries of the Rayado Initiation Ceremony, the Mysteries of the Congo Spirit Lucero Initiation Ceremony, the Mysteries of the Nganga Spirit Initiation Ceremony, the Mysteries of the Mbele Initiation Ceremony, the Mysteries of the Congo Spirit Ozain Initiation Ceremony, the Mysteries of the Bakunfula Initiation Ceremony, and the Mysteries of the Tata Malongo Initiation Ceremony. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 By following the above spiritual initiation order you will be assured that each of the spiritual entities ( AJE SPIRITS & EGGUN SPIRITS ) and-Congo Spirits are spiritually appeased and organized in a comprehend-ible spiritual order that is both agreeable with an individual's Spirit Guides, Congo Spirits and the new initiate. If you are a Tata presiding over a formal Congo Munanzo, I would recommend that you restructure your Congo Temple, if you want to see better spiritual results for your new initiates and for it's current members. Q: How much does it cost to become initiated into the Congo religious Mysteries ( El Rayado ) ? A: The cost may vary from temple to temple but it normally runs about $7,000 to $13,000 for the entire two part Rayado ceremony. If you are paying anything less than that, you either caught the spirits on a “good day ” or the Rayado Ceremony is completely \"bogus\" and maybe not be legitimate or may not have been done correctly. Good deals are usu-ally what they are, \"just a good deal\" and nothing more. Q: How many initiations are there to do & what is the cost? A: There are about ( 9 ) \"Major Initiations\" that are associated with a formal Congo Munanzo. There are however many minor spiritual initia-tions that a new initiate can receive. These minor initiations all fall within the categories of the ( 9 ) Major Initiations. If you are going to join and become an active member of a formal Congo Munanzo you will have to receive at least ( 4 ) of these Major Initiations which are sacred Congo Mysteries of the: AJE SPIRITS INITIATION CEREMONY, EGGUN INI-TIATION CEREMONY, RAYADO INITIATION CEREMONY & THE SPIRIT LUCERO INITIATION CEREMONY. A: The cost to receive the initiation of the Congo Spirit Lucero is be-tween $3500 to $6500. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 A: The cost to receive the initiation of the Nganga and to receive the Congo Mysteries of the actual spirit caldron can run between $18,000 to $35,000. if you are paying anything less than that price for a standard size Nganga, more than likely you have been taken for your money or maybe just only received a very weak and incomplete Nkisi Spirit or even just an iron caldron that looks like an Spirit Nganga but it really is just another \"movie prop from Universal Studios\" and although it looks good, it doesn't have anything spiritually inside worth talking about. The reason for such a high cost is that the material to really construct a real working spirit is costly and many times the items are very scare and difficult to find. Remember, if it were really that simple and cheap to construct an authentic Congo Spirit Nganga by someone who really knows what their doing and that the Congo Spirit actually works, there would be no need for automobiles anymore because everyone would be flying on brooms. \"You know what I ’am saying,\" right? Q: I recently paid money to a Palero Priest in Los Angeles to prepare a Zarabanda Spirit Nganga for me. I gave him my cash money, ( $ 8,500 ) on a Friday afternoon and then he told me to come back and to pick it ( the Nganga ) up at his Botanica on the following Mon-day afternoon. That seems really fast ( 3 Days ) for him to prepare my Zarabanda Spirit Nganga. How long does it really take to prepare the actual Congo Mysteries of any of the Spirit Ngangas or is this normal ? A: No. This is far from being normal. If you gave someone your \"hard earned cash money\" to prepare for you the authentic Congo Mysteries of the Spirit Nganga and it took less than 21 days from the time that you gave him the money, \"you have been ripped off\". The real truth behind preparing a Spirit Nganga may take several weeks to be able to gather up together all of the sacred ingredients necessary to prepare an au-thentic Spirit Nganga. The reason for this is that there are many magi-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 cal rituals and sacred ceremonies that must be done first and even dur-ing the sacred making process and before presenting the Spirit Nganga to the new initiate. When the Palero Priest is preparing the Spirit Nganga for the new initiate they will also have to do many rituals while making the Spirit Nganga to ensure the magical success of the new spirit for the new initiate. After the Palero Priest has completed making the Spirit Nganga it then takes at least another 21 days of rituals and ceremonies to give spiritual birth to the new Spirit ( N k isi ) Nganga. Remember that traditionally all Congo Spirit Ngangas are required to be buried under the ground and then unearthed 21 days later before they can be presented to the new initiate. So if you paid your cash money\" to some Palero Priest and it took them only a few days for him to do so and then he told you to come and pick it up, you most certainly were \"ripped right off.\" This is a very common practice by Palero Priests working in the Los Angeles area. Even though the Mysteries of the Spirit Nganga contained in the iron caldron may look authentic, it is not. I have prepared 1000's of Spirit Ngangas in my 35 years as an experi-enced Palero Priest and I can honestly tell you that it really takes many hours and days to correctly prepare an authentic Spirit Nganga that ac-tual works. If you are desiring to have a Congo Spirit Nganga prepared for you, make sure that the Congo Priest knows what he is doing and doesn't \"cut\" any corners to just \"make a buck.\" After you receive your Spirit Nganga it needs to be given a religious ceremony at the new initi-ates residence called \"La Entrada\", to welcome the new spirit into its new home. If the Palero Priest that you received your Spirit Nganga initiation Ceremony did not give the \"La Entrada\" ceremony at the new initiates residence, the ceremony was not done correctly and your new Congo Spirit Nganga will be unwilling to work for the new initiate in a positive manner even causing problems for the new initiate. The cost of the \"La Entrada\" Ceremony should be included in the cost of the Congo"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 Spirit Nganga Initiation Ceremony. This ceremony must be done with-out any delay once you bring your new Congo Spirit Nganga to your residence. If you gave the Palero Priest \"cash money\" and your Nganga wasn't prepared correctly, you can \"kiss your money good bye\". Q: I received my Congo Spirit Nganga, but the Palero Priest that made it for me never buried it in the ground before presenting it to me. Is this an important spiritual aspect of the Congo Spirit Nganga Initiation Cere-mony or can it be left out? A: All practitioners of authentic Congo religion bury the completed Congo Spirits Nganga for a minimum of at least a 21 day period of time before it can be correctly presented to the new initiate. If your Nganga was not buried, it is missing one of the key spiritual elements that is necessary to give birth to the Mysteries of the new Congo Spirit from their World to our World. By overlooking this very important spiritual key element of receiving the Congo Spirits Nganga ceremony it will not be fully charged with the magical powers to assist you effectively. So the answer is no, because it is an important spiritual aspect to the initiation ceremony that can not be left out. If you received your Congo Spirit Nganga in this manner without having been buried for at least 21 days, you got \"ripped off\" and the Tata did not really know what he was doing. A: The cost to receive the Eggun Spirits ( Ancestor Spirits ) and initia-tion is between $3500 to $6500. A: The cost to receive the initiation of Ozain is between $18,000 to $25,000. A: The cost to receive the initiation of the Bakunfula is between $18,000 to $25,000 A. The cost to receive the Mbele initiation is between $9,000 to $18,000.Q: Can you practice Congo religion without incurring the extra"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 expense of the initiation ceremonies? A: Yes. You can, although your access to actively participate in ritual ceremonies will be greatly diminished. You can also practice this pow-erful form of magical practice spiritually and by constructing a simple spiritual altar for your Ancestor Spirits and your Spirit Guides. Q: Are there any other initiations that I may have to receive in the future that are not part of the Congo Munanzo such as receiving the Mysteries of the Orixas? A: Yes & No. Congo Munanzos are traditionally independent from any other African religion found in the Caribbean. Meaning, that there are some Congo Temples that have noting to do with anything Orixa at all. That would depend upon the particular Congo Munanzo and the tradi-tion of that Temple. There are of course other Temples that also prac-tice the Orixa religious tradition as well and usually members initiated in the Mysteries of the Congo Temple will eventually find themselves crossing over into the Orixa Mysteries for whatever reason. To receive the complete Mysteries and the initiation of the Orixas is between $18,000 to $35,000 depending on the particular \"Saint\" which the initi-ate will be receiving. The initiation process takes seven days to com-plete in the Caribbean Santeria Orixa practice and ( 2 1 ) days in the Brazilian Candomble Orixa practice. An example of this would be my Families Congo Munanzo. We believe that the individual must enter into four independent traditions and Mysteries in order for the individual to be fully spiritually complete and spiritually balanced. The balance of light and darkness. This is the order in which we follow: Aje Mysteries, Eggun Mysteries, Congo Mysteries and lastly the Orixa Mysteries. Be-cause we are a Brazilian Congo Temple, our Congo Mysteries are called “Quimbanda” and our particular path of Orixa tradition is called \"Candomble\". In order for an individual to complete all of these sacred"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 Mysteries is a very long process and will take many years to complete to fully master all of the religious principals of the Congo tradition. Al-though we follow this particular spiritual path we also acknowledge that each one of these ( 4 ) separate spiritual traditions are independent of each other and therefore during initiation rituals and ceremonies the ( 4 ) will never cross by mixing them up. In order for this process to safely take place the Tata of the particular Congo Temple must be fully initiated into all if these Mysteries and have a complete command and knowledge on how to do so. Our particular Congo Munanzo completes its 146th year Anniversary as it was founded on May 1, 1864 in Brazil. The Congo Religious Tradition that we follow is called Vititi Congo Bi-zango. So as you can see, there are many different religious points of view although really all of them basically are the same, but just a little variation. Q: What if I have already been scratched in another Congo Temple, but want to leave? A: The first thing is that you must first follow all of the rules of your par-ticular Congo Temple in regards to leaving and give the spirits the ap-propriate spiritual offerings. If you don ’t do things correctly, then why would you expect things to go correctly in your own life. The Congo re-ligion is a belief of honor, honesty and pride. If you want to leave your Congo Temple, just be honest with the Tata who initiated you and tell him the reason why. The Tata is only the mouth piece and the facilitator for the Congo Spirits and he really is a neutral party to everything that happens at the Congo Temple. By leaving secretly or even in \"bad terms\" you break the original spiritual oath that you have made with the spirits. By leaving on \"bad terms\" or by not following the specific cere-monial procedure as outlined in “R egla De Congo” the rules of Congo religion you will be viewed by the Congo Spirits as a liar and"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 being dishonest. Even if you go to another temple the Congo Spirits will never look at you the same way nor assist you the same because they wont believe you. So just do things correct and you will be okay. Just because you have been scratched in another temple does not give you access to attend ceremonies at any other Congo Temple or Munanzo. Infact, if you are thinking about joining another temple and you have been Rayado already, you must undergo the entire process again in that new particular Munanzo. There is no “Carte Blanche ” on this question. SORRY. Q: I have received my Rayado initiations and I am an active member of a formal Congo Munanzo. Can I attend the religious ceremonies at an-other Congo Temple or Orixa Temple with one of my friends or family members who is initiated at the other temple and has invited me to at-tend a Spiritual Festival, Tambor, Misa Espiritual or Congo religious celebration?: NO. Remember that you chose to be initiated at your par-ticular Congo Munanzo. Each Congo Munanzo has a \"code of religious secrecy\" that you agreed to when you were initiated into the Congo Spirit Mysteries. Instead of going \"Munanzo Party Hopping,\" attend to the Congo Spirits from your own Munanzo. If the Congo Spirits are strengthen through rituals and prayers then you will also receive many other spiritual benefits and blessings. \"Who cares what they are doing down the street at some other Congo Munanzo.\" You should pay atten-tion to your own Congo Munanzo, if you really want to learn. Remember that all those \"nice people\" from down the street from that \"other\" Congo Munanzo may be your friend today and smile in your face, but they could also be your worst spiritual enemy tomorrow and stab you right in the back. \"Don't get caught up in the Mix.\" \"The road to hell has been paved with nice people\". Think about it. Stay focused and be a loyal devotee to your Congo Munanzo, the Congo Spirits, your Tata and to your \"Brothers\" and \"Sisters\" of your Temple. That is why an individ-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 ual seeking initiation into a formal Congo Temple should think about it before joining and becoming spiritually tied to it by becoming initiated there. It is important to find the right Congo or Orixa Temple that is both spiritually and socially correct for you. Q: I'am a Tata presiding over a formal Congo Munanzo. If an individual comes from another Munanzo, do I have an obligation to inform the other Tata? A: NO. It is the responsibility of the particular individual. The individual should know the spiritual consequences. If they don’ t, you should in-form them of what to do. By doing this, you will avoid future problems with other Congo Munanzos and all of the Tatas out there known what I mean, so I don ’t have to go into any detail about \"spiritual war\". If the individual doesn't do the correct thing by observing and following the \"Regla De Congo\", then really what would make you believe that they would not do it to you. On the other side of the coin, if you are an indi-vidual leaving on \"bad terms\" with your temple and seeking initiation into another temple, if the Tata at the new Congo temple does not ad-vise you what to do spiritually correctly then really you should take a look at the character of this individual ( TATA ) . If this Tata is trying to persuade you to join their particular temple and is “bad mouthing ” the other Tata and the Congo Munanzo that you were born in, then more than likely this individual is just after your money and they themselves really don't know anything about the real Congo religious tradition or even \"Regla De Congo\". If the new Tata does not advise you in a re-sponsible manner about what to do when you want to leave your former Congo temple then this Tata would not even think twice about \"taking your money and afterwards just push you to the side and to the curb\". Remember once again that “not all that glitters is gold”. At any rate, the Congo religion is a very \"hot spiritual energy force\" so if you can ’t"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 stand the heat, don ’t even get initiated. “GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN BECAUSE THE STOVE IS TOO HOT ”. So if you are one of those individuals who has left your temple on bad terms, you need to do the right thing. YAYA ’s ( Ladies ) this also applies to you.Q: What if an individual who is an “independent spiritual contractor ” comes to your Congo Munanzo and only wants to receive an initiation from you, but does not want to be apart of any particular group or your Munanzo? First of all, what is an independent spiritual contractor? An individual who I term independent spiritual contractor is somebody who is on their own individual spiritual quest and goes from Temple to Temple receiv-ing initiations here and there to complete their spiritual mission. A: If the individual is identified as being an \"independent spiritual con-tractor\" then you must decide what you will do on your own. Independ-ent spiritual contractors should not be allowed to participate in the groups inner most secret ceremonies or rituals. Independent spiritual contractors should be given what they need and then sent on their way. Over my many years of participation in this religion, I have met many independent spiritual contractors. Some of them I assisted and some I didn't. That choice is up to you. It is my experience that you should never think that this individual will be loyal to your Congo Munanzo, so be \"very cautious\". An independent spiritual contractor is exactly what it is. This individual is on their own \"team\". \"Don't expect them to be a team player.\" Q: How should I treat the “ Padrino ” of my Tata. A: Well this is a very simple question to answer. The individual who initi-ated your Tata is also your Spiritual Grandfather. As you know once you join a Congo Munanzo the members are seen as one big happy family or extended family. So the answer is treat the individual with great respect even though they may not participate in ceremonies at"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69 your Congo Munanzo. Respect is very important in the Congo religion. There is a Spanish saying in the Congo religion “ un perro no come un perro”. A dog does not eat another dog ” so that means even though your Tata may have problems with his/her Padrino or Madrino, stay out of that mess. In the Congo religion there is a sacred order of honor and respect which should always be observed and that sacred cosmic order is the following: God, The Ancestors, Mother & Father, Parents & Chil-dren, Brother & Sister. If you disrespect your Godfather, Grandmother or Grandfather you are in violation of this cosmic heavenly order and nothing good will come to you. - Guaranteed - Q: What if my Tata has a problem with his Godfather and asks me to participate in a ritual of black magic attack against his Godfather? A: Absolutely not. remember once you join a Congo Munanzo, you be-come apart of an extended spiritual family that we believe is linked spiri-tually through our blood that you voluntarily and willingly offered to the Congo Spirits in exchange for their spiritual protection at the time that you were initiated \"scratched.\" By participating in a spiritual attack against your brothers and sisters or other members such as you Pa-drino or your Tata you are really doing it to yourself. When you send out the Congo Spirits to attack someone that comes from your same spiri-tual family bloodline, they travel to the individual by smell. So if you are of the same spiritual bloodline and you send out the spirits to attack one of your own, how long will it be before those same spirits bummer rang back to you and kick you in the ass. \"I would say very fast\". So if you are at spiritual war with other members with your Congo Munanzo, think twice. It would be my advice for you to let them be. Remember, if some-one attacks you from your own spiritual bloodline they are in violation of their original oath to the spirits when they join your particular spiritual Congo Munanzo. The spirits are very smart, so let the spirits do the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 punishing and let this individual hang themselves with the rope of their own noose. At any rate, if you attack first any spiritual family member just be prepared for the worst and don ’t blame this member when your luck runs out. \"The same spirits that you originally made a pact with usually are to blame and not the other individual\". The spirits are just doing their job to maintain the celestial spiritual order and honor. You must always remember that when you take the oath of the Rayado ini-tiation ceremony, you are “s wearing on your life and also swearing on your blood”. What does that mean? That means not only are you swearing on your own blood, but you are spiritually in terms also \"swearing\" on the blood of your other “real bloodline related family members”. So if you do something against your Tata, your Tata ’s Godparents or even to your Brothers and Sisters from your Munanzo, please be aware that when the Congo Spirits punish a member for vio-lating their oath, often times the spirits will hit a member of your real bloodline related family. If you have children or other members of your family who are not initiated ( Rayado ) , you better think about it. Eve-rything that I just talked about also applies to Godchildren who have a problem with their Godparents. Sometimes it is better just to let dead dogs lie and move on without risking any type of spiritual punishment from the spirits that you originally made an oath to. The reason that I have talked about this very extensively is to warn you before seeking initiation into a temple without first seriously thinking about the spiritual consequences and risks involved. Q: How should I dress in the Congo temple when participating in ritu-als? A: Everyone should always be dressed in white cotton cloths to symbol-ize the simplicity of our ancestor's past. White also symbolizes purity and light. Women should always wear pants underneath a skirt. Why?"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71 Because this religion is a \"masculine hot spiritual energy\" and the spirits are warriors and therefore when you are in front of the spirits you must be masculine at all times. Everybody should also have their heads cov-ered with a white cloth bandana or a white hat. Wearing the initiation beads of the Congo Spirits is also appropriate. SEXUALITY & MORALITY IN A CONGO TEMPLE This is a very important topic which I feel is worthy of writing about. The first thing that I want to say is a Congo Munanzo is a place of worship and a place of God, therefore leave your lusty thoughts outside and come to the Temple clean in Mind, Body and Soul. If you have sexually relations before attending a ceremony at the Congo Munanzo, please wash yourself and take a \"Spiritual Bath\" before coming to the cere-mony. At any rate, all members should purify themselves with an Spiri-tual Omiero Herbal Bath before participating in any ritual or ceremony held at the Congo Munanzo. \"THE CONGO MUNANZO IS NOT A PICK UP PLACE NOR IS IT A BROTHEL.\" If you are joining a Congo temple to \"hook up\" or to meet other individuals for sex and romance, it is not the place. Even if you meet someone there that may be your soul mate, every Congo Temple has its own strict regulations about engaging in Temple relationships If you meet someone at the Congo temple for ro-mance, it should be only if you think the relationship will lead to a poten-tial marriage. A consultation with the Tata of the Munanzo is advised to first see if the spirits approve or disapprove. MEN AND WOMEN, THE CONGO TEMPLE IS NOT A SINGLES BAR. Men and women, if you want to do that, it would be better and a lot cheaper for you to join a “ SWINGER ’S CLUB ”. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 CAN I RECEIVE MY RAYADO FROM A WOMAN? This is a very good controversial topic. The answer is the following. The Congo religion is a very hot and masculine spiritual force which recog-nizes the important ritual role of both women and men as important parts of the Congo Munanzo. Both men and women have their religious roles defined within the particular Congo temple from which gave birth to their religious tradition. Although women have been known to give out Rayados, this is usually the role of a man. If the Yaya ( F emale Congo Priestess ) gives out a Rayado, the woman must be completely finished with having a monthly menstrual cycle. That means that the women's monthly menstrual cycle has completely disappeared and will not come back. The reason is that when she approaches the spirits to perform an initiation ritual she must always approach the spirits from the energy of a male. In our Congo temple we do not permit nor grant women the religious right to be able to perform any type of Rayado Ini-tiation Ceremony ritual at all, thus avoiding any types of spiritual prob-lems. If you are a new initiate, I would advise you to not receive your Rayado or any type of initiation except for maybe the Aje Spirits Initia-tion Ceremony or the Eggun Spirits Initiation Ceremony from a woman. This is not a biased opinion, it is just tradition \"Regla De Congo\". It has been my experience that many individuals who received the Rayado from a woman is just not the same as it would be from a man and the Rayado does not seem to protect an individual from danger as well as it would if the new initiate received it from a man. Many times individuals receiving Rayado Initiations from women have had to have it done again by a qualified \"TATA\" to “quita maldicion“ to get rid of the bad vibration that follows the new initiate after they receive a Rayado from a women who may still be menstruating. For all those individuals who have received a Rayado Initiation Ceremony from a women, I am sorry to inform you of this fact and perhaps that may be the reason why after"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73 receiving your Rayado Initiation Ceremony that instead of things getting better for you it just got worse. Ladies you know that I have always been a very vocal, liberal and controversial force in my writings in both Palo Mayombe and in the Santeria Community, so I don ’t want to of-fend anybody, but really ladies \"it is what it is.\" At any rate, your role ( w omen ) in the Congo Temple is very important and you already have many other specific types of religious tasks to do that usually only women should be doing. Remember, this is a Congo religion and not the Orixa religion. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE - SO THE ANSWER IS NO !!! - Q:- Can a Congo Priestess ( YAYA ) prepare a Congo Spirit Nganga and a Congo Spirit Lucero or the Spirit Exu for me? A: \"ABSOLUTELY NOT\". In traditional Brazilian Orthodox Congo Relig-ion ( R egla De Congo ) and traditional Caribbean Congo Religion, women do not have the religious right to really prepare any of the major Congo Spirit Initiation Ceremonies with the exception of the Aje Spirits Initiation and the Eggun Spirits Initiation Ceremony. If you have re-ceived your Congo Spirit Nganga or Spirit Lucero from a women you better \"check it out\". Why wait for problems to come your way when you already know that it is an accident just waiting to happen. Its not the question of will it happen, its a question of when will it happen? Don't take any spiritual chances, get rid of it and have a qualified and experi-enced Congo Priest ( T ATA ) prepare the spirits for you again in the correct traditional Congo Religious manner. Q: What is the difference between SANTERIA & CANDOMBLE? A: Santeria is the Orixa religion as found and practiced in the Carib-bean. Candomble is the Orixa religion as found and practiced in Brazil. Q: Which of the two Orixa religious traditions are more powerful? "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 A: I am initiated in both the Caribbean Orixa religion as well as the Bra-zilian Orixa religious tradition and I have found that the Brazilian Orixa Mysteries are more powerful, authentic and actually do work very fast and have very good magical results. The Orixa religion as found and practiced in the Caribbean has in \"recent years\" developed many ele-ments of \"fraud\" and \"trickery\" within it and many individuals who were initiated into the Caribbean Orixa Mysteries are now seeking out spiri-tual assistance and guidance from Brazilian Orixa Priests to correct what was done wrong during their initiations. You have to remember that Santeria as found and formally practiced by believers in the New World is only just a little more than 100 years of age as opposed to the Brazilian Orixa religious tradition which has been around and practiced with proven success since the early 1500's. The ultimate problem or blame for why the Orixa religion as found and practiced in the Carib-bean is what I consider \"spiritually contaminated\" is not in the powerful Orixas themselves, but the blame lies with the individuals who are con-ferring their ( Orixa ) Mysteries to other individuals and who them-selves ( Santero Priests ) are lacking the appropriate spiritual instruc-tion and a basic educational and spiritual background to effectively do so with success. \"With something so important and costly as an initiation why would you take a chance to have it done wrong or even incorrectly\". \"The choice is up to you\". \"Just because everybody is doing it doesn't mean you should too\". \"Sometimes what appears to be good and legitimate may often times just be a large organized group of \"CONMEN\" just waiting to take your money by fleecing the unsuspecting sheep\". If everybody was jumping off a cliff, would you do it to? I hope you answered \"NO\" to this question. Q: What is the difference between Caribbean Palo Mayombe & Brazil-"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75 ian Quimbanda?: The Congo religious tradition as found and practiced in the Caribbean is known as Palo Mayombe. The Congo religious tra-dition as found and practiced in Brazil is known as Quimbanda. Both religious traditions are derived from Congo tribes of African peoples who were brought to work as slaves to the New World. Q: Between the Quimbanda and Palo Mayombe religious traditions, which one of the two is more powerful? A: I have been initiated into both Caribbean and Brazilian Congo reli-gious traditions and there is no question and without a doubt that the Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda Congo religious system ( Vititi Congo Bizango ) is by far the strongest and most powerful magical Congo religious systems available. If you want to see fast \"hardcore magical results\" then seek out a qualified \"Quimbandeiro Priest.\" A: Caribbean Palo Mayombe is considered as a magical primer to Bra-zilian Quimbanda which is considered as \"High Magic\" because Quim-banda uses the advance spiritual principles of the occult magical arts. The magical formulas as well as the sacred initiations and ancient oc-cult invocations associated with Brazilian Quimbanda are much more complex, complicated and bring about faster magical results. Q: If I have already been initiated into Mysteries of Caribbean Palo Mayombe can I still receive initiations in Brazilian Quimbanda? A: The answer is yes, but you have to start from the beginning and that means you have to get “scratched ” all over again in the Quimbanda religious tradition. Although both magical religious systems are derived from the Congo they are very distinctly practiced differently. The believ-ers from the Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda Congo religious tradition place a great emphasis on the magical power of the Spirit Exu and the powerful spiritual entities of the \"astral realm.\" The only thing that you"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 would have to do is find a qualified Quimbandeiro Priest who would be willing to assist you and to clean up the \"mess\" and then follow their initiation religious procedure for that Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda Congo Munanzo. Q: If I have received my initiation into Santeria ( La Ocha ) can I still practice Brazilian Candomble Orixa religion without having to do my Orixa initiation in Candomble again? A: No. You would have to be initiated again. It would be better to start from the beginning with a set of new Orixa Mysteries that actually really do work and that were presented to you correctly. Q: If an individual is incarcerated but wants to be initiated or join a Congo or Orixa Temple how do they do that? A: The incarcerated individual must join a formal Congo Temple on the outside that will be willing to sponsor them and to be spiritually respon-sible for the individual while they are incarcerated and also be willing to do all of the necessary spiritual offerings to the Congo Spirits in their name ( the incarcerated individual ) . The incarcerated individual can formally join a traditional Congo Munanzo through mail correspondence with the Tata from a Congo Munanzo. When the incarcerated individual leaves jail they must then immediately go to the same Congo Temple that assisted them while they were incarcerated and then formally be initiated without delay thanking the Congo Spirits and the Tata for their spiritual assistance that they received while they were incarcerated. \"If you do not seek out initiation at the formal Congo Munanzo that as-sisted you when you are released from jail, it will just a matter of time before the same Congo Spirits that help you get out put you back be-hind bars once again.\" The AMERICAN CANDOMBLE CHURCH is cur-rently the only legal religious entity and Congo religious organization that offers free spiritual assistance and membership in a formal Congo"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77 Munanzo to individuals who are presently incarcerated. Q: While I was incarcerated, I joined a formal Congo Munanzo.

Can I just join another Congo Munanzo that is in close proximity to me without having to incur the extra added expense to travel to the original Congo Munanzo that assisted me while I was incarcerated? A: The answer is NO. The spirits ( Nkisi ) from a particular Congo Munanzo made a spiritual sacrifice to help and to assist you while you were incarcerated. If you want to continue to receive their blessings, then you need to also make a personal sacrifice. If you do things cor-rectly then you will be spiritually rewarded. Make initiation and travel arrangements with the Tata from that Congo Munanzo to get formally initiated ASAP. If you are a sincere individual I'am sure that you and the presiding Tata can make special financial arrangements so that you can begin your spiritual journey into the beautiful World of the Congo Spirits. \"ALWAYS BE LOYAL AND TRUE TO YOUR TATA ( G O DFATHER ) AND TO THE SPIRITUAL MYSTERIES OF THE CONGO MUNANZO THAT GAVE BIRTH TO YOU\". Q: I am a Tata or a Babalorixa and I have my own formal Temple. Should I organize my temple as a formal Church or am I protected from religious prosecution without forming a formal Church in the United States ? A: No, you are not protected. By being loosely organized without having the appropriated formal organization title of \"church\" or \"religious or-ganization\" you are setting yourself up for all kinds of legal problems. Remember, this religious tradition although legal is still not acceptable in America and is seen as taboo.

Q: Should I join a Congo or Orixa Temple that is formally organized and recognized as a formal church or religious organization in the United States ? or should I join a Congo or Orixa Temple that is run from somebody's back yard, dirty garage or from their home ? A: A legitimate formal spiritual church can be held in any location, but if you will be joining a Congo Temple or Orixa Temple that is not organ-ized as a legitimate church or legal religious organization within the Federal and State Laws of the United States then you should really be-ware. So the answer is \"no\" if the Temple is being run from a dirty back-yard garage or from any other location without being legally and for-mally organized. The first question that you should ask the Tata when you are seeking out initiation into a formal Congo Temple is about their group's legal status. If they laugh or tell you that \"Carlos Montenegro\" does not know what he is talking about or that \"Carlos Montenegro is full of shit\" or they tell you that they do not have one ( an organized legal church ) then this should be a sure \"warning sign\" of what you do not want to happen ( fraud) and that means \"bend over, grab your knees and get ready for the big screw.\" We are living in America and in extremely difficult economically hard times, so get with the program and pay attention\". \"Wake up and smell the coffee\".

The answer is very clear and simple. The answer is finan-cial and monetary gain. The true fact is that when an individual always has negative comments to say about a particular individual usually this individual is very insecure about themselves. This is not my opinion it is just basic \"Psychology 101\". Negative comments are also a sign of jeal-ousy and fear. When an individual reverts to making unnecessary nega-tive comments of \"character assassination\" about a particular individual that is a sure sign that you are dealing with a very ignorant and unedu-cated individual. Remember that most of the individuals associated with the Orixa Religion and the Congo Religion especially in the Los Ange-les area don't even have a third grade education, so why would you believe them and why would you want to be initiated with someone with such a limited and narrow mind that can't even \"think out of the box.\" \"Most of these negative, envious and closed minded individuals have not ever been outside of the five mile radius where they live.\" Character assassination is one of the oldest tricks in the book.

For over 25 years, my religious philosophy, theology and ideology has always remained constant and has never deviated outside of the lines of our Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda Religious Tradition. I hope that I didn't sound so hard and rough, but it is what it is. By keeping within the confines of strictness and following this religious belief in a very orthodox religious form we ( Casa Montenegro) have been able to avoid spiritual contamination from the outside spiritual world. I hope that I don't seem to come across as being to arrogant, but \"it is what it is.\" I am a seasoned mature educated religious practitioner of the Congo religion and my professional credentials and accomplishments are unmatched by any other initiated member of this particular magical religious tradition and of the entire Santeria and Palo Mayombe Reli-gious Community.: I have also written and published more than 500 books about Congo Sorcery, Black Magic and the Occult. All of these books instantly achieved success and were number one \"best sellers\" in the international literary occult world over and over again. My books are read and enjoyed by over 20 million devoted fans who all have very good results with my magical formulas.

Q: What if someone tells me that the method by which the Montenegro Family practice Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda does not really work and that I should not get initiated into the Brazilian Orthodox Quimbanda Mysteries? A: This is a very simple question to answer. A religious tradition which has endured and survived the ultimate \"test of time\" is usually a very good sign that they are doing something right and something correct. If the religious tradition is not a viable belief system then it will usually be-come extinct and non existent within its first 100 years. This is not my opinion, it is a proven scientific fact based on the \"Laws and Principles of Spiritual Evolution\". \"Only the strongest of religious beliefs and reli-gious traditions will continued to be practiced and attract new converts.\" \"Survival of the Fittest\". Although the Congo religion is thousands of years old, our particular religious tradition ( Vititi Congo Bizango ) has been in existence for more than 146 years. It doesn't look like our reli-gious tradition will become extinct anytime soon. In fact our religious tradition ( Vititi Congo Bizango ) is expanding with leaps and bounds. We have initiated members all over the world who are practicing the Vititi Congo Bizango Religious Tradition with success. The initiated members of our particular religious tradition are extremely educated individuals who are committed to Brazilian Mysticism and Latin Ameri-can Spiritual teachings and dissemination of spiritual knowledge in its purest and most Orthodox Religious form. It has only been through the blessings of the spiritual entities that our tradition has survived into modern times. That is why we truly believe that our particular religious tradition of Vititi Congo Bizango has been ordained my God. Q: What do you think about the art of spiritual war and or engaging in"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 spiritual warfare? Why do people call you \"The General\" ? A: I have been in many Spiritual Wars and I have never lost one, al-though it may appear at times to my enemies that they have won. Win-ning one Spiritual Battle is not the same as winning the complete Spiri-tual War. During a Spiritual War there are many Spiritual Battles and some you may win and some you may lose. The ultimate victory in a \"Spiritual War\" can take many years to be victorious over your occult enemies. Spiritual War requires intellectual spiritual strategic planning and preparation. Remember that old saying? \"Its Not Over Until The Fat Lady Sings\". The basic concept that you should always remember and keep in mind is that \"In the Game of Musical Chairs ( Spiritual War against your Occult Enemies ) Don't Get Caught Without a Seat.\" I am sure everybody at one time or another during their childhood played this game at a birthday party. Spiritual War is the exact same concept. With this important ideology, I have always been victorious eventually over everyone of my \"occult enemies.\" Because I have been so successful in my Spiritual War campaigns and have so much past historical experi-ence in defeating my occult enemies in Spiritual Wars, I have been given the official title by my occult enemies of \"The General\". \"DON'T PLAY WITH FIRE BECAUSE YOU WILL GET BURNED EVE-RYTIME AND ALL THE TIME.\" Q: Does black magic really work? What if I believe that it can't affect me because I' am a Christian and believe in God? A: This is a very simple question to answer. The spiritual power of black magic is like a live electrical wire. Black magic is pure raw cosmic en-ergy that is manipulated by a magician or sorcerer to control or to domi-nate a particular individual or situation. When the live electrical wire ( b lack magic ) touches water, somebody is going to get burned if you happen to be in its direct path. So the answer is yes. Black Magic is real"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 and even though you may be a Christian and believe in God you will still be affected by it because Black Magic is energy and it can not make any distinct differentiation between an individual who is a devout Christian or Non-Christian. Q: If I want to organize my temple into a formal church or religious organization in the United States how can I do that? A: If you are interested in receiving information about how to do that you can write to the American Candomble Church for free information about how to incorporate your religious group under a formal religious organization or church within the legal Federal and State guidelines of the United States. A: There are several reasons why a Congo Munanzo or Orixa Temple should formally organize under the protection of a religious organiza-tion. The first reason is that by formally organizing under Federal Laws, your church group will be able to seek out legal representation and se-cure the legal services of a qualified and experienced civil rights lawyer who will be able to give out legal advice concerning unwarranted at-tacks by local legal authorities who so many times unjustly seek out to attack practitioners of African based religions because of ignorance. In many cases, the legal authorities will think twice before embarking on a campaign ( w itch hunt ) against and prosecuting religious practitioners of a formal legal organized religious organization that is represented by legal counsel. The second thing is that when you become a legal reli-gious organization you will be able to apply for and access Federal funding ( Federal grants ) for such things as education grants, educa-tional programs, special cultural events grants and even access money to buy land or build a church. By organizing under a legal religious or-ganization it doesn't mean that your member' names will be publicly known. Membership in that religious organization can still be private"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 without everybody ( Federal Government ) being in your private per-sonal business. The third thing is that when you become a legal reli-gious organization, the fees associated with religious education ( i nitiations ) can become tax deductible for its members when your organization is approved for their 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status.Q: Does the Congo religion or the Orixa religion have a Central Religious Authority in the United States? A: No. there is no Central Religious Authority. Unless the particular Orixa or Congo Temple is formally organized as a legal religious organi-zation there is no Central Religious Authority. So that means if you are going to be initiated into an Orixa or Congo Temple that does not have legal status, \"anything goes\". That does not sound like such a good idea. Does it? Q: Why has the Santeria Religious Community and the Caribbean Palo Mayombe Community become so \"spiritually contaminated\" in recent years with such a high report of fraudulent criminal activity. The follow-ing answer to this question is \"common knowledge\" within the Santeria and Caribbean Congo Community, but it is a topic that nobody wants to talk about for obvious reasons. A: Santeria as a religion was brought to United States in the 1940's and the 1950's by \"White Cuban Santeros.\" The original \"old timers\" Santeros were very strict and Orthodox with their Orixa religious prac-tices. These original Santero Priests were the first and the last ones to practice the Santeria religion in its purest form. Most of these original Santero Priest are now deceased and their original religious concepts behind the beautiful Santeria religion buried with them. These very im-portant \"founding fathers\" of the Santeria religion as found and origi-nally practiced in the United States were extremely educated and fol-lowed the Orixa religious theology and religious principles in its most"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 Orthodox religious and purest form. If the Orixa Mysteries were not or-ganized and safe guarded by these original \"White Cuban Santeros\", the Caribbean Santeria Orixa religion as we known it today would not be in existence although it has taken a complete \"left turn\" in recent years. The Mariel boat lift ( L os Marielitos ) was a mass exodus of Cu-bans who departed from Cuba's Mariel Harbor for the United States between April 15 and October 31, 1980. The event was precipitated by a sharp downturn in the Cuban economy which led to internal tensions on the island and a bid by up to 10,000 Cubans to gain asylum outside of Cuba. The Cuban government subsequently announced that anyone who wanted to leave could do so, and an exodus by boat started shortly afterwards. The exodus was organized by Cuban-Americans with the agreement of Cuban president Fidel Castro. The exodus started to have negative political implications for U.S. president Jimmy Carter when it was discovered that the majority of the Cuban exiles had been released from \"Cuban jails\" and \"Cuban mental health facilities.\" The Mariel boat lift was ended by mutual agreement between the two gov-ernments involved in October 1980. By that point, as many as 125,000 \"Cuban criminals\" had made the journey to Florida. Most of these Cu-ban criminals were \"Afro Cubans\". It was not until the late 1990's and early 2000's that the \"Afro Cuban Community\" who were considered by the established \"White Cuban Santeria Community\" as criminals were given access to be able to interact and participate with them within the secrecy of the traditional Orixa and Congo Temples. This intermixing of Cuban ethnic groups within the Santeria religion historically marks the beginning of the end for traditional Caribbean Orixa religion as originally practiced by the original early Santeria Santero Priests.During the early 1980's through the present time, the Santeria religion and the Carib-bean Palo Mayombe religious beliefs started to become \"tainted\" and \"spiritually contaminated\" by a very aggressive criminal element that"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 has unfortunately permanently stained and damaged the legitimacy of the current Caribbean Orixa practice and of Caribbean Congo religion. This negative element continues to this present day. There are several reasons why this very destructive element was able to gain hold within the Caribbean Orixa Community and the Caribbean Congo Palo Mayombe Community. This criminal and fraudulent activity was brought into the Orixa religion by Cuban criminals released by Fidel Castro who were conmen, gypsy fortune teller circus stars, thieves, drug users, drug dealers, prostitutes, murderers, pedafiles, emotional disturbed in-dividuals who were under very serious psychiatric medical care and only \"God\" knows what else. For all of these very obvious reasons, that is why Fidel Castro let them go, because he was tired of supporting a bunch of criminals and undesirables that he considered the \"trash of Cuban society\". When these individuals immigrated to the United States many of them eventually made their way to Miami, New York and to Los Angeles to set up Botanica Shops where they would be able to continue their criminal activities under the guise of the Orixa and Congo religious traditions by fleecing unsuspected individuals who were not familiar with the real authentic aspects of the Santeria and Palo Mayombe Religion. The City of Los Angeles seems to have become the primary \"Mecca\" and \"hub\" for this fraudulent criminal activity within the Santeria Com-munity. That is the reason why it would be better for the new initiate to join a legal organized spiritual temple or religious organization that has educated mature members that are serious about the religion. It is time for the entire Santeria Religious Community and the Caribbean Congo religious Community to clean up their \"acts\" and to get legally correct or face the negative consequences that one day will reach your doors by not having the appropriate protection of a legal church or spiritual or-ganization. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87 Q: Why are initiated members of the Santeria Religion and the Palo Mayombe Religion losing faith with their Temples and deciding to leave or seek out the assistance from Brazilian Quimbanda Congo Temples? A: The answer is simply that these individuals are just tired of being \"ripped off\" and because they are not learning anything to advance their spirituality in a positive direction that will benefit them in their everyday personal lives. Q: I want to get initiated into the Mysteries of Caribbean Palo Mayombe. Where is Palo Mayombe practiced in the United States in its purest form? A: If you want to get initiated into the \"legitimate\" authentic Mysteries of traditional Palo Mayombe in the United States you need to go to the \"Big Apple\", New York City. I have traveled and visited many Congo Temples in the United States as well as around the World and I can honestly tell you without a doubt that the Congo Priests ( Paleros ) found in New York City are by far the best and most powerful practitio-ners of Orthodox \"Regla De Congo\", (legitimate Congo religion ) and \"Congo Sorcery Magic\" found in its purest form in the United States. The second would be New Jersey, the third would be Chicago, the fourth would be Miami. The City of Los Angeles would be the worst place to get initiated into the Palo Mayombe and Orixa Mysteries on a “ scale of 1 to 10 ” because of the high rate of fraud and criminal activ-ity found within the traditional Orixa and Congo Temples in the City of Los Angeles. Although the Congo practitioners in the City of Los Ange-les claim to practice Palo Mayombe in its purest form they are actually really practicing \"Kimbisa\" another Congo derived religion and not Palo Mayombe as they claim to be.

Q: I want to get initiated into the Mysteries of Brazilian Quimbanda. Where is the Quimbanda religion practiced in the United States in its purest form? A: It is very difficult to find a legitimate authentic Quimbanda Temple outside of Brazil.

The Mysteries and Tra-ditions of the American Candomble Church are 146 years old. That is a long time to be practicing Congo magic with great success.

At the writing of this book I have had the opportunity to have had success-fully initiated more than 11,000 individuals into the sacred Congo reli-gious tradition and Mysteries from all parts of the World. Although there may be some differences and variations of this particular initiation cere-mony, the religious structure presented here of this complete religious ritual is the same as other Congo temples found throughout the World. If your Rayado Initiation Ceremony was not done very similar to the fol-lowing initiation ceremony presented here, then more than likely it was not done correctly and you should seek out an experienced Tata ( P riest ) from the Congo religion to correct it. The following Rayado Initiation Ceremony is how to do this very sacred ceremony in front of any of the Congo spirit ngangas. STEP I - THE CONGO DIVINATION CEREMONY The interested individual ( n ew initiate ) must first consult with the Congo spirits with an experienced Tata ( Congo Priest ) using the Chamalongo Divination System. This can be done using the more com-monly found and practiced simple ( 4 ) coconut shell Chamalongo method or it can be done using the full set of prepared Chamalongo ( 1 6 ) spirit seashells to determine if the individual will be allowed to enter into that particular Munanzo. If the spirits respond in favor of the individual, then the Tata will determine when the ceremony can take place and what the new individual must do before the actual Rayado Initiation Ceremony takes place. "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 STEP II - A SPIRITUAL OFFERING TO THE ANCESTORS The individual must make an spiritual offering to their own ancestor spirits to receive permission to even proceed. This offering is usually placed on the floor directly in front of the Eggun Spirits Ancestor Shrine at the Congo Temple that you are seeking initiation into. When you bring the offering, the Tata will call upon the Ancestors from the temple and from your family to witness the sacred ceremony. A SPIRITUAL FOOD OFFERING TO THE EGGUN SPIRITS 1.

THE SPIRITS MAY ALSO REQUIRE A COOKED HOT FOOD OFFERING ( A DDIMU ) SUCH AS RICE AND BEANS, YUCCA, POTATOES AND EVEN COOKED MEAT OR POULTRY. DURING YOUR INITIAL CON-SULTATION WITH THE CHAMALONGO, THE TATA WILL DETER-MINE WHAT THE ANCESTOR SPIRITS REQUIRE IN ORDER TO PROCEED WITH THE RAYADO INITIATION CEREMONY.

I also would like to add the comment that they ( new initiate) must complete the Rayado ritual within 21 days if the individual will not be receiving their Rayado initiation the same day as presenting the offering to the Eggun Spirits. If the individual waits more than 21 days from the time that they present the offerings to the Eggun Spirits, there may be a change in the individual's spiritual destiny as foretold by the Chamalon-gos and they will have to have the Tata read the Chamalongos once again to determine if the spiritual alignment of the individual has not changed since the last Chamalongo divination reading. When the indi-vidual arrives at the Munanzo for the initiation ritual, they must bring all of the following items: A COMPLETE CHANGE OF \"NEW\" WHITE CLOTHES, A WHITE BANDANA, A WHITE PLATE, ONE COCONUT, ( 3 ) HOUSEHOLD CANDLES ( WHITE ) , ONE LARGE BOTTLE OF WHITE RUM ( C ACHACA/AGUARDIENTE ) , ONE PACKAGE OF TABACCO CI-GARS, ONE \"NEW\" WHITE TOWEL, BLACK ROOSTERS ( 2 ) , THE SPIRITUAL OFFERING ( DERECHO ) "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 STEP IV - THE ROMPEMIENTO ( SPIRITUAL CLEANSING ) The spiritual purification ritual that the individual will first have done by the Tata or by the other members of the Congo temple is called “r ompemiento”. The rompemiento ceremony is a spiritual cleansing done using cigar smoke, rum, black soap and omiero herbal bath liquid. The cleansing is done by the priests present praying over the individual who will become initiated by reciting a series of Congo prayers that are said to the spirits so they will spiritually descend upon the cleansing ceremony to free the individual from any type of negative vibration. The rompemiento ceremony is usually done outside in a special area of the Congo temple. When the prayers are finished, the individual will have their clothes cut and then ritually torn off their bodies and then bathed in a special herbal bath liquid mixture known as omiero. This omiero is a mixture of various herbs and is ritually prepared and magically charged for maximum strength and spiritual power. The tearing of the clothes represents the individual leaving their past life behind and to prepare for a brand new spiritual life. The individual should be given authentic real African Black Soap to bath with along while they are bathing. The Congo temple is a sacred holy place of God and therefore all individu-als that are allowed to participate in the Rayado Initiation Ceremony should also take an omiero spiritual bath at home before coming to the temple to assist in the ceremony. When coming to the Congo Munanzo to assist the Tata with the initiation process, you must learn to leave your problems outside and away from the temple.

This process is called “penetencia”. This is a time for the initiate to reflect on their past life and to think about what they are about to do. This is also the time for the initiate to start to focus on their ancestor spirits, their spirit guides and the Congo spirits and also for the spirits to start to surround the initiate to start bringing them blessings. The new initiate will remain kneeling until the initiation ceremony begins. This “p enetencia” time usually last about 1 to 3 hours depending on your particular Congo temple.

This formula is taken from the Brazilian Or-thodox Quimbanda Congo religious tradition ( Vititi Congo Bizango ) . This sacred powder may be prepared in a different manner depending on the Congo religious system which are being initiated into. If you re-ceived your Rayado Initiation Ceremony and the Tata did not place this sacred Rayado Initiation Powder into the Rayado \"scratchings\" your Rayado was not done correctly. It is only by placing this sacred powder into your Rayado \"scratchings\" that the new initiate will be spiritually connected to the Congo Spirits. If you did not have this done during your Rayado Initiation Ceremony the Congo Spirits will not be able to protect you nor will they be able to recognize you as one of their own children. This sacred powder is also referred to as \"Polvo De Muerto\" by the initiates of Caribbean Palo Mayombe religious tradition. IF THE RAYADO POWDER IS \"NOT\" PREPARED CORRECTLY AND IT IS PLACED INTO THE RAYADO \"SCRATCHINGS\" OF THE NEW INITIATE IT WILL BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE IT FROM THEIR BODIES. THIS CAN BE EXTREMELY SPIRITUALLY DAMAG-ING TO THE SRIRITUAL WELL BEING OF THE NEW INITIATE. IF THE RAYADO POWDER IS NOT PREPARED CORRECTLY THE NEW INITIATE CAN DEVELOP TERMINAL ILLNESS AND CAUSE THE EVENTUAL DEATH OF THE NEW INITIATE.

I would like to caution the individual who is thinking about preparing this Nganga because you will be making a pact with the dark side of the universe.

WHITE HEAD QUARTZ Melody has worked with this crystal and here are her findings of the metaphysical properties: \"It has been interesting to work with quartz from a specific locale at the exclusion of other quartz from other areas. In addition to the properties formerly researched for quartz, the follow-ing has been noted. The White Head Mine quartz tends to brighten pale and ashen appearances and characters, bringing more spice, enthusi-asm, passion, and spirit to ones being; and, bringing smoothness to ones nature and personality. It has been used to stimulate aptitude for intelligent communication, both on the physical plane ( inspiring the mind and the quickening of the wit ) and through the etheric realms ( b eing a superior energetic stone for opening the crown chakra ) . In the etheric realms, it has stimulated receiving abilities for information from those who experienced ancient civilizations ( e.g. the first civiliza-tions on this planet-stemming from what has been called the twelfth planet ) , and from civilizations, which have not been in residence upon our earth.

Used by a person in a dominant role, the energy has been shown to provide success in the direction the energy is focused. It has also been shown to abate explosive outbursts ( even if they occur ) , by extracting the cause from the situation; clarity is pro-moted and suddenly, calmness prevails. \"Burying the hatchet\" is a cli-ché, which comes to mind-After holding this quartz, there, is absolutely no reason that one can determine for \"holding a grudge\". The general themes of the energy of this White Head Mine quartz are communica-tion, intelligence, release, and actualization. On the health side, in addi-tion to brightening ones aura and ones physical appearance, it has been used as an elixir ( t aken internally and placed externally on the crown chakra ) to stimulate all of the above, and to assist in the recov-ery of atrophy from muscular deterioration.

Stones are considered sacred to practitio-ners of the Congo religion as well as for religious practitioners of the Orixa religion. In the Orixa religion, sacred stones are called OTANES. It is believed that within each sacred stone contains the past memory of the Universe and of the Cosmos. This memory is called the ASKASTIC RECORDS and that is why stones are used to represent the powerful deities. Each of the Congo spirits are prepared with a variety of ingredi-ents, but the sacred stones with represent each particular deity is unique. Each of these stones can only be collected at very specific lo-cations in order for the spirits to manifest through the Congo Spirit Nganga. The following is a list of the Congo Spirits and where their sa-cred stones are found and to be collected. If your Congo Spirit Nganga was not prepared with the stone sacred for the spirits of a certain loca-tion then the energy of the Congo Spirit Nganga will not work correctly. Once these sacred stones have been ritually collected and placed into the Congo Spirit Nganga the Congo Priest must give ritual and invoca-tions to the spirits to awaken and unlock the “ASKASTIC RECORDS ” which are held inside and within the sacred MATARI stones. Once you have located and found your sacred Matari stones you need to check with the spirits using the Chamalongo ( 4 ) coconut shell divination system to establish the fact that the Matari stones that you found are infact the actual Matari stone of the particular deity that you are prepar-ing the Nganga for.

This is no accident. A woman's body is something of a mirror of the moon and her ways. In many ways the difference between the sun and the moon are very simi-lar to the differences between men and women. The different personali-ties the moon presents throughout her cycle have perhaps the most profound affect on ritual workings than any other Time Correspon-dence. In order to coordinate your ritual workings with the cycles of the moon, you can follow the generalized guidelines below or the more ad-vanced guidelines. ***Note that the more Time Correspondences you add to your ritual workings, the less you will need to rely on the more advanced system of the lunar cycle. And, in fact, sometimes you will be unable to use the more advanced system especially if you try to incorporate either the Lunar Zodiacal Calendar or the system of the Days of the Week. In all, familiarize yourself with all systems, but use what works best for you.

The full moon is the point when the moon reflects all light from the sun back to the earth. It is the most po-tent time of the lunar cycle. The Waning Moon Magic for decreases that mirror the decreasing size of the moon includ-ing: banishings, exorcisms, cleansings, magic to rid yourself of a bad habit, any type of ritual to rid yourself of negativity whether it is from human or spirit sources. The horns on the crescent you see in the sky during the waning phase of the moon are facing to your right. The Black Moon This particular phase of the moon carries some controversy. Some practitioners insist that no magic be performed on this night, however, next to the full moon, the black moon is the second most potent time of the lunar cycle. Either highly difficult banishings that have been resis-tant to rituals performed on other nights of the waning moon can be abolished during this night when the moon is at it's blackest in the sky. However, take care to perform these banishing before the moon is at it's darkest point otherwise the moon will no longer be the Black Moon, but the New Moon which is associated with beginnings rather than end-ings. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For more complex and advanced guidelines, you can follow the guide-lines presented below. "},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"412 The New Moon The new phase of the moon begins when the moon is hidden from sight due to the earth's position between the sun and the moon. No sunlight is reflected back down to us from the moon's surface. This phase is sometimes mistaken for the Black Moon, which directly precedes it. The New Moon and all it's accompanying characteristics can be relevant from three days after the darkest point of the moon. Experiment to de-termine how best this system works for you. During this time, the follow-ing types of ritual/spell work are most appropriate: As the newest and earliest point in a new moon cycle, the new moon is seen by most prac-titioners as the most appropriate time to begin new projects, new spells and any rituals that require many days to complete.

With rituals that require less lunar potency or are the first in a line of several consecutive rituals that lead up to the full moon, you can confi-dently use this phase of the moon. For example, a healing performed to ease a cold or mild chronic illness can easily be started during the wax-ing crescent phase of the moon. However, a more serious illness would be better served during the waxing gibbous phase. Ideally, with some minor examples, nearly all magic would be best divided out between the full or new moon, but this is such a short period of time each month, that we delegate certain phases to certain less important tasks. How-ever, remember two things. For very serious illnesses the full ( for heal-ing the illness ) or black ( f or banishing the illness) moons are the best choices, but they are not always necessary for more minor prob-lems. Also the time does come sometimes when we have no choice but to do ritual work during incompatible times. In emergency cases, don't let bad timing stop you. Use other Nature Correspondences or the other types of magic ( Mental or Spiritual Magic ) to offset your lack of tim-ing.

However, magic that re-quires more lunar energy than the waxing crescent can provide should if possible be delayed until this time period because of it's closer prox-imity to the full moon.

The earth is completely out of the path between these two bodies and the energy of the moon is at it's most potent. The full moon is the most potent time of the entire month and the time when many traditions of witchcraft hold their Sabbaths, or ritual gatherings or celebrations. Since there is so much controversy over what actually begins and ends the cycle of the moon, there is some discrepancy over what kind of magic is best performed during this time. Technically, the full moon is the middle of the moon's cycle when the positive aspects of the moon's influence are at their peak, however many practitioners view the full moon as an down slope rather than a peak and thus either of the two types of magic below may be performed a full three days before the full moon depending on your personal preference.

So for mi-nor decreasing and banishing rituals, the waning gibbous moon is more appropriate because not as much lunar decreasing energy is required to be successful. However for more serious decreases and banishings, the waning crescent moon is most appropriate because of it's closer proximity to the black moon ( the greatest point of decrease ) ."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"420 The Waning Half Moon This is another unique time of the month which allows for all forms of banishing or decreasing magic that can otherwise be performed on the waning phase of the moon.

The science of “Occult Physics” is the study of an unknown or invisible matter and its motion through space time and all that derives from these, such as energy and force. More broadly, it is the general analysis of how these unseen invisible forces react in nature, conducted in order to understand how the world and universe behave. A theorem is a term used in Math to describe an idea or concept that can be proved. In mathematics, a theorem is a state-ment which has been proved on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and previously accepted state-ments, such as axioms. The derivation of a theorem is often interpreted as a proof of the truth of the resulting expression, but different deduc-tive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the meanings of the derivation rules. The proofs of theorems have two components, called the hypotheses and the conclusions. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument demonstrating that the conclusions are a necessary consequence of the hypotheses, in the sense that if the hy-potheses are true then the conclusions must also be true, without any further assumptions. The concept of a theorem is therefore fundamen-tally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific theory, which is empirical. Although they can be written in a completely symbolic form using, for example, propositional calculus, theorems are often ex-pressed in a natural language such as English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments intended to demonstrate that a formal sym-bolic proof can be constructed. Such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones — indeed, many mathematicians"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"426 would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way why it is obviously true. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theo-rem. Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being \"trivial\", or \"difficult\", or \"deep\", or even \"beautiful\". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once diffi-cult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be simply stated, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connec-tions between disparate areas of mathematics. Over the past 25 years as an active Congo religious practitioner of the magical Congo sorcery traditions and assisting thousands of individuals I have been able to gain insight into how the magical powers of the Congo spirits manifest within our dimension. I have a formal education in the Sciences and Genetics. Infact, as a teen I was one of the few to be awarded the prestigious award for my research in genetics by the National Academy of Sciences not just once, but twice. So I have al-ways approached the magical results of my spiritual works from a sci-entific point of view to try and explain how and why these spirits can manifest on earth within our dimension. When I first started doing spiri-tual work for individuals I wasn't sure if my success was due to chance or coincidence and therefore I set out to prove that infact the spirits were not real and that it was only through a strange change of events which caused my spiritual work to be effective. So with each of my spells that I used the Congo Spirits, I was able to experiment using the results of my findings to conclude to a scientific formula which explains the process by which these spirits when present . My scientific experi-mentation took me to many different theories to explain why the spirit work was working so fast and accurate."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"427 So after much time and experimentation I was able to derive a scientific formulas which fully explains the nature of how these powerful spirits manifest and work. This mathematical formula is called the “Montenegro Theorem ” and it is very precise. By using the Montene-gro Theorem you will be able to determine how long it will take for the spirits to travel to a designated target and start to work. There are how-ever various factors and elements which must be present in order for this formula to be true and correct. The following factors must be pre-sent in order for the Montenegro Theorem to be effective and work for the Congo Sorcerer and or necromancer. The following conditions must be present and met in order to fully realize the following Montenegro Theorem. Although the following conditions are generally for Congo Sorcerers, it can be also used by individuals practicing traditional Euro-pean Necromancy Sorcery, but with some changes in the ritual format.

SPIRITUAL CONDITIONS WHICH MUST BE PRESENT 1.The Congo Spirit Nganga must be prepared correctly and fully charged. 2.The Congo Spirit Signature must be drawn on the ground directly in front of the Congo Spirit Nganga or be present 3.

The weather and sky must be clear and not raining. 7. Once the spirit is given the specific instructions then the spirits are sent out using “fula powder ”. The spiritual philosophy and theory behind this theorem is that once you send out the Congo spirit to its desired Target Designation it will and may take several attempts for the spirit to penetrate and puncture the aura or protective light which surrounds each and every human be-ing. This process can usually take 3 to 9 times, although one thing is for sure is that the following theorem formula is very precise and I have decided to share this very secret formula with you as I believe it will be of assistance to the Congo Sorcerer or Necromancer to be able to de-termine the precise timing of a magical working. If the formula does not work for you them there is a problem with one of the conditions which must be fully satisfied in order for it to work. After doing these magical works for many years and for thousands of individuals with success, I can honestly say that I may be the first individual to be able to explain in mathematical terms how these spirits travel and arrive at a specific tar-get designation to the exact moment and precise second.

The shells are believed to be the mouth piece of the spirits which when interpreted will reveal the past, present and the future des-tiny of an individual. The divination of the shells is known to Congo practitioners as Vititi Nkobo. The cowrie shells which are used by a Congo priest belong to the Congo Spirit Lucero, the Keeper of the Crossroads. In the Palo Mayombe religious tradition, seashell divination is also known as the Chamalongo. The word Chamalongo means cemetery. The literal translation of the Chamalongo is the diving by means of the spirits from the cemetery and of the spirit nganga. There are many divination methods used by a priest of the Congo religion such as divining with the use of stones, bones, crystals and other items. The interpretations are a mixture of spirituality, spiritual visions and tra-ditional Congo folklore. There are very few initiated Mayomberos ( C ongo Priest ) who actually know the secrets and the Mysteries of the true chamalongo divination ceremony. This very rare form of divina-tion is rarely seen outside of the Caribbean and Brazil. The chamalongo shells are read on a special divination table which is known as the “T ablero De Muerto”, the table of the dead. This specially prepared wood divination table is painted and etched with various sacred sym-bols of the spirits and of the stars, heavens and the earth. Although this divination ritual is not presented here in detail, you can read more about this ancient divination system in the book entitled, EL TABLERO DE MUERTO, CONGO DIVINATIONS written for initiated members of the Congo religious tradition known as Palo Mayombe.

This formula is taken from the Brazilian Ortho-dox Quimbanda Congo religious tradition ( Vititi Congo Bizango ) . This sacred powder may be prepared in a different manner depending on the Congo religious system which are being initiated into. If you re-ceived your Ozain Initiation Ceremony and the Tata did not place this sacred Ozain Rayado Initiation Powder into the Rayado \"scratchings\" your Ozain Initiation Ceremony was not done correctly. It is only by placing this sacred powder into your Ozain Rayado \"scratchings\" that the new initiate will be spiritually connected to the Congo Spirit of Ozain. If you did not have this done during your Ozain Initiation Initia-tion Ceremony the Congo Spirit Ozain will not be able to protect you nor will he be able to recognize you as one of his own children. This sacred powder is also referred to as \"Polvo De Ozain\" by the initiates of Carib-bean Palo Mayombe religious tradition. IF THE OZAIN RAYADO POWDER IS \"NOT\" PREPARED COR-RECTLY AND IT IS PLACED INTO THE OZAIN RAYADO \"SCRATCHINGS\" OF THE NEW INITIATE IT WILL BE ALMOST IM-POSSIBLE TO REMOVE IT FROM THEIR BODIES. THIS CAN BE EXTREMELY SPIRITUALLY DAMAGING TO THE SRIRITUAL WELL BEING OF THE NEW OZAINISTA INITIATE.

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED YOUR OZAIN INITIA-TION CEREMONY AND THERE WAS NOTHING PACKED INTO THE \"SCRATCHINGS\" OR IF THEY ONLY USED THE ASH FROM A CI-GAR, YOU GOT \"RIPPED OFF.\" THIS IS A VERY COMMON PRAC-TICE IN PALO MAYOMBE MUNANZOS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGE-LES.

The best magical ingredients are all prepared handmade. They can be purchased from an experienced Congo priest or you can collect them yourself and prepare them. Hand-made magical products usually have the best results. Over the past years that I have had the opportunity to assist 1000’ s of individuals with their spiritual problems and spiritual request, I have had to usually prepare these magical products by hand in order to see fast and quick results. In fact, it is rare that I may use anything from a botanica at all unless it is the real magical herb or ingredient which it says it is. The following magical products can be found and collected in nature or from a botanica that sells real occult magical products. Another thing to re-member that although these ingredients may all be found in nature, in order to prepare them and to bring out the magical properties in these natural ingredients, you must always first invoke the Congo Gods and ask them for their permission to be able to use these magical natural ingredients. By invoking the Congo Gods you will be able to bring out the magical properties of the natural herbs and other sacred ingredi-ents.

Afoche powders are ritually prepared using sacred prayers and invocations which bring out the magical properties of the particular magical powder being prepared. Afoche powders can be prepared ritually for a variety of different types of spiritual usages from bringing luck, attracting love and for black magic spells of harm and destruction. All of the following Afoche De Ozain powders should be prepared and ritually empowered on top of the “Tablero De Muerto ” by an Ozainista Priest (A Congo Priest who has been initi-ated into the Mysteries of the Spirit Ozain ) .These very powerful magi-cal powders can be used by themselves or in combination with any type of magical ritual/spiritual work that you may be doing for yourself or for your clients.

Each of the palos listed below come from a specific “ spirit tree ” that is believed to possess a certain type of magical power and spiritual attribute that when used in a magical ritual or spell can bring about fast magical results. All of the following magical “ palos ” come from the Brazilian Rain Forest and are used by practi-tioners from the magical religious traditions known as Macumba, Can-domble, Quimbanda, Palo Mayombe, Voodoo, Santeria and Umbanda. Magical “palos ” can be used in your magical spells in various forms. The individual “palos ” can be wrapped with the clothing of the target of your spell or can be added to “magic jar spells ” . “Powdered pa-los ” can be used as magic sprinkling powders and mixed with other magical ingredients to enhance your spell or even used in the prepara-tion of candle dressings. The “extract of palo ” can be used in combi-nation with other herbs and magical ingredients and used in a spiritual bath. “Pure oil essence palos ” can be used as candle dressings, to anoint candle and image dolls and even added to various spells.

The spirit signature sigils connect the spirits to our earthly realm. The spirit signature sigils when used in the appropriate magical manner open up the doors to world of the supernatural. They are used in divinatory practices. In Spanish they are called “Firmas ” and in Portuguese they are called “Pontos Riscados ”. The spirit sig-nature sigil itself when drawn out on the ground or drawn on an object will call forth the spirit. The spirit signature sigil also serves as a physi-cal focus through which the Congo magician achieves the desired state of mind. Spirit signature sigils represent the secret names of spirits and deities who manifest themselves differently to each magic practitioner. Once the Congo magician has summoned the spirit or deity he may control it, if necessary, by subjecting its sigil to fire or the use of a magi-cal sword or machete. Spirit signature sigils can also serve as amulets, talismans, or meditation tools. Congo spirit signature sigils may be of various signs, such as crosses, tridents, stars associated with different deities. Some of the best spirit sigils are attained through intuition and inspiration. Many come through meditation and the practice of scrying; when a certain pattern seems to appear upon the object which the indi-vidual is gazing at. Others believe symbols are occasionally mystically produced when asked for. Congo magicians often times inscribe the spirit signature sigil on ceremonial ritual objects, candles or objects of silver, brass, gold, or glass. Such spirit signatures sigils are considered to be magically powerful. Congo magicians also draw these very sacred and powerful spirit signature sigils directly on the ground in front of the Congo spirit nganga to invoke and to summon the deities to appear and to send them to do their bidding. The following Congo Spirit Signature Sigils ( F irmas ) can be used when making a spirit nganga, amulets, macuttos, candles, spells and rituals."},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"603 SPIRIT SIGNATURE FOR THE MONTENEGRO TEMPLO QUIM-BANDA ( AMERICAN CANDOMBLE CHURCH )"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"604 EXU MAIORAL"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"605 EXU REI"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"606 NZAMBI - GOD"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"607  LUCERO VIRA MUNDO"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"608  BRAZO FUERTE"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"609  LUCERO VIRA MUNDO"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"610  GURUNFINDA ( OZAIN )"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"611  TIEMPO VIEJO"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"612  MADRE DE AGUA"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"613  MAMA SHOLAN"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"614  TIEMBLA TIERRA"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"615  CABO RONDO"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"616  NSAMBA NTALA"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"617  KOBAYENDE"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"618  CENTELLE NDOKI"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"619  SIETE RAYOS"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"620  ZARABANDA"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"621 CALDERO ESPIRITUAL"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"622 PRENDA JUDIA"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"623  LUCERO REI DO CONGO"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"624  LUCERO VENCE BATALLA"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"625  LUCERO VIRA MUNDO"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"626 LUCERO DO CEMETERIO"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"627  LUCERO CALUNGA"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"628 CALUNGA"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"629 MAMA SHOLAN GUENGUE BRILLUMBA CONGO ACABA EN LO PROFUNDO DEL RIO"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"630 TEMPO"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"631 JUREMA VENCE BATALLA"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"632  LUCERO FOR THE CALDERO ESPIRITUAL"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"633 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT SIETE RAYOS"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"634 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT MADRE DE AGUA"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"635  LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT MAMA SHOLAN GUENGUE DEL RIO SECO & LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT MAMA SHOLAN GUENGUE BRILLUMBA CONGO ACABA CUENTA EN LO PROFUNDO DEL RIO "},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"636 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT CENTELLE NDOKI"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"637 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT ZARABANDA"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"638 LUCERO FOR THE PRENDA JUDIA"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"639 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT TEMPO"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"640 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT KOBAYENDE"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"641 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT TIEMBLA TIERRA"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"642 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT BRAZO FUERTE"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"643 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT CABO RONDO & LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT JUREMA VENCE BATALLA"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"644 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT NSAMBA NTALA"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"645 LUCERO FOR THE SPIRIT TIEMPO VIEJO"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"646 CEMETERY RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"647 FOREST RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"648 RAILROAD RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"649 RIVER RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"650 MOUNTAIN RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"651 FIELD RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"652  OCEAN RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"653  AJE SPIRITS"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"654 EGGUN SPIRITS"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"655 EGGUN SPIRITS"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"656 A DIAGRAM SHOWING THE PLACES WHERE THE RAYADO MARKS MUST GO.

Santería is a system of be-liefs that merge the Yoruba religion ( brought to the New World by slaves imported to the Caribbean and to other parts of Latin America as well to work the sugar plantations ) with Roman Catholic and Native American traditions. These slaves carried with them various religious traditions, including a tradition of a trance for communicating with their ancestors and deities, various sacred rituals to petition God and the practice of sacred drumming. Santería a term meaning the worshiping of Saints, has become a common name for the religion. The term Santero ( a ) i s used to describe a Priest or Priestess replacing the traditional term Olorixa as an extension of the deities. The Orixas became known as the Saints in image of the Catholic pantheon. The most well known Orixas are; Eleggua, Og-gun, Oshun, Shango, Oya, Obatala, Yemaya and Orunla. These are the most common Orixa names, especially in the Caribbean and Brazil. The Priests are known as Baba-lorixas, \"Fathers of Orixa\", and Priestess as Iyalorixas, \"Mothers of Orixa ”."},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"738 QUIMBANDA INITIATIONS DISCOVER THE HIDDEN POWER TO UNLOCK THE MAGICAL MYSTERIES WWW.PALOMAYOMBE.ORG"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"739 BOTANICA PAPA MONTENEGRO ’S OCCULT SHOP AUTHENTIC HANDMADE OCCULT PRODUCTS & SUPPLIES WWW.PAPAMONTENEGRO.COM"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"740 AMERICAN CANDOMBLE CHURCH We are preserving the Sacred Mysteries of the Universe P.O.
