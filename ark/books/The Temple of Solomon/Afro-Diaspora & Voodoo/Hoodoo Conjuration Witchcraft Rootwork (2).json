An index being prepared by the CenteP foP the Study of CompaPative FoZkZoPe and Mythology -University of California, Los Angeles -will necessi­tate volume five. The CenteP previously had indexed my FoZkZoPe fPOm Adams County IZZinois, 2nd ed. , 1965 . Between the appearance of volumes one and two in April 1970, and present volume three near the end of 1973, two experiences of personal importance happened: fir st, after years of absence, I returned to field work, the actual collecting of folklore among people themselves; and sec­ond, I became acquainted on three occasions with leaders in the folklore world. Both experiences deserve a few words. The third week of April 1970, volumes one and two of Hoodoo came from the press. A few days later I left by automobile for Florida. If I were to attempt volumes three and four , I would need not only a rest but also a renewed acquaint­ance and understanding of my living sources -an incentive to continue. These, I felt, could be obtained only by returning to field work. A tape recorder went with me. St. Petersburg was a wise choice, psychologically perfect. Here I had re­started my folklore-collecting career in 1939, after that experience with the Memphis police (v.l,p. XXXIV; for attitude towards police, see letter to Edward Bufford at end of v.2 ). Here also my wife had been with me (p. XXXIV}. How the city had changed! The spacious Gulf of Mexico beach had disappeared in the clut­ter of real estate development, so had the little vegetab le farms on the way to it. The bay area on the inland side had become a megalopolis. As a field work­er, always sensitive to my surroundings, I felt depressed . During my resting period I occasionally practiced with tape recorder, but always my eyes watched for the man wanted. While in a repair shop, something having happened to my tape recorder, I became interested in a cassette recorder for the first time. Its battery power fascinated me. I could interview a person anywhere. If only I had had such a machine years ago! There and then I made the great decision. The purchase of the cassette recorder having depleted my traveler checks, I went down to my bank to purcha se new ones. As I was entering the bank, I saw a Yellow Cab standing in front of it. A short fat man, middle-aged and white, sat in the driver' s seat. I asked how much it would cost to drive about the city for an hour. He answered $6. 00. \"If you are still here when I come out,\" I said, \"I'll ride with you.\" The time had come for someone to drive me through the old black district so that freed from driving I could study it. My business in the bank took longer than expected because the cashier wasbusy. To him only could I deliver a letter from my Cincinnati bank permitting me tocash their checks in the St. Petersburg bank. The cashier of course had previously received inst ructions from Cincinnati. All this took time. Yet when I left the bank, that Yellow cab was still there! I went over to it, leaned down and was about to say, \"Let's go.\" The driver was a black man! Young, clean-cut nice­looking -light-b rown actually (ILL. 3). But let Mr. Clarence Cuppy, ex-para­trooper of South Vietnam, describe our first meeting to my new cassette recorder: [My voice.] (MP. Cuppy .. hePe-'s the micPophone.) Thank you .. MP. Hyatt. The otheP day on Wednesday [May 27, 1970], when I met"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"II -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -�. Hyatt in front of the First National Bank - and immediately I recognized that he was a clergyman - he asked me about taking him around town for about an hour. Upon getting into the cab he began to talk about folklore� and then ex­plained to me about his interest in folklore. I started to tell him about the story of a gentleman who used to live not too far from me� about a hundred yards from where I live [from where.he and I were talking ]. a Mr. Hewett Dixon. EVery­one considered him a root doctor. etc. [The complete story will appear in volume four.] Mr. Cuppy omitted one important matter. I told him that back in 1939 I had collected folklore at the Clark Hotel (ILL.B; also v.l1p. XXXV1 line 3) for the blacks of Memphis Town - a black district of St. Petersburg. Was the building still standing? Yes1 but it had been condemned several years ago and was falling into ruin. Then1 after 31 years I learned it was not Memphis Town but Methodist Town. What an impr ession that Memphis epi sode must have made on my mind! All this new St. Petersburg mater ial. 135-150 pages of it1 will appear and be explained in volume four. Here1 however I will identify the other illustrations from St. Petersburg. Near the same automobile and in front of the same house1 Cuppy takes a picture (ILL.5) of me and the Prophet Warkiee Sarheed1 the latter wearing a pink turban he calls his seeing and hearing hat. Wearing this ha t and under proper condi­tions he can see the unseeable and hear the unbearable. I interviewed him five times in five different houses. reminding me of Hamlet's stage business of hop­ping about the stage to confuse the ghost below. He heads a commune of twelve separate homes. In illustrations 19 I reproduce his business carq1 and in 22 a letter written to him by a patient or client - a rare document. the only one I have ever seen. Bishop Womack and I (ILL.6)1 his arm about me1 stand at the side of his Temple Bus. We are on his own large plot of land with a commodius house to our right. He too has a commune. the reverse of The Prophet's. People he has healed live with him. One of these patients. appear ing with him and me in an unpublished photograp h. will tell us about his cure during the Bishop's interview in volume four. Rumor considers the Bishop a former doctor. At least as a healer he wa s acquainted with hoodoo rites and symptoms and psychosomatic disorders. This interview from a veteran of World War II1 describing his life and philosophy. is an amazing document. Its content. spontaneity and sincerity could make it a masterpiece! Mrs. Davis1 a healer and I (ILL.7) are standing outside her home1 a house next door to Cuppy's. He takes this photograph. We hold a spirit picture. a design revealed to her in a dream or vision. The medium is colored glass from broken bottles. but the red-yellow-blue rainbow ordinary paint. The special details about this unusual creation. as well as other wonders. she will narrate in volume four. The gray automobile in preceding photographs is author's. Illustration 8 is the old Clark Hotel at Methodist Town1 described in pre­ceding paragraph 6. During my collecting days back in 1939 there was an upper porch1 as you can see from the three second-floor doors leading out upon it1 and a roof over it. My interviewing room was on the second floor1 sur ely to the rear. When I worked in a hotel I always paid my rent each day. I will now describe the three occasions mentioned in the opening paragraph of this Introduction. Occasion one beg ins: Dr. Wayland D. Hand in 1972 invited me to attend the folklore section of the annual meeting of the Southern California Academy of Science (ILL.27). This meeting would be held in early May at the University of California. Los Angeles. He had asked me several times in previous years to examine his great Index. which"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Roo twork -III included FolkloPe fPom Adams County Illinois, but too involved with Hoodoo I could never get away. That non-stop flight from St. Louis to Los Angeles, my first airplane, was an awesome adventure. He met me at the airport. First, he introduced me to the famous freeway as far as Santa Monica, where he turned off to pass his house and continue on to the Marina. His invitation had offered me his home or the University Guest House. I chose the latter as more conven­ient for everyone. Did we eat at the Marina? Finally and early I bedded down in the Guest House. Next morning I had coffee, fruit and pastry in the living room of our Guest House hostess. The Guest House does not provide meals. Dr. Hand soon came by. We walked a short distance to the CenteP foP the Study of CompaPative FolkloPe and MYthology in Ralph Bunche Hall (usually shortened to Bunche), he a graduate of U.C.L.A. Here at the CenteP I had an opportunity to examine an unusual folk­lore library, especially rich in magazines, and also to dip into the vast files of the Index. Equally interesting were assis tants and students as they entered and were introduced. Came noon I was ready to eat, but first a chore had to be performed by our walking back to the Guest House. Yes, University Police had ticketed Dr. Hand' s automobile! Only a guest may park at the Guest House. He moved his car to a nearby street. We had luncheon at the Professors Club, the food being excellent. Each time we ate there I, now an inlander, concentrated on the excellent fresh fish. Friday I attended the morning and afternoon folklore lectures and discuss ions, receiving between the two sessions a delightful surpris e. A man back at the CenteP waited to have luncheon with us -\"Jackie\" Starkey! As soon as I learned from him that he knew my books, was an old Trinity College Dublin man, and heard from Dr. Hand that Starkey had been at Abbey Theatre for years, a torrent of words began to fall . We talked across several streets and at the entrance to the Professors Club did an Alphonse-Gaston routine; he to my age, I to his brilliant career and unusual personality. Dr. Hand stopped this defer ence contest by en­tering first and asking us to follow. Here was a man related to James Sullivan Starkey, the Irish poet, founder of the Theatre of Ireland and the Dublin Magazine. I told Starkey my wife and I had read much of the Irish Renaissance literature, had attended several plays at Abbey Theatre, long since gone up in flames. On our first sight of the building, outside and inside, it was difficult to grasp that immortality resided within its walls. Yes, sitting opposite me was a man who had personally known Lady Gregory, Yeats and other notable persons, including George Moore; which reminds me, if I can find it: DeaPest� Neil House� Columbu� Ohio Wednesday� May 11th� 1921 The situation looks very pPomising ••• I have told you befoPe� the LoPd somehow always seems to be with us ••• BefoPe I foPget it� one of the men at ahUPah is an editoP of a Columbus newspapeP.

It was the only photograph I had had taken in years, and just two copies at that, all I could afford; one for Mrs. Altenberg, the future Mrs. Hyatt, and the other for my parents. After 1920 I was called Henry by almost everyone. The photograph in clericals can be seen at the end of Folklore fram Adams County Illinois, second edition. Sorry for this intrusion of my wife, but she and I had been in Los Angeles in 1938, also in San Francisco, which I was soon to visit. There were rich memories from both places. Besides, these two cities were a part of my forgetting the recent Memphis episode (see v.l, Intro. p.XXXIV, lines lQ-42). Friday night, Dr. and Mrs. Wayland D. Hand gave me a reception in their modern home, spacious, beautifully designed, and furnished with rare taste. Here I met a hostess as gracious as my host. The guests were special too, all from the folklore world. How many were there? Thirty-five? Not everyone I had previous­ly met had been invited. I no longer remember names, there or anywhere else, un­less I take them down, but among those present were Dr. D.K. Wilgus, President of the American Folklore Society, and his wife. After an abundance of excellent food, drink, and conversation, most of us sat down, I in the center of a large setee with a tape recorder in front of me and its operator at my side. I, sit­ting, spoke briefly about why I began to collect folklore, gave a few experiences, and then asked for questions. To me the occasion was memorable. Saturday I again attended the morning and afternoon sessions of lectures and discussions. During the afternoon I remember being the center of attention on two occasions: (1) A young lady born in Finland and a Roman Catholic, who was lecturing, looked towards me and said she would be embarrassed to explain the next Finnish custom, because it contained some words not proper to use in front of a priest. She thought I, an Episcopalian, was a Roman Catholic priest. Some­one in the audience- surely Inkeri Rank of U.C.L.A., who knew Hoodoo-told her to go ahead, I would not be shocked. (2) Unexpectedly at the very end I took the chair to say a few words and invite questions. The preceding speaker had been so interesting I began by asking her a question! This gave me a moment to adjust to the novel situation in which I suddenly found myself. The day had been long, and since an evening activity would soon follow, I stopped my part of the action after fifteen minutes. The real chairman then declared the meeting ended. All speakers were excellent. One in particular I liked because he was the only high-school teacher to speak. For his course on folk song he played records and lectured. Here at the Quincy Library students frequently ask for FACI 2nd ed. Notre Dame, Catholic High School for girls, began long ago to use FACI 1st ed as a reference book. Years before when I attended 8th grade we had a delightfully written book on Greek mythology enjoyed by all of us. Surely our own living folklore with new beliefs being created daily would also be appreciated. What a collecting force these youngsters could become! That night the Academy of Sciences for Southern California held its annual banquet. Prizes were given, scholarships awarded, and experts spoke - one of the latter a nationally known ecologist. I sat next to a young man, a biologist, working on fish scales. Showing him a few scales on my hands, I suggested he might some day come up with a healing remedy. Surely, I theorized, my ailment could have come from my ancestors, the fish. I mean real fish, not Pisces my Zodiac sign (ILL.31). When I offered that theory to my dermatologist he made a gesture meaning let a hoodoo man stick to his hoodoo. Despite my rejection as a scientist, let me say this. Since June 1970 in Florida, when I ate a piece of half-spoilt fish, I have worn gloves! For the first two years, light weight, loosely knitted, white cotton gloves; for the third year, and only at night,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -v plastic gloves over a liquid on my hands to make them sweat -not perspire. My ailment is under control but not cured, and it is not catching. Since there was no Guest House hostess on Sunday, Dr. Hand brought me break­fast; a large roll sandwich with ground ham and other mixtures inside (deli­cious!), a container of coffee, and several apples, the latter in a sack. I was already downstairs with my two bags waiting for him, the key to my room on one of them so that he personally could return it to the proper place. Having plenty of time to catch my eight o'clock plane, I had breakfast in that very reserved parking lot of the University Guest House. Later, as I was about to board the plane, I remembered the television advertisement his wife and I had joked about: Please tell MPs. Hand, \"I ate the whole thing.\" Fifty-five minutes to San Francisco ! Again I was among memories. My wife and I in 1938, after Memphis, had crossed Canada from Toronto, driven down the Pacific Coast as far as Mexico, Tijuana, and then retraced our route back to Los Angeles. Here we took trains to Grand Canyon, Albuquerque (automobile to Santa Fe and Taos), Chicago and New York. We had all sorts of adventures, the craziest of them my wife's insisting upon us staying awake two hours, so that we could stand a few minutes in the clattering and chilly outside vestibule of the Pullman, to watch passing by the three or four lights of Medicine Hat, Canada! The name and place had intrigued her since girlhood. She had already seen a real medicine hat, that of DoctoP E.D. England, M.A., Famous Mentalist (see Illustra­tions at end of v.2 ). Wha t would she have said about The Prophet's pink seeing and heaPing hat (ILL.5) ! I was met at the airport by friends from San Jose, Mr. & Mrs . Joy P. Birdsley, sister and brother-in-law of the Pogges (ILL.4 & 25). They, having lived in San Francisco, gave me the complete outdoor tour of this fascinating world city . From 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. , I looked at city and bay , always aware of the latter even when not in sight, until we sat down to an excellent luncheon on Fishermen's Wharf. Finally the Birdsleys returned me to my hotel. At Denver my cousin Wana came down from Wyoming to be with me several days. She is a rancher as well as presently president of the state's retired teacher's association. Her two glorious pictures among the illustrations at the end of FolkloPe fPom Adams County Illinois, 2nd ed. , speak for themselves. The day after her departure I took a bus tour down to the United States Airforce Academy and up Pikes Peak . Next day I flew to St. Louis and Quincy. Occasion two -mentioned in the opening paragraph of this Introduction -now follows: Illustrations 23 and 24 explain how I happened to attend the annual meeting of the American Folklore Society at the University of Texas at Austin. For thefirst time I had to make two airplane changes, one at St. Louis and the other atDallas. At the latter place a kind gentleman, William E. Brown, of McGraw Hill Publishing Co. , seeing me wandering about, asked, \"Father, could I help you?\" I explained I was hunting for the Austin gate, also that I was an Episcopalian father. \"Good,\" he replied, \"I sang in the future Bishop Hines' choir when he was a rector here in Texas.\" Well, he bought me a drink, sat with me on the way to Austin, and let me out of his taxi at Villa Capri Hotel. The latter, an extensive and well-equipped establishment is just across a boulevard from the President Lyndon B. Johnson Memorial Library and the Joe C. Thompson Center. I registered at the Center before the first three simultaneous sessions began and then, inst ead of selecting one of the three sessions, sat down in the Lobby to wait for the appearance of my host Dr. Richard M. Dorson , and to watch the many reg istrants. More than 450 persons registered . They came from every American state and Canadian province, and many foreign countries.

Dr. Richard M. Dorson, President of the Fellows, introduced me and read several letters from Quincy, Ill inois. He had prepared me for the letters by asking my permission to read them. How the Mayor of Quincy, and Carl Landrum, the Historian of Quincy, and Caroline Sexauer, Librarian, speaking for herself as well as the Board of Directors and the Staff of the Public Library -how these three persons knew I was in Texas perplexed me. It was not until I returned to Quincy that I dis­covered the culprit (ILL.25) . To have been invited to this annual luncheon as guest of honor was a rare recognition indeed . After the aft ernoon sessions, on reaching my hotel room I found flowers and three telegrams; the latter from the Pogges, Xerox and IBM regional representa­tives. The flowers puzzled me. Then I saw the small corner of something pro­truding from under the container. The card read ManpoweP� Ina.� Jane & John [Ray]. I began to suspect the name of the Quincy culpr it. Saturday night brought the annual banquet of the American Folklore Society. preceded by a cocktail party, both in the Regency Room of the Villa Capri. While I was standing there watching the crowd gather and drink , here came an attractive young lady with whom I had talked several times previously, Lydia Fish. You will find her name on the preceding Thursday schedule of lectures, the afternoon session FOLKLORE AND THE EROTIC. I was delighted to learn that folklorists had not only discovered sex but also were talking about it openly. Volume 3 of Hoodoo would contain a considerable amount of sexual mater ial, beliefs and rites long delaying the publication of Hoodoo. Well, I boughtLydia a drink. Later, she seeing some friends with whom she was eating, I moved over to the buffet around which people had started to gather. The food looked and vas delicious. I filled my plate. Where would I sit? Were tables reserved? Then I saw the very man who could help me, the Secretary, Prof. Kenneth S. Goldstein of the University of Pennsylvania. To my question about sitting any­where, he replied, \"No! No! You are sitting at the head table.\" He may have said dais, I no longer remember . In any case I was amazed . As you look at the head table I went up and took the end seat to the right. There were about twelve seats. I had been eating about five minutes when Dr. Dorson came up and sat beside .e. My dinner companion he explained, would be a Lady from London, the Secre­tary of the English Folklore Society. He thought we would have many things in common to talk about. There would be several other persons from foreign coun­�ries. As soon as eating ended and the meeting opened, the master of ceremonies would introduce the guests of honor. He, Dr. Dorson , had asked for the special privilege of introducing me, and that was the reason I would be introduced last. Bo, he was not sitting at the table of honor but down there, a table just below us. Well, the Lady from London and I had many things to discuss. Did the train still run from Oxford to Paddington, I asked? \"Yes,\" she answered. My wife and I used to think that sixty miles in sixty minutes was the greatest ride on earth �o London remember; not to Oxford! And how Americans avoided London back intho� days. As soon as the boat docked at Cherbourg or Le Havre, nine-tenths of the passengers disembarked to rush up to Paris. Today in London, throw a stick and you'll hit an American! The gavel sounded, the master of ceremonies was about to introduce the guests of honor. Quickly each guest was introduced, briefly hands were clapped , while in�roducee sat there trying to look pleasant. Then we were informed that Dr. tichard M. Dorson would introduce the last guest. He came to the podium, said"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"X -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -a few words about my books ••• the whole thing happened in a few minutes . I was stunned, absolutely stunned! Everyone in the Regency Room, even those at the high table, was standing and clapping. I had received an ovation! Eventually I found myself on an Ozark plane to St. Louis. Approaching the city we ran into a terrific rainstorm. We would move· along slowly, then drop down a few feet and move along slowly again. It was like walking down steps, putting both feet on each step . Suddenly we were below the clouds, the ground looked very near to me, an unexperienced air traveler. The pilot made a beau­tiful landing . And then I heard the man behind me talking to the woman with him: I neveP thought we wouZd make it: Several months later , this spring or summer, the Ozark did no t make it. It was the worst plane disaster ever to happen in St. Louis. To catch the plane for Quincy I had fifteen minutes. That airport in St. Louis is a confusing place, but I made the connection. Every seat had been taken ex­cept the one next to me. A man's voice said, \"Father, may I sit next to you?\" I answered, \"Delighted!\" Then, as always, I explained that I am an Episcopalian priest retired . To his question about my destination, I replied Quincy. He gave me the bad news. Conditions in Quincy were bad, I would probably be compelled to continue on with him to Burlington, Iowa. Meanwhile why no t relax and have a drink with him . I accepted. We did land in Quincy, in a snowstorm and four inches of snow. I said goodbye to my companion, E.G. Sutherlin, vice president and plant manager of the Modern Welding Company, and walked carefully across the snow. It was cold. No one was outside except a few airfield employees . My niece met me. Oaaasion thPee -last of the oaaasions mentioned in the first paragraph of this Introduction - now beg ins: Dr. Wayland D. Hand in July, 1973, deciding to drive east to meet his speaking engagements in Indiana and Arkansas, stopped in Quincy to pick me up as a travel­ing companion. Since he had little time to spare and was a day late in arriving , we could no t put together a recep tion for him. The Pogges , including the two younger of their four daughters, Jean and Judi entertained. We invited only my other assistant Mrs. Harry Dyel and her husband. In Terre Haute we stayed at Indiana State University's Hulman Center, formerly a very large downtown hotel. As a special feature of the Center, the formerball­room had been converted into a summer theatre. The size of the university, 15,000 students and numerous buildings would later impress me. Besides , I did no t real­ize that Terre Haute had grown so large, past 80,000 inhabitants. Soon after arriving we drove out to the home of Dr. and Mrs. Roland L. Baker (ILL.2) to have dinner with them . The two-day sessions of the Hoosier's Folklore Society were a great success in attendance, speakers, and discussions . The final day everyone attended a luncheon downtown. The second and third nights Dr. Hand and I were again enter­tained by the Bakers, the last night being quite a party. Here once more I saw Howard Wright Marshall (ILL.2 ) and his wife, she a graduate of Stephens College, the only one of these much publicized girls I had ever seen. He by the way, a nat ive of Moberly , Mo., was almost a neighbor of mine. As an athlete he had played against Culver-Stockton College at Canton, Mo., which brings him even closer. Both he and his wife are musicians. Next morning Dr. Hand and I had breakfast at Hulman Center with Dr. and Mrs. Allen Walker Reed (ILL.2)1 and then drove, I mean tried to drive them to the airport. We were almost there when we lost our way and drove round in a circle before reaching our destination. After the airport we continued on to Blooming­ton, home of Indiana University."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -XI Later that afternoon we called upon Prof. and Mrs. W. Edson Richmond. The lat�er was the first woman senior warden I had ever met in the Episcopal Church! I told her that back in 1920-1921 in the Diocese of Southern Ohio three or four of us young clergymen had fought for the right of women to sit on the vestry. the diocesan convention ran the steamroller aver us. We were considered danger­ous radicals! The Richmonds, as well as the Roberts family met next day, were interested in Norwegian folklore. At one point in the conversation I reminisced about Oslo. My wife and I, while still residents of England, decided in the sa..er of 1925 to visit Oslo, Stockholm and Upsala, and Copenhagen. (As a matter of fact we would then continue on to Hamburg, Berlin - where I had been in 1923 -Paris, and back to Oxford.) I had never been in these three northern countries, chough they were known to Mrs. Hyatt. We left Newcastle upon Tyne in a 2000 ton boat for Oslo. It looked like a rowboat when compared to the trans-Atlantic l±oers BePengaPia and EmpPess of BPitian; and like a rowboat behind an oldtime s�eruvbeeler on the Mississippi River, our Newcastle boat bobbed up and down for 24 hours in an exceedingly rough North Sea. The only part of the voyage !enjoyed aaa breakfast the second morning while going up the Fiord to Oslo. Yes, I remem­bered Oslo very well: the streetcar or tram tracks passing the Opera House, this .a±n street continuing on towards the distant Royal Palace; the location of our �e1 vith its corner entrance to the restaurant; and the excellent restaurant apposite the University Library, the latter then a rather small building. At � latter restaurant we were served cooked whole, unopened immature peapods �th baby peas inside - in other words very unripe peapods, a delicacy! Were tbese peas still served? As on all our trips, we had an unusual experience. This aae happened the morning our night express from Warsaw to Berlin to Paris reached tbe border of France. We were awakened by shouting outside our compartment win­dow. The commotion continued for about a hour, delaying our train. A young man ta i&rsaw, Poland, had tied himself under the train beneath our future compart­�� and had ridden that way with only the brief stop in Berlin, where we boarded tbe train. This was an incredible feat of endurance! Moreover an amazing coin­cidence had occurred the night before. While this Pol� was riding and suffering �th the train, only a foot or so beneath my feet, I chanced to be reading a P..raee classic in which the author discusses the suffering of Jesus for the sins af .an. He could neither understand the purpose nor the ethics of such suffering. I was t.pressed by his objections. The name of the author I am unable to remem­� a� the moment. This book, a classic for many years when I bought it, will be taaad in the bibliography of the original GOlden Bough. Normally I did not carry � .e such a serious book. Usually on the continent I picked up at any rail­� ·��ion something from the Tauchnit2 Edition: collection of BPitish and Am­� AuthoPs, a paperback selling for about 10¢. I have one in front of me now: �ise Bierce, In the �dSt of Life, vol.2814, bought in 1923. In Paris we wrrended the fascinating French Colonial Exposition, the feature of which was a �sized replica of the facade of the Angkor Wat OP Vat. The food in the &E8taazants of the Exposition was outstanding, food that no longer is served to � pablic. That reminds me - we had refreshments at the Richmonds. a.e1yuue calls her Linda nJgh, though she is a professor and an author well­, a in the folklore world.

No one left the party, a tremendous succ ess, until 11 P.M. Next morning we had a substantial breakfast with Prof. and Mrs. Warren Roberts, she cooking the pancake part of the meal on a small stand near her. We ate in an outdoor living room or Florida room . Here as everywhere I enjoyed the conversa­tion. A real surprise came just as we were leaving and had been taken into the formal living room. Prof. Roberts was a skilled cabinet maker! He had made the period furniture we were looking at. All these folklore people at Indiana I found interesting. Unfortunately Dr. Richard M. Dorson, Director of the Folklore Institute, was in England. On leaving the Roberts we drove to Columbus, Indiana to see Prof. Stith Thomp­son, one of the earlier persons interested in folklor e. He and his wife, living at the Four Seasons Retirement Home, had invited us down to luncheon. I had never seen a retirement home quite so large, so modern, and so well arranged. The dining room was formal, a large square, perhaps a story and a half high, and well lighted by windows. All visitors ate in a central square lighted by a glass dome. This permitted residents to leave occasionally their own tables or to see other guests. We had quite a walk along halls to reach the Thompson ap artment, where we sat outside on a screened porch looking out upon open country. Here the Thompsons were near Indiana University, their former home. By the way, those halls had a purpose; walking exercise and recreation. Each hall turned before reach ing its normal end , thus leaving a large cubicle with comfortable chairs and several tables, where a tired walker could rest or a group of per sons could meet for conversation or games. From Columbus we returned to Terre Haute to pick up Interstate 70, a modern divided highway that eased our way across Illinois to St. Louis, Mo. As we had feared, the evening rush hour caught us near East St. Louis. We were soon among the automobiles backed up for miles trying to reach and cross the Mississippi River bridge that unloads in St. Louis near Busch Statium . Worse, there were no traffic signs indicating proper lanes! Not one policeman -standing, on motor­cycle, in automobile -did we see. I had not been in such a traffic jam for years. Finally we are out of the traffic jam but driving in the wrongdirection! Three times we had to ask at service stations how to reach Holiday Inn, North, the one near the airport. I was tired, my arthritic bones ached. Could I con­tinue on to Arkansas? The following morning I continued on to Arkansas. Vance Randolph I had to meet! Soon after my arrival in Fayetteville, I learned that Mts. Vance Randolph, the former Mary Celestie Parler, was a folklore collector and an outstanding per­son in her own right, one of the treasures of the University of Arkansas. To have missed them both would have been a serious misfortune. As folklorists they lived in a building appropriately named -Skull Creek Apartments! Dr. Hand and I, guests of the Randolphs, stayed in a nearby apartment building. Each morning we had breakfast in the Randolph ap artment, a meal prepared by a graduate student who cooked and served. So impressed was I that later I wrote to the Randolphs: Those breakfasts with the Randolphs, food and conversation, could anything have been more delightful? Such breakfasts I have not had in years. Food? You know a clergyman is writing this. EVen attending the Episcopal church with you and Dr. Wayland D. Hand was an event. Please e�tend my greetings to the Rector, I liked him. Dr. Hand gave two university lectures, one during the day to Mrs. Randolph's class of folklore students; the other, next night in a university lecture theater open to the public. As we were leaving the theater a young man approached me saying he had always wanted to meet me , \"I am Wayne D. McGinnis,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -XIII a fellow countryman from Adams County, Illinois-from Ursa!\" This was my last surprise for the trip. Next morning Dr. Hand started on his drive back to Cali­fornia. I accompanied him as far as Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I took an airplane to St. Louis and, because the Ozark Air Line was on strike , an automobile to Quincy. That eight -day trip with Dr. Hand had been one of the great adventures of my life! I was tired , dead tired . Not in years had I been so physically and men­tally involved, except with Hoodoo. Having finished the three oaaasions of paragraph one of the Introduction, I must now complete the identification of the remaining illustrations -numbers 9-17. Mrs. Alfred F. Pogge's letter (ILL.25) about my devotion to the completion of Hoodoo caused the inclusion of illustrations 9-17, pictures of my wife's and my final home at the edge of the village Gladstone, New Jersey. Here I finished the second edition of FoZkZoPe fPom Adams County IZZinois and decided to do something about those cartons of hoodoo material in the garage (ILL.9, 15) . Originally we purchased the Gladstone property about 1948 as a weekend retreat from the noise and dirt of New York City, but we moved in permanently three years before my wife's death in 1963 . Through the years we remodeled and landscaped this double farmhouse. It was bought from St. Bernard's School, then college preparatory for boys, now Gills-St. Bernards for girls and boys. Their property and two public roads surrounded us, except our three acres across Mendham Road (ILL.9, 10, 15, 17). To the south of the house and towards the village is Church Street, called \"The Gladstone Road ,. in FaiP is Ouzo Land (ILL.l7). Church Street, only 1/4 mile long , ends at the top of the photograph where Mendham Road crosses it. Beyond the latter road and among the trees and over to the house spread our p receding three acres (ILL.l7). As we stand behind an L-shaped counter (ILL.ll) having four electric burners under a stainless-steel hood, we can see the top of a table against the triple window, a window visible also in outside views (ILL.9, 16) . To the left is my seat, to the right my wif e's, and towards the counter a third -all armchairs. Two objects appear on the table, a hurricane lamp holding a square red candle half-burnt, and to its left and lying flat, a black-bound springbinder containing a part of the typed manuscript of FoZkZoPe fPom Adams County IZZ�nois, 2nd ed. That bulge to the extreme right happens to be a Chinese cloisonne vase on a high teakwood stand. Out through the window we could watch birds at our busy feeding station, see both the circular drive with its entranc e from Mendham Road (ILL.l5) and part of the walk to the front door (ILL.l6), and therefore observe traffic passing by on Mendham Road or Church Street, or anyone approaching the house. You will now understand why after my wife's death I deserted my study to write at the table. Our backs to the triple window we face the former L-shaped counter and a similarly shaped counter with sink and coffeepot (ILL.l2). Between thesecounters runs a passageway through the door on the left, partly visible under the hood, to a rear exit and powder room . A large refrigerator intrudes on the far right. IOtice those convenient drawers facing the table. Finally we gaze through a doorless door, across the back-from-the-road part of a long living room , and out the corner picture window (ILL.lO). Beyond or to the north is another acre of oar land which adjo ined St. Bernard's annual horseshow ground, and in the dis­t&Dce the far-off hills up Pleasant Valley. Left of our acre or to the wes t, but GD school property, we could see a small swamp, home of redwing blackbird, and the bordering trout stream visited occasionally by great blue heron fishing, and frequently by killdeer (plover) repeatedly crying kiZZdeeP. Beyond, still to the .._t and dominating the landscape, rose the steeple of St. Bernard's Chapel. All"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"XIV -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -this we saw from the corner picture window1 inc luding deer early in morning or late in evening coming down from the hills to drink; bats and fireflies; sunsets1 rainstorms . and blizzards. That corner picture window can also be found among illustrations at the end of Folklo�e f�om Adams County Illinois. 2nd ed. 1 where my wife and I are sitting in it. Now we are in the corner pic ture window glancing back through the \"dinekit\" (dining-room kitchen) at the triple window (ILL.l3). Near the top of the door notice the aluminum spotlight in the cei ling over the counter. That light is turned on1 by the way; you can see it shining on and over the edge of the counter. These pho tographs were taken in 1964 without flashlight or time exposure. Three objects rest on the piano; a fairly large oriental rug1 a part of which hangsover into the doorframe foreground; an intricately carved piece of bamboo on teakwood ' stand; and that small bulge which is another piece of Chinese cloisonne1 a very large bowl. All these oriental pieces1 some unseen and unmentioned we bought year s before in London at various times. If while in the corner pic ture window we turn slightly to the left1 we will be peeking through our Chinese sa�een into the other half1 the towards-the-public­road half of the living room (ILL.l4). This unusual and exotic screen is what remained after my neighbor and helper1 Edward J. Zimmerman and I removed the door and wall1 excluding studs1 between the former farmhouse parlor and kitchen-dining room. Those unplaned oversized studs are not the skimpy modern 2\"x4\"' s.

This scene in sepia was among a choice of several the Chevrolet Automobile Company asked their dealers to buy and disp lay. I bought mine through my local dealer about 1960 -the price $25. It is consider ed a great rural snow scene . That open front door shows the glass­louvered porch (ILL.91 101 16). Perhaps I should add here1 that up under the eaves at each corner of the house was a spotlight turned on before dark. Even during the night we lived in a circle of light. Speaking of light1 here I should shed a little more of it upon the purpose and nature of these volumes called HOODOO -CONJURATION -WITCHCRAFT -ROOTWORK1 an unwieldly title I have reduced for reference purposes to Hoodoo rather than the pos sib le but clumsy HCWR. As I have said somewhere. my Fo lklo�e f�om Adams County Illinois -abbreviated FACI in references -was a collection of general folklore in a small community. What I planned for my next investigation would be based upon the common magic rite of reversing-do the opposite. Instead of thegeneral folklore of FACI1 I would limit my subject matter to witchcraft1 only a part of general folklore1 collect it over a wide territory. and conf-ine my informants to black people. While narrowing the inquiry we must remember two facts: (1) Witch­craft itself is a vast and complicated field of study1 and (2) white people also believe what you will read in Hoodoo (see v.l1 Intro. pp. II-IV; also p.41 line 23; p.4751 line 41; p.5731 line 7; p.8941 line 34; p.8961 line 27; p.8971 line 24; p.l3231 line s 41-43; p.l8701 line 40; p.l909 1 line 39; and elsewhere.) Why did I limit Hoodoo to black people? (1) What little hoodoo I gathered among the blacks of Adams County Illinois was not enough to indicate much of any­thing. (2) I wanted to collec t down the Atlantic Coast so that my wife could be with me occasionally (see v.l1 Intro. p.XV1 paragraph 5) and this meant Southern States. At this time1 19361 I doubted whether I could work among blacks and whites simultaneously as I had done in Quincy1 Adams County1 Illinois. Remember1 all my collecting among blacks of the South occurred in the homes or hotels of blacks. (3) I theorized that blacks1 with less educational opportunities than whites1 would preserve more witchcraft traditions and current practices."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -XV (4) Blacks were chosen beaause of their speaial aonaentration in or near aities, or in aountry di stPiats (see v.l, p.XV, par.6) . (5) My preliminary experience with those first ten informants, interviewed in my New York City study, indicated that witchcraft could be found in the South. Besides, I already knew fairly well Maryland and Virginia, where I would begin field work, many of my ancestors having come from those states. Witchcraft or hoodoo is a complex belief and practice involving almost every aspect of life. Nothing ever happens naturally. If you become lame, someone planted a POot for you to walk over; if you have a headache, someone is burning a candle against you; if you are unlucky when gambling, someone ha s a stronger hand (a magic helper or good-luck p iece) than yours; if your business is bad, someone has dropped a �essed art icle in your place; etc. Witchcraft or hoodoo is a magic rite -whether acted out according to a formula or merely intended or wished-against someone's welfare. The victim or his doator uses a counter magic rite for cure or protection. Witchcraft concerns a person's spirit. To understand witchcraft a person must be familiar with the spiritlore upon which it is based. I have summarized the situation as follows: To aatah a spiPit, or to proteat your spiPit against the aatahing, or to release your aaught spiPit, this is the aomplete theory and praatiae of hoodoo (Hoodoo, p.24, lines 16-17). In addition to the spirit basis of hoodoo or witchcraft, we must remember that the Name of God , the Three Holy Names, the PsaLms, holy water, blessed candles, altars, and other Christian elements have been added. Hoodoo is a religion for many believers. Even so, we must realize that not every believer in hoodoo believes the same thing, or believes with the same intensity. This of course is also true of Christians. No two doators are alike. A convention of doators would be amazed by the amount and variety of material in these volumes of Hoodoo. This aorpus hoodooensis of mine is not like the laws of the Medes and Persians ahangeth not. Hoodoo is an amorphous body of rites and substances continually changing. Not all the matter I discovered a generation ago would be found today. Even then c ommercialism, other isms, and modern forces had been watering down for years the older witchcraft. Today, the modern revival of witchcraft in many forms, openly practiced and widely publicized , will add confusion to a field already confused . I need not say that this conglomeration of material was difficult to grasp and handle. I wasted two years of my life shuffling rites about, trying to establish a semblance of order. Even worse, what could I do about the sexual rites I began to discover 35 years ago! Back in 1936 many sexual terms commonly used -freely today were unpr intable and unspeakable. Consequently I felt obliged to separate .any of these rites from their interviews. As a result, later I had to restore some, not all, of this deleted material to its or iginal interview. Another waste of time! In the end my attitude had to be, preserve the material by publication. aDd let someone else or other persons do the arrangement and commentary. Hoodoo therefore is an archive to be studied, a quarry to be used in research, and not a logical presentation of special subject matter. Nonetheless, I hope the intelligent general reader will also discover Hoodoo and browse in it. Bet­ter for his or her benefit, maybe in the future the cream of Hoodoo can be re­duced to a manageable one volume. In addition to the preceding characteristics of Hoodoo I must also emphasize aaother important one, the professional worker called doator and other names. Strange, I never heard of a woman being called doator. Today, perhaps she is. After I had int erviewed 371 persons, I found in Richmond, Va., my first real dOctor (p. 933f). More doators followed him immediately. By the time I left"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"�I - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -Norfolk, Va., I would no longer hunt primarily for magic rites, but living men and women who kept the hoodoo system alive. Always I sought the doctor, his appearance, personality, mannerisms, origin of his power, possible descent from a predecessor, activities, beliefs, methods, special devices, and the atmosphere surrounding him. This latter also meant a study of his clients. Naturally I still welcomed anyone having information pertinent to my search. Information, accurate and reliable, was the very essence of that preceding search. Several persons have been surprised and shocked that I paid my hoodoo informants in the Southern States, something I did not do in Adams County, Illi­nois. In Adams County, where my identity was known, I collected general folklore (weather sayings, planting beliefs, black cat crossing your path, etc.) among an overwhelmingly white population; among the black people of the Southern States, where I was completely unknown, I collected hoodoo (magically how to kill an ene­my, influence the judge at a trial, make someone love you against his will, steal without being caught, etc.), hoodoo in the cities often being considered anunder­world activity. There was a reason for my payments during my hoodoo search in the South. First, I had to use a contact man who had to be paid wages and ex­penses, if he traveled with me. In each city I had to hire a local contact man, usually a taximan whose automobile I also rented. Sometimes I rented a room in his home for interviewing informants. Every informant who came to me knew that two persons were being paid. Sometimes the taximan was separate and I rented the room from a woman. Informants were paid on the basis of the amount and qual­ity of material offered. How much to pay was always a problem. These informants, while I was interviewing someone else, had to wait in the waitingroom one or two or three hours before they could see me. Do you think they came to see me for the purpose of advancing human knowledge? Beside they knew I was writing a hoo­doo book that would be sold. And what about those professional men and women who visited me? They made or tried to make a living from their profession. I always respected their profession. I was there to learn from them, not to teach or criticize them. Would you, the reader, go to your dentist, physician or lawyer and expect to be treated free? Of course I had to pay these professional men and women. Could I pay them and not the smaller informant? Now, on the other hand, when at St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1970, I interviewed the WHITE WOMAN WHO SEES AND HEARS, she, an outstanding teacher with a M.A., wanted to be interviewed in the interests of knowledge. I did not offer this able woman money! Unfortunately I lacked the scientific training to ask the right questions. I did, however, keep everything on a natural basis by asking the history of her health. We had in the last lines of the preceding paragraph an educated white woman who saw strange sights and heard unusual sounds. Her first husband divorced her because of these psychic gifts or psychological problems or physiological dis­orders. Many persons I interviewed could see and hear strange things. Even Edward Bufford, my chief contact man, slept with a light burning to prevent the appearance of spirits. On the other hand some of my informants welcomed the materialization of spirits: I 'municate [communicate] with spirits every nigh� ••• I'm very well e�erienced. I send them any place that I care to •••• I have been so good� I could take a glaBB of water and make anything appear into it. I get off sometime� I gets a doin' an' dissipatin' an' goes out fo' a month\" (from quotations at beginning of Doctor England's interview, p.l386). I am unable to explain the preceding expression goes out except by the term black out. Some­times these seeing persons realize they are dreaming. For interesting examples of this, read about two persons who saw me before we met (p.l095, line 23 to end of interview p.l097). Having met or seen someone before is a well-known psycho­logical problem. I interviewed persons with all sorts of mental difficulties."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -XVII To become acquainted with a mind especially strange, read the quotations pre­ceding my interview of DoctoP Heard, p.l948 . No t one of the foregoing informants is a liar . The question I have been leading up to is: Did some of these black informants tell me a white man lies? A few did, but I tossed out their material. If you work carefully through Hoodoo , you will scarcely find an out-and-out lie. However, you will discover some made-up, legitimately made-up material. Let me explain. If on a visit to your M.D. you complain of a vague sort of pain or a dPaggyfied [sluggish] feeling and he does not know what is wrong with you, he may prescribe something unharmful but possibly useful on the basis of his clinical experience or knowledge of you. Similarly the same situation arose when I inter­viewed a hoodoo doctor. If my question was new or difficult for him, he would answer on the basis of his knowledge. He is making-up a legitimate remedy. Re­member, \"any woPk yo' do,� it 's five OP si:r: ways tuh woPk it\" (p.l870, line 13) . As a matter of fact, some problems in hoodoo have fifty or one hundred solutions! You will find few lies in Hoodoo. Several more illustrations need explanations. The Rt. Rev. Robinson, L.L.[D. ], D.D., (ILL.l8), I did not meet, he being out of the city. This was a misfortune. Please observe his No Witchcraft Used, showing that what I call \"hoodoo\" or \"witchcraft\" has been (with much other evidence) the common term for this prac­tice along the southern Atlantic coast for generations. Illustration 19 tells us more about the Prophet Warkiee Sarheed (see also ILLS. 5 and 8). For the first time I had my palm read by professional palmists -three of them . I will not say that these three palmists would have done so, but some of them , known to be only through informants, will hand out lucky numbers, supply advice in domestic af­fairs, counsel northern visitors on what property to buy or investments to make, and in fact offer any information wanted. I now discuss the three palmists sep­arately: (1). Madam Chakta (ILL.20) definitely Gives answePs to yoUP pPoblems . Would she advise me about some of my problems , I inquired. \"No,\" she replied , but per­haps her mother would see me. Had I asked for an appointment with her mother, her mother would have been temporarily out of the city. These people are exper­ienced and clever. You have probably noticed that she uses the BIBLE-0-GRAPH. If you submit a question, she puts a blank piece of paper in the Bible , closes the book, and after several minutes opens it. Meanwhile there may be a little hocus-pocus to impress you. The paper taken from the Bible contains youranswer: You need special Peadings, or You wi ll succeed with propeP advice , etc. The �ssage had been written previously with invisible ink. I had had this tPick worked on me 30 years before in Little Rock, Ark. (see my opening comment on interview FAITH DOCTOR, p.l315; also p .l323, lines 7-10). That letteP fpom the spiPit tPick had been played on me soon after I had entered the doctoP's consul­tation room before recording could begin , but I kept it in my mind and recorded it indirectly later. (2). Asia Teal (ILL.21), my second palmist was a white woman. Unknowingly, Kr. Cuppy and I visited her home on a no-work day, Wednesday; but she must have peeked through the window and seeing my clericals became curious. Somewhere in BOodOo I say it would be impossible to collect hoodoo while wearing clericals. Forgive that nonsense. As I look back at my mis takes, I actually never learned bow to collect hoodoo. We chatted a few minutes. She , a native of Ohio, had been in business more than 30 years. What did I think about the work on ESP at Duke University. Of cour se you are familiar with Bishop Pike; etc. She t..ediately suspected that I was an investigator of some sort, though she did aot say so. The reading of my palm she conducted with skill and style. I had eacountered an expert, a master of her profession, much, much better than the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"XVIII - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -two black palmists here described. Besides, she charged me $2.50; they, $5 .00 each. At the end I suggested she might like to inform me about her work, her clients for example, for an additional fee, a worth-while one . Uninterested, she declined. The spirit behind her knowledge of me had been exhausted. A week or so later Mr . Cuppy and I attemp ted to meet her again. There were so many automobiles near her house I thought someone in the neighborhood had died . No, said Mr . Cuppy (remember he is a taxi driver), she's always crowded. Neverthe­less I sent him into the house to investigate. He soon returned to report every chair was occupied . Some of the clients had dropped in without appointments. At a later date I telephoned her. Her husband, a part of the business, answered . After telling him I was the clergyman who had had a reading several weeks ago, she came to the telephone . She refused to see me : I said no and I mean no . And I knew she meant no . These people are licensed and can summon the police if annoyed . Her name ASIA TEAL I consider a possible cryptogram signifying Asia TeaZeaves, and that she started her work as a fortuneteller reading tea leaves . (3). My third palmist, black, lived across the bay bridge and several towns south of St . Petersburg. I do no t have her card. She had a triangular altar set against the wall in the corner of her consultation room . It held symbols of all religions; cross, crescent, a few queer looking angels I would have identified as devils, and other objects. There were no candles, but I tmagine they could have been supplied quickly had a believer requested a service. The palm reading did no t take long . She lacked the poise and technique of the other two palmists. Her work was the altar . My questions about it disturbed her. \"Excuse me a moment,\" she said, opening the door to the waitingroom and yelling to a boy we had seen outside when we entered the property. She yelled, \"Did you feed the chickens?\" Anything she yelled would have been sufficient, for I realized the signal hadbeen given and the interview had ended. Two minutes later an automobile drove into the yard. Her final words were, \"I have another appointment. They have just arrived.\" Illustration 29+29A+29B at the end of this volume is a report in 1920 to the former Icy Ho t Bo ttle Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. The president of this company at that time was Mr s. George Altenberg, my future wife -see my letter of 1921 to her, Intra. p.III . I had known her since July 22, 1920, but knew no thing about this report until 44 or 46 years later, when I wrote on original of illustration 29 as follows: This page and fo ZZowing two pages about Icy Hot (thermos [type] bottZe) fi lms [motion pictU!'e fi Zms about Icy Hot] I found onZy after- I had star-ted to pubZish second r-evised edition of FoZkZoroe froom Adams County IZZinois. �at a str-ange coincidence!!!

When I wrote that no te the chances that I would ever complete and publish any part of Hoodoo were slim indeed. These three pages of the report I include among illustrations because they very much conc ern the second edition of FoZkZoroe froom Adams County IZZinois and also the publication of Hoodoo itself . Mo reover, that no tation of mine on March 23, 1966 raises a seeing problem of my own, no t a psychic or supernatural one, because I use the wo rd coincidence, but it do es pose a possible unconscious trick of the mind. (For these seeing and hear-ing problems, see p.XVI, par.2f.) Here is the specific problem. Was I looking at this document for the first time as I thought, or had I casually glanced at it any time during the two preced ing years and had forgotten it? In an attemp t to solve this problem, let me go back five mo nths before March 23, 1966. Towards the end of October 1965, the second edition of FoZkZoroe f�m Adams County IZZinois came from the press in an edition of 1000 copies. The book was"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -XIX dedicated to the memory of my wife, Alma Egan Hyatt. Then I did something some­what original, I created a suvermemorial by immediately mailing 700 copies of the book as a gift to 700 libraries round the world . The only copies ignored by recipients were the 15 scattered across Ru ssia and Siberia . Even Peking (not Peiping but Peking on letterhead) acknowledged its copy. Mo st of these thank­you no tes were form-sheets or form-postcards , but many personal communications also arrived. Some of the latter are quoted in the addenda at the end of Hoodoo volume 2. If I had found 2 9+29A+29B before sending these books round the world , my action would have been a deliberate imitation of a former action by Icy Hot Bot­tle Company and not a coincidence. In other words , at the time of that notation I thought I had just discovered the document, five months after the books had started round the world. My notation should have read I found onZy afteP I had published. Whether imit ation or strange aoinaidenae, the idea of books round the world wa s surely original. You mu st be told , that following my wife 's death I spent some months examining a mass of documents she had left. I could have had a previous glimpse of illustration 29. While these books were on their way round the world , I wa s on the train to New York to consult with the bank , trustees of my wife 's estate. The summer quarterl) payment from the estate being long overdue, I had telephoned my trust officer for an explanation . He explained that the possibility of new payment arrangementshac caused a delay . If I were coming to New York City soon , the bank would like to confer with me about these changes. I answered I had a book in the press and would be at the bank in about two months, sometime in October. When I reached the bank my trust officer referred me to the bank's lawyer , who could better manage the legal details . The latter also had been my wife 'slawyer, had written her will. He was personally known by me . As I walked into hisofficE � hand held a copy of the newly released Fo ZkZoPe fPam Adams County IZZinois, be­cause later that afternoon I would visit old friends, friends of my wife and my­self even in Cincinnati before our marriage. After an exchange of greetings, the lawyer briefly explained that a possibZe heir to the whole of my wife 's estate bad appeared! He was telling me this two years after my wife 's death, after all tazes had been paid , after thousands of dollars in bequests had been honored ! He was talking about a possibZe heir! (All through this momentous conference, 51 �ories up in the air , we talked calmly!) Then he handed me a copy of the will of George Altenberg, my wife's first husband. He bequeathed everything to his wi£e Alma. At a later date came the codicil , that after his wife 's death his estate would revert to his mo ther and sister or to either if the other had died. Ceorge Altenberg I never knew, he being dead before I reached Cincinnati. I had read that will and all documents of the estate two years before, they � among papers left by my wife, and I had not been disturbed by them. Two ..eks after the bank meeting, my wife's nephew Thomas Egan Feuss hired a firm of la.yers to defend the large bequest he had already received from her estate. One of �bese lawyers later called this affair the greatest case ever to involve the Probate Court, no lawyer he had talked to ever having heard anything like it . Bareover he stated that some competent person should publish all the documents ... aunotate them; it would become a legal classic . He also added that I had �s for a suit against the bank . And all this occurred while I was trying t. pat together the first two volumes of Hoodoo!!! Here is how my present discussion further conc erns Hoodoo. The bank did not & .... payments to me until the estate was settled almost three years later . Had �bank learned one year sooner about the possibZe heir , the second edition of lblkloPe [Pam Adams County IZZinois would never have been published. Without"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"XX -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -its publication no attempt would ever have been made to complete Hoodoo. Stmilarly revelant here, I must include one of my wife's automatic notes writ­ten in 1922 just after she had sold the Icy Hot Bottle Company. Though undated , the subject matter of this note is unmistakable; not legal evidence of course, but meaningful in a search for truth. (For these automatic notes, see CONTENTS of present volume, next to last page.) My future wife's sister-in-law -THE CLAIMANT WHO WOULD REAPPEAR 45 YEARS LATER -had threatened to bring suit against her. Presumably she did this as one of the two residuary legatees of her broth­er's estate, because she had not been legally notified of the intended sale so that she could protec t her interests. There is no court record of such notifi­cation. On the basis of the will and lack of legal notification , the sister-in­law had the law on her side. Did she? The legal notification was never issued because my future wife clatmed always to have been the owner of her husband's stock and the Judge of the Probate Court so allowed. The year before George Alt enberg's death, personal documents show she received the income on two large blocks of stock about half of the total. All this of course is not so stmple as it sounds. The Internal Revenue Service in Washington , D.C., made the widow pay taxes on the estate, saying it did not recognize the decrees of a Probate Court. That IRS letter is a revealing docu­ment about the lack of woman's rights! However, one man in Cincinnati did accept the decree of the Probate Court. Icy Hot was bought by the city's smoothest financial ope�toP, who planned to resell it as soon as possible to the Thermos Bottle Company. I neither believed in 1965, nor do I believe now, that this ope�toP or Thermos would have purchased a pig in a poke. Yes, my feelings were just that, as I sat opposite the bank's lawyer, mywife's own lawyer. Yes again, I was in a state of shock; not about the money from her estate, I could continue to keep on living. Opening the book in my hand to the correct page, I pushed it across the desk to htm. HePe is a pi�tuPe of the woman we aPe talking about. What you and the bank aPe thinking, if not saying, is that this woman, known by me 43 yeaPs and maPPied to 40 yeaPs, ws a fPaud! These are not the exact words of course, but the substance of what I said. In that hour, that book was what my hoodoo informants would have called a hand or a mojoh or a good-lu�k pie�e, my needed spiritual power. That photograph handed to the lawyer happened to be a part of a strange, strange statement called \"Pictures for Alma,\" the addenda to Fo lkloPe fPom Adams County Illinois, second edition . It is a haphazard fragment from the material and memories I tmmediately began to collect about her after returning home from the burial in Cincinnati. This and the mass of documents she left had kept me busy from October to spring as I lived there alone in the Gladstone home (ILLS. 9-17 ). The book itself, ready to run off the press, I held up several weeks while I threw together some photographs and paragraphs from the preceding col­lection. This mixture, too large, I had to reduce to the present size by elim­inating half the paragraphs, one here and another there. Its purpose? My wife would have said I had foreknowledge of the trouble about to descend upon me. Can a man have a purpose who uses as a colophon for the book, his wife's epitaph! I did something just as unusual at her funeral in St. Lukes Episcopal Church, Glad­stone, New Jersey . The funeral service had just ended. At my side stood my niece; up in the chancel was my great friend, the Rev. J. Langtry Willams (ILL.28) assisting the Rector. No one in church knew about what would happen next. Eight men, dressed alike, undertaker assistants, came up the aisle. Each grasped a handle of the coffin . Instead of marching forward, they suddenly raised the cof­fin upon their shoulders, and then slowly lockstepped down the aisle.

These 3 frames still hang on my bedroom walls.

These original letters, permis_sion to work among black people and to identify me in case of a raid as the result of a complaint , will be filed with the manuscript, the transcriptions from the original cylinders. Before I forget, my only possible explanation for \"Pictures for Alma\" wa s and still is, they in a much abridged form tried to complement or answer my wife's automatic notes. The latter were messages written or scribbled with various de­grees of automaticaZity under great stress, fatigue, sorrow, to communicate usu­ally with a spirit. A good example of one type of automatic note is the one written by my future wife in 1919 on a letter of thanks she had just received from Drecoll, her couturier in Paris, he located in a building opposite the Opera . The thanks were for the French mourning costume she had recently pur­chased, her husband having just died in Paris. (Mrs. Ivy Eisenman in her letter to me of March 21 , 1964 - at end of \"Pictures for Alma\" -describes the costume.) On my finding Alma's note in 1963 or 1964, I immediately wrote an answer. You will find her note and mine under it in volume 1, opposite unnumbered p.l of the text . Should I reveal to you before the appearance of volume 4, that her dead husband actually wrote a note answering her preceding plea? And that, dear read­er , is the real automatic note! Automatic notes, fake ones at least , are common in hoodoo (see Hoodoo, v.3, Intra . XVII, under Madam Chakta). While doing field work it never occurred to me to search for real automatic notes surely used by some doctors. I mean a real note written by the doctor, completely forgotten, and then rediscovered by him as a message from the spirit. Our final illustration, No .31, pictures the result of my attempts for more than 50 years to produce a bookplate that would identify me . My first bookplate was one of those two-pronged devices, actually a punch, into which you inserted the front flyleaf, pressed the two prongs together , and embossed EX LIBRIS over HARRY M. HYATT . Then followed a succession of designs , some in color . The lat­ter idea probably appeared in the 1930's, after I became acquainted with Gordon Craig 's book Nothing. His colored designs were too small to express anything suitable for me . About two years ago , after seeing an excellently designed Zodiac five or six inches in diameter , an inspiration flashed through my mind; put the titles of my two books within and around the circle. Should I enclose everything within solid black circular lines? No , leave everything open, give the spirit a chance to breathe , roam about at will. All this I did in less than an hour. After my design came off the press, I discovered a serious flaw; the printer in twisting the word HOODOO separated it into HOO-DOO! Instead of a mistake ruining 1000 bookplates for my much reduced library, I rationalized the accident into a virtue. The flaw had converted the design into a perfect piece of magic. That is why the hunchback, the pegleg and the blind man, imp erfec­tions , are lucky in folklore. And finally, notice that this bookplate, the symbol of fifty years of effort, is the colophon for volume 3. Those words Harry Middleton Hyatt GeneaZogiaaZ Papers 19'13 on the title page of this volume contain another archive of mine. This vast collection of original material is a documented study of, not hearsay or guesswork about, my families, all of whom lived on the colonial frontier . I began this search as a high-school boy, writing letters, visiting people, and later examining court and other rec­ords. These thousands of pages of material, much of it in my own writing , as well as letters, account books , etc. , I have been Xeroxing into ten copies to be de­posited next year in well-known archives, such as Virginia State Archives, Rich­mond, Va. , Kentucky Historical Society, Frankfort, Ky . , and others ."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -XXIII A word about the name AZma Egan Hyatt Foundation. It was once a legal corpor­ation paying for magazines, books, and my field work. There are no longer any funds to be granted . That period between May 1972 (the trip to California) and July 1973 (visits to Indiana and Arkansas) was the final great experience of my life. What I have written about this adventure among folklore scholars and students is very inade­quate. After rereading my account about them , a few more names must bementioned: (1). Herbert Halpert, Memorial University, in St. Johns, Newfoundland , Canada. Following that amazing conference with the bank's lawyer in New York City previ­ously described , I found on reaching home the first of those formal notes of thanks for Folklo�e f�om Adams County Illinois. Here at least wa s something that could not be undone by a bank or court of law 45 years later! Two weeks after­ward came Dr. Halpert 's letter of November 19, 1964 (see Hoodoo, v.l, Intra. p.XI) . I did not even know that the first edition of FAC I was being used in a university. Several newspapers had printed popular articles , and once selections from the book had been read on radio by Arthur Godfrey . I told Dr. Halpert at the Texas meeting his letter had given me the encouragement sorely needed to re­start Hoodoo. (2) . Alan Dundes, University of California at Berkeley, introduced himself. To my remark about seeing his book upstairs in the publishers display, he asked whether I had seen my name in it. I had not. He took me back upstairs and pointed out my name several times, promising to mail me a copy on returning to California. The book soon arrived and here is its unusual title: Mo the� Wit f�om the Laughing Ba��el: Readings in the Interp�etation of Af�o-Ame�ican Fo lklo�e. Laughing Barrel? A black slave who could not control his mirth, stuck his head down into a barrel to prevent his ma ster from hearing the excessive laughter. (3) . Bruce Jackson , Director of Center for Studies in American Culture, State University of New York at Buffalo. Later he wrote me a letter I consider, as I wrote to him, \"a sensitive and understanding appraisal of Hoodoo. \" (4) . Barbara K. and Warren Walker , wife and husband , I rememb er quite well, having watched them prepare for the presentation of a Turkish mo tion picture film SUSUZ YAZ , by Ulvi Dogan, first prize winner, Berlin Film Festival , 1964. This vas a story or study of Turkish rural life. The Walkers once had lived in Tur­key, he winning a Fulbright Scholarship. She had written a number of books , some in cooperation with her husband , a list of which I have temporarily misplaced . Both are at Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas. (5-10) . Daniel J. Crowley, University of California , Davis, an expert on the Jamaica narrative; Frank de Caro, Louisiana State University; David Hufford, Memorial University of Newfoundland ; Alan Jabbour , Library of Congress; Donald A. Bird, Central Michigan University; and Dr . Mark? Mealing? , Selkirk College, Castlegan, B.C., Canada . (11). Roderich Moore , a very young man, was the last folklorist I met in Austin, Texas. As I sat alone at the high table watching the crowd leave the Regency Room, he approached asking could he speak with me for a few minutes. I would be delighted . He taught at Mount Empire Community College, Big Stone Gap , Va . , population 7070 in 1960, and surely several thousand larger on the 1970 census. This town is in the extreme southwest triangular corner of Virginia. By wife and I in 1928 had been near it when at Abington, Va ., Kingsport, Tenn. (about 20 miles away as a crow flies) , and Cumberland Gap . Mr . Moore had already started to search for my type of folklore, interviewing root people, healers, and witchcraft persons. His having attempted Richmond , where I had collected years before, interested me . He wanted to know whether I had ever heard a story about tao snakes. Only once, as I remember, when someone attributed this feat to the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"XXIV -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -powers of DoatoP Buzzard. Just as the judge was about to sentence the defendant, two snakes, standing upright on their tails, corkscrewed or spiraled into the courtroom. Everyone in the courtroom, including the judge, rushed outs ide the courthouse. This inability of the judge to beg in or complete the sentence auto­matically freed the prisoner. So that readers meeting Hoodoo for the first time in volume three will have a proper perspective of all preceding mater ial, I will summarize it briefly . Vol­ume one contains: A StPange WoPtd (a few typical witchcraft stories and beliefs to establish the atmosphere within), GhostloPe , Spirits with speaial FoPms , SpiP­its and Anirmls, Blaak Cat Luaky Bone, Se ll Se lf to Devil, spirits GuaPd Buried TPeasuPe , Hag OP Witah in Hag FoPm, \"DoatoPs \" Themselves (Diagnosis of Spe lls and \"Doatol'S \" fPom BiPth to Death), Time and Hoodoo spell, PI'inaip les of Healing , CuPes and FToteation, \"H ands\" OP Magia He lpePs, Business and CustomePs FToduaed by \"DoatoP\", Shrines and Altare and Candles and Saints in New OPleans APea, and MoPe \"DoatoPs\" Desaribed by Laymen. Volume two contains Intewiews: My ConVePsa­tions with \"Doa tol'S \"· Volume three, as you can see, continues the Intewie'I.IX3 of volume two. Then follows a lengthy division on The Physiaal RUman Body Itself divided into ten sections, the first section Sexual Imp otenae (pp.2341-2509). Here for the first time in American folklore, sex rites and beliefs were normally collected , sex itself being treated as a legitimate part of folk life. This material, unusual for its time , was recorded during the years 1 9 3 6-1942. Despite my own liberal views, sex did delay the publication of Hoodoo. I had no desire willfully to offend, I had never tauntingly shouted , Devil! Devil! Even so, someone will say, But only uneduaated blaaks believe that soPt of thing! Only they? Listen to the Family Weekly, published in New York, N.Y., distributed to Sunday newspapers throughout the United States, and to me locally (August 8, 1 97� by The Quincy HePald Whig (Quincy, Illinois). The first inside page, contains a �ouble column called Ask Them YoUl'Self, in which readers ask a famous pePson a question. A photograph of each famous pePson is opposite the question asked and answered. R.N., of Bloomington, Indiana, asks a question of Gail Kuhn, author of Sexual Powers Through Witchcra ft: \"Can men over 40 really be sexually reg enerated , as you claim?\" Gail Kuhn, a white woman according to her photograph, answers: \"I believe men from 18 to 75 can be sexually regenerated by witchcraft.

This fifth or central point is widely used in hoodoo as a magic place.] (That snake about your house will give you power to do these things?) Yes sir . If yuh have a snake in yore business yuh kin do any'hin' yuh wanta. [Let me divide this comment into 3 parts: (1) THE PRECEDING ACCOUNT IS A RARE EXAMPLE, MY ONLY ONE, OF HOW SOME DOCTORS USING SNAKES OBTAIN A SNAKE COMPANION OR HELPER . A SNAKE IS NEITHER SOUGHT NOR BOUGHT, IT COMES TO THE DOCTOR'S HOME. (You wi11 remember that informant's preced ing healing-frog was hopping your way.) Our snake is a version of the ancient mysterious visitor of folklore, orig inally the return of an ancestral spirit. My informant previously offered to tell me where I could buy luck y salts, and how I could obtain roots: If you �nta go in business (as a root-worker). Is she now suggesting that if a snake comes to my house, I keep him and train him? That he could be worth a hundred dollars to my business? The situat ion here can be understood better by consult ing margin title SNAKE, p.66. (2) The snake crawling upon the patient as a sign of victory in court is a rite of divination, a subject I have gathered largely under DIAGNOSIS, pp.16 5-217 - see margin title SNAKE, p.209 . (3) An obsolete meaning of the pre­ced ing word wise is magia, a word and meaning popularly coming to us from the Biblical wise men [[magic men] ] from the east (Matt. 2:1, King James Version). Instead of wise men, The New English Bible rightly has astrologers. We have wise woman (a healer), I interviewed in HOODOO, p.l294, and several examples of wise man and wise person in the text. These terms appeared to be dying out back in the 1930's. Were they killed by the repugnant snear, wise guy? More expressive than wise was the black man's term (if he coined it) two-head or dOuble-head, a person so wise or learned in the arts of magic, hoodoo and the occult, that he needed two heads to hold his knowledge. I deliberately used the word was instead of is, because two-head and dOuble-head have become suspected titles; Doator Caf­frey being almost the only one of my informants to admit \"I 'm the two-headed man\" -see title quotation, p.1459.] (HOW DO THEY CATCH A PERSON'S SPIRIT?)

Yessuh. Well, ah have hear some talk concernin' of it, but not payin' much 'tenshun tub it. [I pay great 'tenshun tuh WHIRLWIND, pp.46-53. ] Take two ru sty files if somebody done somepin tub yo '.

(So that the water will just run over that cross in those two files, where the fLles are crossed.) Dat bring de refuge tub yuh tub ovahcome jes' whatevah yo ' wanta ovahcome. (That brings a refuge to you to overcome your trouble as that water overflows �t cross in the file.) [SHE USES A GOSPEL HY.MW FIGURE OF SPEECH, REFUGE IN THE CROSS.] Dat's right . Takes a piece outa his undahweah dere. (Down below the privates.) iell, dey jes' go an' fix it up an' tie it up an' bind it up, an' prob'ly �ve it up in some tree or somepin, where it would be airtighted .

An' she'll take dat stick an' go an' hide it undah somewhere, even if she wanta go an' put it undah a log dat weights a thousan' pounds.

[Rubbing upwards (see margin title UPWARDS, p.405) is common only in impotence rites, most rubbing rites being downwards to rub ailments out of the body through the feet and sometimes the big toe. In the present instance, the pPivate is sym­bolically rubbed upwards for an erection. The rite now following also has an up­wa.Pds action.] Well, if dat didn't do it [the preced ing rite] , git 'im a clean - a dishrag an' wash it clean. Well, he should steal a dishrag, but he mustn't git one outa his house. Go tuh some neighbor house where he jes' goes through lak he do home an' steal de dishrag, dat dey uses tuh wash dishes, an' gives it a wash befo' he use it.

Take it [bat h water] out an' throw it toward de sunrise co'se, an' be sure tuh throw it [dish rag] in a tree an' let it hang jes' as high as yo' kin throw it. As soon as he git it up on dere, jes' soon his aoUPage will be dere. [The preceding rite of throwing the used dishrag high up into a tree is merely another upwards action to produce the similar erection mentioned in the foregoing turpentine cure.] Dey tells me people gives a man dog livah.

[To fully understand the preced ing wise-head woman and her two snakes, read the remarkable story of the hoodoo woman in Richmond, Va ., who similarly sent out two snakes to do her work (219, p .66) . We should also note the kind of snakes our wise-head woman uses: highland mocasain or copperhead, one of the few poison­ous snakes in the U .S.A., and the king snake, a large non-poisonous snake, called the king of aZZ snakes in hoodoo because it kills other snakes. And so poison and power are joined with fear and awe of snakes and witchcraft - quite a combi­nation! We must not forget the single snake sent through the air to dominate a crowded courtroom (248 , p .70) .] [An example of one of those rare not-letting-it-touch-the-skin rites follows:] An individual said [another way for informant to say AH HEARD] , dat if mah coat wa s stole off mah body an' ah wanted tuh git dat coat back- hung on de wall an' someone taken it, ah wear it daily - whensoevah ah wanta git dat coat back dat stole by unknown parties, dere wusn't but one thing fo ' me tuh do about dis coat.

At times an informant's thought is no t only involved, it is also fall of holes. That is why I asked that question about the green bottle. The .-rPOseless burial o£ that bottle in the grave was senseless. My question about � reaa rded me with a rare cure for fever . LET ME RECREATE THE RITE: The person �oraing the rite has been spelled with a fever by some enemy using graveyard �; possibly dirt from the grave of a person dying from a fever . Remember , in IDlklore feVeP is a disease, not a symptom. To cure himself the fevered person c.rries 13 pennies and an empty green bottle with stopper to a grave. Whether � is the grave of a person dying with a fever, I do not know. He summons the ...a person's spirit by calling the name of the dead 9 times. Then the sick man )-eels at the grave and begins to scoop up 13 handfuls of dirt, laying down into � bole made a penny after ea ch handful put in a paper sack. We now reach the CZW£Jal place in the rite. He holds the neck of the bottle in his left hand, so � his thumb covers the mouth, and his right hand can grasp the stopper . He I &Ina an incantation: In de Name of de FatheP. The thumb pressed against the � of the bottle is quickly raised, as he blows once into the bottle, and then �ckly repressed against the bottle mouth. This action he repeats for de Son ... for an' Holy Ghost. Three times he blows into the bottle and three times the a.ct1e is closed, the last time tightly. The bottle and 13 pennies on it are � in the center of the grave; this spot with the four corners of the grave ,.._ina a magic quincunx (see margin title p.710 and elsewhere) . Some general ...aer may ask, Is it not dangePous to blow one 's own spiPit into a bottle (see � title p.24) and to buPy it in a gPave? No , because our hoodooed man does � blav his own, he blows the spiPit of the feVeP into the bottle. Having paid ·� arave spirit 13 pennies for the 13 handfuls of gPave diPt, our fever victim ... �es it home in a paper sa ck.

This woman, informant 15451 was among those professional workers who greeted my RETURN TO MEMPHIS (see v.l1 INTR0.1 p.XXXVIII). In title-quotation two she gives an excellent example of the numerous rites of spitting; there alone being about 98 of them in the first edi­tion of my FACI. That third title-quotation bears the longest name of many pow­ders in HOODOO. Teasin'-brown. of course, refers to the complexion of certain brown-skin Negro women - to say black women here would be a contradiction in terms . As for terms, our informant has a few new ones; inside luck and outside luck among others. There are also some unusual rites: the powder box; an elabo­rate quincunx, and a simple quincunx with a bed; and one of those scarce keyhole rites . Despite frequent over-the-shoulder rites, title-quotation four is rare. Any over-the-shoulder rite fools the stupid spirit residing within the object about to be cast away forever , but the present rite triply deceives the spirit.

The insole having touched the man is a part of his spirit, and because a part of his spirit equals his whole spirit (see p.21), the whole of the man's cap tured spirit (see p.24) resided in the portable powder kit . His spirit, constantly looking into the mirror of the closed lid, is con­fused and unable to escape.

An' dey have somepin else in dere looked lak peppah, an' in dere it had nine needles an' nine pins stickin' in a little red-flannel piece. An' so dey undid dis here glove in dis pillah an' dey carried it back to dis [hoodoo] woman, see. She tole dem dat whut made her suf­fah so severe wit 'er head, see. An' tole her dat dese people in de [same] house wanted dem [headache woman and her husband] tuh move out, see, becuz evah mawnin' she would fin' dis fresh salt an' dis cayenne feppah sprinkled all aroun' in each room an1 in de do'.

An' aftah dey did [cause aonfusion], well yo' see dey couldn't git along an' she [headache woman] moved out. See, she moved outa de house. An' dis woman whut wuz in de house dat wuz tryin' tuh make 'er move, she wanted 'er husban1, see. She wanted tuh make confusion between 'er [headache woman] an' 'er husban'.

An' she [said she] wuz goin' tuh do somepin to hUPt 'er tuh make her move or tuh break dem up, see.

Yet, if this red murkle root turns white with boiling, as we just saw in the jailhouse procedure, its symbolism would suggest good rather than evil.

To walk backwards is a com­mon counteractant in general folklore against bad luck. Perhaps the greatest number of these walking-backwards counteractants will be found under a black cat crossing your path. FAC I gives 19 walking-backwards rites for meeting this cri­sis, two of them concerned with backing-up automobiles (see 2nd ed ., 2117-2136, pp. 84-85) . In HOODOO there are several examples of walking backwards towards a stream before throwing an obj ect over your shoulder into running water . This latter , too, is a protective measure. Our informant, after the victim has walked over the buried article, walks over it backwards to give it increased and immedi­ate power. The present belief will not be found elsewhere in HOODOO. Perhaps the mo st interesting example of walking-backward comes to us from DoctoP Heard, who walked backward into the graveyard - see title quotation, p.l949, line 16f . In this interview we also meet the fairly rare person who eats clay, an earth eater . Informant 1573 - one of the many different types of dbctoPs in New Orleans -was recorded on cylinders E57-E62 = 2833-2895.] Well, all right, about de snail.

Meanwhile, except for my greeting as she entered the door, I sat there like a bump on a log , forgetting to turn on my recording machine. �­.ediately after laying out the first row of cards, she started to interpret thea. As I looked back upon this experience later I wondered whether her silence was a stage prop or a magic act, the latter conferring success upon her venture or in­creasing her interpretative power . She had been brought up by and among older people; once again a craft being handed down through a family. What she says about more hoodoo than formerly among the old-timePs is true. She also could have added the craft changed slower in country districts than in cities. Com­.ercialism changed and is still changing the old witchcraft and conjuration. I .ust pause here to add something that happened yesterday.] [This morning (November 6, 1972) on the 7 o'clock CBS televised news, I saw and listened to a brief report showing some black people in Beaufort (Bii 'fert) County, S.Car. , reviving their African tribal dance. More interesting to me was the sheriff, 26 years in office, who related some of his experiences with hoodoo. Mentioned were one of the DoctoP Buzzards (see pp.891-905) and the after-m y-time DbctoPs Bug and Eagle. The surprising thing said by the sheriff went like this: years ago few white people believed in this soPt of thing� but now moPe than 60S of them aPe believePs! MoPe whites than blacks believe in hoodoo! The Beaufort newspaper reporter then introduced a young white man with a spell. Finally a psychiatrist in Charleston was asked , \"Is there anything true in hoodoo?\" The doctor gave the only possible reply under the circumstances, \"If you believe it, it is true for you.\" Amazing was the statement made by the national anchor man, vho opened the interview by informing us that witchcraft had died out everywhere in the United States except the Southern States. Where has he been all these years!

The preceding title-page quotation with other material was previously removed from the present interview to become margin title THE PRIVATE SHRINE -MASTER AND UNCLE -JESUS AND SPIRITUALISM (No.2757, pp. 773-775). I had to add this margin title to balance the preced ing margin title PUBLIC SHRINE AND THE CUSTODIAN (No .2753-2756, pp .770-773).] [Here is my opening comment for the private-shrine margin title: The following statements come fPom the intePview with the giPl mentioned in the INTRODUCTION [[see late P]] because of heP youthful age foP this kind of woPk.

Mounting tension and fatique on account of age demanded the immediate release of HOODOO . Speaking of tension, all three of us - Edward, Mack and I -were not too well during our vork in Algiers. That receipt from the New Orleans Private Patrol Service, Inc. (see ILLUSTRATIONS) shows the atmosphere under which we lived . The white over­lords of the underworld suspected a white man who was asking strange questions aaong the black people. They had sent in their stool pigeons, male and female. (Somewhere in HOODOO I commend Edward for getting rid of or warning me against a stool pigeon.) The type of work I was doing, they knew; also that I had police permission, that we took the ferry back to the city long before dark. I respect­ed their opinion of me . No man in his right mind would spend time and·money aDd inconvenience on such an asinine pretense as mine. I was an undercover man!] [This is the reason I was surprised when Edward brought into the interviewing room a small girl, a child . He introduced her . She knew this work, had quite a reputation, he told me . I asked her her age. Seventeen she answered. Even so I could not see myself staying in the room with her alone. Through my closed door opening into Eagle Eye Hall (INTRO. p.XL, line 8) were people waiting to see .e. One of them could be her confederate ready to rush in at a planned scream . (For similar problems in field work, see margin title NEW ORLEANS, 1!_., MY FIRST VISIT in INTRO. p.XXXI.) Since I thought she knew little about hoodoo work - a young fortuneteller at best - and would remain only a few minutes, I suggested that Edward stay in the room. If there were any secrets she did not care to"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"2222 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -reveal in his presence, he would leave .] [Then came the surprise. She had an excellent mind, thinking rapidly and speaking fluently . Someone had trained her well, possibly a member of her own family. She knew, thought and talked hoo doo, had made a religion of it . Candles cast holiness over everything. Her personal spirit, guide or control, Uncle, did all work for her or others for whom she worked; but she \"christianized\" every­thing by asking Jesus to \"back up\" Uncle. Once again in hoodoo Jesus is de \"troick givero\" and de \"trick takero\" (Madam Collins, p. 994, 5 lines from bottom of page); once again the Lo� Jesus Chroist is the biggest hoodoo too in de worold (p .l624, first title quotation) . Though I list her as from New Orleans (p .773) , which is true, she belonged to Algiers, a part of New Orleans \"across de River\" or on the \"west bank\". Her material was collected on cylinders El32-E138 = 2965-2971. ] Yo ' wanta know 'bout hoodoos - lak if yo ' wanta know 'bout graveyard dust, yo ' go an ' yo ' vanta do sompin ag' inst a person or make a person drag or have 'em tuh do anything dat chew wan' 'em tuh do .

Ah doa' keer [care] what chew do off frum heah. Well, in dis town heah, whosomevah ca.e vbD ain' t got de grandest [hand] bill, don' want 'em.

From this evidence we occasionally learn, that even after a per­son has performed all ceremonies for the bone, the bone will remain useless un­less a doatoro \"dresses\" it. Such a droessing, however, was never normal procedure. Our present informant, No.1572, happens to be the only expert who ever gave me a completely new theory of the blaak aat Zuaky bone; one logically explaining why professional services are required. As a part of his explanation he also tells us this �essing lasts only 7 years. For a time limit on hands, and the blaak aat luaky bone is a hand, see p.577. Informant has several unusual rites, especially title quotation 4. This is merely one of primitive man's many taboos against women, one that has continued down to modern times. A woman must never crawl or clfmb over a man in bed (or step over him lying on the floor or ground), because it gives her the superoioro position, the magic position that makes her more powerful than the man. One of the most interesting statements about woman's position I caae across years ago while living in England . I frequently bought fairly early printed books for a few shillings. One of them, Spanish author if I remember. with tezt in Latin of course, stated: It is a sin, what kind I no longer remember. (surely not mortal!), for a woman to assume the superoioroposition in coitus! (The author writing in Latin naturally uses the words superoioro and inferoioro. ) Bow long did that one remain in moral theology and penitentials? I know nothing like this in general folklore! The folk have too much common sense. But something about the superoioro position has survived in general folklore : A proegnant �man by �Zing overo the husband aan troansfero hero futuroe laboro pains to him (FACI1 2nd ed., 2953, p.l33) . A milder form was previously collected: If a proegnant � �ls overo hero husband� he is going to suffero as many pains as she will have (FACI, 1st ed., 2508 , p.l22). Informant's material was recorded on cylinders E53 :1-E57:3 = 2886-2890.] Wal [well]1 as ah wuz fir' [ first] sayin', if de woman wanted tuh hold 'er man, she kin take his socks.

We had been there a number of times, not including the boat trains �o and from Dover. On this present occas ion our destination was countryside alone. Consequently we had luncheon not in Canterbury, Tunbridge Wells, or other �toric towns, but in a small village inn. Since the dining room was small, fiDally empty, and time did not press us, we made ourselves known to the propr�­etor and his wife. Both were natives of South Africa. Almost immediately they �ed the conversation to mealies - the South African word for American POaBting ears or sweet corn - because they frequently ate them from the can, tin I should .. y here. Wa s there, they asked, any dislike of the odor of mealies in The States? Neither of us had ever heard of any. After we had returned to our aato­.abile, my wife relayed an additional piece of information from the woman. Qu�te a number of English people, some traveling in South Africa and other �n The States, thought mealies or sweet corn smelled like a man's semen. I bave heard that belief several times since.

Every­where he carefully points out how a rite produces its own power. Power comes from correct procedure, not from God. His use of the T�ee Ho ly Names is prac­tical, saientifia, not religious. Complicated thought confronts us at times. He reasons closely, if you want to call this sort of thing reasoning. Could I describe him as meticulous? Repetition also abounds, either naturally or because like a good teacher he makes certain I understand. Perhaps he tries to impress. I was impressed, still am. Yet a year or two later, after I had heard other capable men and women, some of my first impressions had worn off. At least about this time I marked the original transcription of his words \"doubtful,\" meaning \"restudy.\" Finally I added a \"ng.\" Perhaps I was tired, careless - who knows?

De firs' thing yo ' do aftah yo ' know de house is aPossed up , an' yo' become suspicious dat de house is aPossed up , why den yo ' take yo ' a common thing.

SEXUAL IMPOTENCE [Impotence in hoodoo has no medical or psychological cause. Neither bodily weakness nor mental problem makes you sexually inadequate. You are impotent because some man or woman has you tied or tied up. Originally this meant someone bad put a spell on you by tying something of yours, or by tying anything while ... ing or wishing it you. Consequently, like all ailments and diseases of the body, impotence comes from hoodoo, conjuration, witchcraft, or rootwork. All following rites with few exceptions are to keep a man away from another woman, or a woman away from another man. They could be called ahastity-belt rites. This section SEXUAL IMPOTENCE is divided into subsections CAUSES and CURES.] (1). CAUSES OF SEXUAL IMPOTENCE (a)� MISCELLANEOUS [This subsubsection is called MISCELLANEOUS because it contains everything that would not fit into the four remaining homogeneous subsubsections, namely: DISHRAG, DOG, KNOTS, and SNAIL. Margin titles, here as elsewhere, will try to iadicate the great variety of ideas involved, including: magic actions, objects, places, substances, and thoughts or intentions.] 3110.

A COMMON BELIEF: \"THE MORE WOMEN ••• THE BIGGER IT MAKES HIM\" Then the children will have it, in­herit that, you see, by having bad blood. Well, that is worse than the other. It happen that a poor [boy] get gonorrhea or anything that way, he has a certain amount of energy in him, he can't get it out of him unless he has connection with a woman. But if he ever once has the claps, the running Pange, or gonorrhea, every time he urinates he urinates some ambition, you see. That 's why a man can be 45 years old and younger than a boy 25, you see, by using himself [properly] in his young days before he developes. [New Orleans, La. , (816) , 1158:5.] 3111.

I am certain my informant equates purgement with ejaculation or emission, not with something impure. A man's pur­gement is semen, a collection of so-called seeds. A real seed , of course, is complete in itself, needing only a soil or place in which to grow, and nurishment. These latter says folklore are what the woman's purgement supplies, a suitable liquid for the growth and development of man's so-called seed . It never occurred to folklore and earlier medicine that a man's so-called seed was incomplete; that it became a true seed only by uniting with a woman's ovum or egg. Before uniting, the single successful semen and ovum had been single separate cells; but after union they became one new cell, which immedia tely split into two cells and many others. What the woman purges according to folklore is pazot of 'eP \"nature\"� de same as ma.h \"nature\".

Her urine will serve the same purpose, drawing power, by writing his name on a piece of parchment and dropping it into the bottled urine. This time she does not pour the urine through a flour sifter with a handle; she lays a round hand sift er - large wooden hoop with wire screening on one side - on the chamberpot and squats over it to relieve herself. Her urine passing through the sifter protects it against countermagic. For good measure his perspiration in a piece of his old clothing is added.

(I see, you get the spirit of his voice in this bottle.) [An old comment of mine in pencil about this rite reads Use with caPe. This rite is quite all right , except I failed to understand the word double when first checking transcription with the cylinder . Thinking that the waist measure was increased 9 times , I wondered how such a long string could be squeezed into one of those tiny bottles of perfume then sold for 10¢ at the Five-and-Ten -Cents Store. At the time of recording I probably knew the meaning of double because I do no t ask a question about it , but I must no t rule out knowledge coming from later experience. Here is what happens . The man wraps a piece of ordinary pack­age-wrapping string about his waist, ties a knot, and cuts off the two unneeded ends. He now has a loop or circle of string , say about 30 inches in circumfer­ence, which he pushes down over his thighs and off his body. This string he stretches out into a straight line of double string 15 inches long and at a right angle to his body ; the knot being at one end , this end away from him. This knot he now folds toward him until it coincides with the other end of the string . This once-folded string is now 4 parallel strings each 7 1/2 inches long . Turn­ing this shortened string 180° 1 so that the knot is again away from him, he a second time folds the knot to him, reducing the multiple strings to a 33/4 inches length . Remember, he is folding strings soaked with his urine. The strings are folded to him 9 times, at least theoretically. All this is not statedexplicitly in the rite itself; it is implicit in this type of folding rite . No boss having his spirit triply captured -tied into a knot about applican'ts body , folded up towards applicant and in applicant's urine , and finally stopped up in a bottle -"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"2618 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -no boss could possibly resist such multiple magic .] [Charleston, S.

This letter will put into writing, I hope , some of the things that we talked about , particularly plans for some kind of coop­erative effort in the future . As you know, I have admired your work very much for many years and have looked upon it as the cornerstone of all of my own researches in the field of popular belief, superstition , and custom. I look for­ward eagerly to working up the great volumes on conj ury and folk me dicine , which represent such a tremendous investment of energy and time on your part over many years . With regard to your trip to Los Angeles, I suggest perhaps the best time might be the weekend of May 5-6, when the Folklore and Mythology section of the Southern California Academy of Sciences will be meeting here on the UCLA campus . I am trying to persuade Duncan Emrich to come, and perhaps pre­vail upon him to give a pa:e_er before the group on oome aspects of the folklore of the We st, even �is hobby of the folklore of miners. You could either arrive on the 5th and stay through to Sunday or Monday, or you could come earlier in the week and finish off on Saturday, whichever seems better to you. It would be a tremendous inspiration for our young graduate students , as well as for the staff of the Folklore and Mythology Group to hear you reminisce about your many years of experience as a col­lector of folklore, witchcraft , folk me dicine , and all the rest. This might best be done informally before a relatively select group at my home on Friday, May 5, but I could easily arrange it to fall on another night .
