Yet there is a tendency to limit what is referred to as traditionalwitchcraft to just a few groups. As a result of this exclusivity the great diversity of thecraft, its richness, risks becoming lost. Yet, when you call upon the spirits and theyanswer, who can deny you this connection?Traditional Witchcraft is a set of practices born from need, land and blood. It is theart of working one's fate and the art of working hedge, hill and mound for one's benefitor that of a group or conclave of people and their needs. The witch in the traditionalsense is someone who is aware of their pedigree, the particular blood that sets themapart. Because of its diversity Traditional Witchcraft remains misunderstood.Some even see it as a vacant term that can be filled with whatever meaning onechooses. That is not my intention. Even if Traditional Witchcraft varies – sometimesdramatically – in its expression, there are vectors of commonality to be found. It isthose vectors that brought together this gathering of serpentine voices under theTraditional Witchcraft landmarks: blood, night, land and crossroads.The other blood can be passed on horizontally, blood to blood, flesh to flesh, it canalso be awakened by the celestial fire. Within whom and where this fiery blood isquickened is bound to give a unique expression, because Traditional Witchcraft is apoetic reality of night and nature that, whilst adopting various guises, gives form to thepossibility of the incursion of the other. It is here we find the nerve of the Craft. It is thesong of those who cross hedge and veil, it is the fire of those who make their fate and itis the memory of blood and need making signs across the scales of the earth ... My ownperception of traditional craft has developed over nearly two decades. In this time Ihave been blessed to meet pilgrims and masters of what I term the craft of the wise.Like many I became aware of the term traditional witchcraft through the letters andwritings of Robert Cochrane and my search was rewarded by encountering a host ofwonderful practitioners of the art, where kinship was mutually recognised.

It is in such a situation I am glad, blessed and blissfully accursed to find myselfin today.It is a situation I have always longed for. Upon my early steps in pursuit of the oldwitch's path, I made many little journeys, out from the small family cottage, and awayfrom the village as dusk began to creep across, transform and moisten the land and thevery air. Along little-travelled, narrow footpaths I slowly passed, flanked by tallCornish hedges; thick with thorn, furze and bracken, with long, vicious tendrils ofbramble spanning the way and impeding one's progress. Out upon the high windsweptcarns, or the dramatic granite bolder-strewn and towering sea cliffs, or through themany mist shrouded fields, bordered each by their black thorny hedges, breached hereand there by old granite stiles. It is here, in these lonely places, amidst the dancing batsand ghostly owls that I immersed myself in and imbibed deeply of the spirit of place,via which much of my path and Craft was received and assimilated, building over timeinto fuller realisation.Those things thematic of the betwixt and liminal are old and recurrent threads withinwitchcraft, and they are avenues via which the witch accesses and employs the power,virtues and wisdom of the other as the source of all that informs their Craft and Arte.As the veil of dusk falls, the land is betwixt in anticipation of its parting throughwhich night emerges; bringing another world of subtle voices and mystery that speak tothose with the inner quietness to listen. These things and those who have a naturalaffinity for them are for profane and ‘normal’ society however, often viewed withsuspicion, fear, and even revulsion.Normal society's aversion to the night and the other, is revealed in its desire to keepits civilised urban areas in constant light, and its desperate rites to banish, fend off andexorcise the mysterious and subtle virtues of natural night via the vulgar and loudexuberance of urban nightlife. The participants in this rite arm themselves with athumping cacophony of noise, flashing lights of multi-colour and chemical intoxicationto a climax of violence amongst themselves, and rolling around in their own and otherparticipants’ excreta in the gutters of civilisation. Such are the rites that indeed repelthe witch."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Many are the ways in which the other is sought in the witch's Craft, but our First Wayis the witch's exilic and lonely pilgrimage to the places of intersection and power. In thetradition of the Cornish witch, and indeed in that of the witches of other areas, suchplaces include the crossroads, the churchyard, the lonely and wind-distorted thorn, thepotent stone, the holy well, the hill, and in the caves of sea and land, and the woodedvalleys and streams of spirit force.The lonely places to which the witch may make her nocturnal pilgrimages are liminalin nature, for it is the purpose of these journeys to encounter the virtues and wisdoms ofthe other, and the liminal and betwixt has always served as an intersection between theworlds. It is here, in the places wild and between, that the witch seeks to commune withand receive teaching and guidance from the spirits and the faery, and here the telluricserpent is drawn forth that intoxicates and brings vision and power to the witch.Thus it is that the wild and lonely place calls to the witch and is her true home; theearth is of her bones and the bones of her ancestors, and carried within the witch-bloodis the chthonic and animalistic wild wisdom to be realised, fed and nurtured via thewitch's arte. Thus it is also that the witch displays a kinship with animal familiars, eachbeing liminal in nature and character.Perhaps most visually suggestive of liminality is the hedge, and in particular the oldstone stiles that grant passage from one side to the other. As dusk seeps across the land,the Cornish witch settles upon the old stile, there to draw upon the potencies and visionsof the spirit paths, and there to wait for a passing spirit to draw wisdom from. It is alsofrom the hedge that the witch may receive the gifts of working tools to aid the workingof her Craft and of course the herbs and plants to stock and empower it.The plants that give unto the witch the gifts of vision and nocturnal spirit flight arethere to be found also in hedge and wood. Reviled by the profane for their poisonousreputations, it is fitting that these green gifts should grow in exile in the hauntedwilderness. Thus may their wise use by the witch be seen as a careful partaking andwitch's sacrament of the wild and other itself. Again we see that those things shunned asevil by the profane are in fact keys to vision, flight, power and gnosis.A point potent also of otherworldly intersection is the crossroads, a location with arich and ancient association with the dealings of witchcraft the world over.To the crossing of the ways travels the witch, to find the meeting of the worlds of theliving and the dead. It is here in the crossroad's sacred midst that one finds liminality,and unity of the opposing, for here rise the spirits of the dead and the other into theworld manifest, or it is here that the witch may shed her physicality to ride forth uponthe spirit paths of night. Here, betwixt All, at the point of one is true communion made.It is for good reason that the centre of the crossed ways is spoken of amongst thewitches as the fertile plot, for where all conjoin and emerge in unity is the true point ofall potential. The circle, the cross, and the point teach that All is one, thus the fertileplot is a place of life and death, creation and putrefaction, the receiving of gifts and the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"giving of sacrifice, and here may the witch, by arte, conjure forth or cast away inbanishment. Always in such work must the crossroad's nature as a point also of sacrificebe remembered, where the cost of our decisions and choices must be contemplated – forthere is always a price to pay for dealings at the crossroads. Here kindles the witch thehood-fire that consumes and bears forth; the flame of wisdom, sacrifice andtransformation, and here raises and reveres the witch the old signs of the phallus and ofthe skull, the signs of fertility with its requisite virtues of growth and repose, the signsof the old one of the light of life and the mysteries of death, crowned with the horns ofthe duality's union. Here, at the old fertile plot and the crossing of the ways, dwells theDevil indeed, he who stands at the threshold of All, and chases death into life and lifeinto death at the thinning of the veil.The figure of the Devil, and the old god of the witches, shall be found most often tobe represented in liminal form, intermediate between man and the bestial, with horns,cloven hooves, and a tail. The flame-eyed and fur-thighed wild spirit of nature, fertilityand death, he is often also blackened as night – the black bull, hound, goat or toad, orriding a black mare – thus is the Devil depicted as a vivification and avatar of the nightand the other. Also one may find that his eyes burn with a strange fire, or that smokyfumes issue forth in his breath, and of course there is the luminous flame set betwixt thehorns. Such imagery conveys to the witch the light of union and gnosis concealed withinthe Devil's mysterious and darkened form. Thus black tapers are burned by the witch inoffering to the Goat of the Sabbat. Here is an occult embodiment of the spiritualillumination concealed within the night's wild, lonely and haunted places of the other.With the crossroads, the churchyard overtly shares its associations as a place wherethe worlds of the dead and the living meet, and where the West Country witch may holdpatient vigil, or make active conjuration for the spirits to reveal wisdom. Bothcrossroads and churchyard are set apart and taboo, keeping the spirits of the deadcontained and separate from the world of the living. To this place the witch may alsotravel under night's cloak to hold conference with the Devil, who has appeared to theCornish witch who calls him forth in the guise of the black bull, or the great dark toad.Akin with the crossroads, the churchyard is also a place of rites and witch-magic, forthe receiving of gnosis, for transformation, and to make banishments of illness andthings undesired.In addition to the witch's dealings with the Devil and spirits of the dead, we find inCornish lore that the witch not only communes with and obtains power and wisdomfrom the potent and lonely places betwixt, but also from otherworldly and intermediatebeings such as mermaids, toads, and the faery folk who grant sight and convey gnosis.In Cornish folklore, we find what appears to be a pellar foundation myth in an oldman of Cury's encounter with a mermaid. In Robert Hunt's version of the tale, the manis walking in a day-dreamy, meditative state of mind upon the sands in one of theLizard Peninsula's coves, where he happens upon a mermaid stranded by the receding"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"tide. A bargain is struck with the half-human creature, and for returning her to the seathe man is granted the ability to exorcise black witchcraft, provide cures, and to divinethe identity of thieves and recover stolen things. These abilities were also to be passedto his descendants, thus have many Cornish magical practitioners traditionally claimedto be of the pellar bloodline of Lutey.The toad, one of the forms taken by the Devil, the witch's familiar, and the witchherself, is also encountered by the magical practitioner as an initiatory source of witch-power and gnosis, notably in the famous tradition of the nocturnal churchyardencounter. Beneath the lonely and wind-distorted whitethorn is where the Cornish witchwill go, under night's cover in genuflection to seek the magical assistance of the faeryfolk, or there to dream in hopes of receiving their wisdom and knowledge of such thingsas the curing of illness and other artes.Witch-emblems of the night and of nocturnal spirit flight are the owl and the bat. Aswell as their associations with the witch's secret journeys, and passage into the other,night and spirit flight are important aspects of traditional witch-magic. The witch'smagical intent is sent forth, often under the secrecy of night's cover, through the air, andupon the winds to its target. It is often carried forth by the witch's familiar spirit, orconveyed by the witch herself, traversing the spirit paths in bestial form.Curse magic is, in the West Country, called owl blasting or owl blinking – descendingwith fixed focus upon its target with the stealth and silence of the owl.Malefic magic, or evil spirits that fly through the night were guarded against by allmanner of precautionary charms and countermeasures. In Cornwall, it is interesting thatone charm to guard against all evils that travel forth by night, consists of a pair of bat'swings, enclosed within a small bag and hung above the hearth, the chimney being atraditional point of entry into the home by spirits, witches and their magic.Travelling, and sending their magic forth upon the winds of night, alike unto themovement of spirits, or traversing the ways in bestial form, it is not surprising that thewitch should be seen to be not entirely human, but of the family of spirits and beasts.The boundary between the witch and the familiar spirit is very blurred indeed; the greattoad making a sudden appearance to frighten those who have done some wrong unto thewitch, may be the witch's familiar or it may be the skin-turned witch herself. The witch-lore of Cornwall and beyond is full of stories of the toad being wounded or killed, or thestrange white hare being shot by the hunter, only for the witch later to be discovered ina corresponding state.The very body of the witch was itself a spirit house for her familiar spirits, for shecarried them within her. This was the belief of the modern English Cunning Man andWitchcraft Museum founder Cecil Hugh Williamson, who encountered and gainedknowledge from many of the West Country's working wise-women and witches.Between the witch and her familiar spirits there is only unity, any separation ordistinction would be very difficult, if not impossible to make."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Concealment, secrecy, and the keeping of silence are central tenets of the traditionalwitch's Craft, one of the old skills of which was the ability to turn invisible, the highlyuseful ability to pass by and go about one's business unnoticed.Just as the being of the witch is a concealment of her Craft and Arte and her familiarspirits, it is also very difficult to make distinction or separation from the night, aconcealment of the other and the light of otherworldly gnosis and spirits. Between thewitch and night there is only union, and it is in invocation of this union that the witchenters into the night, concealed by cloak and mask. By such an invocation does thewitch seek herself to become a living avatar of the night, the other, the fertile plot andthe dark womb of Chaos from which all magical potential of the witch's Craft may beborn forth in magical creation. The witch's envelopment in the cloak, the transformationinto bestial form via magical rites and the donning of masks, skins and horns, are sacralacts of the dissolving of one's self into the night, to become one with the other and thehidden.Clad so in the skins of the night, the witch becomes a vessel for its wisdom, itspowers and its spirits, and these, treading the sinistral dance of return, she calls forth insilence to be made manifest, stirring the dark depths of the cauldron that hangs abovethe fire at the crossing of the ways.The invocation of, and communion with the night made, the witch's mystic vision andsecond sight is opened, aided further by the serpent-tides of the year and the observanceof high nights, being themselves times betwixt. Thus may the channels of otherworldlycommunication be brought to flow.Emblematic of both the stripping of self, and exchange with the world of spirit, is thepresence within the witch's circle of skulls and bones, of either man or beast. Just as thewitch becomes a vessel for the night's gifts, so do the flensed bones that serve as toolsof the witch's art, set upon the cross-marked earth in the north of the circle, become re-fleshed as mediating vessels for the presences, spirits and virtues of the other.The northern direction is the dark portal of spirit wisdom, divination and whisperingson the wind. The flame set there to burn by the witch is kindled for the illumination ofthe flow of the otherworldly, spirit presences, and gnosis; a shedding of light upon theun-manifest, unknown and hidden, and a flame of devotion to the other.Set into the earth, at the crossing of the ways and beneath the hood-fire, is the ironwitch's nail; the serpent-seed and lightening bolt, uniting the worlds and drawing thehidden upon the paths of spirit into the centre, into manifestation.The flame kindled in the North is also maintained in honour of the North's status as thesource of mystic light, and is in acknowledgement also that the dark northern directionof death mysteries and transformation is the direction of the birth of light. Midwinter,whose direction is North in the witch's round, gives birth unto the sun and the increaseof the year, the dark bears forth the light, as from the womb, or the seed bursting forth"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"to emerge from the dark moist earth. The dark of the north and night bears the light ofspirit gnosis, the dark of midwinter bears the light of the sun anew, and the dark of thewitch's cloak conceals the body of witch-fire.To the witch who sees that All is One, the divine seed is present in all things from thehighest to the lowest. The wisdom of the interconnectedness of all is expressed withinthe witch's reverent finding of the divine light within those dark things commonlyviewed as evil and unworthy by the profane. A classic symbol of this within the oldcraft of the witch is of course the toad, that dark creature passing with impunitybetween the worlds. For the witch, unification, the presence of the divine within all, andlight from the dark, forms part of the occult arcana of the toad. Thus does the witchrevere toad, earth, and stone. By the witch practice of letting forth one's blood upon theblack earth, and unto the old stone altars, does the witch feed, enflesh, and unite withthe serpent and the fire concealed within.The traditional witch's nature is revealed in many of the facets of her Craft. The WestCountry witch was not entirely a pagan in the modern sense in which the word ispopularly used, but more a dual observer, in which the Devil was the old one of theearth and the hidden world within nature. The witch made use of all that was of use, andsimply employed Christian themes and practices in a way that suited her needs.Indeed the witch's apparent dual observance, and use of both Christian and paganmagical formulæ is betwixt; a unification of things thought by others to be entirelyincompatible polar opposites, good and evil.The witch might also be seen to stand astride the ways of good and evil, via herholistic embrace of magic, both white and black. In the West Country, the true breed ofwitch was known as a grey or double ways witch.The witch's path is trod with feet in different worlds, and leads to the wisdom andgifts of the physical and the other. Upon this old path of exile, through the lonely, wildand haunted places of the earth, the witch, a creature of nature, is truly at home and onewith all between the worlds and accompanied by the hidden; thus never alone, butalways one. A RITE OF THE STILE AND THE CROSS or this work, shall the witch venture forth betwixt day and night unto an oldstone stile set within some lonely hedge, or to some other place vivifyingliminality. Bearing the lit lantern and the staff, and carrying the blade of arteand a bottle of some good drink, let the very treading of the journey become ameditative act and an inner conjuration of the other and of Oneness, the state betwixt.When the old stile has been reached, let the witch be settled upon it, there to furtherthe conjuration of Becoming. There shall the witch breathe deep and imbibe of thedarkling air, of the black earth and the cold stone, drawing of the fire therein concealed.Let each breath serve to fan the witch-fire; becoming as a spirit-beacon of haunting"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"luminosity in the waxing of night, as the witch merges with the green and black of thehedge, and with the nocturnal creatures, busied creepy-crawlies and hidden presences.Let the witch, so transformed, with staff mark the cross of One; the meeting of theways upon the earth path before her. Let her take up then the blade of arte, and draw adrop of her fiery blood to fall forth upon the midst of the cross. Then upon this let thelantern be set as the witch does conjure:A rider astride the hedge,A watcher ‘twixt the thorns,A traveller in stillness upon the paths of One,With eye cast between the ways to the realms beyond profane sight,I conjure and bid open the serpent paths of night.I conjure thee O witch's lamp; arise ye O hidden light of the wise,Illumine the ways of blessing and curse; the crossing of the ways,Unto my senses all I conjure thee O spirits, presences and potencies,Who move abroad by night,To secret vision show, or hid’ word convey,By fleeting shade or fullest form, by wind carried whisper or a cry to chill the bone!I conjure thee forth by lamp by rod and blooded cross!So Shall it be!The staff is struck thrice on the ground, and there shall the witch, with her own firekindled by her sacrifice upon the black earth unto her kin, the ancestors, the spirits ofthe ways, and the serpent fire, imbibe further of this union with the other and herrealization of oneness at centre and point of all potentiality.Seeking vision and word in the dancing shadows cast by the lantern, or in the windsand movements of the wild, the witch is open unto the flow of otherworldly wisdom, theguiding spirits of place and its potencies and virtues. Learning and empowerment viasuch exchange are traditional hallmarks of the witch."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Spirit of True BloodFIATTEMPTED a vague description of She who above all others is deemedIneffable, it might be: the Uncreated, Bornless, Eternal, Un-diminishing,All-generating, Un-limiting Absolute Sentient, Ambivalent Multi-verse ofBeing. Yet description fails utterly, for, without exception, words andimages are self-limiting and finite. Beyond All, She can be neither. Humankind intandem with all other material form created within our universal existence is a selfperpetuating sequential cycle of life and death. Non-material forces are likewise self-generating and eternal; yet both force and form arise from the singularity termed (forour recognition and distinction only as) the Uncreated Absolute. To express thisintellectualised perception of perennial philosophy yet further in ever more personalterms, humanity instigated the Grand Pantheonic Narrative. The veneer of culture is buta veil to the Truth, the Singularity above analogous mediation.So could it be rationally argued that archetypes can model those pantheons withoutpre-existence as divine forces or be-cause of them? Do those archetypes act then asprimordial forces; given form and clothed with cultural character, thereafter elevated toa (post-creation perception of a) ‘divine’ status? Humanity's struggle to comprehend itsself perceives these external influences upon things of this material plane in terms ofour inter actions with other humans according to our allotted fates. So my questionpresses deeper; are these archetypes, as emanations of the Uncreated like ourselves,products of manifest creation as form, or are they created as both manifest and un-manifest principles of force and form?All life is inseparable, our ancestors knew this instinctively. Everyone in the ancientworld recognised a pattern of similarities in their perception, in number and quality.Unilateral virtues became deftly woven into all myth and legend as tenets of necessity,granting some measure of validation regarding their ‘reality’ at some level. Too often,this resource has been forgotten and neglected over time.All epithets for Wyrd reflect a personification of the inexorable bound through timeas a nebulous expression that ironically becomes intimately personalised throughspecific family spirits, of ancestral links in time. Eventually all views coalesce intofewer and fewer until they become one influential recognisable force. From this we mayconfidently deduce how twenty-four original tribal ancestors became associated byobscure, elemental forces of nature as active filters and channels for the TriuneExemplars of Absolute Fate. Fate is therefore embodied yet further as an impalpableambivalence closer and higher even than the Ultimate Creatrix.Pondering upon these views, we seek their clarification in beliefs that reflect them."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Our engagement within the Work is filtered by what we are, in the sense of how we areto be known: definition is requisite. Subscription to either of the following possibleexamples that label the complexity of our belief as either Henotheistic Panentheism orMonolatrous Paganism (in a totally non neo-pagan manner) asserts that in fact, we areneither. More properly, we should posit an Ecumenical Gnosticism in absolute contra-distinction to any deviant historical corruptions of what essentially describes a non-elitist, non sectarian confederacy of people who speak the word of truth in the absolutesense and who are fully immersed in the Mysteries. To that end we become defined insimpler terms as a Mystery Tradition.Under that veil, we offer only one of many ways towards the discovery of that reality,whether such be termed Individuation or a Grail Attainment. All things shift and bloomin grace alone. So we neither profess to be The Way, nor hold a definitive apprehensionof those ineffable challenges borne of the Faith. Effectively, our Compass is timelessand universal, yet equally it becomes honed to ancestral vision though a collectivehistory forged within Northern Europe. We are in Craft, mystics, pilgrims, warriors,artisans, occultists and shamans. We are also none of these, for all labels stifle growth.Numerous cultures and past beliefs have been raised upon gnostic foundationsirrespective of later developments. It is a discipline of the self, but not in terms of egoobsession, but ego transmutation; it is a purely scientific process. Rigor and staminaprovide the stoic reserve of seekers set upon this stony path; for crooked it is not, butarduous, unappreciated, oft reviled and all too zealously polemicised.In this rapidly shifting arena of tradition and definition, clearly, the question of whatqualifies as witchcraft particularly with regard to the beliefs and practises of Gerald B.Gardner and Roy Bowers needs to be reassessed. Moreover, despite in-depthclarification throughout the works of Roy Bowers, whose own frustrated tiradesacknowledge the liminality of credulity in matters of Faith, his own opinions have beenmuch distorted and misrepresented among the greater occult communities. Time then toredress such ill conceived constricting perspectives. As individuals can we ever defineand categorise the totally subjective experiences within the personal and intimatemodes of contact with which we engage the other? Surely this would defeat the purposeof growth? This indefinable something may at best be aligned to a stream, a pattern ofsimilarity and no more.Looking into historical patterns of emergent Gnosticisms during the pre-Christianapocalyptical eras, we may discover how Platonic philosophies infused were artfullylifted by a subtle interweaving of Hermetics to form a base pattern of enfolding orientalmystery traditions. In modern times, vague and subjective categories by exampleinclude terms such as Traditional Witchcraft and these do not serve us well. TraditionalCraft becomes however an altogether more promising toponym offering progressiontowards a more succinct definition to distinguish ourselves from the wholly undesirablemaledictions that typify historical witchcraft."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Craft is the thread that thrives as an underground stream. Its fierce abnegation ofdogma offers succour that generates a mystical path, of hermitage and evolution. Itssource honours the pagan spirit, yet seeks the transcendent infusion that ignites thoseanimisms. It presents to every seeker an objective goal that allows their subjective needfor a devotional path to overwhelm and elevate them as journeymen upon a road sharedby others of similar vision ... it denies no-one, yet accepts only those who grasp thethorn. It is in fact the magic of the soul, a spiritual alchemy masterfully borne in thecrafting of matter.In this the tenets of Craft shape and hone such a questor. Each and every individualbecome recognised by ancestral forces as dynamic catalysts for their growth and well-being. The spiritual forces that guide them, better defined as the Egregore, are theintrinsic cellular well-spring of regeneration. As occult potencies these concepts areoften mis-understood by many whose personal preferences for all things macabredemean them into the realm of superstition. Therefore the Craft again becomes a meansof ingress. But it is not one engrossed in material thaumaturgy, nor maleficent acts, soagain defies any label linked to witchcraft in any relative literal or psychological sensewhatsoever.Fundamental to everything metaphysical, the animistic principle remainssupernaturally axiomatic to True Virtue everywhere; it cannot be otherwise. In thearchaic world any unsophisticated religion outside the imperial or state judiciary, as anon-state religion, would be deemed as pagan. This correct definition is rather differentto that defined in the modern neo-pagan sense. Only animism allows and accepts thespirit of virtue in all things, a caveat both Roy Bowers and Evan John Jones were verycautious to express. Mindful lest they be mistakenly considered pagan in true 18thcentury idyllic fashion, they strived to separate their perception in contradistinction tothat same example revived and revamped by Gardner quite successfully.This contemporary of Bower's rose in prominence to assert a constant reminder of thegulf in belief that separated their praxis. Neither men shared Valiente's vision of aunilateral term, where differences in principle become less important than those whichunify the broader spectrum of ‘pagan belief.’ This issue remains unresolved as neo-paganisms continue to factionalise into unceasingly smaller sub-groups and culticorders. As the former Magister of the Clan of Tubal Cain, Evan John Jones becameinfluenced by Doreen Valiente during the few years they were called upon to workclosely on writing projects that included their book, WitchCraft: A Tradition Renewed.Some of his writings therefore bear opinions seemingly at odds with his own moreforthright appreciation of his Craft. Having caused certain confusions for thoseanalysing his collective works perhaps unaware of those brief influences, it is worthremembering both John and Doreen worked closely with Roy Bowers and with eachother for a short time after Bowers’ tragic death. Hopefully this explanation will dispelall errors of judgment with regard to his uniquely original influence intrinsic to the Clan"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"mythos brought to bear upon the People of Goda, of the Clan of Tubal Cain.Returning very briefly to things of superstition known as the baneful plight, wediscover there is nothing new under the sun, quite literally. Plato especially struggled toexplain the presence of all things negative withholding their nature as not divine; andyet his explorations do suggest he found a harmony of sorts, but was afraid to fullyexpress them. In truth but few are brave enough to be martyrs; talkers, walkers even, butnot fighters whose end game surrenders all. Ambiguity hints enough to satisfy the needto be heard, but offers a shield to fend off those who do not understand such subtleties;a dead man tells no lies, but neither is he heard.Change as a necessity offers the idea of choice buffered as an illusory reassurance toprotect the ego from accepting its enforced subjugation to anything less than free will.All is meant to be, I believe. So I am of the opinion that no opinion serves, andtherefore no answer is correct, nor is it wrong. Change is inevitable, the illusion ofchoice suggests the persistence of a comfort zone unchallenged by an inability to inflictresistance to any perceptible effect ... the subtle difference lies only in my avoidance ofthe subject of ego and the matter of ‘free’ will – outwardly only of course.Language is so easily a device of ambiguity; direct address is oft preferred, as that,unaided, leaves little room for doubt. All statements are by definition a commentaryborne of the flux of necessity, subject to individuality of purpose, idiosyncratic of andsubject to the independent right of every individual. Even minor manipulation changesthe manner in which words are received, thus shifting their impact. Vision must besincere and without guile or artifice. But the Word, the gospel of the breath, needs to bedelivered with all the subtle and noble arts of rhetoric much loved by all teachers ofphilosophy, whose faith infuses every lesson with the pure and holy fire of the priest.When talking to those sleepers not yet awakened, the charge to memory requires adifferent approach, a challenge to predictive cognition. This effects a tactic of confusionwherein the seeker becomes one among many where: some have no filters, other havetoo many, some have no need of them for their blindness gives them inner vision.It has always been thus. Therefore, even as a thought carried upon the breath thatfinds expression as syllabic form, the spoken word is no exception to this most basictenet. Hence, my most valued lesson gleaned from the invaluable outpourings ofThomas Aquinas concerns his realisation with regard to how those who understand hiswords, do not really have need of them, yet to others who cannot, his words are useless!He had their measure of course, but still conceded that in each piece of writing be itgood or bad, at least one person will read what they need rather than what they desire orwant.

As no single isolated thing it is cumulatively the summation of all these ideas andyet transcendent of them. For All is one. Humankind alone sets a mutually exclusiveprecedent. In choosing to exclude all forms of itself and the other from its totality ofbeing, it asserts a negation of unity and of completion, all to serve instead the ego,building upon self and perception of self ad finitum. Yet to fully sense all others, wemust propel what is within and without; to be filled, we must first empty. Few will takethat as a gift. For many, it is their greatest fear.It has been very successfully argued that everything resides in polarity. Beyond that,a third and equilibrating force exists primarily based upon the interactive friction of thetwo opposing forces of polarization. This fulcrum requires distribution via the flow andebb of a tide due to the dark and light of shade and radiation. One is void without theother; neither completing their purpose without the other.Again, Evan John Jones was most insistent upon this primary tenet, claiming itinherent to the dialectical mechanistic methodologies processed all too often withinTraditional Witchcraft as occultisms. Devoid of intellectualizations, we strive together,with partners (if possible) and alone to enable us to experience the variant expressionsof our Faith. Each dynamic is essential for holistic epiphany. Group dynamicsencapsulate the network of Wyrd, an innate sense of belonging, a profound unity ofcamaraderie and brotherhood within that inspires our deepest vision. In our partners, wediscover the Self. Alone we discover Truth.Traditional Witchcraft is essentially a praxis instigated by one person, commonly,and two or more persons but rarely. Gnostic tradition by contrast, avows a brethren.Traditional Craft however is represented by the tau and the crescent, the stand and thearc as a place of meeting and of working where all ritual is prayer. Albeit for many, nolonger. A marriage of such intimacy, once infused with hermetic principle, establishes aperfection within the harmonic conjunction of opposites where Self becomes voidedthrough ecstasy. It is Apollonian and Dionysian; the heart and mind. Neither is separateof nor subject to the other.Consequently, as none of us (including Roy Bowers and Evan John Jones) has everconsidered ourselves as Traditional ‘Witches,’ I am grateful we may continue under thegreater and more ambiguous term of Traditional Craft. Both men asserted suchdescriptive terms were applied by others external to our Craft. Our preferred idiomexpounds a collective tradition, a faith, and a craft as pilgrims in pursuit of theMysteries. This arcane tradition serves well its gnostic heritage, a gift beyond measureand a blessing treasured beyond mundane kenning.In essence we are not kin nor are we kith to any Craft of witchery.

Sacred journeys begin with mind-ful instruction of requisite cosmologiesbefore venturing forth upon individual or collective vision quests.

Known as the Man in the Moon, heacknowledges our errors, improperly deemed sins. These we seek always to correct ouraim, to realign our self in tandem with our Wyrd.We judge only ourselves, as it must be, and if we do not attain mastery of our self,then we must affirm acceptance of the self and move on from that point next time weremember it. It is to commit to memory the journey and so lessen the term of eachsubsequent return. All is lost to the Lethe if we do not at least keep this in mind-fulawareness. So that is the first goal. The moon-sphere is where we use that mirror to seethe self truly, inside, to drop all feigned shadow and light, but to know thyself. There isno passage beyond the moon if we seek Her reflection only.To that end, we have just one guardian, through whom all possible aspects radiate totheir relative and appropriate station meeting each departing soul individuallyaccording to its own level of attainment. The Hound spoken of by Roy Bowers and EvanJohn Jones is the Egregore that oversees all, permeating each thread of the tapestrywoven by each individual who lighted upon this strand of Wyrd together. As aconglomeration of memory within a protective form via sublunary experience, theHound manifests through the (Group) Mind, the objectivity of consent. The discerningself is the lack of surrender – in other words, the resistant Self opted to remain as thataspect of the group mind required to prevent external and incompatible forcesencroaching within. Similarly the guard at the gate is Trust, again generated from Mindconjoined within the other. That bond masks fear, which is doubt, doubt and fear shatterTruth. Only lack of Trust negates entrance.All true pilgrims must prevail. A very wise person once assured me that we are allhere because we failed. The object therefore, is to learn and move on. The web draws ustogether where we gaze through Her veil to envision the same truth. Our scars will fadein the tears shed by memory. Tears of salt are the symbol of man's labour – the work ofthis realm; sweet tears the symbol of bliss – the work of the other realm. Bitter aloesand honey are the matter of The Work. The difference exists only in this realm wherethe memory of life and its value are borne aloft, a perfect gift of surrender to Her bywhom these fruits are rendered sacred.

All these concepts are the gift and remit of the archaicgoddess of sacrifice who taught this function and format to the first of our kind. It is inthat space, that moment of time where infused by ancestral wisdom, we draw from itspool to accomplish needful things through learned instruction and inspired direction.Compound formulae illustrate such wisdoms though symbolic elements andillustrative tableaux. Salt, sulphur and mercury offer three of the five alchemical statesthat process matter along with the soul and spirit to configure the realms of life, sleepand death. My own instinctive choices place them as follows: salt is the earthlycorporeality, all matter; sulphur is the fiery, etheric soul in ascent. Mercury completesthe human compound as the mind, quicksilver of spirit and plasticity of the astral. Yetall make up the complex layering of The World Tree: the waters of the mercurial wellare present as the font of all wisdom, the sulphuric tree as the anima mundi, and salt ofthe earth as all the crystalline forms of life itself.She leads and we follow; we are at any one time, exactly where we need to be in orderto glimpse that small speck in the formation of our Wyrd. Beyond that, do we need towitness all force? No? Truth is alone profound. Yet we attempt to understand it, butprocess is inadequate, wholly so and exactly why Roy chose to abandon reason,surrendering to Faith, falling into Her Truth, the absu void. How wonderful is this giftof grace? Some are born knowing and others die seeking; some are born certain andothers die perplexed; some are simply aware and others have yet to become. We eachperceive best that view which accommodates our present; the future is spun from theweave of that discovery. Personal struggle presents the biggest hurdle to ourachievements. We are all seeking, not the fact of or actuality of the divine, but itsabsorption into our full awareness.So, having briefly been introduced to the function and purpose of both Egregore andHound, we may now look to She whose name within our kinship is not widely knownwithout. Her triune form is (perceived) aspected in conjunction with the personalDæmon (divine self) and the Egregore together. Beyond that She is infinite. The internaldæmon as a distinct part of an individual filters through Her to that innermost part ofone's soul, immersed within the World Soul, mind to All Mind. Between both extremes,intermediaries exist as named filters, others as hierarchies of force.Certain ancestral family names are used to personalise orlog (duty to Law) as Wyrd(overcoming of Fate). Many epithets are accepted as given names that are bestunderstood as personal aspects of the Fates and of Primal Law.

We can onlybegin to apprehend them by individual and personal experience of them, directly. In thatinstant alone, a level of truth pervades the psyche. Thus I may fail to communicate whatI know and feel but cannot hope to convey. Yet that hope pervades as latent desire, adreamy wish percolating as personal impetus, fuelling remote though not randomexpression. Because we are a Clan covenanted through its egregore, the agencies withinit are required to fulfil the historical and mythical requisites. In a postmodernist world,that is an arduous quest.As awareness deepens, our visionary connections enable ever greater clarity. Shereveals further diversity of form, forging the rainbow bridge between the realms of themanifest and un-manifest realities. Refracted through this bridge of glass, She falls intothe spark within, attracted by Her reflection there, completing Her image, but never aswe imagine Her. To each of us, She reveals the inner self. The hidden soul we have yetto discover, void of ego, the pool of Memory.one other profound question I was once asked to consider concerned the immortalityof the Goddess of Love, She alone who is all beauty. Was Her exception to annihilationbecause as Love, She is the first and last desire? My thoughts on this regard Hereffectively as alpha-omega. All forms of love and all virtue survive therein; all forms oftheir opposites, equally and regrettably so. For though virtue induces aspiration, withoutbalance, without harmony, there is only pre-determination, which is not the same aspre-destination. One is doom, the other its causality.All things must then survive.The void is the pleroma of all things.She/He form the ambivalent fulcrum of desire, the nux and nub of a needful entirety.We choose instinctively our impetus for love or hate, desire or need. Deny thatchoice, and we deny the reciprocal promise of evolove. The all is all, and all is one andall alone and ever more shall be so. This bliss is our release. Our conjunction in Truth isa convocation of Love and Beauty. In seeming paradox, Love conquers all and that lovesurvives in humanity for we are the World Soul. In fact, all the ‘gods’ exist, thriving infact, for they are the clothing of spirit in likeness of their primal templates. But ofthese, love is the strongest and is eternal. Those saturated in Her, sacrifice all andbecome Her ... For I am the womb and the tomb together.So in a phantasmagoria of projected creation, it is less bizarre perhaps than at firstcould be imagined to have a wind deity as the apical ancestor of the Clan; for She is, inthat final primal and historical sense, deemed as such. From within those noteworthy"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"and sacred twenty four lamps, arcs of heavens, three reign supreme. These ideas,unquestionable among our ancestors challenge irrefutably our modern sensibilities. Yetthe very premise of all existence and its creation rests upon just such magic.Coupled to this we must consider the relevance of the divine self, often discussed interms of the higher self being that part of ourselves recognised during its conjunctionwith the other. To amass ‘form’ a deific character reflects its essence complimentaryand completes itself within, unlike the primal self, the true self; this other is a force that‘fits’ the divine self, a harmonic of like, of kindred vibration.Though we are not divine in the sense that is eternal and uncreated, we form a hostfor it, if you will, not so much a construct as a matrix that lends form to the divine selfis that part always connected in awareness to The Divine. It has no form or identity; theindividual divine self perceives an identity drawn from the many emanations of thedivine that we are able to harmonise with. Filtered through the Clan Egregore, Sheflows, undiminished as the personal link bridging communication between thehigher/divine self and the divine itself. Many choose to ignore this reality and sublimepersonal interaction – a true gift beyond measure.This explanation is the only one that ever made sense to rational intellect also; thedivine self is simply not ‘The Divine,’ as assumed by so many. How could it be? Nor isthe Divine the clothes we weave for it, it is all and none of these things. The divine selfis only the housing, the layer of the self able to hold the divine in awareness and thusreceive a more personal sense of something that is essentially ambivalent.Ironically, other forms of the Divine Feminine present in their all too human qualitiesa deity of uninspiring generality. For example, though Bertcha/Bertha/Pertcha wasprobably the most conventional form of a goddess across Iron Age Europe, with Freyaand Frigga as yet barely known, within a few decades both had surpassed Pertcha'spopularity. Due to distinctly ‘female’ qualities in addition to their archetypal adherenceto all former ‘motherly’ (sic) qualities much as Isis and Venus, they triumphed overothers of their own time. Confirmation is rarely so blatant here ex-emplifies to whatextent we clothe our gods according to evolving needs. I think Roy Bowers and EvanJohn Jones also understood this very well.Clearly we do not then invent our gods, nor do we re-invent them, we merelyremember them, in joyful anamnesis. We need them to access the vast cultural treasuressuspended in myth and legend, for in that ancestral world, steeped in a faith we cannoteven begin to comprehend, insidious superstition and fear raged rampant. Although wehave failed to completely eradicate these fugue ridden filters from the credulous, wemay still witness how awe and faith retain their place as knowledge applied throughthose experiences surrendered in complete trust.In descent along the golden chain of being, all force is squeezed down the line; oncesubject to design it imposes itself as form, that we might better know it, accept it andcommunicate to and through it.

All wecan do is attempt some sensible measure and allow the All to work its Magics; itsPresence and its Reality convey its Truth. For though in our own era, we are a vastpopulace, in simpler times, long past, everyone stoically believed their genesis occurredfrom just seven or twenty-four tribes. Such hoary memory ascribes divinity of a kind toapical man, whose obligation is to forever act as dutiful intermediary to all whothereafter bear that name.From within the pages of old diaries recently discovered is described there among myscribblings, a pledge made almost three decades ago to what was then perceived as atriune ‘British Creatrix’ who was composed of Minerva, Brigantia and Sulis, nowcognate in my understanding in essence as Skulde, Weorthunde and Urdhr. All aremathematically tenable through their associated numbers of 24, 12, 7, 3, all risinginstinctively from and of the natural forces of this Fair Isle. Furthermore, these numbersrelate to man's own observation of patterns and repetitions in nature, bringing ourappreciation of them as manifest expressions of the divine to the fore. Her breath isancient indeed. As Vac in Sanskrit She is Truth expurgated as creation. Her nameencapsulates these virtues as subjective and inspired media of application.She has no absolute name; sensing Her is enough. She needs no name to exist, nor tocreate; remember her maxim: For I am She who is older than time, I am She, I am womband tomb together, for I am All, yet I am No-thing. Many older workers of the Craftwould never utter Her name, in devout reverence. She is beyond all, so cannot belimited to a name. So first we go though Him, the challenger, the cajoler, the tricksterand tempter.Our Egregore draws back its own People bringing them home to be properly preparedto die, recognised and welcomed by ancestors of spirit and of blood. All are nourishedexponentially. This mystical path has little in common with either neo-paganisms orhistorical witchcraft. Neither pagan, nor witch then, we revel in our Craft as that of avestigial survival of the (British) Mystery Tradition. It was thus fifty years ago in RoyBowers’ term as Magister, and remains so now under Robin-the-Dart's.Angelic potencies perceived as ancestral spirits attached to Clan families are cited inancient source documents that describe Goda in terms of mind, of a protecting rationale,a central intelligence if you will.

Ida is notthe Creatrix but the source origin of the Egregore held within our mythos. Ida is ourpersonal name for the place of origin, the root of our being as a manifest living entity.The Source of All Being is not that. Ida is the name of our manifest origin. So it is"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"easily traced back to Meru, Turkey, all the mythical places people feel they hail from.Ida, better known as the Garden (its fruits and sustenance) of Edin (its boundaries,Mound and Maze) becoming the first place known to the first of our humaneforefathers.According to our mythos and ancestral culture, Ida is in one sense the parent of theClan, its origin, as homeland and birthplace. Ida is (the origin) filtered through the goda(brain and people of) Egregore, via the tutelary deity – named as Tubal Cain, the triunepromethean avatar, guiding light and abba. As a father (and son) figure, his role isanchored within the law of human endeavour. Through Alcis, the horse and Eiwaz, thetwins, both divine and mortal, by whose virtue we stand harkened, are we ascribed toone particular aspect of Him for all time, transcendent, singular and unchanging. As akenotheistic monolatry, He becomes very much a personal god, of presence andimmanence.She is however the great ‘grandmother’ the nuclear cell of our existence, the processorof our mind as it were – who we are. But from whence its spirit? We carry Edin withinthrough the Egregore. Beyond that, the Ultimate Source is that venerable obscureliminality of intangible ideals, the meter of silence as void of the lie. Art conceals themind's eye to reveal; the fragment of no-thing is everything, all beyond and all no-thing.As Mother of all Mothers, She is Fate or Providence.

She is All there is and can never be more or less than this. Sheis the perfect crystal, reflected through infinitesimal kalas radiating from each prismicshard of Beauty. Fragments suffuse the Universe, each speck reflects the whole. So it isless that Roy Bowers’ description refers to each individual facet perceived of Her, butmore that we open ourselves to Her Totality, through that very fragment gifted to us,utterly, without reservation. Every fragment is Her spark, Her personal fragment aglowwithin each of us. All humanity is illuminated by Her soul light. This is why we live inHer and She in us.Hidden along the lemniscate symbol of infinity are Her eight shades, fallen through Herveils to form the Compass – the Merkabah of Herself as vehicle and destination in one.She imbues the folkloric Valkyrie and the Disir with ancestral rights to call home theirown. Then in reflux, through the Mound, each Compass point reflects a deific femininefacet of Her. All is bound to that totality as manifest/unmanifest potencies. It is whydeath is not where expected and why Her Face of Beauty becomes the grimmr, the Maskof Death. It is the portal through which life and death merge, a vesica piscis of sorts.The round of life reflects perfectly within the Compass Rose of the people of Goda,termed by Roy Bowers as the necklace upon which the nine knots forms the brightestjewels. She beguiles us with Her fabulous necklace enchanted by its beauty. Yet I amreminded that as a symbol of Her virtue, it was more probably a girdle, or breastplatevery similar to that fiery ornament of authority, the mighty mind jewel worn byBrunhilde. Brisingamen, formed from Freyjas's tears of love shed as fire, hardened intoamber beads and then fashioned into Her girdle/breastplate. This means, like Inanna,she ‘holds’ the law, the authority of the Me and the spiritual intelligence of humankind.She is thus the patroness and protectoress of humanity also.Inanna's divinely gifted girdle, the supreme emblem of Her status was surrendered inorder that She might know death, that is mortality, the affliction of humanity, whosespirit alone is eternal. Official deposition of Sumerian law, the Ilu authority toimplement the sacred Me is envisioned in the status of Her true crown of qayinship.Granted dominion over three realms, Inanna became elevated as the Holy Queen ofHeaven, Earth and the Waters of the Underworld. Her gift acquired from Enkishadowing the similar odinic endowment was relinquished to enter the realm of death,the plane of non-being where the Laws of Manifest Nature no longer exert anyauthority.Brunhilde rejected the noose that bound her to those who might dishonour their oathsof fealty. Yet she humbly accepted a Troth ring. Although both halter and nooseperform the same function in form, their distinctive forces offer contrary intent. Oneonly apprehends Her girdle of stars where all souls are bound in a love knot of eternity.All bridges are constructs between one point and another.

Simply, this gift of Prometheus, is Hope.Her breath colours and transforms those qualities our senses record as experiences ofHim. His role as guide through all form is variable, adapted to the individual, just asperfume forms a unique synergy with each person using it. These adjustments fluctuateorganically to facilitate the requisite shift of each individual. Cosmology dictates afoundational framework, a typology corresponding to the topographical criteria for thepeople looking to these forms for guidance. Absence of diversity fails evolution. If thepresiding deity is of water consigned, its message would not be received in the desert.Something we had been probing, half blind, for some time, recognising but not withfull grasp until recently, was this very principle of adaptation. Despite Roy Bowers’lucid explanation of how myth and symbol engender paradigm shifts, we held only anintellectual appreciation of how extreme boundaries are required to retain coreintegrity. Discernible by general examples, that central tenet can easily becomecompromised when another seemingly random element is introduced. Taboo becomes asorely overwrought or underestimated facet of belief; it is one factor that stands proudin modern praxis as random.The historicity of Philosophy reveals its devolution through time and location,absorbed culturally where grafts are not always as seamless as would be desirable. Butthose nuances have become the subject of study rather than the structure. Just as thedivisive praxis of religion/faith has obfuscated perennial truth that myth records, thosemyths also speak of its complexities and trial in the hearts and minds of Humankind.One fine example describes the directive of certain missionaries involved in taking theEdinic myth to Africa, but the people there simply rejected the issue of Adam and Eve'snakedness. They rejected that as not breaking any godgiven taboo relevant to them andso replaced it with incest, making Adam and Eve siblings to one another. Thisfascinating shift in taboo parallels myths concerning everything, having connotations ofimmense significance within perennial philosophy. As the purpose of any myth is toretain its own integrity, it becomes fascinating to discover how that tenet, despite allapparent changes in structure, truly does remain intact.That incest as an arcane taboo became intrinsic within countless myths serves tofurther illustrate with considerable clarity this impetus of a paradigm shift within thetransport of myth. Taboo itself acts as supreme example in studies of the rigidity ofspecific frameworks built around a core principle for its supposed preservation. Quitequickly we are able to subtract the real nux concealed once within taboo through itsrepetition and patterning within relevant myth. This fundamental reflection asserts anoverarching principle of lateral perennial philosophy.Groping around another myth cycle concerning the dynamic of the Hero, Gawain andthe Green Knight offers a superb example of that same core principle, enabling us to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"distinguish its patterned matrix, its structural pattern of the cycles of death, of fate, ofinitiation and failure. This classic perspective focuses upon the year cycle at Arthur'scourt, of the quest of winter and summer. So, what was the central tenet? Taboo again,but this time of fealty, the honour of troth to one's liege lord and lady. The frameworkfor all myth is the formulae of retribution and loss the breaking of taboo unleashes.All things human interact at a soul level, without exclusive assignment to otherhumans, but to all those that include animals; in fact, all flora and fauna. We areunanimously compelled towards certain people, sometimes for a moment, sometimes awhile longer. Sometimes we are held forever, others never; for all share a collectivesentience albeit filtered within each of us along the way. Hence we must choosecarefully whom we work with and open to. There is much wisdom in the naiveté of thefool and also in the sage who plays one.It is written into our cosmology that we must work under the stars within a ring ofstones, hedged by trees and by a river if possible for all the above reasons. To feel theburning sting of wind, the play of moonbeam upon one's skin, to be awed by the grandvista of stars and to draw orgone from all around us, including each other isunmatchable by the craft of man. What finer temple than this our world, the seat ofHimself ensouled by Her, a fountain of earthly delights.The temple of the Shekinah is the Self in communion through all those media. Formany years ago we have asserted the favourable belief in animism as the greater andmore sophisticated of all comprehensions. It speaks to the soul on all levels, wheremonotheism fails utterly. Panentheism yields the realisation that everything is simplynot inhabited by god but is within god – is god in fact. The only way and the best way tolearn anything, how best to understand is to stand under it. There to be taken apart,turned over and come back to, yet beyond with knowing.This is also why the gnostic like the brahmin once insisted all devotional acts were heldin natural environs. In knowing lies true liberation. Many things will always appeal andseduce the mind, yet these things should be engaged and embraced; but never must weforget the needs of the soul to embrace spirit directly in true holy communion. All isgrist to the mill as Evan John Jones would say; all necessary for our winnowing oddly(or not) a process that engages the kernel being thrown up to the winds. It is all such a beautiful dance, this life, but only where we know the tune, the playersand the dancing floor ... beyond those bounds, the discordant cacophany jars the soul inflight.That the Ida priestess as Gaude/Fate instructs mankind on all arts of the Craft, isperhaps the singularly most important realisation achieved recently.

Several stone reliefs depict Iconicised saints as bridges up towards divine libertythrough their mutual virtues of faith, hope and charity. Faith manifests in the figure ofone saint in particular, that of John the Baptist.Another layer forges further connections again by the same three virtues albeit viathree canonised archangels; solar Mikael, the mercurial Raphael and the lunar Gabriel.Raphael, mentor to the young Tobias in the apocryphal Book of Tobit, instructs him inthe apothecial arts of alchemy, science and healing. Raphael is habitually depictedcarrying a pilgrim's staff and shares both Sun and Mercury interchangeably withMikael. The Planet Mercury rules over the Tree of Life Sephirah 8 (Hod – Splendor), the GreekDeity Hermes, the Alchemical Metal Quicksilver, and Reflective Intelligence.In Gnostic terminology, a fourth, the Holy Sophia as representative of Grace becomesessential in understanding the initiatory baptism administered through John, of Her holyfire. Mercury's vital angelic potency invites the void of intellect, by use of intuition.Starry Venus too beckons instinct for completion. These Three Queens of the Compassoffer water, air, and earth. Mikael brings Fire. Through sacrifice of intellect, piety anddevotion, a new shift into the origin of all things is facilitated. Remember, the end ofdesire (as per Thunder, Perfect Mind) is our willing surrender to be Hope for others.Our stoic conviction through Faith brings that Hope to others as we openly act asvessels of light.Through intellect we may fall first into Sophia, the primal other, though not theearthly Mother. We are wise indeed to consider how Sophia bore the soul, and spiritinto the flesh of Venus. We voyage around instinct and intuition back towards intellectto complete the rose. Sophia has for that reason alone in Her purity been the one whobreathed the desire, the potential, the need. But She is not Hope, She is forever fallen.We alone are hope; this was the divine gift to humanity.

There are many caves in the Pyrenees and some are more homethan others, but what they all share is that they serve as mouths formysteries, because in all caves Mari dwells and shields the world from thehunger of the earth's secret centre who breaths fog and flames beneath our feet. It was tothe cave that Mari sent her first human twins, Mikelats and Atarrabi, to be taught by thememory of light resting within the cave itself. Humanity was the child of light, a lightboth obscured and guarded by the many mothers of land and being, and from the cavewisdom and illumination was extracted. In a way we are all children of the cave, thedifference is that some of us still have a memory of this, whilst most have forgotten.In the mythologies of the world the cave represents a place where prophets are bornand visions are received. The seven dreamers spoken of in de Voragine's The GoldenLegends and Qur'an sura 18 were laid to rest waiting for Judgment Day in a cave. Saintssuch as John the Baptist and Elias gravitated towards the cave, the living tomb ofmankind, the uterus of the mothers. The cave is memory. It is here at the gates to thefire at the centre of the earth, which strikes to the inner sanctuary of God, wherewisdom dwells. In a world that worships ambition and selfishness, wisdom will oftenbecome a scapegoat for all that is wrong, and thus the cave becomes a gate of terror anddread.And so it is from the cave I write about the ways of the sorgin, as one who makes hisown fate and walks goose-footed across the worlds. Since it is from the caves I speak,riddle and silence will pass between words, because the sorgin exists under the Sun andlives under the Moon, a paradox and a truth which Francisco Goya expressed in hispaintings of the world of the other.Julio Caro Baroja and José Miguel de Barandiarán have written extensively about themythologies of the Euskaldunak, or the Basques if you prefer. They have demonstratedsensitivity to myth and legend and how it reflects the reality of the sorgin and in thishinted at the multiple possible readings. For us myth and legend riddles original truthand because the blood has given us a twin set of eyes, we can see the form and itsessence, just like a bull by day is merely a bull, but under the rays of the Moon canbecome or be something other. This balance between night and day is fundamental tohow we see the world and has little similarity with people out there that have taken thisterm sorgin, as their own.The idea of the sorgin holds so much more than the current witch beliefs oftenencountered today. A sorgin is born from need and necessity. We are born to carry a"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"burden that belongs to us all, but in order to carry it well we have also been given theknowledge of the necessary tools. This knowledge is not strictly about the pagan cycleof the year, nor is it about rites of worship of anything. We pay respect and reverence,sometimes out of love, but more often because of need and duty.All things have a name and when something is it is possessed by adur. Thephilosopher Andrés Ortiz-Osés makes a parallel between adur and eros and mana. Thisparallel can suffice to give an idea of what adur is. But it still cannot convey how asorgin perceives, understands and possesses adur. This difference can never be spoken,only experienced as it makes part of an arcane perspective of the world and our purposeas sorgin and belagile, people of the pact and the blood. Adur must always be followedby indar which is the ability to make use of adur, and this power is born from need, asecret fire that belongs to the sorgin.The Basque land held a particular interest for the Inquisition. When Pierre de Lancrecame to the Basque country to investigate the many cases of malefica for theinquisitorial tribunal he not only did this as a servant of God, but also to make peacewith his own ancestry. He found the Basque people to be ghoulish and strange,inconsistent and wicked in their ways of life and sexual lewdness. As his ancestors werecalling him back to his house so his awe and repulsion grew. In his notes we find ablend of the grotesque and beautiful slithering on a thin twig of faith and the blindnessonly faith can give.It so happened, for good and ill, that de Lancre gave the world some of the mostdetailed and shocking accounts of what he saw as witchcraft practices. He fused truthwith horror and diabolism of a Christian cast, and this has coloured the modern view ofwitchcraft which is seen as some form of paganism or polytheist heathenism and apeasant rebellion against the Church. This is, as I see it, a revision of history as we weredoing what we were used to doing until Christianity came and said we worshipped afigure called Satan, a figure they brought, as he was unknown to us until the people ofKixmi (Jesus Christ) came. I have nothing against Kixmi, and so we are not a rebellionagainst his people, but as I see it, they stole many of our secrets and they tried to makeus change the ways of our mothers. Is it so strange that we want to take back what isours?There are hundreds of examples in de Lancre's presentation that have a kernel oftruth, but they are constantly infested with his fascination with the Devil. Take forinstance the following paragraph:The Pythagoreans thought that when men were born, that is, men who were tobecome witches, a certain animal was born with them that they variously called abeast with several heads, discord, inconstancy, and mutability. Iamblichus calls ita beast with many heads, inconstant, and light. They no doubt meant the Devil."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"There is truth in this, because we are born with our ‘beast’ and our jauna (lord), andindeed this beast has many heads and forms, like the soul itself. But we can perhapsdisagree in his postulate that Iamblichus and Pythagoras saw in this the Devil ofKixmi's people.De Lancre called his treatise Portrait of the Inconstancy of the Witches, but Iquestion whether the inconsistency he read into the Basque ways were really his ownand those of a changing society, as Julio Caro Baroja suggested in his treatise about thewitches’ world. The sorgin is rather a stable element; he or she does not give in to thefancy of the world or change his or her clothes to make society comfortable. The sorginwalks the road of fate with tongs and hammer in their hands. And as the moon goesthrough her gardens and the sun through the signs of the horoscope so also does manand the world go through a cosmic rhythm and growth in order to remain true to itscore. The inconsistency is more with those that resist the natural flow of the world andwant the Sun to be the Moon and the Moon to be the Sun.The sorgin is a child of night and the secret fire that is veiled within the spirits ofnight and caves, he or she is the child of need, he or she is therefore someone thatconstantly keeps the chaotic powers in a state of peace. Hence, he or she is a mover onthe outskirts of the world. In saying this I do not intend to claim that the sorgin isengaging in some form of altruistic act; the stability of the world is merely aconsequence of the stabilising work with chaotic forces that in turn makes the sorginflow into the balance of Sun and Moon in harmonious ways. The Sun (Eguzki) and theMoon (Ilargi) are the two poles of the dynamic of all things. For us they are children ofMari, two daughters placed in the heavens to serve as Janicot's eyes, ensuring that Godsees all and watches over all as God of Day and God of Night.Ilargi is adur and Eguzki is indar and so it follows that all things breathe life anddeath in a constant dance of death and birth, and this is mirrored in Mari's first humanchildren, Atarabbi and Mikelats. The night is refuge and contemplation and the day isaction and accumulation. Their mother, Ama Mari is the animator of cosmos andcreation and brings all into being.Anthropologists constantly deem Mari to be a demoness who shows herself in red,white or black, depending on the degree of mercy or destructive power. Yet she is not ademoness, but is instead the merging of opposites, or rather their origin. Naturally, thesymbiosis of all there is will hold these oppositions as a unified globe of movementalternating destruction and becoming, because that is the very essence of being namedand being.From this arises the famous Akerbeltz, the Black Goat of the Sabbath, Mari's loverand son. The goat, as well as the bull, is a masculine symbol of fertility, strength andprotection. Mari loves the Bull and the Goat because of this power they hold to protectand bring forth progeny. The goat as the mediator of what moves between Ilargi andEguzki is deemed to possess all knowledge. He is equally demonised because of this"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"and seen to represent one who fails to understand that the spirits of night are not thespirits of the day.Hence, the akelarre, the celebration in the field of the goat, is a celebration of thepowers of adur, repose and contemplation. It is the Sabbath given by the spirit of dreamand also the Sabbath as danced out across the body of Mari. It is veneration, a livingsacrifice and a soothing of the worlds, a celebration of the eros that binds Ilargi toEguzki and brings ecstasy, joy and hope.The world under the light of the Moon as well as the Sun has many masters or lordsand of most importance are perhaps the Basajaun and Basandere, the Lord and Lady ofthe forest which are creative spirits and great protectors of the wildlife and greenwood.In a way it is these lords and ladies which ensure that we can still commune with thejaunak (lords) of the night and be on good terms with Ama Mari.The veneration of Mari is also replicated in the household. The house, and in particularthe kitchen where the fire of the house burns, is the domain of Mari and the lady of thehouse, the Etxekoandere, is a living manifestation of Mari in a particular point of natureset aflame by Mari's protective powers.Mari is said to live in caves, and several in the Pyrenees are said to be her dwelling:Zabalundi, Urkiola, Amezketa and orzoko amongst others. Some have found this to beinconsistent and confusing, but Mari is by her nature everywhere, so naturally a greatnumber of caves hold her presence. It is the same with her forms of manifestation: shecan be seen as a tree shooting forth flames, as a vulture, a bird-footed woman, as a horseor a goat, as a fire serpent, as a woman dripping fire or riding a pig or a ram, but mostoften she is a reddish woman holding a flaming sickle with snakes crawling beneath herfeet. Mari often take zoomorphic forms, because she is all there is, and these animalforms testify to her richness.Mari is said to have one husband (but multiple lovers), Sugaar or Maju, both beingsnakes, but of a different kind, though people usually make no distinction and see eitherof them as diabolic sugeak. Even those prone to the Christian superstition of good andevil often name Sugaar as Lord of the House and treat him with deserved respect,whether or not they see him as a devil. In token of this, it will serve the house well if anaxe is placed over the door with the blade facing upwards.Barandiarán tells in his Mitología Vasca that Mari condemns lying, theft, pride,boasting and the failure to keep one's word, disrespect of others and neglect of the needof others. We summarise these demands of Mari in the proverb: ezagaz eta baiabaz,which means with denial and with affirmation. There are several legends and storiestelling of how Mari manifests to sow destruction upon people who fail to keep hercommandments by allowing the person to fall foul of his own lies, pride or robbery. Tokeep one's word is considered extremely important; it is better not to promise than topromise and not be true to one's word."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The etxe (house) is a sanctuary and must be treated as such, because this too is whereMari dwells, in the cooking fire, where she infuses the Lady of the house with hercreative fires of renewal and destruction. The Etxekoandere is the guardian of thewoman and the tomb and this is what the hearth fire seals. All negotiations should bedone in the kitchen with Mari's fire burning, the Etxekoandere being heavily involved ineverything, this will bring Mari's attention to whatever business is being done. Anyhouse should be treated as the sanctuary of Mari, and how do we treat Mari'ssanctuaries?The rules for consulting Mari are as follows: When you find a cave where she residesyou must address her respectfully before entering and offer water, wine and milk at theentrance, stating why you have sought her out. You must state that you are coming toher with no deceit in your heart, lest she strike you down and make you one with AmaLur (the earth). You will then walk into the cave and bring to her milk, wine and water.When you leave the cave, you leave in the same way as you entered, meaning that if youentered walking forward you will leave walking backwards without turning around. Youare forbidden to sit down in her presence and should either stand or kneel in such waythat your buttocks are not touching the ground. You can than state the nature of yourvisit and wait for her response there or later in dreams.Mari is also the Queen of laminak, or lamias, usually seen as riverside sirens andnymphs that often fall in love with humans. This relationship can be good or baddepending on many vectors concerning the rules of the old ways of the land. We arehere confronted with a term which is not alien to us, as the lamia were popularised byromantic poets in the 18th and 19th centuries and depicted as vampiric seductresses.This does hold some truth, but as with so much, has been polluted and distorted by aflying fancy and a supercilious adoration of something that is other than what it seems.The laminak can kill you by draining you, by making you disappear or go mad, but theycan also open roads and gates to unfathomable riches and rewards; as long as love ispresent.Mari loves the thunder and the storm; hail is her punishment and fog is her grace.Especially dear to her are the storm spirits Odei and Itsai, which are the thunder and thelightning as found in the profundity of the cave's darkness. In this lies a great mysteryas profound as the deepest cave and Akerbeltz, the Black Goat is its vehicle and mouth.There is no worship in this, but reverence and communion, and this is what theinfamous akelarre is about. In Zugarramurdi we go to the Akelarren Lezea, the cave thatis at the meadow of the male goat but today it has been overtaken by people of a pagandisposition that drive the spirit of the cave deeper down, closer to the heart of the earth."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"DIABLO BASQUO ChildericoThe world under the Sun might be seen as pagan, but the world of Night belongs to thesorgin. Here we find the chaotic forces that threaten the pagan order and these forcesmust also be kept in their rhythm so chaos doesn't flood the world of the Sun. But let mereturn to the caves of Lezea. Martinez de Lezea in his collection of Basque legendsconcludes that the rituals of the witches had one common denominator: that they werebanned by the church. He also gives some ideas about the nature of the rituals that canbestow the witch powers upon a person. Amongst these he mentions circumambulatingthe church, rejecting baptism, and receiving a kuttuna which is usually translated asamulet, though it possesses a mystery far deeper than this. He also mentions that onecan kiss Etsai and make the sign of the cross with one's left foot and make the followingdeclaration: Por la se, zalpate, funte fa, funte fi, txiri, biri, ekatzu, ekatzu, amen, Sasiguztien gainetik, hodei guztien azpitik. In this or similar declarations one swears to beone with Etsai in some form or call upon Etsai to open a state between states. In thelatter charm which calls Etsai above the bramble and below the clouds it is used as akey for congress. Many of these riddles encoded in charm hold power both because ofthe intonation, and the reference they make through myth and legend which calls back"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"to the memory of the world.Etsai has many names like, Gaizkine (Malefic One), Yusuri (Scourge), Galtzagorri(Red pants), Kapagorri (Red Corporal/Captain), Txerren (Bad, Traitor) and many othernames, these being either epitaphs given to Etsai under the influence of the ChristianDevil who was syncretised with him, or names of other nocturnal spirits. The nameitself, Etsai, means enemy or opposer, and with the advent of Kixmi in the Basquecountry, this role was demonised, with Etsai and Satan seen as the same spiritual force,no doubt helped by the linguistic similarity.For us Etsai as the enemy is not understood in the same way as the Biblical Satan. Forus he is not a beautiful rebel angel, but the image of God reflected in the mandrake as itlights up the cave in memory and dreams. Etsai is old, almost as old as God – he is(t)his forgotten state, and naturally with the advancements and evolution of the world ofhumans he turned into an enemy; because he represents something forgotten, namelywisdom. He is also said to walk with spirits like Odei (spirit of night storms), Amets(spirit of dream) and Gaueko (the spirit of Night). By the same line of association Etsaiwas also seen as the dragon St. Michael held under his foot. This is an image we findcause to celebrate, but not in the ways Kixmi told his congregation! In many ways, Etsaican be seen as an adversary because he is one of the prime powers Mari uses to executepunishment upon those sworn to her that break their vow and code of honour. Themodazaharrak, or old ways of the land, are strict in their demands of truthfulness, ofkeeping one's word and avoiding lies and deception of any kind.Etsai can come out from his cave in Lezia or other caves where he dwells in the formof a snake, bull, horse or a pig. He is usually red, like his lover, Mari. When he comesout it is to watch over the world, to visit his children or to make love with Mari; andthus infuse all being with forgotten light. It was to Etsai that Mari gave her first humanchildren, Atarabbi and Mikelats, to teach them the wisdom of the world so humankindwould be wise and crafty.The way of the sorgin is about upholding the order of the world, the world under theMoon. Because of this we rarely speak words, as the rays of the Sun multiply in joywhat we say. Eguzki is wonderful and perfect, but we are not of her world, though she isof ours. Because of this we find our home, our etxe, in the embrace of Gaueko and Ilargiwhere the water of the moon serves as a constant reminder. We are not of this world,but the world is from the cave, the place of origin, the daybreak of the ages.Once in a while Mari comes to my cave with her laminak and the land grows moistwith fog and night dew. She takes my milk and wine and I go out from my cave to hearthe mighty heavenly snake Herensuge strike the earth voluptuously and I lose myself inlove and ecstasy. In this moment I turn into leaf, wood and dew as the night blazes red,red as the eyes of the bull watching the nightly renewal of the world and its mysteries.

I'd go as far as to saythat from one perspective the name ‘traditional witchcraft’ is something ofa misnomer as it can change, develop and evolve with great rapidity,reinventing its traditional roots which very frequently, although they certainly exist, arefrom traditions and groups that did not call themselves witches. Some strands of thetangled web of traditional witchcraft are undoubtedly lacking in any kind of tradition,and it is frequently these very people who affect to despise wiccans, despite the fact thatWicca has a proven lineage that goes back at least as far as the 1940s, something mosttraditional groups lack. More reputable and sensible groups and individuals are likely torespect Wicca and are content to differ. They will no doubt show both a great respectfor tradition as well as a refusal to be enslaved by it, after all there's little point incleaving to a tradition that lacks meaning or that needs to change in order to uncoverthat meaning. For instance, among the main transmitters of the ritual known as TheWaters of the Moon are the East Anglian Horsemen. It is certainly true that one canlearn a great deal by studying everything available about them, but in order to becomean effective toad-witch it is necessary to go beyond the bounds of their traditions, todelve into older, possibly more primitive influences, and to bring them into the presenttime without compromising the essential nature of the rite. The Horsemen were alsoentirely masculine, swearing never to divulge their secrets to a woman, but a study oftheir traditions is very useful to a woman who seeks to be a toad-witch. It is thatessential nature that we need to seek, not some dead traditional form which might domore to hide and stifle the essence than preserve it. Neither cleaving to mere form, norabandoning the spirit within the tradition, it is necessary to negotiate between theseextremes and arrive at one's own synthesis, a lifetime's work for anybody, regardless ofwhether or not they inherit a stream of traditional craft.In my own case I do have something of an inheritance, but mostly one ofresponsibility. I have frequently reiterated that Joe Wilson was far more concerned withtransmitting, to anybody capable of understanding, the essential method of 1734 ratherthan a ritual form. He asked that I should be one of three guardians of the 1734 stream,not strictly speaking in lineage from him, he was clear in his last days that there was nosuch lineage, but of the methods and basic principles that could be applied by anybodywilling to undergo that discipline and capable of grasping the method. This doesn'tmean that within 1734 there are no lineages, but their relevance and authority are self-contained by that lineage and have no relevance for others. So, if I establish such a"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"lineage it will no doubt be of benefit to those who inherit it, but there will be othersoutside of that lineage who will be just as much 1734 as my lineal spiritual descendants.The current essay is an attempt to chart the development, firstly of my own study andthen its development into the Clan of the Entangled Thicket alongside its founding andcurrent Maid, Jane Sparkes. I originally intended to write all of it, but found that Ineeded to incorporate lengthy quotations from Jane as well as rewrite many passages ather suggestion, so I have tried to allow her voice to come through in a slightlyunorthodox manner, neither quite as a full co-author nor merely as a quoted source. Ifeel that this allows a different perspective to communicate itself within this text thatmight be of value to somebody who is serious considering the study of the 1734method.During the time I have studied 1734 it is inevitable that my understanding of itshould change; although I can't take too much credit for that transformation as althoughI have striven to understand its many dimensions, and often worked very hard at this,much has been beyond my control or intent, an influx of information and inspirationfrom many sources, each transforming the possible understanding of 1734 andreflecting off each other. Some of these sources have been outside of 1734 itself, I mustmention here the inspiring and poetic work of Shani Oates, the Maid of the Clan ofTubal Cain as among the most important examples, and also John of Monmouth'spublication of many of the texts of Roy Bowers’ group under its various names andoffshoots, Thames Valley Coven, Royal Windsor Cuveen, The Regency and Clan ofTubal Cain. Both the Regency and the Clan fed into the 1734 stream, some ways arevery apparent, others less so. It is well known that Joe Wilson was the recipient of aseries of letters from Robert Cochrane that inspired many aspects of 1734, including itsname, but many seem to have ignored the contribution of The Regency and Ruth WynnOwen. In some ways this is understandable, Wynn Owen's group, Y Plant Bran,although it remains in existence, remains publically very quiet and comparatively littlecan be seen of it in that most public of realms, the internet. One may gather certainthings about it by looking at the website of an allied group Y Plant Dôn, but one shouldnot assume or presume too much by the common link between the two groups without adegree of inside knowledge, which, frankly, I lack. What we do know is that Ruth WynnOwen was a major influence on Joe, a fact that he acknowledged in his final version ofthe 1734 website.In the same website Joe discussed his first teacher, ‘Sean,’ who remained such ashadowy figure that it was possible to assume he might not have existed or that hemight be an amalgam of several people who had influenced Joe's early development.Any such ideas were thoroughly scotched when a cache of letters from Joe to ‘Sean’were sent to one of the Guardians of 1734, Aisling, by Sean's widow. It wasimmediately apparent that, far from being an imaginary figure or even one greatlyembellished on by time and memory, Joe had presented Sean in a very factual way, had"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"studied with him for several years and remained a close friend for several more, nearlyten years in total. Sean emerges as a fascinating and still enigmatic figure whoattempted to bring together the different aspects of his heritage, Scottish-Irish andNative American alongside local folk magics. It is also worth mentioning theappearance of a mass of notes, substantially written by Joe for an early 1734 group ThePantheon. This was preserved by Dave Finnin of The Roebuck and later broadcast byhim as a scanned document which he referred to, somewhat erroneously, as Joe's Bookof Shadows. None of the texts in this document mention Sean, neither do they directlymention Ruth, although they refer to, and briefly quote, her teachings.In his last years Joe Wilson had attempted to impart the essence of 1734 rather thanits form. He had always intended the form to be fluid, but had often found that manypeople were always happy to throw away the baby, but would hang on to the bathwaterwith grim determination. For example, where Joe had used Wiccan elements as a sort ofscaffolding for the more traditional material from his early teachers, some people seemto have done their best to ‘wiccanise’ 1734. Although it is important to recognise thatsome individuals and groups did indeed work in a valid manner, continuing to employthe Wiccan influence in the form of their workings, others bastardised it unforgivably,making the riddles and questions into a petrified dogma set in a neo-wiccan landscape,the very opposite of his intention. So, the question for Joe's last students was what was1734 when all that formal structure was stripped away? What was the essential methodand how could it be built into something that was closer to his central concerns at theend of his life? Joe spent a long time seeking the essence of shamanism and folk magic,not trying to take from other people's traditions, something which is often done withoutproper respect for the traditions, spirits and people from whom they are taken, butstarting with where one is. This begins with a simple relationship with sun and earth,nothing sentimental, just the recognition that without them we would not be here. Fromthat point one seeks a direct relationship with spirits and Spirit and in order to find thisone needs to set out in the open and wilder spaces, the paths, fields, woods.My own induction into 1734 seemed very different to this in that I was caught up inattempting to solve a series of mythopoetic riddles and puzzles. Of course, as I wastrying to absorb the lessons of Metista and Toteg Tribe my rather intellectual and poeticstrivings had a very different context to mere mental acrobatics. There is certainlyintellectual effort involved, but that is something like a launch-pad for a more informedintuitive approach, a holistic approach one might say, in which intellect and intuitionare brought into balance. Some people have understandably made the mistake ofsupposing that 1734 is based on Graves’ The White Goddess. This is not the case, butthe initial tests often are, drawn more immediately from the so-called Robert CochraneLetters. Cochrane's own tradition the Clan of Tubal Cain is, in turn, not based onGraves, but, although it sometimes leans on his work for support, its origins andmeanings are quite distinct. So, the Cochrane method uses his work as a series of"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"examples and explorations of possibilities, it is a poetic method rather than the contentthat is at stake. Without the poetic method all is dully literal; rather we need to learn atwilight language.It is fair to say that the method is also used as a way of helping people to developdiscrimination between enchanting ideas and the often gritty truth. It is in this frictionthat we can best develop real poetic insight. So it was only gradually that I was able toreally develop a praxis that started to respond to my own understanding of 1734’sessence, and then only when I started to work regularly and cohesively with Jane whowas to become the Maid of our tiny clan. We increasingly abandoned anything thatbelonged to Wicca or to Druidism (an important part of Jane's background) andattempted to identify the principles of each working so that we could workspontaneously around those principles. We sometimes made mistakes and sometimesfound that the mistakes worked better than the way we had considered correct. Weworked mostly in the garden, a lovely and secluded spot, but were increasingly drawn tothe nearby woods. Traditional elements sometimes emerged within our freeform praxis,for instance, I had, some years previously, found a single antler tine that I had used as awand or pointing tool. I then found out that there were several in the BoscastleWitchcraft Museum. They had originally been used in sail-making and because of thisconnection with harnessing the wind were subsequently used in weather magic. The tinetherefore seemed very appropriate to use in summoning the Wind Gods. This idea cameto me only gradually, as my notion of who and what the Wind Gods are wastransformed by practice and meditation. Although they do relate to the elements, theyare not primarily elemental guardians, but the Winds, and it is their force that drives usaround the Mill towards the realm of the Queens or the Rose Castle. Therefore theybecome essential to our practical, as well as philosophical understanding of the Mythos.At this point I would like to quote extensively from Jane's notes to give a differentperspective: DOORWAY TO THE MYSTERIES · Jane Sparkes lthough Stuart's entry point was through the magic of the riddle, such thingsdid not grab my attention in quite the same way. My way through was via adifferent gate. At first, I had spent a lot of time and energy trying to prove thatRobert Graves’ obsession with the tree alphabet was really only practical fromhis personal standpoint, as someone who spent a lot of his time away from these shores.As I have a long-standing personal relationship with the trees he examines, it made medig even deeper to prove he was mistaken in some cases.

And as Joe Wilson said, experience isthe only real teacher; and I seek that experience, not in my case through the solving ofriddles, although that is still a valid gateway, but it is not one that all may find.Personally I have found that: the answers to all things are in the Air-Inspiration, andthe Winds will bring you news and knowledge if you ask them properly. The Trees of theWood will give you power, and the waters of the Sea will give you patience andomniscience, since the sea is the womb that contains a memory of all things. (RobertCochrane) (Amen and amen again, I say to those words. JS)Once we began to work the woods there were various places that seemed eithernatural ‘hot spots’ or symbolically relevant to us. For instance, there was a beautiful oldtree with a hollow trunk that looked like a table, so we started to make offerings there.We had already used the little river that flowed nearby for various workings; we nowlooked at various sites in a more complex way, identifying mythic factors, crossing thelittle bridges on the river, walking the paths that ran by the cemetery. Eventually weidentified a crossroads that seemed just perfect. It aligned with the cardinal points andjust slightly North-East there is an oak.When we attended the Scarlet Imprint ‘Summer of Love’ event in the Summer of2011 we were struck by Jake Stratton-Kent's talk, not only for its intrinsic interest, buthow he described a magical landscape that in many ways, including some small details,related to the mythic landscape that we had built up and worked with in the Clan of theEntangled Thicket. What Stratton-Kent was talking about was something very differenteither from regular temple-based ritual magic or from neo-paganism. He seemed to bedescribing a magic that was earthy, but not earth-bound, sensual, understanding that theOtherworld and our world might overlap or even be the same, from a very differentperspective. What we are discussing here links to Stratton-Kent's talk only tangentially,but in a way that it might open doors for a few people. I shall discuss both the ritual ormythic landscape and the connections between Joe Wilson's late expression of 1734 andthe Afro-American tradition Hoodoo. The two meet, wouldn't you know it, at theCrossroads. ROOT AND BONE: FOLK MAGICS ow I want to back-track a little. In the last two years of his life Joe Wilson hadbecome increasingly interested in Hoodoo. There were several reasons for this.Firstly, his last wife (there were several) Cher, was an African-Americanwoman who practiced Hoodoo. Secondly, he said that although it was not thesame, it was similar in many respects to the sort of folk-magic he had learned as a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"young man. Thirdly, he had enrolled as a student on his friend Cat Yronwode's Hoodoocourse and he was recommending it to his own students.I was a bit surprised when Joe seemed rather insistent that I should learn Hoodoo;after all, I was not only white, but British, what sort of connection would I have with anAfrican-American tradition? Although Joe had founded 1734 in the 1970s he had gonethrough a long phase of disenchantment with the way 1734 developed and a fascinationwith American Indian practices. To some extent this was a filtering through ofinfluences from his first teacher, Sean. Sean had been of mixed ancestry, part Celtic,Irish and Scottish and part Amerindian. He spent much of his time with the local Indiantribes and the influence was strongly felt in his teachings. Perhaps Joe was trying toreach back into this aspect of his mentor's work, but seems to have gone overboard for awhile and studied with controversial Indian teachers such as Sun Bear. I think it isreasonable to say that Joe was to feel a sense of remorse later and when he set upMetista the focus was on not taking from the practices of other cultures withoutpermission and without cultural context, but finding within one's own inner and culturalresources the essential nature of one's own spirituality. Joe spoke scathingly of thoseforms of cultural appropriation all too often found in new-age groups and books thatwere too often merely theft and frequently led to eclectic mishmashes that lacked anykind of integrity. Although Joe came to espouse a kind of shamanistic practice, he verydeliberately distanced his version from new-age neo-shamanism as well as the so-calledcore shamanism of Michael Harner. For him the problem with Harner's work was that ittook tribal practices from very different, usually Amerindian, peoples, and put themtogether regardless of cultural context. Therefore the degree to which they might meshtogether mythically was limited and thus so was their potency. And what spirits mightcome, summoned by people not their own, not having the connection to the land or thepeople and spirits of that practice?Metista, and later on Toteg Tribe, were in large part an attempt to develop not only acommunity of people who based their spirituality on their own internal and culturalresources, but one in which they could consequently access the inner realms on theseterms and without taking from exotic traditions. Now, given this, why on earth was Joesuggesting I should study Hoodoo? On the face of it, Joe's enthusiasm for Hoodoo mighthave seemed contradictory, but I think there were good reasons for it. Firstly, as I havesaid, Hoodoo has many similarities to the kind of folk magic Joe learned in his youth.Secondly, as it is not usually an initiatic tradition, it is, as it were, an open source inmany ways. Beyond this, it is important to realise that as a syncretic system, Hoodoohas never been purely African American, having many traces of European and NativeAmerican influence and indeed, historically, there have been White practitioners ofHoodoo for a considerable time. So, for the American members of Metista and TotegTribe Hoodoo constituted a living tradition of herbal and folk magic that could be"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"learned and practised with at least some sense of harmony with their dominant culture,although the very history of Hoodoo reveals a degree of antagonism as well and I willdiscuss this a bit later.My early experience of Hoodoo felt both very limited and rather abstract. I couldread a certain amount, but had few supplies and had little idea where I could find more.I heard rumours of two botanicas in Brixton, but nobody seemed able to tell me quitewhere they were. Some Hoodoo ingredients were easy to find as they were common orgarden herbs and oils, others seemed extremely exotic. Somebody finally showed mewhere the Brixton shops were (actually only a few doors away from each other) andthen something changed my view and my experience completely: I actually met arootworker living in London.Dr Beetle was a young African-American woman who had grown up in New York,then lived some time in the South before marrying an Englishman and moving toLondon. She had been taught Hoodoo by her Godmother who lived in Brooklyn, but hadoriginally come from South Carolina and was of the Gullah people. What was initially arather cautious friendship became, over a period of time, something like an informalapprenticeship. I don't want to over-emphasise this, but there was a gradual building oftrust and then sharing of information and then, rather unexpectedly demands were madeof me, that I should help with some piece of work or should read certain books. Thesebooks were usually not the rash of new and popular works on Hoodoo practice, usuallyrather shallow and frequently ‘Llewellynised,’ but mostly historical works, for exampleYvonne Chireau's Black Magic, an account of the origins of Hoodoo through slaveryand oppression. It became obvious that Hoodoo is not the rather pleasant new-ageherbal magic portrayed in Stephanie Rose Bird's Sticks, Stones, Roots and Bones, but aweapon, the only weapon of the unarmed and helpless, in a war fought over centuries.To be more precise, it is many things, but if you ignore this aspect of Hoodoo, its use todominate, jinx, hex or curse, you deliver an emasculated version of it that is reduced tothe same new-age eclectic mess that every other magical system seems to end up as.This is not to say that every Hoodoo spends all their time cursing their enemies andattempting to dominate everybody around them, but because these are real and livingissues in communities that practice folk magic, you really need to know about them ifyou are going to be effective in counteracting dark workings. For instance, if somebodyhas been working on a person, undermining their confidence, drawing them closer totheir own inner darkness, will they really feel much confidence in someone who justdraws a few pentagrams in the air? Even at a purely psychological level the work wouldseem to need to be more physical, more embodied, where the practitioner might dosomething for their client but also give them something to do that will enforce thepsychological message. Baths, washes, powders, all have an element of physicality thatgives the magic a sense of reality. When Dr Beetle asked me to help her in a houseclearing we visited her clients to find them living in wretched circumstances. They"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"believed that they had been hexed by the grandmother, apparently well known in hercommunity for working negative Obeah. Even if they had not been worked at they werevery definitely stuck in their situation and were reinforcing it themselves. We made aspirit bottle for them to trap and eliminate negative forces. It contained layers of gooferdust, glitter, pins, roots and other materials making something designed to counteractwhatever worked against them. In a short while their situation changed for the better.While they had been utterly stuck in their grim flat in an even grimmer estate, theirlives gradually shrinking around them, they found ways out, new accommodation, relieffrom their negative personal situations and renewed strength to deal with theirdifficulties. The difference manifested throughout their lives, physical, emotional andpsychological. I think that what was important here was that the work was tailored tosuit the needs of the clients; it was not a one size fits all approach, and I am sure this isa major reason why it worked.More recently we came to know another rootworker living in London, Miss D. Shewas rather different, specialising in love and lust work, her background was not AfricanAmerican, but neither was it very English. Born in the Philippines, she had beenadopted by a British couple, but had led a sometimes itinerant childhood and her motherhad picked up elements of Hoodoo tradition on her own travels and transmitted them toher daughter. D. had then started to study on her own and while not having the samebasis in tradition that Dr Beetle had, she was able to use what she knew very effectively.At Lammastide that year Jane and I invited her to join us in our seasonal working and itwas happy and successful enough occasion that we then decided to do a collectiveworking in a crossroads in the woods. In fact, our working was oddly eclectic; we wereall going there to do something of our own, but together. Miss D. needed to go to theCrossroads to work with St Expedite and carried a statue of him to the crossroads. Janeneeded to call on Hekate and I wanted to work with one of the spirits of the Toad BoneRite. Normally I do not like this sort of eclectic approach, as it tends to confuse things.Each working was valid in itself, but didn't necessarily mix or fuse with the others, so itcould have all fallen flat. Nevertheless, it was a night we still frequently talk about, itfelt like a real night of power.I want to change tack at this point. So far it has been mostly a narrative; now I wouldlike to examine more closely some of the issues that seem relevant to this curiousrelationship between 1734 and Hoodoo. It is not, as you must have realised by now,straightforward, but while I never wish to avoid complexity or brush problems under thecarpet, I don't think we need to be overwhelmed by these problems, far from it. Thissort of complexity, addressed with a certain straightforwardness, does not resolve intomere simplicity, but it is something that becomes very direct and real and fantasticallyrich. So the remainder of this essay will break into brief sections, each addressing someof these issues on their own ground. Some are comparisons, finding of common ground,some are tensions or problems; all are a part of the fabric of my own branch of 1734, for"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"better or worse. (For me, the important part is to be able to examine things in a differentway, and which gives me a clearer view of what I have and hold. JS) THE FAMILY, THE ANCESTORS AND THE HIDDEN COMPANY t is worth mentioning that the Ancestors play an important part, both inHoodoo and in all of Joe Wilson's work, not just 1734, but Metista and TotegTribe as well. One should not really speak, as many do, of ancestor worship butcertainly of respect, of veneration and of contacting and working with them indifferent ways. Certainly the Ancestors are central to traditional Hoodoo as indeed tomost folk magical systems and it is they who give the magic their power, so this wouldseem to be an area we need to examine in more detail.According to Joe, we can break the Ancestors down into three fundamentalcategories: firstly biological ancestors. Most cultures have a great deal of regard for thepeople of their own bloodline, they are literally our family and are often those mostlikely to help and support us, protect us from negative works and harm. But at the sametime they are still who they once were, even if they are wiser and more powerful. Also,it has to be acknowledged that not all ancestors are benign and many might baulk atworkings of magic and witchcraft.The second, almost equally important category, is that of spiritual ancestors. We needto consider our late teachers and their teachers, even if they do not constitute a formallineage. It was an important experience for me to learn something about Joe's firstteacher ‘Sean.’ When Joe had spoken of him I didn't actually have any evidence that hereally existed. Joe spoke of him as if he did, but he remained shadowy and unreal to me.Imagine my delight to find that Joe's account of Sean had in fact been very factual anddirect, apparently not romanticised or fictionalised at all. I certainly could not claimSean as official lineage, but he was my teacher's teacher and the revelation of him to meseemed to make a sense of contact with him a reality. At the very least he gets thatmoment of veneration when I pay homage to my ancestors. In the realm of spirit, andmost especially where there is no bloodline involved, the notion of spiritual adoption isof paramount importance. Within many forms of Traditional Craft one is not simplyinducted into a group, rather one is adopted into a family. This is an important reasonwhy we speak of clans rather than covens. By this act the initiate can, with right effort,find access to the ancestral and tutelary spirits of the stream. Within this scheme theancestors especially, but also the tutelary spirits, relate to the egregore of the clan.Within the wider scope of the stream we might find a great degree of variation here.Obviously some of the ancestral spirits will be particular to the individual, their ownancestors and the spirits with whom they forge bonds or make pacts. Others form, indifferent ways, some kind of lineage. In 1734 there is no lineage as such, although thedifferent clans and covens within the broader 1734 family do have lineages. But 1734,as a method, allows direct access and development of one's own relationships with"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"ancestral and tutelary spirits and it is difficult to make any definitive claim as to howthis might be expressed in any group or individual.So, all 1734 groups derive, directly or indirectly, from Joe and his teachings. Joe isalways therefore in ancestral relationship to 1734 as its founder. Some might haveinherited particular ancestors and guardians from working with Joe, others might haveforged relationship with quite other spirits. Everybody will have ancestral spirits oftheir own, even if they were adopted. The ancestors are always with us. In my own caseI have my own mix of biological and spiritual ancestors, human spirits who seem to bein some kind of relation to me, and various other, possibly non-human spirits, such asthe genius loci and the patron spirits of the Toad-bone rite. A GATHERING OF LIGHT AND SHADOW Tutelary Spirits and the Genius Lociypically, many spirits that one might encounter in various ways might beconsidered non-human. While the ancestral spirits, in the context I havediscussed them in, are specifically our human ancestors, by blood or adoption,many others are of a different order of being. Among the more important onesare the genius loci, the spirits of place. As our work developed, we became increasinglyaware that we needed to form relationships with, and not just placate, the spirits thatinhabit both the physical and the mythical landscapes in which we practice. While somemight be more or less generic, they are mostly particular to the locality, which is, afterall, why they are spirits of place. This stream, this tree, this clearing, field, pond. Somewould appear to be more transitory, moving as animals do, maybe are indeed animals,actual or not, others seem rooted to the spot. We started to make regular offerings,mostly of cake or bread and wine, sometimes other edibles, also smoke, perfume,brandy, whiskey or rum, even water. We also quickly took up the practice of leavingcoins as offerings at certain places. (These spirits can become helpers even when notperforming a working. On an individual basis, my primary connection is with the spiritsthat reside in a particular place. These spirits can also lead you on a dance and get youlost, the lapwing dance is always present! JS)If I think of the various guardian spirits of which I am aware, the first is Mortimer, anancestor doll made for me by Joe Wilson. Mortimer seems to have something of Joe'scharacter and curiously winning ways, in his origins he might have been thought of as aservitor, but he seems to be far more than that, very much his own person, but never ahuman being. He travels freely between the realms. He is a go-between, almost apsychopomp, and can help forge relations with the spirits of place. They, in turn, can beeither well defined or vague, according to our experience of that place. Some can bemore or less synonymous with the spot they are spirits of, effectively are that tree orwhatever, while others can have a wider sphere of activity. An American colleague"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"recently discussed the question of a tradition rooted in British myth approaching theindigenous spirits of the Americas. It seemed evident to me that an indigenous spirit ofplace would not be ‘Indian’ or First Nation but would precede the Indian tribes, possiblyby millions of years – to some degree depending on the nature of the place. While wewould all experience these genius loci through our own cultural filters, in themselvesthey would no more be Indian than Celtic or Saxon or African.On the other hand, the spirits that belong to a stream of Craft will, in different ways,be profoundly shaped by our culture, but then it is necessary to consider both what thatculture is and how they might depart from our expectations. Too many depictions in thepagan and occult communities have gods and spirits wafting around in ‘timeless’ gownsor looking like refugees from a heavy metal album cover. But would, say, Tettens,really look like Gandalf, or would he look quite other? To some extent their appearanceis dictated by how we visualise them, but as they develop a sense of reality for us, thesebeings, gods and spirits alike, move into a more reciprocal relationship and shape ourperception of them. For the group it is important to agree upon the appearance of thesebeings. This was hammered home for us when we read John of Monmouth's GenuineWitchcraft Explained, where Roy Bowers expresses his frustration at the group'sinability to arrive at this agreement and imposes a form for their ‘Hermes.’ Thisagreement allows the proper development of the egregore, the group mind. THE MYTHOS ur perception of the gods and spirits rests to a great degree on ourunderstanding of the clan mythos. A bare outline of the mythos is includedin the document The Basic Structure of the Craft, but it would be a mistaketo suppose that this is the entirety of the mythos or that we do not deviatefrom it. As is so often the case, I cannot speak for other branches of 1734, but ourstarting point was that document and from it we elaborated a great deal more at variouslevels. At this point it is useful to mention the publication of a work by Shani Oates,The People of Goda, which gives an unprecedented insight into the mythos of the Clanof Tubal Cain. This has been extremely useful for us, not only in seeing how weresemble a related tradition, but how we depart from it. The simplest explanation mightbe that we understand our mythos as a whole to consist of many levels of related mythiccycles. This is necessarily open-ended, the mythos is not static, but rather a growingthing, dependent on our current understanding. It is not the same as it was a few yearsback and in a few more years it will have transformed again. Within this one mightdiscern a ‘pagan’ level, almost in the currently understood usage of the term, but also amore Christian level, albeit one that most Christians would probably not recognise. Onemight speak of Hermetic or alchemical levels and also of both Luciferian and Cainiteunderstandings, especially in relation to the rite known as The Waters of the Moon – theToad-bone Rite."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"So, if we consider the yearly cycle and the relation between the Horn Child and theLord of the Mound, the battle of the Twins, we also consider how they might relate tothe way we experience the Goddess, as Rose Queen, or Pale Faced Goddess, as Hekateor Lilith. We find a path that takes us across the River and through the Wasteland andfinally to the Rose Castle. This much is established, but for each person the path isdifferent and has many byways unique to each of us. On the one hand this means Iwould not wish to over-define the mythos in a dogmatic way, because the outline mayremain constant, but it will be different for you than for me. It is also essential to ourway of working that while the realisation of the mythos awaits the discovery of thelandscape that can accommodate it, the mythos is also in some ways shaped by thelandscape, at the very least in as much as it plays a fugue on the mythic components aswe discover them played out within the actual land. The myth takes on flesh, realencounters and imaginary merge and change places. Clearly this is an evolving workand much would change if there was a permanent change of location, but the clan workis also a moveable feast, elements of the mythos would change and others remain, butas ours is very much an evolving work, much will change as we grow in understanding. THE MYTHIC LANDSCAPE e have already referred to the notion of a mythic or ritual landscape in whichthe ritual forms of the working are played out. The actual land becomes thefocus for different kinds of working and different forms of the compass. Butmore than that, the land becomes hallowed through working with it and newrelationships, between the practitioner and the land, and its spirits, develops. While wehave a compass area within a secluded garden, in which we can work and feast andelaborate the mythic landscape in miniature – an important aspect of the geography ofthe compass – by entering the woods, even though they are very managed and heavilypopulated by joggers and dog-walkers in the day time, at night the woods aretransformed. We can wander from place to place, use particular trees that are relevant toour mythos, oak and holly among others, features of the wood, the clearings, a bridge, acrossroads and a place that signifies the Castle. By pacing this landscape we are notonly walking in this world, a suburban wood, but also the Otherworld, the groundbecomes sanctified, or perhaps its sanctity becomes recognised. It reveals a differentaspect of reality, the process involves the body and the mind, emotion and sensationtogether. At one of the key points we find a crossroads and slightly to the north-east anoak. This has become one of the key places of how our mythology plays out for us, notas a single sacred tale, but as an interplay of real and imaginary and a naturalintersection between the worlds. We need to emphasise, however, that we are notworking in just three dimensions, but several more in that there are many levels andworlds and different modes of access according to the kind of working."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" COMPASS AND STANG Chariot and Horse?he stang is probably the most familiar symbol of Traditional Witchcraft andhas been known to be adopted within Wiccan and neo-pagan circles. It hasusually been described as representing ‘the god’ and this is true as far as itgoes, but like a lot of things in Traditional Witchcraft, only as far as it goes,and in fact it goes a lot further than that. Recent publications have shown how the stanghas various other names, including the Horse which suggests that it might be regardedas a vehicle, and indeed there are engravings of the 15th and 16th centuries that showwitches on forked poles, much as they are shown on broomsticks in popularillustrations. I would suggest that it must, like many things in traditional craft, revealitself as polysemic which is to say that it contains many meanings which cannot beexhausted by any single description, and if this is true of the stang it is even more trueof the Compass.While I have heard of people describing the compass as what traditional witches callthe circle, it is in fact something quite different; or rather its meanings are far fromexhausted by such a description, it is many other things besides. In particular thecompass can be understood as the map of the other worlds, as the territory of thoseworlds and as the vehicle by which on can travel the worlds. It can be a circle, a squareor a crossroads, Cain's blood-acre or the Castle of the Rose Queen and much besides. Atthe most generic level we are speaking here of sacred space, but it is not just that it isdeclared special and sacer (Latin: apart) but it embodies a flexible symbolism thatcharges it with meaning. Actual symbols might be used in various combinations as akind of memory theatre, mnemonic devices for triggering associations, this, of course,is common to many kinds of temple work, although here the symbols can be both man-made and natural and to a great extent include the nature of the location. For instance,Evan John Jones refers to several different kinds of location used in the rites of the Clanof Tubal Cain, a hill, a cave, an abandoned chapel and so on. In The Waters of the Moonone keeps vigil in a graveyard, some rites are held in woods by certain kinds of trees.Apart from the actual location the nature of the rite is announced by the tools used ineach case. The stang is most commonly positioned in the North, but in her bookTubelo's Green Fire, Shani Oates reproduces diagrams showing it in the centre and inthe South of the compass. In our own workings we move the stang for some of theseasonal festivals, so for the cross-quarter festivals it remains in the North, while forthe equinoxes and solstices it travels round the compass through the year. So it can beseen that the stang can provide different foci within the compass according to purpose,but it would seem to do far more than that, and it is only one of several tools that wecommonly employ.If somebody was so inclined they could create an experiment quite easily, either bybringing together a collection of tools or by making a set of cards of those tools and"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"moving them around the compass in different combinations. If cards are used this canbe done in miniature and this is indeed a very valuable exercise, although no substitutefor getting out and working with this idea in the flesh as it were. Start by consideringthe directions in the Traditional compass. Although we use the names of the Wind Godsas given in the Basic Structure of the Craft document we see them as fundamentallyforces, potencies, rather than statically as personifications, or rather they are both.Although they do also embody the elements, they are not primarily elemental guardians,but Lords of the Winds and much can be learned if you consider just how many windsthere might be. Nevertheless, they do also embody the elements as a part of theirfunction, Lucet for Fire, Carenos for Earth, Node for Water and Tettens for Air. So onepossibility is what happens if you put a symbol for water in the fire quarter? Thisquestion is true in any symbolic system that employs elemental correspondences. If youput water with water, clearly there is a harmony, if fire with water there is a tension orfriction, or maybe just steam! Consider though how, in the Golden Dawn they employedcomplex combinations of the Tattwas in order to explore and work with differentaspects of the elements. It is possible to do this with the tools of the Traditional Craft,albeit in a possibly more homespun manner.So, if by positioning tools along the compass one can portray shifts in the seasons ordevelop combinations of elemental power, this still only seems to give the compass twodimensions; it has far more than that. It is said that the Compass is the map of theOtherworld, the Otherworld itself and the vehicle by which it is traversed. Put simply itis not just the flat circle on the ground (actual or imagined) or indeed a sphere, althoughthis too could be a part of what one works with, but it also has height and depth so thatone can enter the Underworld or attain the Upper Worlds through different ways ofworking. The symbols are laid out in a way appropriate for the world one wishes toexplore; the necessary inner work is done so that one can enter. This is where the Stanghelps to mark out the territory in a quite different way. We know that other names forthe Stang are the Horse and the Tree. Again we find that a symbol is open enough to beboth the territory and the vehicle that takes one to that world. One of the importantaspects of Cochranian Craft that has become publicly known is the correlation betweenthe Stang and the mysterious diagram known as the Mask. That there should be somepoint of identity should not be a great surprise, but the degree of detail andsophistication in this system is considerable. Again I point to Shani Oates’ bookTubelo's Green Fire, where she makes it very clear that Cochrane was thinking in termsof analogies with Qabala and the Tree of Life. It should certainly not be thought of asidentical or simply rebranded, but as an analogous system in which one can ascend theworlds through the Stang's symbolism.Imagine then a mobile and flexible symbolism in which the static magic circle isreplaced by something like a kaleidoscope whose meaning is determined by the positionof the relatively fixed items used in the working. For example, in a more or less"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"impromptu working some months ago, we used among other things a fox skull, deerantler and toad bones marking out the compass. We could have easily used otherobjects, depending on what we had found or what we carried with us. Also, it is morevariable than this as you might arrive at a different symbolism to us, through differentcircumstances and different promptings of Spirit or the spirits. VALE: TWILIGHT TONGUE he symbols of our craft reveal many different meanings, according to need,season and our own predilections. While we might be firm in the observanceof a principle: We have no hard and fast dogma that we adhere to, what we dohold fast to is change itself, carried along by the winds, and if we fall we arisestronger. We embrace our heritage, found in the hills, woods, forests and streams of thisland. It cries out from the very roots of the plant that live here, and blossoms forth intheir flowers, and laps over our feet as we stand on the shores of the sea. They are myteachers, and I listen to their voice. (JS)I spoke earlier of the Twilight Language of the Tantras, also known as IntentionalLanguage. It would seem to be of two forms. The one is the inner meaning of thesymbolism of the tantras, something that might be common to all to whom it isimparted. The other is whispered by the dakinis, especially in liminal states ofmeditation, dream and trance. While there are obvious differences between our Craftand the tantric traditions, I insist that at this point there is a similarity. The poeticallyunderstood symbolism of the Letters and the Basic Structure of the Craft, once broughttogether with the art of listening to the winds, the trees and the waters, and to the voiceof Spirit, constitutes our Twilight Tongue, heard imperfectly now, but ever moreclearly.This also has some bearing on our final point; Jane asked a question in her notes: Sowhere does that leave us as a group? And she began to answer: This is the never-endingquest for answers that fires our clan engine, and drives us ever onward. It means thatnothing is fixed, all can change. However it has also become clear that for clanworkings we need to develop the egregore, the group mind. So although we might havedifferent interests, influences and leanings, when we work together we pull together, soour focus becomes complete agreement on the working we will undertake, and the shapeof the images called to mind.The egregore is fundamental to much of occult work, but sometimes seems to getoverlooked. In our case we were strongly aware of it, but it remained a bit nebulousuntil we read Genuine Witchcraft Explained and saw just how we had avoidedsomething fundamental and obvious. But however obvious the egregore might be on onelevel, it can't be taken for granted.

Laws may be broken but to break with human convention is a sin,to pursue this quarry is to willingly cast yourself away from acceptable society andplaces you in the company of others who would also attempt to touch the gods.Confused beings stumble upon these crooked paths, would-be guides and mentors seekto add to this confusion, as there is power in keeping the dispossessed in this bemusedstate. Many follow these leaders, content in the knowledge that they finally belong tosomething; occasionally glimpsing the other and assuming the words of fools are thetruth. It is a heresy of sorts to question your guide and yet I have questioned all andhave found myself an exile even in this strange land.For many years the questions persisted, close to answers sometimes, yet further fromthe truth in others, the ego still in control and the true self a subdued being fighting forair beneath a sea of discontent. A searching, fuelled by anger and the need to fit insomewhere. A feeling that I could not be a man alone on this path or I would likely failin this quest for the grail. To fall here would render my existence pointless, my acquiredknowledge worthless and my life's work a waste of a life.Then I fell.This fall was no slow descent into the realm of madness, I was in free-fall down a wellof utter despair. My ego clasped at the sides of the well as I fell, desperate to find a holdyet the walls were smooth and steep, the light disappearing from view. Added to by thepain of failure, this inability to hold all that I was together, this was a self-destructioncreated by a noisy ego, my own fault and divine justice, and stinging tears burnt the skinupon my face. That was that day I died for the first time. None saw the corpse, yet manycould observe the gaping cracks that appeared in my personality. The corpse was"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"hidden, like the knowledge I sought to embrace, this man was broken and there werenone who could repair him.All things must die; this is a divine truth that is universally recognised and thiscreature that we call the ego is no exception to this rule. For a new beginning there mustbe an end. I see this now, though at that time the helpless cries of this dying monster ofmy own making blocked out the sound. My dearest and most beloved heard the cry andyet there was no tear shed for this passing, as she knew in herself the seed of creationwas starting to stir.There I stood at the crossroads once more, many possible paths spread out before me.Behind I perceived a wasteland, a past that no longer belonged to this lone figure at themeeting and parting of ways, a choice to be made that in all truth was no choice at all,for amongst the destruction there were gems which I had carried for many a year,beneath the dust they still shone, that sense of the other, those connections to the greaterwhole, those very jewels that the greater population considered to be the signs ofmadness, or at best the products of a deluded mind. I know that I hung on a windy tree Nine long nights, wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin, myself to myself, on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run. No bread did they give me nor a drink from a horn downwards I peered; I took up the runes, screaming I took them, then I fell back from there.(From the Hávamál)With what I now held in my hands, the journey of the fool began as I set forth upon thepath that few choose to walk with absolute honesty. To separate the lies from the truth Ihad to re-examine all that I had, the tools of the Craft, the learned words of others, thetrappings of life and love. The books I had acquired over many years had little meaningnow, the wisdom of so many reduced to pulp, much of which was fit for the fires ofneed and little else. Yet there was inspiration within the piles of dead trees, two men,whose words still rang true even here in this dark place, lost voices that still did beckonin the wilderness that was my soul. I owe my debt to Roy Bowers and Evan John Jones,calm voices within a storm of noise, men whom one could see were truly inspired byShe who would show us the light, searching souls who gave all of themselves and tookonly what they were given. They were the foundation for this would-be cunning man to"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"build upon anew, and that is exactly what I did.It is need and not desire that drives the human condition. Desire leads us back to Egoand to return to that path is to deny one's own evolution. To stand within the compassand to assume to know all that these realms have to offer is heresy at best. A far simpleranswer is to be a child, a blank slate, one who is prepared to listen to that knowledgethat flies upon the wind, then and only then will She open her arms and gather you homeagain. Upon the rough twisted edge of the abyss I stand. Dawn breaks the change of man. Beyond the reach of the beloved and upon the wings of destiny, we Fly. Head long, straight into the arms of Fate. To stand upon that distant land, To knock upon the castle doors. Many rivers to cross, many mountains to climb. A road less travelled to a destination rarely seen. That blessed isle, that perilous realm.  Pray be with me now, for this holy fool does stand or fall at your will. An infant soul, to the arms of his mother goes. I would beg you now to be kind, to hold me in your love, not brush me aside as autumn leaves to the wind, Ash to this storm. I am the clay to be shaped, the sword in the stone. Mould me, temper me. I am yours.No compass was marked upon the soil just my simple stang and a pile of tools that hadno meaning, the quarters were realms to be explored, to listen and look and see what Ifound there.

From the fire of need the rose did grow and bloom.Yet I was alone, if Fate herself had decreed this was to be, who was I to argue withher plan? Perhaps as the solitary man I would have to serve, yet I yearned forcompanionship within those dark nights of ritual, to celebrate in the company of others,but desire will always lead you back to delusion, so I left that one in her hands andconcentrated on the work at hand. The call went out, green fire to light the sky of anywho had the eyes to see.This wind of change blew away that which I had thought I had in common with thegeneral pagan community of our isle, many of whom had stopped looking forward,content in their own little worlds, becoming as indoctrinated as the followers of themodern church and as inspired by the same vices as popes, cardinals and bishops hadbeen before. Witchcraft was for sale on huge commercial levels; a taste of the lie for thesake of a coin, and I was not prepared to buy. Wisdom was free for those with an openheart and an open mind. My own place was not among the sheep and I had no wish tobecome the shepherd either, the path of the hermit would suit just fine until the timewhen, and if, the Gods would bless this one with a true Family.Traditional Craft in the sense of working groups/clans/families is not open to all, itspractitioners come from many walks of life and anonymity serves to protect thoseindividuals from the attacks and petty concerns of the masses. These orders are closedand they are not for sale to even the highest bidders. Yet blood still calls to blood. Weall have this gene and it is not something we inherit as a gift. Not all of us choose toengage with it and turn it on, it is a decision we make from which there can be noreturn, once one has switched on there is no way to be switched off.The call came, slowly at first, when offensive remarks about people I had never met,made by those I did not know, struck home as personal insults, acid vitriol that cut tothe bone. The bitterness of those who have been denied the blessings of gnosis, familyand heritage led to circumstances where beneficial contacts were made. Friendshipsformed, discussion groups shared information and finally mentorship from peoplewhom I could really respect.This was my call, I was coming home to roost, to know at last as I stood beneath thestars in wind and rain that I was not alone, that there were those I knew who would bedoing the same beneath and among the same. A family of sorts, separated by place andwhat seemed impossible distance, although joined through blood and cause. Who I wasand what I was doing was verified by those who were becoming dear to me, thequestions were beginning to be answered.

She gave me passion and purpose within the light ofher love, and we travelled forward together.Connections to others of my kin grew and grew, until that time, beneath the map ofour existence, in the space between the worlds I stood, arm in arm with my brothers andsisters of the craft, there by my own free will, oath sworn and bound to the law, open tothis new world of promise, companionship, company and the love of family.

It isan absolute rebellion against enslavement, where the world above and theworld below are treated with equality. There are no bended knees orprostration for the Stregone, just the word honored by blood anddetermination in the name of freedom. It makes demands upon those of a certaincharacter and disposition; the disposition of a god who sets out to forge his or her Fateand build a world of subjective truth, someone who accepts challenge as fuel for his orher fire. This essay is based on the works of the Maestro Fulvio Rendhell and I will attimes make his words my own, and as such this article can be also considered a tributeto him.There is a widespread tendency to present stregoneria as a sinister deviation ofstregheria, similar to what Carlo Ginzburg speaks of in his Ecstasies. Ginzburg tellshow the witches in Friuli in the 16th century went out to protect the fertility of the landwith fennel stalks. These witches were called benandanti (blessed or benevolent ones).We find accounts of skin-leaping and going forth in the numinous body. These samewitches can in their punitive form appear as malandanti (wicked ones), the enemies offertility and the grain. This distinction seems similar to what we find with St. Claus andKrampus. It is also important to take note of the many comments Ginzburg makes ofthe malandanti being associated with the loup garou or werewolf. Here we have aconnection to Stregoneria as the people of the wolf.Stregheria is peasant craft; it is a view of the world and nature that spins across thetwo pillars of certainty: birth and death. It follows that Stregheria is about fellowshipand family, whether of blood or with allies in the flora and fauna. A Stregone might bepart of a clan or family, but stregoneria itself creates family, one based on therecognition of kinship, not family in the literal sense we find within many houses, clansand families of Traditional Witchcraft. For stregheria, the sanctity of home and hearthis important; it is a beautiful and stabilizing current of power and truth.The connection between stregheria and stregoneria is found in the term Roman,because the Stregone holds a distinctively Roman outlook on the world and being. Bythis I mean the attitude born from the Roman furnace as a people who were fed on the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"milk and blood of wolves. Rome that captured the Sabine women, Roman as in awarrior who twists whatever is found between the pillars of birth and death to the fullextent of his or her numinous consciousness. Roman in finding a way where thereappears to be none.Stregoneria is not about worshipping gods, but about becoming a god. Such anapotheosis is readily available in the very dynamic of the Stregone's art. This is alsowhy the vulgar interpretation of stregoneria is that it is a satanic current. It might be so,but we need to then agree upon a context and meaning for terms like ‘God’ and ‘Satan.’An understanding of this dualistic dichotomy is found in the context of ecclesiasticaltheology. If we want to understand stregoneria as it grew in the shadow of the Church,we need to return to the time from Charlemagne to the papal bull of 1231 spellingexcommunication for heretical clergy as well as baptized commoners now consideredwitches and troublemakers.Until Charlemagne the Roman Catholic Church was truly catholic, with room fornearly all heresies and interpretations. The great purge of Church doctrine, followed byschism and later the reformation holds significance as it tells of the turbulence of thetime. Here then is a glimpse of those conditions. In the biography of Wala,Charlemagne's advisor, we can read about the many accusations and scandals related topoisoning and malefica surrounding the reign of King Louis the Pious (814—40): Therewas witchcraft everywhere. Policy was based not on sound judgment, but on auspices,and forward planning on auguries ... Lot casters, seers, interpreters of omens, mimers,dream mediums, consulters of entrails and a whole crowd of other initiates in themalefic arts were driven out of the palace.Due to the scandals at the castle involving King Louis and the evil acts of Louis’eldest son from his first marriage, Lothar did what he could to take the throne and itended with Lothar inaugurating a campaign of slander and gossip directed towardsLouis’ most influential advisor, Bernhard of Septi-mania, together with the QueenJudith and Bernhard's sister, Gerberga, a nun who was practicing magic. She wasdrowned in a river together with two other nuns. The important point here is that duringthe Carolingian reign an awareness of magic became widespread. In 899 two peoplewere executed because it was believed they had killed the emperor Arnulf withvenefica. In 1028 several women were tried and executed for having killed KingWilliam, Count of Angouleme with magic. Exodus XXII:18: thou shalt not suffer a witchto live moved into the forefront of ecclesiastical paranoia and judgment.In the same period we also find stories of clergy venerating and communing withspirits considered hostile and sinister by the Church, even Lucifer himself. There arealso monks, popes and bishops like Gerbert of Aurillac (Pope Sylvester II, † 999), themonk and Bishop elect Theophilus († 538) and Pope Cælestinus († 4320) who wereaccused of making pacts with the Devil and being more well versed in magic than wasconsidered proper. We even find a story from 1323 telling how some Cistercian monks"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"in St. Denis had offered up a black cat to Lucifer/Satan/the Devil in the hope of findinga thief. These monks were – along with the cat – burned at the stake in consequence ofthe 1231 papal bull of excommunication that gave the death penalty for the practice ofunlawful magic. Stregoneria and the grimoire tradition is intimately entwined in thisand we find Stregones like Cornelius Agrippa instrumental in the preservation ofmysteries though veiled in an acceptable neo-Platonic format.Some have suggested that the Ordine della Luna, passed to Alex Sanders in 1979 byPrince Paleogus is tied to this succession of stregoneria by virtue of being ‘the oldestcoven in the world’ dating to 328 AD. The story of such old covens like Ordine dellaLuna forming in the time of Constantine do hold some truth, but if so, this must havebeen a conclave of philosophers and warriors, people of a Roman bent that saw in theChurch just another illusion of truth that they had no problems entering into. The valueof Ordine della Luna for this essay is not to verify its claims, nor to dismiss them, butsimply to state that it is not unreasonable to believe that a group of likeminded Romansgathered together under the Cross. However, if such a meeting was a reality they werenot a witch coven, more a monastic warrior conclave, a Roman fraction. After all,Christianity is just another mythology to be accepted or rejected.Still, we cannot say that stregoneria is Christian or that they were for a time a Christiandenomination, rather we might say that certain clerics were Stregones that tookadvantage of the public religion on their own terms, with their own truths. We need tounderstand that stregoneria is a path of sorcery focusing on the ensorcelment of thewizard or witch in the making – so he or she can be truly divinely free, like a god.It follows that paganism is also a problematic term to apply to stregoneria. It is notpaganism. In fact, paganism did not exist for those that were called pagans; again wefind it to be an insult, like witch or sorcerer being attached to people and practitionersrefusing to submit to the demands of taming the people and their practices. What isclear is that these people whom we today call pagans, be they Greek, Roman orEgyptian had no concept of evil, nor accepted that an institution like the Church had a‘god-given’ right to limit their expansion of consciousness, or to bar their becoming agod.Naturally such inclinations do not harmonize well with religions like Christianity thataim to sanitise and civilise people who insist on being free, and thus biased terms suchas Satanism get easily attached to stregoneria. It is the condemnation of the untamed,those that insist on personal freedom who are vilified and it is perhaps in this prejudicewe can detect a pure and legitimate flame of the original mysteries. It follows thatstregoneria has nothing in common with modern renderings of witchcraft passingthemselves off as stregoneria or stregheria as cults of nature worship. Stregoneria wasnever about this; it was the path of the enlightened individual, the enflamed warrior thatsought godhood for himself. Stregoneria took a more formal format when Roman"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"legions saw in the Lugh of the Celts their own god of magic and necromancy, LuciferInvictus – a solar consciousness – father of Stregones. From this time an unbrokentradition can be traced. Hints of the existence of this clandestine cult are found scatteredin Roman crypts and ecclesiastical documents for those who know what they arelooking for.In the Roman myths, Lucifer is seen as an epitaph for any deity that gifts an increaseof consciousness or light. It is also the name given to a minor god, associated with thetorch, as light bringer. He is the torch of the underworld in the hands of Phanes, Dianaand Hecate, but in truth he is the Sun fallen black, the Sol Niger, and thus it is in themysteries of Mithras his cult found a succession as it was patronised by Stregones.Lucifer is an impulse, a constant explosion of light, a big bang if you will. His legacyhas little to do with modern materialist ideas that see Lucifer as the antithesis of God.Lucifer is his own truth, a particular form of consciousness in a succession of forms thatdance across matter in constant bursts of light.Deities such as Lucifer have been coloured, re-coloured, understood and re-understood in a succession of cultures, all of them bringing their subjectiveperspectives. By mentioning Lucifer you might assume that there are gods who belongto the ‘pantheon’ of stregoneria, but they only belong insofar as the Stregone candemonstrate the importance of these gods in their lives. Gods and spirits make up theworld and the type of relationship we build with the world is always personal. Thepersonal relationship we forge with the spirits and gods that make up the world will inturn be forces useful to our freedom and our chosen path. Hence, we cannot speak ofany pantheon of gods in the modern neo-Pagan vernacular.The Stregone will never kneel to any god, unless he or she kneels to their ownreflection, this is done in reverence and respect, never in worship. By bending yourknees in worship you resign your fate, your light and your fire to someone else, and thisis anathema to the ethos of the Stregone. Because of such considerations there is atendency to view stregoneria as antinomian. It might be so, but it would be misleadingto see a path of spiritual freedom and deification as antinomian per se. It will only bepotentially antinomian if the tamed and civilised hinders the freedom of the Stregone.This does not mean that stregoneria is a form of anarchism or nihilism. Rather it is ahermetic discipline of sorcery that demands intuition, knowledge and awareness of needand fire. It is not about violent acts upon the world and its political systems andreligious institutions; it is a path of knowledge that insists on unveiling the secretsnature holds so they can be utilised to the Stregone's benefit both as a social actor andas a god in the making.It should also be mentioned that there is little relevant in the work of G. Leland toStregoneria. If anything is relevant in Leland's Aradia it is the connection betweenAradia, Herodias and Lucifer. This is also found in Paul Huson's Mastering Witchcraft.Huson speaks of how the Great Darkness, Diana, divided herself into two equal and"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"opposite forces, night and day. Diana assumed rulership over the night as the moon andgave the day to her brother-son-lover, Lucifer. With feline seduction Diana begot achild with her son and Huson says this was Aradia or Herodias. This holds relevance forstregoneria as we shall see, but this child, Herodias/Aradia was solely a continuation ofthe theme of Lilith and holds a very different value for the Stregone than for those whoworship her.The inspirited human is composed of myriads of particles of consciousness, we areliterally legion, and this opens up an endless plethora of possibilities in our self-deification. Therefore the only worthy rituals for a Stregone are those that call upon thegods of belonging that fit with our consciousness, the consciousness ruled by need andinstinct. It is from this we can form true intent. We take what is objective and abstractand through the bond we make, we make it a part of our own expansion as we build thebest conditions possible for this to manifest. Change, transformation and ordeal are ourscythe-bearing allies in this brutal yet delicate work of self-deification. After all, if wefail or if we are found victorious, if we veil ourselves in the illusions of Maya orexplode into consciousness, it is our choices that make it happen. Nature is as she is, itis up to our ability to understand how to use her secret storehouse that makes thedifference. Nature is like a furnace, what we gain from it depends on our perspectiveand the constitution of our consciousness and intuition.In truth, there are no secrets. Everything is there for he or she who dares to uncoverwhat is veiled. It is about the urge to be free – a freedom consistent with one's‘atmosphere,’ or state of consciousness as being. The secret is simply how to follow thepath that you choose. We know the path is right when it leads to freedom. It is aboutfreedom from ignorance as we grow wiser with each step. It is about freedom from theprison of reason; freedom from social obstruction and institutions of shame andcaptivity. We are speaking of the freedom to fulfill your divine promise. Freedomchanges people around you, by sharing the light of freedom you will never disempowerpeople, but rather inspire them.By living for the challenge you will be in a constant state of illumination, your torchwill flicker and blaze in the air of freedom and possibility so you can both take andattract what is rightly yours. Be wise, but never forget to be overwhelmed by thepassions of existence, to be intoxicated with life and pleasure until you feel you cannottake it anymore, then, take it further.It is by taking matters to the extreme and then crossing over that you can realise theworld is not singular. Rather, what is perceived as singular is composed of an endlessgathering of forms that are in motion and adapt to the world dictated by their ownstrategies for existence. These forms, specters of conscious light and stars are what wecall gods.But let us return to nature. After all, it is nature that gives us the possibility of making"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"our path. Nature is She who appears as a mirror. We can, for instance, see her showingherself as Diana when social systems are in jeopardy and as Juno when renewal istaking form. We should however remember that Diana is a fierce goddess, she is virgin.All of nature is of a female orientation. She is a panorama of expressions, a garden ofstars and possibilities. The male quality however is a violent force, almost an intrusion(by fire, force and direction) that holds the capacity of adapting and transforming thispanorama. Because of this violence Lilith in one form or the other tends to be intrinsicto stregoneria. It is also here we find attempts at defining stregoneria as left hand path –which in the proper context of vama marga and its veneration of woman and yoni iscorrect – but also Satanists tend to rise up and mirror themselves in the Stregone. Thisis quite understandable, but there is no Satan as such in stregoneria. If ‘Satan’ is used, if‘antichrist’ is used, they are used as references to magnetic forms of consciousness, away of explaining and understanding a point, not a reality. By logical dissemination: ifSatan is God's adversary we need to admit some sort of relevance for this God he isopposing. This in turn depends on the acceptance of the Christian mythology, and withthis rejected, Satanism in its modern form tends to be meaningless. It is still possible touse such terminology to bring more light to the matter so to speak, so Lilith can be thecourtesan and wife of Satan if we ensure that the premises underlying our understandingare correct.If we return to the Bible we see that the figure of Satan represents a very differentperspective upon matters, and his role as a challenger is exactly the kind of power theStregone deems necessary on the path of self-deification. Satan becomes the power ofcontrast, it is not the power of our opponents; no, it is the power that refuses to kneel toan unhappy fate or institutions void of light and consciousness. But in the Bible he isgiven a distinct personality, and a direction that goes counter to everything that is good.Well, this is one perspective, but surely not the only one.Similarly we find Ishtar and Astarte, deities far older than the Bible, who inecclesiastical writings have been introduced as prostitutes and deities of ill repute.These were deities that outside the Abrahamic perspective were seen as dignifiedmanifestations of stellar potencies. Accepting Satan as the enemy of man and Ishtar as awhore depends entirely upon whether you accept Christian mythology as true or not.What is clear is that these deities predate the composition of the revised and re-revisedBible we have today. Perhaps their massive influence and their call for freedom was thereason for editing them out from the holy books pulled together by civil religion?There are clearly significant gaps in the Bible, where traditions like Stregoneria havesecured a transmission of the knowledge that it attempted to eradicate. For instance inGenesis I:27 we read that:So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; maleand female He created them."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Then in Genesis II:7 we read that God breathed life into Adam and that God createdwoman from his flesh and bone so he would not be so lonely. So, in the first chapterman and woman are created as divine manifestations, mirrors of God. Then one chapterlater only man is made, from earth, and given divine breath. Later comes a servilewoman that god made to be Adam's submissive partner – a creation myth proper for anycivic religion that seeks to tame passions and intuition. Clearly we have a variety ofcreation myths already in the first two chapters of Genesis that for the Stregone speaksof the obvious: the predominance of Lilith. Lilith is important in this context, becauseshe is a cosmic manifestation of the spirit of earth – a transcendence of matter if youwill – that replicates the self-deification of the Stregone. Lilith did not cause atransformation in the world, she transformed herself. She did this so she could movebetter in the worlds of her choosing. As such she became a mirror that reflects how aparticular truth can be achieved, attracted and integrated. We hold the potential oftransposing our light caught in matter onto our numinous body upon death. As Lilithachieved this, then it can be done again. This is the path of the Stregone.For the Stregone Lilith is the cosmic terrorist, she is what explodes in renewedessence constantly; she is the stellar succubus and the black moon. She is the frustrationof the worlds because she recreates herself anew. She is chaste as a whore and holds asmany lovers as any mother. She is found to be exceptionally active in what is known asthe via lilithia which concerns the 15 ̊, 16 ̊ and 17 ̊ of the sign of Libra. She is Algolwhen the Moon is new in the signs of Venus and she loves the four towers to be filledwith Mercury. These are auspicious stellar junctures for the work of the Stregone, as itis here the Stregone recreates themselves.The constant transformation that takes place on the path gradually fills us with intuitiveknowledge, and wisdom grows from this. This process begins when we gestate in thewomb and enter this world; our first magical act. The question is, whether we havesufficient awareness and knowledge to make this happen at the birth of our death.This leads to the power of need, as it takes the form of determination. Need is thevery forge that defines the Stregone. In the execution of need we must be aware thatthere seems to be a barrier between reason and intuition, or perhaps there is a polaritythere that if one enlarges reason, intuition will also grow. The goal must however be tobreak the bonds of reason, because it is only outside reason we can meet other gods.There is a particularity with reason, which is about obscuring the individual with ideasof power and domination. Reason is not an ally of the Stregone, but the prison guard.Breaking the boundaries of reason will set free the original flame of intuition thatbreeds knowledge. It is only in this field we can start to grasp the ‘divine beings’ asthey appear in their many forms. Intuition is the fuel for growth. The child does notgrow up because of reason, but because of intuition. Reason is considered the product ofa sanitized and civilized human being. Naturally, this is not how reason is – just one of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"its many modalities – the way the modern era understands reason and this overarchingunderstanding of this faculty contaminates us with restraints.The Stregone is very well aware that our strategies and the magic we use to alter andcontrol life and fate are tools we are using to move in the world more elegantly, withmore cunning. But this does not mean that this offers a possibility for escaping theresponsibilities we have in this world. Even if the Stregone lives in a world of dreams,the planes are never confused and the realities are approached on their own premisesfrom the given perspective of the Stregone. No matter what world the Stregone movesin, he or she will move in an absolute and intense fashion. Every world, every challenge,every paradox is an opportunity to learn how to attract the best things possible. Theworld of dreams, the other world, is what builds us in this world, and it is from theworld of intuition ruled by the moon in which actions are formed and can revealknowledge.A Stregone must be intensely aware to be the best of his or her ability, so he or she isconstantly the summit of the possibilities of expansion. Stregoneria is about finding thepath that expands your consciousness; it is the art of deifying yourself. It is aboutfreedom and the meeting with gods as an equal. It is about transforming yourself, likeLilith transformed herself – to become, to be and forever be – true to yourself inconstant self-creation as your consciousness expands and explodes like the light weknow as Lucifer.

These are the lightning strikes ofserpent-born inspiration that light our way through the mists of the mind.For us the mist is divine, it is the unformed potential from which all things emerge. Inthe mountains, fog can hide the sure road and the precipice; angel and demon await usin the fog, always present, waiting to be found and named. We are constantly wadingthrough the fog of our mind, seeking to name our experiences, seeking identity. For mypeople, there are ultimately two expressions which are essential to our identity: euskera,the Basque language, and etxe, house.Our mother tongue, euskera, gives us voice, shaping how we see the world, andperhaps even how the worlds see us. Our identity as a people is so wrapped up within itthat our name for ourselves, euskaldunak (basques), means those who speak euskera. Tobe Basque, you must speak Basque, and to speak Basque makes one Basque. But themetaphor of language can be extended to all aspects of life, examining all aspects ofculture as types of language, including religion.The etxe is the true temple of the Land, built upon the ways of life which find theirtruest expression in modazaharrak (the old ways). Each of us carves out of the world aplace of our choosing, and the etxe in turn is not only the physical structure, but anintersection of land and shelter, sustenance and solace, temple and tomb, the living andthe dead, forming within it a community of reciprocity that outlives the individual andyet informs their journey in life.There are those that might debate whether a house is truly a sign of traditional craft,and I would propose that all too often in our search for ourselves we ignore that whichis right in front of us, favouring the fat over the meat, the coarse over the subtle. ForBasques, it is euskera that gives us mind, and when given form, modazaharrak becomemanifest as etxe – a true expression of traditional mindset in euskalerria (the Basquecountry).As a named, living entity, the etxe is more than the material building. Echoing thethree principles of alchemy it is composed simultaneously of the physical house – etxe(salt); the property – etxeondo (sulphur); and the inhabitants – etxekoak (mercury).

Han bizi naiz ni bakean.It is there that I dwell in peace.Jean Baptiste Elizanburuhe first dwellings of our most ancient ancestors were the cliffs and caves ofthe mountains themselves, and there is much in traditional Basque thoughtthat seems to have inherited the worldview of these ancient mountaindwellers. Shared resources under an established matriarchy centered around acult of fire, and deep reverence for the ways of the bear (embodied in the stories of theHartzkume) as a model of behavior and good judgement for mountain forest survival.We find the old ways still strong today. The caves at Santimamiñe in Bizkaia showcontinued occupation from the Middle Paleolithic until the Iron Age, just before Romanoccupation. Whilst a definitive record for such continued Basque presence in thesecaves is lacking (but not implausible), in our cultural memory, the identification withthe caves, peaks and valleys of our beloved Pyrenees will always persist. For thesemountains, that in the ancient mind grow and age as living beings, with characters all oftheir own, have given birth to our people. Even the Sun and Moon, the daughters of theEarth itself, must return to the folds of the Earth, retreating to their own houses beneaththe surface, echoing the cave-homes of our forebears. While Eguzki (the Sun) lights thedaytime and the world of the living, her sister Ilargi (the Moon) lights the night and theworld of the dead. This separation of responsibility is reflected in the division of labourin the house as well, for both the living and the dead play their part in the maintenanceof the etxe.Our ancestors found a stone tower to be easily defendable – a place where theinhabitants of a given area could retreat to in times of conflict. Many includedcourtyards which provided insular storage and more defensive capabilities. These typesof structure are not uncommon in medieval architecture; stone towers, either round orroughly square, with an elevated entrance whose wooded stairs could be burned fordefensive purposes in times of danger. These dorreak, from the Castillian torre (tower),are necessarily related to the casa-torre of greater Spain. However, these largerstructures received heavy attention from the Spanish and French governments, seeking"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"to end centuries of territorial partisan conflict. Dorreak were either razed or convertedto more peaceable dwellings. The average peasant did not live in these fortifications,but rather in wooden huts tightly clustered together that housed people, animals andhay, with additional shacks for other livestock, cider pressing, and granaries. Thedefensive dorreak combined with the needs of the mountain farmers and led to thejauregiak (manor houses), and eventually to the baserriak (Basque farmhouses).The baserriak allowed the people whose needs were dependent upon mountainagriculture and animal husbandry to truly become established. By the 15th and 16thcenturies, new enterprises in Andalusia and the Americas brought wealth and an influxof New World crops, most notably, maize. Shifts in law codes allowed private divisionof land and the baserri became the standard form of Basque mountain life. While thereare those that moved to the larger cities, themselves urban expressions of the dream ofRome, manifested lavishly in either Spanish or French form, even the kaletarrak (citydwellers, derived from Latin kale, street) looked to the baserritarrak (country dwellers)as representatives of the older ways, the quintessential Basques. It is ultimately thebaserri that manifests the tradition of the etxe with singular expression. It is the baserrithat helped preserve our language and culture despite the assaults of the wolves ofpolitics and modernity.The wild land and forest becomes ordered by the baserri, whose very name expressesthis, from baso (wild) and herri (settlement, town). Baserriak generally follow a setlayout and construction. Traditionally facing east or south-east, both to protect from thewinds of the North and West, as well as to face the rising Sun, symbol of life andvictory, the stone and wood constructed building is almost always rectangular. Theearlier constructions, a stone-built ground floor houses livestock, all family members,and a large sloping gable-roof provides a spacious attic area which serves as a dryingand storage area, often open on one or both sides to allow for ventilation. In time, thebaserri became three stories: the ground floor housing the stables for cattle, storage forcarts and tools, the kitchen; the first floor housing the human inhabitants; the atticreserving its previous use as a storage and drying room. It is this typical baserri thatmost basques will have in mind when we speak of the basque etxe. The sacredness ofthis structure is evident in beliefs that are told of both Church and house, which cautionagainst circling either three times – which will grant one the ability to see the dead, orknowledge and union with the Devil, or the company of witches, or even death.Sugabeko etxea, gorputza odolgabeaA house without fire is a body without blood"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ot all houses are created equal. While the physical structure is what qualifies ahouse, for the traditional Basque this place must have su, fire. In the strictest,most literal sense, this refers to the subazter (the hearth-fire) the seat of powerin a house, located in the sukaldea (kitchen, literally fireside). But beyondthese necessities of cooking and warmth, the hearth fire is considered the dwelling ofthe spirit of Mari, the very numen of the Land. A spirit of order and mountain survival,Mari demands honesty and responsibility, a sharing of resources and upright character,herself reflecting the conduct demanded by fire. The hearth-fire protects by its verypresence, and guarantees the sacredness and authority of the etxe. In the physicalbuilding, this protection extends to the ate (door) itself, traditionally stained with ochre,oil and ox-blood, making a protective and vitalizing colour that also hints at a deeperunderstanding of the old jaunak (spirits) – for is this not an echo of the mighty red bullAatxegorri – defender of the ways of Mari, guarding the entrance and preserving thesanctity of the house? While Basque houses are often bare in decoration, the front doorand the hearth both retain a similar sacredness. There is indar (strength) in this fire thatgives warmth and light to the etxe, easing the cold of night, and adur (magical force)flowing from the living flame embodied in the subazter, that extends not only to the ate,but to the entire etxe, shedding light upon the unknown. Tended by an older woman, thesubazter must be cared for with respect, and great care must be taken to see that it is litaccording to ritual tradition, and by the preparation of food at the hearthfire, acommunion of flame is extended to the inhabitants of the house itself through the foodeaten. Indeed, the scraps of food that fall by the fireside become food for the dead of theHouse, whose presence is reified by the same elders, lighting candles to aid their way onthe spirit roads, and making additional small food offerings on the windowsills so thatthey may find rest within the walls of the house they once lived and died to support,keeping their presence strong, extending the fire of the house to all its inhabitants,living and dead.The fire is not only maintained by these actions, but can be extended as a protectiveforce through the use of certain plants and tools. We can harness the force of arantza(thorn branches) to protect the house and guard its fertility, lizarra (ash branches) tokeep it strong and the hearth fire burning, and eguzkilorea (wild thistle flower, literallysun flower) to ward off those spirits in the night that seek to harm us. We can plantintxaurondo (walnut) and erramu (laurel) for protection from lightning and curses andplace an axe by the door for protection during storms. This harnessing of the adur andindar of the world around us is where traditional craft finds its expression – for each ofus seeks to be master of ourselves. This starts with the etxe, but one might ask – wheredoes the etxe truly begin and end? Is not the fire kindled in the heart of each person? Itis these walls that truly give us identity. I am brought to wonder, which boundaries aremutable, and which are firm?"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Izena duen guztiak izatea ere badauke.Everything with a name exists.Basque proverbEach etxe has a name, one bestowed upon it, not ordinarily chosen by its residents. Itmay describe the physical characteristics of the house, or its location, or age. A newlybuilt baserri may be called Etxeberria (New House), one nearest a bridge may beZubiondo (By the Bridge), one in a muddy stretch of land may be Loiola (MuddyPlace). What is evident though, is that the name of the etxe is ultimately moreimportant than the names of the inhabitants. In rural areas, a person is first known bythe name of their house, and secondly their first name. If you move into a house, youwill assume the name of the etxe, whether temporarily or permanently. The dead of thehouse also become the responsibility of the current owners. This is in contrast to mostnaming systems in Europe, where some version of inheriting the father's surname incombination or apart from the mother's is the norm. In modern times, althoughpatronymic surnames are used with greater frequency, in the more rural areas, it is stillthe name of your etxe that is important. In a craft environment, this name will equallyextend to all those adopted as a part of the family's ways. All labour and effort supportsthe house, for one's identity finds expression within the etxe, not apart from it.The mere act of receiving a name from the neighbouring houses imbeds the etxe andits inhabitants in a larger community. Thus it is identification with an etxe that givesone a sense of collective, an act which by its very nature grants one a certain benefit,and hints at a larger concept of legea egin, keeping the law, which can be interpreted aspositive engagement in societal contract. Just as membership in an etxe benefits theindividual, the etxe's participation in the larger community grants that etxe a certainpower. These roles can be examined and weighed both for their benefit and detriment,and ultimately participation in societal norms is expected to reap the benefits of thesame society. While what happens in my etxe is for me and mine, outside my etxe, Iwill be expected to act in a way that does not bring dishonour to my house, and whenvisiting another, to honour the ways of their etxe. The autonomy of each etxe isimportant and the good name of each etxe reflects that – for anything named exists bythe power of that name. ETXEONDO · THE LAND THAT DIES TO LIVE he Pyrenees, those mountains which shelter and give strength to theeuskaldunak, have shaped our identity and how we relate to property. Inaddition to the physical house, each etxe sits upon land for which it acts astemple and caretaker, the etxeondo. This land is an extension of the etxeitself, or, more correctly, the etxe is naturally an extension of the land. The word"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"etxeondo itself is telling of this subtlety, for -ondo translates to trunk or tree. If a fig ispiko, then the fig tree is pikondo. The etxeondo is the tree that supports the etxe, whichis its fruit. Similarly, as a fruit contains all the potential for an entirely new tree (thewishes and lives of each inhabitant), such potential exists in each and every fruit itbears. In this way we remember that an etxe is an outgrowth of the tree that is etxeondo,having the characteristics of the tree from which it grew, but it is the tree that must bemaintained and made to thrive, not the fruit at the expense of the tree.The land, of which the etxe is the temple, will ideally be self-sufficient and producefood and wood and necessities for those who work it. This emphasis on self-sufficiencyis the ideal, but it is part of a greater belief that growing food is an act of communionwith the land. Even in the cities, where small apartment living has become the norm, itis not uncommon to see memories of the etxeondo's fecundity in window boxes andsmall garden plots that will always grow at least a few edible items. This drivingconcept of lurlandu, working the earth, reflects a deeper need to generate and to givelife to the land that in turn gives us life. The barns which house the larger livestockwere, and often still are, part of the ground floor of many baserri, and even when aseparate building is employed, it is still considered part of the etxe, and its inhabitants,part of the etxeondo.There is more to the etxeondo than just the fields and portions of woods surroundingthe etxe. It is the story of the soil itself, of the etxe and its former inhabitants thatanimates the land. For the mystery of the etxe is not that one inherits the ancestral blooddead, but rather, the etxe is responsible for the dead of the house, and they are eternallypart of that etxe, for it is upon their shoulders that the house stands. In ancient times, weknow the etxe was a tomb itself, and this practice is echoed in the modern era whereunbaptized infants are buried just under the eaves of the roof, still protected from theelements by the physical house. The previously mentioned offering of bread, money andcandles upon windowsills for the dead also hints at the relationship of the dead to thewalls of the house. As the ministers of the etxe are the revered etxekoandreak (womenof the house), in death the collective force has come to be known in traditional craft asAmak, the Mothers. These dead mothers and witches of the land are contained in thesoil itself – they receive due praise and are the means by which the land can express itswisdom in a means understandable to those with ears to hear. It is here the ancientmystery of Erditse is encountered, that veiled First Mother, who ensures the land will betended, and the dead will have their voice.The jarleku (place of seating) may have originally been incorporated into thesubazter, and while the physical evidence of it is limited, our oral history tells us thatthe bones of the most recently departed dead of the house were kept there. It was herethat the etxekoandre would commune with the dead of the house and land. After thearrival of Christianity, the practice of burying the house dead adjacent to the physicalbuilding was replaced by burial in the churchyard and the jarleku became a part of each"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Church. Here is where the institution of etxe prevails – for in death, as the members of ahouse belong to the house eternally, so too does each etxe extend its etxeondo in thejarleku. The jarleku is a sacred space, a slab of stone with the name of the etxe on thefloor of the Church, which in some parishes still entomb the most recent dead of thehouse – this slab is part of the etxe whose name it bears, and while physically in theChurch, is part of the etxeondo. For while the priests of Mother Rome may believe theycontrol the churches, high in the protective folds of the mountains, Basques will beBasques, and the etxe will prevail.Not only are the jarlekuak part of the etxeondo, but so too are the hilbideak, the pathsof the dead. The route that the coffin is carried from each respective etxe to the Churchis unique, and it too, is contained in the etxeondo. These spirit roads are essential asthey connect the jarleku to the etxe, ensuring that the dead know their way to and fromthe house. In some areas it is still traditional that when a new bride moves into herhusband's house, she will circle the subazter, walk along the hilbide of that house, circlethe jarleku and return by the same route to the subazter. While these are the traditionsof the etxekoandreak as ministers to the dead of each etxe, the etxeondo also extends tothe mountain high pastures where the shepherds graze their flocks.The sarobe, or alternatively sel or olha, is a means of marking land used for grazing ordemarcating a part of the forest that, although possibly separated from the physicaletxe, could still be part of the etxeondo. Using a circle of border stones, the sarobemarked an area of land that was claimed, whether privately or in common betweencertain etxeak in an area. In its center we find the autsarri, or ashtone. This pillar ofrock is a monument of stability and claim to the land, directly linked to the steadfastNorth Star, and the border stones to the very cycles of the year. The autsarri is the buru(head) that draws the sugeak, the serpent powers of the land, and burns with the fire ofsacrifice that is, for the outside, what the subazter is for the inside. This division of landby circles of stones echoes an ancient means of claim, and expresses the ideals ofcyclical rotation, or aldikatzia.Aldikatzia is the means by which community takes care of itself. Just as the name ofa house places it in the larger context of community, a property of the etxeondo is theconcept of lehen auzo, or first neighbour. In addition to caring for the etxe and thedeceased members of the etxe, each house is responsible for a neighbouring house withregards to the distribution of ritually blessed items, usually to the right, proceedingclockwise and mirroring the mysteries of Eguzki (the Sun), whose beauty gives life tothe world. Similarly, in the instance of death in a house, one's closest neighbours willassist the house in the tasks needing doing, and, as the office of lehen auzo isoverlapping, the help proceeds to the left, reflecting the mysteries of Ilargi (the Moon),the light of the dead, and for some, death herself. Thus the rings of mutual aid anddistribution, division of labour and ritual office are interwoven, and the larger concept"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"of etxeondo is firmly rooted under the watchful eyes of Janicot (Jainko, the On-HighLord). ETXEKOAK · THE BLOOD THAT WALKS Jan behar baduzu, lan egin beharko duzu.If you must eat, then you must work.Basque proverbhe land calls to itself. It will either be of the baso (the wild), or through theprocess of lurlandu (working the earth), that it gives rise to etxe. While thebaso is highly respected and seen as a place of great natural power andresources, when the land is worked it is here where the blood of the landbecomes manifest and the ministers to this Temple assume their place. The truecaretakers of the land, the intermediaries of the flow between etxe and etxeondo, are theetxekoak, meaning those that belong to the House. In euskera, the inhabitants of a housebelong to that house, not the reverse, which itself represents a departure from commonconventional ideas of ownership.The oldest traditions have three generations living together, the oldest generationbeing supported by the efforts of the two younger. The elder pair are the etxekoandreand nagusi (master). Often the epithet zahar (old) is added to signify them as the eldersof the house, the middle generation uses the same titles, but often with the epithet gazte(young) or berri (new). The etxekoandre and nagusi are most often husband and wife,but this is not always the case, especially with the zaharrak. The youngest of the threegenerations are the children of the middle generation. One of them, often the first-bornor one deemed most competent, regardless of sex, will be chosen to inherit the etxe intime. These particular laws of inheritance go back centuries, and directly contradictedthe feudal laws of the time. The ability of a house to perpetuate its legacy was and is ofextreme importance, and was a prime example of the foruak, or old laws, that theBasques demanded be protected by the Crown of Spain, embodied in the Mighty Oak,tree of Truth and Oath, which at Gernika (Guernica), is a testament to Basque autonomyas well as its subjugation.Clad in black from head to foot, face obscured by lace and holding the coiled waxserpent whose tongue gives Light to the Dead, there is no person that represents the etxemore strongly than the etxekoandre (woman of the house), chief spiritual leader of eachetxe. She is first among the ministers of the cult of etxe, for it is she that extends theblessing of the Dead, she that maintains order within the House, she that holds thefinancial control, she that maintains the traditions of reciprocity to the largercommunity, and she that educates future generations in tradition. It is she that observesthe subtle relationships of land and blood between the living and the dead, and tends to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"the black earth that is the Dragon beneath our feet. Her authority extends not only in theetxe proper, but in the jarleku and hilbideak, presiding over the religious life of herfellow etxekoak.When the etxekoandre of a given etxe cannot be present at the Church to serve at thejarleku, it is the serora that takes over. Just as each etxekoandre serves the etxe, theserora is herself perhaps a compromise between the Church and modazaharrak. It is shewho holds the keys to the Church (as protector and guardian), and serves the needs ofthe etxekoandreak of the community, filling in where necessary for obligations at eachjarleku, and tending to the physical needs and organization within the Church in tandemwith the priest. While this office has greatly declined in the last half century, especiallywhen coupled with the etxekoandre, it speaks of the high place of women in the affairsof the Basques.Both should be physically and emotionally strong, hard-working, and willing to co-operate with each other, as well as with the other members of the household.Considerable emphasis is placed on strength of character. Extreme submissivenessin either sex is deplored, for it allows one sex to dominate the other.Sanda Ott, Circle of MountainsMen and women are said to be bardin-bardina (equal) in responsibilities. Other than theset offices of etxekoandre and her assistant, called neska (girl), and the rank of nagusiand the duties of the men as shepherds in the sarobe, work is assigned and duty assumedbased on ability with regards to the farm work regardless of sex. Etxekoak are expectedto provide alkar laguntza (mutual aid) inside and outside the house with regards tochores.When death strikes, the house bands together. Elaborate funerary traditions seek tounite the recently departed with the honoured dead of their etxe. The older expressionsinvolve interment in the jarleku until another of the etxe dies, their gogo (spirit) nowacting as a messenger between the world of the dead and the world of the living throughthe etxekoandre.The deceased etxekoak make their presence known by rising out of earth as lights,flames, clouds, winds, shadows, draped figures, or patterns in the ashes of the hearth,and their wishes are interpreted by the etxekoandre of each house. They may be enlistedfor blessing, advice, defence just as the living may, and are also said to help witheginbeharrak (tasks that must be done).One could wonder if in ancient times the title of etxekoak was applied also toanimals, or to certain types of animals. Consider the keeping of erleak (bees), who areheld in such high esteem, that upon the death of a house member, the etxekoandre willprocess to the erletxe (beehive), drape it in black cloth, and inform them: Jauna il dek,ta eizuelan ari argi eiteko (The Master is dead, and we need you to go to work to make"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"light for him). They must be asked to assist, not coerced, and their presence or absencein the hive can speak to the strength of the etxe itself, and should they be offended, theywill leave.The spheres of influence between men and women vary from town to town, andcertainly in the higher mountain enclaves there is less French and Spanish influence andit is here where we see a mutability in role. However, during the height of the Basquewhaling trade, men often left the etxe in the hands of the women to pursue wealth andprestige, and eventually, as navigators and crewmen on expeditions to the Americas tothe same end. It is here we find a grave self-dug, and whether from religious zealotry,desire of property, or even ethnic cleansing, the Church began a crusade against theBasques and ‘witchcraft.’ Much of the evidence used against the Basques reveals thoseunique expressions of culture that mark the Basques as other. It is cultivation of thisother blood that drives the current expression of traditional Basque craft, always basedin the concepts embedded within euskera and modazaharrak.In traditional Basque craft, men may find a calling as gizonbeltzak (menin-black),often times called by the Castillian culebros (serpents), who along with selectetxekoandreak, are the Dragon-Ladies and Serpent-Men who work the black and redcurrents of the land for loss or gain, balancing the horizontal pull of the land itself withthe vertical stellar pull of desire. Here in this fertile intersection we find the Black Goat,the preserver and advisor of animal and man. Here too are the twin lights, Eguzki andIlargi, the Sun and the Moon. Our oldest creation myths speak of us being born of thesparks of a great breath of fire, not the origins in clay professed in Christianity, forburning brightly in the center of it all is the living flame, Mari – who for some retainsher traditional name and powers, and for others is now St. Barbara, St. Marina, or theVirgin Mother herself. And it is that flame that guides us, existing in the depths of thesecret caverns of the earth, in the burning hearth-fire of each etxe, and in the beatingheart of the euskaldun. A RACE APART Kanpoan erdera, etxean euskera.Outside, Castillian; inside, Basque.The truth is that the Basque distrusts a stranger much too muchto invite someone into his house who doesn't speak his language.Les Guides Bleus Pays Basque Français et Espangol, 1954."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ithin the conclave of families that seek to preserve specific expressions ofmodazaharrak (the old ways), there are to be found both jentil (pagan) andchristian houses, but the labels of religion are of little import here. A Basque isa Basque first and foremost, and while one house's ways may not be identicalto another's, one is not better than the other – the house's ways must serve the housefirst. Expanding from this centre point are duties to the community as participants incommunal identity, all based in common interests. There is much power in legea egin(social contract), and while the individual may find the restraints of communityconfining at times, the benefits of partaking in it are ultimately a choice that is reifiedthrough experienced blessing or curse.Our own belief in our history as a race apart is engrained within every Basque,regardless of affiliation with traditional craft on a formal or informal level – for everyBasque is, first and foremost – Basque. We are both euskaldunzaharrak (Basques whosemother tongue is euskera) and euskaldunberriak (Basques who learned euskera later,often by choice). But we are bound to each other through that commitment to the tongueof our ancestors. The institution of the house, the etxe, allowed traditional Basque waysto be secured across a landscape whose borders are defined only by a language and thememory of that language. The political divide between Hegoalde (Spanish BasqueCountry) and Iparralde (French Basque Country) is merely that – a political divide, nota cultural one. In a world where others have moved borders around without respect tothe ancient stones, claimed mountains when no mountain can be claimed, and tried toeradicate the living heart of a people – euskera – through government mandate, it is theetxe that must stand firm. Outside the house, the ways of the outside prevail. Inside thehouse, inside the temple, we are ourselves. To our ancestors, the soul was as a flock ofbirds, gathering or diminishing in size and strength throughout our life, and we are allable to gain indar and adur to allow our lives to be our own. This is the power of thesorgin (witch), coming from the words zori (fate) and egin (to make). A sorgin is onewho makes their own fate.

In Europe the forces ofrationalism, Capitalism and industrialism were reaching fever pitch;heralding phenomenal feats of destruction, creation and human endeavourand laying down the infrastructure for a brave new world. The rail road swept westacross America drawing back the primordial virgin lands like a carpet whilst traders andadventurers swept in to Africa and Asia in the wake of the Christian missionaries,spreading their own gospel of distorted humanism and returning with plunder and talesof far off lands. In Europe, towns and cities grew like cancerous tumours sending theircommunication and transport systems like tentacles through the woods, heaths andfields of old Europe. Technology, population, economics and our relationship with theland were all on the move. But where there is a wasteland there is always a woundedking at its heart ... and there too are always green shoots ready to burst through itsdesolate soil.The 1850s seemed to be something of a fulcrum in this age of change. Whilst thewheels of industry turned, the Romantic movement sought to re-establish ourrelationship with the pre-industrial landscape and our inner worlds, and Spiritualismemerged as an international movement striking at the newly formed but seeminglyimmovable edifice of rationalism and materialism. Within a window of a few years,Darwin published his radical new theories on the evolution of species, breaking thechurch's stranglehold on the place of our own species in the universe. Karl Marxpublished his critique of capitalism, striking at the very roots of the dark satanic millsof Europe. In the West of England Andrew Crosse the ‘wizard of the Quantock Hills’was declared evil as he harnessed the powers of the newly discovered phenomena ofelectricity to create life, and declared mad when he prophesised that one day that sameelectricity would allow us to communicate around the world. The great white whaleMoby Dick breached the face of the flood and Herman Melville wrote the greatestGnostic gospel of our age, whilst in the Western Seas the admirality received officialreports on the sighting of a giant sea serpent by a naval patrol in the Atlantic.From the Reformation up until this point there had emerged a breed of workers andweavers of magic known variously as white witches, conjurers or cunning folk. Theyperceived themselves to be quite separate from the charmers of the rural communitieswho specialised in forms of hands-on healing, or the gentleman ghost-layers or theshadowy figure of the witch on the heath. They were a professional class. They seemed"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"to have been both men and women, though Robert Hunt with a hint of irony and humourstates that in the case of malefic magic, the former tended to break the spells whilst thelatter made them! Although they had a precarious relationship with the law, far frombeing peripheral figures they lived and worked very much at the heart of thecommunity, some like Thomasine Blight (whom we will be visiting later) even had apractice on the main street of a busy well-to-do market town. They seem to have beenwidely respected and were patronised by a wide sweep of society. Rather than being onetrick ponies like many of their counterparts, they had a wide repertoire of magicalpractices up their sleeves; including divination, healing, the making or breaking ofspells and the manufacture of charms. Though some made great claims as to thesupernatural origin of their magical skills generally they openly relied on the use ofgrimoires and magical texts and good hard study as their source of power. The idea ofmagic being practiced primarily by uneducated women on the edge of society seems tobe something of a myth. It is a mistake in many ways to think of the general populous inthe early-modern period as being uneducated and illiterate. In the 18th to 19th centurieswith the growth of the non-conformist churches, domestic reading of the scripturesbecame widespread; consequently literacy spread in rural communities. In fact Britainin the 17th century had a very high level of schooling that was not matched until the1940s. This seems to be reflected in the magical practice of the times. Without a doubt,the wave of transformation that took place in the mid 19th century made its mark uponthe world of magic.Certain places in the land seemed to be well-heads from whence this shadow ofchange gushed forth. Cornwall, the most South-westerly extremity of Britain, reachingout in to the Atlantic like a crooked finger, was one such place. As once Cornwall hadsupplied the tin that facilitated the cultural revolution of the Bronze Age, so now fromher fathomless depths she gave forth her bounty to provide much of the knowhow andraw materials to fuel the new industrial revolution. For one brief period the nowdesolate ridge from Camborne down to St. Just was the wealthiest area in the world. TheCornish however were not only limited to their engineering prowess, other luminariesalso emerged. In the far West, Humphrey Davey (who was reputed to have been ofwitch blood) whilst embarking on a career of invention and discovery which laid thefoundations for what we now know as chemistry and physics also wrote a body ofpoetry extolling the magic of the land. He wondered at the incomprehensibleunmanifest forces that formed the material world and communed with shadowy beingson the moors of West Penwith. Upon the craggy cliffs of the north coast, the poet andmystic Reverend Hawker fished shipwrecked sailors from the deep, sung to themermaids and invoked the Sangraal whilst inland on the remote wastes of BodminMoor another luminary emerged, John Couch Adams, who later became president of theRoyal Astronomical society. In 1846 in a feat of mathematical complexity (which eventoday in our age of computer technology is hard to replicate) he discovered Neptune."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"This newly found heavenly orb heralded a crashing wave from the great bitter oceans ofcreation to baptise this new age of dreamers and visionaries. Some, like old CaptainAhab, were consumed by the vastness of the unseen oceans and were lost to the deep,whilst others drew deep of its waters and manifested their dreams. It was at this timethe cult of the Pellar was first recorded in Cornwall.Cornwall in the mid 19th century throbbed with the sound of the beam enginesthroughout her hills and valleys and from her shores her boats sailed out across theseven seas. It was here from the lineage of witches and cunning folk of an earlier agethat the cult of the Pellar emerged. The term first appears in print in 1849 in a Cornishdialect story in the New Monthly Magazine. In 1863, pellar appears again in an articlein the ‘West Briton’ reporting a scandal concerning the Cunning man James Thomas theHusband of the Helston Pellar Thomasine Blight. It appears again in the 1865publication of Robert Hunt's Romances of the West of England and in 1870 in WilliamBottrell's Traditions and Hearthside Stories of West Penwith. (Hunt based much of hiswork on Bottrell's previous writings, but both men were probably collecting theirmaterial around the 1850s. Hunt and Bottrell provide most of the source material for theCornish folklore we now know today.) From then on it begins to appear in Cornishdialect dictionaries and glossaries and seems to enter in to general usage. The roots ofthe word are uncertain. The Cornish term for witch most used are wragh or pystry.Some have speculated that it is a dialect contraction of expeller or repeller, referringring to the Pellar's function as a curse breaker and exorcist or even possibly peddlerowing to their supposedly itinerant and peripatetic habits. Robert Morton-Nance,pioneer of the Cornish Gorsedd and the Cornish language revival traced the word to itsCornish root of pellhe – the verb to cast away. Its origin, however, remains obscure.In Hunt's work the word peller (the spellings pellar and peller seem to be arbitraryand interchangeable, which seems to suggest that the word is drawn from an oral ratherthan literary tradition) is used on several occasions to denote a professional magicalpractitioner. The client would invariably go to visit the Peller. The Peller would usesome form of divination to diagnose the problem, which would invariably be as a resultof ‘ill-wishing’ or ‘the evil eye.’ If the culprit was a spirit then they would be banishedto some far place or chained under a rock (those that proved to be immovable weregiven an impossible task to keep them out of trouble!), or if the malefactor was a humanthen a charm could be constructed to protect the recipient or to return the curse to itssender. Here the Pellar's role is not only social and economic, but also shamanic, as theystand as intermediaries between the world of humans and the world of spirits. It is forthis reason that the Pellar is cognate with the wayside-witch or the hedge-witch, for theytruly stand between the worlds. The Pellar becomes as the old stone stile, where spiritforce may pass from one side to the other. Bottrell, in his work (with his greater use ofnarrative) expands the concept of the Pellar. He tells the tale of the Old man of Cury, inwhich the Lutey family on the Lizard peninsula become a hereditary family of Pellars"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"by making a pact with Morwena – a spirit of the sea. Whereas the witches of Europedraw their power from the Sabbat and the witches of England draw theirs from theirfamiliar spirits, the Pellars of Cornwall draw their virtue from the primordial forces ofthe living rocks and the fathomless ocean.Apart from the fact that the term pellar only seems to have been used in a relativelylocalised area, two other factors make it significantly different to other cunningtraditions. In Bottrell's account, in defending her magical status Thomasine Blightstated that the Virtue was in her, and that she was of real pellar blood. Firstly, theconcept of Virtue was central to the concept of pellar. Virtue is the essence that inhabitsthe being of the pellar which facilitates the working of magic and defines them as amagical entity. It is the spirit force that links the pellar to the spirit world – their sourceof power, and the catalyst by which the spirit world may operate within the world ofmatter. Virtue is described as a kind of energy that could be transferred from person toperson (usually contrasexually) or to and from magically charged objects such ascharms, talisman and magical tools. The greatest of these is the mysterious Milpreve orAdder stone, charm par excellence and Holy Grail of the Pellar, which as well asoffering protection could bestow the gift of virtue upon its bearer. Secondly, the conceptof Pellar blood implies some kind of otherness and heredity in the Pellar. As thoseversed in the artes are aware, this does not necessarily mean a genetic lineage – it mayalso refer to an initiatic lineage, passed on either from pellar to pellar, or directly fromthe spirit world. Whichever way it may be, the implication is that both the definition ofthe Pellar and the modus operandi of their work is of supernatural origin.With the advent of the 20th century, the Pellar cult, along with many of our otherindigenous magical traditions seems to fade away. The bard, folklorist and searcher outof witches William Paynter claimed that the last Cornish cunning man died in 1932, butin retrospect this was a pessimistic and unwarranted final curtain for the Old Craft.Partly this is due to the fact that the social structures that created and supported it wereno longer in place, and partly because our thirst for the spirit world was being quenchedby the new more articulate and popularist magical currents of Spiritualism, Theosophy,the growing Western Mystery traditions (which sprung from the ashes of the Hermeticorder of the Golden Dawn) and finally Wicca and its associated Neo-Pagan traditions.Ironically however it was from these camps that also came the revival of the Pellartradition. In the early 1960s self-styled traditional witch Robert Cochrane in describinghis magical tradition wrote:I come from the country of the oak, ash and thorn ... I describe myself as a ‘Pellar’... The people are formed in clans and families and describe themselves by the localname of the deity.Cochrane began a movement amongst occultists of orientation towards their traditional"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"roots. But above all he made the salient point that it is not so much the magical practiceinherent in a magical tradition that defines its nature, but the deity that overshadows it,for that is the point from which your tradition emanates. In the early 1980s, researcherRobin Ellis made contact with the remnants of a Pellar cult on the Lizard peninsula inCornwall (of which Surrealist poet Peter Redgrove was involved). From hisconversations he wrote a series of articles for the Meyn Mamvro Journal in the early1990s. He describes the Pellars as: the nature mystics and shaman of Cornwall. LikeCochrane he saw the role of the Pellar as both magical and mystical. He describes theirtask as being to manifest the serpent virtue of the land within the being of the Pellar byunifying its light and shadow aspects, thus developing a transpersonalsuperconsciousness:The aim of the Pellar is to finish the task started many thousands of years ago bytheir predecessors in Lyonesse.Lyonesse being the Cornish ‘Atlantis,’ the mythical source of the lore and the virtue ofthe Pellar now sunk beneath the waves. As I write these words I sit in an old disusedgranite quarry in West Cornwall. Beyond there broods a hill once crowned with cairns,in times gone by known as the Pellarstone. Still further West lays the Lizard peninsulaand a blood red sunset over a sea where once the forests of the southern shores ofLyonesse stretched out to its holy western mountain. Looking out one cannot help butask the question, who indeed is the deity who lies in the heart of Pellar?Bottrell recounts the following tale entitled A legend of Tolcarn. One day in 1592some of the fishermen of Mousehole (Mowzle) were out mending their nets when thedevil passed by. The devil took it into his head that he wanted to go fishing, so hesnatched up their nets and tried to make a getaway. Unfortunately for him the fishermenalso happened to be members of Paul church choir. They lost no time in following inhot pursuit chanting the Apostle's Creed, the Lord's Prayer and any other prayers thatcame to hand. The Devil left Tredavoe road and in one giant leap from Captain Tonkin'sorchard crossed the valley to the blue elvan crag of Tolcarn. His mighty hoof sank intothe rock leaving its imprint to this day. The devil however was still within the influenceof those cursed psalms and prayers, so realising that he could not escape with his bootyhe raised himself up to his full height belching sulphurous smoke from his mouth,fiercely uttered three times Buckah, Buckah, Buckah, and dropped his nets upon therock. This strange cry Bottrell interprets as a prophesy of the forthcoming Spanishattack in 1595, in which Paul, Newlyn and Mousehole were razed to the ground. Thecall however appears to be of an infinitely more arcane origin. This story appears againrecorded by the folklorist Miss R. A. Courtney in her 1886 book Cornish Feasts andFolklore. As told to her by Rev. Lach-Szryma.The summit of the rock is reticulated with curious veins of elvan, about which a"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"quaint Cornish legend relates that the BUCCA-boo, or storm god of the oldCornish, once stole the fisherman's nets. Being pursued by Paul choir, who sangthe creed, he flew to the top of Paul Hill and thence over the coomb to Tolcarn,where he turned the nets to stone.In the Old Cornwall Journal (no. 3, 1926) Rev. G. H. Doble recounts: At Newlyn, nearPenzance, a spirit called ‘Bucka’ is believed to come down from Paul Hill, by ‘Bucka'spass’ and haunt the road to Penzance. Thus the legend of the Bucca enters in to thecannon of Cornish folklore. Another intriguing tale relating to the Bucca was collectedfrom a Mr Hennery Maddern of Penzance by W. Y. Evans Wentz, who travelled throughCornwall at the turn of the century gathering first-hand accounts of færy lore (TheFairy-faith in Celtic countries of 1911) in which he relates a strange story of a beingsaid to inhabit Tolcarn: The fairy of Tolcarn was in some way like Puck of the EnglishMidlands but this fairy or troll was supposed to date back to the time of the Phœnicians.He relates as to how he lived within the rock but sometimes he chose to make himselfvisible. He also added that if one pronounced the appropriate incantation whilst onTolcarn, he would appear in the form in which you existed in a former life: You onlyhad to name the period or age, and you could live your past life their in over again. Itwas said that he assisted in the building of Solomon's temple and came to these shoresin search of tin; he was sometimes called the wandering one or Odin the wanderer.With this epithet, one is put in mind of that archetypal wanderer beloved of the 3rdcentury Gnostics and contemporary Sabbatic witches alike – Cain, who is described inthe old Cornish creation plays (The Creation of the World, William Jordan, 1611, theearliest reference to the Bucca recorded) as Bucca Nos, Bucca of the Night. Maddernalso adds that one could call him up by standing on the carn with three dried leaves ofoak, ash and thorn in your hand whilst speaking the appropriate incantation. The charmcould only be passed on contrasexually and to a believer. The informant however was asceptic so sadly never learned the incantation.This is a classic example of a legend directly relating to a feature in the landscape, atheme that betrays an ancient origin. Tales recounting the mythical creation of the landare far more than just idle entertainment, or even a means of explaining a naturalfeature. From the dreamtime myths of the Australian aboriginal song lines to theDindsenchas of the Celts, they are an embodiment of our relationship with the soul ofthe land. Their form changing over time; giants becoming saints, kings and devils, buttheir essence remains the same. Two notable features appear upon Tolcarn. Firstly theBucca's footprint. This is a common mythological motif; others appear at the Devil'sdoorway cave at Polperro (near to the evocatively named Polbucky – Bucca's pool), onTintagel castle or on the Giant's rock adjacent to the Boscawen-un stone circle forexample. The mythopoeic significance of this could relate to the mark signifying the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"presence of, or ownership by, a spiritual entity. One must not forget the significance ofsuch markings in relation to rituals of kingship or initiation. Secondly the veins ofquartz in the blue elvan rock are of notable significance (the Net-Of-Bucca is one of hismost profound mysteries). The beauty of such a feature can be quite breathtaking. Ihave seen that same glowing web of crystal etched into the beach pebbles below thecliffs of the Helford overlooking the haunt of the sea beast Morgawr, and at a naturalserpent altar in a cave on the beach on the north coast of Cornwall below the broodinghill of Buccator, and upon the great standing stone of Men Gurta on St. Breock's Down... a lightning flash frozen in stone – like the merry maidens who danced on the Sabbath.Evans Wentz described Tolcarn thus: This is a natural outcropping of greenstone ona commanding hill just above the vicarage in Newlyn, and concerning it many weirdlegends survive. In pre-Christian times it was probably one of the Cornish sacred spotsfor the celebration of ancient rites – probably in honour of the sun – and for divination.Some years past, when I first went in search of the sacred shrine of Tolcarn, I recallbeing at something of a loss. All I had to go on was an obscure 100 year old folkloricreference. After finding the likely location on the edge of Newlyn I noticed, hiddenbehind a row of houses, a huge and imposing inland cliff. Seeing someone in the gardenI politely enquired as to whether they had heard of Tolcarn or the said hoof print. I wasmet with taciturn and hostile response. I was put in mind of an account of the frostyreception surrealist, folklorist and occultist Ithell Colquhoun (who had once lived innearby Lamorna) received when looking for a holy well near Germoe. She explains:Country people are sometimes ashamed of having forgotten or neglected their holyplaces. I rather feel, though, that their reluctance is due to diffidence in showing themto a stranger, who may not sympathise with the agelong cult. A request to have a closerlook at the end of their garden however magically broke her amnesia and she directed usto a road at the top of the cliff. Dutifully we climbed the hill to a small housing estate.There between two garden fences I found a narrow entrance leading in the direction ofthe top of the cliff. I picked my way through the garden waste and brambles and in thepath before me saw a flat slab bearing a distinctly phallic form. As to whether this wasof human art or a simulacra of nature it was impossible to tell. (I have seen a similarimage to this, but in negative on the cliffs above Boscastle.). Stepping beyond the slabthe alley opened out to a numinous elvan crag high above the valley. There I stood likethe Bucca in this lost acre bathed in the Virtue of the dreamtime, whilst only a fewyards away families cooked, cleaned and watched the television in a suburban worldwhich could have been a thousand miles away.This tantalising tale begs the question ... who indeed is the Bucca? Robert Hunt in histaxonomy of the world of faery defines Buccas as being cognate with the Knockers, thesubterranean spirits haunting the old tin mines. This interpretation of the Buccas asbeing one of the faery tribes is a thread which continues throughout Cornish folklore. Inthe Museum of Witchcraft in Boscastle an inscription on the wall quotes Katherine"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Briggs’ Dictionary of Faeries and describes them as: Goblins of the wind who foretoldshipwrecks. Looking at the legend of Tolcarn one cannot help but feel that thisidentification of the Bucca with some kind of faery or non-individuated nature spirit ison the wrong track. Possibly this is an example of de-deification. The gods of the oldreligion can become the ghosts and demons of the new. As Arthur Machen states: TheFairies are the gods of the heathen come down in to the world: Diana becomes Titania;or as Rudyard Kipling in Puck of Pooks Hill (1906) put it: First they were the gods, thenthey were the people of the hills, and then they flitted to other places because theycouldn't get on with the English for one reason or another!William Bottrell, however, sees the Bucca of a very different mythological lineage tothat of Hunt; he quotes from an article in the journal ‘One and All’ (1868): ‘Bucca’ wasonce a divinity, but, being older than English Christianity, it became degraded from thathigh rank as the new religion came westwards. Nevertheless the Bucca did not die.Within easy memory every boat in Newlyn always set aside a portion of its catch, andleft it in a collected heap on the beach to propitiate the Bucca; and every fishermannoted, with superstitious awe, the remarkable regularity with which ‘Bucca’ fetchedaway his offerings, after dark. The writer then goes on to describe as to how the term‘Bucca’ was once used as a term of pride to denote an inhabitant of Newlyn, but as withthe deity to which the name pertains, it has degenerated into a form of derision. He alsogoes on to describe how to denote the supreme deity the term Deus is used amongst theLatins and Gott amongst the Teutons, whereas it is Bog (from which ‘Bucca’ Bogy,Puck, Pwka etc. Is derived) is only used amongst the Slavs; these last manifestations ofthe divine: having fallen amongst Teutonic thieves, were robbed of their divinity andcast adrift as disreputable devils. This seems to be leading us to look at the Bucca asbeing a quite distinct entity in his own right. In an intriguing pamphlet by Cornishfolklorist Charles Thomas (The Taboo, 1951) also puts forward the hypothesis that: TheSea has always been regarded under the protection of its own deities – Poseidon,Neptune, Dagon and all the fishlike anthropomorphic sea-gods. Therefore one musthave been present in a seafaring nation like Cornwall.There is ample evidence to suggest that on the western shores of Mounts Bay hewas known as the Bucca. This god or sprite (properly speaking there is only oneBucca) can be equated with Puck, Brownie or Robin Goodfellow of English folklore... at Newlyn, Bucca has been transferred to the sea. He was controller of thefishes, and three fishes would be thrown in to the harbour, or left on the beach forhim to ensure a plentiful catch. He is Bucca-Gwidn, the good spirit as opposed toBuccaboo, or Bucca-dhu, the storm god who stole fisherman's nets and raised thewind and whose name still survives in the name for a scarecrow. The bucca ofNewlyn was a benevolent god."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"He recalls the tradition that was said that if the sea was moaning it was the Buccacalling for rain, suggesting that the Bucca presided not only over the catch but also overthe weather. He speculates that a kind of dual faith observance grew up amongst thefisher folk, Bucca on weekdays and God on Sunday ... the Newlyn fishermen wouldnever fish on Sunday.One cannot help but think that the Tom Bawcock festival held in Mousehole inbetween Christmas and the Winter Solstice, in which torchlight processions in thestreets celebrate the mythical Tom Bawcock, who saved the village from famine bybraving the storm and returning with seven sorts of fish, is possibly a relic of the rites ofveneration to the old Bucca ... and when Cecil Williamson described the old Cornishwitches on the sea cliffs ecstatically dancing with the wind ... maybe it was old Buccawith whom they danced. From these tales it is clear that the old Bucca has two faces:Bucca-Gwidn, the white bucca, the bringer of peace and plenty; and Bucca-Dhu, theblack Bucca, the storm that flattens crops and smashes ships and houses. Like the sea,the one can transform into the other in an instant, but the irony is that it is the darknessof the storm that turns the wheel of the seasons and brings fertility to the land and sea.As sure as day follows night, so Bucca-Gwidn emerges from Bucca-Dhu and onlythrough Bucca-Dhu may Bucca-Gwidn be known.Let us for a moment look at the derivation of Bucca and return to Evans Wentz:Bucca, who properly is but one, is a deity and not a fairy, and it is said that atNewlyn, the great seat of his worship, offerings of fish are left out on the beach forhim. His name is the Welsh Pwca, which is probably ‘Puck,’ though Shakespeare'sPuck was just a Pisky, and it may be connected with the general Slavonic word‘Bog,’ God; so that if, as some say, Buccaboo is really meant for Bucca-dhu, blackbucca, this may be an equivalent of Czernbog, the black God, who was the Ahrimanof Slavonic dualism, and Bucca-Widn (White Bucca) which is rarer , though theexpression does come in to a St Levan story, may be the corresponding ‘Bielobog.’Nigel Jackson (Masks of Misrule, 1996) expands upon the etymology of the name:The Indo-European word BHUG denotes a horned beast, goat, ram, stag and inancestor of the modern English ‘Buck.’ From this root word are derived terms:Sanskrit ‘Bukka’ – ‘He goat.’ Anglo-Saxon ‘Bucca’ – ‘He goat’, Middle HighGerman ‘Bock’ – ‘Goat,’ Gaelic ‘Boc’ – ‘Goat,’ Icelandic ‘Bukkr’ and Latin‘Boquena’ – ‘Goatskin.’And of course one must not forget the Cornish dialect word bucca meaning scarecrow,fool, ghost or goblin.Charles Thomas suggests that the name Bucca may be just an epithet, or as the Saxons"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"called it a kenning. That is to say, the actual name of the deity is taboo, and cannot bespoken in the ordinary way, thus a descriptive title (which may equally obscure orelucidate the nature of the being to which it pertains) is used in its place. This themeemerges in the tale of Duffy and the Devil in which the Bucca rears his head in adifferent guise. The tale is a kind of Cornish Rumplestiltskin story in which theprotagonist has to guess the name of the shadowy Devil figure. One also suspects that itis the Bucca who emerges in the tale of St. Mawes (The old Cornish saint stories being arich reliquary of folkloric material). The story goes that one day the pious St. Maweswas preaching on a rocky promontory looking out to sea at the mouth of the Carrickroads. The seals however, having no appreciation of the word of god just continued tobark and call to one another across the waves. Such was the good saint's anger at thisunwanted distraction that he picked up a boulder and pitched it at the offending seals,thus scattering them and inadvertently forming the treacherous rock, known as BlackRock, that now lies at the mouth of the harbour. Canon G. H. Doble, in the 1920s,collected a Breton version of this tale in which the fiend disturbing the peace was not amere noisy seal, but was the demon and sea-monster horrible to behold Teus/Tuthe.This name appears to be related to the Gaulish/Celtic name Tutates which in turnappears to be a kenning applied to a number of Celtic Gods (In the same way that theterm Baal, or Lord, was used to denote a number of Near Eastern gods), but from itscontext, the finger points towards the Bucca. The stretch of sea where the action takesplace has been called Morgawr's mile, for it is the haunt of the mythical Cornish seamonster Morgawr (a name coined by surrealist Tony ‘Doc’ Sheils in the 1970s, meaningsea giant). Little is known of the monster except for a string of sightings dating back tothe turn of the last century, but like the pellar it seems to straddle the worlds. ‘Doc’Shiels famously embarked on a series of cryptozoological magical experiments with agroup of Pellar-witches around Mawnan woods in an attempt to conjure the beast; in theold tongue of the Cornish they chanted Morgawr cref yn nerth ef. With the Bucca'sblessing the beast arose from the depths and entered not only into our waters, but intoour consciousness once again. I too once saw Morgawr on a bright moonlight night inthe mid 1990s, when the Hale-Bop comet was high in the sky and the sea was as calm asa millpond. There she was, off Trefusis Point, heading from the old oil rig towards theshore ... but that is another story. One cannot, however, underestimate the profundity ofthe feeling one gets when one glances through the ‘gap in the hedge’ and for one briefmoment one touches the spirit world. It is moments like that which are known amongstthe Pellars as the Bucca's benediction.One must not forget that the realm of the Bucca is not entirely limited to the sea; theBucca is of a chthonic nature too. The spirits that inhabited the old mines were knownas knockers or the Buccas. The term knockers was used to describe the sound they madein order to warn the miners of impending danger or to guide them towards rich lodes,the name Bucca being more akin to a proper name. Their origin is said to be traced to"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"the Phonecians or the spirits of Jews sent to work in the mines in days gone by. One canonly assume that the term Bucca, however, suffered the same process below the groundas it did above ground and upon the shore. Did that same antediluvian god serve thedark recesses of the caves as he did upon the waves? The belief in the knockers in themines was by no means limited to the dim and distant past. Their presence continuedinto the 1980s until the last mine, South Crofty, was closed. Contemporary witnesseshave reported that areas of the mine had to be abandoned due to unwanted knockeractivity, and a votive cairn was still in use on one of the lower levels. In the tale of Tomand the Knackers collected by William Bottrell around St. Just he describes howprecarious our relationship with the spirits of the mines could be. Whilst working in thedepths of Ballowal mine he heard the spirits calling in the darkness, to which hediscourteously replied with a curse and a hand full of gravel. To which they replied withthe chant Tom Trevurrow! Tom Trevurrow! Leave some of thy fuggan for the Bucca orbad luck to thee tomorrow! requesting him to leave an offering of a morsel of his food,as was customary amongst the miners. Of course the curmudgeonly old Tom Trevurrowrefused and ill luck sure enough befell him.So too, it would seem, that the Bucca was also known in the fields. Charles Thomasin his 1952 pamphlet The Sacrifice in Cornwall suggests that the ubiquitous habit ofcountry folk leaving offerings of their produce to the Piskys is in fact directed towardsthe Bucca. The term Bucca was also used as a dialect term for Scarecrow. To the mindof an animist, the bundle of rags upon a wooden cross can become far more than just abird scarer, it becomes the spirit of the land itself. In many traditions, the witch and thehedge are synonymous, and so, here too the essence of the Bucca is made manifest.Bucca-Dhu is the hedge that ever seeks to encroach over the field and the Crow thatpecks away the newly sown seed, in an eternal quest to return the land to its primordialstate. Whilst Bucca-Gwidn is the Hedge cutter and the scarecrow, turning around thedarkness of the land that it may feed our bellies. In his paper, Charles Thomas connectsthe Bucca to the enigmatic scattering of small uncultivated areas of land often presentamidst cultivated farmland known as No man's land, Jack's land or the Devil's acre.These lost acres, often enclosing prehistoric features, are left as a refuge for the spiritsand the old gods. He recounts a tale told by John Harris of Camborne in 1825 in whichas a child he became lost in the fields. This phenomenon of being unaccountablydisoriented and lost in a small and familiar piece of land was known as being Pisky-ledor Pisky-laden. In the parish of Constantine in the early 1990s, I was in all earnestnesswarned of this, and I did indeed subsequently fall victim to it! Anyway, back to thestory – the young boy Harris eventually returned home, sobbing: there is nobody herebut I and the BUCKAW.The Bucca seems to exist on many levels. Far from being only an embodiment of thelandscape, he lives just as comfortably within the sphere of human life. In his guise asan intermediary between the worlds he can be Mercurial in aspect. A cycle of stories"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"collected by Bottrell from the St. Just area describe him as a trickster, somewhatreminiscent of Mullah Nasrudin of the Sufi tales, the divine fool, shifting ourconsciousness by turning the world on its head. One story relates that one day Buccastrolled into a tavern in St. Just, and there sitting in the window seat sat two gentlemen.Looking at the slovenly Bucca standing there rough as the hair on a badger's arse, theyexclaimed: Which art thee, Bucca, a fool or a rogue? As quick as a flash, he seatedhimself between the two and replied: I'm between both, I believe! From this retort isderived the expression Between both, as the Bucca said, and this expression, like theSufi tales, may be read on many different levels.As his goat-like name suggests, the Bucca can sweep from the Mercurial to the realmof the Saturnian. But however, as Bottrell observes:In a great number of our legends, the devil is a prominent personage; yet themythical demon of ‘Bucca-Boo’ of our drolls has few of the malicious traits of oursatanic Majesty.Like Bucca the trickster, Bucca the Devil changes our consciousness, but in a differentway. He comes to us as an initiator. In a cycle of tales entitled the Legends of Ladock,Bottrell tells the tale of John Trevail the prize wrestler of the parish. Wrestling is awell-respected traditional Cornish sport, tracing its pedigree back to the mythical fightbetween Brutus's commander Coreneus and the old giant Watcher-king Gogmagog,which resulted in the Celtic occupation of Cornwall. The protagonist, also known asCousin Jacky, one midsummer day, in a fine bout, threw the neighbouring parish'schampion. In a fit of rash pride he announced that he wouldn't mind having a hitch withthe devil himself, if he would venture. Sure enough, on his way home across the heath, inthe dead of night, he was approached by the Old One himself in the guise of a man ofthe cloth who offered to try a bout with him the following midnight. Jacky accepted andthe stranger was gone. In the cold light of day realising what he had done he approachedthe Rev. Wood, the rector of Ladock Parish, who was well versed in the magical arts.Under the good reverend's tutelage young Jacky was furnished with a magical charm,with which, after a fierce bout, he managed to overcome his otherworldly opponent,emerging as a wiser and more worldly fellow. In another story collected by Bottrellentitled Uter Bosence and the Pisky he relates another initiatory tale of a wrestler calledUter Bosence returning home from a Midsummer Day of wrestling and revelry in St.Just. Midsummer Day was not only a traditional fair day, but it was said that this wasthe time the Cornish witches gathered upon the moors, lit their ceremonial fires andrenewed their vows to the Old One. In this tale he inadvertently encroaches upon onesuch taboo time and place. He found himself in an old ruined chapel near Botrea. Beforehe knew it he was amidst a morass of serpent headed beings and was caught up in a wildfrenzied dance, then as he tried to get away, before him stood a being much like a black"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"buck goat, with horns and beard more than a yard in length; but the goat was of such asize, with such flaming balls of eyes and such a length of tale behind, was never seen onhills and mores before. The creature grasped Uter with its great hairy hands it had inplace of hooves. In a panic Uter took a swing at the great black Bucca with hisblackthorn staff, to find himself pitched up in the air, spinning over the valley and leftfor dead on a rock at the foot of Beacon Hill. He eventually recovered and from thatmoment forth, rather than continually attempting to prove himself: He paid moreattention to his farm and family; so perhaps the rolling did him good, on the whole. Asin many cultures, martial arts, dance, labour and spiritual practice are all inextricablyentwined. So as Jacob wrestled with the angel, so must the Pellar wrestle with theBucca. There are three things that will allow the Pellar to prevail, that is, hard training,magic and fair play, and when the struggle is done they must learn to walk away or becaught in a cycle of eternal conflict.Another tale we have already touched upon is Duffy and the Devil, in which the Buccaappears again in the guise of the Devil. There he appears as the lord of the Sabbatamidst a circle of dancing witches within a cavern at the head of Lamorna Valley. In aceremony of ritually revealing his name the witches chant: By night and day, we willdance and play, with our noble captain – Tarraway! Tarraway! (Taran being theCornish for thunder, thus linking him to Bucca the storm god.). Charles Thomassuggests:The earth Goddess was displaced by a male hunting-and-woodlands deity, whoseems to have been connected with witchcraft rather than agriculture. This entity –Dr. Murray's god of the witches – has had many names, but in Cornwall he stillclings tenuously to the soubriquet of Bucca.Let us not however fall into the trap of over-anthropomorphisation. The Bucca is farmore than just a god of agriculture and fishing, or even a mysterious folkloric Devil.The Bucca is an embodiment of the primordial forces of the land and the sea; anexposure to the storm, a rending of the soul. Arthur Machen in The Great God Pan(1894) describes the experience of encountering such a being:There is a real world, but it is beyond this glamour and this vision, beyond thesechases in Arras, dreams in a career, beyond them all as beyond a veil. You mayfind this all strange nonsense; it may be strange but it is true, and the ancientsknew what lifting the veil means. They called it seeing the god Pan.It is from the word Pan that the word panic is derived, so in this sense Bucca is cognatewith Pan in that he is not so much an entity but a state of being. The Bucca isexperienced not through reason, but through the sense of the numinous, that is to say,the direct super-sensory experience of the divine made manifest within the realm of"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"nature. This however is not just an inward experience of the mind. Mystic and SurrealistIthell Colquhoun, whilst living in Paul (Bucca's heartland), described this experience asthat which brings forth:A ‘fountain of Hecate,’ an uprush of force from a macro-cosmic underworld whichfocused by ceremony may coincide at precise times with the microcosmicunconscious.There is a Cornish dialect word – mazed – which on one level can mean intoxicated, buton another can mean being carried away by a consciousness-altering ecstasy of thespirit. This is the true mystery of Neptune, immersion in the seas of our subconscious,and in the soul of the world.Another writer well versed in the magical arts, Dion Fortune in The Goat Foot God(1936), describes how her protagonist develops a magical relationship with thelandscape in order to invoke the wild pagan forces of Pan. The paradox is that once Panis made manifest:It was not the Goat-god, crude and earthy. It was the sun! But not the sun ofsophisticated Apollo, but an older earlier primordial sun, the sun of Helios theTitan.Once again Bucca-Dhu is transformed into Bucca-Gwidn. Although these are bothfictional accounts, the work of both Machen and Fortune are firmly based in actualmagical knowledge and experience. To the Pellar, the gnosis of the Bucca, far frombeing destructive, is an awakening of the soul to its true divine nature, as Plato's prayerto Pan in Phaedrus tells us: Beloved Pan, and ye other gods who haunt this place, giveme beauty in my inward soul, and may the outward and inward man be one. Severalyears ago I delivered a folklore lecture in West Cornwall in which I had touched uponthe subject of place names connected with the Bucca. I had mentioned Chybucca, nearTruro, which had commonly interpreted as meaning haunted house. Afterwards I wasapproached by a wily old Cornishman who insisted that it meant house of the spirit. Hewent on to explain: and that's what we are... A house of the spirit ... and that's what wecan become.So this indeed begs the question, where would a multi-faceted deity who brings forthboth fish for our bellies and rapture for the soul hale from? The gnostic element of theBucca in addition to his elemental, magical, tutelary, metallurgical, nautical andfertility aspects suggest that rather than being of a purely singular and indigenous origin(a Cornish version of Manannan mac lyr of the Gael or Wade of the northern folk) he isindeed of a syncretic nature and of a composite origin. Cornwall has never been anisolated land, since prehistory it has always been a seafaring nation. There has been apersistent belief in Cornwall that the Phoenecians once came to our shores in search of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"tin. The Phoenecians were a seafaring people who ruled the sea-roads of theMediterranean from the second millennium BCE to the end of the last Punic war in the5th century BCE. Their culture was a melting pot of the Near-Eastern, Egyptian and theClassical worlds. We have already looked at two direct references to the Phoenecians inrelation to the Bucca. Cecil Williamson (the old proprietor of the Museum ofWitchcraft in Boscastle Cornwall 1909–1999) spoke of a tradition he knew of that toldof the Troy People, whom he describes as the wandering ‘Charmers’ of theMediterranean seaboard, who he claims settled in the South-West of Britainestablishing a Phoenecian cult of Tannit. The Phoenecians were in the habit ofestablishing a composite tutelary deity in the places they settled, composed of a fusionof the local god's and their own. These were given the epithet Ba'al (meaning Lord) plusthe local gods name. It is interesting to note that many near-Eastern tongues have nophonetic p, so it is often replaced with b. An example of this within the Phoenecianhomeland on the Syrian-Israeli border is the spring dedicated to Pan, which has mutatedfrom Panyas to Banyas, thus in the same way the Pucka of the Britain's could mutate toBucca. As to the question of who is the most likely candidate for the Bucca's ancestor,the Phoenecian god Kusor seems to loom out of the mist. In the first century, in histreatise on the mythology of the Phoenecians, Philo relates:Kusor practiced the arts of magical formulas, incantation and divination ... heinvented the fish-hook and bait, the fishing line and the fishing boat, and he wasthe first to learn how to navigate.Earlier legends describe him as the originator of smithcraft, the controller of the rainsand the turner of the seasons. Is this not an almost perfect description of the Bucca'sareas of jurisdiction?Again I think it is misleading to think of a folkloric phenomenon as having a pristineoriginal (and by implication correct) form that existed at some indeterminate point inthe past, which has been periodically ‘polluted’ as it travels down through time. Ourconcept of the gods is in no way separate to any other cultural phenomenon. It issyncretic and dynamic, growing and changing all the time. And so too does the Bucca ashe strides down through history, like the serpent shedding his skin each time he is calledforth from the sea. From God of the seas, to Pisky, Devil and scarecrow, and now withinthe modern ‘Traditional Craft’ revival the Bucca has emerged once again.In an underground form, the Cunning magical traditions seem to have survived intothe 20th century. In the 1950s there emerged a popular revival of Witchcraft instigatedby Gerald Gardner (1884‒1964). For a while, on the Isle of Man, he and CecilWilliamson resided together, sharing a dream of founding a Witchcraft Museum.Gardner's interest however was in creating a mass popular pagan religion; its adherenceto any traditional forms of magic was of secondary importance to its utility, whereas"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Cecil Williamson devoted his life to studying and practicing the lore of the traditionalwitch. Gardner with his populist Wicca entered the popular consciousness, whilstWilliamson faded into obscurity. Meanwhile, in a strange twist of fate Wicca becamethe prevailing paradigm and the old craft was pushed even further into the shadows.Robert Cochrane (whom we have already visited) was one of the few voices ofdissention, but on his passing, his own tradition (under the guise of the Regency Covenand the work of Doreen Valiente) cross-pollinated with Wicca and the two becamevirtually indistinguishable.The first stirrings of interest in the indigenous magic of Cornwall came from theFolklore camp; with William Paynter, Charles Thomas and B. C. Spooner and of courseCecil Williamson, who had arrived in Cornwall in the 1950s and there quietly practicedand researched the ways of the old Cornish Crafter in the Museum of Witchcraft untilhis death. Apart from Williamson, surprisingly it was from the surrealist art camp thatthe first wave of the revival of the actual practice of traditional Cornish methods ofmagic emerged with Ithell Colquhoun, Peter Redgrove and Tony ‘Doc’ Sheils. All thisemerged against a backdrop of a growing interest in Celticism and Romanticism and‘Earth mysteries’ in Cornwall. It was not however until the 1990s that a revival of awider interest in the ‘old Craft’ seemed to really get under way. Nigel Jackson, MikeHoward and Nigel Pennick emerged with a vision of a reformed old Craft, but it wasAndrew D. Chumbley, Essex cunningman and Magister of the Cultus Sabbati (1967‒2004) who set the template for the Traditional Craft revival. In a sense he did for theOld Craft what Gardner had done for Wicca, only rather than establish a homogeneousuniversal system, he was passionate about the reification and enfleshment of theregional manifestations of the traditional craft – in all their idiosyncratic glory! It wasto this end that he devoted the final years of his life. He envisioned, in the West, arevival of the Pellar cult under the tutelage of the Bucca. On one of his many visits toCornwall he spoke this charm: Come Bucca Come, noble Captain of our Sabbath, Come forth our good and faithful king. Come dancing over the mound to stand upon the stone of truth, Here to plant the tree of Bucca; the goat horned stang of Pellar. About this same time Oxford based occultist Jack Daw (Paul Ratcliffe) was envisioninghis own re-emergent form of the Pellar Craft, which he in turn had inherited from hisDevonshire grandmother. He disseminated a list of aphorisms, terminology, spellrecipes and the following prayer:Horned Bucca, both dark and fair, divine androgyny, be in all hearts and on the tipof every tongue. For your time has come again as it does with the beginning of"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"every moment.With the revival of the Midsummer festivity of Golowan/Mazey day and the Midwinterfestival of Montol in Penzance, the Bucca (under the guidance of Cassandra Latham theVillage Witch of St. Buryan) has become a key part of the town procession. The Buccabecame the Teaser that guides the Penglaze (the horseskull-bearing Hobby Horse thatappears as a key focus of the processions) in an eternal dance of death and resurrection.It is from this image that within the neo-Pellar revival, that the horses skull has becomesynonymous with the Bucca. History relates that when the Spanish raided Mounts Bayin the 16th century they claim to have found a horse-headed idol in Paul church. Theline from the Indian Upanishads, the horse's head is the gate of god, is brought to mind,or the verse from the Rig Veda:The horse has come to the slaughter, pondering with his heart turned towards theGods, the goat (Bukka), his kin, is led in front; behind come the poets, the singers.In 2008 Gemma Gary produced Traditional Witchcraft: A Cornish Book of Ways.Drawing from Jack Daw, Jackson, Williamson and her own Craft experiences, shecreated a complete cycle of Pellar praxis under the auspices of the Bucca. Thus theBucca enters into the cannon of the modern traditional magic revival.Of course the internet has spawned a plethora of folks peddling their own vision ofthe traditional Cornish Craft. Most of which is at best derivative and at worst a show offancy dress, adolescent images of blood and skulls and other foppish neo-gothicexcesses. But the Bucca still lives on, in the howl of the wind and the crashing of thewaves. It is here the Bucca is to be found, in the stories in our hearts and the labyrinthsof the land. With the emergence of the great orb of Neptune into our groupconsciousness in the mid 19th century, there came a re-emergence of the Mysteries inthe form of the Pellar cult and a re-remembering of the Bucca that once blessed ourshores. But still there are those who would say that the Bucca is but a fancy picturewoven from the warp of folklore and the weft of the romantic imagination. All I cansuggest is that you go to the shoreline at twilight and call three times to the wavesBUCCA! BUCCA! BUCCA! Then walk away and don't look over your shoulder tilldawn, and there you will find your answer. To this very day rumours persist of a Buccacult in the woods and fields of West Penwith, the valleys and moors of CentralCornwall, in the estuaries and the old disused granite quarries of West Cornwall and onthe rocky crags of the north Cornish coast.

The Authoris currently working on a book on Mr Williamson incorporating much unpublished magical material.CHUMBLEY, ANDREW: His work with the regional witchcraft traditions was very much a work in progress, which was sadly cut short by his untimelypassing. Consequently nothing was published directly relating to this, but many of the ideas inherent in it are implicit in his earlier work, but also I feelthat paradoxically it also made much of his earlier work redundant."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Exorcists, Conjurors and Cunning Men in Post Reformation EnglandHAT ARE THE LINKS BETWEEN the Medieval Minor Clerical Order of Exorcistand the cunning men or conjurors of later centuries? This is one of themissing pieces of cunning craft history, and as such is written from anEnglish perspective and with particular reference to the county ofLancashire. There is a demonstrable continuity of practice from the church sanctionedprofessional exorcists to the profusion of freelance quack doctors, cunning folk andexpellers. We will also witness the creation of the Witch bottle, the breaking of ahangman's rope, authentic rituals of exorcism and sundry other marvels in our tale.To the medieval European mind the Universe was created by God. Everything inHeaven and Earth was ordained by God and every event from the Creation to the Lastjudgement was pre-destined. In such a universe nothing simply happened, every eventhad a place and purpose.The universe was envisaged as being essentially Aristotelian or geocentric incharacter. In other words the Earth sat at the centre of a neatly stacked series ofconcentric spheres. This model of the universe comes down to us in the form describedby the celebrated astronomer Claudius Ptolemæus in the 2nd century CE. Besides theearthly sphere there were seven ascending planetary spheres each containing one of theplanetary bodies, an eighth containing the fixed stars and a ninth containing the mind ofGod. The planetary spheres were the Moon which was closest to the Earth followed byMercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.Students of the Qabala will recognise that this arrangement corresponds with theSephiroth on the Qabalistic tree of life and with the Platonic and Mithraic planetaryladder to enlightenment. This concept is seen in its most elaborate form in DanteAlighieri's visions of seven heavens expanding outwards from the Earth and the ninecircles of hell descending down into the Earth's core."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Linked to the geocentric worldview was the concept of a great Chain of Being.According to the Chain of Being all created things could be ranked in a hierarchyaccording to their level of development. Living beings could be ranked in the followingway: God/Angels/Saints/Clean Souls/the good Longævi* – Humans/Animals/Plants –the wicked Longævi – Unclean Souls/Demons/Fallen Angels – the Devil.According to this theory humans were the only living creatures in the Chain of Beingwho could ascend to heaven. This was because God had breathed his Holy Word (orbreath) into the clay from which Adam was made, giving to him and his heirs a soulderived from God.Aristotle saw the sphere of the Moon as lying between the material and spiritualworlds: Aristotle made a sharp distinction between the world above and below themoon. In the ethereal region above, celestial laws hold, while below earthly bodies aresubject to mutability, the force of time. All matter seeks its proper place in the divinehierarchy: heavy bodies fall; light bodies rise.†This separation could be seen throughout the created world. Within man himselfthere was a separation between the higher spiritual nature and the lower animal natureruled by carnal appetites. The same division of the chain of being was envisaged withinhuman society. The King was placed at the apex, below him were the Clergy; theprinces; the nobility and gentry; the craftsmen, burgesses and yeomen farmers; andlowest of all the un-free peasants or villeins.The same hierarchy could be found in the ecclesiastical structure in each feudalterritory. The church hierarchy incorporated nine ascending orders or grades splitbetween the three major holy orders and the five minor holy orders. The major holyorders are still familiar to all Christians and comprise the originally celibate orders ofDeacon, Priest and Bishop with the Primate (senior Bishop) at the top of the pyramid.The minor orders are now much less familiar. In all but the Eastern Churches the MinorHoly Orders (Ordines Minores) have long since been abolished or converted into layoffices, or grades for Priests in training.The situation was quite different during the Middle Ages. Each of the five minororders had a clear and important function within the Parish. Members of the minororders carried out most of the routine and administrative work within Parishes.Membership of the minor orders was by admission rather than ordination and wasusually granted in person by the local Ordinary, generally a Bishop but sometimes anexempt Abbot and, occasionally a lesser Prelate.Minor orders were conferred by the presentation to the candidate of the appropriateinstruments, a key for a Door Keeper; a lectionary for a Lector; the book of exorcismfor the Exorcist; and a candlestick for an Acolyte. Members of the minor orders werenot required to be celibate and most lived normal married lives. Surprisingly manymembers of the minor orders became the Rectors of Parishes, but being unable to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"celebrate the Mass would retain a poor Priest to perform the Holy Office or ‘Serve theCure’ as it was known on their behalf. Such poor Priests hired on an annual stipend wereknown as perpetual curates and performed Mass where the Rector was either absent or aman in minor orders. In other cases a tenured deputy with the right to collect the lessertithe was appointed; these were known as Vicars (from vicarius, a deputy or lieutenant).This situation although frowned upon officially became so commonplace in many ruralareas of England as to become unremarkable despite many attempts to eradicate thepractice. There are two celebrated instances of hereditary clerical offices in Lancashire;these are the Rectors of Standish and the Deans of Whalley. In parts of Ireland andScotland the occupation of church offices on an hereditary basis became almost thenorm and a whole class of churchmen known as Erenachs developed who though havingreceived only the first tonsure were both clan chiefs and lay abbots. The first grade ofthe minor orders – though strictly speaking not an order – was the first tonsure.The first tonsure, although it was reckoned to confer upon its recipient clerklystatus (Ordo Clericalis) and the duty of singing in church, was not regarded as anorder or as a sacrament itself, but merely as a pious intention [...] The tonsuremade a boy or man a clerk, but it separated him from the lay world only by apresumed mental state of intention.*This was simply an undertaking to follow a religious life within the church. The firsttonsure distinguished a cleric from a layman and entitled a man to the benefit of clergy.Benefit of clergy exempted one from the jurisdiction of secular courts includingcriminal courts. Admission to the clergy could be abused in order to avoid criminalprosecution. Prosecutions could still be brought in church courts, but church courts hada reputation for their leniency towards clerics.The first true minor order was that of Doorkeeper (Ostiarius or Custos). TheDoorkeeper was the keeper of the church keys and was responsible for the maintenanceof the fabric of the church and the church grounds. They supervised the burial of thedead and were responsible for the church plate, vestments and any relics the churchpossessed. In England after the Reformation most of the functions of the Doorkeeperwere divided between the lay offices of verger and sexton (formerly Sacristan orCustos).The second minor order was that of Lector or reader. The main responsibility of theLector was to read the lesson in church. Though being necessarily literate they couldalso be used for a wide range of administrative duties. In the Church of England (orWorld Wide Anglican Communion) Lectors have been replaced by lay readers. Lectorswere frequently also the Parish Clerk.The third minor order was the Exorcist. As their title implies the main functions ofthe Exorcist were exorcism and the care and welfare of those possessed by demons."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The seventh canon of the fourth Council of Carthage in 398 CE describes the ritual bywhich the minor order of Exorcist was conferred: The bishop is to give him the bookcontaining the formulæ of exorcism, saying, ‘Receive, and commit to memory, andpossess the power of imposing hands on energumens (demoniacs), whether baptized orcatechumens (people receiving teaching prior to baptism).’The minor order of Exorcist was abolished at the time of the Reformation and unlike theother orders was not replaced by a lay office. Exorcism is still carried out by AnglicanPriests in the present day, but the wider functions of the Exorcist effectively ceased tobe carried out in England from the time of the Reformation in the 16th century.The final minor order was the Acolyte, an altar server and assistant to the Priestperforming the Mass. This office though no longer an order is still performed by laypeople within Anglican Parishes.From the earliest times until as recently as the 18th century a wide variety of diseaseswere believed to be the result of possession by fairies, spirits and demons or caused byelf-shot. Such diseases included fevers, ague or the quakes, worms, frenzy, seizures,stroke and many forms of mental illness including schizophrenia and dementia. It waswidely believed that in deserted places elves would shoot invisible arrows at people andanimals causing fever, lethargy, wasting or madness. The only cure for such conditionswas believed to be the expulsion of the disease-causing agent be it dart, unclean spirit orinfernal worm.In early modern England both ordinary and learned people believed that certainkinds of illness might be the result of maleficium (harmful magic) or demonicpossession. While belief in witchcraft and demons may have declined somewhatduring the course of the seventeenth century, it remained acceptable to attributecertain forms of disease to the Devil, particularly certain types of mental illness.*Charles Singer in his British Academy lecture on Early English Magic and Medicinestates that:A large amount of disease was attributed ... to the action of supernatural beings,elves, Æsir, smiths or witches whose shafts fired at the sufferer produced historments. Anglo-Saxon and even Middle English literature is replete with thenotion of disease caused by the arrows of mischievous supernatural beings. Thistheory of disease we shall, for brevity, speak of as the doctrine of the elf-shot. TheAnglo-Saxon tribes placed these malicious elves everywhere, but especially in thewild uncultivated wastes where they loved to shoot at the passer-by.†Beside their obvious and ostensible function of exorcism the Pre-Reformation Exorcistsprimary functions were to feed and care for demoniacs (those who are possessed), and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"to care for anyone afflicted by the wide range of diseases believed to be caused bysupernatural agencies. The Exorcist would additionally take on a veterinary role caringparticularly for cattle afflicted by murrain (an umbrella term for a range of diseasesincluding rinderpest, erysipelas, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, and streptococcusinfections). Sick people and animals would be brought to the church for treatment butthe Exorcist would also tour the outlying parts of the Parish to minister to the sick andpossessed. To our modern eyes the Exorcist in a rural Parish would combine at leastsome of the functions of a range of modern health professionals including mental healthnurse, counsellor, vet and general practitioner.Whilst exorcism was their main stock in trade they would also have used simpleherbal medicines and general nursing care to help their human and animal patients.Though we may dispute the efficacy of exorcism for some of the conditions treated, itsplacebo effect should not be underestimated. The healing effects of simple kindnesscombined with good food, safe fluids and hygiene are undoubted particularly whengiven to those members of society who, being feared, were often ostracised andneglected. In rural areas where the services of surgeons and physicians were eitherinaccessible or far too expensive for the majority of people, the Exorcist was a valuedmember of society. The abolition of the exorcist left a huge gap in rural society, a vitalfunction had been removed; in addition a large number of relatively educated andspecialist health professionals were now unemployed.The crossover between the clerical function of the Exorcist and sorcery becomesapparent when one considers the following example:In 1531, John Cousell, of Cambridge, and John Clarke, of Oxford, two learnedclerks (indicating membership of a minor order), applied for and obtained fromHenry VIII, a formal license to practise sorcery, and to build churches, a quaintcombination of evil and antidote. They professed power to summon ‘the sprytes ofthe ayre’ and to make use of them generally, and particularly in the discovery oftreasure and stolen property. The seventh petition is to build churches, bridges andchapels, and to have cognizance of all sciences. One of their petitions refers to a‘noyntment’ to see sprytes and to speak with them dayly. Strange that Henry VIIIshould have granted this license, seeing that a statute was passed in his reign,making ‘Witchcraft and sorcery felony without benefit of clergy.’*The methods used for exorcism in the Judeo-Christian cultures have changedsurprisingly little during the period covered by the historical record. The earliestcontemporary record of such an exorcism was recorded by Flavius Josephus in the 1stcentury CE: I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was Eleazar,releasing people that were demoniacal, in the presence of Vespasian and his sons andhis captains and the whole multitude of his soldiers. The manner of the cure was this:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"He put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrilsof the demoniac, after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when theman fell down, immediately he adjured him to return into him no more, still makingmention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed. And whenEleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that he had such a power, heset a little way off a cup or basin full of water, and commanded the demon, as he wentout of the man, to overturn it, and thereby let the spectators know that he had left theman; and when this was done the skill and wisdom of Solomon were shown verymanifestly.†This exorcism is very redolent of the Book of Solomon and will be familiar to anystudent of the Goetia. Verse five of the Testament of Solomon explains how KingSolomon also used a ring to compel the Demons to build the Temple of Jerusalem.Adjuring the demon to depart using words of power and the Names of God is a constantelement in all exorcisms. Compelling the demon to perform a task to prove it hascomplied is a less common element in exorcisms but recurs frequently.The Testament of Solomon, which is contemporary with or perhaps a little earlier thanJosephus, follows this theme.Now when I Solomon heard this, I entered the Temple of God, and prayed with allmy soul, night and day, that the demon might be delivered into my hands, and that Imight gain authority over him. And it came about through my prayer that gracewas given to me from the Lord Sabaoth by Michael his archangel. [He brought me]a little ring, having a seal consisting of an engraved stone, and said to me: ‘Take,O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the Lord God has sent thee, thehighest Sabaoth. With it thou shalt lock up all demons of the earth, male andfemale; and with their help thou shalt build up Jerusalem. [But] thou [must] wearthis seal of God. And this engraving of the seal of the ring sent thee is aPentalpha.’‡Modern Jewish exorcisms like this one described by Geoffrey Dennis contain the samefamiliar elements: Many possessing spirits are evidently quite forthcoming andloquacious. At times cooperation was coerced from the demon by ‘fumigation,’ exposingit to smoke and sulfur, a sympathetic invocation of the infernal realms (Igrot ha-Ramaz). The goal of the interview is to eventually learn the name of the evil spirit [...]The exorcist then uses the power of the demonic spirit's own name to ‘overpower’ it, byround after round of scripted ritual actions involving threats and rebukes, getting moreintense and invasive with each effort. A few ceremonies on record reached the point ofactually ‘beating’ the demon out, but most simply involved verbal coercion.Jewish exorcisms are usually ‘liturgical,’ using protective passages from the Psalmsand other sacred texts. Antidemonic Psalms have been found among the Dead Sea"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Scrolls, though whether they were used in actual exorcism is impossible to know [...]The primary sign of a successful exorcism was a bloody fingernail or toenail, the pointby which the dybbuk enters and leaves the body. Occasionally there are reports ofspirits violently leaving through the throat, vagina, or rectum. A sudden and dramaticchange in the victim's behavior is also a sure sign of recovery.§The Christian version of exorcism is clearly derived from now familiar Jewishmethodology. The early Christian theologian Origen recorded Christian exorcisms inthe 3rd century CE: that he saw people cured of dangerous diseases – of possession,madness, and other ills – simply by calling on the names of God and Jesus, and thatotherwise neither men nor demons could cure them. Christianity has preserved thisbelief up to the present day, for exorcism still forms a part of the rite of baptism.*The Roman Catholic and Anglican Rituals of Exorcism are essentially identical.Since the two faiths parted company in 1538 it is reasonable to assume that the ritual inits present form dates from before this. The original medieval version must have beenvery similar. There are three main exorcisms within the text, each progressively moreintense. The text itself is easy to obtain for those so inclined. I have included below aportion of the second exorcism just to provide a flavour of the ritual and to provide acomparison with the charms used for exorcism by the Cunning Men of later centuries.

Demoniacs were frequently taken to the shrines of major Saintswhere they were left overnight and sometimes for days or even weeks at a time in orderto affect a cure. Whilst at the shrine the demoniacs would be cared for by the residentExorcist(s). At major Cathedral shrines there would often be a large number ofExorcists under the authority of a shrine keeper or Feretrar such was the demand fortheir services.Demoniacs were tied up and taken to medieval shrines and kept there for days oreven weeks, until their rage subsided, though it was difficult to carry on the liturgywith much decorum during their screaming ‘fits.’ †When it was impractical to bring a demoniac to a local shrine a standard exorcismwould often be combined with the use of a portable Saint's Relic.Considering the condition of the demoniac, as it often excluded the taking of thevictim to the relics of a saint, the evil spirits were sometimes chased off withportable relics. The idea was to direct the demon out of the possessed body, which,as mentioned above, often turned into the scene of hunting the demon within thebody. The most common practice was to place the relics at the victim's head or"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"mouth, sometimes also in the mouth cavity.*The English Reformation began in the 1530s during the reign of King Henry VIII andmay be considered to have been completed by the 1560s early in the reign of QueenElizabeth I. The Reformation swept the minor orders away. Where they were consideredto be necessary the roles were secularised, but the exorcist's role was consideredunnecessary and was abolished altogether.In the more remote areas of England Exorcists had performed a vital social andmedical function and they would have been sorely missed. The population was nohealthier after the Reformation than before and belief that supernatural agencies were amajor cause of disease had in no sense diminished. In fact the bitter Civil War of 1642–51, and the outbreaks of plague which followed it, resulted in the death of perhaps aquarter of the population of England. The inevitable social disruption this causedresulted in outbreaks of hysteria and an upsurge in superstitious beliefs the like ofwhich had not been seen since the Early Middle Ages. The need for a professional to fillthe role previously fulfilled by the Exorcist was now greater than ever before.Many of the men who had formerly been Exorcists but now found themselvesunemployed took a natural course of action. They offered their skills to the public in thecapacity of private practitioners. In this way a new profession was born. Throughout therural areas of England former Exorcists and ex-monks set up business as privatepractitioners specialising in the expelling of unclean spirits and other forms of healing.One such man Thomas Pavil said: I have no other means left for my maintenance butto turn physician. And concluded mournfully: God knows how many men's lives it willcost.†One of the commonest names for such rustic medical practitioners was Quack Doctor.Others included Cunning Men and Conjuror from their ability to conjure spirits,Dispossessor and Dispeller from their ability to exorcise the disease-causing spirit. Thislast is one possible explanation for the name of one form of Cornish cunning man orcunning woman, the Pellar. This point is however a matter of contention, particularlyamongst modern Cornish cunning men.One explanation for the name of Quack Doctor is given by Robert Means Lawrence,M.D: It has also been maintained that quack is a corruption of quake, and that quack-doctors were so called because, in marshy districts, patients affected with intermittentfever, sometimes vulgarly known as the quakes, were wont to be treated by ignorantpersons, who professed to charm away the disease, and hence were styled quake-doctors.‡Ague was the name given to the severe fevers prevalent in marshy districts and inLancashire: ‘Casting out the Devil’ was also known as ‘casting out the Ague,’ since hecaused his victims to shiver and shake.§"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"A celebrated example of the cunning men who began to practice in Lancashire duringthe reign of Queen Elizabeth I was Edmund Hartlay, a conjuror called in to dispossessthe children of Nicholas Starkie of Huntroyd who was living at Cleworth Hall in theparish of Leigh in 1594. A full account was set down in 1600 by William Darrell in ATrue Narration of the Strange and Grievous Vexation by the Devil of Seven Persons inLancashire, by John Darrell, Minister of the Word of God. This can be found in full inchapter VII of The Devil in Britain and America, by John Ashton, published in 1896 byWard and Downey.The children of Nicholas Starkie had been suffering from convulsions and Nicholasemployed physicians at the exorbitant fee of £200 (an enormous sum at the time when ayeoman might expect to earn £5 a year and a Lancashire gentleman perhaps £20)toaffect a cure. However no cure was forthcoming. At his wit's end, Nicholas Starkieemployed the conjuror Edmund Hartlay to dispossess his children of the evil spirits whotormented them. Edmund Hartlay was retained for a fee of £2 a year. Hartlay was ableto help the children; to achieve this he went with Nicholas Starkie to the Starkie's mainhouse at Huntroyd near Whalley in North Lancashire:On a certaine time Hartlay went with M. Starchie to his father's house in Whallyparishe, where he was tormented sore all night. The next day, beinge recouered, hewent into a little wood, not farr from the house, where he maide a circle about ayarde and halfe wyde, deviding it into 4 partes, making a crosse at euery Diuision;and when he had finished his worke, he came to M. Starchie, and desiered him togo and tread out the circle, saying I may not treade it out my selfe; and further, Iwill meete with them that went about my death.When M. Starchie saw this wreched dealing of his, and his children stillmolested, he waxed wearie of him, howbeit he sought other helpe for his children.Then he tooke his sonnes water to a phisitian in Manchester, who sawe no signe ofsicknes; after, he went to Doctor Dee, the warden of Manchester, whose helpe herequested, but he utterly refused, sayinge he would not meddle, and aduised himthat, settinge aside all other helpe, he should call for some godlye preachers, withwhom he should consult concerning a Publicke or Privat fast. He also procuredHartlay to come before him, whom he so sharply reproved, and straitly examined,that the children had more ease for 3 weekes space after; and this was upon the 8of December.After being rebuked by Dr Dee, Hartlay was enraged and embarked upon a campaign ofsorcery and harassment of the Starkie household which created pandemonium atCleworth Hall.But Hartlay withstood them, and, because they went to his house, notwithstandinghis prohibition, he told them, with an angri loke, that it had bene better for them"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"not to haue chaunged an old frend for a new, with other menacinge speaches, andso went before them in a rage, and neuer came neare them all the way home.Upon the Tuesday after new yeares day lanuarie 4. lohn Starchie was readinge,somethinge gave him such a blowe on the necke, that he was soddenlye strickendowne with an horrible scryke, saying that Satan had broken his necke and layetormented pitifully for the space of two howres. The same day, at night, being inbed, he lept out on the sudden, with a terrible outcry, that amased all the familye.Then was he tossed and tumbled a long tyme, was very feirce like a mad-man, or amad dogge, snacted at and bite euery one that he layde hold on, with his teethe, notspareing his mother, smiting the next, and hurling Bed-staues, Pillowes, orwhatsoeuer at them, and into the fire. From this day forwarde he had no great easeuntil the day of his deliverance.Eventually seven members of the Cleworth Hall household whom Hartlay had kissedand breathed the Devil into became possessed by evil spirits. The victims were hauntedby spectral black dogs and cats, taunted by unseen spirits who shouted at them, causingthem to bark like dogs and became the subjects of violent fits and seizures. In 1597Hartlay was examined and tried by the magistrates of Lancaster.At the assises at Lancaster, was Hartlay condemned and hanged. The making of hiscircle was chiefly his ouerthrowe, which he denyed; but breaking the rope, he,after, confessed it.Hartlay was sentenced to hang and in March 1597 and he was duly hanged outsideLancaster Castle. The rope broke but, undaunted, the hangman fetched another rope andfinished the job.This example shows how this new breed of cunning men could aid the afflicted; butalso demonstrates how easy it was for such a man to cross the line and use his skills forevil. It becomes apparent that a man capable of dispelling a spirit could just as easilyconjure evil spirits to do harm if he chose to.No longer under the authority of the Church, the conjurors could incorporate new andun-canonical methods into their practice. Apart from the more usual forms of exorcismto which we will return in the next section, one of the most widely used and persistenttools used by cunning men to counteract witches was the Witch bottle. One of the bestdescriptions of the use of a Witch bottle was set down by Joseph Blagrave in 1671.Joseph Blagrave, a 17th century polymath, was one of the closest friends of EliasAshmole and a brother of the Regicide Daniel Blagrave (one of the commissioners whosentenced King Charles I to death in 1649); he wrote on subjects as diverse as farmmanagement, astrology, medicine, herbs and alchemy. One of his most famous textswas the Astrological Practice of Physick in which he describes in detail the uses ofWitch bottles."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Here followeth some experimental Rules, whereby to afflict the Witch, causing theevil to return back upon them. Another way is to stop the urine of the Patient, closeup in a bottle, and put into it three nails, pins, or needles, with a little white Salt,keeping the urine always warm: if you let it remain long in the bottle it willendanger the witches life: for I have found by experience that they will begrievously tormented making their water with great difficulty, if any at all, andthemore if the Moon be in Scorpio in Square or Opposition to his Significator whenit's done [...] The reason why the Witch is tormented when the urine of the patientis burned, is because there is part of the vital spirit of the Witch in it, for such isthe subtlety of the Devil, that he will not suffer the Witch to infuse any poysonousmatter into the body of man or beast, without some of the Witches blood mingledwith it as appeareth by the whey mentioned. For ’tis the Devils policy either by thisway to detect them or otherwise by torment to bring them unto their ends. For thedevil well knoweth that when the blood or urine of the patient is burned, that thewitch will be afflicted, and then they will desire to come to the place, for to getease, for by the smell thereof, their pain is mitigated by sympathy, when the bloodor urine is burning, they are tormented, yet sometimes they will rather indure themisery of it than appear, by reason country people oft times will fall upon them,and scratch and abuse them shrewdly.*Cunning men and of course cunning women continued to practice in the Englishcountryside until at least the end of the 18th century.James Cunning Murrell of Hadleigh in Essex is perhaps the most celebrated cunningman of all. Like Joseph Blagrave he was a great proponent of the Witch bottle.He often travelled great distances, always at night. Frequently his mission was toexorcize an evil spirit from a house and occasionally from a human being. Epilepsywas as little understood in the Hadleigh of the last century as it had been threehundred years earlier, and hysteria and attacks of fits were often ascribed towitchcraft. In the following legend may be seen the methods used by the CunningMan in combating a witch.Some time in the 1850s a young woman went into a barn where the harvesters had lefttheir beer. She discovered an old gipsy there and roughly ordered her out. The gipsytrudged off, muttering: You'll be sorry for this, my girl. Almost immediately the girlwas attacked by a series of fits. She ran on all fours, mewed like a cat, barked like a dogand was uncontrollable.Suspecting witchcraft, her family called in Cunning Murrell, who at once confirmedtheir suspicions. The wizard then prepared a concoction comprising the urine of thebewitched girl, together with blood, herbs and pins. These were put into a bottle and"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"heated on the fire. The room was darkened, the doors locked and the family instructedto maintain a strict silence or the counter-spell would be broken.Presently footsteps were heard outside the door. This was followed by a furiousknocking, while the voice of an old woman cried out: For God's sake, stop. You'rekilling me.At that moment the bottle exploded and the voice outside gradually died away. Fromthen on the sick girl recovered. In the morning the body of an old gipsy woman coveredwith dreadful burns was discovered in the road three miles away.This legend indicates how little the traditional form of witch belief had altered sincethe 17th century in a district which was less than forty miles from London.Towards the end of 1860 Murrell was taken ill. He called for a pen and paper, andcalculated that he would die on the 16th of December and calmly awaited the end.His last hours were disturbed by the frantic efforts of the Curate to administerreligious consolation. At last Murrell could stand it no longer, and fixing hispiercing eyes on him, he roared ‘I am the Devil's master’ and the Curate fled interror from the room.†Unlike the diabolical Edmund Hartlay it was James Cunning Murrell's proudest boastthat I never put on, but only put off, by which he meant that he never put a spell onanyone but used his talents only for good, putting off the spells of others and dispellingunclean spirits.Very many examples of the Ritual of Exorcism used by cunning men have survived.They range from the incredibly simple, such as the charm below, which was found atMadeley in Shropshire in 1882: I charge all Witches and Ghosts to depart from thishouse, in the great name of Jehovah and Alpha and Omega.‡ others are very complexsuch as a charm found by Jeremiah Garnett esq. of Roefield Clitheroe in Lancashireduring the early 19th century which was deciphered by his brother the Reverend RichardGarnett, an historian at the British Museum in 1825. The charm included magic numbersquares, kabalistic symbols, astrological sigils and an angelic seal of St Michael. Thecharm also included a fairly standard exorcism text in Latin, the legible portions ofwhich are reproduced below.ut dicitur decimo septimo capitulo Sancti Matthaei a vigesimo carminefide demoveatis montes, fiat secundum fidem, si sit, vel fueritut cunque fascinum vel daemon habitat vel perturbat hancpersonam, vel hunc locum, vel hanc bestiam, adjuro te, abireSine perturbatione, molestia, vel tumultu minime, nominePatris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sanctu.

With the fourth line, then, webegin our translation.As it is said in the seventeenth chapter of St. Matthew, at the twentieth verse, ‘Byfaith ye may remove mountains: be it according to [my] faith,’* if there is, or evershall be, witchcraft [or enchantment] or evil spirit, that haunts or troubles thisperson, or this place, or this beast [or these cattle], I adjure thee to depart, withoutdisturbance, molestation, or trouble in the least, in the name of the Father, and ofthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost.Robert Kirk's A Short Treatise of the Scottish-Irish Charms and Spells, provides us withseveral good examples of exorcisms dating to the late 17th century from Perthshire inScotland. Below is a charm against the palsy and falling sickness.In nomine patris et fili et spiritus sancti amen.

Like the wind, this breathtranscends all boundaries; it flows softly, speaking words to the soul in atongue we know as the Language of Night, conveying the knowledge of elders bothhuman and fey. In this choreography of ritual, emotion and surrender we remember andlearn the songs of the old folk whose strength proved vital for the survival of ourfamilies. This contemplation provides the location where both our personal and spiritualpower resides.Power is activated through will; this is what allows us to shape our reality inaccordance to our perception, and this determines the type of relationships we developwith our surroundings. Power-bonds among people are manifested through respect,kinship, imposition or denial. The same is true within our community, our family andalso within the animal and plant kingdoms and the world of spirits. In order to properlyexercise the gift of our own will, and to direct power correctly, respect and kinship mustbe at the forefront of our relationship with the world around us.Being cordial or making fair pacts with spirits will attract those who may aid us. Inorder for power to manifest there must be at least one entity which projects it, andanother who is receptive to it. In our belief, it is incorrect to assume that our power issubjectively created and that it exceeds the powers of other entities. What is more, ifthis belief were in fact true, the source of human power is not a capability honed byhumans at all. The manifestation of our will is directed by powers beyond the control ofmost people in our world, and it is this which makes human beings what they are.The same happens within the animal and plant kingdoms, which are equally subjectto the manifestation of will, in this case through certain spiritual intelligences whichawaken them. These intelligences are the reason why the world of spirits or moreprecisely the world of fairy is so intimately connected to them.

This willpower was once aligned with thatof the fey, entities which inhabit the otherworld in communities we refer to as courts, orfatara. Our myths, knowledge and inspiration recount the common lineage we sharewith those of the fairy race. It is also said that the occult bonds of kinship with thesehidden people were once present in the worldview of the old folk, and that there aresome who were born with an awakened sight who could recognize the nature of thosebonds.The folklore of every era is full of stories about the meetings between humans andfairies, and how these encounters sometimes bring death to the human or insteadunleash the power to heal, grant seership, make predictions, shapeshift, or walk betweenthe worlds. But in order for these gifts to be bestowed ordeals must be suffered, taboosmust be observed and obeisance to ruling entities must be rendered. This is mandatoryeven for those who are born with an awakened sight. The reason for this is that wewould otherwise become something that we are not; a witch is a witch because he or sheis human in part. If a witch loses its human nature, then they are no longer a witch andwill die, only to become a spirit of the land. Taboo exists to prevent this occurring.Taboo defines what a human being is, and the reality to which they belong, accordingto the standards of their specific culture. Taboo prevents human beings from becoming‘other’ and conventionally serves to set the unspoken rules by which a communityinteracts with nature. Nevertheless in every community there is always someone withthe capacity to travel between the worlds and commune with the spirits. The role ofmediator between both sides of reality must be fulfilled by someone with that capacity.The other must manifest an entity of its own in order for the community to be definablein opposition to it. In primitive cultures the other is always related to the unknown, theworld of spirits, or the different manifestations of its creatures. However, the witch"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"doesn't neatly fit into this category.The witch is a creature who always stands in-between, understanding itself as notbelonging to a community at all, although s/he is often part of one. Half of its nature isbound to the world of man, but its spirit and soul belong to the other, the realm ofdarkness and the occult. If getting immersed in the other is inherent to the nature of thewitch, what better way of fulfilling one's inclinations than by using taboos themselvesas indicative of the other? This is the principle which defines the liturgy of our house.The understanding of taboo is vital in order to be able to learn the Language of Nightand understand the way we work with the spirits. This particular form of language isarticulated beyond the purely cognitive sphere, its expression being an art of subtletyinvolving the breath and the sight manifested at once; this has its source beyond theself.We are taught that observing taboo is essential in avoiding the mirror trappings anddangers in dealing with the hidden people. But it is important to note that taboo does notequal ‘the forbidden.’ It simply means that there is a line which a human should notcross unless they wish to die, disappear and cease to be, or lose their identity withintheir community. But the witch is already beyond this line, so in our house we havebeen guided by the patronage of faerie entities towards overcoming these taboos as ameans to reach the otherworld, and specifically the place where the courts dwell, not theother way around as folk stories warn. The bulk of our work relies on articulating thoseminute guiding principles in ritualistic and ecstatic experiences within the land. Thevirtue and purpose of this is based in the recognition of our ancestry and anunderstanding of who we are and where our rebellious spirits originate from.The loss of connection to the otherworld which we have culturally inherited hasmeant the retarding of our evolution. But for us witches the careful analysis of thisreversal reveals the way forward through themes that are all the more relevant to thediscussion ahead. We can consider the previous examples, the fear for darkness and fearof nature, as potential sources of taboo, and thus also of power. The lack of power-bonds with the otherworld in our age has made our perceptions stagnate, diminished ourcapacity for survival, for exercising our will, and ultimately for connecting with reality.However, by approaching darkness and the wild with absolute surrender, we are able tofind a huge amount of power. It flows between us and the spirits. This processtransforms fear into physical, mental, and spiritual strength, and by working in this waywe become purer beings and progressively recover the virtue we have been losing downthe long road of the centuries. It is difficult to detach the concept of taboo from that ofpower, because taboo is in essence a form of power. Yet it cannot be forgotten that thisis just a means by which we can reach a deeper understanding of our reality, and honorand evolve in our own way; not a manifestation of power for power's sake.The nature of the witch is eternally bound to the other, we realise that no archetypalself identifies the witch; the witch transgresses the limits that define the self, making"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"this transgression the liturgy by which he or she gains access to the world of spirits. Atthe same time, by becoming other the witch transcends the very concept of other,becoming something completely different, permeating all the worlds apprehended bymen. By overcoming the duality between self and other we become the eternal one. Thisone is the center of our being, our spirit and the axis mundi.The identification of the center of our being as equivalent to the center of the worldis, in our opinion, fundamental to understanding the complex relationship witchesmaintain with the spirits. Cosmology was once intimately connected with features ofthe land. Sometimes a tree was considered the center of the world, at other times it wasa stone, a mountain, a spring. Our approach is no different in our dealing with theblessed ones. There is a mountain inhabited by a company of spirits of diverse natures,which span from the most chthonic and primordially unruly forces to the highestessences of the angelic. At its core the source of our sacred fire issues forth.Fire has a number of meanings here, the most important of which is that it is thepower of creation; it was revealed at the beginning of time by a sacred union betweenheaven and earth. In this union the first fire bloomed, and from it came all the wondersof nature through a number of mysterious processes. It is this first fire which burns atthe heart of the witch, which warms its blood, and raises its passion in the path offulfilling its fate. This fiery seed is shared with the blessed ones of the mountain, whichare our companions on the path of the night.The quest of the witch according to the ways of our house is ultimately to reach thevirtue necessary for gaining access to the center of the mountain, merging with the firewhich burns within its depths. Some witches prefer to live a simple life and do notstrive towards ultimately merging with the center, but are content to exist close to themountain, revering their ancestry and living according to the old ways. The capacity forhealing, magic, seership et al is sometimes all that is needed in order to fulfill one'sfate, leaving the essentially mystical connotations of such occult knowledge for othersto consider. What is important is to maintain respectful reverence and nurture ourrelationship with the patron spirits of our House. Even in those cases where the witchtreads the old paths in a simple way, the inner passion towards the source never ceasesto exist, as that is the nature (a curse according to the vulgar) of the witch.This sublime love and attraction is what allows for the identification of the center ofthe world with the center of our being. The relationship the witch has with the entitieswhich inhabit this world is defined by this identification. It is what indicates the patronspirits which are to lead our way; the transformations each one of us have to undergo inorder to gain further knowledge, the ordeals we have to suffer, and the sacrifices to bemade to prove our virtue. In the midst of these transactions power is derived and thespiritual currents which nurture our ways are kept alive.The foundations of every cosmology are primarily spiritual, and in our modern worldpeople are more prone to migration, but that doesn't mean that a connection with the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"land of one's birth, the center of our world, whatever it may be, is necessarilydiminished. Indeed, the domicile of all things spiritual is the otherworld. By this naturalidentification almost instantly the realm of night is evoked, marking the moment wherespirits roam the surface of the earth, and witches access the oneiric dominions fromwhere they can tread the sacred land in the company of spirits.The psyche of the witch is the same; their blood never loses its sympathies for theirland, and passion does not wane during their sojourn. What happens in these instances isthat the spiritual land of our cosmology conjoins with the physical land we currentlyinhabit. In these cases, the witch will look to identify the places of power where ingressis granted. These are the physical places that match the spiritual loci and power of theotherworldly land of our heritage. It would be ideal to find a location in which to livethat completely meshes with the entire cosmology we have inherited. Needless to say, itis most powerful if the place we live in is native to the particular cosmology weembrace, but that is not a prerequisite for working with the land. There will bedifferences, tangible changes in the telluric forces and certain kinds of spirits attachedto the physical land, but the core, the anchor, the retinue of patron spirits which sustainthis perpetual passion for everyone in the family will always remain the same, nomatter where we are. Virtue is what kindles this passion and nurtures it. The brighter thefire, the stronger the connection becomes.There is a meeting point between the serpent of the territory, the fiery force whichanimates the earth below our feet, the courts of the blessed ones which inhabit thisterritory, and the entities native to our spiritual land. This is the crossroads where thedifferent worlds merge together to form a conjunction of power wherein everythingbecomes one during ritual. One path is bound to the earth; the other path is bound to ourblood. In the intersection of the two is our path cast, as iron fallen from the stars.The blood, the mothers and patrons of our ancestry are related in our house to thepowers of the moon. Whereas the serpent is common to all territories, and can beexperienced by everyone regardless of their tradition, the path of the moon is specific toeach house. It is the one which contains the keys to our centre, and the taboos whichallow access to the knowledge of our antecessors, and the land where the source of oursacred fire, our power and our love exist. The crossing between the paths of the serpentand the moon opens the gates of understanding and transformation within us. But theliturgy of taboo must be strictly observed if profit is expected from this conjunction.Heredity is first experienced in the flesh, the body from which we are born and towhich our destiny is fixed by time, territory and the celestial bodies. It is through theunbroken chain of mothers that every one of us exists. This may be interpreted asmeaning that we all come from the same mother; we are sons of an ancient femalebeing who was the first of her kind, blessed with the gift of will, and the seed of fire inher blood. The reasons for this blessing are part of what we call the ‘Pacts of Old,’which go far beyond the laws of taboo. The purpose of these is one of the mysteries"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"which give an explanation of the origin of all beings including those of the fairy race.But this is beyond biological considerations and is inevitably connected with myth andsymbols of power.Darkness is one of these, it is the realm of the first Mother. The atavistic reaches ofour psyche go back to that realm, the most hidden source of reality. Her dominions areof infinite extension; they are so vast that they cannot be expressed through words.There is no way to disclose its whole nature in common language, concept, image orfeeling, and this forms the first of the taboos of men: fearful darkness which must beconquered before delving into the world of spirits, in order to reveal the many secrets ofthe unknown and our ancestry.The wonder of infinity can be contemplated beneath a starry sky, but night raisesterrors in people. The enchantment of the stars upon men in contemplation relievesthem of the duty of keeping ward against the threat of predators; this is another taboo.Overcoming these terrors is a precondition for the contemplation of the vastness of ourgenealogy, its comprehension being mirrored by all the possible permutations amongthe stars. But how can one do so without perishing by the jaws of the wild beasts of thenight? The only way is by giving yourself up to all the spirits, fair or foul, surrenderingin love eternal, which means merging with them. This act is one of recognition of thepacts of old, of which the satyr and the nymph are representative. It is the everlastingpersecution that eternally leads the lover towards the loved one, sexual pleasure, or theviolent act of raping where harmony is absent. But the secret is that both acts belong tothe same force, both are a manifestation of the same power. Both ‘rape’ and ‘passion’ inthis instance are mythologems, and express a metaphor of how the nuclear forcesbehind this sublime form of Love are stronger than other opposing forces. This forcecan be experienced in the caves in mountains, penetrated by forces apparently milderthan the strength of stones. It is the breath of the hidden. It is the manifestation of thevoid through the matrix of the first mother. It is the very same vast force that allowswomen to give birth to their children, beyond pain and pleasure. The source of thatpower is a form of awe-inspiring fire, which reaches back to the first mother every timea child is born. Thus the cave in the mountain, the night (both mirroring darkness andfear of the unknown) become a necessary referent in pursuing the path against the lawsof taboo.The understanding of the path towards the one is learned through ordeal and trial asput forward by our fellow men during the day as well as our spiritual benefactors andmalefactors at night, and we mean that literally. The messages from the spirits flowthroughout all layers of reality, including dreams and vigil. Indeed, we receive thembefore we are aware of them. An omen is produced when our attention is fixed to asynchronic event happening within or without us at the same time. All images of thesacred, symbols and icons are portals for the manifestation of these messages. There isno single way for divine or spiritual messages to manifest: the choices are limitless."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"These events occur most often during moments of tranquility and contemplation, manyof which are empowered during the night, dreaming, or during liminal occurrences oficonic beauty or significance for the witch.Awakening the Sight and the understanding of the merging of the world of matter andthe world of spirits is the basis of all our work, and we all strive for it through differentrituals involving the application of the formulae of taboo; pushing against allpreconceived notions we have, exposing oneself to the wild that the way might beshown by our tutelary spirits. There is no moment that defines the witch more than thesurrender to the unknown in the path of spirit, because by this act the psychologicalbarriers that keep us ignorant of our true nature are dissolved. Fear lets pure loveemerge, causing pain to succumb to ecstasy.These are the ways of our blood. It is this incredible force of ecstasy, the breath of thehidden and the fire, which will eventually cause our merging with the centre of our land.It is in the direct, unmediated union of the empyrean with the earthly that the fall of thestarry fire occurs, the curse is cast, and the otherworldly nature of faeries is manifestedonce again in the flesh. In the old lore, the mating of one of the fairy realm and a humanmarks the beginning of the witch's race. In becoming one, according to the ways of ourhouse, we become our own creators, we reenact the primal union of heaven and earthand we become one with the source of our power and heritage.It is through the Language of the Night, which contains the knowledge of what is sacredto our family, that we come to recognise and understand taboos. In the contemplationand application of the wisdom therein is the knowledge by which we learn the ways toovercome them. It is a tricky and dangerous path, but love and the favor of our mother,queen of the blessed ones, is what allows us to proceed through the ordeals and terrorsof the way.There is no straight path towards success in this endeavor, and the path is singularlyone for every witch. Not many will understand, but we would be content if they at leastbear in mind how important power and mastering the relationship we have with thespiritual world around us is, in order to exercise our will to its full potential for thebenefit of all humankind. How should we ride through the mists if it is not riding the Serpent? How are we to understand without the intercession of the Blessed Ones? How are we to see without the Fire of the Mother? How are we to reach Her domains"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" and not be exterminated by the Dragon, without the virtue of Love and Wisdom?

From the start of the process of urbanization at the end of the18oos up until age of modernization in the late 1940s, most practitionerswere weighed down by the social stigma of association with evil spiritualforces, or subject to ridicule for indulging in superstitious actions which implied a lackof education or intellect. The vocabulary of practitioners has changed, and the contextof their methods and procedures has been kept under the lid of silence for the past sixtyyears or more. This description of a regular working day, with some historical contextand an explanation of the traditional roots of the methods may help shed some light onthe real nature of Trolldom.I arrive at a small apartment block in a suburb just north of the city of Gothenburg onthe Swedish West coast. The clients living here are a Serbian couple in their mid 30s.They are second generation Yugoslavian immigrants and, as with most people fromrural or just recently urbanized cultures, their lives still include some folk magicconcepts and experiences.For more than a year the couple has experienced many kinds of difficulties and thewoman claims that the reason behind all the trouble is that another female, envious ofthe stable income and happy marriage the couple enjoys, is using black magic to destroytheir life, their income and their relationship.The couple heard from a friend that I ‘know a bit about these things’ and ‘is the oneto call when things like this happen.’ Like most urban people the couple is not at allfamiliar with the Swedish folk magic tradition of Trolldom.The word troll, in this regards often used as a prefix, is a complex word. Since theage of the sagas it has been in use to describe something out of the ordinary, somethingspiritual moving in the air and also something slightly uncomfortable. The noun trollhas also been in use as a collective word to describe spirits and deities of older culturallayers and beliefs that are now unwanted and dangerous for the contemporary culture. Inthe popular culture of today it is used to describe a form of North European naturespirits. Those dealing with these powers and spirits are usually described as trollkunnig,that is, able to perform magic, or knowledgeable in magic. My grandmother'sgeneration did not use socially loaded terms like this at all. They usually describedpeople who were trollkunninga as those who ‘know a bit more than others’ or ‘someonewho knows a bit more than his Our Father.’ In her parent's days and before, the termklok, that is wise, or cunning was more common. That generation also used specificterms like Signare, someone who reads charms and incantations, and blygumma, a"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"woman who uses the method of melting lead to divine and to cure. They might haveeven used terms like kuckelgubbe, originally derived from the eerie sound peoplethought to come from ancient grave mounds when the spirits awoke; orkyrkogårdsgångare, a person who walks in cemeteries. Every generation has used theterms trollgubbe, an old man practicing Trolldom, and trollgumma, for an old womanpracticing Trolldom, but the word was usually too socially loaded and they preferredother terms.Like most people this couple would never use the term häxa, a witch, or speakoutright about magic. They just wanted help and they heard I could provide it.I did not inherit all my troll formulæ but I have the gift of synskhet, seership andvarma hander, warm hands, which is the old term for a person with natural healingabilities. These gifts run very strongly through my family and I am not the only onewho does odd things for a living. When it comes to the traditional practices, a lot weretaught by my grandmother and others, who constantly denied knowing anything at allabout magic. In my early days I too had no idea that these things were magical at all.They were simply the things which were done when you were having trouble, when youwere sick, that only happened when someone in the family was upset and, sometimes,things were done just for fun. It was not until later in my life that I found out that mygrandmother, and others of her generation, usually became curt and looked away in aslightly shameful way if asked whether they knew any Trolldom or things associatedwith these ideas. When talking or demonstrating the very techniques they usually gavethe short introduction that this was what they used to do ‘in the old days’ or what once‘was done out on the countryside’ if this or that problem occurred. Such a frame is anice way to avoid the social drama attached to loaded words and is what I also use, as itallows me to focus on actually solving the problems I am confronted with.Referring to the past is a long standing tradition when talking about Trolldom. ‘This ishow they used to do it in the old days’ has been said about acts of magic since the daysof the Sagas. In fact one of the other old words for trolldom used in the saga Age is siðr,custom. It is often referred to as forni siðr, the old custom, and one of the more popularnames for a trolldom practitioner was forneskja, meaning one that knows (or practices)the customs of the past. In time the negative associations of this falls away, whileframing contemporary practice in the past remains a customary way of talking abouttrolldom.What my grandmother and others did not teach me about Trolldom I learned throughold-fashioned Svartkonst books, books of the black art or Black Books as they are calledby people who study them in the academy. These are usually handwritten books thatcontain a collection of spells, remedies and procedures to cure, harm and increaseincome. The oldest preserved one, the Norwegian Vinjeboka has been dated to 1480. Infact, most of the material in these books first came from the almanacs published all"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"over Europe. One of the most influential books in the second half of the past milleniawas published in Stockholm in 1650. It was a translation of Magia Naturalis LibriQuatuor by the German Wolfgangi Hildebrandi, first published in Leipzig in 1610. Itcontains everything from how to dye hair and keep bees, to making love talismans andremoving spiritual problems. From this many methods were copied into local black artbooks and these were complemented with orally transmitted material. In time moreorally transmitted and local material was incorporated and the books were marketedwith claims of having been authored by historical figures such as Moses, Faust andCyprianus or associated with the legendary German town of Wittenberg, in which mostNordic priests received their education and from where much magic was said to havecome into the Nordic countries. That is, of course, not literally true and rather belongsto the drama of Trolldom and the Black Arts than the actual folk practice, much ofwhich had been around since before Christ was born.Just having a black book, or the reputation of having one was previously enough to becounted as someone knowledgeable in magic. It did not matter that most of the materialin these books would not be counted as magic at all by modern standards. Theyprovided a person with tydor and knowledge stronger than most. Since folklore began tobe studied in the late 18th century, the books of magic in Scandinavia changedradically. The collections of handwritten, printed and orally transmitted informationgathered in these are something that Trolldom practitioners of old could only dream of.More than 50, 000 verbal charms have been collected since the beginning of folklore inSweden alone. Not that one would ever need more than a handful, but this changed thebooks of the black arts forever.My current clients know nothing about this and they probably do not care at all.Once we are introduced and they have given me some background and informationabout their troubles it is time for me to make a diagnosis. This process involvesdivination, or rather triggering seeing through various means of divination in order todiagnose what the origins of the problem might be. We call this process spådom. Theword is as old as Trolldom and it is often used as a synonym for it, or at least it used tobe. Nowadays it usually means to see the future, even though what can be seen throughthis is much more than just possible futures. A qualified guess is that they used it as asynonym because the ability to see the future is very closely tied to being able to changeit as well. Many Swedish words bear witness to this: förutspå, to predict the future,förutse, to see ahead, and förgöra, to destroy; the most common term for the act ofdestructive Trolldom is förbanna, curse: all imply spiritual acts and the ability to placesomething in a future that has not yet taken place. This is why tieing knots on a threadwas such a common method in the old days, since threads and bonds were stronglyconnected to the thread of life and time itself.In Trolldom the meaning contained in an event, a material, a person etc. is a powerthat is always in action. This meaning is called tyda. The word also means a sign, so"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"when doing spådom one is taking tydor, which means both collecting various signs andaccessing the power behind them. Spådom and Trolldom in this regard become veryconnected and once you have the tyda you can use it to perform Trolldom. The tydor(pl.) is usually defined and enhanced by the use of the spoken word and/or by actions.The spoken words increase the power of the tyda, which means that speaking out loudabout what is seen during spådom is a risky process. It can become an ofärdsspådom,the old word ofärd means bad fate, something that enhances the wrong tydor andnegatively affects the future. It was a common way to curse people in the old days andas such it often appears on old rune stones as a curse against anyone damaging thestone. Nowadays such curses are not usually that deliberate, but in everyday life theyare tremendously common. The first thing to look for in spådom is the state of therelationship the people have to the spirits around them. How do the local spirits feelabout these people? Why were they not protected? It is a pretty predictable thing thesedays, since most people neither know nor care about the spirits that surround them. Butnevertheless, it may pay to check this. My version is not like most people used to do it;whether melting lead or wax through the hole in a bread cake held above the heads ofthe persons, by pouring egg white into a glass of water or by laying cards. My version ofit is simply calling the spirits and asking them about their opinion of the clients in a lowtone of voice.The first, and often regarded as the most important spirit, is the tomte or bo-vätte,who is responsible for all the luck in the house, the tomtebolycka. In Trolldom the tomteis usually regarded as more of a title and a function and it is often said that the firstperson who dies in a house becomes the tomte or that he arrives the first time fire ismade in a house. As a spirit of the dead, the tomte, by being dead, has power over thegeneral luck in a place and can draw in or remove luck depending on how he is treatedby the living inhabitants. If offended they can wreak havoc, or leave, which isconsidered very bad luck. In that case the person who is trollkunnig can remove or evensell the tomte and hire another one.Most of these things are culturally forgotten today, but most people out in thecountryside still pay their tomte on Christmas eve, unknowingly continuing the mostwidespread and unbroken spiritual tradition in Swedish history. Of course few knowthat this practice is actually necromancy and prefer the cute and socially acceptabletomte form created by the poet Viktor Rydberg and the artist Jenny Nyström in the late1800s. Feed the tomte with one hand and call the spiritual mediums to remove any signsof a spöke (shining spirit of the dead) with the other and expect the tomtebolycka toprosper? A rather odd behavior, in my opinion, but there you go.My spådom reveals that there used to be a tomte in the house of my clients but heleft, apparently angered by the laziness of the woman. It is hard to blame him,considering he seems to have been a working man at one of the local shipyards and themorals of his generation are usually that everyone should be hard-working to earn their"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"living and all else is moral decay. The fact that the couple often used a language thetomte found ugly and offensive is not a good thing to verbalize either. Racist spirits areunheard of in today's literature on the subject and defy most of the common spiritualassumptions, so wording any of that will probably be counterproductive in this case. Iwill try to get a new tomte into their house later on. Time to talk to their vards.Today the vards are usually referred to as skyddsänglar, guardian angels. In the olddays the vard was not really an angel as most people would define it, but a spirit of thedead. Or, more accurately, a term used both to define a spiritual part of a living being aswell as describing something remaining after the death of the physical body which isable to serve as a protector. When it appears to humans it is often called a vålne orvålnad. The soul and spirit concepts of the old days are intellectually complicated dueto local variations, exchange and intermingling of terms so it is best understood throughthe function and context rather than from the modern perspective of coherent systems.The couple have no vard tree around, which is more common in the countryside,otherwise I would have gone there to talk instead of sitting in the kitchen. Spiritualresidences such as the vard trees are greatly underestimated nowadays.At first I had some trouble understanding her vard since it seemed to speak in somelanguage that was probably Serbian. But after a while it switched to sending otherimpressions that were more easily understood. The vard of the female client seemsfairly uninterested in protecting her protégé and it seems like anyone can do anything toher as far as the vard is concerned. A bit of a surprising attitude, but there you go.Telling the clients about this does not seem to be a good idea.People have so many ideas about spirits and there is no time to explain to this couplethat not all spirits are godly light beings. The vard of the man stays silent and I cannotget it to talk at all. Either it has been put to rest, or removed completely, or it has someother agenda. At least it did not seem like stopping others from doing magical harm tothe man's life was a priority to this vard. It all paints a pretty good picture of the client'sspiritual relations and it is time to proceed with the next steps of the spådom.In Trolldom the second most important thing to find out during a spådom diagnosis isusually the location where the problem first began. It can be very useful if there issomething hidden or buried on the property. In trolldom, a very common saying is thatone should ta boten där man fick soten, meaning that one should take the cure whereone contracted the problem in the first place. For example, problems originating with anoffended water spirit are best cured through water or ritual remains should be disposedof in the source location to restore proper order.I bring out a small glass, a bottle of grain alcohol and fill the glass up. Then thewoman is instructed to take a drink without swallowing and instead spit it back into theglass.Occasionally this is accompanied by speaking a trollformel in order to start theprocess of removing any problem. It is a nice way of weaving in the very act of doing"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"something about the problem during the diagnostic process. Since it is believed thatformulae lose their power when taught – and I tend to be one of those who share thisbelief, a very similar formula from 1860 reads as follows:Ture stod på berget,Thor stood on the mountain,talte till sin moder Helena:Spoke to Helen, his mother:«Skott I munn, ur munn,‘Shot in mouth, out of mouth,Bot i samma stund!»Cure in the same moment!’The procedure is repeated three times. Then I sit down with the glass and look into it.The procedure is not really necessary if one is synsk, but the closeness to her personaltrace – the spittle – makes it a bit easier and I kind of like the procedure. It is a goodintroduction to the procedure which follows and the clients usually like it.Looking at the formations made by the spittle in the glass a fairly descriptive pictureof an older woman and a younger one doing something on the ground can be seen. Thelocation where this took place is unclear but it does not appear to be anywhere nearby,so there is no use in finding out where it is. A closer, inner look reveals a cemetery andthe two women are apparently casting some sort of spell. A nasty spell by the look andfeel of it.It is unnecessary to add power to these tydor by telling the clients about it and theydo not need to know just how strong the thing put on them appears to be. The issue nowis to find something that has stronger tydor and use it to counteract what has been doneto the client. My belief is strong, so that will greatly enhance whatever material andprocedure is used but the tydor of the material must be strong as well, in order toefficiently remove and counter the spell cast on the clients. I need to seek help from thetrolls and the powers of the dead.So I bring out two small pouches of graveyard dirt bought from two separate graves atthe cemetery on a waning moon between 23:30 and 00:30 on a Thursday night.This is a classic ingredient used in Trolldom for almost every conceivable purpose.Some say the reason why most Trolldom is done on Thursdays is because in the oldercalendar the week used to have five days instead of seven. The fifth day was Helg, aword meaning sacred time, a time when peace should be observed and no work shouldoccur. This is a time when spirits are considered to be more active and interacting withthe dealings of the living. Long ago this was the time of the Ting, when the deities andancestors were present to receive gifts in exchange for luck, and to assist in solvingconflicts through ordeals. Later, when these spiritual forces came to be considered asTrolls, the day for interacting with these forces remained the same.As customary I paid the kyrkogårdsrå and asked him to find two spirits willing andable to do the work at hand. The kyrkogårdsrå, also occasionally called kyrkogrimmen,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"is the spiritual keeper of the cemetery and the dead residing there. Folklore says that thefirst one buried in a place will become its caretaker. In some places they used to saythat to get a Rå into a newly built cemetery they killed a living rooster or a calf andburied it in order for it to become the Rå of that place.This did not seem to have been the case at the cemetery that was visited whencollecting the dirt. When calling the kyrkogårdsrå at the gates of the cemetery a malespirit came along and I told him my purpose was to find a spirit willing to draw badstuff into the grave and a spirit able to work as a protector.It did not take long to find the graves. Once there I walk around the graves backwardsand counterclockwise three times and called their spirits up. The procedure of walkinglike this used to be called begå to be forbidden at one point in Swedish history becauseit was so closely related to the practice of Trolldom and the old religion's methods ofmedicine and cures. Some called this carrying water to the Devil and it was regarded asboth sinful and dangerous. It is still a common method used to enter the realm of thedead and is in use in many spells involving the dead or in the summoning of the Vålne(spirit) of a living person.Once the walking is done and a brief explanation of just what kind of help is expectedthe spirits agree and are paid by placing a few coins in exchange for the removed dirt. Ipaid the Rå on the way out as well; not all people do this, but to me it feels appropriate.In addition to the pouches of graveyard dirt I pull out a small wooden box containinga mixture of dried and powdered leaves taken from nine fruit bearing trees. These werealso collected on Thursday, with a waning moon, with circumambulation, from treesgrowing on or near old grave mounds and ancient stone circles. In this case the spiritsthat I turn to are females. Some say they are the old Völvas, Norns or priestesses of oldthat have taken up their abode in trees; some approach them under various names asHyllemor (for the spirit of Elder trees), Askefrun (for the spirit of an Ash tree) and soforth. It is rarely necessary to know who these spirits were and what they used to do andsometimes they are offended by being called by the old names. That's why I mostly callthem without any name and then respectfully tell them what is going to be done with theleaves. If there is no resistance or if they happily agree, the leaves are collected fromthe tree. The trees are always paid, either by pouring out some milk or placing somecoins amongst the roots.Finally a bottle of water is brought out from the bag. It is slightly murky since it wascollected with an upstream motion from a stream that runs towards the north.Northwards and down is the direction to the realm of the dead and the sprits and that iswhere all disturbing things belong. At least that is the general idea and it has beenempowered for a substantial amount of time in these lands, so it has some pretty strongand useful tydor. Usually strong enough to persuade most things to leave, so I settle forthat.Sometimes I use well water which is another common ingredient that has at least a"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"few thousand years of tradition to it. But the tydor of the wells too often seems to havebecome so weak that they hardly enhance my own powers of belief. This may be due tothe fact that many were so exploited in the 1800s and early 1900s by the trend of drickabrunn (well drinking). Once the upper class embraced this health trend, people stoppedpaying the Källrå (Spirit and caretaker of the well) and companies started to exploit thesacred wells for their mineral water. So people say that the wells lost most of theirpower. Others, at least the most popular, had their visitor's interest taken over by theChurch, which often, but not always, led away from the practices that give strength totheir tydor. Amusingly enough, many wells can be found in the middle of industrialareas, on hospital grounds, by big churches in the center of cities and in the middle ofdense forests where they appear forgotten. Fortunately some of them are still quitepowerful and others seem to burst into an odd cascade of power when approached andtreated according to the old customs.I explain to the couple a little about what is going to happen and then instruct them toturn off their phones, close all the windows and doors, and tell them that once they areall closed no one must enter or exit though them but me until it is all over. It seems notto be a problem. They are not expecting any visitors. Then they are told that once a signis given not a single word should be said until it is all over. No matter what happens.Not to me, not to each other, until I am completely finished and give the sign again.Furthermore, they should not speak of what happened until they have had a good night'ssleep. Not to anyone. By the look in their eyes the drama of these instructions has beenconveyed. These rules are fundamental in Trolldom and perhaps were even more so inthe past. Silence is crucial in order to control tydor. In modern terms one could say thatthe dramatic effect and traditional and cultural value of silence serves to focus thepower of belief, emotion, concentration and all other useful components that makesprocedures like this work. Plus the fact that the trollkunnig do not have to put up withthe giggling and chitchat of people who think it is entertaining and exciting, or thenervous, analytical people who feel that verbalized rationalisation needs to take place tocalm their emotions. These are good rules.I mix the alcohol and the water by stirring it with my left ring finger (it is sometimescalled the Nameless Finger), counterclockwise. Some use a knife made of nine pieces ofsteel to stir it, but the process of gathering the ingredients and the ritual involved is socomprehensive that I have not got around to making one. Whilst the liquid is beingmixed another trollformel is spoken with my mouth close to the bowl, so that the breathtouches the mixture. A similar one to the one used for the couple reads:Förr då Frälsaren kom gångandesWhen the Saviour came walkingMötte honom de ondas skottHe was met by shots from the evil onesStåndandes sju Guds andar emotStanding against were 7 spirits of GodMen sju heliga Guds änglarBut seven holy angels of God"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Lopp till botRushed to cureI den treenige GudensIn the name of the threefold GodFodrens, Sonens o. D. H. A-s namn.The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.I read it three times and blow into the water after each reading. Some say this should beread with one's teeth closely bitten together and each formula should be read in a singlebreath. But that does not make much difference to me, so I just stick to the simple stuff.To add some extra tydor the process is repeated using another formula which issimilar to this one used in the north of Sweden and documented in 1820:Det gick en finne på hafsstran,A Finn walked on the seashorehan kunde järahe could remedyför alla skottfor all kinds of shotssom i världen varthat are in the worldhan kunde görafor finnshotsför finnskottfor bloodshotsför blodskottfor trollshotsför trollskottfor evil from waterför ont av vattenfor evil from earthför ont av jordenfor evil of the weatherför ont av väderfor hate and envyför hat, för avund,for aches and painsför värk och plågorhe could remedyhan kunde görafor all kinds of shotsför allt slags skott som i världen var.that are in the world.Then I let the clients have a small sip. This time they must swallow it. In the old days itwas said that this was done to prevent the bad stuff from going inwards. I don't knowabout that but to me it is a very good way to make things come out and stay out. Now itis time to wash them down.As previously instructed the couple have now stripped down to their undergarments.People tend to be quite uncomfortable and feel vulnerable with this and that works tomake their subconscious add to the impact of the work. The couple is looking down andthe man has his hands covering his privates, which is a good sign that they feelvulnerable. I start with him, so he feels more comfortable when doing the same for herlater on. She will also feel more comfortable since her protective male will undergo theprocess first and she will see his acceptance. It will make her subconscious more"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"passive.I dip the pouch containing the dirt from the spirit that promised removal in thewater/alcohol mix and begin the washing. The procedure is usually called smörjning,which means anointing, and the term covers both procedures of washing someone downwith liquids and anointing with ointments, salves and moist things.Starting from the left side of his head going crosswise down to his right foot, thenfrom his right side down to the left foot. Then the same is done on his back. Once that isdone it goes three times counterclockwise around each limb downwards; his neck, hiselbows, his wrists, his hips, his knees and finally his feet. The pouch of graveyard dirt isdipped in the water afresh for each limb. All the while he is being washed anothertrollformel is spoken. Some speak it out loud, but I prefer to keep it in a low toned voiceand let the voice rise and fall on its own, depending on whether it hits resistance andneeds added power.A quite similar formula to the one used in this part of the procedure was used byHanna Isachs in Malmö, Sweden who, for this practice faced a court sentence in 1706.Here is her version: För min andeBefore my spirit To händerTwo hands Och 10 fingrarAnd ten fingers 12 Gudz englar12 angels of God Skall skyShall shun Och flyAnd flee Allt ondt!All evil! I nampn...In the names ... [Father, Son and Holy Spirit]Once the washing is done the man is asked to spit into the bowl three times and I thenspit into it myself to fix whatever nastiness is in it.The smörjning is finished by making the sign of the cross on his head, his chest,hands and feet with my left nameless finger. The whole procedure is then repeated onthe woman.After the spitting is done the bowl is placed outside the threshold of the house and Ispit once more into it, whilst standing inside the house. That should keep any nastinessoutside until it is time to dispose of it. Then it is time for the process of röka (smoking)the clients.A small brass incense holder is brought out from the bag and charcoal is lit and placed"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"on it. When it is glowing red I add the powdered leaf-mix of the fruit bearing trees andsmoke the couple using the same procedure as I did with the liquid and the graveyarddirt previously. Sometimes the remaining ashes are then used to anoint the clients, butthe idea of walking around with their faces smeared with ash might be a bit much forthese urban folks so the incense holder is just put aside to cool off.If any of these procedures had been used alone, I would have repeated the wholeprocess of smörja or röka three times. Or even nine times if necessary.Once the smoking was complete my next step was to send back the evil and teach theperson on the other end of this problem a little lesson. I rarely tell my clients that theprocedure is about sending things back and hitting the people who sent it, unless theyare experienced practitioners themselves.There are so many assumptions carried by regular folks when it comes to punishingsomeone through the use of Trolldom. They get afraid that the other person will be hurtand they don't want to be responsible. Sometimes they think the culprit will die inagony and leave the client with a harsh judgment from God that may cast them out ofheaven when they die. In fact it usually does not harm the person on the receiving endvery much at all; at least not physically. People are rarely that sensitive and have anintellectual agenda to try to rationalise things within their own worldview, so whilst thereal reason why they fall and hit their head is clear to their spirit, they usually think itwas an accident and do not pursue it further. But since their spirit knows, they tend toavoid the behavior causing the fall and thus they usually leave my clients alone orbehave better in the future. But I don't have time to explain all this, so I avoid tellingthe clients what this part of the work is for.Sometimes I draw blood from the left little finger of the client afflicted by a curseand twitch the hand over an open fire so the blood gets into the fire in order to send shitback, but even though it can be done on an electric stove the tyda does not have thestrength of an open fire and new clients usually respond pretty dramatically whensomeone cuts them with a sharp knife even if it is explained beforehand. So, no cuttingand blood staunching in their kitchen. Instead I bring out a small wooden ring made ofbirch and place it on the threshold. A few strands of hair taken from the nape of thenecks of my clients, a coin for the broken economy and three pieces of glowingcharcoal. I use incense charcoal again and put it on their electric stove and heat them upuntil they are glowing. It isn't the heart fire of the living fire stoves of the old days, butthis tyda will have to do. I use very small coals, since this place is located in a city andwe do not want to trigger a fire alarm.I place it all inside the birch ring and bring out my small hand axe. The names of thepersons suspected and anyone else who might be a culprit is mentioned as a recipient ofwhat is about to be reversed is addressed out loud and another trollformel is spoken. Amilder and less controversial one from Dalarna, Sweden in 1717 reads as follows:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" Jag skall binda en biörnrahm Och ulftand för troll källingen I Faderns, Sonens och Den Helige Andes Namn! I shall bind a Bears frame And wolf's tooth for [around] the Troll-bitch [sorceress] In the names ofFather, Son and Holy Spirit! Then I smack the backside of the axe in the middle of the ring. It should be done hardand it is usually only repeated once, but I always wait a bit to get an indication as towhether it worked or not. If not, I repeat the blow up to nine times. This time it seemedsufficient with just one blow. The blow left a fairly deep black mark in their threshold,but I doubt they minded it much.In the old days this procedure was often said to kill the guilty party. This has neverhappened for me, but it tends to put an end to things and I settle for that. I remove thering, brush off the coals and the hair outwards and return the coin to the couple.Now it is time to dispose of the stuff.I make a gesture to the couple to sit down and go out to put on my shoes and jacketand grab my bag of tricks. I pick up the bowl outside and head down to a nearby threeway crossroad I spotted on the way here. Three way crossroads also play a major role inTrolldom. This is where people go to dispose of ritual remains, diseases, problems andnasty spirits. This is where one goes to meet with spirits and deities, to do yearlydivinations and so on. The place where three roads meet (or where three borders meet)is where the Ting was often held, judgments were settled by the deities and ancestorsthrough ordeals and so on.This suburban crossroad does not have a slightest trace of something that could beassociated with fantasies of Viking kings, Blot-priests, all powerful Völvas proclaimingthe destinies of men, bloody ordeal duels or the kind of majestic greenery associatedwith the ancient power of the Old Norse. Not at all. Shabby looking red brick wallssurround it and the ground is covered with a tarnished and worn down grey tarmac. Anempty coke bottle and a bunch of cigarette butts add to the vapid impression. But theroad seems fairly old and people have traveled here for quite a few years which meanthat so do the spirits of the dead and god knows what other unseen things. Good enoughfor me.I call upon the spirits nearby with a short whistle and a prayer. It is a roughneighborhood, so many of the dead around here are too young and lack the workingmorals that would keep them more or less self-powered. But then an older manapproaches. I silently tell him about the situation and he agrees to serve the couple as aTomte. I bring out a small stone, taken from a cemetery, place it on the ground and ask"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"him to hold onto the stone in order for me to bring him back to their house. Afterwaiting a moment I put the stone back in my bag. Then I grab the bowl, turn my back tothe middle of the crossroad and toss the contents over my left shoulder. Sometimes Ispeak a formula when doing this, but this time I skip that part and just walk away, notlooking back.On my way back I walk around the apartment building and pick up dirt from eachcorner. In its place I put some small hazel sticks. These used to be called hassla andwere used to set up a sacred place. Way back when, the sticks were connected by bonds,ve-bonds, and breaking these bonds and the peace within them was a very serious crime.The same kind of hazel enclosures were used to set up the spots for ordeals like thefamous envig (duel). Setting one foot outside these bonds meant you lost and wereseverely punished both economically and socially. In later times the hazel was used tomark borders and declare ownership of land. With that in mind it is quite easy tounderstand why hazel became the most popular tree to use when making magical circlesto keep spirits in or out.While placing the branches and collecting the dirt from the corners I also sprinkle someof the graveyard dirt from the other bag. This procedure is called ställa (to makesomeone stand) and is usually done in order to keep thieves in or out and to protectwhatever is inside the circle. Like all the other procedures, this is often accompanied bya spoken formula, in order to enhance the tydor. The one I used is very similar to thisone: Nio voro de Nockunden söner Som noren förde Som buro deras moder döder Vi bar de henne så döder? För hon skulle alla mål hölja och dölja Som hon gjorde så skall och jag göra Jag ska binda elden, där han brann Jag ska binda kitteln, där han vann Jag ska binda mannen, där han red Jag ska binda skeppet, där han skred Jag ska binda järngårdar Så de gråta blodstårar. Nine were the sons of Nockunden Who brought the Norn"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" Who carried their dead mother Why did they carry her so dead? So that she all targets cloak and hide As she did, so shall I do I will bind the fire where he burned I will bind the kettle where he runs I will bind the man where he rode I will bind the ship where it strode I will bind iron gates So it will shed tears of blood. This particular version of the formula belonged to woman named Elin who wascondemned to death, tortured and executed in a trial in the village of Ronneby inSweden in 1679. The formula also occurs in Denmark and has been in use to bindenemies, dampen anger, put out fires and more. Its origin may be more than 1000 yearsold and may refer to the old tradition of carrying around dead ancestors (who wereregarded as having become one of the gods after death). In this case the woman calledNoren may refer to her being as a Norn, which as anyone familiar with the latermythology of the Norse, means that she was a weaver of fates and a Trollkvinna.I mumble my formula until the whole block is surrounded, dirt is collected fromevery corner and the hazel sticks are in place. Then it is time to yell. After a littlesearching I find the closest earthbound rock. It is a stone about 80 cm tall that seems tohave survived the bulldozers at the time this complex was built and was left as somesort of decorative element. It will have to do.The concept of binding through the earth goes back into the mists of Scandinavianhistory. The power of earthbound rock does as well. In the old days they were calledUnlausan (Not loose) or Stupan (Steady). Their tyda is one of stability over longperiods of time, of something meant to last, of something having more power over acertain place than any moving thing on the surface. It gives authority over all mobilethings. The Unlausan are as important as the concept of the crossroad and the burialplaces in Trolldom practice. The lands of Scandinavia are filled with Unlausan rocks.Some were raised by men, some were moved by the Great Ice during the last Ice Ageand scattered across the landscape as if thrown there by Jotnar (giants), some are justlittle peaks of solid rock sticking up in an otherwise grass covered landscape. They allcount as earthbound rocks in the history of Trolldom. Since they have the tyda of beingable to affect the land over time it is said that judges used to sit on them whenproclaiming verdicts at local Ting, kings were elected on top of some and vows ofvarious sorts were proclaimed on them. There are many stone circles like this around"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Sweden and they are called domarringar (Judges’ Rings). One famous Black Book evensays that: all Trolldom should take place on a Thursday on an earthbound rock(Heurgren, 1918), again indicating the close ties between old law and the magicaltradition.So, that is why I am climbing up on this grey block. I want to make an imprint on thislittle piece of land, where my clients live. The procedure I am about to perform can alsobe labeled stämma. The term originally (and still) means to be called to the Ting. Notobeying the call meant being exiled or certain death, so it was a pretty strong call.Knowing this, stämma has and is still being used in Trolldom as a description of theprocess to stop or move people, animals, blood in the veins and so on. People often usedthis in the days of my great grandmother to keep out wolves or bears or even wanderingcriminals. The same process is often used to draw in luck and other desired things, butthen it is not called stämma. I will use it to keep out the bad influences sent towards myclients. The point is that everything that comes within hearing distance should beaffected.Some shout out a trollformel in plain words but I usually tend to make it sound a bitlike an attempt to sing in a very high pitched tone, and project it as far as possible. It isthe tyda that I want to put into this piece of land. The technique is occasionally calledGaldra and a nice old example of it can be found in Grógaldra in the Older Poetic Eddain where the dead Trollkvinna, Groa, having been summoned by her son to give himadvice and protection states:... á jarðföstum steini... on an earthbound rockstóð ek innan duraI stood indoorsmeðan ek þér galdra gó.while i sang the Galder for you.In more recent times this way of singing or shouting is called kula and has been in useby herders as a way to communicate over long distances.So I climb up the Unlausan rock, make my usual simple statement:Så långt som dessa skrik hörs, så långt bort ska allt ont stanna och stå.As far as these cries are heard, as far away shall all evil stay and remain.Then I unleash my Galder scream in each direction three times.My screaming seems to have scared the shit out of a dog who barks like crazy in oneof the apartments nearby, as well as a Chinese lady carrying grocery bags walkingacross the small street. She looks at me like she thought I was a skinhead on meth andhurries along. Somehow I always find that a bit amusing.Then I re-enter the apartment of my clients and add the dirt taken from the fourcorners inside their threshold. Similar to the many other techniques, this traditional"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"method of protection goes back to the old legal procedures. Dirt from all corners of thehouse was used as a token of ownership. The importance of the threshold or doorposthas similar roots. If there was no Ting to be held, all vows and legal transactions tookplace while holding the doorpost and standing on the threshold. When called to the Tingthe issue at hand was first proclaimed by the bedpost, then the threshold then at the Tingitself (held at a crossroad, by Unlausan stones etc.), so these places occur in manyTrolldom procedures and works.Once the dirt is in place the door to the apartment is closed and the couple is giventhe signal that the silence can now be broken. The small stone, that their new tomteattached itself to, is placed behind the stove in their kitchen and the couple are told thatthey now have someone protecting the house and themselves in the spirit realm. Theymust give him some beer and porridge once a year, at Christmas, and it is veryimportant that they do not forget to do so if they don't want even more trouble in thehouse. If they move, they should say this out loud and ask if their protector wants tofollow. He may or may not and they should not force him. I am well aware that merely‘protector’ is not really the right description for the functions of the Tomte, but Ifigured it will assist in making the couple serious about their promise and the payment.I could tell them to give a little something to their Vards, who are actually moreappropriate in terms of protection, on a regular basis as well, but I don't. They have gotenough on their minds right now and what I did should be more than enough to keepthat envious woman and most other crap away from this couple. So I take my fee, whichis traditionally quite substantial in order to add to the value of what has been done andthus it will reinforce the strength of it all through the couple's beliefs as well as to keeppeople like me continuing our traditional practice, and we said our goodbyes.Once outside I thank the spirits and the creator for allowing me to do all this and thenI leave. Another day is at its end and it is time for dinner. On my way out I see thatChinese lady looking at me from a window on the second floor. Her eyes still lookscared, but they have that look of knowing that something else took place here todaythat she somehow recognizes but can't consciously place. I reward her with aconfirming smile. Now she knows. The question is if she dares to incorporate it into herreality? This is after all Sweden. Swedes do not do these kinds of things. Or at least shemight have thought so. Until now.

This oldterritory was a land of hills, mountains and rivers in which many nationsthrived and disappeared. Empires were born and found their destruction here.It was here that the East Roman Empire was formed and developed into thepowerful Byzantine Empire which played a significant role in the formation of covenstructures in the Southeast of Europe. Today the Balkan peninsula is divided into manycountries, including Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Monte Negro,Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and Turkey. Traditional witchcraft inthis region is a product of the cultural heritage of various nations. Those nations wereIllyrians, Thracians, Dacians, Paeones and later Celts, Romans, Slavs and Turks. Wars,migrations and trade resulted in a mixing of genes and cultures, with Greece being ofpredominant importance.Arriving in the 6th century, the South Slavs became the dominant nation. When theycame to the Balkans they did not have a polytheistic pantheon or a developed paganism,but something that anthropologists call a developed demonology. This is understood tobe a system of folk beliefs which anteceded paganism and polytheism. The South Slavssettled only shortly before Christianity overshadowed the region. Because of this, theynever had the opportunity to develop their pagan beliefs onto another level. Theirreligious system was an amalgam of animism and the cult of ancestors. They believedin spirits of nature, spirits of fate and death, superior forces, demons, et al. Their basicmethodology and religious practices were based on folk magic and shamanistic rites.However, traditional witchcraft took shape during the Middle Ages under the influenceof the Balkan Gnostic sect known as the Bogomils. The system itself had become amixture of old folk magic, demonology, traditional medicine, herbal knowledge andheretical Christianity with shamanic methodology informing their ritual practice.We can divide the Gnostics into three basic groups, those who lived before Christ,those who lived during the first centuries after Christ, and the third group whocoalesced in the Middle Ages. It is important to note that this third group was formedupon European soil, and would spread their teachings through large parts of Europe.They became a rival to the nascent European Churches. However, the politicalstructures of states helped them to be victorious when confronted with the Gnosticsects. The most well known Gnostics groups from this period were the Bogomils, thePaulicians and the Cathars.For my story, the most interesting group is the Bogomils. By official reckoning, theysurfaced in Bulgaria somewhere between 927 and 970. But this is incorrect. At that time"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"many of the Balkan countries were parts of the Bulgarian Empire. The truth is that theBogomils were formed in the country known today as the Former Yugoslavian Republicof Macedonia. The founder of the movement was a priest by the name of Bogomil whostarted preaching around 950 somewhere between the towns Veles and Prilep. Whetherhe was an historical person or a mythical one we will never know for certain.The teachings of Bogomil spread quickly, in two directions. It spread over Bulgaria,Serbia, Bosnia and the region of Dalmatia in present day Croatia. From here it wouldmove East and enter Russia, and West into Europe. Once in Western EuropeBogomilism would yet again fork. One faction went through East-Bulgaria, Serbia,Bosnia, Dalmatia, Italy and France. The other faction spread through West-Bulgaria,Serbia, Hungary and on to France. From France the movement spread to Southern Spainand upwards to the British Isles.The teachings of Bogomil were a mixture of Indo-European beliefs fused with pagan,Christian and Gnostics ideas. They were local patriots and did not wish to speak Latinor Greek, nor adopt Christian Byzantine names, instead insisting on preserving the oldnames and terms native to them. Because of their patriotism they preserved folk beliefs,magic, rituals and folk festivals. Their accusers give a sense of this, Sinodic of Borilawriting that the Bogomils were:Those who in month in June on 21th day, the day when St. John the Baptist wasborn, do magic and pick plants; and on that night do mysteries like Hellenic rites,say that Satan created all things, and those who with kumirs call up rain and greetall things that come from the Earth.The historian P. Kemp has concluded that Bogomilian doctrine has influenced people indramatic ways, and in particular all the beliefs and doctrines in the Balkans. In theBalkans at that time shamanistic practice was very much alive. Shamans were in everyvillage. Their most important obligation was to give their community medicine andmagical help. They were healers, herbalists, clairvoyants and fighters against unnaturalcreatures, demons and the weather. Besides that, they were keepers of folk beliefs,myths, knowledge and wisdom. However, the state, motivated by the Church, wouldcome to call them warlocks and witches.Bogomils would incorporate all forms of useful beliefs in their own teachings, andmany of their books and texts are preserved for us, even today. In the Balkans thesebooks are known as knjige starostavne, the ancient books. They are full of magicalformulæ and rituals, exorcisms, healing rites, prayers, divination methods, astrologyand so forth. Furthermore, we know that Bogomils didn't pay taxes and refused labour.Instead they worked as healers, herbalists, clairvoyants and witchdoctors. They tradedtheir services for food, animals, clothes or what they needed.In the Balkans the medieval Byzantine government and Church started to call them"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"babajci, which means people who follow grandmother's religion; this was simplyanother term for witchcraft. In the Balkans it was mainly old women who were shamansand it was these old wise-women who were keepers of the treasure of folk beliefs andmagic.Roughly a third of the Balkan population would come to accept the Bogomil doctrine,since it did not conflict with their old beliefs, but rather continued them. The Bogomildoctrine did not result in accusations or hunts for heretics; they did not imposeobedience, slavery or enormous taxes. Folk shamans, witchdoctors, healers andherbalists would find in it what they always searched for, namely, safety; a religioussystem that didn't deviate from their own, but offered easily incorporable novelties.Bogomilism was ultimately a path to freedom, a way of surviving by working with whatthey knew best, without the Tsar, Church and Government dictating the shape of theirlives.Bogomils would gladly and willingly share their knowledge, techniques of healing,teachings about healing and magical herbs, and many methods of working, that werebased on pure shamanism. Shamanism was present in Europe for many centuries,especially in the Mediterranean. The good part of this Gnostic shamanism is what wascalled witchcraft and it is still present in some rural parts of Southeast Europe and theBalkans. These people, mainly very old, still exist. The best examples can be found inEastern Serbia, Western Bosnia and the littoral parts of Croatia. All of this is describedin my book The Last European Shaman.Shamanism cannot be summarized in a few words. The first problem is that mostpeople think that it exclusively exists in Eastern lands, amongst Indians and Siberians,or is something found only in Africa or Latin America. The other problem is that theterm largely refers to various techniques of entering trance and astral flight. However,shamanism is a part of the European cultural heritage and it also brings with it manyother elements, including working with trance states, which help us to define the natureof shamanism more precisely and thus exclude what is not shamanism from the term. Itis the focus on entering states of trance with the help of dance, herbs and mantras thatwould define the first stone on the path of traditional witchcraft in these regions. Theelements that together form shamanistic practice are found in many traditions, and theyare as follows: Performing rituals after midnight when the worlds of the living and the deadcollide. Perfoming rituals at three and fourway crossroads, because they are the placewhere worlds meet. Performing rituals at holy places such as forges, mills, bridges and powerful placesin nature.The use of special implements such as cauldrons, consecrated knives, magical"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" wands, crystals and stones. The use of healing and magical herbs by oral consumption, the making of oils andthe use of amulets. The use of masks and special vestments. Being possessed by animal forms during astral flights. The use of ritual nudity and orgiastic celebrations, something that originated withfertility cults and was continued amongst ‘witches.’ The second stone of traditional witchcraft in these regions was lent by the Bogomils,and it would give to the Balkans something that would differentiate this witchcraft fromother crafts: the influence of Gnostic Christianity and its doctrines.It is necessary to understand that the Bogomils were not in any way a group that wouldblindly cling to dogma. Although they had a common basic doctrine, it differed fromregion to region, depending on how the groups lived and the influence of local beliefsand religious practices. However, as influence goes both ways, it is interesting towonder what influence Bogomils had on folk shamans, and how they directly affectedthe formation of what we call traditional witchcraft in this part of Europe today.Scholars define the Bogomils as dualists, but we cannot be sure that dualism is theright word for their central beliefs. To better understand what they believed, it isimportant to understand that they embraced Byzantine vocabulary in their speech. Attheir core was the belief in two worlds, the material world and the immaterial world.The world that was immaterial is the Heavenly kingdom that belongs to God, and theworld they called the Earthly kingdom belonged to Sataniel, God's double in the worldof matter and men. One day God became aware of his shadow. Feeling lonely, he mademagical gestures with his fingers, crossing the shadow, and it came to life. That washow Sataniel was born. He was nothing other than God's shadow; in other words,another side of God. However, Sataniel grown bored in the heavenly kingdom, decidedto usurp the power of God and sat upon his throne. God punished him by sending him tothe Earthly kingdom, to rule on Earth and not in Heaven. It is important to understandhere that the phrase heavenly kingdom describes the existence of an immaterial world,whereas the earthly kingdom implies all that is material in the universe. The Bogomilsimplied, using Byzantine terminology, that there are in fact two important kingdomsand two important rulers: the Tsar in Heaven and the Tsar on Earth. The people had noproblem in accepting this, as it agreed almost entirely with their old beliefs. In Serbia,for example, Vid was the God of heaven and Dabog the God of matter, death and theunderworld.Bogomils believed that the God who ruled in Heaven could not have anything to dowith the material world. Just like Buddhists, they upheld the thesis that life is suffering."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"They believed that there was no hell after death, but that hell was the material world andmaterial existence. As a result, ruling that world, on his throne, sits Sataniel, the masterof all occurrences, good and bad; while God in heaven, the immaterial world, has noinfluence on people, their lives or spiritual growth. He could be reached only throughSataniel, the guardian of the gate and master of death who would enable one to passthrough.This is why, to them, nothing was important; neither kings nor states, neither State norChurch laws, neither sexual restraint nor acquiring material goods. Following this logic,the Bogomils came to formulate the biggest heresy, the one which would eventuallycause their tribulation. In their belief, Christ could not have been the son of Godbecause he was in the material world, otherwise known as Hell, and by that logic hewould have to have been Sataniel's son, or the Devil. This perspective on Christianity ispresent even today in Eastern Serbia, and I have encountered it myself aroundMajdanpek.This view of the spiritual world, anarchism and sexual freedom also incorporatedmany folk beliefs and methods, which would bring the Bogomils to set the final stone inthe path of traditional witchcraft in these regions. Bogomils refused to differentiatebetween men and women. Bodies were irrelevant to them, because they were made frommatter, so gender was irrelevant. In their belief system all genders are in same positionbecause all of them are in hell and hell is the material world. We don't need toemphasize how tremendous a sin this was in the Middle Ages and in the eyes of theChurch. However, that didn't stop them from going one step further. They organizedtheir groups by the old rules of ‘one God and twelve members’ or, one leader of aprocession and twelve participants. Simply put, this basic coven structure has its rootsin Christianity. Of course, the coven of thirteen members is one of the most usualformats and it has its origin in Christian mythology and the story of Jesus and histwelve apostles. Though coven structure has it origin in Christian mythology its rootsrun deeper into much older Gnosticism. In its early period, one group of Gnosticsadopted the idea that Jehovah has thirteen virtues from the Hebrew's religion. Wepresume that this model was applied when a myth about God (or more properly hisemanation on Earth) and twelve followers was created. Before Christ was born we hadtwelve signs of the Zodiac and the Sun in the middle of the system, which gives us thenumber thirteen again. This kind of organization of groups was nothing new. What wasdifferent with the Bogomils is that women were included in these groups. Women,furthermore, could lead certain rituals. So, imagine a group of thirteen people, men andwomen both, performing a ritual at the crossroads after midnight, perhaps naked andmasked; it would look very much like a traditional coven, would it not?Because of this, I believe there was a precise moment when the first coven structures of"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"thirteen members was formed, as well as the basic systems of traditional witchcraftwhich we can still recognize today. Real traditional witchcraft is an amalgam of archaicshamanism, folk paganism and, crucially, Gnosticism. There was a moment whenspiritual elements were incorporated into the craft as well as spiritual goals and this canonly be due to the Gnostic influence. This for me is the moment when traditionalwitchcraft was born.To make myself clear, there was not some central and dogmatic witch cult whichwould occupy the whole of Europe. That is what European ‘Gnostic’ groups would do,and they would be called witches’ covens, firstly by people and then by Churches andgovernments. They would have many differences, but the basic structures are madefrom two pillars: folk magic and belief systems on one side, and Gnostic Christianity onthe other which would give a final result, something that would come to be recognisedas traditional witchcraft. I believe this medieval Gnosticism spread across Europe andbrought with it the classical coven structure of thirteen members, with its other beliefsvarying from one country to another.The first groups to be persecuted were from Orleans in France in 1022 and Verona,Italy in 1175. During the reign of King Nemanja in Serbia, one third of the populationwas killed or banished from the country for being Bogomil heretics. Bogomils have notsurvived in history, though some of their proverbs, such as when things go bad light onecandle for God, but two for the Devil, are still popular. However, traditional witchcraftwhich formed under their influence has survived, in rural regions of the Balkans. As anexample I will use Serbia, because the most precise data we have is from that territory.All witches in the Balkans are solitary. However, all of them are members of non-organized cults from specific regions of the country. There are several types of ritualsthat witches from one region of the country perform together. Some of those rituals arepublic and witches perform them together with other members of the community, whileothers are performed only in specific situations. On both these occasions, witches (maleand female) form something like a coven which they call The Court. If the members ofthe court are only witches then they choose who will be the leader of the ritual. If thatperson is a man, he gets the title Tsar, if the leader is a woman she is titled Empress.Other men will be Kings and other women will be Queens. This is how the ByzantineEmpire was arranged. One Tsar and one Empress ruled the whole empire, whichincluded many smaller countries, each with their own Kings and Queens. In Bogomilthought there could be only one Tsar on Earth and one in Heaven. Rulers of thecountries could be Kings and Queens only, nothing more.The basic ritual structure would involve the Tsar and the Empress, followed by otherwitches, Kings and Queens, and finally the rest of the population, who would be CourtGentlemen or Court Ladies. For some specific rites there were additional roles and titleslike Sabre man, Bagpipe man or Singer. To illustrate this further I will give an example.During the Christian holiday Duhovi, which overlaps with the holiday of the village"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Duboka, people gather in front of the deep cave at the source of the Duboka river toperform a ritual that includes the whole community. Here the witches fall into trance;these women are called rusalje, which means the falling women. The rite starts byparading to the wooden cross (most often made of oak) and offering a sacrifice of foodand drink, after which rites dedicated to the dead are performed. People would start todance kolo accompanied by deafening music, and the dance would last until completeexhaustion with the Rusalje fainting, shivering and falling with piercing cries. Thismarked the entry into the trance. They would clench, scream, sing and talk, whichwould show that spirits of the dead were in them and communicating to them, or thatthey were pulled out of their bodies by fairies who took them away. There were severalways to be brought back from the trance. One was to be sprinkled with chewed upartemisia absinthium mixed with garlic and vinegar, another was to be sprinkled withriver water that was poured over a sabre. While a person was in trance there would bethree girls in dresses named Queens, three men with sabres named Kings and a bagpiperdancing around them. This holy day is celebrated in the entire Balkan territory, but theritual trance has only been preserved in this area of Eastern Serbia.A slightly different ritual with the same name was enacted by Queens in other partsof Serbia, also performed during the Spirits’ holiday, on Saint Nikolas’ or SaintGeorge's day. For that ritual people would chose one Queen, two Kings, one Court Ladyand four female Singers. They would dance a lunar dance, turning to the left andsinging, and they would visit all the houses in the village. Their intention was to bringfertility to people's homes.Certain rituals are performed only in specific situations. In 1908 in the village ofVeliki Izvor there was a great drought. Local residents thought that the drought wascaused by the Dragon that resided in their area. They believed that their village wasvisited by the Dragon at night because of his liaisons with some of the women, andbecause of its flights clouds could not assemble over the village, and therefore no rainfell. In order to remedy this, some of the farmers suggested that the vrzino kolo (afrenetic dance of witches or fairies) must be danced to drive away the Dragon, as themost powerful ritual was needed to counter such a powerful creature.The ritual was performed after midnight on the 21st of July. Around fifty villagersgathered at the graveyard and lit a big fire. The leader of the rite was elected, named asthe Tsar and he took off his clothes, while other people followed him. Then they joinedtheir hands and began to dance around the fire. This frantic dance lasted until thedancers’ exhaustion caused them to fall into a trance. During the dance there was notalking, so if someone wanted to say something he would communicate by mime ormumbling. When they determined that the dancing was complete, people ran throughthe village banging bells and pots. This race represented them chasing the Dragontowards the graveyard, to the big fire. When they drove the Dragon into the fire, theyjoined their hands and once more started to dance until the Tsar ruled that it was"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"complete.When Svetislav Prvanovic related this event in his article Our Ancient Superstitionsand Customs, he did not mention if the man who was elected Tsar was a witch, but weknow that he would have been. The reason is clear. The persons elected to be Tsar orEmpress would be keepers of traditions, rituals and knowledge and the only ones whowould know which ritual was the best for that occasion, and how it should beperformed.From all of this evidence we can describe what The Court would look like andexplain who plays which role. Of course, in most cases the form of the Witch's Courtdepended upon the reason for its formation and the ritual being performed. As we haveseen, all witches in Serbia are solitary. If they are female they are Queens and if theyare male they are Kings. Only in group work was one particular witch elected asEmpress or Tsar. The leader's obligation would be to choose the appropriate ritual forthat occasion and to lead the ritual giving directions to the participants. Other witcheswere Queens and Kings. Their obligation would be to perform whatever tasks the Tsaror the Empress gave them. The common people would be Ladies or Gentlemen of theCourt and would not usually perform ritual per se but would dance, sing or play onmusical instruments. Sabre men could be participants in ritual and were usuallyguardians. If a witch is in trance they would stand over her brandishing a sabre over herbody, so that some other entity could not possess it. Besides that, he could facilitate aritual return of the witch into her body as I have already described, by pouring amacerated herbal or river water over the sabre's blade and onto her face. The bagpiper'sobligation is to play music; when the trance is induced, this could last for hours. Thesinger would be one or more young girls. Their obligation would be to sing the ritualsong.What we know for certain is that the origin of this structure is not to be found in folkpaganism or shamanism, although ethnologists point out that in most Europeancountries nature spirits commonly had titles such as Queen and King. My opinion is thatwe should look for the origin at the time when Serbian traditional witchcraft wasformed – the Middle Ages. At that time Serbia was part of the Byzantine Empire andthe Empire had several kingdoms. So the ruler was Tsar but every kingdom had its ownKing. All of those kings were under the authority of the Tsar. That was very much likethe Witches’ Court – but this arrangement is just one aspect of the origin; the other lieswith the Bogomils.The Bogomils were using similar vocabulary for titles in their belief system andmythology. For them there is the Tsar in Heaven (God of the immaterial universe) andthe Tsar on Earth (God of the material world and the underworld) and in many mythsthe Tsar on Earth was mentioned as a ruler of three kingdoms (underworld, water andthe earth itself). We know through these myths that he granted hidden knowledge andmagical power. His consort, Maria, is very similar in this respect."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Our conclusion might be that a witch who is appointed Tsar or Empress wouldactually take the role of God on Earth or his Lady. We presume that all who are underhis or her command become Kings or Queens because he or his consort were forces thatinitiated those witches, gave them magical knowledge and the power to implement thatknowledge. So, the Court of the Witches is actually a Court of God on the Earth(Sataniel), while titles represent the position in the Tsar's castle and the castle itselfrepresents the material world – or Hell, if you prefer the Bogomil term."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"But to Assist The Soul's Interior RevolutionTHE ART OF ANDREW CHUMBLEY, THE CULT OF THE DIVINE ARTIST, AND ASPECTS OF SABBATIC CRAFTArt is magic or there is no art.Louis CattiauxHE ART BORN OF MAGICAL PRACTICE expresses secret iconography. It is anopening to what we cannot quite see. It is this mysterious realm whichunderlies the drawings of Andrew Chumbley who expressed the concept ofthe Cult of the Divine Artist by conveying his gnostic intentions throughcreative artistic expression. He chose to access what he termed Divine Imagination, aplace of space/time/intention similar to Henri Corbin's Mundus Imaginalis. Chumbleydescribed his working group, the Cultus Sabbati as a representation of the Sabbatictradition that expressed inner qualities of the tradition through artistic and textualexpression using this Divine Imagination.Creativity can be a form of magical soul making, or aesthesis. As explained by Plato,aesthesis may be viewed as a sort of imitation of imitation in that the artist's vision thatis expressed through the creative act can be a personal expression of the original intentbrought forth in order to express that intent to others. Veils are created indiscriminatelythrough the artist's expression, though the images will have an effect upon the image-maker whether the intent is communicated to the viewer, or not. Plato's idea is bestserved when the sorcerer is representing an idea as a goal of the product, rather thansimply representing his impression. The image may therefore represent spirit broughtinto matter, or Logos.According to Gettings, breath and spirit is reflective of Logos. Logos is animate, andart derived from gnosis is representative of Alogos, or the pre-animate, arising fromOther, wherein dwells the Divine Imagination. It is the imaginal space. We may thenask ourselves which is the most valuable image; the raw image that may be closer to the‘truth’ or the refined image that represents a conclusion? Art has magical power: it isperception/ingress, experience/congress, and insight/egress, differentiation. As such thefunction of the divine artist is the representation of gnosis as egress and manifesting itsymbolically within our realm.There has always been a sense of the sacred in artistic creation where the doing is asimportant as the finished image. It matters not whether the image is naturalistic orimmaterial; all images are symbols. If the image is a true representation of the essence,the numinous manifestation of the information imparted through ritual egress, the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"image, as the key expression of an idea, is a numinosum. The image sparks an enactmentof magical interaction, whether conscious or not, creating a significant transformation.This is the magical circle of return wherein all who participate in the art, from sorcererand spirit, to the viewer, form an indivisible circle in the magical process.The quality of sacred art is set aside from the mundane through intention. Chumbleyproposed through his art that art can bring forth catharsis when used as a tool of magicalpractice. It is a transformation or initiation. The artist is only the purveyor of beauty,not the master of beauty, which remains absolute and inviolate. Something may emergethat indicates further shaping within the sorcerer through Will, Desire and Belief but itis appertained through the artistic image that appears to express more than theaccompanying text. The imagery demands that its needs be met through manifestation.Chumbley's art depicted his sorcerous inquiry into the roots of Sabbatic Craftformulated by the sorcerers who preceded him, notably Austin Osman Spare and RobertCochrane. He expressed a rhythmic cosmos outside the perceptions of the group hecalled the clay, the everyday people who lived mundane lives unaware of such sorcerousinvestigations. He delved artistically into a prehistoric, mythical consciousness with themimetic conveyance of values and ideas. His was the metaphor of nature as primaryground, the incorporation of the past into the present, the future as now, gnostic angelicwhispering, and the implementation of rituals of eternal return. Unlike some of the Sufiprecepts gleaned from his reading of Henry Corbin and Idries Shah, his Gnostic intentdid not participate in the dichotomy that divides experience into good and evil, eternaland temporal, rather, it belongs to a syncretic system that accepts multiple truths andmeanings and attempts to reconcile them. For Chumbley gnosis was not achievablethrough a rational process. The mythic man, as John Cobb Jr. has explained, does notrecognize the separateness of subject and object but instead sees a flow of subjectiveand objective contributions ... bound together where there is no clear consciousness ofsubject as subject or object as object.There is an innocence of form that belies the deeper meaning of Chumbley's images.While these images look like they are fractured forms or abstract art, they are meant toportray not only a concept, but are a representation of what was seen. They arerhetorical renderings rather than aesthetic renderings. They are maps of the realitywithin a gnostic context; pictures of accessed image systems drawn from spirit. Whatwe see are symbolic structures of knowledge within symbol, which can't readily be seenas logos figures, but might be appertained as alogos figures, expressing knowledgegained through magical access through dreaming. Missing from these images is a key tothe information gained, save only for the bare outline of practice.Expressing a rare sacred geography that consists of a complex knowledge of placeand sacred terrain, embedded in a phenology of seasonal cycles and expressed magicaldoctrine, Chumbley's art dances close to the earth an intricate configuration of sacredassociations with the spirits of time and place within their particular landscape. Time"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"and space as well as sorcerer, spirits, all life and non-living matter forms a continuumthat relates to themes of fertility, death and rebirth, and the sacredness of all things.Chumbley forged a practice with inspiration from early and mid-century occultistsand from reading materials of traditional magical practice which he then termedSabbatic Craft. Though he took the traditional path of declaring that the term is only theouter shell of understanding of what he did, this has become the name by which hispersonal way of working sorcery has become known.Breaking onto the magical scene with his well received self-published grimoireAzoetia in 1992, Chumbley reintroduced the idea of magical practitioner as divine artistto the occult community. Building on the work of Austin Osman Spare whom he used asinspiration for his artistic style, Chumbley expressed through his art images of what hehad encountered whilst in the midst of ritual, and later in dreams. Calling his dreamimages gnosis from ritual, Chumbley drew fantastic visions that seemed to defymarkings of spatial continuity. He drew a representation of a mythic and supernaturalworld through his exploration of alternate consciousness that understood the sacrednature of this world. Not wish-fulfilling delusions, Chumbley's results would berepeated through his written grimoire work, and similar images might be attained byother sorcerers trailing behind, book in hand.Chumbley expressed in Azoetia that although it may seem as though the sorcerer haslittle power over the trajectory of the gnosis, it is true that only the sorcerer is thesource of creativity and has the transformative power necessary for the spirit to expressgnosis. If the sorcerer wants to succeed in the work of sorcery, he participates in thenecessary process of abandoning old programming. But how does this refer to art in amagical practice? Von Franz said: A civilization which has no creative people isdoomed ... The person who is really in touch with the future is the creative personality.In other words, sorcerers involved in the artistic process prepare the way for others tofollow and lay the pathway for a fuller understanding than simple words can convey.It is important to explain that the mapping of magical intent and gnostic expressionwithin the sorcerer's personal paradigm has both a deconstructive and constructivedimension: not opposites or in tandem as a duality, but as components in the processthat are ultimately complementary. The components in relationship are a key factor:one light and one dark without either being inevitable. What we believe we are viewingas objective reality, is discovered to be the subjective experience of spirit: the created isbeing created by being observed, and both are occurring simultaneously. Without amagical sense of perception, the sorcerer cannot enter the magical realm within the art.It is not a matter of trying to imitate an archaic spiritual practice or artistic style somuch as fostering psychic mobility: the sorcerer opening himself to a range of visionaryexperience in a modern culture whose contemporary beliefs have made the very idea ofother worlds almost unthinkable.Chumbley's art was an expression of divine prototype, a metaphor for the divine, not"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"a simile as is so often the case in contemporary occult art. A metaphor gives us a way todefine our own interpretation, and a simile expresses only the form. The form of simileis the clothed form of metaphor. Chumbley made his art more than simply an artisticexpression of his magical practice through his use of rites and incantation. He made theart more than anecdote as a substitute for meaning, by adding the mystery of his rites tothe process.Chumbley offers art with a strong talismanic quality that is not always a representationof something that may have meaning for others. This is why art taken from vision orexpressing a gnostic understanding may appear obtuse to the viewer. How are we toknow the difference between true and false, good and bad when viewing art born fromvision that does not provide references that we recognise?The imaginal quality of Chumbley's art expresses a fundamental expression of theother. It becomes an imitation, or mimesis of the imaginal world that bridges theliminal space, altering the imaginal so that we may in turn be transformed. Chumbley'sart becomes a mute performance, or silence. It allows distance between that whichexists and that which perceives. We don't consciously see, but we sense the meaningand character of the Imaginal. We experience aesthesis, or living in our senses.His art demands that the viewer explore his understanding of meaning and space asthe creative process is stirred, and whether meaning has been made or not, a response tothe original expression is created; a reciprocity is expressed and a return made. Theviewer then becomes a part of the loop, generating a continuum of devotion and gnosis. DREAMING, GNOSIS AND SYMBOL humbley studied many non-drug induced techniques for altering consciousnessin order to access his visions, such as Jain meditation, Spare's fatiguetechniques, the use of mala visualization, and practices from martial arts allaimed at accessing the gnosis from ritual, but the most success he found waswithin dream.Chumbley explored the concept of dream as initiation in his essay Mysticism,Initiation and Dream, writing: We might say that the dream transforms the dreamer,that it possesses the ability to ‘initiate.’ He later stated that dreams dictate how they areto be interpreted, in that the dream itself may be the author and meaning-maker.Many of Chumbley's art renderings were images from dream. The rational wakingmind is likely to dismiss an apparition as a visitor from a sorcerous operation or as anhallucination or illusion but to sorcerous dream consciousness it is totally, terrifyinglyreal. Chumbley wrote:It is related by Corbin that Ibn ’Arabi (1165–1240 CE) considered the true ta'wil –the hidden meaning of dreams – not to lie in interpreting the forms and symbols ofthe Imaginal realm in terms of worldly events, not in ‘reading’ the dream with"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"reference to ‘the order of sensible things and events,’ rather to accomplish the trueta'wil: ‘one must carry sensible forms back to imaginative forms and then rise tostill higher meanings.’ For Ibn ’Arabi this ascent path connotes a restoration inwhich the material world, ‘the visible temple,’ becomes identified with ‘themystical temple,’ and thus reified-translated to the spiritual order of perception.Miricea Eliade said that it is not enough, as it was a century ago, to discover and admirethe art of the primitives: we have to discover the sources of these arts in ourselves, sothat we can become aware of what it is in a modern existence that might still have a partof what is mythical. Chumbley created this expression of spirit, bringing aspiration intothe mix, which he expressed as an ascent to the stars after a descent into matter; areturn. One of the hallmarks of Chumbley's method is that it views everything as beingin process, either becoming or decaying, that even the unmoving center is moving in itssilence, that all entities are in flux. This is all in keeping with the ideas of modernscience, philosophy, and culture. In other words, anything that is real, whether known orunknown, is in process. He combines the Neoplatonic concept of oneness (that theultimate principle of the universe is single and undivided) with the Trinity, and in hisart shows the struggle to describe a perfect representation of Spirit through theimperfect medium of image and symbol. In Azoetia he expressed some measure of hisprocess of reification of his dream work in publishing two versions of the web ofpossibilities. One version is explained as dreamt and the other as reified from dream.One is imitative, and the other inventive through the interpretation brought to the art byChumbley. He lets us in on how he saw things as they are in themselves, bringinghimself to the work of sorcery as more than simply expressing what he rememberedfrom dream in his artwork. He showed in this how art may live in both the functional aswell as the spiritual realm, both within and without the sorcerer. As William Blakewrote: He who does not see more vividly and clearly than this perishing mortal eye cansee, does not see creatively at all.In dream myth is available to those who seek gnosis. Sorcerers access the magicaland sacred dimension which contains the past, present, and future. Visionary dream is aresponse against the literal mind; it is a movement towards a larger timeless dimensionthat is all time at all times. When we invite the object of spirit in the other world to joinus, the transformation of the personality becomes a living experience and we encountersomething that cannot be received on a waking basis or controlled by theorizing. Whenaccessing dream through sorcerous intent, ancient forms of consciousness begin toacquire an importance and meaning beyond the purely historical, as we discover themwithin our own psyche.Whereas science is based on the objective weighing of detail as fact, essentiallyseeing without imagination or artistic expression, myth is not fully understood unlessone enters into a circular, non-Cartesian state, such as dream. It is this melding with"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"spirit, or dissolution into a more encompassing identity other than the rationalized egoself, much like Jung's collective unconscious, that makes the gnosis retrievable forartistic rendering. Rituals and rites, structured fatigue, monotonous chanting,drumming, and repetitive movements are no longer an integral part of contemporarylife, but they are a way to make a direct hit on the dreaming aspect of the psyche.This dying to the world of rationality in sleep and dream whilst awakening topowerful archetypal forces in the visionary world of dream can be a treacherousbusiness. In dream when the ego-personality is temporarily displaced, the mindexperiences another world; this is Chumbley's Divine Imaginal world, where inside isnot separated from outside and spontaneous experiences of presences that do not belongto the ordinary world seem to occur. These are the images that Chumbley brought us asgnosis from his sorcerous workings. IMAGE AS DOORWAY TO RITUAL rtistic expression is a means through which the sorcerer may travel to otherplaces. The sacred image can act as a lure for spirits and as a means to accessalternate realities and states of consciousness, all of which may betransformative and used to obtain gnosis, leading to yet furthertransformations. The magical and mythological understandings of gnosis wrought fromritual that may be unacceptable to standard consciousness can be transcended via image.These other modes of reality-vision outside of the ego's control, visions that areessentially rooted in the soul that were abandoned by the rational and scientific logic ofthe enlightenment, may still be accessed via ritual.Coomaraswamy wrote of how the invisible things of God can be seen through art. Inprivate correspondence, Chumbley wrote: I am able to enter the immense fertility of thespirit world directly through my art. In rite as well as in sleep I cross over into a landfar older than my dreams, where I know ancestors and spirits of countless animals; allsecreting, weaving, digging, beckoning, expressing that the fundamental thesis of his artis the deliberate portrayal of divinity.Chumbley expressed meaningful transformation through expression within line in hisautomatic drawings, as did the artist who inspired him, Austin Osman Spare. He appearsto express the wish to banish from art everything that reminds us of the everydaycreating a tension that transgresses reality, projecting the artist and the observer intonew territory. Much like Spare's art, Chumbley's renderings reflect the wonder of whatAristotle saw as the origin of philosophy in an attempt through aesthetics to make thedistance between what we know and what we don't know absolute, and pointed.Chumbley and Spare ask us to step away from mimesis and identification of imagesto allow the stream to carry the intention in a purer form. Both discussed how automaticwriting and automatic art-making can be useful in understanding magical gnosis andconcepts. Both explained how the process is as important as the results, explaining that"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"the process trains the information one wants to explore to express its full power.Working outside of the logic of identity, we may see immediacy and distance fromintention. We may then begin to see the image as a vehicle that operates betweendualities allowing poesis as a form of knowing to express Chumbley's magical formulaof Ingress, Congress and Egress. GNOSIS IN THE ART PROCESS rt begins formless, much like the earth before it became shaped and populated;the time before time, or the time before meaning. As the artist begins, animpression is made on the material that creates art, and it then expresses itsmessage as the intention of the artist. Much like the sacrificial rites ofSabbatic Craft, in which the sorcerer sacrifices the old to birth the new, more perfectman, art is the unformed becoming the newly formed, from rite to re-membrance. Thereis a delineation of form within art that mimics the de-lineation of the sorcerer's formwithin the rite: the sorcerer becomes other, the mimicry of a god or spirit, and returnswith the gnosis as the resolved new man. The art from the rite is then a metaphor of theprocess; no longer a copy envisioned in a mirror as simile, but as a magicallytransformed act.How can subjective meanings become known objective reality? Or how may weexpress ritual activity as things? How indeed, for we must inquire into meaning-makingor the reality sui generis. Within the ritual process that envisions art as a resolution,something must happen to develop the metaphor from the simile, as Meister Eckhartsays: all her forms must be shattered. This idea is similar to that of Michelangeloclaiming that the image was in the stone and all he did was release it.Chumbley saw the definition of making meaning from gnosis gained through ritualmuch as Berger who wrote of meaning-making as a quality appertaining to phenomenathat we recognise as having a being independent of our own volition. Another level ofmeaning-making within culture is a theoretical expression that is informed by symbolicmeaning, referring to realities that are other than those we live in every day. Heremeaning-making is found within symbol that expresses a form of meaningfulintegration. In lower forms of legitimation only parts of the known construct ofmeaning in sorcerous inquiry is known, but at the higher level of meaning-makingcreating a specific all-encompassing cosmogony becomes the point, because when allvectors of meaning are included a space is created wherein everything happens withinthe sorcerer themself.Cosmological meaning-making is inherent within Sabbatic Craft and cannot be leftout of any study of Chumbley's artistic expressions. This world, this universe has timeincorporated in it, with a past and future as well as a ‘now.’ Everything becomes anexpression of the divine, including trespass against taboo and inanimate objects,allowing for them to be recognized and dealt with in a social manner. This provides an"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"order to the hierarchy of the universe, keeping the darker and more terrifying aspects ofinsanity at bay. The use of art as a way of meaning-making within the context ofmetaphor and symbol as an expression of the ‘rightness’ of reality fits into a sorcerouspractice that encompasses this kind of advanced cosmogony. A sorcerous artist liveswithin a whole world in his art that allows him to find his location in the symbolicuniverse.Any idea of sanity and the sorcerer as a sane, stable member of a contiguous societyis threatened by the ‘surrealistic’ congruence of dreams which finds the sorcerer as amember of the symbolic universe. Within many cultural myths, the sorcerer's real nameis given by the spirits allowing the sorcerer to anchor himself both within the cosmicreality of everyday life and the malevolent transmutations of the places betweeneveryday reality and cosmic reality. No matter what happens, he knows that the spiritsknow him. This incorporates a knowing that transcends every possible transmutation ofthe sorcerer within the symbolic cosmos. He may bring back images from that otherplace with impunity.An important factor within the legitimized symbolic art cosmogony for sorcerers isas Chumbley wrote, going to death. This knowledge of seeing the death of others pointsto the liminal space in gnostic dream and in symbol wherein the sorcerer mayincorporate death into life as part of their sorcery. The integration of death into life thenbecomes the most important symbolic expression within sorcery and is an oftenunacknowledged part of the artistic occult image. All death within sorcery must allowthe sorcerer to continue on with life after its embrace to continue the routine ofeveryday life. This may only be attained by integrating death into a symboliccosmogony. Slipping into death, and then returning, transcends the power of a symbolicuniverse. This symbolic cosmogony is expressed readily within Chumbley's art. ART-MAKING ithin a magical construct artistic creativity can be understood as a meaning-making vehicle to restore a form and balance to what we either wish to findand experience, or what we have experienced. The magical artisan looks for away to shape the experience grounded in image with a sensible immediacy,and art-making can give intention or experience form as something meaningful.Without the image the experience can fade fragment and become lost.The concept of making a mark to indicate an idea is an old one, and we may explorethe aspect of image as a metaphor for gnosis within a magical practice by looking moreclosely at how the development and ‘unfolding’ of image might artistically expressgnosis. When relating what we find and do in magical practice, how can we make senseof what we have experienced? Creating an image of what we have experienced is a wayof giving form to what we know and shaping the world we know in a new way.By experiencing what we see expressed through a magical act, and making meaning"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"of it through art, we are allowing it to show itself within the meaning that we give it, aswell as the meaning inferred. We have wonder that is made into meaning. Wonderdraws us into art but meaning is what we express from that art. Art-making as a magicalact aims to project the sorcerer into the world of Divine Imagination. We could thendescribe art making in a magical sense as a vehicle for restoring our connection to theOther.Post-modernists argue that concept has always overshadowed image in philosophicalthought. I would rather suggest that the image stands next to the concept, expressing theconcept in a way that bypasses our defenses, speaking to our deepest knowing. Whenevocation creates an image the sorcerer is dealing with a symbol. The meaning of thesymbol must be known to be understood by an observer, as something intrinsicallyknown; known without explanation. The magical nature of the symbolic egress cannotbe objective or objectifiable by its very nature, for objective art is exoteric, not esoteric.Esoteric art transcends the objective, for the nature of the art is synthesis. According toHeidegger: In Being and Time truth is understood not in the Platonic sense of mimesis,correspondence to a pre-existing reality, but as alethia, the remembering or uncoveringof what is hidden and needs to be brought into the open to be seen. Art does notrepresent gnosis and is not a copy of what we have experienced, instead it works totease silence from logos and bring it forth into our meaning making and understanding.Art arising from magical practice does not always imitate what is found in themundane, but instead brings into being what has arisen from Other, revealing the truthof what is. In this way a world is made from image; the spirit gnosis is shared with thesorcerer as artist and when the gnosis that strives to be known takes form in image, thesorcerer is as far from those who see the art as he is close to their fate. The sorcererexemplifies his original intent through his art. We are initiated through the imagemaking and through viewing the image. Sharing the image within the mundane world isa practice of seeing and the seen. Each informs the other and within that dance isinitiation. It is a recognition of a concept in historical time. It creates a re-vision of ourspirit within a moment. Each moment is its own history, an utterance of the directrevelation of the numinosum.Chumbley's art relies on axial existence within his sorcerous work. His thresholdcrossing within ritual towards the center of organization, Jasper's ashsenzeit, or axis atdeath, or what Cobb calls the seat of existence, moved from the unconscious images tohis conscious mind, and a new autonomy in the reflective consciousness effected aconnection to the mythical age, and by accessing mythical imagery he brought tofruition the metaphor of magical gnosis. A new individual understanding of the gnosisreceived arose from his artistic rendering. This enabled Chumbley to engage in artisticself-awareness, or awareness of the soul as an object of reflection, and to begin thinkingabout the nature of man, the purpose of life, and how to achieve the ideal embodimentof this soul."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Through gnostic artistic expression and in images gained through ritual, a new centeremerged that transcended reason and passion, and assumed responsibility for both. Thisnew awareness was expressed by Chumbley as I, and became the locus from whichritual and image were made and carried out. Chumbley called this the culmination ofWill, Desire and Belief, but as Cobb pointed out, it can be identified as such only from ahigher perspective that transcends but includes this axis of I.Although Chumbley wrote of being possessed by spirits as in being ridden by spiritsin creating some of his artwork, his emphasis was on a personally transformingencounter between the appertained spirit and the human personal spirit. Through his artand magical practice, Chumbley sought to transcend the personal I and realize thespiritual I in his artwork. By attempting this, Chumbley's art embodied and showed theway to radical self-transcendence. The possibilities expressed in Chumbley's art are thespiritual self and the self-transcending self wherein the possibilities for creativetransformation are far from exhausted. In looking at Chumbey's art we may note how heconformed to the formal, traditional and historical pattern of transcendence throughrite, but in referencing the art of his predecessors, such as Spare, he included theirachievements. Chumbley interwove the notion of self with the axial impress of rite inhis nod to the sorcerer artists who preceded him as an understanding of self as theunchanging object of change.Can what we do as artistic sorcerers allow us to be reborn through the creativeprocess? There is something in this work of sorcery that resists image even as we arriveat knowledge through image. The Divine Artist must discover how the image willbecome manifest. A necessary tension emerges within the initiated, the initiation andthe image.Art-making as a sorcerous activity can in and of itself be a transformative experience.Using the senses to see what has been brought forth creates a link between our worldand the world of Divine Imagination by becoming available to us even as it reverts tothe place from whence it came. The information is no longer with us, save for therepresentation, but the representation holds the seed of the gnostic intent. The world ofDivine Imagination can therefore be revealed through a work of art by giving a newsense to what we have appertained within our own magical practice.From a phenomenological perspective, all artistic expression must be known by itsappearance. There must be a subject behind an object, even if not perceived. The objectcannot exist without being appertained: the subject must be viewed in order to exist. Itis through aesthesis that the image becomes manifest.As an expression of the sacred, magicians and artists struggle to manifest conceptsthat defy mundane expression. Making art as a magical process can transform the artistas well as the viewer. The process of imitating that which resists imitation is the task ofthose drawn to the Cult of the Divine Artist, though the task remains fraught, we mustattempt it."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" BIBLIOGRAPHY ARGUELLES, J.

Ah, how hard it is to tell the nature of that wood, savage, dense and harsh –the very thought of it renews my fear!Dante Alighieri, The Divine ComedyStand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is,and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.Jeremiah VI:16IDDEN IN THE DARK FOREST OF EACH BREATH, there is a serpent-tongued roadthat offers the keys to heaven or hell; yet as quickly as this stang ofopportunity reveals itself, it is gone again – until the bottom of the nextbreath, wherein a new road presents itself, and another, and another ... This iswhere we meet him, the Man in Black, the Devil at the crossroads, the eyeson-the-roadof each potential choice. And he is always here, keys in hand, whether we realize it ornot. Revelation of his presence is only the beginning, for now that you know he is here,this horned Saint Peter, what now?There is no offering of arguments towards a mutual acceptance of this potential – it issimply here, always and never, flashing the temptation of choice in the dark flitter ofevery blink. It is here that the witch assumes her true power, it is here the Magus takesof the fruit of the first tree, watering it with the tears of his self-betrayal.

And it is here where, withhumility and awe, I find myself returning, trying to capture its smoke in the bottle ofmy memory.When the map fails, I must re-examine the landscape.

This seems based on the mistaken assumption that we must, by necessity,solipsistically combine all things, or compartmentalise to avoid any dissonance. Whilethe treading of multiple paths may not be right for some, for others, it can be used as atool to re-center the witch and provide forward momentum. There is an intense need tokeep these paths not only separate from each other, for the preservation of tradition andthe knowledge thereby gained, but also to allow them to work as a unified whole uponthe consciousness of the witch, with necessary doubt and the discipline of self-examination.In our larger mother-culture in the West, there is an absolutist precedent in religionand spirituality, where one-way, usually ‘our way,’ is the sole means by which to accessthe truth of God. But there are also worlds of thought where agglutinating pragmaticand myriad approaches is a natural expression and exploration of Divinity. This doesnot automatically allow for the immediate acceptance of falsehoods as legitimate, butrather allows for a plurality of expression and explorations of the self.Walking paths must be more than the collection of traditions for the satiation of theego. But, through discipline and the cultivation of attention, the mind can engage in thisby forging links and and deeper understanding based in comparisons and contrasts. Ifwe get too lost in the specific contradictions between paths, we are lost. But when weuse those same contradictions as explorations of a greater truth, our comprehension canblossom and provide new insights. Imagine these paths meeting, like spokes on a wheel.If we walk the perimeter of the wheel, we will be engaging in each path, but themomentum of the whole will throw us out of balance. Yet, if we can find our center,become the axis, then each tradition can still be engaged, but all will serve theverticality of the witch.For some, a plurality of languages is normal, and one does not preclude the other. Thesubtleties of speaking Spanish are different from those of English or Mandarin. Someseem to have an ability to master many languages, others struggle with one. It is abalance of hard work and something less definable; some call it a gift. It is the samewith the languages of spiritual paths. When we engage in this work of centering, thisdoes not mean that the nuances of traditions are blurred, nor are ‘all gods one god, andall goddesses one goddess.’Without the benefit of guidance from self or tutor, it becomes all too easy to indulgein whim and give in to momentary impulses that distract from potentialities that serve agreater trajectory. It becomes essential to weigh decisions, actions, and impulses"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"against their own opposites. This is the murderous blood of Cain, for the blood betraysitself, turning on itself, expressing enough doubt in the current situation, suggesting thatyou may want something different. This divine restlessness is the poison chalice thatpropels us, drives us, and turns impulses into fruit, venom into the wine-blood ofSalvation. Over time, we more quickly apprehend these moments and we are able tohasten our progress.Witchcraft is not a religion, it is an approach towards religion and belief, an impulseof rebellion born in desire for change. Witches can and will work within whateverreligious traditions serve them, whether out of cultural affiliation or adoptive practice.The right handed worship of deities and veneration of saints and the dead hastremendous power, but it is not witchcraft. It is the work in tandem with the left handedacquisition of the power of those same deities, saints and mighty dead for our own,where witchcraft lives. Do not let the right hand know what the left hand is doing – anappropriation and re-reading of Matthew VI:3.The secrets of rebellion and murder in traditional craft suffer gross misinterpretationby the right hand path. For the pious, to embrace the qualities of Lucifer and Cain is atbest an uncomfortable heresy. Equally mistaken is seeing the glorification of the sameas the capstone of achievement and communion. If we do not use these impulses, thisco-mingling of revolt and murderous resolve known as witchblood, for catharsis andtransformation, it is as indulgent as any other blind adherence to right hand practice.This cannot be counted as true witchcraft. For just as Cain accepted his punishment asthe properties of his actions and became the father of blood, so too did the Christ accepthis burden, assuming the role of sacrificial lamb for the sins of the world.Dual observance is ultimately about the intersection of orthodox and heresy, thewitch standing on the center-point of power. For such a witch, the right handed practice,grounded in more orthodox workings, revolves around using observances, prayers, andofferings as a point of ingress for harnessing the power that may be accessed in theheretical practice of the left hand.Just as the blood calls for the sacrifice of all that hinders the becoming of the witch,the left hand seizes the power of gods, spirits, saints and the mighty dead for their aidand use. Intercessor becomes mentor, and Saint and Devil merge in the fires ofcommunion, and the blood is vivified, reified, and strengthened. While not a universalaim, often such an accumulation of power is first sought as a means for the control ofthe mundanities of life; yet often it plants a seed of awareness, and all workings becomesubservient to the Nowl-Star of self understanding, the latter not eclipsing the utility ofthe former.There are examples of this mindset in many paths and disciplines. In traditionalastrology, an astrologer may know the lay of the heavens on any given day and interpretits significance and influence, but it is the art of the talisman, the harnessing ofauspicious stellar and planetary elections in corresponding and sympathetic media"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"where a similar ‘seizing of power’ happens. While a person may supplicate theplanetary angels through offerings of prayer and incense, an astrological talismanplaces the power of those same angels in the hands of the cunning one. This is a lessstigmatized version and analogous practice to our own work-with-both-hands.Consider the worship of saints. While many debate the use of saints in TraditionalCraft, both right hand and left hand workings with saints are practiced everywhereChristianity, especially Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, is encountered. Thehistory of many saints often reveals a State authorized seizure of power from other localcults. But we are not merely discussing the masking of pagan god as saint, as we find inmany Afro-Diasporic traditions. Dual-observance looks to the saints themselves as thevessel of all its manifestations, holding a mirror to the tradition their veneration asks:who is the mirror, and who is the mask? When the curandera prays to the Virgin ofGuadalupe, calling her Tonantzin, the saint is just as much the Mother of God as She isthe Mexican earth mother. This is true syncretism, where the dominant culture's spiritsconsume the less dominant, and fusion takes place. This is the serpent under the foot ofthe Virgin, the inclusion and command of the legion of spirits that are now collectivelyknown as saint. The question to be asked is how do we harness this serpent power?On December 13th, millions of Christians celebrate the Feast Day of Saint Lucy ofSyracuse, a virgin and martyr associated with festivals of light and with healing,particularly of the eyes. Lucy, whose name is derived from lux, Latin for light, is patronof the blind, and gives the promise and hope of seeing the rise of the Sun of God asSolstice and Christmas follow close behind. She holds her own eyes on a platter in herhands, removed as a punishment for, or as devotion to, her faith. The faithful makeofferings of flowers, candles, incense, and prayers seeking her intercession. With theright hand, this veneration is mostly benign, with possible links to pre-ChristianSolstice celebrations in Scandinavia and Italy. In Mexico, she is depicted as a little girldressed for her first communion, with a crown of thorns on her head, her eyes gougedout, blood dripping down her cheeks like tears. Many possess eyes on a small platter,held in their hands, that can be removed to ‘work the Saint,’ a form of folk-Catholicmagic that uses bargaining and coercion to force a desired action. In this case, her eyesare hidden from her until one's request is fulfilled, or conversely, her eyes can be placedsomewhere you need her to watch over.There is something telling in this depiction and practice, for it echoes another side ofthe Saint. Lucy, when worked with the left hand is a highly mischievous saint. She is a ayoung girl who enters riding the head of the dragon into the long night; she is the dyingof the light, and maybe she'll see us through to the coming of light on the other side inthe promise of Candlemas, as Lucifera, crowned with a wreath of candles. On her feastday, the cunning can seize power with both hands – offer a rosary to her, flowers,candles, incense; and just as the astrologer makes the talisman to seat the celestialpowers, the witch can create any number of vincula to seize the powers of the martyr"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Lucy for their own. Heating sympathetic herbs in oil while calling upon her, make an oilin her name, and while the oil is still boiling pour it over the idol of the Saint, capturingthe adorations of the right into the menstruum of the left. Let the oil be made only onher feast day, being sure to place eyes – actual or in effigy – within it, to seize the sight.This oleum can be applied to the eyes for health, or used as an unguent to instill secondsight and the eye of prophecy.We work with the right to know the Saint, we work with the left to steal their power.This is not an act of aggression – we are talking about raising the power of the right byutilizing a feast and worship as a means of harnessing that power on the left. Thedifference between the two is often born of differing attitudes at the intersection oforthodoxy and heresy. Within this vein is the left hand celebration of Good Friday,where the faithful seize the power of the Christ in the Harrowing of Hell, a practice withkindred manifestations, from the legends of the Pendle witches of Lancashire, theEaster Witches of Sweden, the Palo sects of Cuba, and Quimbanda in Brazil, amongstmany others. The fruits of such dual observance can manifest as a talisman, an oil, astatue, or even an empowerment from the spirit itself. And it is in this intersection ofmatter and spirit, and only here, that true initiation takes place.Initiation, to be genuine, requires a specific meeting of spirit and matter, wherewhether solely by spirit, or through the mediation of one already initiated, the force ofblood will impregnate the chosen candidate. This is to say that the stirring of the bloodthat is affected is itself a coagulation of spirit within the body that must then benurtured by the newly initiated. There must be a course of ingress for the novice, whichseems to be provided through two traditional means: either by time, trial and studybefore empowerment as preparation of the void field of reception, or by means of thesame after empowerment as incubation for that-which-has-been-received. An argumentcould be made that both happen naturally when spirit guides.Initiation is never a guarantee, and should never be held over another's head as areward. It should be given when it should be given, and only then, and at the discretionof its secret-keepers. It should also be noted that although solitary initiation is possibleat the hands of spirit, given this requirement, there is no form of self-initiation. Onecannot pass on to oneself what was not originally there. The curdling of the blood canindeed happen in isolation, but it is always and only at the hands of spirit, and this, truthbe told, is rare to find. When this happens there is no need for initiation in a group lestmutual affinity bring you to each other. What is given in recognition can never bedemanded.Initiation tends to manifest bonds of kinship tied in blood, and adoption into suchfamilies should not be given casually.

Each momentbecomes choice, and each choice leads us to the next intersection of what-needs-be withwhat-is. Here, in this fertile ground of opportunity, we find the scattered seeds of theforbidden tree. It is where we hear the hissing of the first serpent, that blind dragon,which offers us the poison chalice of our godhood.The blind dragon comes to each of us, whether as the slant serpent or the tortuous, towhisper of the potential of our own becoming. And here, if we are ready, we may sloughour skins and ascend the very same tree, seeking the balance of the Pole of verticality.Until we do so we are as beasts, like the serpent, with our bellies on the ground,confined by the gravity of the world and the siren song of the spreading earth.This ever-expanding pull of the black earth that calls us to live and die by the land,toiling to dig our fields by day and our graves by night, calls us to lay down insubmission to the natural order. While the same order nourishes us, it will destroy us, itis what we are made for. But in this submission, what do we sacrifice? Where is ourhumanity and the awareness of choice we have cultivated? This is the Mother of Lies.Do not get swallowed by her. While by the lie we live and die, in the lie we find proofof the incorruptible truth.The ascent up the tree is the assuming of a new burden – for in our ascent, in our spiralclimb, there is a new seduction, a new danger. It is the blood of the celestial serpents,those ancient angels, that again rebel within us. Here, where our ophidic nature meetsonce more with the eyes and ears of humanity, we are offered a new temptation. Strikeout and claim the tree for ourselves, or sprout the wings of flight, just as the tortuousserpent becomes the owl in the night.For high in the tree the serpent has transformed his axis, trading the horizon for thepull of zenith and nadir. It is at once the pole of the brazen serpent, the tree of Golgotha,and the gallows of Judas. It is a memory of the fall of the king, and radiates the luxsmaragdina of the cunning-race.

Through her, the restlessness of the blood becomes the wings weneed to understand our position and make our own fate. For the witch is not bound tothe dragons of horizon and apex, but to their own power to decide for themselves.In this fury of sabbatic flight, the crossroads crosses upon itself, multiplying,changing and shifting, opening worlds within worlds of possibility. This is the bloodacre of our becoming, made manifest through an internalisation and awareness of thecrossroads of each moment. Victory is fleeting and short won.

This is our benediction and execration.Come to know what is in front of you, and that which is hidden from you willbecome clear to you.Thomas V:1In the infinity of that crossroad of the Sabbat, we must always be moving forward, stepby step, through the mire of distraction and the mud of self-contentment. An attentionmust be cultivated that allows for the perceptions of inner and the sensory input ofouter, but the wayfarer must navigate between perceived objectivity and subjectivity,and away from the conflation of sensation and feeling.This is not meant to be solely confined to our perceptions of the Sabbat and theeternal crossroad. Or, alternately, the work of the Sabbat is all-encompassing, andshould pervade all aspects of our life. All is grist for the mill, all is fuel for the athanorof transformation. When we confine our craft to ritual alone, or to intellectual musings,we lose valuable opportunity for the cultivation of this awareness. All moments arefertile possiblities, and we must cultivate a relationship between our daily life and ourmagical praxes. If such awareness is absent or avoided, magic becomes at best fantasyand escapism and at worst posturing and charlatanry, all of which may be poisonedfurther by self-deceit.If our pace is too quick and it is to the detriment of the quality of our attention andawareness, a more measured pace can and should be sought. These rhythms will, withexperience and consistency, become more swift in process, but there will be moments,seemingly random, that pose great exceptions to this rule. Because it is all too easy tofall into looping frustration and cycles of judgement, we must look again at sensation"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"and perception.The blurring between the two is especially evident when we experience pain. Oftenthe sensation of pain brings a feeling of anger or sadness, and we give into the pain wefeel at that moment. We cede our potential, our humanity, to the sensation of pain, and,in that moment, we are lost. However, when we first observe, not experience, our pain,the act of observing places a distance between sensation and feeling. In this intersectionwe find the potential for increasing levels of observation that place the pain in a largercontext. With this new information, more paths of action open. We release ourselves ingreater degrees from the bondage of our mislabeled sensations. This is again the flightof the witch mother, the double edged knife of vantage.These concentric circles of awareness are not unlike the ritual circles of our arte.While the circles, physical or projected, that delineate different fields of working andspheres of awareness in our rites and associated cosmologies are a cherished part of ourrepertoire, it is ultimately that which surrounds the mind of each witch that is of themost value. The degree of permeability or resilience we assign them allows us to walkin the world between the extremes of exposure and isolation. Just as we must endeavorat each crossroads to re-examine the inner needs of our path, we must keep attention tothe outer that we do not get lost inside ourselves.The circle's edge hums with sound, yet, in the hendekate direction of center, the Treeof Knowledge grows in silence. Here we may observe the workings of our dual worlds,inner and outer, with less distraction. Here we can re-evaluate our station, and ourperception. Here we return to the body for the benefits of sensation as informationseparate from feeling. For when we can examine the inner world with greater alacrity,the outer world will also reveal itself. This is the gift of the Tree of Knowledge, as herewe gain vantage in silence on the wings of the owl.It is here we meet ourselves before walking into the world; at the crossroads, in theshade of the tree wizened with age and blasted by the jealousy of God, where the owl-as-serpent became mother of the blood. The blood awakens within us a crossroad ofrebellion and murder, inviting us to a dream state of two-headed possession wheresensation informs, but does not rule; where heresy meets the mirror-mask of orthodoxy;where spirit and matter intersect; where shouts of we unify in the silence of I; wherechoice and awareness merge.The keys are ours for the taking. This is the promise, the rock upon which we build,that awareness and choice increase with attention on the same. In each moment is theopportunity to enter heaven or hell, and in that moment, at the center of the crossroad,the witch assumes both blessing and curse as the crossroad incarnate; to walk throughthe world, but be not of it.

Bone collector, bone washer, animalnecromancer, deathwalker, shapeshifter, poisoner, witch... these are the words peoplewhisper of me and my practices. Some whisper with fear and others with desire. I am ananimist, a folk magician, and a rootworker. It is not just herbs I work with in my folkmagic, but also skulls and bones, hearts and tongues. I practice the lost art of workingwith beast, blood, and bone in order to rebirth the ancient nature of Witch as a wild andprimal creature; surrounded by spirits, anointed with blood, dressed in hides, andadorned with talismans of bone, tooth, and claw.The magic of beasts is sympathetic magic, fetiche magic, and death magic, but it isalso sensual magic. It is the feel of the Saturn finger dipped in warm blood, of softestfur on barest skin, of sharpest tooth and talon biting in, of a raw heart on the tongue, andthe scent of decay deep in the lungs. It is the rendered fat of a flying ointment likesmooth silk across the brow, and it is the tactile, dirty, grounding sorcery of the hereand now. It is an amoral, carnal, fleshly, and sensory feast of visceral magic combiningthe sacred and the profane. The magic of beasts belongs to the wild sorcerers who arepart human, part spirit, and part animal; the ones who dance the knife's edge betweenthe worlds of life and death, the incarnate and disincarnate.It is only practical to work with the animals and spirits who share the land where Ilive, for they have a closer relationship with me than any romanticized exotic animalsacross the sea.

On my altar are their antlers, horns, bones, skulls, teeth,hides and feathers. The ones I did not find myself ended up in my care through bonecollectors, shamans, and hunters.It is important to state that I do not kill the creatures who come to me; instead, they arebrought to me after death by conservation officers, hunters, taxidermists, and fromfriends as road kill.

We must approach ourMighty Dead in full knowledge they killed the swans buried in their sacrificial pits, theykilled the mare buried beneath the feasting hall, and they killed the hornless bull for itshide to wrap around their seer so he may dream of invaders’ ships.

Long will our descendants do so after we are dead.Death will show you a side of your character as yet unknown and your reaction willeither gladden you or horrify you. We are so far removed from death in our modern,sterile, clinical world that it is more important than ever as spirit workers to reconnectourselves and others with death, blood, and bone. I work with death so I can be close toit. Being close to death reminds me I too am a spirit, walking around in a suit of fleshwhich I may come and go from as I please.

Sympathetic magic takes this common phrase to a deeper level.To acquire the keen hearing, quick reflexes, and agility of a deer, one would eatvenison. To acquire keen eyesight or the ability to fly like a bird, crossing between theother worlds, one would eat poultry. Our ancestors believed to eat a thing is to absorbits powers, spirit, and knowledge into yourself to make you more powerful or wise. Tokill a thing is to take its spirit. Hunters of old would usually let the spirit go and returnthe bones of a fish to the river it was caught in and the bones of a deer to the forest of itsdeath as a sign of respect so the creature could be reborn again and eaten again.Not every animal was let go. Some animals were hunted solely for their spirits: fortheir hides, their bones, for their claws and teeth, for their power, and for their help asan ally, totem, or familiar. Such spirits are asked to willingly offer themselves and staywith you until it is your turn to die. Our ancestors asked permission, not merely of theanimal spirits themselves, but of the ruling genius loci, before they hunted or harvestedas is evidenced in the hunter's invocations in the Kalevala, ancient Latin spellspetitioning Artemis, and oral Scottish tales of disrespectful hunters being found dead,killed by a wild shape-shifting crone."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"When you bring home any part of an animal with the intention of enlivening it as afetiche, keep in mind that like any living creature you would have be your pet, you mustalso be responsible for any spirit you take home – you must accept its wildness andinstincts, sate its hunger and thirst, clean it when it becomes soiled, and give it of yourlove, your energy and your time.
