Progress on Volume Six, the Index - a vast undertaking in itself -will be described at the end of the present Introduction. Introductions normally come at the beginning of a work, whether a single volume or a series of volumes, but the need to finish the massive HOODOO work at all cost led me to put off writing the Introduction to the beginning of the final volume. The benefits of this plan are many, of course, not the least of which is the perspective I gained by working through all of the field material, and setting it down in final form. These reflections have proved invaluable to me in assessing what I was trying to do in an enterprise that claimed my attention - with interruptions - over a per­iod of many years. If the reader is unfamiliar with the preceding volumes, he should read the opening bracket-paragraph on page 3779 , which identifies the two speakers appearing everywhere - author and an informant being interviewed. Only in the Florida fieldwork of 1970, pages 4492-4754, are there three or more speakers. All this means that Volume Five, like the previous four volumes, is a collection of conversations depsite many separate short statements from broken­up interviews . For the bulk of the remainder of this Introduction, I should like to discuss some aspects of hoodoo fieldwork which are not sufficiently conveyed to the reader who has access only to the transcribed interviews and to my comments which comprise the maj or part of the text of HOODOO. Specifically, I am referring to the people-to-people experience - strange en count ers, even - which occurred nat­urally during my several years of hoodoo fieldwork. What were my informants like? That is what were - and are - my perceptions of them as people and as amateur or profess ional \"workers?\" How did they react to me? How did I select what to ask them and what to record? What kinds of problems did I encounter in the field, and how did I attempt to deal with them? These and similar questions are important. Before I began recordi ng hoodoo beliefs and practices , I did have several experiences which, I think, helped me to formulate an approach to hoodoo col­lecting . I began with family history and genealogy when I was quite young, tracking down family stories , etc. Later , as an ordained Episcopal clergyman, I did church work in the slums of several cities . And then I set out to record popular beliefs and supe rstitions in Adams County, Illinois. I believe that these three different experiences all helped me to understand how to deal with real people in actual face-to-face situations. This understanding was to prove invaluable in my hoodoo fieldwork. But I would like to make it very clear that I did not begin with preconceived theories. Rather, I let my informants tell what they knew, believed and practiced . I merely asked the questions. It prob­ably would be fair to say that I was a self-taught fieldworker, perhaps much as Vance Randolph and others of our generation were. In fieldwork, one must make his own way the best that he can - the proverbial phrase that \"experience is the best teacher\" is very apropos. In the beginning , I took down everything from my interviews , including sto­ries, popular beliefs and common superstitions. As I gained experience in the field, however, I began to be more selective. After all, my specific interest was in witchcraft and magic, and this is what I focused on in my selection of informants, in the questions I asked them, and in my decisions to stop or start"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"II -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -the recording machine. To have recorded evepything from over 1600 informants would have been a monumental -if not impossible -task. Also, as I gained experience, I was able to distinguish between the genuine, good informants and the fakes. I have concluded that the main diff erence between thes e two types is that the outstanding dbatoPs could make up a ritual to fit a novel situation - and the rite would be logical in relation to the system within which it was working. The improvised rites of the fake sounded just like lies, for they were out of harmony with the underlying theory of hoodoo. But the best dbatoPs were laws unto themselves; if it was expedient, they could defy magical tradition: they could generate the confidence that it was they who controlled the spirits, and not the other way around. If, for example, an excellent WOPkeP said that a spirit could cross over running water under certain circumstances, then one was compelled to believe him, even though the hoodoo system denies to spirits the ability to cross running water . The better dbatoPs also were able to incorporate new concep ts and technologi­cal innovations into their repertoires and still retain the aura of traditional hoodoo. The key not ions here are faith and confidence: I cannot overemphasize the importance of the ability of a dbatoP to gain the belief of his clients. Thus, a dbatoP was also an actor, a performer who dramatized his powers -quite often by the use of dramatic entrances, sleight-of-hand and other confidence­gaining tricks, such as flowers which wilt before one's eyes or snakes that seem to appear from nowhere. He -the good dbatoP -was a mysterious, elusive figure, and gave the impression that he had more clients than he was able to handle. He was a super salesman exuding a confidence which was contagious. Since each dbatoP was unique -and the better ones were quite creative and sensitive to the needs of their clientele -then hoodoo is understandably a very amorphous phenomenon. It is very difficult to pinpoint absolute beliefs and techniques; hoodoo was -and is -constantly changing. Many other pursuits are found in association with hoodoo work: magicians, patent medicine salesmen, for­tunetellers, healers, numerologists, and spiritualists in addition to rootworkers. This amorphous conglomeration that forms hoodoo work also has connections with other underwoPld activities, such as bootlegging, gambling and prostitution as connections to various relig ious sects, including Protes tantism and Catholicism . It is no wonder that we find such great variation in the hoodoo realm . In spite of the many variations in hoodoo practice, there are some general patterns that one can isolate and dis cuss. Perhaps the most obvious pattern is regional clust ering. The reader who cares to note rituals according to their place of collection, (a task which will be facilitated greatly by the forthcoming index), will see that in the New Orleans area (which includes Algiers and Mobile), the Catholic relig ion has had a considerable influence on hoodoo belief and prac­tice. For example, candles (or lights as they are generally call ed) are impor­tant, as are shrines and altars, and holy water. Likewise, there are specific hoodoo saints who, unlike their orthodox counterparts, are earthy and immediately relevant to their social and cultural context -true folk saints. St. Rita works only for women because her husband used to beat her up habitually, and her lover shot her son through the door because he interrupted their love-making (see Vol. I, pp. 880ff.). And certainly St. Black Hawk does not color the pages of official relig ious literature. One informant from New Orleans says, \"You don't fool with none of those good saints. But Black Hawk or some of those bad saints, you burn black candles. Black Hawk is supposed to be one of the old evil saints\" (Vol. I, p.863) . Other regional zones are identifiable, even in somewhat less apparent than the New Orleans-Mobile area . The East Coast from Maryland to Georgia seems to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -III form one such region, where the terms witahaPaft and rootwork predominate. In the Mississippi region from Memphis to Vicksburg (and including Little Rock), the term toby is used instead of hand. Florida seems to be a special case, not fitting into any other zone, probably because of a great amount of intermingling from other areas of the South and East and even showing some infl uence from West Indian tradition. I also have the distinct impression that the Mississippi River people are very different from the Coastal people who, in turn, are unlike the swamp people. Cer tainly thes e impressions are just that -impressionistici but these patterns seem fruitful for further inquiry. Again, however, I need to emphasize that each informant was a unique person capable of generat ing his or her own variants and versions of hoodoo rituals. The picture is not simplified by knowing that many, many informants periodically wor ked in Northern cities and returned home again after earning enough cash to last awhile. If the picture I am pres enting seems complex, then I probably am coming close to the way I see my hoodoo experiences. Folklore, history (includ ing oral and personal history), � psychology , and social-cultural studies must all be part of developing an under-1 standing of hoodoo. Whether known as highmen� �o-headers� root doators� aunj�es (a term which seemed to be pass ing out of vogue during the 1930' s), witahes (probably among the oldest terms) or fortuneteZZers, most practitioners were generalists rather than specialists: they would handle, or at least attempt to handle, whatever problems clients appeared to have. I found most of my informants to be funda­mentally decent, hard-working and able. Many were lonely and needed human con­tact -some interested person who could listen and understand. Most need ed mon­ey, and many came to me seeking employment. Unfortunately, I had no jobs for them, but I did pay them for their information, the amount dep ending upon the length of the interview and the value I perceived in their information. I made it a point not to interview those who obviously were intoxicated and those who obviously were not genuine workers. Even so, there were times (at New Orleans, for example) when informants actually lined up outside the rented room to wait for an interview. For a collector, lines of informants waiting to be interviewed might seem like an ideal situation, but it did have its drawbacks. Most importantly, lines of people outside a hotel attract attention. I did not want or need attention of that sort. The reader may recall that in Memphis (the first time) I was raided by the police and, for all pract ical purposes , run out of town. From that experience I learned to check in with the authorities of any city with written letters of reference and credentials. In New Orleans, a newspaper man came by asking quest ionsi he wanted to know if I was dealing in drugs. Fortu­nately, I convinced him I was not dealing in drugs and that there was no story to be had. In short, whenever and wherever people needed money , I found an abundance of good informants. Knowledge of my presence would spread by word-of-mouth. This, in turn, brought more good informants (as well as many not-so-good ones). In order to help myself evaluate the potential worth of informants, I devised a method of asking quest ions in a non-random fashion. That is, I had a long list of ques tions I wanted to ask, but I never asked the same ques tions in the same order . In this way I think I was able to detect those who had been prompted previously by their already-interviewed acquaintances. Bes ides , I wanted to structure my interview to suit each unique individual. Usually, this meant that I had to play it by ear. Another problem I had to deal with was the pres ence of the recording machine. The problem did not hinge on any reluctance or ret icence on the part of inform-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"IV -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -ants to talk into the microphone, although this was an occasional consideration. On the contrary, microphone in plain view seemed to bring out the actor in them; many began to perform as if on stage, thus des troying the more natural context I wished to pres erve. Therefore, I began to keep microphone in my old black hat at side of machine, a practice for which I have been justly critized . My later method is given on pages 4493-47 54. If only cassette had come 35 years sooner! And how did I answer when informants asked me what I was doing? I merely stated the truth -that I was writing a book about hoodoo, and I let their im­aginations fill in the rest. I am sure that most believed I was a hoodoo man who was writing another how-to-db-it book, such as one of the many variants of the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses. I did not wear my clericals, and it was fine with me if they saw me as the mystery man. Certainly, such an identity matched the situation well: I also found myself pitted against mystery men and mystery women who did their fair share of acting. I encountered many other difficulties in my work. To begin with, I was in­vestigating witchcraft -the black arts. People naturally tend to clam up when this subject is broached (as Vance Randolph and other experienced fieldworkers have attested). Often I was taken to be some sort of government man or under­cover agent, or, on the other side, an underworld spy from some crime organiza­tion. Actual government men and other authorities suspected that I might be dealing in some illicit affairs, such as drugs or gambling. Those who where overlords of crime seemed to believe that I was attempting to get in on their territory (something very real, I dis covered, while in Algiers where my contact men were actually threatened and where a detective agency had to check every night to make sure we returned safely). Also, I occasionally had to deal with apparent stooZ pigeons or undercover agents for the police who posed as inform­ants in order to monitor my activit ies. The fact that I lost perhaps one com­plete volume of material due to faulty recording seems minor in comparison to the constant suspicion from all sides . In retrospect, I was in much more danger that I ever realized at the time. Perhaps God does, indeed protect the ignorant and the innocent. I found that I could decrease some of the hazards by employing a contact man, an intermediary who knew the area wherein I was working and also knew the local people -if not personally, then at least in terms of the general character and composition of the local populace. It was the job of the contact man (who often was a taxi driver) to locate and informally interview those whom he felt might make good informants; simultaneously, he acted to screen out those whom he be­lieved to be rough characters -remember that I was working (the first time around) during the Great Depression in the inner cities (though they were no t called that then) . Many unfortunate people, especially blacks, were in dire need of money in order to survive. A white man who appeared to have a great deal of money and who was alone in a rented downtown black hotel or home would be an easy target for those who needed quick money and cared little about how it was obtained. So the role of the contact man was twofold: He could determine who might be of value to my work on hoodoo, and he also could size up potential informants in terms of their character and the possibility of any threa t to my safety . During my most recent fieldwork in Florida, Mr. Clarence Cubby filled the role of contact man. I should like to include a brief interview I had with Mr. Cubby, for it contains h!! perceptions of the people with whom we dealt as in­formants and some of the problems we encountered. I hope that this view from a perspective other than mine will help present a more balanced picture of my hoo­doo fieldwork."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Wit chcraft -Rootwork -v HYATT Tuesday, isn't it? I'm sorry , it's the 7th [of July] Monday 1970. St. Petersburg, Florida. I'm at the home of Mr. Clarence Cubby and we are just sit­ting here talking over the situat ion. There's been quite a rain this morning and the sewers are so bad that the streets have become clogged up with water. Wha t do you think of the situation Mr. Cubby, as we look at it at the moment? What do you think of the work? Is it discouraging? Is it easy? Wha t is your idea? Is there any way we can improve it? CUBBY I think it is pretty difficult because of the people themselves.

[Years before during the Great Depression people had come to me.] An' then again when we do catch them they are pretty well intoxicated or somethin '. That 's what the majority seems to have been. HYATT This intoxication, do you think it's because of the men who are help­ing us or have helped us, that they are inclined to be a little bit on the liquor side? Most of the people they round up are that way. [See what Prophet Warkiee Sarheed says about my two assistants Herman and Charles, p.4639, lines 17-27.] CUBBY This has been my opinion and this has been my thought for awhile that this was the type of people they seem to contact. I guess they were more their frien's or somethin '. They turn out to be alcoholics or somethin'. HYATT I see. CUBBY I felt some of them was usin' alcohol, you know, as a stimulant to in­duce them to really talk about the things they had to talk about. HYATT I see. That last fellow we talked to, he was so full of alcohol he couldn't get his story pieced together at all. He may have known something but he couldn't put it together.

I think what we'll have to do is no more assist­ants at all. And we'll have to go from house to house and in a territory where we're not known, because in a territory where we are known we have spent a con­siderable amount of money for material that was no t -outside of 1 or 2 people -was not very good. I think what we'll have to do is begin the other way.

And be­l would hear of like coming When I returned to hoodoo fieldwork after a hiatus of over thirty years, I found that not only had hoodoo itself changed, but that I also had changed. In many ways, my more recent fieldwork was more difficult: The Great Depression was over, so the grinding need for money did no t send a host of informants to my door. My search had to be more intense. Even when I found good prospects, they were not always eager to be interv iewed. Why should they be? Most were suc­cessful in their businesses; they did no t need me. Also, for many of those I encountered, hoodoo was only a sideline to some other, more legally acceptable, profess ion, such as fortunetelling, palm reading or healing . Again, such per­sons were less than eager to dis cuss their work with witchcraft. And, of course, as you have seen from the interv iew above, some informants were involved in ac­tivities which were not legal -another reason to avoid bein interv iewed. Fortunately, I found that preparing the manuscripts for the publication of HOODOO helped me with my fieldwork in 1970. The second time around, I was much more interested in the ind ividual as a total personality; I was less interested in collecting a mass of separate rites. Thus, the changing conditions and my own personal changes formed a happy coincidence: There were fewer workers to be interviewed, but I could interv iew the few in much more depth and detail than I had previously. I am sure the reader will note the difference between material in the second part of Volume five and the material in previous volumes. Of course, the cassette recorder is superior to -being more reliable and portable, especially -the old devices I had to use the first time in the field. This time I have made a point of retaining all of the orig inal recorded material. (Sometimes, experience is the only teacher.) Discuss ion of record ing devices leads to the problem of transcrib ing the interv iews found in these volumes. First, the quality of record ing has varied g reatly . For the first record ings, many variables interacted to create some rather poor sound reproductions. Fluctuating temperatures, for example, often caused the Edison machine alternately to speed up and slow down. Add to this the differences in voice quality and outside noise of all kinds (note in the interview above), and you beg in to understand that, even if the machine were working perfectly, many passages were most difficult to understand, much less transcribe accurately. Also, one must have experience in transcrib ing in order to do the best job. Thus, the later transcriptions are more accurate than the earlier ones. At all times, we attempted to render the speech just as we heard it, without idealizing what was being spoken and how it was being spoken. That is why the reader will find de in place of the or do' instead of door and so on. But neither I no r my transcriber were tra ined descriptive linguists or dialec­ticians, and therefore I have doubts as to the potential value of the transcrip­tions to scholars interested in speech variation -though, certainly, studies of lexicon seem feasible. One question has been asked of me several times: Do I believe in hoodoo? My answer is a qualified no. I do not subscribe to the theory that underlies and explains how hoodoo works (see below), but I do recognize that hoodoo can be efficacious for some problems. These, I believe, are without exception problems of a psycholog ical or psychosomatic nature: The ailments that faith, belief, and confidence can help to overcome. In many ways, the hoodoo man was a prescursor"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo - Conj uration - W itchcraft - Rootwork -IX to the modern psychologist or psychiatrist. People purged themselves merely by telling someone else about their problems, and then having the faith that that person would be able to help them solve their problems. Quarrels in the family, uot being able to hold a lover or a job , and sexual impotence are a few of the .any examples of common complaints for which one mi ght seek the help of a two­headeP. My caveat is that seeking help from healers can be as dangerous as self-treatment. In my opinion, not consulting a medical doctor about cancer is sure suicide. As for fortunetellers and palm readers - I have no belief whatso­ever in their powers. The major underlying concept which runs throughout hoodoo is the dual division of the world of causes : There is a physical cause and existence for every object and action, but there also is a spiPitual counterpart. To deal only with the physical reality is to miss half of the treatment. For example, a man working on a grinding machine receives a steel splinter in his eye and goes to a medical doctor for treatment; the splinter itself is remov ed but the eye still seems ir­ritated . The reason for the continued malady is that a medical doctor deals only with the physical cause (in this case the splinter) without attending to the spirit still residing in the eye. A root doctor or cunjure or two-headeP must deal with the spiritual reality . Only when the lingering spirits are exor­cised can a person be healed completely. Of course, the shadowy world of spirits is used extensiv ely to cause as well as cure numerous conditions , such as attrac­tion, banishment good luck and success, or any of many physical harms . A relat­ed idea is that thoughts and words have power to influence the spirits of things, hence one must talk to the spirits. On the surface, it may appear that one is speaking to a dumb creature, such as an ant, or to an inanimate object, such as a piece of lodestone, but such a conclusion ignores the spiritual dimension in­herent in all things. The theories and techniques of root work and conjuration are quite often pas­sed from one generation to the next within certain families. DoatoP Lindsay (Vol. II, pp. 933A) , for example, learned from his mother who, he asserted , \"could tell you more than you want to know.\" DoatoP Walker (Vol. V , pp. 4688ff.) learned root work from his grandmother, who was regarded by neighbors as a witah. It is apparent that there is no sexual preference for would-be doatoPs - both men and women teach and learn from one another. Frequently, certain signs are said to accompany the gift or poweP: A doatoP is supposed to exhibit Ped eyes or some special mark on the forehead which, conveniently, only another gifted indiv idual can see. As for academic theories concerning hoodoo and related practices: I leave that for the scholars who use these v olumes . I do, however , have some opinions about the relationship between theory and fieldwork. Most strongly, I believe that theories without a solid foundation of fieldwork are not of lasting value. For this reason (among other good ones), I feel that folklorists need to get out in the field among people, at least periodically. Truth (however you define it) is not the private preserve of libraries and academic institutions. To those names of persons previously mentioned in these v olumes for active interest in or contributions of good will towards the publication of HOODOO, I must add a few more. Any serious omission or later assistance can be corrected in volume 6. Michael Edward Bell has visited me several times and tape recorded our conversations. H is good penetrating questions forced me to think about -then to speak about - most of what is included in the present introduction. Recently I have not been well and without Mr .

Similiarly include thanks for L. F. Snow, Ph.D., she of Michigan State University, and Henry Louis Gates of Afro-American Studies, Yale University, who came to Quincy, Illinois to interview me. This was quite an event for HOODOO and me, the visit of an interes ting young black intellectual from Yale and the Univ ersity of Cambridge! Ann (Mrs. Alfred F.) Pogge has typed the final manuscript of all five volumes, a diff icult work for which I am grateful to her . Also add my gratitude to Mrs . Harry Dye! for typing double spac ed much of the preliminary hoodoo material. With them must be named Mrs . Pogge's daughter Mariann, who did some special in­dexing for me. Outside the hoodoo field, yet within Afro-American studies, I must mention my niece Mrs . Frances F. Leventis and her sons John F. Leventis and the Rev. Harry Hyatt Leventis, the latter an Episcopalian clergyman like myself; these for work on family history through the years which included documents conc erning slaves formerly owned by our families in Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri. Similar thanks must also be extended to my second cousins Mrs . Wana (Schrader) Clay Olson and Mrs . (Nelle Miller) Glen Gundy, who recently sent in their reminiscences of Frank Henderson, one of our family slaves I first met in 1915 across the river from Adams County, Illinois in Lewis County, Missouri. It was from Frank that I learned, in Northeast Missouri at least, slaves were buried in a section of the family graveyard. Having underestimated the size of volume five all this latter material will be published later . Please remember, my interest in Afro-American studies did no t begin with HOODOO, but in childhood with slave stories told by my mother, born 1855 in prec eding Lewis County, and her father James Martin Miller born 1828 in Millersburg, Bourbon County, Kentucky . Three of thes e stor­ies have already been published: \"The Strange Cock\" in The.MiUeros of Milleros­b'Ul'g, Kentucky, Vienna 1929, 200 pp., p.l7, and \"Old White Goat\" and \"Bear Tracks,\" in Descendants of John Walton of Baltimoroe County Mapyland and HaPPison County Kentucky, New York, 1950, pp. 76, pp. l4-15 . The arduous task of completing the index for HOODOO now is being funded by a grant from the Nat ional Endowment for the Humanities. Professor Wayland D. Hand of UCLA has guided the indexing project since the very beg inning, donating time, effort, and even personal funds to see that a full and complete index of HOODOO would become a reality. Without his continuous interest and support, the NEH grant -and thus the index -would no t have been possible. Frances Talley of UCLA has completed the work on the first volume, and Michael Edward Bell, for­merly of UCLA and now at Ind iana University, has completed extract ing for the second and third volumes and is just beg inning the fourth volume. The index will be published in late 1979 by G.K. Hall of Boston as part of Yale Univer­sity's Afro-Amer ican Reference Series, under the general editorship of Charles T. Davis. For their efforts in behalf of the index for HOODOO, all of these individuals and the Nat ional Endowment for the Humanities have my deepest grati­tude and appreciation.

Another use of 4 needles does not appear in our present section because it is more useful elsewhere bringing back a murderer (MURDER, No .7316, p.3251, v.4) .

A FIRST-CLASS EXAMPLE OF THERAPEUTIC LEGERDEMAIN PATIENT ON WHOM LIVE FROG TURNS GREEN IS POISONED [To understand this remark­able frog-turning-green rite, let us examine a similar rite previously given, the hoodoo woman from Bergen Junction (reference later). Here the victim, having exchanged shoes with another man , wore them to work next day : Dat night he wasn't able to walk home. He was hoppin '. His laig was hurtin' all up� olean up tuh 'is knee. An ' yo ' kin hear 'im hollerin'. Ah hear 'im my ownself ... two bloaks. De doator [M.D. ] he aome. De doator aouldn 't do no good. Dey had to go git •.. big [prob­ably both in siae and importanae] hoodoo woman stay out from Bergen Junation ..• she aome dere and she put her han ' on 'im jes ' lak dis heah [demonstrates] an ' drag it over 'is faae - we all standing dere lookin' at 'em - bring 'er han ' right down ovah 'is faae jes ' lak dat an ' aarried it straight on down� right ovah dat laig. An ' she done dat three times� an ' ... two toadyfrogs hopped outa dat man 's laig� an ' dat man got all right. Come out [the frogs aame out] baak dere where de two plaaes 'bout tuh aome to a haid - where it done� you know� formed a aorruption. Here we have one of those head-down-to-feet rites that drives di­sease or evil out of the body through the feet, often the big toe, into or on to the ground. How a sleight-of-hand artist would have performed this trick I do not know, but I can suggest a possible method. The hoodoo woman, probably saying she worked In the Name of the Lord, opened her right hand, turned it about to show it empty, and laid it on top of the man's head In the Name of the Father. Then slowly the open palm went down over the man's face, neck, shoulder, side of body to hip , thigh , knee, leg, foot and finally rested open palm on the ground . There may have been verbal mumbo jumbo along the descent . Next our hoodoo oper­ator saying she would now use more force, closed her hand loosely and began at the man's head again; this time In the Name of the Son. Her half-closed hand going down this time pressed heavier against the man's body . A third time and In the Name of the Holy Ghost, she laid her hand on the man's head, but now hand was a closed fist pressing heavily on its downward journey over the man's body . When she opened her fist on the ground it was empty but two frogs, young ones probably the size of hulled peanuts were jumping about . (Yes, I have seen many of these small frogs.) She then pointed out de two plaaes 'bout tuh aome to a haid� where it done� you know� formed a aorruption. Surely the aorruption on the man's leg was the misdirection permitting the release of the frogs . (For this hoodoo woman from Bergen Junction, see No .l263, p.441, v.l.) The reader will now understand how in our present rite the non-green frog suddenly could turn green. And finally the reader should notice how the present informant quickly changes from if ah be in de baid siak to if you be in de baid siak. This change occurs frequently in HOODOO. After all I was a total stranger to my in­formants , many of whom considered me a hoodoo doctor!

Feb . 15, 1940, informant No .l565, man 45 , GraakePjaak StoPe, paid, ng.\" (From note books E Series, 2nd New Orleans trip , numbers of informants 1558 to 1605). More about that ng in a moment. Informant was brought to me by the black man preceding him, a man who worked at the CPaakePjaak StoPe -sometimes called drug stoPe -a famous hoodoo empoPium of that date. During the following interview I was utterly unaware that this would be my last dat at Pat­terson Hotel, 7 59 S. Rampart St. , corner of Julia, New Orleans, La. Years later I would pay my respects to the old building by printing her picture at the end of HOODOO volume 2! The folding rite follows :] Say fo' instance yo' wanta git rid of a man.

She got down on her knees and crawled while barking. Old root doctor called in asks for a specimen of her urine . Naturally one glance at the urin e told her she was cunjured.

Ticks, yes, and she had slipped this in this woman's bed [by cutting the bed­tick cover and slipping bag into the cotton]. Well, this woman was sleeping in this bed and she - well, it gave her a backset [a relapse in whatever ailment she had] , you might say. And this woman stayed in the bed for about three months and no doctor [M.D.] or nothing could do her any good. That's - that was back trouble. And so, well this woman - well, her husband didn't know what was the matter with her, either.

And in a few moments, just a few moments after that, we had a letter from [about] her [their sister] from the doctors in Goldsboro [N. Car., from the state mental institution] . We wrote my mother a letter that she was getting better, but what did the lady [root doctor] do, I can't say . (She wouldn't tell you what she did.) No . [The arrival of a letter soon after a root doctor was employed may have been a coincidence, or a matter of routine, or perhaps root doctor knew a poli­tician who wrote to the state asylum for insane at Goldsboro (whatever its name) asking for a report.

She tell her, \"Well you keep atakin' dat medicine.\" She says, \"What 's in you goin' come out.\" She tell mamma, \"Don't you let [her] go to no lavatory. You let [her] use de pot.\" And she let her use de pot and she use de pot and she would vomit. She would vomit things jes' like maggots. De lady told her it was maggots. Dat's what she told her. She told her dere was nests of 'em an' she was goin' to get dat out of her, too. And after while one morning she got up to de pot, and she use, and she come to straining and straining, jes' astraining.

She couldn't even walk with it [before]. And she got well and now weighs about 200 pounds . (She actually got well.) Certainly she got well and she really was dat way .

Ah went back home and ah was taken sick an ' ah stayed sick about three months, wasn't able to do nothing. Doctor [M.D.] was 'tendin' me every day and everything. Seemed like everything he give me was against me . Ah'd get worse and worse. He tole me to go to de hospital and ah wouldn't decide to go to de hospital because ah didn't believe ah was naturally sick. And ah stayed roun' home and stayed, and everybody told me , said, \"Lady, you ought to go to de hos­pital and be operated on. Maybe you got 'pendicitis.\" Ah said, \"No , ah don't believe ah got no 'pendicitis.\" Well, ah worried and worried and worried and worried [these 4 worriedS are Shakespearian !]. And ah was stayi ng with a lady named - de same lady we was talking about - and she says, \"Mary, ah wish you'd go to de hospital.\" Ah said, \"No , Jiss Jenkins ah'm goin' try another doctor.\" And ah said, \"My sister was sick one time and we had a med icine doctor and he didn't do her no good.\" Ah said, \"Now it seems ah got somepin someone want me to have\" [someone had put a spell on her]. She said, \"Oh no, maybe not de same thing. Maybe you got 'pendicitis.\" Ah said, \"No I ain't.\" Well, ah got me some money, and wrote home to my people to send me some money, and ah took it to a ole lady named - ah forget her name, but she stayed dere - ah forget where she stayed [here in Newport News] but she is not here now. And she gave me - de woman got some [herb called] \"lone worker\" [my only example of this root!]. Well, it grows in de wood, a little low bush, and she dug it up and made me some medicine out of it. And I'd taken dat. I'd taken it for awhile and she [told] me to get me a silver dime and a file and grate dat dime, and take it [gratings ] in a pint of sweet milk. And after I'd taken it, to get me some Red Cloud peas [Red Cloud a brand name?] and get me some [kind of] poultice. It [poultice] come in a little flat can box about dat high [demonstrates]. You buy it in de drug store - 18¢ . And I'd got dat and taken dat and taken de other .edicine too. Well, when I'd taken de dime , I could feel, you know, somp in jes' going backwards and forwards, all jes' in me. And she told me , you jes' keep on takin' it and wait awhile and nature will take care of it. Ah think [to] myself, \"Dat old lady don't know what she doin' . She can't cure nobody. Ah'm jes' goin' to die anyhow.\" When she come back to see me , she told me what I sayed about her. She said, \"You don't think I'm going to cure you, do you?\" Ah said, \"Ah don't know, don't seem like to me dat it done me any good.\" (What did she say to you then, when you told her that you didn't believe in her?) She tell me , \"You don't believe me because de medicine is so slow; but what's in you, you have to go slow to get it out of you. I've had to go slow.\" Ah said, \"I want to get well right away.\" She say, \"Well it be sometime before you get well, 'cause you got some poison, in some whiskey or wine it was.\" Ah said, •Ah haven't got no wine.\" She said, \"Did you go to a party on Wash Avenue?\" Ah said, \"Yeah, ah certainly did.\" She said, \"Didn't somebody look in de wardrobe and get you some wine?\" Ah said, 11Yeah, dat1 s what dey did.\" �, I know she vasn't dere.

Ah thought ah could. Well, she told me to get up . Ah got up and went in de dining room and got me some water and come back in de bed . She said, \"Jes' like you got up, jis' like something goin' come out of you.\" Ah said, \"Dere ain't nothin' in me.\" She said, \"What's dat moving in yuh?\" Ah said, \"Ah don't know.\" She said , \"Thursday morning you get up and get de pot and use it, and don't you look in de pot. Get someone else to look because it may scare you.\" Well, you know, ah wanta see anything come out of me myself so ah knows. And ah looked in de pot and dere was a frog in dere. Looked like a frog. And she told me it was a frog, and a scorpion about dat long with a red head to it. She got dat out me. But ah know dat somepin can be done to people. Dat was about three years ago [1934]. [Newport News, Va. , (483), 510:2.] 11257. [The following document and the one preceding it, mentioned later, are of social significance, the effect of hoodoo on mornings and family relationships. This woman was merely one of many informants who could express herself fluently and idiomatically .] The next experience that I had, I had a visitor to come to see me; a daughter [husband's] from Detroit and a daughter [husband's] from New Orleans, and a new­phew [husband's] and a [his] girl friend. After they left, they made the remark, \"If it's the last thing we could do, we goin' to see her losing her home and not TWO HOODOO DOCTORS - ONE WHITE AND OTHER BLACK APPEAR HERE AND IN INFORMANT'S PRECEDING RITE SHOULD READ FIRST - RITE 975, PAGES 369-372 living with our father.\" Mah husband - ah am his fo'th wife - he has three sets of children. They gets their youngest sis­ter - they would get the ingredients of what dey call go powder or get away powder. This go powder would be placed on mah front porch and burned. It would leave a white acid spot on de floor. Dat didn't seem to make me go. They went an' got a oil an' po'd it at mah front gate - ah kept in touch with all of this work as they were going along. (What did they call this oil, did they have a name for that?) Well, the oil, as the get away powder didn't work, they got what they call de get away oil -a liquid oil so that they could pour it and it would git on de ground so I w ould walk on it. Don't chew see, that carried it in de house, and to be confused with it in there to git it on mah feet when ah'd pull mah shoes off. Well, that didn't seem to work very much. They got a ole white woman [hoodoo doctor] to come to mah house at the absence of me in the presence of mah husband. She poured a liquid -something looks like lead melted - ah don't know the name of it [quicksilver?], but she poured that on de floor. And that was poured on de floor that I would have five years of hard luck there - that I would be defeated finishing paying for that home - that everything, every effort I made I would be defeated in it, because I was determined to pay for it. Well, after doing that they found I had begin to drift, begin to lose interest in the home - begin to lose interest in everything. Then the person of itself and the daughter had got in a conversation together, from whom I had bought -bargained to buy de place. She gave me a warranted deed , and this warranted deed stated that there was no lien, no incumberance on the said property that 's locat­ed at the corner of St. Peter Street and Plum Street. I paid on that warranted deed , believed the statement after having two lawyers to examine the papers."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -4163 They stated that it was all right. Going on through this daughter and the individual that I bought from, they did something, ah don't know what it was, but ah became confused and left home and went to New York. Jest picked right up and taken mah jewelry and went on up to New York. Ah stayed up there three months and three days. On the 27th day of June ah had a job working fo' Dr. Friedman on 90th and Broadway. Ah was lying on de bed an' - it was a Friday . (What year was this?) That was last year. (1937.) 1937. Ah got up and ah said to the madam of the house, ah said, \"Ah'm going home, mah mind leads me tuh go home.\" I had got a letter that day and that letter, it jes' looked like to me - it worked me up jes' in de mood to leave. I couldn't understand why it was . It was nuthin wrote on the letter that was confused but only the letter said like this: Dear Elsie: When I sit on the front porch each day ah think of you and the children - it makes me feel so blue, until I feel like screaming. Well dat letter jest worked me all up . (Who wrote this letter?) Mah husband wrote the letter but the daughter done de fixing to the letter. Whatever they done to that letter confused me so that I had to come home. My money that I made [author interrupts]. (That was your stepdaughter?) That was mah stepchild. The money that ah made - ah bought mahself $1.27 dress - ah made $347.80. Ah had that much besides paying mah bus fare and mah two other children's bus fare. I come back home and turned that money over to .ah husband. Instead of him paying the money on that place -yo' see that how ah was hardtimed all de way through. It was understooden between the daughter, the person that ah bought it from, and the husband - to overthrow me in mah way, to defeat me of the home. He didn't pay it, he jest done away with it. When ah ast him about it, he jest put me off and ah never could get any information. So ah became grevious . Ah goes back to this same person [black doctor] that ah carried these first things to [in rite 975, pp. 369-372]. Ah said to her, ah said, \"Please mam, tell me what is the trouble with me that I am defeated in everything that I put forth efforts to try to exist to make a living .\" She says, \"You have fought a good fight.\" She says, \"Yo' goin ' tuh be defeat­ed, yo' goin' tuh be put out of doors. That 's the very best you can do because the things that they have done is to turn everybody against chew, not to believe your statements of whut chew say; whut yo' would tell 'em when you would go to ·�, that chew can't keep a job an' yo' can't keep any money.\" Ah could have. Ah have had as much as $25. It would go away from me, and in three days. Ah couldn't tell whut that money was spent for. She said, \"Yo' are fixed so that everything, -=a:.::l:.::l;.....;:;d:.::e�m;.;;o..=n;.;;e�y__;;;;a;.::n;.,.'--::e;.;.v-=e:.::r._y..;;t;.::h;.::i;.::ng-...._y-=o-' lit will go away from yo' an' yo' can't tell what it 's goin' fo'.\" Part of it ah'd give it to him -give it to mah sisters. Ah would buy things �th it. Ah jest destroy it. Through the year until November, that same trouble of last year that I was l!aving -I go to the party that I had bought from and ah said to her, I says, \"I can't continue - couldn't no longer continue to pay yo' on this property until yo' so an' straighten yore taxes up. Ah have been smart enough to find by the Home"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"4164 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -Owners Loan that chew had a mortgage on it.\" And ah said, \"You have got the biggest po' tion of the money, which leaves me a small sum.\" Ah say, \"You owes $276.67.\" Ah says, \"Ah owes yo ' $325.\" Ah said, \"When ah'd gone today to the tax office, de man down there refuses to take mah money.\" Ah said, \"Now, let us get together as friends, go down and pay those taxes off,\" and ah says, \"an' yo ' turn the Home Owners Loan over to me that ah kin continue mah payments, that I would have a clear title according to yore warranty deed dat yo ' gave me.\" Ah said, \"Then ah kin proceed to pay yo '.\" She says, \"Well, all right ah'll go.\" She went off and she brought me back a verbally statement. You see, mah hus­band, the stepdaughter and de woman all understood each other. So she came back and brought me a verbally statement. The statement was this: \"Mr . Tooart said that the County and State taxes was mo ' important to pay then the city tax.\" Ah said, \"Well, ah don't keer whut Mr. Tuart says.\" (Truehart?) Tooart - ah don't know how to spell it. He's a tax man. So she said to me - ah said, \"Ah don't care what Mr. Tooart says to you,\" ah says, \"it is necessary for all taxes to be paid to be a loyal citizen.\" Ah says , \"And that's why we pay our taxes - that our city kin be properly cared fo' and our school funds can be raised for our children to go to school,\" and ah says, \"ah believe in doing the things that's right.\" 'Now,\" I say, \"if he tells you that it's more - one tax is more valuable to pay than the other - they all are valuable the same way.\" Ah said, \"Now, ah can't pay you any money until you do this - until you turn this Home Owners Loan over to me and let us go and pay the taxes . I have the money to pay you.\" So she shut her mouth and talked with mah husband and this [step]daughter. They let it Pot on from November up until the 5th of February. She never said anything at all to me whut was her intention. She then, when ah came in on Sat' day afternoon which was the 5th day of February - a neighbor called me as I was pass 'n by, she called me by name, she said, \"Do you know you are write up in de papers in Mobile [newspaper]?\" [I] tole her, \"No,\" I says, \"it's good thing,\" I says, \"that ah am.\" She says, \"Yore place is to be sold on the 28th day of this month for cash to the highest bidder.\" Ah said, \"Where is it?\" She said, \"Do you take The FPess?\" Ah say, \"Ah do.\" Ah goes on home and I look in it and ah found it and ah read it. Ah goes to h er and ah says, \"Belle,\" I says , \"ah don' t feel that you have treated me right.\" Ah said, \"Ah give you mah money three months in advance,\" said, \"me and mah chillun didn't even have their gruel cooked on Friday - didn't even have wood [to cook it] - to pay yo ', an' ah advanced yo ' three months at de time.\" And ah says, \"However, if you feel that chew dealt square with me by treating me that way, it's all right.\" I then leaves her and ah goes downtown. To show you how ah have been actually defeated every way. Ah come back home. When ah come back home, it was something spreaded - ah didn't git back home till late. When ah got back there ah felt dubious about something, and it looked like to me it was a latta white beach sand - sand that come off near a creek where it was real clean -spreaded all over de gallery [porch]. And as I walked up on the gallery ah begin to do mah feet that way [scrapes her feet] - it was so thick on mah feet - scrape mah feet"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -4165 and ah went on in de house.

So this morning - after they had treated me like they did, and ah was defeated and all of mah lawyers and everything with the disadvantages that they had on me , that they had turned their backs against me - this morning, ah had a barn in de back yard was 10xl5 feet. Ah sent mah brother word, tole him to come an' tear the barn down, take it off. So he came to tear the barn down to take it off. To prove all the statements of the advantages she had been taking, she came out this morning and emptied it all open to me - tole me right to mah face. She walked out to him and she said, \"Have the law give yo' permission to tear dat barn down?\" He say , \"What chew talking about?\" An' ah was looking out of the window, the kitchen window and ah could see her out there. So ah walked out and ah said, \"Good morning,\" ah said, \"what is it all about?\" She 'lowed [allowed = declared her opinion or intention], \"Heah yo' come to interfere. You cannot take anything out of that house. You cannot take anything offa this property. It's orders by the law . And if you do, you'll be dead,\" she says, \"damned and will live less than 24 hours, because whom ah got working fo' ae determined to kill yo', if ah can't git chew outa dis house by law.\" Ah looked at her and ah says to her, I says, \"Now, ah'll tell you one thing,\" ah said, \"for the respect that ah have for mah brother and mah children,\" ah said, \"ah'll see you an' all yo' cohorts in hell an' me pissin' on top of yo' ,\" ah says, �efo' ah'm goin' be actually defeated in everythin' ah do.\" Ah says, \"Ah still have a chance.\" I says, \"Ah'ms not a tramp , ah'ms a citizen.\" An' ah says, \"Now yo' have come out verbally an' told me whut yo' intends to do and whut yo' has tole me an' all of yore advantages.\" Ah says, \"Tear de barn down,\" ah says, \"ah'll stand de consequences.\" So he toe [tore] de barn down and when he left, she commence takin' somethin' in her hand [demonstrates] that way throwing at him. She says , \"Well, if yo' don't die, he will.\" Ah says, \"By God, ah come from a family of folks that lives from 75 to 115 an' ,\" ah said, \"ah'll live that long too.\" So ah've been defeated in everything through the advantages that they have �en of me . Ah can't git nuthin. Today I hasn't got one penny in de world. (What is the outcome of that story - what happened to the property, then?) The property - they supposed to put me out doors Monday morning. (This happened recently?) This jes' happened today - happening today - working up to Monday ab 'm sup­posed to put out Monday.

He, informant 464, also makes one of those great entrances mentioned in the INTRODUCTION - enters, says nothing, walks up to his side of the interviewing table, and then blows flames of fire out of his mouth at me .

(Well, when these people come in - go to you - do they tell you their diffi-culties and you help them?) No , I tell them. (Oh, you tell them. I see, they just come in and they don't say anything .) Don't say anything. I just tell them what they want when they come in . (And then you know just how to take care of each case, what to give in each particular case.) Ab solutely . (Do you have special office hours or?) Nine to eleven - two to five. But today, on account of it being Thursday, the [Something] Street offices are closed after twelve o ' clock, so I got to get there and tell the people 'fore twelve o ' clock. (Do you make any medicines?) I do. I make a tonic for the body functions - digestion, digest all into the body . Goes to the liver, the kidneys, the bladder, you stomach, your blood and your bowels - to eradicate constipation. And also make a wine tonic medicine -a very good medicine to bring you vitality .

Is there anything he can do"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -416 7 especially to get a job?) Lodestone is one of the best things - and Adam-and-Eve. He can carry it in his pocket. (When you make gambling hands?) [You take] lodestone, one silver dime , High John the Conquer, Adam-and-Eve, anvil dust and nine Victrola needles. Then keep it soaked in Hearts Co logne and don't let nobody touch it. Keep it in your own pocket where you have your money you gamble with. You don't ever use quicksilver [tin foil or scrapings from mirror back] in there. Carry the right hand little finger in their pocket. (Oh, the little finger of the right hand.) Little finger bone. (Well, what can you do with that particular bone?) That bone is a bone to keep evil spirits away - so they claim. Now get this, I'm making it plain now - so they claim. Now, I've had contact with different places and I -I'll make it, \"So the rest claim, not me.\" Because if I can't be right, understand, I don't want to talk with you at all. What they claim, not me. (Well, what do they claim? What about it?) Claim it will keep evil spirits away, remove your enemies and bring better conditions to you environment. When a baby is coming up in a lot of these countries, there's a snake will always come where that baby at. And as long as that baby plays with that snake that snake will not unharm [harm] the baby, you either. But if anything kill that snake, he's liable to call the undertaker for the baby. (The baby will die, too.) [This snake and baby superstition is usually connected with food, especially milk-see FACI, 2ed., pp.62-63, Nos. 1571-1572.] [How do you] (keep the law from the house?) That's easy - 35 cents, that what it cost. It's easy to collect $50 for that. Go to the drug store and get a bottle of rhubarb [liquid preparation]. Go to your kitchen and get bicarbonate of soda, which is nothing but plain baking soda. Take the bottle of rhubarb and plain baking soda and ten dimes and cuss God with them and read John 3:16 [\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son •••• \"]. And just take the [blessed ] water and sprinkle it in your front door and back door, and the law can't come in. (That actually will work.) Actually works. (That you'd get a small fine, or get off, anything of that sort?) Ain't no fines in anything what I use -walk in and walk out. I use Ad� and-Eve - Husom and Bousum. (What?) Husom and Bousum -hang 'em and strangle 'em and master 'em -put 'em in a R9UCh with nine needles and nine pins and Black Eagle - that's lodestone. Keep it in your pocket and no judge can sentence you. (Well, now, suppose you tell me some ways people say, or that they can harm you in some ways.

The mother 35 years old, the daughter 18, [the mother] married to a husband 21 years old. The daughter is puttin' the mother out of the way in order to get the stepfather, and she is using the hair from the mother's head. (What is she doing with it?) By using it in a sap tree - in other words, each and everybody knows what a sap tree is -placing it in there with a peg, nine mornings straight hitting it, the nint h morning she runs the mother crazy - not dead , crazy. (Well, now, how would you handle a case of that kind?) Take a case of that kind, it's only one thing you kin do, that's go into the woods and get: mandrakes, Indian turnip, olive leaf, Sampson root snakeroot [Sampson snakeroot?] and rattlesnake [root ]. Taking those roots and combining them together and taking what is called the magic crystal , locating the tree, removing the stop [plug] and replacing that in there. That eradicated the cause that has been placing it upon her. (You say, a magic crystal?) A magic crystal. I have one. (What do you do, look into it?) It is used with salt and water - not the crystal - it's the magic crystal and there's only 26 of 'em made. As I told you, we hold our Convention in June. (Where is that convention going to be?) Algiers, La. , right across from New Orleans . (I might go down to it. Figure I could talk to anybody down there?) Do you want to go? I'll give you a letter of recommendation. (All right.)

They'll certainly move. [Here I either stopped record­ing to ask questions or informant herself decided to add a few details.] You vrite these names down 9 times on a piece of paper [usually these are written in a column one under the other]. Then you write across these names move in 48 hours. [In similar rites a woman writes down a man's name 9 times in a column, then turns the paper upside down and writes her name 9 times across his. This is called a?iting backhlards, or upside down. Here I am assuming move in 48 hours is writ­ten 9 times .

If that candle is to be set in the ceater of the saucer, so that it rests on the two slips of paper, how can it"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"4178 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -stand up without falling over? Among possible methods: (1) a very small (birth­day cake) candle can be used: waxed to the upper paper and lowered into the small amount of water in the saucer; (2) a round-shape tin can, opened, can have a ho le punched in its bottom, inverted over the candles, and the can holds up the candle. Moreover, the candle can be placed in a holder and set near the saucer.] [(960), 1544:5.] 11267. Like if you running rooming house, anything like that. Well, you take, get you some brimstone, put sugar on it, and you burn that brimstone every Monday, Wednesday and Friday , and make a wish.

New cures and then they outline it and then they give you practice fer it. Each day so many come in and practice on that. [440:4.] 11276. Now, in some of them, they goes in the woods. I have an old friend of mine, it is most good for those people when they get ready to sell theirselves [to the devil] to go on by another person. He will make him lay down.

Someone is going out of the family soon.\" It proved to be true. So when they drove off, they had a hard time to get the horses to go. They kept tramping and backing to and fro, to and fro.

He probably was but the family said he wasn't there and might not get home until noon and probably wouldn 't be back until 4 o'clock so we will try to catch this man again .

One question we discussed on the way home, did the policeman just happen to be in the neighborhood or had some­one, perhaps the doctor 's house, called in to say a suspicious-looking white man with two black men were in the neighborhood? I am reasonably certain that no one had telephoned in a complaint about the noise.

Our present interesting and experienced man became one of my 3 assistants, despite his holding a full-time and respon­sible job. By being well-known and getting about he could keep his ears open and make enquiries. This interview itself was contribution enough. We will hear much concerning the man himself , as well as another Doctor Buzzard he ap­parently never saw. Place of interview is Mr . Herman's home, part of a black settlement of small houses closely packed. A few other things I add at the end of this recording after listening to it at home next morning - see final bracket at the end.] CUBBY Before you get started, Mr .

I can get the idea only - they are discussing possibility of speaking to Andy and also Bishop Womack. All this second side is very poorly recorded. THER8 IS ALSO CHILDREN HEARD CONSTANTLY IN BACKGROUND. ] (The bad recording on the second side of the cassette was due to the fact that the children were just outside of the house in which I was recording . They were making so much no ise that Cubby, who was controlling the cassette, turned the batteries up very high and that weakened them and that makes the voices sound tinny and very rapid on this side. I'll go through this again and I'll make comments on it to point out what happened there. I must make a comment about these houses where this was yesterday . Yesterday was Thursday and this is the second side of this Herman Henry cassette. These houses are only about 15 feet apart. I've never seen them so crowded. They are in little rows, short streets. I must give a complete description of them. I want to get a photograph of the four of us together and probably right there where these houses are, we 'll see. I was very much impressed with Herman Henry . He was fascinating . It was unfortunate that the recording of this second side is so bad. It isn't as good as the first side naturally but there are things on it. I think he is going to be quite a help to us. The reason we didn't ••• he had electricity , but the reason we didn't use it was because he had a short and I was afraid something might happen to the machine. We also made a mistake - Cubby started ••• took his cassette and started to record this. I gave him some new batteries and he missed this bad side. He should have been recording this side. We would have had it had he tended to that rather than bothering about recording my machine. Well, you live and learn. I am going to interview Henry again . I think he knows much more than he has told me . I am making these comments on Friday morning. I'm going over this film. I got up at 4:30 this morning and I'm waiting now for breakfast - to go out for breakfast. This morning I am supposed to interview Mrs. Davis at 9:30. She seems to be an interesting and intelligent woman. I haven't the slightest idea what I will get. Now, the first thing , on the way down there I must stop and get some batteries put in here.)

In addition, informant actually tells about a childhood ac­quaintance who frequently came to school crying -the reason being hoodoo. This interview was recorded in the director's or informant 's office, my assistant Mr . Clarence Cubby being with me and absent only several minutes while he went to our car for another cassette .] [You will notice Mr . Cubby does not ask a question during the interview. He will give his reason later when we alone discuss the mat ter. But we should also know he is the son of a clergyman, has himself preached and expressed the possi­bility of entering the ministry. He realized at once this was not our ordinary interview but a pastoral visitation - I am an Episcopalian clergyman, you know, and was wearing a clerical collar. And finally , I did not seek informant; she asked for an interview through Mr . Cubby's sister.] HYATT (This is July 2, 1970, St. Petersburg, Florida . Mr . Cubby and I are going to interview a teacher, a teacher about an experience she had. Now will you please tell just what happened?) TEACHER This took place at my mother's house. They leased this great, huge Southern Colonial home in the middle of an Orange Grove in Indian River country . I'm giving you the background because it is peculiar to this true story, the setting is important . It's a very large three-story home. And they were new to the locale, so they had heard nothing or no stories or anything about the home or the territory . This was a former home of a senator, Florida senator, who is deceased now -for the past couple of years, I guess about the time this happened. [He had died several years before this happened .] And we moved into the home. I was staying there with my mother at the time . In fact we were there a couple of weeks before we started observing very strange things that we couldn't explain. I'm going to tell them to you in the way that we , I can remember that we noticed them. And the first thing was that my daughter was visiting me and we were sitting in the front bedroom -the house is built in wings - and she came and sat by my bed. And she was from Orlando and she said, \"I'm going back later today.\" And I said, \"That 's just great.\" I said, \"Come on lie back down it's early . Let's just take a leisurely morning .\" So, about that time we heard brakes screaming and squealing and all kinds of terrible noise out in front. And this is right off a very busy highway, a main highway. So we jumped up and ran outside and there was nothing in sight, nothing at all -there was not hing, no commotion, no traffic or anything. So we went back in the bedroom and had been sitting there a few minutes and all of a sudden this terrible noise again. We thought that someone had thrown [something] through -we have about ten or twelve picture windows on two of the wings on each side of the house. And we thought someone had thrown something against the window and crashed it, because you could just hear glass tinkling for ages you know."},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -4589 So we ran out again , ran back over to the window, went outside, went all around the house . There was nothing. She said, \"Mother somebody here don't like me.\" She says, \"I'm gonna leave .\" And we left 'cause we were new at the house you know. And this was a big jolt. But it was just too real because we thought we even felt the vibrations. So she left. And about two , five minutes later the driveway that she had pulled [her car] out in and circled the house, there was a terrible collision there, just as she had cleared it and gotten away from there. And possibly, if she'd been leaving a little later, you know, she could have been involved. And [formerly] there were three people killed [there] and of course they wound up in our front yard because they hit a tree . Now, there's an old legend to this tree. This senator had a will drawn up that no one could ever cut these oaks down. They frame the house at both ends. And the highway came around there and he did not want them removed. But eventually there were so many people killed there and - within a two week span we saw sixteen people killed from those trees. And the strange thing is there was - this all took place months later that things be­gan to fall in place. [Months later \"things began to fall in place.\"] A man came out to fog the area [to do something with the vegetation spray? ] . And he told me a little tale about why he thought the senator wanted these trees there was a matter of spite. And there had been many people killed on them be­fore we even moved there and when the senator did live there. And they had tried to get him to have them taken out before and he wouldn't. And I couldn't tell you how many lives, but I can tell you ones that I know about. And I can only tell you what we were told, there were a great number of people killed on this tree. (Was it just one tree?) No there was a tree at each end of the house. Now when I say house I'm speaking of the grounds . This was an estate, mind you, and a beautiful orange grove. But bordering this were these two gigantic oaks at each end of the prop­erty . And after this, after the third accident, after we lived there, the high­way patrol got a petition and went to Tallahasse and it took an act of Congress or Legislature of some kind and they just set the will aside. And they did re­move the trees. And it did seem to break the accident problem. But the house itself had many weird things. And we had been there only a day or two until we kept finding, starting from the kitchen, thru the dining room and the butlers pantry, and on through to the staircase - and the house was all carpeted - little tiny spots of fresh blood. This would be in the morning when we would get up . And we remembered having seen it before but nobody ever got curious enough to investigate. We thought something was being tracked in you know. _So after the third or fourth morning my mother got down and she called me and she said, \"Ernestine , I want to show you something weird.\" Said , \"Look at this .\" And she had wiped some up on her fingers, then she had gotten a tis­sue and blotted it, and we discovered that it was really blood. So we had a dog, and this is another tale, but it is all intermingled. So we did not know that the dog had been in the house and my mother started investigating each member of the house, questioning, \"Have you had the dog in­side?\" It turned out the dog had not been inside . We thought possibly he had a bur in his foot or an injured foot [to cause the blood] . So we saw to it that the dog did not come into the hou se. And this continued for some time, for a matter of weeks every morning when we get up . And then that would go away. During the day these things, these spots would disappear. But the next morning they would be fresh. And fresh enough that you could actu­ally wipe this blood up ."},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"4590 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -(And you saw this?) Oh yes, I saw this. (Mm hm.) The entire family saw it. And my father refused to believe what he saw. And then there were numerous people who did see it. (Mm hm.) And we were all, we saw it but we didn't try to clarify it in our minds. It was something you couldn't explain. So we didn't try to. And my mother opened a business within several miles of the house. Eventually some things were told us that begin to tie in . But we knew nothing of this at the time. (Mm hm.) [These 3 Mm hms mean I do not believe in the supernatural, even God is natural. Informant had these preceding experiences and more to come, but how and why I must leave to the experts.] And lets see , the next strange thing was ••• (Now was there a story behind this blood?) Well I'm gonna tell you what we know of the background. (Good.) The next thing that we had any problem with or that startled us I was talking to - my mother was upstairs and I was sitting downstairs. And I thought for a minute that my mother was talking to me. And then I realized it was exactly the way my mother spoke but it wasn't her voice, it was a man's voice I could hear. And it seemed to come from the dining room but only above the dining room [and] upstairs. And it took a while for it to soak in that th is really wasn't my mother, because the information and everything was the same as she used . And even used my name, called me by name and said something to me . And finally when it dawned on me it couldn't be her, I went to the stairs and said, \"Mother were you talking to me?\" 11No,\" she said she wasn't. \"Why?\" Well I didn't explain to her then but later I did. And as it turned out th is had happened to other people in the family. None of us wanted to tell anybody else because we couldn't explain to anyone. A few days or evenings later about 11 o'clock one evening she was going to this place, her business was on the highway and it was opened all twenty-four hours a day. So she was going in one evening and she called me up here, she said, \"I don't know but I've got a strange feeling,\" she says, \"there's somebody around here.\" And she said, \"I've looked and looked and,\" and she said, \"I don't have an explanation. But I'd like for you to be here with me until I've finished dressing.\" So I sat down in a chair facing the hall. As I looked out into the hall it was a bedroom, another bedroom door in my view, that belonged to my sister and the door was open, but all of a sudden the door slammed until it split the frame around the door. And of course this startled us and we screamed. So I'm fairly scientific in mind. And I thought that there was a draft and someone had left a window [open], this was in the wintertime and the house was closed and heated. So we went in, we went through the entire bedroom. Under the beds and the bit through the closet, everything. No windows open, nothing, no draft. So we closed the door this time and came back and oh, within five minutes the door slammed open again and it had a good sturdy lock and [it was an] old fashion heavy door. And it opened again�nd slammed with a violence. And we didn't tarry long. We managed to get out and go to where my father was. And we told him of course he felt this was just something that couldn't be explained. This particular th ing didn't happen again but, enough, wait a minute. [She pauses thoughtfully.] The , this did happen again, too, beca use my mother found that if she burned a light in this room that this did not happen. This is how"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -4591 it was. And as long as there was a light on, everything was at peace . But if she ever closed that door and there was no light in that room, then there were very weird things. All right, so now let me tell you we began to find, the next thing my mother thought was she should have a good dog for protection. So she went out and bought the most vicious German shepherd. He was suppose to be trained . And the dog came to us in this manner. But within a couple of nights he was a com­plete coward. He would hide behind all the trees. Tuck his tail between his legs and let out a yelp and just holler. And just go and hide any place under the house, behind the tree. You should see the grounds because they were, there was an old swamp way back in back of the house. And you would hear some very eerie noises. But this dog, I remind you, had been trained as a watch dog and a killer. He was a vicious dog. Then he got so he wouldn 't eat, he refused to eat. And he acted like he was grieving or something, he really just acted scared to death, just to tell the truth about it. My mother had to lock him in the utility room because she was , she felt so sorry for him. And he withered away until we sent him back because we were afraid he was gonna die. He was dying really. And he became vicious again, healthy , and well, when he left the grounds. So this is where we began to get the first inkling as to anything about the house. And we were discussing it with this engineer from the NASA program. (Now, stop right there. How long ago did all this happen?) Well it was when this was very, after , this property [in which they lived] was across so you could see this big building [at NASA program] you know the world's largest building? (Oh yes. This happened only a few years ago then? ) Oh this has only been, lets see, three, three or four years ago . (Oh, this whole story happened only three or four years ago?) Oh yes. (Oh that's fine. All right go ahead now.) .. So, we knew that this, this engineer that came into this place, we knew that he had, he was a scientific engineer from the NASA program. We knew that he had resided in there [this very same house] for a short while. And we come to find out that was one of the reasons that they decided to leave was because of the things that I've been telling you about. But we didn't say anything . We didn't tell them any of our stories. We just mentioned that we had a dog that was sup­pose to have been trained and that he became ill, and a very frightened dog. And he started laughing. And then he proceeded to tell us that he had two dogs there for the same pur­pose, and that he almost lost both of his dogs. And he said, \"You've been by my house,\" and he said, \"you've seen those dogs that jump at the fence and that'll cut your throat if you get near 'em.\" And we said that we had passed and had noticed the dogs, because you couldn't ignore them. And they were in this huge fenced-in compound. And then he said, \"Those were the same dogs that I almost lost at the house.\" He said, \"My dogs wouldn 't eat.\" He said, \"They were frightened and hid all the time.\" So this is how we got to talking to him. Then we came to find out this much about the background of the house. The senator had had three wives there and two were deceased. One had been an Indian woman and she was an alcoholic and had died in the one bedroom upstairs. The way we understood it. And this is, the rest of this is why we had to be very negative about our parties involved. But there was a rumor that he was very ill-tempered to his wives, and the third wife is still living. And that she had a friend and eventually the senator was poisoned. Now this was told us a number of times by people in the town, a very,"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"4592 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -very small town, they are really stretching it to even call it a town. And people who were in a position locally , doctors and so forth , wanted to know if there was a possibility for the , you know, it wasn't on the record - I think it was heart failure or something. But he did die there. And she inherited a tremendous amount of money and property at this time. But he died right there at the house also. And from what we , the descriptions we heard of the type voice he had and all, it was pos­sible that he may have been the person we talked to. But my mother is a very determined, stronger woman. She said , \"Well they just don't want us here, so we 're gonna wait it out. We didn't come here to hurt anybody [she laughs] and we'd like the place, so we are going to stay. Maybe after awhile they'll decide they like us. They'll put up with us here.\" This is exactly what we did. We lived there and we let them know that whoever was around or whatever was around, that we didn't want to be in fear of them, and we didn't want them to fear us . That we hoped we could work it out to be congenial, because there was a large investment involved. So we did it. Things quieted down. Strange things still happened every now and then, voices, and knocking at the door. My father, my father finally, by the way, over a period of two years, my father finally heard enough to convince him that there was something he couldn't explain in the house. Because he got up out of bed too many times and went to the door to answer someone that he couldn't see. (I see. Now do your father and mother still live in the house?) No they have just recently moved. (I see . They didn't move because of the ••• ? ) No, because they finally became compatable with whatever was there. And there were times that people, visitors would comment and ••• (And is the house still there?) Yes. {And as far as you know, have people been living in the house1) I don't know this because they just recently within the last two months moved out. (Oh I see. Very recently .) Ver recently . So I did not know. (Before you moved there, where do you people come from?) We 're native to Orange County. (Oh, here?) We 're native Floridians . (Yes, you're right from here. I see. I see. Now, did you ever have, any of you or your parents ever have any experience similar to this before that?) Nothing that I would call similar. The only thing that we ever had, and the reason that we were aware, we believe that there are t hings that we don't under­stand too well in the spirit world. Now, now my father won' t tell you that. He will tell you that he doesn't understand. But he don't like the word spirit. He objects to it violently . But he did have to acknowledge the fact. I have a brother who is twenty-three years old, he was killed in an accident. And this was before they had moved to the property I was just telling you about. And for some time after he was killed, he had a habit of walking up to the door and ring it [bell] to the tune of \"Shave and a haircut two bits.\" [She actually sings this !] Ring the doorbell or he would pound with his two fists every time he come in and out of the door. It was just a little ritual with him. (I see. Well how'd he do that? Show me.) Well, if he was knocking on the door, he'd go [she pounds her fists rhythmi­cally -you can hear them! ] to make the pause there. It was easy to distinguish."},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -4593 It was his little code for letting us know that he was coming in and out and often he would do this on the doorbell. Sometime he would do both. Because he was very mischevious, a great huge boy. And for some time after he had been killed we would still get the signal thru the night or daytime . It didn't seem to have any, particular pattern that we could distinguish. My father, my mother told my father about it several times. And he didn't believe it but eventually he heard it. He answered the door, looked, and went around the grounds. So out­side of this [sighs] at the time they were living at another house, we don't know what the tie-up was . But, I really shouldn't tell this because it's too preposterous, but my mother had a beautiful red scarf that she was very fond of. She wore it with white. She and my dad were going some place in the car one Sunday afternoon. And she said all of a sudden she looked down in her lap and there were pieces of it [laughs, seems a little embarrassed to tell this] being snipped off and falling into her lap . And she was driving, my mother was driving, so she didn't pay too much attention to it. (And you mean these pieces were dropping into her lap?) Yeah, my mother and father both saw it. (And while she was driving?) While she was driving the car. (Couldn't she, could she hear scissors or anything?) No, no . (Just pieces falling off as if they'd been cut.) Falling off. I said, \"Well, mother, were they ragged or frayed?\" You know sometimes when we tear a piece of material you'll have frays . She said, \"No, just exactly as if a sharp knife or scissors had cut them off.\" [She laughs again! ] And she said, now father said, \"Oh, Myrt, why you're crazy!\" (Did he see this?) She told him and she said, \"Well look over here in my lap.\" And so my dad turned and looked and sure enough there were pieces of this scarf falling into her lap . And she said by the time, the trip took I think she said an hour or so, by the time they arrived she said [her lap evidently filled! ]. We laughed and teased her so until we all cried. But by the time they got there the scarf had been cut off almost to her chin . Said it looked like she almost had a bow tie. [Both laugh (teacher and Hyatt) .] This was so wild we couldn't believe it. She said, \"You come on upstairs and I'll show you what's left of it.\" And it had been a long full scarf [laughing]. (Of all things.) I laughed and said, \"Mother, y ou know my brother had certain things he liked and he didn't like .\" And I said, \"He was so mischevious that's just his way telling you he didn't like your tie.\" And my father 's so funny, you know. He saw what had happened. But it's just too much to comprehend. You can't explain it. So now outside of these incidents, though, nothing unusual. (Have you ever had any personal experience? I mean, by yourself?) Yes, but I don' t think, I almost classify myself as a medium. But not until I was in my twenty's. And this comes and goes with me. (Well now, when did you first sense this?) With myself? (Yes. How old would you say you were?) Oh, probably twenty-two. But I'm aware of it maybe for three or four years or a year and six months. Then nothing for maybe three or four years. It has been almost a year now. Well I can tell you some of the things that happened in my new home. I have divorced and remarried in the last two years. And the man"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"4594 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation • that I'm married to isn't too aware of things. But he knows that I do say strange things and tell strange things that he has seen happen, you know, after I had told it. (What do you mean he 's aware? Does he know that you're a medium? ) No he didn't at first, it's just that I would tell him the names of some of the people he knew, or the ages, something that w as going to happen. And at the time I would tell it, there was no way I could know. (I see. And what did he , what did he think about this?) Well he's a very broad-minded and intelligent person and to him he was inter­ested rather than frightened. Which most people are frightened when you tell them something they don't understand . Instead of being frightened I found that he was extremely interested. (I understand.) And this was new to him. Completely new. He had never been around anyone or discussed spiritualism or anything. I don't call myself a spiritualist and I really don't call myself a medium. (You're a spiritualist?) No, I say I don't call myself that. (Oh, you don't.) No , no , no , no . (Your father doesn't like that word?) No , no , no. And I'm, I have no objections to it. I just don't classify my-self that way . (But you, you do say that you have at times medium power?) I have psychic powers. (You have psychic powers at times. ) I don't know any other word to explain them. (Well now, does this power, is it like the battery here in this cassette that I'm not using? Does it get stronger sometimes?) Well yes. (Then it's weaker?) Oh yes. (And can you feel this • •• ) Sometimes I feel things, sometimes I see it, sometimes I hear it. It always comes to me this way, from this side [demonstrates] . (Well wait a minute. That's on your, that 's from uh ••• ) From the right side . (From the right side?

Sometimes I see things . (Never from the left, never from the left side?) No, never, never. (I see. Can you give me an example? Give me an illustration of something?)

Well, would the room be dark or just the light, the light would just outshine everything?) Possibly this is true. I'm not sure, I never even paid that much attention to it. But this is, you asked for an example, I will give you an example. (An example, yes, let me have an example.) I woke up one morning at about four o'clock in the morning. And I, first of all a glow. And then I saw my father-in-law become very, very desperately ill. I could see the pain in his face. And he was a man who didn't like to complain or talk. And he kind of got a grin to let me know that everything was all right, but that he was desperately ill. And he did die of a heart attack. I mean I saw it happen . So I was still sitting on the side of the bed and I, I shook my husband. And woke him up and I said , \"Now the phone is fixing to ring.\" I didn't see anybody about the phone. This was something that was im­printed or knowledgable to me. I have no explanation for the reason I did . And I said , \"Don't be alarmed,\" I said , \"It's your father,\" and I said , \"he just passed away.\" And I said , \"I would rather tell you than the phone ring. And, you know , hear it that way.\" So I hadn't even finished the conversation when the phone did ring. And I couldn 't move. I was too weak. And this is another thing. I do become real weak sometimes, when I see things. So anyway .•• (Sometimes you become very weak after or during?) No, I'm not aware of it until afterwards. (Aft erwards. Not aware of it until afterwards?) And he ran to the phone and I heard him scream, you know, \"My dad is dead.\" And two weeks later at the same almost identical time [a warning] presented itself to me in the same way. This was not even anyone that I was well acquain­ted with. It was an acquaintance, the father of a friend of the family. And I saw the same thing happened at the same t ime , the same way, and it was true in the same way. So then maybe a period of years will go by and I don't .•. (I see.

Because when I first met him I was oper ating under very , very strong E SP. I don't know what. (I see.) But I would be talking to people in groups and things would c ome to me . He's going to be so-and-so of age when he passes and he will be killed in a certain way or die in a certain way. Things just, just a constant roll like a movie screen .

For instance, I knew my bro ther was going to be killed before he was killed. And I grieved and grieved and carried it so long until I couldn't stand it anymore. And I think my mother had this too, but she's like I am, she doesn't talk about it too much. But I finally had to go to my mother and tell her that I couldn't stand it. I walked the floors at night.

But , uh, as far as myself is concerned uh, I became interested when I started dating this man who was a medium. (Oh he was a medium. ) Oh yes. And he had such fascinating powers you wouldn't believe. But I have seen them. I've watched him -for instance in my living room one night . We were watching T.V. and my whole family was there, and were all talking, and all of a sudden, he gets these very weak spells, and the sweat poured off of him and he asked for a pencil and paper. And he sits there and writes. This is why Duke University was so interested in him. (Now wait a minute. How much • • • ?) [Hyatt again asks Mr . Cubby about tape time.] CUBBY You've still, she's got about four minutes. (I wondered about Duke University. Did he go up to Duke University?) Many times . He went every, uh, let's see he usually went in summer . Evident­ly they have a summer session. I believe he went in the summer and then he did go several fall sessions . And would stay for a period of six months at a time. He has done this for years. (Where did he work -whom did he work with? You know?) Was it Rhine? (Rhine.) Rhine is the only name that comes to my mind . But he would write in foreign languages that he did not know. He had only had high school education. And he would take these, he would save these letters and take them to Duke with him. And they could interpret these letters. (Did he, did he at any time, of course I dont know, this is entirely out of my field. I don't know what they ask up at Duke, but did he at any time receive any letters? Did he know where they came from? ) No, he only received the vibration, the messages. He picked up the messages by vibration. He wrote down what he - oh, and this is another strange thing . He didn't wr ite them out, you know, in a long hand. But they were always coded, and sometimes three or four pages long, sometimes a page long. (Well, did he decode them? ) He didn't, he didn't even attempt to 'cause he didn't know what they were. He didn't know what they were saying or supposed to say . He had nothing , [no] interpretation of it. (Did they decode these up at Duke?) Yes, they were able to. Sometimes they were in Greek and Latin, very compli­cated[?]. Sometimes it was poetry, things of this nature, apparently from a pro­fessional type person . [Since my informant has mentioned the names Duke University and Rhine, both well known, let me say what is obvious, I have no way or reason to check the truth of the preceding information about them.

And she stood there and named off these things she could see in the dark and I think often small children do. I noticed they get along better in the dark than adults. But this s eemed to last with her until she was in school and then tapered off to nothing. (Yes, I see. ) I don't believe she's that way at all anymore. (Have you ever known anyone that has thought he had a spell put on him? Have you ever known of anyone?) No. Except in high school there was a girl that we were all very fond o f. She was the captain of the softball team and so forth . Happy-go-lucky type of girl. But every so often she would come into school still crying, with her eyes swollen and just be a complete total wreck and I would say , \"Kitty what in the world is wrong with you?\" \"My grandmother put a voodoo on me,\" she would say .

This was Atlanta, Georgia in high school. (Oh, Atlanta, Georgia in high school.) And this was from an educated family, they weren't illiterate people at all. And I said , \"Kitty there's no such thing. You know you don't believe it.\" And yet she would go on and tell me little bad things that happened to her. She would have displeased her grandmother. Her mother and father were dead, I think . And her grandmother was raising just she and her sister . (Tell me the whole story . This is very interest ing.) Well, I don't know too much about it except that I felt very sorry for her because she would be upset for 2 or 3 days and she would just really be almost hys terical. And she would say, \"Well, I know I'm going to get hUl't before the day is over .\" Of course, this is a psychological thing where she could have done it herself after so long a time. But she would tell me how her dolls caught fire and things like of th is nature. (Mm hm.) And I had no way of checking up and my family had always told us that things like that were something you read about . They didn't exis t, you know? (Her dolls caught fire?) Yes. (Did they burn?) Mm hm. That's what she told me. (How old was she at the time when the doll • • • ?) At this time she was about 13. (And she never said how her grandmother had put a spell on her?) Y es, she said she used dolls and stuffed pins in them and things like this. (And what ••• she took the dolls and stuck pins into the dolls?) They were voodoo dolls. (Voodoo?) That's the first, my first exper ience or introduction to anything concerning voodoo. (You mean the grandmother had dolls • • • ) Right. (And she stuck pins into the doll?) Mm hm. (Well, how did she know the grandmother wasn't doing it against somebody else?) Well, the grandmother was displeas ed with her and told her she would put a curse on her. (Oooooh!) [A long drawn out, ooooh.] The grandmother told her. She lived with her grandmother. (Oh , then she did have a curse put on her then, if her grandmother told her that !) As far as she was concerned she sure did. And her sister also. There were times when her older sis ter would be upset and, well, they told you, \"Well,\" she said, \" I can't tell you some of the things that happened.\" You know she was just concerned about it. They were very real to her whatever it was . (As a teacher what would you advise in a situation like that? Where would a child go like that to explain his home situation?) You mean regarding ••• ?

In my experiences as a teacher for years, these are things that people really rather not discuss and really rather say than it is something else. (B ut it does, but it does go on.) Oh, it does go on. (It's amazing how much of this does go on.) Yes, it does. (And these children they could have their lives ruined by this sort of thing.) Why she was an emotional wreck. (Yes, and whether the grandmother did this sort o f thing, of course I don't know. Sometimes the grandmother may be a little queer in the head .) It didn't matter whether she did them or not because she convinced these children that she was doing it. (The girls thought she did.) As I said even though the grandmother may not have been able physically or by power to put a curse on them , she had them in such a state of mind they could have hurt themselves. (That's right.) So I would never say it can ' t be done. (And those girls some day are going to bring up other girls and they're going to have the same problems. A vicious cycle.) They will either be more vicious with their children or they will maybe be over protective. They could go one way or the other. (That's right .) They're not going to be in between ••• (Yes.) ••• and they 're not going to be very open minded about it prob ably . (No, no.) I've heard many tales but this is [my] only per sonal experience.

Yes, but not personal enough to repeat it, just ••• (What was it about?) The only thing that I ever heard about and this was an acquaintance that I did not know the parties involved. And the sister was just withering and griev­ing away because she knew someone had put a, supposedly put a curse on her and there was property to be inherited by the person that put the grief on her. (I s ee.) She did grieve herself, in other words, she withered away. (I see.) And she did die and the other person did inherit the proper ty.

No, but I have dated, I've dated a psychiatrist and we talked many times."},{"pageNumber":847,"pageContent":"4606 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -(Was he the common psychiatris t who kidded that he needed a psychiatrist?) [Hyatt laughs.] Well I think most of them do after they practice a while anyway. I wouldn't put him in that category. I would say this about him, he was very open-minded and broad-minded. (I think he should be open-minded and should have a sense of humor .) Uh huh.) (Not that there's anything humorous about it.) He didn't try to put everything in a category as many of them did. To say that if you believed one thing that meant you were so-and-so. He was not the type of person. (Yes, yes. In other words, it wasn't a pigeon-hole psyahoZogy. Here you come to me, here's the problem and I pick out, well that 's number 8 or it's num­ber 35 . That is not the answer because each one has an individual problem.) That's how I felt. We used to sit and talk for hours about it and he seemed to be very interested in things that we have no scientific answer for. (Do you think a psychologist could help in this sort of thing?) You mean where somebody had put a spell or a curse on another person? (Yes .) It would depend too much on the individual, their background and so forth . (Well, I think in the first place you would have to know a whole lot about the atmosphere of the spell-putt ing. If you just get it out of a boo�a lot of these things ••• ) I started to say , what would a psychologis t know about it? (That's righ t.) He would have to know the child from, the person from infancy, the persons that were involved with him ••• (And all the social background around him.) And he would have to have experienced something in this line as far as the voodoo ritual and all himself ••• (Yes.) ••• to be an authority on it. So I would be reluctant to refer anybody to a psychologist. (I see. Have you ever known the name of any, what would you call them'l Witch doctors or that sort of thing'l) No, huh uh. (I' ve now I've talked to one or two [here in St. Petersburg]. Some of them are good. Some [in my complete experience] are rather clever.

Those that are fakes and those that believe in what they say.) Well, leaving the fakes aside, what do you think? They do use their power in a good way s ometimes or ••• ? (I think most of them do.

I never knew him . He was a very able man, but an old tyrant in a way. I mean this is it. He was an Irishman, he was born in Ireland. He worked his way up from the bottom. When y ou work your way up from the bottom you are inclined to be a little bit, you don't see any, you don't ex­cuse the other fellow' s weakness because you have fought you way up to the top.) Right, you've done all the taking you're going to. [Hyatt laughs .] (So this problem, for example , in connection with my wife, she was the oldest child and the daughter ••• ) [Someone knocks at the door.] (Yes, come in.) [Someone opens door and says something but is too far from microphone to be audible. (Mrs. Dyel.) Doubtlessly a member of the teacher's staff. (Hyatt .)]. (Thanks for checking in on her. You're quite wise, we might have run away with her. [Laughs.] I think it's a good idea always to check what's going on because I have had some tremendous experiences. I 've never been frightened at all. I would say once I was frightened [stunned would be better] when I had a run-in with the police over in Memphis. I was working in a colored hotel getting this material from the and the doctors and you don't tell these fel lows [policemen], \"Now listen, I'm not taking any [money] ••• ! have a legal right to be here if I want to, this is a free country.\" Because they would beat you up and say I was resisting arrest.) It's not really a very free country anymore. (No, it isn't and I was one of the first persons to do this type of work. I worked in negro homes and negro hotels. I felt that if I'm going to ••• well, I did with the white people also. I felt that if I want a favor from these people I'll go where they live, you see.) I suppose they think from a white person you are going to come nearer get­ting the truth. A white person may feel compelled to garnish things a little bit and make it more presentable, you know. (Even sometimes when they are going to [tell the truth] people garnish it with folklore, in terms of psychological actions which are true . Do you see what I mean?) Uh huh . (Although they're exact details. I've had many stories told to me that are folk stories, been in folk stories for a couple hundred years and yet the fellow told this about his old uncle, you see.) Uh huh. (It was in pioneer times and he came up and here was this empty log cabin so he stayed in it for the night and in the night a man came and said, \"Follow me and I'll show you where money is buried.\" Well that theme appears in many stories.) Uh huh. (Now , he isn't lying. He heard the story as a boy and he's confused it, he"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"4608 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -thinks it was about his unc le. See what I mean?) Uh huh, yes. (Now these stories, again this is a field for the expert. I simply record them, you see.) [For folktale personalized, see story of Willie Glenn, uncle o f preceding in­formant Mrs. Davis. This was told in connection with Doator Buzzard, Willies escape from the gallows, and a memorial pole in Quincy, Florida - see pp .4543, line 24 to 4546, line 30, volume 5.] Yes. (Of course, I have my own opinions about things and here and there I'll ex­press a personal opinion. Now is there anything further you want to contribute to this conversation?) No , I think that's about all I have to say about this but I'll tell you about something strange that 's happened in the last nine months where I live now. (Oh , I see.) We bought a beautiful new home on the south side of town and to my knowledge there's never been a death there or anything else, because in talking to the neighbors they've filled us in on people who had lived there previously. (I see. Did you ask to be filled in or did they just volunteer?) Just volunteered, neighborly chat. We had been there possibly two months and I was in bed one evening and in the middle of the night, I'm guessing , maybe 1:00 o'clock. I heard these children giggling and laughing and as I told you I have two daughters at home and they each had their own bedroom . (Oh yes.) And they continued and I thought what in the world are those girls doing up this late. So I looked at the clock and it was a late hour and I got up out of the bed and they were still chattering and laughing away . It sounded like girls voices or young boys . I would have supposed they were about the age of my chil­dren . I went into the hall, they were each in their own bed sound asleep . So I looked up and down the streets to see if there was a car parked or kids walking in the street or something . No . So I went back to bed and maybe a week or two later , the same thing occurred about the same time . I checked the girls again . Nothing. It happened the third time and it woke up my husband and he heard it and asked me to go see what in the world the girls were doing up that time of the evening. Same thing , nothing . And this was in the wintertime , the windows were closed, you know. (Uh hum.) So in the spring we were sitting in the living room facing , we have a screen­ed in porch with windows coming into the living room . We were sitting there and we heard these kids laughing and chattering . It sounded like outside, just out the door. So we waited and waited and they didn't come in. [Someone knocks again to tell her she is wanted on the telephone. She asks who it is and tells them she will call her back. ] And so they didn't come in and they didn't knock and in a few minutes my husband said , \"Don't worry they'll come on in in a min­ute.\" So we heard the door open and they stood on the porch . And I said , \"Oh, that must be Marcy[?] and some of her girlfriends·, they'll come in .\" They were still laughing and playing , y ou know, and we 're sitting there watching the door and waiting for them to come on in . And when they didn't come in I said , \"Oh for pity sakes, go to the door and tell them to come on in.\" And so he got up and went to the door and nobody there. Nobody there. He turned on all the flood lights and the car lights, went all the way around over the yard. Nothing .

And all the time that you [Prophet] are working, you are folding this over, in and out among your fingers of both hands. And occasionally you tie knots. You don't actually tie them, you more or less half-tie it and then you untie it. And do you manipulate this all the time you are reading vibrations?

HYATT [Interrupts for annotation.] Before I forget, notice again, Mr . Cubby, that this silk cloth he has, he weaves it in and out around his fingers. Look, it goes one finger, then it goes every other finger, then he goes back and weaves it the other way . CUBBY Um hum. HYATT In other words it's like weaving cloth, a loom. It's weaving isn't it? PROPHET Tha's true. HYATT Are you weaving, are you weaving a person's for­tune? PROPHET No, it's not exactly a fo'tune. It is a reco'din' of ouh convah­sation. [Prophet laughs. He had told me this before. I was no t trying to trap him into another answer, because he could probably be doing several things with the same obj ect or ceremony.] HYATT In your younger life, at the beginning of your work, did you have other methods of telling a fortune?

You're coming back to something I was going to ask you. Have you ever heard of a Jack? PROPHET Not exakly. Yo' explain tub me, please. HYATT A Jack is, they're various varieties , but it's usually something that swings back and forth . It tells you yes or no. It swing s away from you and back to you, or it swings across in front of you. When it swing s around in a circle it is called to channel or channelling the �Pld. PROPHET Now lemme explain how this works . [Demonstrates .] HYATT Let me get this. If it means yes, it will go out from you and back to you; if it means no, it will go back and forth across your front . Out and back to you is called \"north and south; back and forth across your body is called \"east and west.\" [As the reader can see, these two movements of the pendulum or Jack, make the sign of the cross. For the Jack, see THE ''JACK-BALL\" MAN, pp. l593-1599, and MOJOH EXPERT, pp. l247-1268, both in volume 2.] . [A final word about Jack, who happens to be your alter ego, a self that usually does what you want or command. When Jack swings in a circle, this is called \"Channel de World,\" it being of course the modern round world. But Jack, by whatever name or des ign, also channels the ancient world when he swings east and west or north and south, or away from and back to you, or across you parallel to your front. In this latter case, Jack is swinging t o the 4 sides of the an­cient world, usually in HOODOO called the 4 corners of the earth (Revelation of St. John the Divine 7:1). How old is this swing ing devise anyhow?] [Suddenly we are surprised by a strange sound!] CUBBY The man decided to cut the lawn. [Those pictures at end of volume 3 show you the \"lawn.\"] HYATT Hoodooed again ! How long is he going to be out ther e? CUBBY About five minutes. HYATT Let us just cut it [recorder] off for about 5 minutes ••• You became acquainted with some of these superstitions?) PROPHET Ah saw 'em in what they call, a li' le place they call Baton Rouge [capital of the State of Louisiana and seat of Louisiana State University , on the east side bluffs of the Mississippi River, 78 miles up-river from New Orleans. The place is scarcely little today , 1977). HYATT Tell me about the ceremony you saw there. PROPHET We saw the one of The Los ' [Lost] Angel. This was a cer 'mony by people who deal in witchcraft an' voodoo work. These thin's are always held in, neah a cem'tery. They do not hol' 'em in thuh home. They have one where ••. [Hoodooed again!

For a graveyard rite with a group of per sons in­volved, see ZateP interview by Miss Jones regarding Professor Pickens.] HYATT Have you ever ha d anyone come to you with a problem like someone was killed and want you to find the killer? PROPHET We say take a bundle of foddah. Yo' undahstan' whut foddah is, is thuh leaf from thuh corn [maize]. They put [it) in a li'le small packet [or bun­dle] an' throw it in thuh watah. An' they say thuh direction this go would indi­cate thuh direction tha ' this person has gone, that has committed this crime. Thuh direction thuh foddah floats is thuh direction thuh killah took.

But if thuh police [do n't] capture 'em, they li'ble tuh go out an' kill two or three othah peo ple, innocent people. HYATT Did you ever hear that somet imes they do something to the murdered body to bring back the killer? PROPHET Yes, mahn tole me 'bout they bur' thuh body face down wit thuh per­son [killer's] name on some silk hanky at his mouth. Ah nevah tried it. [The Prophet now describes the \"mad-dog spell,\" something I had never heard before.] PROPHET This boy's [man's] cousin ast me if ah could do somepin 'bout it. He [her cousin] was gonna kill his wife an' he was runnin ' lookin ' fo' Hattie [his wife's] sistah. Ah could please get him so thuh police could catch him . She'd [man's] cousin give anythin'. So ah didn't charge her much, Doctah , ah was too upset. Ah heard thuh [wife's] story . It was so sad. She said, \"All ah merely wanted tuh do was jis' go tub thuh church an' heah thuh preachah preach. She'd [she had] come back an' cook an' feed thuh two children an' her husban'. An' this mawnin' he get up an ' kill 'er becuz she say she wus gain ' tuh church bah (by] all means. Then he say he gonna kill huh sistah. Now ah said, \"This mahn is somepin wrong wit him.\" So shore 'nuff he did 'ave this spe ZZ. of thuh mad daJJg. PROPHET See, he had thuh speLL of a mad dawg on him, jis' becuz he had mis­used anothah man in thuh Logwood. Yo' know Logwood where they cut logs. They cut logs tuh haul 'em out an' make lumbah . He bad hahmed thuh othah mahn, tha' man' feelin ' in thuh woods. An' thuh mahn wus not brave enough o r didn't have thuh courage enough tuh kill 'im.

PHOTOGRAPH OF AND FAREWELL TO PROPHET OUR COMMENTS ABOUT HIM [I had always considered that colored photograph of the Prophet and me at the end of volume 3 to be a part of our great farewell after three interviews in three different houses, but I was surprised recently when I began final work on the transcriptions. There was a fourth interview, unless this latter is actually the missing fourth part of interview 3 despite its later date, July 17. The quest ion is unimportant and I do not have time to reexamine and restudy the cas­settes at the bank.] [After the preceding photograph had been taken by Mr. Cubby and the Prophet had snapped one of Mr. Cubby and me, we reentered Mr . Cubby's house where I thanked the Prophet and payed him with cash and an American Express check, not having enough cash with me. At our first meeting I ha d given the Prophet cash long after midnight, these being the reasons he asked to ride along with me on my way home and then to be let out at his home near 22nd Street.] [Here is what the Prophet had said about a portion of that well-known street: A friend of mine# Rev. Jaakson ask me tuh speak a word or two up heah on thuh street. Ah dOn ' like tuh dO this but it [Bible ] does tell us tuh go into the highways an' hedges. An' thuh worse plaae ••• we dO need a lottah prayah up heah on 22nd [Street] on aertain bloaks up theah, yah know? Sure 'nuff need some prayah up theah {Hyatt laughs]. See p.4639 , v.S, lines 4-9. Remember, I had worked on 22nd Street 31 years before in the Clark Hotel (see illustration a t end of vol .3) when there was open country about, but it was considered a little tough even then.] [After thanks and p ayment we drove the Prophet over to the black supermarket on 22nd Street -said to be owned and managed by a black man - to see that his check was cashed and he reached home safely. We waited outside. Within a few minutes we saw approaching our car a black man Mr. Cubby identified a s the owner and manager. As soon as he saw me in the car he waved both hands t owards me meaning \"Everything's all right, stay right there. \" I waved back, reversing my hands, \"Come on down and stay a minute.\" He stayed two. I told him why the Prophet was there and showed him the first two volumes of HOODOO that had just been published. As he was leaving my final words made him laugh, \"We were here two weeks ago during the shooting.\" A few more minutes and the P rophet came out with his money. Instead of our taking him home he had decided to shop around in the sup ermarket. We exchanged goodbyes and successful futures .] [No wonder the supermarket owner and manager had laughed. That shoot ing af­fair two weeks previously had been quite an experience and since it happened while we were interviewing a young man in the car, it became a legitimate part of field work. We were sitting there in a store parking lot, the back of my car to the tra ffic of 22nd Street, when I heard a motorcycle backfire. Mr. Cubby excla imed, \"That's a gunshot!\" Within a few seconds there was another shot and then a third. One minute later traffic had stopped, people from the stores had filled the street, a police siren could be heard. The nearby intersection soon"},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Roo twork -4681 showed even the cross streets crowded. We could not move away.] [Here could have been a crowd turned into a mob had a false rumor been circu­lated. Fortunately we heard the news almost at once. A former employee of the meat market having concealed a large piece of meat on his person had just left the market when he saw a spotter [inside guard] coming after him. He began to run but the 3 shots up into the air during the brief chase stopped him.] RETURNING TO CUBBY'S HOME COMMENT ON PROPHET HYATT • •• Interview with Sarheed. We went to his house. In the first place he seems to live in any number of places , doesn't he? CUBBY That 's true. (Now was this woman where we went today [third interview] was she supposed to be his secretary?) Yes, that 's his secretary, Miss Kedd. [Not sure of this name.] (I see, I see. It was a very main highway. The noise was terrific and on the front porch the flies almost ate you alive. It was a hot, steamy day -morning. And inside there were those three young fellows lounging around. What about these interferences we had while interviewing? What was your impression? Every place you go the place is jammed up. Did they come in because we arrived or what?) Well,.! don't believe in hoodoo but I'd say we were being hoodooed or some­thing because it seemed like no matter where we go or how quiet it is at first, before the interview has ended, somewhere along the line, someone is goin' to come aroun ' or we're gonna get quite an interference or noise of some sort. Now ••• (Take today we had to come back here [to Cubby's house] to interview the man [the Prophet Sarheed].) We had to come back to my house. (Now what happened? Tell what happened after we came back here.) After we got back here, a friend of mine I hadn't seen in months -we used to work together -he decided for some odd reason to stop by and see me this morning. An' then by the time we got rid of him an' got deep down into the interview, un­expectedly the lawn man came an' he wasn' due 'til Monday , but for some odd rea­son he came today, which is very unusual. I mean once he says he's comin ' one day that's the day he usually comes. Then I was also thinkin' too that I wonder if these people wanta know what 's goin ' on. They see a strange person, yo' know. A couple strange people come to a place an' ever'one wants to get nosy an' come an' see what's goin' on. (Would you say that my being a white man and having a clerical collar on has anything to do with that?) In a few cases I would say yes. An' then in some instances I would say no. Now I think possibly people are wonder in' because they see you and I together ever' day ••• (I see.) ••• an' they don' really know what's goin ' on. An' they see it's [your auto­moible has] an out-of-state tag, an' maybe this causes a coup le of people to come aroun ' • (I hope they don't think you are a criminal and I'm hunting for you or some­thing [laughs].) Well, they see that y ou are clergy, an' I don' know, people's min' plays tricks on them a lotta times. It's hard to say what they are probably thinkin'. (What did you think of the P rophet today compared with his other interview? Keep that very near you because you are talk ing very low [meaning microphone] and it's difficult to transcribe.)"},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"4682 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -Compared to the other interviews I would say today was not his bes ' day . But I mean we did get better details today. I don't think it was his best interview today. I still think he still has a li'le bit in reserve. It might have been the surroundin's, yo' know. It wasn' one of his locale, wasn' some place he was use to. But I still felt that he reserved himself, although he did let go in better details in some things than he done before an' I think it could have been a li'le bit better. But all in all I think it was a very good interview. (It gave us some new material. I got some more details in about that black piece of cloth. It's only a very nervous habit of his. It shows a very involved mind.) I noticed also ••• (I would say he's rather nervous.) He is ••• 'cause I know when we were comin' over he didn't have the black han '­kerchief but he was forever twiddlin' his finge rs. Yo' know how you'd grab one finger an' yo' might pull it. An' if yo' noticed he kep ' diggin' his fingernails into the palm of his han' , probably pickin' off skin, I don' know. It seemed like it was a nervous habit he had. An' poss'bly it could be nerves or it could be jus' one of his habits that he's picked up . (Yes, I don't know what that would indicate to a psychiatrist. Then of course remember we took the Prophet's picture. You took the Prophet and me together and then he took you and me together. And then what I did with his money. I gave him half in cash and half in travelers check. And then he [we] went over here to Gregory's to have it cashed and all of a sudden, oh, about 5 minutes , he [Gregory] came out and wanted to be certain that I had given him the check, you know. It was all very pleasant. Gregory - it was all satisfactory as soon as he saw me. And then I opened up the back of the car and told Gregory what I was doing. I said if you see me around ••• Oh, I told him I was there the day the man did the shooting.) Oh, yes. (Yes, I said this isn't my first time here. I've been by that place almost every day for a mon th. I thought I might as well tell him what I was doing so I showed him the books. You'd think I was going around advertising myself, but it seems to pay off better than trying to be private.) I think since you've been advertising yourself lately, things have begin to pick up just a little- not a great deal, but I mean it's not as rough as the first few weeks or so. An ' also I have a notation ••• (You keep that [microphone] you're talking.) I have a notation here where you wanted to make a comment on the three holes in the han'kerchief. (Oh, the 3 holes in the handkerchief. Well it's going to be difficult for me to describe. It isn't a handkerchief it's almost more like a ••• ) A scarf. ( ••• a scarf. I would say it' s about 2 feet wide and 3 feet long, or maybe about 2 1/2 feet long . It's a thin mesh an' it's supposed to be silk. He wraps it in various ways. You see he'll do this like warp? move? You see. [I am demonstrating .] Around this and then he'll come back and do it the other way. Then sometimes he'll go all the way around that like this [demonstrates ] and then he'll tie it. And then he ? and the knot would come untied. He'd [I would?] say well fellow, from looking at this, is ill, isn't too well. Then of course he said to us, he's recording things. Shows his mind is sometimes on this thing. Like people have a tic you know, they jump or the eye twitches. It's entirely a nervous thing . Now I don' t know, I think I have enou gh of it in to put it all together and get some kind of description in there.)"},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -4683 That turban that he wears - you know his seeing and hearing hat as he calls it.

It seems ••• (I'd think he could get a better looking turban than that. He could get a real turban. That looks more like a ••• I don't know what it is , Simple Simon the pieman's hat or something. He's had a lot of experience. I think some of the stuff is dreamt. Oh yes, his being every place, Algeria and all around the world and that sort of thing . But that's something else again . That's window dressing. We've met him now at four different places, haven't we?) An' we went to - let's see -6 differen' places at least. I've been to 6 differen ' places trying to catch him. Each time you know you stop at a place they say, \"Well he haven' been here today , go to this address.\" They give me a differen' address, you go there they say , \"Well, he haven't been here, go this other place.\" I wonder if these guys are in the same line of work he's in theirselves. They need these many places as a hideaway for the type of business they' re in. (I don't know, would it be considered illegal here in St. Petersburg?) I don't think so because he had those circulars. (Well yes, he does everything in the name of God. It's part of his religion.) An ' he doesn' charge a fee ••• well in a sense he do, he would charge a fee be-cause he did say he would charge us so much. (Yes. But he couldn 't collect - like a gambler's debt.) But I was wondering too when he says something that he was goin ' to Jamacia, uh, for some sort of conference. (Well now he may think he is. You never can tell.) I think he was very much sincere like he really thinks that is where he's goin' . I wonder if these guys min' is re' lly affected . I mean they get so deep in the work themselves they believe they are gonna do things that they really not gonna do. (It becomes a reality. He wasn't drinking was he? I didn't smell any liquor, he seemd to be quite clear in his mind. He was born in the l owlands of South Carolina, he knows many more superstitions. Of course he says he doesn't believe them now but I was trying to find out whether they were ? in his work. But he used a lot of the old remedies that are known every place.

HYATT What do you mean by a spirituaL person? BROOKER A spirituaL person is not gifted. Ah'm gifted, but ah'm not a spiritual. Ah was in a meeting one time, a little while in Miami. They talked to the dead. [By spirituaL person she means spiritualist. ] CUBBY That's the same Rev. Robinson the one who works with [somebody? The Prophet?]. He' s a spiritualist.

CUBBY Miz Brooker ah wa s amazed the other day , when we [Cubby and Charles] first talked to you. It struck my interest when yo' said something to Charles. Yo ' told him about an ailment that he had. Now this was something that no one knew, and I was goin' to ask you. Do you hav e some kind of perceptive power where you can see things about a person without them even telling you? BROOKER Un huh. Sometime ah can look at yah an' tell what's wrong wit yah. An' then, when ah know what's wrong wit a person, ah lays han's on 'im.

CUBBY AND I HAD INTER-VIEWED THE WHITE TEACHER WE RETURN TO HIS HOME TO DISCUSS BOTH INTERVIEWS. HYATT Mr. Cubby and I are going to make a few notes or comments about the two interviews we had today. At the moment it's fairly quiet but we will prob­ably have a lot of competition. We'll begin with the first woman we had today, Mrs. Brooker. Tell me what you told me before, what she said when you asked her to be interviewed by me. CUBBY She told me that she had to consult the spirit to see if it would be wise for her to give in to this interview . And as she 'fore stated , she wanted to meet you person'ly and judge you also before she would fin'ly make this deci­sion ••• Charles and I stopped over there a week ago. I showed her the books [HOODOO, v.l & 2]. Just before we got ready to leave she told [Char les] that he had a problem on his back that he was concerned about and she could help him if he would come back . It turned out he did have something that was wrong with his back. How she knowed about it, I don't know. HYATT Now, today, what did she do at the very end as we left? After we had stopped the interview and we couldn't take down her words? I said I would give her an offering. CUBBY She tol' yo' not to, she could not take the offerin'. HYATT Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We can't compete with these things. [Motorcycles in background.] All right. CUBBY She told you she couldn't take the offerin' in her han', to place it on the table. She considered this a blessin ' not a offerin'. An' after that when yo' attempted to shake her han' goodbye, she took her lef' han' an' placed it in the pa'm o f your han' ••• Lef' han' under your [right] ••• HYATT The left under, that's right. CUBBY An' the right han' over the top. HYATT And the right hand over the top of my hand. CUBBY Then she begin to say a prayer. HYATT She said a prayer ••• a fairly long prayer. She bles sed me and all sorts of things and ••• CUBBY Blessed the work [we were doing]. Then she prayed fo' the healin' of your han's. HYATT Oh, that's right! She prayed for the healing of my hands! Well, I think ••• [this] is about all we need to say about her. CUBBY Yes. I think the impression itself that she set upon us was somewhat unique. I think at the en d it gave a better - in reality it gave a better under­standin ' of her and her work. At the very end, what she did, rather than the whole interview itself. I think that was the most important part of it all. If we could have gotten that on tape it would have been something wonderful! HYATT Yes. That's unfortunate that we didn't get that on tape but it was there . She's sincere in her work. She knew almost nothing about hoodoo work or anything of that sort. Evidently she doesn't handle anything of that sort. She's a plain healer."},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"4688 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -CUBBY Oh yes. One thing though that I noticed about her, she was very hon­est. When she didn' know about somethin', she didn ' say what she had heard from someone else. She would say , I don' know about it. Somethin' like - she did get right to the point. One good thing about it, she did seem to be quite hones' about everything. DOCTOR WALKER WAS A MYSTERY FROM HIS BIRTH NO ONE INCLUDING HIMSELF KNEW HIS ORIGIN MASTER OF ROOTWORK AND WITCHCRAFT IN CHILDHOOD TAUGHT BY GRANDMOTHER KNOWN AS THE WITCH WHO LIVED IN LARGE HOUSE CALLED WITCH'S CASTLE WITH A STRANGE LIVING COMPANION - A BIRD HALF OWL ON ONE SIDE -HALF BLACKBIRD ON OTHER MEANING WISDOM AND POWER OF DESTRUCTION DOCTOR REFUSED TO SEE ME -ACCEPTED MY ASSISTANTS [I am delighted that the doator decided to avoid me. The amazing reactions of my two assistants, ex-army men and city dwellers, to what they hear and see surpasses any matter-of-fact statements I could have reported. The secret of that half owl and half blackbird -called a famiLiar in witchlore -is examined in large t ype near end of interview itself. Despite Walker's original claim of a mysterious birth, he reveals later that his parents were practitioners of this craft. Among other examples of family inheritance see MY FIRST DOCTOR, vol.2, p.936, 1.36-39.

We are now in Sarasota, Florida, intahviewing the Doator Zemah Walkah [Zemar Walker] from Palmetto, Florida. The voices tha' yo' will heah on this tape will be the voices of Clarence Cubby, that 's mys elf, othah contac' man, Charles Willis [previously called Charles], a an' the voice of Doator Walkah himself. Doator Walkah at this time what ah want yo' to do primarily is to give us an undahstandin' of how yo' got into the work of witchcraf' an' root work. An' a little bit of the background of where yo' come from an' the things of this sort. By this time yo' may have the mike. [Doator Walker speaks very slowly, pausing after each word.] WALKER TO SAY THAT, HOW AH GOT INTO THIS WORK, I CAN 'T REALLY DWELL TOO MUCH ••• IN TELLIN' YO ', BECAUSE AT THE AGE OF ABOUT FIVE YEAHS OLD I HAD COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF ROOT WORK AN' WITCHCRAF '. DEALIN' IN THIS WORK. DIDN'T START REALLY UNTIL ABOUT THE AGE OF ELEVEN. NOW TO EXPLAIN HOW I GOT INTO THIS. MAH GRAND-MOTHAH, WHOM PEOPLE CONSIDERED TO BE A WITCH, SHE LIVED ALONE. YO ' KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE. THEY SAY YOU'RE A WITCH, BECAUSE YO ', YO ' DON 'T MINGLE WITH OTHAHS. NOW MAH GRANDMOTHAH WA S VERY POWAHFUL. SHE WAS A GIFTED WOMAN. SHE HAD POWAH UNLIMITED ••• SHE HAD DWELT IN THIS WE SHALL SAY A CASTLE - NOT REALLY A CASTLE, IT WAS A LARGE, HUGE HOUSE. BUT THE PEOPLE CALL IT THE \"WITCH'S CASTLE. \" SHE HAD ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS AN' IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY IT WAS RELATIVELY YO ' WOULD SAY, HARD TO SEE ANIMALS AROUND, SUCH AS DOG, AND CATS AND BIRDS. CUBBY Yeah. Mr. Walker, just where were yo' born? [Notice the Mr!] WALKER Well not really, as the record show ah was born in Dilton [not in ZIP CODE DIRECTORY] Mississippi, howevah, these records weren't made until ah"},{"pageNumber":930,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -4689 was eleven or twelve, aftah mah grandmothah died , but ah will tell yo' this, no one knows where ah came from [a mystery from the start!]. CU�BY Excuse me Mr. Walkah, how did yo' get your first clue that yo' had this powah? WALKER This was not a clue . CUBBY Mr. Walkah yo' say this is not a clue but yo' have these powahs. Now would yo' explain to us then how yo' got the powah? WALKER WELL, YO' SEE, YOUNG MAN, THESE POWAHS WERE TRANSFERRED TO ME, AN' AH 'FORE [BEFORE] STATED MAH GRANDMOTHAH WA S A VERY POWAHFUL WOMAN. MAH GRANDMOTHAH CALLED ME TO HER SIDE AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN, SHE CALLED ALL OF THE KIDS IN MAH FAMILY AROUND. SHE CALLED MAH MOTHAH AN ' MY FATHAH, AND BY THE WAY, MAH PARENTS ALSO DEALT IN ROOT WORK. BUT SHE TOLD US THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THIS WICKED WORLD ••• TO PART [DEPART] TO A BETTER LAND, AN ' THRU THIS SHE TOLD THEM THAT THE POWAHS IN HER WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO ME. WILLIS Mr. Walkah were the powahs transferred to all the sistahs and brothers or just yo'? WALKER NO, THE POWAHS WERE TRANSFERRED ONLY TO ME. NOW AH DO HAVE A SISTAH WHO CAN TELL FORTUNES, BUT THE POWAH OF THE WORK ••• OF ROOT, WITCHCRAFT WERE ONLY TRANSFERRED TO ME. YO ' SEE WHEN MAH GRANDMOTHAH PASSED AWAY, IT HAS BEEN A MISTRY [MYSTERY) TO EVERYONE. WE CALLED AN' HAD THE UNDAHTAKAH TO COME AND GET HER BODY, BUT AFTAH EMBALMING THE BODY, IT DISAPPEARED FROM THE MORGUE. WILLIS Well, uh just how did your gran'mothah die of old age or what? WALKER NO, AH DON 'T THINK IT WAS OLD AGE ••• THOUGH AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH SHE WAS NINETY-SIX YEAHS OLD. YO ' SEE SHE FORETOLD HER DEATH. AH THINK THE POWAH IN HER WAS GETTIN' TOO STRONG FOR HER FEEBLE BODY. THIS IS WHY SHE TRANS-FERRED THEM TO ME. THIS IS WHAT CA USED HER DEA TH. CUBBY Mr. Walkah, now just a moment ago yo' said that the undertakahs aftah comin' an' gettin' yore grandmothah, that he embalmed her an' she disappeared. Explain that to me just a little bit more. WALKER Well yo' see no one knows where she disappeared. See her undertakah embalmed her, and the last thing they remembahed was that her p�t blackbird flew into the funeral parlah someway. There were no doors or anythin ' open, but they saw the blackbird in there, an' as they chased the bird, leaving h er there o n the table, the bird suddenly disappeared, an' my grandmothah disappeared also. CUBBY Yo' say the bird disappeared an' your grandmothah also? Well do yo ' think the bird probably ate your grandmothah up or somethin '? What, what,what do yo' think about it? WALKER Well, ah don't think that the bird ate her up ••• ah know, but this ••• is something ah can not reveal to yo'. WILLIS But, excuse me a minute Mr. Walkah. Hav e yo' evah seen this bird befo' the time tha ' she disappeared? WALKER Oh yes ••• the bird ••• my grandmothah always kept along with her ••• no mattah where she went. WILLIS Yes, Doctah. Exactly what kind of bird was it? WALKER Have yo' evah seen a blackbird? If yo' have seen an owl it was a combination of a blackb ird an' a owl. [Someone was experimenting with genes before genes were discovered!] CUBBY A combination of a blackbird an' an owl yo' say? Are they, was it, ah mean how was it? Ah mean was it, did it hav e an owl's head or was it just mixed. Ah mean, ah guess ah would say its parent, one was a blackbird and the othah was an owl or somethin' of this sort? WALKER No, if yo' take a bird ••• an' cut it down the centah , take one half, make it an owl, an' the othah side a blackbird an' put it togethah, then you"},{"pageNumber":931,"pageContent":"4690 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundat ion -will have ••• the type of bird that ah speak of. CUBBY Well, was this bird, was this bird unknown in these days or was it frequent to see a bird like this or somethin' of this sort? WALKER No, this is concurred [united] only by mah grandmother [she was th e only person who could put two birds together]. As ah told yo' she had unnatural powahs. Powahs to do anythin' she wanted to do . [HE BEGINS HERE TO MOAN AS HE TALKS AND HIS VOICE TREMBLES.] AH FEEL THE SPIRIT COMING OVAH ME ••• AH MEAN THERE'S EVIL HERE! THEY'RE TRICKERY ••• SOMETHING IS WRONG! SOMETHING� SOMETHING IS WRONG! WILLIS How do you mean somethin' is wrong? [Walker cont inues to moan and talk almost tearfully .] CUBBY We're not trickin' yo' or anything . Ah mean as we explained to yo' befo', this is all legitimate. WILLIS That's, we just compiling some incidents that happened. WALKER NO� BUT THE SPIRIT TELLS ME� THAT I� I AM IN� AH CAN 'T EXPLAIN. [Con­tinues to moan and talks almost tearfully.] CUBBY AT THIS POINT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO JOURNEY BACK TO SARASOTA� AH 'M SORRY� TO PALMETTO WITH MR.

WE'RE GOIN ' BA CK TO GET WITH HIS ASSISTANT� WHILE HE WARDS OFF THIS EVIL SPIRIT THAT IS COMIN' OVAH US AT THIS TIME� WHICH HE SAYS THAT HE FEELS. SO WE'LL BE BACK WITH YO ' AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

WALKER'S SON Well, mah fathah, like he told yo' from the beg innin', he has enormous powahs. He knew that somethin' was wrong . CUBBY What? Ah mean could yo' explain to us .

Ah mean could"},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -4691 yo' explain to us what was wrong? WALKER'S SON No, ah can't. CUBBY Well, could yo' explain to us about these flowahs? Why these flowahs ••. WILLIS Withahed an' died? WALKER' S SON Because evil spirits carry a certain degree of envahment [en­vironment] against flowahs. Notice that in every home what has flowahs that stand up beautiful, the family is happy an' the family is prospaho us. CUBBY So in othah words you're say in' that i f you'r e happy then you're evil? That only evil people are happy? WALKER'S SON No. CUBBY Well, will yo' ansah this question fo' me? Do your family seem to be a happy family? WALKER' S SON Yes, mah family 's happy.

WALKER'S SON He was serious ••• WALKER [Seeing his son in trouble comes in. ] Wait, son, let me explain that. Yo' see, when yo' cast out evil somethin' must die. There was life and there was evil.

Suppose that those flowahs were not in the house? WALKER Yo' say suppose the flowahs would not a [have ] been in the house, is that correct? WILLIS Yes, I mean you said somethin' must die. Seems to me if the flowers weren't in the house ••• oh, oh but you said if the re's an evil among us we might die. But not being evil we would have stayed? Would that be right? WALKER [Talks very softly.] That correct. UH, AH AM FEELIN' ••• A MESSAGE IT 'S COMIN' TO ME NOW! LET MAH SON TALK WITH YO ' A MINUTE. [The doctor tries to get away a few minutes to think.] CUBBY WELL JUST, JUST A MINUTE NOW. BEFO ', BEFO' YO ' SAY ANYTHING MR. WALKAH AH 'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HIS, THESE FLOWAHS. [MR. WALKER GOT OUT OF THE ROOM TOO FAST!] YOUR FATHAH JUST SAID, THAT IF EVIL HAD BEEN IN US WE WOULD HAVE DIED.

Why couldn't it, why couldn't"},{"pageNumber":933,"pageContent":"4692 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -it, why couldn't it have been a, a cat or snake or dog or somethin'? WILLIS Yeah, why did it have to be that? WALKER'S SON Yo' might have known and noticed that in every garden of rest [cemetery?] there 's always flowahs. CUBBY O h yeah! That's correct. Well, in othah words, flowahs, yo' think, ah mean ah don't wanna to ••• WILLIS In othah words a spirit, some type of spirit dwells in flowahs. Is that wha t yo're sayin'? CUBBY Or are yo' say in' flowahs is a symbol of death or somethin'? WILLI S Yeah. CUBBY What are yo' really sayin'? Will yo' explain a little bit, little bettah for us? WALKER'S SON Ah'm sayin ' that flowahs is a symbol of lif e an' death. CUBBY Oh, of life an' death. WALKER'S SON Mm hm. Yo' give flowahs to people who are sick. Yo' give flowahs to those who have gone to rest. WILLIS Ah believe, ah believe kinda of flowahs as immortal. In othah words yo're sayin ' flowahs is some sort of a word of God. Some relig ions symbol of God. WALKER'S SON Oh, noah wouldn't say that. WALKER [Suddenly returns to waiting room. This latter was certainly wired so that he could listen to the conversation within . Perhaps it was actually re­corded . An intercommunication system, legal or illegal is almost a safety meas­ure for any well-known palmist and others alone with all sorts of strangers. To yell for help may not be possible. Evidently Walker thought his son needed help.] Well [says Doator Walker] let me ••• intercede here a minute. The reason those flowahs died was that someone associated with this evil spirit is a great lover of flowahs. Ah did not return the spirit of death on them. Ah returned the spirit of death on the source that was closest to them. CUBBY Yo' returned it to, yo' said, yo' return the spell to that which was closest to them? And you say they are a lover of flowahs. So what you are say­ing is that, uh ••• WILLIS Will all dere flowahs wither too or ••• I mean at dere house? WALKER Yes. That wa s to get it back from whence it came. WILLIS Now , Mr. Walkah, what about the flowahs that is growing, that is rooted in the ground ? At the particulah frame of health? See Doatah? WALKER No. Yo' see ah warded off this evil. It was not a strong evil, therefore all of the cut flowahs died. CUBBY Wait just a minute! Wait just a minute! Ah think this tape is runnin ' a little low on this side so we gonna close out side one of the interview with Mr. Walkah. An' uh before we close out Mr. Walkah ah want yo' on the othah side of the tape, on side two, to give us some experienc e yo've had in root work. An' we want to briefly interview your son about how he got into the work - on side two. So at this time we gonna turn ovah the tape to side two and continue this interview with Doatah Zemah Walkah and his son, which [who] will not reveal his first name to us. [\"This tape ends with very strange noises.

WE'RE ON SIDE TWO OF THIS TAPE WITH THE INTERVIEW OF DOCTAH WALKAH AN' HIS SON. WE WON 'T BE ABLE TO GET \"DOCTAH\" WALKAH HIMSELF ON THIS SIDE OF THE TAPE, BECAUSE HE JUST HAD A RUSH OF PEOPLE TO COME IN WHO WANTED TO GO INTO CONSULTATION WITH HIM!

Charles Willis, and Doctah Walkah's son, whom we can't reveal his, get to reveal his first name, because he is a student in high school, and he re­fuses to be revealed. So at this time, Mr .

So in your own way would ••• WILLIS A few incidents, at least a few people you run a service for, we'd like to know something that yo' did to help? CUBBY So at this time it's all yours.

AH WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE BLIND. [LAUGHS. ] BUT YO ' DO HAVE THE POWAH TO BLIND PEOPLE AND THINGS OF THIS SORT? WALKER'S SON YES. CUBBY Now let me ask yo' a question right here then. Have yo ' evah used your powahs fo' evil? Or do yo ' use 'em jus' fo' good to help people? WALKER'S SON Fo' good. CUBBY Only fo' good? WALKER 1 S SON Yes. CUBBY Oh !

See ah applied fo' jobs, nobody can give me a job an' , when ah did get a job , ah got it wit some people an' they gave me $25 a week fo' bein ' a firs' -class meat cuttah. Ah had a fam'ly tub support. An' this man, he would look at people an ' [as] they come in he would smile at 'em, look at ' em wit his eyes an' his face he's laughin', an' he would cut they throats on the scales. An' fo' $25 per week ah had tub steal somewheah aroun' about 500 or 200 or 1000 dollahs [for the boss]. That short-cuttin' people in the groc'ries-meat depart­ment. An ' ah couldn't make no money at it, so this man made me become a thief -a liah an' a thief. An' ah would take an' steal an ' put meat 'roun' mah wais' an' outsmarted 'im. An' when mine got filled up, mah Frigidaire, then ah went down the road an' began tuh sell it, that ah can have money tub p ay mah insurance an' buy clothes fo' mah fam'ly. An ' aftah that ah met a man one day, he came in an' he called me Brothah [emphasizes BROTHER] Womack. An' aftah he called me Brothah Womack, he had a big seegah [cigar] in 'is mouth, an' had half of t hat . An' he was a big boy, a gang­stab.

No quickah than ah get off from work, seven o'clock he was theah, wit him an' his c'ose [close] partnahs. We went out on the Davis Islan', an' we had a big dinnah out theah. Then he gave me a bow-tie of three bills which wa s a hundad (hundred] dollahs each. [Gave him 3 $100 bills tied together like a bow-tie .] Well, ah was feelin' good. So then he gave me a job. A big job that ah' ve had contac's. An' ah contac' an' stayed wit this man 'til one day ah heard a voice say ah was anointed tub preach the Gospel.

An' yet, still, that one day, mah mo­thah tole me, said, \"Son, yo've got tub be sanctif ied an' filled wit the Holy Ghost·, an' that wit fiah.\" An' this was on Christmas Day, 1946. Ah tole mah mothah, ah said, \"Mothah, yo' saved, yo' say yo' sanctify,\" ah said , \"so let evrah individual celebrate like they want tub celebrate.\" Tha's what ah tole mah mothah. Ah kiss mah mothah. Ah walked out. Goin' ovah tub ano thah preach­ah's house that we would start tub drinkin' a li' le bit, preparin' fo' the big ceremony on the Christmas evenin'. An' when ah started 'cross the road, ah got knocked out sure 'nough. Some­thin' hit me. An' when this thing hit me an' ah arose, people were standin' ovah me. An ' ah said , \"Who in the hell h it me?\" Ah heard a voice said , \"Ah hit chah. Go home an' call Jesus.\" An' when ah went home, ah called Jesus. Mah wife was right behind me say, \"Wha' the mattah darlin'?\" Ah say, \"Damn if ah know.\" But somethin ' got aholt of me. An' ah began tub say, \"Jesus,\" goin ' from room tub room .

Ah took a bath. Evrahthin ' looked diff'ren'. An' ah asked, \"what's goin' on around heah? Ah look at the clouds, they diff'­ren', yo' diff' ren'.\" Ah say , \"What 's wrong ?\" An' when ah ask 'er what 's wrong, she say, \"Ah don' know honey, ah don' see no diff'ren' .\" Ah say, \"Well, hell, let's go tub the barroom an' get drunk. Ah'm gon'a pitch a bitch tuhnight.\" Ah was a sinnah. See? But mah name was on the churchouse roll. Ah was a big Christian in the church when ah found that ah was a sinnah. An' then, we went tub the barroom an' ah bought a fi'th o' whiskey . An ' aftah ah bought this fi't h of whiskey, it was \"Ole Thompson,\" an' we went ovah tub the prea chah's house an' ah began tub set up theah . When ah wanted tub drink, ah opened the whiskey . They drank it all up becuz ah say it stinks [I took none] so they looked on me an' say, \"What 's wrong?\" Ah say, \"Ah don't know. Ah can't stan' it.

HE TOLE ME TUH BUILD HIM A TEMPLE. An' when God tole me tuh build 'im a temple, ah started tuh go down an' in­quiah how can this be. But ah found out that God didn't want me tuh inquiah from anybody how He want me tuh do it. All ah had tuh do wus wait on time an' have faith in God. So at that pahticulah time, that ah had faith in God, a woman came ovah tuh me one day wit'in about three weeks an' she had a lot [vacant piece of land ] an' her boyfrien' had got in jail an' she say she didn't have a frien' no wheah an' asked me would ah buy this lot.

An' he let them know if God - he tole me if God tole yo' tuh build it, build it, but if God say yo' don' build it, yo' can't build it. SO AH WENT ON AN' BUILT THE CHURCH - ONE MAN WITOUT ASKIN' ANY­BODY FO ' A DIME. AH WORKED THROUGH PROPHESY AN' HEALIN '. AN' PEOPLE WOULD COME IN AN' JIS ' BLESS ME AN' THAT. AN' AH BEGAN TO GO ON� AN ' GO ON, AN' GO ON, IN MAH MINISTRY AN' TEACHIN' AN' PROPHESIAHIN' [PROPHESYING]. THEAH'S MANY FALSE ACCUSATIONS HAS COME AG'INST ME. AH BEEN CAST IN JAIL, AH'S BEEN NEVAH FOUND GUILTY OF ANY CRIMES. THEY KLU KLUX [KLAN] CAME FO ' ME� BUT AH STILL PREACHED THE GOSPEL. An ' by faith that ah have found out, wit 'in God, that all things is possible . All things! An' we might heah, ah've heard a lot of preachahs that say they nevah did this, an' nevah did that, but we all has been sinnahs. Even much of the Psalms, the P salms, the fi'th, eighth song of Dav id, second verse, ah say , \"From our mothah's womb that we were born liahs. An' waved our han's when we wus born into this world.\" [Psalm 116:11 ?]. So wit hin me, ah have found out in mah religious work, that the dead has been raised .

THE"},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -4707 CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS, IS LEADIN' MO ' OF US TO HELL AN ' DESTRUCTION. EVEN MUCH IN OUR SCHOOLS AN ' COLLEGES OF TUHDAY, THE EDUCATION IS NOT THE ANSWAH. CHRIST IS THE ANSWAH, BECUZ 0' ALL THE EDUCATION YO ' CAN FIN ' THAT PEOPLE HAVE, AN ' THEY SAY THEY HAS, YO ' CAN FIN ' THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH A VAR 'ATION FROM GOD. UNLESS AMERICA DO COME BACK TUH GOD WE ALL GONNA LIKEWISE PERISH. That 's the experience that ah've had. Ah'm Intahdenomination Ministerial All iance. Yo' had a Meth'dist talkin' about the Baptist, the Baptist say it about the Meth'dist. They are so much depahted, they are divided. Cath'lics. Ah go amongst the Jews, the wimmins have me tub pray fo' 'em. The Jews don' bel ieve in Christ, but they say they believe in God. But the Bible s ays in Numbahs, the 6th chaptah, in the 2nd and the 3rd verse, \"When a man he must make a vow, tub be come tub God, don' drink no wine, no strong drinks, neither no liquah, the diff' rence between holy an' unholy.\" An' now we walks down the aisle, say this is the Lord's Suppah, \"As much as yo' do this yo' showin' his suffahin' an' death, until He come.\" Well, the man now say God is dead. Bu t if we gonna say we can eat the Lord's Suppah showin' his suffren [suffering] an' death, God is dead. Where is the resurrection say, when yo' has put on Christ, that's all we need. We don' need anythin ' but a dollah tub live in this worl'. Natu'lly so. But spir't u'lly so, that we all need tub come back tub the spir'­tu'l fold. It remind me o' the time when Nicodemus, he had all the things that he needed, all he wanted. He had men tub say , \"Come.\" He had men tub say, \"Go.1 1 H e had the powah tub fiah an' hiah. But one time he foun' out that wit all that he had he was lackin' a t somethin'. An' that wus Christ. We need Christ. An ' ah foun' tuhday that mos' we ministahs we need Christ. We drink, we chew, we smoke, we whoremongah, we lie, there's all kinda evil communication ag' inst us, right in the body of Christ. An' we say that we are Christians. An ' tuhday that ah've found we are gettin' worse. We do worsah, worsah than the mafia gang , whethah we wan'a believe it or not. They say the mafia gang: an' the mafia gang this, the mafia gang that. But when it comin' tuh help in so many political affairs, who d o we have tub back us up financially? This is some­thin' tub think about. Do yo' think these men is runnin' fo' office, if they make that, where are they gonna get the money from? This is somethin' tub think about. Ah have been out theah intuh the fiel'. Ah've worked wit those big men . An' those men will give so many thousands of dollahs tub the Red Cross, tuh give so many thousands of dollahs fo' a man's runnin' fo' office. This one backin' up the three rings. One back up a man ovah heah. One back up a man ovah theah. An' then -but when we get greedy an' call ourselves, if yo' don' pay it, yo're free tub put this man in office an' ah get greedy enough tuh go an' try tuh ovah­ride yo'. Then yo' know good an' well what's goin' tuh be the cons equences. See? So this is it. An' it 's the same way they are worsah in the churches of tuhday as a whole. Ah don' mean tuh say one, becuz they are commercializin'. Nothin' but money : money , money, money. An' what we need today is Christ. An' if we don't go back intuh the old landmark, ah believe it jis' like the Bible said, \"Follah peace wit all mankind,\" Hebrew 12 :14, \"An ' holiness witout which no man shall see the Lord [reference correct]. CUBBY Is, excuse me. Bishop Womack. Could you in any way give us any spe­cific example that you healed? BISHOP WOMACK Oh healed? Well, we will have heah Brothah James Knowles, Brothah Knowles .

BISHOP WOMACK Well it 's, it's they got tub have some frien's, yo ' know, what yo ' may say spys. Yo' remembah they - Rahab the Harlot. Remembah she was a great whore an ' evahthin ', but that woman had God in her. Yo ' remembah that when she seen these two spys comin' an ' runnin' from that host of army of devils, that she wen' in herself. It had tub be GOd touchin'. That inward man [woman here! ] was touched. An ' when that inward man [woman] was touched she had these men tub come in an ' they, she concealed these men. An ' all o' her frien's, she turned 'em down. Takin ' a chance of givin' up her life of the worl' to become a 'postle of Jesus Christ. [This is stretching things a bit!] So, ah think that when we look intuh these things, then we has a bettah view of life that the time gon'a come an ' it mus ' come, that when a man must change his way, see, if yo ' wan'a make it . An' that's what ah can see about Rahab the Harlot. HYATT Now did they, you said , in putting these Apostles' [names] on the cards, did they write the Apostles ' names on a piece of paper, or [here ] pictures of 'em or ••• BISHOP WOMACK Yo ' take a leaf, y o' could take uh leaf, uh what yo' call a fig leaf. Yo ' could take a piece of pahchment papah. Yo ' remembah the time, ah think in I Timothy , 4th chaptah in 'roun ' about the 13th verse, that when Apostle Paul , he had jis' left Troas an' he left his cloak theah. An ' when he lef' the cloak theah he wrote back to Titus . Yo' remembah? [The cloak in II Tim.v.13.] HYATT Yes. BISHOP WOMACK An' he tole him tub bring the cloak that which he lef ' at Troas an ' the books an' especially the pahchment. Well, yo' know, take good pahchment is made out of deer-hide. An ' there are many things that yo ' could do by writ­in ' , an' all the lettahs was write on pahchment, yo' remembah? HYATT Um hum. BISHOP WOMACK An ' right today there is many things that we can use as apos­tles of Jesus Christ, an' write on pahchment tub do great works, through the powahs of God, if yo ' know. Yo ' see? That' s where the ministry come in tub study, not tub take the Gospel down to satisfy people. Speak the truth an' speak as an oracle of God. An ' when a man speak as an oracle of God, regardless tuh what the church think about choo. See wha' ah'm talkin' about? Yo ' can outlive them, 'cuz yo ' belong tub the church that Christ died fo' . But organizations, ah don't know whethah God evah been in 'em any mob. If he has once been in 'em, He don' har'ly be in 'em anym�, becuz there's no brothahly love no moh. We go then an ' says we has fellahship one wit anothah tub see what? See? What 's so-an '-so got on? What ah've heard 'em ask the quest ion : What did the dogs throw last night? What was the numbah? What did you write in for the Church? The church now is in the worl 'y lus ' [lust ]. It's the house of commer­cializin' , not the House of Prayah. But remembah in Isaiah, I think about 57, 56 and 7 [56:7] that Jesus said, \"Mah House shall be called a House of Prayah for all nations.\" Well, yah see where all nations if they could get tuhgethah we won ' have the strife an ' the torment wit race tuhday. We won' have those bloody wahs of hate. This man wan 'a become powahful wit dominion of the worl' becuz that wasn' given tub 'im tub start wit . God gave evrah man a supply as He did see fit. But now that we got these wahs an.' thin's comin' on, we notice that in the Temple they talkin' about commercializin ' tuhday, but they did it when Jesus was here. Ah think about the 21st chaptah in the 13th verse of the Gospel of St. Matthews. Yo' remembah that when Jesus came intuh the Temple they was sellin' an' rattlin' [confusing ] folks tuh hell an ' doin' all o' this thing . An ' Jesus jis' went in theah, took a rope an ' ovahturned the tab les an' went tub beat the Devil out of theah .

But see, we are goin' intuh the merchandise catagory of tuhday when these thin's shouldn't be. We must come back tub prayah. HYATT Before I forget it, you were talking about these people trying to put you in jail and all that sort of thing. Did you ever have any trouble with hoo­doo people, voodoo; witch people, witch? Ever had any trouble with them? Did they ever call you a witch people, witch? Ever had any troub le with them? Did they ever call you a witch doctor or anything of that sort? BISHOP WOMACK Well, I mean, as far as calling me a root man •.• HYATT Well, that's something different. BISHOP WOMACK Yeah, the root man becuz people don' realize what the root man is. HYATT A doctor, well a doctor can use roots. I mean an ordinary medical man can use roots, medicine, drugs and that sort of thing . BISHOP WOMACK But let's look at from this angle. HYATT All right. BISHOP WOMACK Revelations, the 22nd chaptah in the 16th [actually 18th] verse. The Bible said, \"Ah, Jesus, have set mah angle tub testify these things intuh the churches. That ah am the root an' offspring of David an ' the Bright in the Morn­ing star.\" So if a man is a root man he got somethin' • He got somethin' the average man don't have. HYATT That 's right. BISHOP WOMACK BUT WHEN YO 1 COMIN' DOWN TUH CUNJURE, VOODOO, AN ' WITCHCRAF' ••• HYATT OH YES, TO CUNJURE ••• BISHOP WOMACK ••• THESE ARE THE THIN'S THAT WHICH AH FIGHTS AG 'INST AN' THESE ARE THE THIN'S THAT PEOPLE COME TUH ME ABOUT TUH HELP THEM. AN' EVRAHBODY KNOW WHEN HE NEEDS HELP, WHEN THEY GOT LOBSTAH AN' FROGS AN ' ALL THESE DIFF'REN KINDS OF THIN'S INTUH THEY BODY. AH HAD A MAN UP HERE, A WHITE FELLAH, HE COME UP HEAH FROM WILDWOOD. AN' AH GOT FROGS AN ' SNAKES OUT OF 'IM. AN' HE BROUGHT ME NICE SUMS OF MONEY BUT AH GAVE IT BACK TUH 'IM BECUZ AH DIDN'T KNOW WHETHAH THE MONEY WA S COUNTAHFEIT OR NOT. YO ' SEE WHAT AH MEAN? BECUZ YO ' GOT TUB BE SO CAREFUL ABOUT THESE THING'S. HYATT Now, you were talking about a white man. You have, what percentage of white people would come to you in comparison with colored people? Ten percent of white people? Or I've been told [by those who] talk about people who believe in witchcraft, that sort of thing, that a colored man 50 percent, and some said white man 50 percent. A lot of people believe in that, you know? BISHOP WOMACK Well yo ' know, this is the way thin's that operate. The white man have the money, the black man don't. The white man come, he c an pay yo' . But the average black person come here, it's a dollah, two dollahs, that 's the best they can do. HYATT That 's right. BISHOP WOMACK But the white man come an' it's a hundred tub hundred an' fifty dollahs. Yah see what ah'm talkin' about? Right now ah got a beautiful twenty dollah gold piece ovah theah [in the house]. It' s consecrated fo ' him becuz he tole me himself. Now they has these spiritua lists. White people they calls 'em. Voodoo doctahs. An' witch doctahs . Which they studah lotta occult powah. An' this white man, right in this town, he' s an outs tandin' man, a big man in this town. His boy got intuh trouble. An' aftah his boy got intuh, he went tub some of these white people an ' he told me he spent ovah $40, 000. See what ah mean? An' they couldn't do nuthin fo' him. So he came out here becuz somebody sent h� tuh me an' $60 he left wit mah wife. An' his boy is a free boy tuhday. CUBBY Did you get him out of prison or something?"},{"pageNumber":954,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -4713 BISHOP WOMACK Keep him from goin' tuh jail becuz prayah change thin's. See yo' can reach, prayah can reach yo' anywhere. Yo ' see what ah'm talkin' about? When yo' pray an' ask God tub let the judge tub be lenient, see, wit such-an'­such a person, yo' prays fo' this judge. See wha' ah' m talkin' about? An' when a man can pray, an' yo' can feel that unction of Gawd, that spiritual powah com­in' down, it goin ' tuh that man. As well as Jesus said in the 22nd chaptah , think 15 an' 21 an' 22. [The Bish­op would have been correct had he switched the numbers to 15: 22-28 of Matthew, story about the Canaanite woman whose daughter had an uncl ean spirit or devil. This story given at an earlier date by Mark 7:24-30.] Yo' remembah how this woman had been so rich. An ' she had all the money an' all the doctahs an' all the palmists an' all the soothsayahs as long as she had all huh money . That they would go theah tub see huh, they was great frien's. So she put evrahthin' ahead o' God. But one day -see God knew how tuh touch all of us. So this woman loved her daughter Sapera [unnamed in Bible] above God. An' one day a spell of sick­ness fell on huh daughtah. An ' when the spell of sickness fell on huh daughtah, she got broke . She did n't have no friend in the worl'. See? An ' Jesus was passin' through that day. An' as He an' His disciples was goin' through, she hollahed, \"Oh Lord. Oh Lord have mercy on me.\" Jesus cont inued to go on, as though he went 'round about two or three blo cks. Then this woman cried out again, \"Oh Lord , Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.\" So Petah hollahed, \"Lis­ten tuh huh callin' us.\" Petah didn't have nuthin but he was fellahin' Chris'. So Jesus immediat ely turned aroun ' an' went back tuh this woman, an' looked on huh an' tole huh, \"It's not lawful tuh give the holy bread tub the dogs.\" But this woman, she knew what she was talkin' about. An' Jesus knew [what] she was talkin' about. But He wan'a see how 'umble she was. She tole Jesus, she said, \"Lord, the mastah give the dogs the crum's from His table.\" Yo' see what ah mean? \"An' ah'm your dog[!]. Ah've 'umble mahself. See, now ah'm askin' Yo'.\" An' Jesus said, \"Glory tuh God, halleluiah! Ah haven't found no mo ' faith in Isra'l than ah have found in this woman.\" Huh. \"At this very hou' [hour] thy daughtah is made whole.\" See? 'Cuz when yo' can pray , an' yo' can reach God through prayah , yo' can tell it. Yo' can feel that spiritual unction. Ah don' care who it is. An' when yo' can feel it, then yo' know God have answah prayah. IF YO ' DON ' FEEL THAT SPIRIT'AL POWAH� YO ' STAY THEAH [where you were] AN' 'UMBLE YO 'SELF. 'CUZ A LOT OF TIMES WE GOT TUB I'ON [IRON] THE WRINKLES OUT O' OUR LIFE: WE MIGHTA TALK TOO MUCH, WE RAD MIGHTA HEARD TOO MUCH� WE MIGHTA HA VE SEEN TOO MUCH.

CUBBY Oh, I was gonna ask him about this Apostles. Yo' have me a little stummed [stumped]. You started to explain it an' then we asked yah anothah ques­tion about it. Were you, were you saying that you know when the people put the Twelve Apostles in the car? Do yah have to get something that signifies one o' the Apostles , yo' know , something that dealt with the Apostles in the Bible to represent them? Yo' know, when they do this do they [use] like uh fig? Yo ' said somethin' about a fig leaf. [Usua lly the names of the 12 Apostles are associated with sage leaves: Nos.8480 , v.4; 9124-9137, v.4; and elsewhere.] BISHOP WOMACK Now wait. Yo' see, here's the thing about that. When it [these rites are] comin' down, a lot of people that's ignorant, they heah things. As though yo' an' ah discussed this mawnin' about men , say they're preachahs. An' they are commercializin '.

An ' all this kinda stuff. But people'll say, Well, we'll take the Apos­tles. See what ah mean? An' yo'll do this an' do that. But it's not so. See, yo' do not take the Apostles an' do any wrong things. But if yo' ign'ant tub the fac' , yo' see what ah'm talkin' about, if yo' ign'ant tuh the fact, yo' don' know any bettah. HYATT In other words, if a person came to you and wanted you to put a spell on someone, you wouldn't put a spell on anybody. BISHOP WOMACK Ah couldn't do it. HYATT You couldn't do it.

An' ah couldn't love nobody more in mah family but more than ah love yo'. See, God died fo' sinnahs. See, this is wheah the church come in. A lot a people say they did n't go tub church 'cuz yo's a Cath'l ic. Yo' see wha' ah'm talkin' about? Yo's a Presby­terian, yo' this an' yo' that.

CUBBY May I, may I ask you a question? Now what is the majah diff ' rence be­tween root work and witchcraft? BISHOP WOMACK Well, yo' take, well yo' see, that people call root work witch­craft becuz they nevah has been taught. If yo' will accept the precepts of roots, yo' look at this tree . Wit'out this tree, wit'[out] the roots it couldn't sur­vive. Wit' out the root bein' in yo', yo' couldn't survive. Yo' undahstan ' what ah mean? But people haven't been taught. Ah jis' said, yo' are the root an' the offspring of David. Tha's Jesus Christ. An' we are the offspring of Christ. Yo' see what ah'm talkin' about? All right.

It's the best thing fo' yo' tuh be a good Samaritan, than it is fo' yo' tuh be the devil of a Samaritan . Yo' see what ah mean? See, the Devil can do many thin's. But it won' hold out.

See, an' tha's why ah can say, people is people. Ah don' care what colah yo' are an' what not. Yuh blood is red. The Bible say , Acts 17:26: \"Out o' one blood God made all nations to dwell upon the face of the Earth [quotation correct].\" So we want to see the blood of Jesus. An' Acts 2:42: \"An' all o' God's people continued into one doctrine.\" Is that right or wrong? [Quotation approxi­mately correct for chapter and verse.] HYATT That's true. BISHOP WOMACK Well yuh see, that 's what the Bible said. HYATT Well the reason I asked you this, sometimes when they're digging up this treasure they, they want a preacher to come, to be reading the Bible or pray ing or something while [they are digging] . They're afraid of the spirits. BISHOP WOMACK Well, that's the thing about it. People are afraid of the spirits. Ah went out one night wit a man, an' ah think it was out from Hysperdes [Hesperides?] an' ah had this much experience. We had some dogs, we was huntin' . An' ah don' know, but the dogs begin tub bark an' hollah an' run tub an' fro . An' , but we all was sinnahs out dere. We say we was Christians, we all were sinnahs. An' do yo' know, ah saw somethin' fell out the tree? An' when it did , the dog ran down theah at it an' when, when they came back they hoopin' an' hollahin' . An' mah fathah say , \" We bettah get outa heah. It look like somethin ' jis ' went on ovah our head!\" Like this. An' we got nervous . An ' we went tub jumpin' ovah the fence an' evahthin', an ' mah fathah an' all o' them got scared an' went tuh the highway. An' ah went tuh the car. An' ah had tuh drive the car becuz they're spirits whethah people believe it or not. There are spirits. [For similar hunting stories , especially the opossum, see Nos.234-237, p.65, and probably elsewhere.] But these people want me tub go down tuh the Spr ing. They believe ah have enough of God in me, an' ah know ah have enough God. If ah can set heah , ah can c011DD.une wit God. Yuh see in Psalm 4 an' 4, David say, \"How ah lie down an' ah commune with God [this verse says \"commune with your own heart\"]. Then ah think Solomon was one amongst the greatest men, that was evah down heah jis' naturally so [without any command from God] that he said how he stayed theah, Songs [Song of So lomon ] 1 and 18, how he communed with God. [Since there is no Song of Songs or So lomon's Song 1:18 or chapter 18, we must assume the Bishop means the whole song or book. Though the Christian Church for centur ies has wrung its hands in despair trying to allegorize the human love of this love classic , the Bishop rightly sees human love as communion with God!] Then we read in the 12th chaptah of Acts Apostles where, when Peter was theah c ommunin' wit God, an' they had killed James jis' befo' Eastah. Yo' see what ah'm talkin' about? An' by him c ommunin' wit God, then God sen' an' angel from heav en an' unloosed him [from prison] an' say , \"Rise, an' get outa heah quickly.\" An' when he went, yo ' know, he went tub this house wheah these mothahs wuz havin' prayah. So this is the thing, that what ah mean tub say, that we need tuh come back [to a better religion?], Yo' see, if yo' gonna be a ministah, ah think the Bible says in Acts 20:28, \"Take heed therefo' unto yo' self in which the Holy Ghost has made yo' ovahseeahs tub feed the Church of God\" [this is near enough to original]. So see, it's onlah [only] one church, as far as ah'm concerned. See? An' then when a man has gone in it, yo' don' have tuh realize [what does realize mean here?] that nothin' yo' gonna speak or say , Becuz yo' know ah think the 14th chaptah o' St. John in the 16th verse he sa y, \"An' ah pray tub the fa­thah that He would give yo' anothah comfo' tab\" [reference 0.

I was gon'a tell yo' to ask him about this altar, yo' know, that most of the healers use. Yo' prob'ly could explain it tuh 'em [him] better about the altar . HYATT Well, a person in healing, some people use altars. Bu t that's primari­ly down around new Orleans where they'r e in a Roman Catholic atmosphere, where people have more belief in the altar an' the use of candles. Now the people around here also use candles but we use them in a little bit different way. It all depends on what you are using. You [the Bishop] primarily are using prayer alone. That 's the main thing. A fellow was telling us the other day about his grandmother who had ability to do root work and all that sort of thing. And they called her a witch. The people didn't know what she was doing. She was associated with a blackbird that was half blackbird and half owl. Did you ever hear of that? Then when she died the undertaker put her on the table and was getting ready to lay her out and this blackbird-owl got into the undertaking parlor and all that sort of thing and when they went in there this blackbird-owl had left and this woman had disappeared. Now he's try ing to say some way that she and that blackbird, they are connected in some way. CUBBY The blackbird was a spirit of her, is that it?

[And now follows a very unusual version of the disappeaPing hitchhikeP!] BISHOP WOMACK Now ah wuz comin' out of Wil' berry intuh Tampa one day an' there wus a ole lady that ah saw an' she asked me tub let 'er ride intuh Tampa wit me. HYATT Uh huh. [Here comes a new and interest ing version of a story I first heard on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 1936. See margin title SUDDEN DIS­APPEARANCE, Nos .73 & 74, p.3 0f., vol.l.] BISHOP WOMACK An' when ah got jis' about intuh Tampa ah looked an' ah didn't see this woman. HYATT In your car? BISHOP WOMACK Ah didn't even see 'er. Ah didn't even see this woman an' tha ' happen on sev'ral occasions. HYATT This is side three of cassettes. We're recording Bishop Womack's ex­periences and beliefs and we're going to talk now. He says he does use an altar . BISHOP WOMACK Yes. HYATT How? Tell me again. Begin there with Revelations . That was very interesting. Repeat the Revela tions, then bring in the altars and candles. BISHOP WOMACK Ah have an altah in mah house. An' the reason that ah have an altah in mah house, that Jesus said in Revelations, 'roun' about the 22nd chaptah, the 17th an' 18th verse, he said, \"If any man should add tub the pPoph­esies book, he's gon'a add the plagues which is in it. An' if any man shall take away from the pPophet's book, that he is gon'a take out [be taken out of] the book of life. [Preceding reference is Rev.22:18-19.] So in mah experience, an' ah mean true experience, that he says this in the 8th chaptah of Revelations[?] beg innin' from 1st throughout 5th[?] verse, \"An' where they opened the seal of God, he said, the secon' angel brought in myrrh, he brought incense an' canel­sticks.\" Well we know that canelsticks [candles ticks ] yo' use for canels [can­dles]. [As you know, there were no candles and candlesticks in Biblical times,"},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -4721 as these words in the King James version of the Bible suggest, candles not yet having been invented. This is why the English and later the American Revised Versions changed the word candle to lamp, normally a small clay bowl with handle and spout, and float-wick in olive oil.] An ' this incense. An' so, when yo' go befo' God an' yo' pray , befo' God evah mo' nin' [morning] anoint yuh head wit oil. Any man can do it, if yo' was tub take this incense an' wit chere canels.

Wit all these dif feren' things, ah mean ah can go along on an' jis' tell yo' the contents of the many thin's that which ah have had exper ience. Yo' can burn canel when yuh chil'ren are sick, an' when loved one is goin' befo' the judge an' what not, an' God will have mercy an' compassion, becuz the Bible says, that when yo' do these thin', heaven is opened an' the saints of God, the prayah goes up through the smoke, then yo ' know good an' well yo' an' ah don' know wheah the smoke is goin' tub, but then God honah that through his saints. But we notice that othah churches an' thin's has used lot'a canels an' ah think that this has been a great blessin' through the Cath'­iic organization a ll the way down in mah experience. Fo' it's finances [finan­cial] affairs they will use this -in they services, which ah don' blame. It is really good an' y'all can try it. All, y'all can try it when yo' go home an' yo' will fin' that when yo' will pray , that yo' grow strong in powahs wit God. See? HYATT By the way, have you ever, as far as you know, have you ever had any-one of the Roman Catholic f aith come to you? BISHOP WOMACK Yes. HYATT For advice? BISHOP WOMACK Yes. Yes. HYATT Well, tell me about an experience of that type. I mean are they sup­posed to come to you? I sn' t that committing a sin against their church, or what? BISHOP WOMACK Well let me tel l yo' somethin' that ah have found out about man. We have all had a weakness in our life, an' has a sick mess. Ah don' care what kinda organization yah be in, there's a sickness 'mongst all. An' ah have had Cath'lics come tub me becuz ah was in a great healin' meeti n'. An ' durin' the healin' meetin', these people was out theah. An' they didn' have any money jis' like the othah people didn't hav e none, but yet still they didn' wan'a suf­fah. So when they came in -an' we had such a great healin' meetin' -then they went back tub the pries t an' they tole me they was gain', becuz we had Scriptures there on what we was doin'. So when they went back tub the priest, the priest say , \"Well, if yo' wan'a go wit t he Bishop Womack yo' jis' go o n wit 'em.\" Say, \"We don' have no doubt o' what the man is doin',\" he said, \"but this not our way o' doin' thin's.11 Well that was very honest, ah think, in them comin' back an' the priest sayin' it. HYATT Uh huh, fine. BISHOP WOMACK All right. It the same way about Jews. Ah deal wit a lot o' Jews. Ah was ovah theah in Tampa the othah day intuh the St. Joseph's Hospital. That's the one ah think ah had been in Buffalo [New York]. An' intuh these dif­f'ren' p laces there are quite [a number] o' Jews ah have dealin ' wit. Now, they don' supposed tub eat any po'k they said. See what ah mean? An' they don' be­lieve in Jesus C hrist. Now that what they tell me but they believe in God. Well, though they believe in God an' not in Jesus Christ, but they have me tub come in an' pray fo' 'em becuz ah believe both. Ah believe Jesss Christ is God's own son. An ' ah believe wit'in mahself, acco 'din' tub St. John , 10 an' 30, that Jesus said , \"Ah an' Mah fathah is One.\" [Reference correct. ] Ah believe in"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"4722 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundat ion -the 17th chaptah of S t. John, that when Jesus prayed the prayah, said, \"Lord, make us One\" [verse 11] . An' that's wha t ah wan'a be. Ah wan'a be one wit the brothahhood. So, an' when this woman would get sick, they sen' fo ' me. Ah hap­pened tuh be in the hospital othah day ovah theah an' the rabbi was theah . An' when the rabbi was theah, he went fo' a check. [Be careful Bishop! I am sure you mean he went to aheak her health and not to receive a aheak meaning money!] She didn' ask him tuh pray , but befo' ah left she asked me tuh pray fo' 'er. An' ah picked up her in mah arm [put an arm about her ] an' ah prayed fo' 'er -this was a Jew woman-in the Name of Jesus . An' when ah prayed f o' 'er she said , \"Thank you.\" Then she gave me a check of $3.00. She say , \"Ah feel a lots bet­tah.\" Well now she has been operated on an' she' s do in' fine.

BISHOP WOMACK An' he said , \"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\" in prayah, then said, \"The check.\" An' when he lef' out, then she ask me tuh pray fo' 'er. [All laugh. This probably included me. The Bishop was an actor, and these 9 bZahs were too much to remain silent.] An' ah put mah arm ••• HYATT She gave him his check, maybe she was afraid not to, and then -but she really wanted you to do the pray ing? [Cont inues to laugh.] BISHOP WOMACK Yeah, she really wanted me tuh do the pray ing. An' us, ah mean, an' by doin' the prayin', well ah mean she comes ovah tuh mah house right now. An' she'll be ovah, this week supposed tuh be comin' up. An' she come ovah an' they sit down an' they talk a lots wit me becuz, a ccordin ' tuh the Jew­ish faith i ts [the faith is] undahneath the laws of God. An' we notice in Num­bahs the 6th chaptah in the second an' the third verse, \"Now [if you gon'a be so technical] God tole yuh don' drink no likah, no wine or no strong drinks.\" [Ref­erence correct.] Now God said that. But when yo' go ovah theah, ah been ovah uh they big feasts. An' yo' know what they have? They have nuthin but wine of all kin' an' smokin ' of all kind an' they have cakes an' grapes. So, yo' see when it comin' down tuh diagno shin' [diagnosing] man, as ah have had experience in it, ah don' pay man no min', don' care who he is, whethah he's priest, bishop, or t he ? • Ah don' pay none of 'em no min'. Only one thing ah see. Ah wanna see God in 'im, an' by his works . That's why ah think Jesus made this statement so plain. When they say becuz he was a Jew an' this an' that yo' come tuh con­demn the laws of Mo ses . But Jesus say in John roun' about 7:16 says, \"If yo'd [you had] knowed Me, yo'd [you would] known whethah it was Mah doctrine or whethah it was o' God.\" [It was actually John 7:17.] He said , \"Did not Moses give yo' the law an' yet none of yo' kept the law? Why go about to kill me?11 [John 7:19. ] What ah feel though, this what we should [do] is let our work shine befo' men. Evrabody has the same min' an' same conscience whethah we use it or not. An' if we wuz tuh do that -don' yo' know if yuh hand was cut off tuhday an' yo' see yuh babies out dere, some a loved ones -yo' see them out there wit their leg cut off -yo' know good an' well yo' want somebody tuh do somethin' good fo' it. But undahneath the law, we are supposed tuh go an' stay in our house an' when the day of the fea st, we supposed [to] go out theah an' get stuff an ' bring it in, but we don' go out on the Sabbath day ."},{"pageNumber":964,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -4723 HYATT Yes, I know. BISHOP WOMACK But tuhday we has a greatah thing in the Sabbath that's the Lord wit'in [within] man. An' if we got Chris' wit'in us, then we wan'a let our light so shine. So ah don ' pay no 'tention hardly tub what man say, regardless about his relig ion affiliation. Religion is only a duty. James 1:27 an' 28 say religion is a duty. Tub visit the widows an' do benevolence tub the orphan , then r endah yo' know untuh the sick. Visit the sick an' all this diff' ren ' thing [reference is somewhat similar].

Now [that is] accordin ' tub Galatians, the 3rd chaptah in the 8th an' the 9th verse [quotation correct].

BISHOP WOMACK Let the spirit express itself as it see fit. HYATT That's right. 4727 BISHOP WOMACK Yah see. An' as for us speaking in tongues, Chr ist spoke in tongues on the cross. HYATT That's right. [I am mer ely agreeing with him here. This was not speaking with tongues.] BISHOP WOMACK Eli, Eli, bla, blah, whew! Jesus have mercy! Christ spoke in tongues on the cross, becuz he was dyin' fo' mah an' yuh sin. An' ah've foun' this out. In mah experience, THE NIGHT THE LO 'D JIS ' KNOCKED ALL THAT OUTA ME [p.4705], AH SPOKE IN TONGUES. IT 'S NOT OFTEN. BUT WHEN AH GET SO HIGH INTUH THE SPIRIT SOMETIMES, AH BEGIN TUH SPEAK THINGS AH DON ' KNOW NOTHIN' ABOUT, BUT PEOPLE BE 'S HEALED. Ah seen 'em speak in tongues.

HYATT Sometimes if you are speaking in tongues, can some other person explain what you are say ing? BISHOP WOMACK Ah have been a intahpretah . Now, we must take the Bible fo' what the Bible says. All right, yo' take I Corinthians, 14, 27, and 28 [ref­erence correct]. Yo' take Galat ians, the 3rd chaptah, the 4th chaptah , the 11th an' 12th verse.

So now, if we gonna preach the Bible about Jesus Christ save, ah don' see why should we wan'a condem' the intahpretah of the church. The intahpretah wa s their livin' God, when the Son of God was bein', givin ' his life fo' yo' an' ah. An' in this intahpretation it was [chants words] \"Eli, Eli , mah God, mah God, why has Thou fo' saken me?\" So ah feel like we should let a man know what thus says the Lord, an ' then yo' be free tuh serve God like yo' wan'a. If yo' don' believe in it, it still don' make the word of God is not right. HYATT Um hum. BISHOP WOMACK Ah believe in freedom of evahthin'. Ah don' believe in bein' a hypocrite, see? If, if the Holy Spirit would fall on yo', on him, on me, an' God was manifested, let that be God work. Evahbody no fool now, yo' know. Durin' the back [backwards] time, all nations undah heaven was theah an' the Holy Ghost fell on it an' begin tuh speak in uttahrance of tongues. An' den yo' take uh, Isaiah, the 28th chaptah an' 11th [lOth] verse. Well yo' know beg in­nin' from the fir s', it says, \"Line upon line an' precepts on precepts.

The former, after sounding out informant on his own, decided he and Cubby could handle the situation alone. After listening to a result quite worth-while, I saw no reason for another interview by me . Privately Mr . Cubby agreed. Only here and with preceding Doctor Walker were interviews ever taken by an assis tant .] CUBBY June 25, 1970. We are now at the home of Miss ____ Jones. We are in St. Petersburg, Florida. Thank you for remindin ' me Mr . Charles. Miss Jones is goin ' to tell us some personal experiences she had had in her lifetime . JONES Well this is one tha ' is very, very interestin' an ' very, very dif­flicult fo' me 'cause it had a very, very deep bearin ' on my life. I wus born here in St. Petersburg, Florida, January 17, 1924. My mothah an ' fathah are here right now. As I wus sayin ' I went to Detroit, Michigan in 1939. There I met this fam'ly, the Jordans. An ' I became involved with Hubert Jordan . An' his mothah, she didn ' like me atall [a'tall • at all] . An ' she says to me , \"Well, I don' 'preciate yo' foolin' wit my son 'cause yo' are not of my faith,\" says, \"'cause yore mo thah,\" says, \"she is a sanctified preachah an ' we don' be­lieve in holiness preachin' .\" An ' she said, \"We don' b'lieve in lady ministahs .\" So I says to her, \"Well it's not a mattah of what yo ' b'lieve in,\" I says, \"Hu­bert has ast me to marry 'im.\" She says, \"No , yo ' won' marry 'im.\" I says , \"I think I will. An ' jis' to show yo' tha ' I will I'm goin ' to tell 'im, yes.\" She says, \"Well it will be to yore sorrow.\" [Coughs.] So we got married 'cause I wus pregnant by 'im. Why it wus a rough ordeal. Naturally aftah we wus married we stayed in 'er house! Then the war came an' he went to service. So I said, \"Well, I'm pregnant an' I'm goin' to go home to my mothah an' fathah.\" She said , \"No , yo're not s'posed to go home, yo 're s'posed to stay wit me 'cause yo 're married to my son.\" I said , \"No, I 'm goin ' home.\" I says, \"My mo thah is goin' to come an ' git me .\" Which my mothah did . My mothah came an ' got me an ' I came here [home to St. Petersburg]. I birthed my daughtah wus three months ole I went back to Detroit so she could see 'er othah gran'­mothah. My mo thah said , \"Yes, go on.\""},{"pageNumber":981,"pageContent":"4740 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -An' when I went back up there I says, \"Well,\" I wrote an ' tole my dad tha ' I would git a job an' tha ' his [husband 's] mothah would take care of my daughtah. So I went to Gen ' ral Electric in Bridgeport, Connecticut to work . I wus workin' from 3 to 11 ev'ryday. I'd come home say about a quartah to 12 o'clock at night. I'm tired , res'-broken-I need to go to sleep. She [mother-in-law] say , \"No, here's yore baby yo ' have to take care of 'er.\" Well, naturally a li 'le baby -yore tired , they've got to sleep in bed wit yo ' - I jis' couldn' go fo ' it . So I says, \"I'm tired.\" I wrote [Hubert] an' tole him, \"I'm workin ' an ' I'm takin ' care of de baby.\" I said, \"Yore mothah, she is of no 'sistance to me,\" an ' I say, \"I'm workin' from 3 to 11, I git home 'bout a quartah to 12 o'clock, then Harriet 's [the baby ] gotta git in de bed wit me an ' I'm skeered I'll roll ovah [on her] or somethin', so I'm gon'a let my mamma have 'er.\" So he said , \"Tha's a good idea.\" [Presumably the mother-in-law and baby also went to Bridgeport,] So she [mother-in-law] said , \"No, yore mothah's not goin' to have Harriet.\" That' s my gran 'baby.\" I said , \"Well, I'll show yo ' what I'm gon'a do.\" I said, \"I'm gonna call my mothah, tell my mothah the situation an' I'll bet my mothah will come.\" She said, \"Well, yo 'll be sorry if she comes up here to git the baby. \" So I called my mothah an ' tole her the situation. I say, \"Mamma, I'm workin' awful hard an' I'm not able to work hard an ' take care of Harriet.\" An ' I come home no latah than 12 o'clock at night Harriet is gotta be in bed wit me. I'm tossin' tryin' no t to git on her.\" I said , \"Please come an ' git 'er.\" My mothah came . So she an' Mrs. Jordan got in a argumen'. Mrs. Jordan says, \"Well, yo' can't take my gran'baby.\" Mamma says, \"Well she's my gran' baby too, my daughtah birthed 'er.\" \"No, yo ' can't take 'er.\" My mothah says, \"I'm gon'a show yo' wha' I'm gon'a do.\" She says, \"Git dressed Mary, let's go .\" My mamma grabbed my daughtah, I packed my thin's. She says, \"Wait a minute,\" she said , \"no mattah wha' yo ' do, \" say, \"yo ' can take tha ' baby out of here but,\" said, \"Mary will nevah raise 'er.\" I say, \"One thin' I don' care if I don' raise 'er, yo ' won' raise her.\" My mamma says, \"Yo' sure won' , 'cause I'll raise 'er.\" So that 's jis' wha ' happened. An' then aftah my husban ' came from the war he said, \"Well?\" I said , \"No, it's no need fo ' nothin'.\" I said, \"Harriet is wit my mamma an ' she's happy an' she's goin ' to college an ' ev ' ry thin' so jis' call it quits .\" He said , \"Well, I'll give yo ' a divorce.\" I said, \"No, I'll jis' git a legal sep'ration .\" So tha ' how it ended. I wus out there- I wus livin ' in New York ag 'in.

I MEET CHARLES FOR THE FIRST TIME LATER WE LEARN LAST NAME WAS WILLIS LIVE FROGS IN HIS GRANDMOTHER'S LEG DISEASE CALLED \"FROGGED\" - RARE WORD OTHER RITES -LAST ONE COMPLICATED [Although this meeting occured 7 years ago in 1970 about June 15, I do not remember it at all, except one sunny afternoon Mr . Cubby and I stopped off a main highway among a few scattered pines and a water view. After our present conversation which shows Charles familiar with root work, I employ him as an assistant for Mr . Cubby.] HYATT I'm sitting here in Optimo Park in St. Petersburg. Mr . Cubby has left my companion and me [for about an hour]. We 're sitting here in the front of my car with the air conditioner on and we 're looking out at the palm trees and the water - that sort of thing . Now my companion is going to tell me a story that happened when he was a boy in Georgia, a story about him and his grandfather and spirits. CHARLES Oh this is aroun ' 1938 in Tipton, Georgia. Well mah fathah, mah gran'fathah wus known to see spirits. He always tole me he could see ghosts an' so forth . An ' he always kept a horseshoe nailed up on the do '. Ah ast him wha ' wus it fo '. He tole- said it wus fo' deterrent of the spirits, to ward off evil spirits. So one night the dahk caught us out in the fiel' as we wus comin' home. An ' he said , \"Wait, ah saw a ghost, a ghost pass 'cross the road.\" An ' hark! The mule stopped , raised his fron ' laig up an ' wouldn ' move. [Or was the mule 's name Hark?] So mah [grand]fathah whipped 'im, whipped 'im, an ' he still wouldn' move. So he got tired an ' waited a while. Aftah we waited fo ' about a halfa hour the mule walked on off . We got almos' to the house, ah'd say 'bout a third of a block , he said, \"Ah saw it ag'in!\" 'Bout tha ' time the mule stopped ag 'in. We only stopped 'bout 10 minutes, then he kep' goin ' maybe 10 or 12 paces an' he stopped ag ' in. Mah fathah , mah gran'fathah said he saw it ag 'in. So he got off .the wagon an' went into the house an' tole mah gran'mothah to give 'im some snuff. So aftah he chewed the snuff he spit in a can an ' then he got some grub­worms. Tha's a worm fo' the use of fishin' . [These latter were kept handy, not freshly dug.] An ' he put it in the snuff spit an ' put it undah the do 'step. Then he got back on the wagon an' this mule went on into the yahd. So he tole mah gran'mothah, says, \"He's aftah me . \" She says, \"Who's aftah yo'?\" [Grand­father says], \"Ah saw 'im ag 'in tonight .\" Mah gran'mothah tole 'im, she said , \"Yo ' know wha' to do 'bout tha' .\" He said , \"Ah know wha' to do.\" So the nex' day he got some crickets an ' he baked 'em in the oven , an ' he got some corn shucks an' dried 'em an ' sewed 'em in a bag, about 10 of 'em an ' hung 'em on a"},{"pageNumber":986,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -4745 big tree. An' a while latah he's on the same mule an' he saw the same ghost but the mule kep ' goin'. He said , \"Now he's 'fraid.\" An' aftah then, ah say 'bout a coupla days latah we saw it once mo ' an' we nevah saw it ag 'in. [Notice the simple and easily obtained materials. Old-time substances easily found and free!] HYATT Was this ghost s omeone that he thought personally was after him? Was it an impersonal ghost or was it somebody that didn't like him? Or just a ghost? CHARLES No, he thought it wus a guy he always had a gru'ge ag'ins'. They had a gru'ge ag' ins' each othah. An ' the guy got kilt -a mule kicked 'im in the haid. HYATT Oooh, I see. Was that the reason for the mule lifting up his leg, I wonder? [Did someone cause the mule to lift its leg? Was someone getting even?] CHARLES Yes, tha's wh ' ah think. The guy said before he died he'd come back from 'is grave an' git 'im. [Who? The grandfather or person causing the mule to kick? ] HYATT Uh huh. That was really somethin' ! How did the mule lift up his leg? Did he lift up one leg? CHARLES He lifted up 'is fron' paws firs ' an ' try to kick but he wus onto the wagon an' he jis' kicked 'is back laigs, not too high. He lift his fron' paws up as if to stomp . HYATT I see. Did your grandfather say that mules could see spirits? CHARLES He said mules could re'ly see spirits. He said all mules could. HYATT I see. Did he ever say anything about other animals seeing spirits? CHARLES He said a dog in a way can. He can smell, only way he can, smell a spirit. He know'd if one's roun' . He starts howlin'. One night a dog wus howl in ' in the night at mah gran ' pah ' s house. Ah say, \"Why's he howl in' ? [Grandfather says], \"'Cuz he sees a spirit.\" He say, \"Yo' go to the windahs an ' look.\" Ah say, \"Ah see.\" [I see = I understand, not I see the spirit the dog is barking at.] HYATT Could your grandfather normally see spirits? Did he have a gift of seeing them? CHARLES Yes, said he always did. HYATT Always [had ] seen spirits. CHARLES Tha' w hy he wus pahticlah watchin ' fo' de spirit, 'cuz de man prom­ised 'im from death tha' he would come back an' git 'im. HYATT Oh, I see. Now you heard that woman this morning tell us she had this oaZZ. Did you ever hear any stories about caZZs? I mean, people being gifted to see spirits or anything of this sort? [I am dwelling on this subj ect because spirits and hoodoo apparently run in families.] CHARLES No. Mah gran'fathah tole me he had a midwife when he wus bo'n. He said , uh the day he wus bo'n the midwife tol' 'is mothah, said , \"Your son will be mo ' gifted den the res ' of the kids .\" He wus about the fi'th son. [Is he trying to say seventh son? ] She say, \"Dis son gon'a be diff'run' .\" In fac' she wus the type tha ' could see spirits huhself. So she knew he wus diff' ren ' from all the res' she had delivahed. HYATT I see. CHARLES Becuz he said he stahted preachin' when he stahted talkin' good. Ah 'd say 'bout six yeahs ole. He wus diff'ren'. He ust to lay up in bed at night an ' cry when all the res' of the kids be 'sleep, 'cuz he could see spirits. HYATT Did you people live out in the country from Tipton, Georgia?

Mr. Cubby [he had done some preaching] who is going to tell me a story about a doctor who lived just about a hundred feet from where we are sitting [at Mr. Cubby's home in il­lustrat ion at end of volume 3] right here across the street. The house is no longer there. Now this is still Sunday, May 31, 1970 . Mr. Cubby here's the microphone. CUBBY Thank you Mr. Hyatt. The other day on Wednesday when I met Mr. Hyatt in front of the First National Bank, and immediately I recognized that he was a clergyman, and he asked me about taking him aroun ' town for about an hour. Upon gettin ' in the cab we began to talk about folklore an' he explained to me about his interest in folklore. I started to tell 'im about the story about a gentle­man who used to live not too far from me, about 100 yards from where I live, a Mr. Huey Dixon. Ev' ryone considered him a root doctor. He was a weird man in his own way. His home was built on a old-fashioned style, way back [from the street] an' it was complet ely surrounded by hedges and shrubbery. The house couldn ' be seen from the street. The kids in the neighborhood always called -it the haunted house. Mr. Dixon was a man who they say worked re' lly in roots an' craft' an ' stuff like that. The people in the neighborhood were re' lly afraid of 'im. There were rumors goin ' aroun ' that the women were payin' 'im to put roots out for their husban's who were playin' aroun ' with other women, gamblin' or doin ' whatever the women didn ' desire their husban's to do. There was also a sayin' that after Mr. Dixon was run outa town by some of the men in the neigh­borhood an' on a full-moon night you could see him standin' on the corner of 19th Street and Melrose Avenue South here in St. Petersburg. On some occasions I've had an opportunity as a kid to sneak into Mr. Dixon's yard, an' as any energetic boy would do, climb up to the window an' try to peek in. We noticed the windows had these very black and thick curtains and shades up to them an'"},{"pageNumber":995,"pageContent":"4754 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -you couldn't see very much at all. You couldn't even see past the window sill. However I am not sure that Mr. Dixon was a root doctor. But there has been on occasion that dogs and c ats and other animals have fallen over dead in his yard. He told us that he had cast a spell on them an' made them die. That's why I think everyone in the neighborhood was afraid of him. [Po ison did this trick. ] HYATT Good. CUBBY At this time that 's jus' about all I can tell you about Mr. Dixon be­cause he re' lly kep' to himself an' there wasn' very much you could learn about 'im. An ' everyone was afraid to visit him. I think he had no visitors at all. The home that he had has been torn down an' the city has put the property up for sale. No longer is ther e a trace of Mr . Dixon . HYATT Good. Good. Mr. Cubby is going to continue r ight now. All right there you are. CUBBY There's a old neighborhood rumor goin ' on aroun ' about a Miss Williams who lives at 1911 Melrose Avenue South. I knew Miss Williams ever since I was a kid. I grew up near her. She was a very weird person also. She kep' to her­self. She believed strongly in God. She always said that if anyone ever drink alcoholic beverages or anything of this sort they could never live in her house after she died . This house at 1911 Melrose Avenue South is still standin'. Miss Williams has been dead over 7 years. There has been numerous families who have tried to live there but none were able to live there because they were run out at night. I know for a fac' that doors are openin', lights have turned on without people turnin' the switch, because I lived right across the street at first', at 1910 Melrose. However, now my father resides there. There is one gentleman that I bel ieve could tell you better than I can bec ause he lived next door to her. No one out of the ••• I'd say 15 or 16 or 17 families maybe, have tried to live there­has been able to stay in that house over a period of 3 days. All the families that have moved there hav e either had to leave that same night or some stayed 2 days and 3 nights, the 3rd day they were gone. I believe that possibly there is a spirit in the house because I've seen even after I've grown up that the lights will come on at night, the doors will open . You can hear voices in the re. You can hear jus' as though someone was carryin' on church services in the house and there's no one in the house. The house is still standin' vacant. She has a brother who lives in the back of the house, in a little one room cot tage that he has. He has never been able to stay in the house, though the house was willed to him. He continues to fix it up as though someone lives there but there is no one that resides in the Williams house. This is the end of my story. HYATT Have you ever heard -you've told that ghost story -have you ever heard there is something you can do to run the ghost out of the house or protect your­self against the ghost or something of that sort? You know of anything like that? CUBBY I've heard once that you could burn some type of incense. An' the story that goes to get rid of the spirit of Miss Williams is that if this house is re­done that her spirit would go away. But her brother has tried repeatedly to re­model the house. He's never completed one thing he's done. As much as he's got­ten to do is paint the house, put in new windows. He's never been able to tear a single board from the house. HYATT They've never been able to tear a board off the house? CUBBY Not a single one. He say s that everytime he tries to tear a board away it seems as though it's the hardes' thing in the world to do. He's had on one occasion to slip from a ladder while tryin' to do something . He felt that she possible shook the ladder. This is his own belief. HYATT That's what he thinks. Well that's good, that's a good addition to the story."},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"atitu n! �t. iJrttrsburg. lJTlnribu \"The Sunehine City\" COUNCIL-MANAGER GOVERNMENT February 6th, 1039 '1' 0 '.JHOM IT !.�AY C o:·TC ERlJ: Tirl s will serve to introduce to you, DR .
