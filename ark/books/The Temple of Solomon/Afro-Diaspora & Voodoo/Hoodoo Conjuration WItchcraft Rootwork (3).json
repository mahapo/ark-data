Firs t, and immediately im­portant to understand anything at all, you will meet two persons en dlessly talk­in g, the author and one of his 1600 in for mants. He and they make this work per­haps the longest conversation ever prin ted, 3600 pages of text, not counting illustrations, and at least 400 pages more to follow in volume 5. To separate author from other talkers I now quote myself: These four volumes of HOODOO - CONJURATION - WITCHCRAFT - ROOTWORK, often abbreviated HOODOO [o1' \"hoodoo\"] when quoted [in the text], al'e one \"vast quotation fl'om my intel'views UJith hundreds of infomants\" in evel'Y southern state of the United States of Amel'ica except Texas. Let me e:r::p lain \"vast quotation.\" Omitting e:r::p lanato1>y notes within the b!'ackets, eve1>y UJol'd of the text is spoken by the autho1' 01' the pe1'son interoieUJed. \"To identify the t!Uo speakel's: all pal'entheses and bl'ackets enclose my Wol'ds; the fi1'st indicating question 01' comment dul'ing actual intel'Views, the second denot­ing subsequent editol'iaZ matter; eve1>ything else belongs to the infomants.\" (Hoodoo� vol.l, p.l, pa1'.2; the whole f1'om vol.3, p.1859, pal'.l.) You must consider these volumes an ar chive. They were not designed for read­in g seriat im, either cover to cover or volume after volume. For your guidance I have from the very beginn in g added mar gin titles , more elaborate ones while proceedin g, just in case an index could never be completed. As for their pur­pose, these volumes preserve original material hitherto little kn own an d col­lected, constantly changing , and much of it in older forms los t forever. What ty pe of thought am I trying to bring ab oveground where it can be studied and evaluated? Here we face a continuation of mental phenomen a centuries old, the syncretism of magic rites, pseudo-science an d relig ion. We could call it an underground gn osticism , remembering always that th e amount of syn cretism varied from place to place and time to time. Rites in these volumes wer e believed by both black and white people. The percentage of blacks and whites to total population as given by bl ack in formants will be found in the Introduction to volume 1, pages II-IV . That disjointed title HOODOO -CONJURATION - WITCHCRAFT -ROOTWORK is awkward indeed, yet each word expresses a special aspect of the whole, and all words occur frequently in the text. The word voodoo rarely appears . Hoodoo the word­according to elderly informants from Maryland through Florida - was either un­known to them or known as a fairly recent term for something they called witch­craft (often 'craft), conjuration (always cunjure), and rootwork (frequently roots). Later fr om published sources I learned that the word hoodoo surfaced in print about 1884. Whatever its origin , it mean s for me the eruption of modern commercialism in this field. Old-time doctol's, who used simple objects and materials at hand, were dying out about 1900 (see Zippy Tull, pp.923f., & p.5; also George Jackson , the high­man, p.912f.). After World War I, professional workers depended more and more upon the products of commerce, a vast variety of articles: candles of all colors and sizes, various shapes, to fill the needs of every desire; holy oil; in visible"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"II - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -ink; magic sand; special cloths and papers; powders which made cold water boiL (effervescent tablets); chemi cal substances when sprinkled on burning bewitched objects produced color lights; and even matches, soap and vinegar bought at a hoodoo drug sto�e were more powerful! How modern that last one sounds ! Ours is double st�ength! Watah me while I aomp� an unknown b�and with ou�s! Money baak if dissatisfied! Time again mus t be consulted to obtain a proper historical view of sit uations encountered during fieldwork. The material of these volumes was orally collected and recorded during the late 1930's and early 1940's, or before Martin Luther King' s march against Selma . Since my interviews were in homes and hotels of black people, a few problems could be ex pected. In those days as soon as an un kn own whit e man like me entered a black district , a stool pigeon or envious neighbor reported his presence to the police. That is why beginning with St. Petersburg, Florida, I always visited the Chiefs of Police before st art ing work in a new city. Even a letter from the Chief did not always protect me! In Wil­son, North Carolina, a white woman who could not get in to see me for a fortune­telling, notified the police. She could not believe that a white man was working in a black home and not taking money (see illustration Police! Police! Police! at end of vol.2). However, my greatest difficulty was the type of material I sought, not harmless superstitions like aounting ten or a�ossing finge�s, but something some informants called underwo�Zd wo�k or selling you�self to the deviL or witah­a�aft. Be assured that everything in these volumes has some relevance to the breadth and depth of witchcraft. Another aspect of time mus t be understood. There being no folklore course at the universities before or during my collecting days, I lacked both scientific training and guidance out in the fi eld. To pioneer is rarely an easy task. Sinc e volume 4 starts with an unfortunate break in the middle of section SHOES, not an interesting subject for a first meeting with HOODOO may I advise a new reader to look elsewhere, perhaps choosing A FEW MORE DOC�RS (pp.3185-3241) or Doato� Washington's offer (No .9024, pp. 3660-3663) to get me out of jail, if I ever became a bootlegger. Already having said so much about myself, I hesitate to add anything further to preceding Introductions and commen ts throughout the text. Yet one thing more may interest the reader, a personal experience about HOODOO I never exp ected dur­ing my lifetime. About November 1, 1974, I receiv ed a package mailed firs t-class but it lacked return address with name to show from where and whom it came. Appearance sug­gested some sort of publication and so it was. A well designed cover of warm grayish-green identified it as Revue de Louisiane II Louisiana Review; Vol.3, No.1, Summer 1974. Title page inside continued Revue semest�ieZle ••• po� le vJveZoppement du F�anaais en Louisiane .•• sous le Patronage des Unive�sit�s et CoLLeges de la Louisiane. Instead of the usual subscription blank between cover and title page, a slip of paper directed me to see page 29. To my surprise I saw a �eview �tiaZe, a featured criticism of 9 pages. Not since Julian Huxley 's famous introduction of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to the world - on the front and following pages of the London Times Lite�a� Supplement years ag o -did any re­vi ew interest me more. Its title displayed my name! HYATT'S HOODOO ODYSSEY. The word \"odyssey\" symbolized for me the ancient Greek spirit in search of self-fulfillment, a journey wor th-whi le regardless of hazards . My critic 's title and discuss ion revealed that he had spent a considerable amount of time upon these volumes and had thought deeply about the man behind them. With in­si ght and scholarship he mentioned good things as well as weaknesses , the former outweighing the latter . Therein once again the word \"odyssey\" had been well"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -III chosen.

I have no desire some day to become a horrible legend known as Hoodoo Hyatt or as the father of The Eighth Book of Moses. If this sounds like nonsense, believe it or not, some of the rites in HOODOO are already being attempted! . As a final word about \"Odyssey,\" I am offerin g the reader a condensed quota­tion from the first page of this remarkable criticism written by Fr ancis A. deCaro of Lou isiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

MURDER [Until 1936, the year following the publication of my first edition of Fo lkZoPe from Adams County Illinois (2nd ed., 1965), I neither·knew nor suspect­ed there was a folklore about murder. In the first edition of FACI -abbrevia­tion used in present Hoodoo for preceding book - the act of murder occurs 8 times: (1) in a dream, No.6305; (2) omen of future murder from wedding dress, 7268; (3) site of murder an unlucky place for playing cards, 8931; (4) a black informant had heard about bringing back murderer by writing a letter, but could not explain how it was done, 9176; (5) dropping umbrella on floor a sign of fu­ture murder in that house, 10174; (6) murderer revisits scene of crime , 10279; (7) murderer unable to sleep facing the east, the sun [Son] , 10280; and (8) if you talk about murder every day for 6 months [a folkway of saying if murder be­comes an obsession] , you'll be hanged for murder, 10650. The Index in FACI (1st ed. ) under Murder also says : see bloodstain, hoodoo and witchcraft, spirits. I will divide MURDER into 2 parts: HOW MURDERER CAN ESCAPE, and HOW MURDERER CAN BE CAUGHT. This separation of course can not be absolute, because some inform­ants will give both escape and caught aspects of murder in the same statement. The final aspect of MURDER, the TRIAL, is reserved for COURT CASES later. (1) . HOW MURDERER CAN ESCAPE [Obviously a murderer will use any method he has ever heard of to escape cap­ture by the law. If he has time and knows about one, he may stop at the house of a wise woman or witchcPafteP or hoodoo for aid, but usually such professional assistance is not called in until the trial. Some doctoPs , especially the cele­brated DoctoP Buzzard (p .891) , specialized in all types of criminal work. Here, however, follow a few of the magic devices supposed �o help a murderer in flight.] 7261. If a man is kilt dere's two certain ways. If a man is kilt an ' he falls on his back, dat 's de man , dat's de murderer kin easily escape an' very seldom captured. But if a man's kilt an' MURDER VICTIM FALLS ON FACE OR BACK fall on his face, de murd erer of de man is easily captured. But jis' how it's done, ah don't know, ah nevah have heard jis' how it's done . [St. Petersburg, Fla . , (996), 1612:3.] 7262.

HOW MURDERER CAN BE CAUGHT [Rites for catching a murderer are much more varied and interesting than those permitting him to escape, egg rites alone being amazing both in number and diver­sity . Everywhere the spirit of the murdered person is present or its presence assumed.] 7354. Jes' lak a man kill a man or woman -if he kill a woman.

Dey said [say for instance] dat ah'd kill yo ' an ' so anybody didn't know who done it, dey go an ' lay dere han' on 'im an ' de blood would come from 'im. (They could tell that you'd killed him?) Yes. [Fayetteville, N. Car. , (1397) , 2515:19.] 7358. Ah've heard dat if a person has got killed an' de person who killed 'im, if he happen tuh be dere- be roun' dere.

[The word to purge is commonly used to describe the bleeding of a corpse when touched by the murderer. Since the word to purge frequently means to cause evac­uation of the bowels or to clean or empty the bowels , was there a confusion be­tween bleeding and purging by the corpse? We must remember that formerly, espec­ially in hot weather, a body was buried within 24 hours. Even then purging must have been frequent.

(They'll know that you killed him then.) Yes sir. [St. Petersburg, Fla. , (1024) , 1657:7.] 7365. I have heard my grandmother say, that if a person has been murdered, that one way to find out the murderer is to allow a number of people to pass one by one and let each one put his hand_on the murdered person . When touched by the guilty one the corpse will begin to bleed at that place. It is said that many murderers have been detected in that way. [By my contact man , Jerry Williams, by Ediphone at Ocean City, Md . , in summer of 1936.] 7366. When murderer enters room, corpse CORPSE BLEEDS IF MURDERER ENTERS ROOM begins to bleed.

[I am adding a number merely to CROSS OF STRAW TO CAUSE CORPSE TO BLEED call attention to several unusual rites that could have been included here: (1) Break a straw into two pieces and cross them on the forehead of the murdered man.

Den after that, well , d ay drug 'im out on the railroad [to suggest death by accident] . [Snow Hill, Md. , (?) , 14:6. ] 7370. I have heard that, if a person is murdered in a house and there is a bloodstain on the floor, it remains there unless you take that piece of wood out. [New York City , by Ediphone, informant No.3, probably from Virginia.] 7371. There has always been a saying that where a person is murdered or killed that any of the blood has been spilled, you can always tell because it will show itself afresh whenever it's cloudy weather or raining. The stain will become inevitable in the floor, if it' s on a board, and it can't be prevented. You can scrub it but it will always come during stormy rainy weather. [New York City, by Ediphone , informant No .lO, from near Orangeburg, S. Car.] 7372. (If they found a person that got killed, had been murdered?) Yes, [they] say de stain would be on whosomevah did de crime , de stain would nevah leave him-some part of 'im.

[If the purpose and details of the forego ing rite appear hazy, blame my scanty experience with hoodoo up to this time . The proper questions and explanatory notes for the recording cylinder would improve with more time. As I res tudy this rite, a few after thoughts arise : (1) Is informant talking about blaak aorn-peas, as recorded, or does he say or intend to say blaak aowpeas? Surely one of our several cowpea rites confronts us. The cowpea (Vigna sinensis) I have already discussed somewhere in Hoodoo. Somet imes called black-eyed pea , black-eyed bean, etc., it is or was an extensive forage and green manure crop of the Southern States in the U.S .A. The seeds are or were often used for food. (2) Since the cowpea plant is more nearly related to the bean , we have here a historical con­nection with ancient death beliefs. (3) Notice that our peas or b eans are not planted in or thrown into an actual grave, but in a mock grave between two rows of growing corn , i.e.maize. Here we have a reason for calling them coPnpeas, if this latter word was meant. Our informant digs a small oblong hole, at the bot­tom of which he makes 6 small square holes, one for each pea. At first I thought we had an example of Chinese-box plant ing, square hole within square hole sort of thing; but informant corrects me with 6 separate holes, each separately covered with a small piece of wood - each of the latter a coffin symbol. Did this orig­inally bring back the murderer on the seventh day? At least we are told: When dem peas spPout� de aorn will be gone. Presumably only the ears of (sweet?) corn are gone, which permits the peas or beans to climb up the denuded cornstalks -hence the aornpeas. (4) The purpose of the rite is not given.

This means the graveyard-dirt sprinkler goes completely round the house. Here we have a rite of circumambulation, also a circle of graveyard dirt about the house. As soon as the dweller within passes over the graveyard dirt , he �11 be driven permanently from house and perhaps town. But the sprinkler himself has trouble. He is inside the graveyard-dirt circle! If he walks out of the circle, crossing the dirt, he breaks his spell against the dweller; moreover, the spell automatically tuPns back upon the sprinkler, who now will be chased by the spirit! Our sprinkler solves his problem with a magic rite I have never recorded or met before. He proceeds neither forwards nor backwards; he sidles sideways. If sprinkler moves forwards or backwards across the dirt , at some point of each step his legs and feet pass and are at the moment of passing in a straight line. In an instant the spirit pounces upon him! But if sprinkler slides his right foot sideways to the right , then his left foot sideways to the right, not letting left foot touch right, then legs and feet are never in a straight line. He always presents to the waiting spirit only one half of his body at each step . The spirit is tricked! Why does sprinkler on reaching home sprinkle some of the same graveyard dirt at his own door?

Though my informant does not say so, the pan of salt holding names and burn­ing candles did not res t on the floor, but upon an altar. We mus t also suspect the presence of holy obj ects, such as pictures of saints. My great friend , the Rev. J. Langtry Williams - mentioned in Piatures for Alma at the end of Folklozoe fz>om Adams County Illinois, 2nd edition - described the reli­gious arrangement of his part-time housekeeper. She being elderly and ill, he went up to Harlem (black section in New York City) on a pastoral call. Her whole room was an altar! Two wires from the four corners of the ceiling sagged and crossed in the center of the room. Along these wires at intervals were strung holy pictures and obj ects. In one of the corners was a shelf or small stand hold­ing a colored light with a float. She had seen my friend 's sanctuary lamp over in the church , but these private shrines were common long before she met Father Wil­liams . All these religious actions are concerned with what I call the magia of the diagonal, one arm or both of the \"X\" or St. Andrew's cross.

The same word is used for a woman's action, both in hoodoo and non-hoodoo thought, according to a question commonly asked of a woman: Did you come? A more generalized term denoting sexuality for both men and women appears in the word nature, found frequently in Hoodoo. Our present rite speaks of a fluid coming from the woman and making a spot, as her nature. This nature of hers is bottled with a chicken egg: Dat keeps yore [maZe ] fri en 's away from 'er an ' keeps yore wife at home.
