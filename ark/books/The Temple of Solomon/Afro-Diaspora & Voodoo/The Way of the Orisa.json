Perhaps older than speech, these thoughts coalesced intomythology when language evolved. The mythologies of peoples theworld over attempted not only to answer these questions but to laydown the general \"truths\" of the creation of the earth and the specificnatural forces involved and, in a very human way, to anthropomor-phize these forces, to make them into understandable human formswith human traits.TMany types of religion evolved in Africa, nurtured by the wise menand women of that continent. Some of these institutionalized beliefswere simple and uncomplicated, developed by hunters and gathererswho were concerned only peripherally with a far-off creator god but in-timately involved with a few immediate deities who controlled thewinds and rains and brought game and a well-gathered harvest . . . orwithheld them through natural disasters. In some African societies,like that of the Yoruba, people became sedentary horticulturists, devel-oping a trade surplus and classes of specialists such as weavers, pot-ters, blacksmiths, or metal casters. Out of economic surplus grew ahierarchical society, whose pattern was reflected in the complex reli-gion of Ifa and the pantheon of gods of heaven and earth that Ifabrought into being. Over hundreds of years of development the Yorubareligion mirrored the increasing complexity of the Yoruba society. ManyIX"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"wise old men became priests of deities that had once representednatural forces of either the sky or earth and had many traits commonto humans. In more modern times these deities came to embody thecharacteristics of living rulers and culture-heroes; for example, Sango,god of thunder, was once a real-life Alafin of Oyo, the secular king ofall Yoruba.These Yoruba of what is present-day Nigeria in West Africa not onlyrecognized a very large pantheon of gods, supervised by Oludumare,the creator, but developed a highly complex yet flexible system of div-ination called Ifa, named after the deity who controls it. This system,evolving with typical Yoruba thoroughness and complexity to embraceany contingency, is a marvelous mix of human inventiveness and di-vine directive. Its very flexibility is extraordinary. It is nonjudgmentalin character, therefore avoiding the traps of ethical religious systems,which produce guilt. It is a system that leaves ethical questions andconcerns to the secular realm.But much more important than a description of a religion or ananalysis of its iconography, if such exists, is the question of what func-tion that religion plays in society. Certainly that is true of the Yorubareligion and Ifa divination as it has survived successfully for at least1,350 years. Its ability to survive seems to lie in its flexibility and itsadaptability to new circumstances. Most important, however, Ifa pro-vides a pragmatic and psychological cushion against the vicissitudesof life. To the early Yoruba people there was the ever present threat ofdroughts, floods, winds, baking sun, and insects, and the unseen ene-mies of bacteria and viruses that carried off at least three children outof every five born. Next was the terror of the Middle Passage, when somany Yoruba were sold into slavery by neighboring Yoruba kings dur-ing the internecine warfare of the late eighteenth and the nineteenthcenturies.Those who survived to reach the New World represented all special-ties: priests, kings, warriors, women who were heads of huge markets,sculptors, weavers, house builders, and potters, to name but a few.Herded onto stinking ships under unspeakably horrible conditions,these Africans took with them a formidable cultural baggage of skillsXFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"and knowledge invisible to their European captors, and a religion thatwould function to help them survive the trials and rigors of their newlife.Those Yoruba arriving in Spanish and Portuguese settlements inthe New World soon found that they were forced to choose between ac-cepting the Catholic faith or receiving crueler punishments. Sensibly,they accepted this new religion that they did not understand. Thosewise babalawos (priests of Ifa) who survived the Middle Passage andthe early days of slavery must have soon realized that it would be nec-essary to train apprentices in order to pass on the Yoruba religion andensure the survival of both humans and gods. Their rationale for thesurvival of deities that otherwise could not cross water was that themost important spirit was Ori, the head, or rather that which was in-side the head, and from that all others would come. Divination trav-eled intact as well.Myths drift and change with the imaginations of the people re-counting them. But increasingly in the New World, interpretation ofthe Yoruba religion and its rituals, as well as those of Ifa, becamealmost codified in a way not at all typical of Africa, where a variety oflocal interpretations are found to this day. Ifa divination survivedfairly intact because, uncannily, it worked. Its efficacy was not just inthe appropriateness of its verse but in the accumulated power of thespoken word.This power is a phenomenon shared by a wide range of African tra-ditions, and it has survived among peoples in the New World diaspora.Part of both the religious and the secular cultures, it is a belief thatthe spoken word has a power of its own, a belief that words can bespiritually potent and be protective medicine, too. Even in the secularrealm of political institutions, well-spoken words can possess a kind ofpower over the minds of others. The praise songs voiced for deities notonly make the orisa (or deities) happy, but the momentum of verseafter verse takes on a power of its own. (It is an interesting footnotethat in the New World, though the drum calls to gods are recognized,the original tonal Yoruba language, which can be plainly understoodby onlookers as calls or praise songs, is not used.) The drumming thatFOREWORDXI"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"accompanies the singing of songs reinforces the power of words. Smallwonder then that the power attributed to the babalawo, and therespect accorded him, comes not only from his ability to divine themessages and interpret them with the help of Orunmila (god of knowl-edge) through Ifa, but from his absorbing and remembering somethree thousand verses associated with the various throws of the divin-ing chain.At the heart of this Yoruba religion is the concept of ase, an individ-ual's personal spiritual power, which grows throughout life through aperson's diligent application to doing good deeds, coupled with appro-priate and calm behavior and with service to the gods in the form ofsacrifice. The reciprocity of service between gods and humans is essen-tially the giving of strength, the renewal of ase to the orisa throughblood sacrifice of animals designated as belonging to a specific deity.Renewed and grateful deities in turn bless their supportive wor-shipers with added ase. The rules of this loving support between hu-mans and gods are all known to that father-of-all-knowledge, thebabalawo.Within the past few years, the Religion (as it is known to its devotedfollowers) has undergone a phenomenal surge in popularity and ametamorphosis in the United States. Santeria, the syncretism of theoriginal Yoruba religion and Ifa with Catholicism, came into theUnited States first with Puerto Ricans in the forties and fifties andthen with the flood of Cuban refugees in the sixties. Haitian refugeesthen brought Vodun, a mixture of Yoruba, Fon, and Hueda deities withKongo gods and magic. Many practitioners of both Vodun and Sante-ria are now seeking the basic Yoruba religion as their priestly leadersunwind and detach the Catholic saints from the orisa. Those AfricanAmericans who reject this syncretism as a compromise to a slave reli-gion look to Oyotunji Village near Beaufort, South Carolina, whereYoruba culture and religion is still practiced. Though some observershail this rejection of syncretism as a rallying point for black national-ism, it seems that those who go to Oyotunji Village to study Yoruba re-ligion (and its practice has now spread to other parts of the UnitedStates as well), are searching to reclaim the religion of strength, innerpeace, and power that came out of Africa with their ancestors.XIIFOREWORD"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Another growing group of Ifa practitioners, of which the author ofthis volume is a leader, encompasses members of every race and cul-tural background, just as the Yoruba of Africa would have it.

Many Americans, disenchantedwith Judeo-Christian religion, are seeking a religion of personal ful-fillment, one that gives them a sense of personal worth and power overtheir own destinies. They are discovering that Ifa allows them to keeptheir material accomplishments while giving them a sense of spiritualrelease and proclaims that, if they unfetter themselves from strictlylinear thinking, all things are possible.Philip Neimark feels that Americans today are as spiritually adriftas the Africans were culturally adrift when they were brought tothe shores of the New World.

I have come to seethat my fears—all fears—are burdensome and unnecessary.II believe that fear is the primary motivating force in our culture.When I look back over my own life I see that my drive to accomplishstemmed more from a fear of what others might think of me if I didn'tachieve than from any joy I might derive from using my inherent ca-pabilities. I also believe that I was driven by a fear of death. If I awokeat 2:00 A.M. after downing a pizza at midnight, I was sure that I washaving a heart attack rather than indigestion. If my sinuses gave me aheadache, I was sure that I had a brain tumor. If I had to fly on an air-plane, I worried that it would crash.My fears were based on two faulty premises. The first was that lifecould be lived according to other people's standards, which is absurd.The second was that, in order to survive, I had to be in total control,1"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"which is impossible. Together, these premises provided me with morepain than pleasure.I had been trained in an either-or notion of reality in which (or so Ithought) I could choose to be material or spiritual but not both. But Ididn't want to relinquish my worldly acquisitions or abandon my pur-suits in the material world in order to have a rewarding spiritual life. . . and I didn't think I should have to.Then, in 1974, I \"discovered\" Ifa, a thousands-of-years-old Africanreligion that took root in the sophisticated city-state culture of theYoruba kingdom in what is now Nigeria. It is the oldest monotheisticreligion on earth. Ifa contains an either-or premise: in Ifa, either welearn to integrate the spiritual and the material or we can never behappy and fulfilled. Ifa does not require that we abandon our materialpursuits or the pleasure and pride we take from them; in fact, it extolsthem. Ifa does not draw a battle line through the midbrain, pittinglogic against intuition, our bodies against our souls. I think it is pre-cisely this dichotomy, this separation of mind and spirit, that causesso much of the burnout we see in people today.I discovered Ifa because of a whim one Sunday afternoon. My wifeand I had joined some friends who were going to get a reading from ababalawo (priest). I didn't have the slightest idea what a babalawowas, and, philosophically, I was opposed to any kind of \"nonsensicalmysticism.\" All things considered, the last place you would have ex-pected to find me on a Sunday afternoon in sunny Miami would behaving my fortune told.Yet \"there are no accidents,\" as I have pointed out to hundreds uponhundreds of individuals who consult with me. So, on a steamy sum-mer Sunday afternoon in Miami, Florida, I found myself being ush-ered into a room where three men dressed in robes and wearingstrange hats were sitting cross-legged on straw mats. At the time I didnot realize that this was not an everyday divination session with thelocal babalawo. It was divination to ascertain my personal guardianorisa and would include my first \"life reading.\" After reciting a streamof prayers in Yoruba, the oldest babalawo began to cast the ikin (sa-cred palm nuts). He did this by passing sixteen nuts from hand tohand. If, after grabbing as many as his hand would hold, there wasone nut left, he would inscribe the figure \"II\" in the powder on his di-1INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"vining tray. If two nuts were left, he would mark the figure \"I.\" If noneor three or more were left, no figure was written. After eight markshad been inscribed, my odu, or sign, could be interpreted.The sum and substance of my initial reading was contained in themythology of my sign. The story, briefly translated, tells of a youngand successful ruler who was dethroned through betrayal and trick-ery. Not only did he lose his title; he lost his wealth, his wife, and hisfamily and was cast out of his country into the wilderness. Here theyoung man tried to survive alone. He became weaker and weaker ashe tried to battle the elements without shelter or tools.In a neighboring kingdom, much larger and more prosperous thanthe one from which the young king had been exiled, an aged king hadpassed away. The babalawos, in casting for a new oba (king), hadrelated to the people of the kingdom that Orunmila (orisa of knowl-edge) had foretold that the new oba would be found alone and nakedwhere a plume of smoke appeared.Back in the wilderness the young man sat shivering and alone. Hehad given up all hope of ever returning to his kingdom, and he wasfast losing his confidence in his ability to survive long enough to reacha neighboring land. Finally, with great sadness, the young man re-moved the last vestiges of his former greatness, his royal robes. Plac-ing them in a pile, he set fire to them and huddled close to the flamefor the warmth he so desperately needed.The babalawos from the neighboring kingdom looked out into thejungle and saw a single plume of black smoke rising skyward. Theyrushed toward the site, and there, as Orunmila had foretold, was ayoung naked man. The prophecy had come to pass. The young manwas made oba of the new kingdom, and his greatness, his wealth, hiswives, and his family were more abundant than ever.In interpreting this for me, the babalawo concluded the following:First, I would probably lose much of what I had achieved up to thatpoint. Second, if I sacrificed and followed Orunmila, I would becomegreater than ever before. Third, to ultimately realize the full potentialof my path, it was imperative that I become a babalawo! Indeed, Iwould lose all I had acquired so that I could search out my correctpath.

I remember my frustration at not being able to get a \"rational\"explanation for what had happened and finally blurted out, \"Dr. Bas-com, you sound as if you believe in it!\" His response, which was tochange my life, was simply \"Mr. Neimark, all I can tell you is, itworks.\"Opon, or diviner's tray, with tapper.4INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Cartesian worldview has shaped every aspect of our lives, holdingthat all things can be broken down into parts (the body is a group ofatoms, for example), which thereby enables us to believe that we canmaster each component and, subsequently, the whole. This worldviewhas set up a world of either-ors—the dualism that has created such adangerous imbalance in our lives and the life of the planet.In Ifa, it is understood that, as with logic and intuition, the rationaland nonrational, linear and nonlinear were given to us to use and touse together. To Ifa, the singular excesses of materialism are as unin-telligent as the singular excesses of spirituality. To use only one half ofyour capacity—either half—is to play at life with half a deck.From its inception, Ifa has been based on an undeniable pragma-tism. We believe in results. Through its ancient rituals and prayers, Ifashows us that it is not only permissible but imperative that we use ourspiritual capacities to favorably influence our everyday lives. And whynot? Ifa recognizes the universal need for secure and fulfilling lives andgives us rules and rituals for tapping into the great pool of unquench-able energy to solve our problems and make practical improvements.We do this through ancestor worship, divination, and the orisa.One of the central beliefs of Ifa is that only two events in our livesare predetermined: the day we are born and the day we are supposedto die.

Just as our universi-ties teach us how to access and be comfortable with the logicalcapacities of our brains, formal religion should be the Universityof the Spirit. In the same way that we learn how to balance our check-books, run a computer, or repair a car by using the logical hemisphereof the brain, religion should teach us how to use the intuitive hemi-sphere to access the energy and power that exist only in the nonlinearworld. To reach transcendence—that simple but exquisite act of feel-ing, unencumbered by any linear thought—is the key. Ifa is one of theoldest universities of the spirit and has for thousands of years taughthow to effectively access the energy of transcendence and use it withlogical behavior in a productive fashion.IThe philosophy of Ifa originated with the Yoruba peoples of WestAfrica in what is now Nigeria. Ifa mythology relates that the creationof humankind arose in the sacred city of He Ife just outside what is nowLagos. The Yoruba created a highly sophisticated city-state empire,which, according to many anthropologists, was on a par with that ofancient Athens. Their philosophy reflected an integration of the basictruths and wisdom of nature with the equally true, but vastly different,demands of a sophisticated commercial culture. Ifa was not a productof superstition, ignorance, or lack of education but of years of practiceand refinement by successful, intelligent, and highly educated men andwomen who used it for the simplest of reasons: it worked!Indeed, my original fascination with Ifa was based, in large mea-sure, on trying to understand how this philosophy could have survivedfor thousands of years if it had to provide practical, everyday resultsfor its followers. You either cure the illness or you don't. You either getthe job or you don't. You either win the dispute or you don't. These arenot the kind of results that can be hedged or put off \"until you areready\" or until your next life.And then I saw the barren have children, business disaster turn tosuccess, and \"incurable\" illnesses cured through divination and sacri-fice. I have come to believe that Oludumare (God) understands thatbelief is easier to acquire when there are practical results. So he notonly provides his followers with the instructions for improving theirAN OVERVIEW15"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"lives, he intends for them to substantiate their faith through practical,everyday results.The basic foundation of Ifa is three-pronged: orisa worship, ances-tor worship, and divination.THE ORISAThe orisa are energy that, for the most part, represent aspects of na-ture. Osun (pronounced O-SHUN) represents sweet waters, love,money, conception; Sango (pronounced Zhan-GO) represents thunderand lightning, strategy, and he is the warrior; Esu (pronouncedA-shew), messenger to Oludumare (the single God), owner of roads andopportunities, owner of ase (spiritual energy); Yemonja/Olukun (pro-nounced Yeh-MO-zha/O-lu-KUN), the ocean, mother, provider of wealth;Obatala (pronounced O-BA-ta-la), the head, clarity, arbiter of justice;Oya (pronounced Oi-YA!), marketplace, tornadoes, change of fortune,she is the female warrior; Ogun, owner of all metals, fierce warrior,honor, and integrity.As parts of one intricate universal body, we all contain minute por-tions of the energies from all its other parts. In the worldview of Ifa, inaddition to being primarily human, we are also the rock, the lion, thetree, the ocean. Through the worship of orisa, we can each take ourown small quantity of the other types of energy and loop it to its con-comitant energies in nature. For example, a woman unable to conceivea child would most likely find it necessary to tap into the energy ofOsun, orisa of sweet water, love, money, and conception. Someone suf-fering from a troubled head, or too much pressure from work, wouldfind it productive to tap into the energy of Obatala, orisa of the head,justice, coolness, and clear thinking. By calling upon the orisa, we areable to geometrically increase our power to change or improve specificsituations in our lives.Ifa also teaches that each of us has a single orisa energy from theuniverse that is predominant within us. We call this our guardianorisa. Learning to be comfortable with its characteristics and to tapinto them in a meaningful way is an important step toward success-14THE WAY OF IFA"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"fully traveling our paths. In Part Two, I will guide you to identificationof your own guardian orisa.ANCESTOR WORSHIPAncestor worship is a formalized structure for connecting with the ac-cumulated knowledge, wisdom, and power of our dead blood relatives.Ifa understands that energy—the essence of us all—cannot be createdor destroyed. The energy and wisdom of our deceased blood relatives isuniquely connected with and available to us. It is not simply RNA orDNA that links us to our past; it is a road of energy and power that isavailable to those of us who know and practice the rituals.DIVINATIONIn Ifa, we believe that our destinies or life patterns are establishedprior to our births into this world, and that through information ob-tained through divination, it is possible to know something about ourfutures and the outcomes of all of our undertakings. We believe thatwe can improve upon these life patterns with proper offerings and de-votions.Ifa teaches that, with the exception of the day you are born and theday you are supposed to die, there is no single event that cannot beforecast and, when necessary, changed. Anything less would implypredestination, which is antithetical to the Ifa concept that we \"crownour own heads.\"Unlike other paradigms such as astrology, I Ching, or tarot, Ifadivination tells us what is likely to happen if we do nothing to changeour circumstance. Not only does it forecast the future, it offers an op-portunity to change it! By identifying a potential problem or potentialgood fortune, the babalawo can pinpoint the energy source necessaryto alter or enhance it as well as provide the client with a specific rit-ual for accessing the energy (orisa) that will help accomplish thetask.AN OVERVIEW15"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The first, and most important, method of divination is that per-formed through the use of ikin, a kind of palm nut that is thrown to ob-tain a series of eight binary symbols. These symbols, called odus, canalmost be considered chapter headings in the sacred book of Ifa divina-tion. Each odu refers to specific tales that have been passed on fromone babalawo to another for thousands of years in an oral tradition.The babalawo will ascertain the specific odus that represent aclient's current situation through a reading of the eight binary num-bers. This initial reading will reveal which primary odu is operativefor the client at that moment. Then, through a series of alternativecasts, he can select the particular story that is most pertinent to theclient's needs. Skilled babalawos understand that the genuine or coreissue affecting a client is often not the problem for which the clientsought help. For example, a man may come to the babalawo becausebusiness is bad and he is feeling financial strain. His reading, how-ever, might indicate that his problems are with his family and that itis that stress that is creating disruption to his energy flow, therebycausing him to neglect or do an inadequate job at work. The knowl-edgeable babalawo can see the root problem and suggest ways to cor-rect it. The secondary problems will then resolve themselves.It is important to differentiate between the odu's call for sacrifices,or ebos, in order to alleviate specific problems or conditions and theoverview of the odu itself. In one sense the problems, potential dangers,or good fortune indicated during divination represent the potholes orunexpected rewards on a person's path. Although the roadblocks mustbe removed, what the client really needs is to see his or her true life'spath.

She was both academically and personally interested innontraditional forms of divination. Her personal \"project\" was a bookon astrology from an academician's viewpoint. She was immediatelyattracted to the beauty and power of Ifa and within just a few shortmonths had received her warriors (Esu, Ososi, Ogun, and Osun) andhad undergone several other small initiation rites. Time and againshe marveled at the connection she felt and the power Ifa offered. Shewas so enamored of what she felt that she told me she wished to be-come a priestess of Yemonja/Olukun, her guardian orisa.During this period she came for divination frequently. With a singleexception she followed all the prescribed sacrifices and offerings. Theone exception was that she would not offer prayers and food to thespirit of her dead father.

Afolabi is also a fifth-generationbabalawo whose grandfather was perhaps the most famous babalawoin written history. The first time we discussed ancestor worship, Afo-labi simply told me the following story:I was in the midst of preparing a paper on some of the histories thatcomprise the sacred odu, when I suddenly could not remember one par-ticular story. The paper was due in just three days. In your country youmight pick up the phone and call someone to find the information, but intruth, these facts were known only by my father, who lived in Lagos, andmy deceased grandfather. At that time Nigeria still did not have phonesin many individual homes, so contacting my father prior to presentationof my paper would be impossible. Unless I restructured my entire lectureI would have to find the missing history. So, I \"called\" my grandfather inour way. I used our ritual of ancestor worship to convey to him that Ineeded his help. The next night, I awakened from a sound sleep to seemy grandfather sitting on the edge of my bed. \"What is the problemFalo?\" he asked. I explained my situation, and he instructed me to get apencil and paper that I keep near my nightstand. He proceeded to giveme the information I had forgotten.

People of Eastern cultures such as the Chinese, Koreans, Indians,Japanese, and Tibetans, along with great segments of the populationsof South America, Mexico, Cuba, Bali, Indonesia, Polynesia, Mongolia,the Eastern Baltics, Iceland, and New Guinea offer respect to andseek guidance from their ancestors. Yet because most of us in theWestern world were raised in the Jewish and Christian traditions,which proscribe ancestor worship, Western newcomers to Ifa tend tobe skeptical of it. Ancestor worship fits perfectly into the Ifa devotee'sintegrated view of the physical and spiritual worlds.You would imagine that everyone would be thrilled to have \"proof,\"or a way to authenticate knowledge, of an afterlife. If you were to askone hundred \"average\" Americans if they believe in life after death,one or two might say yes. Five or ten will say absolutely not. But aboutninety percent will tell you, \"Well, I'd like to, but I really don't know.\"Yet when Ifa offers them a way to \"know,\" they still resist.Let me explain what I mean by knowledge. Knowledge is what youreally know in your heart or in your gut. It's not always logical, but itis totally real and true. A mother, for example, \"knows\" that she lovesher child. If someone or something starts to hurt that child, she willinstantly, automatically, and without \"thinking\" do anything in herpower to protect it. Even if the child misbehaves, or grows up and ig-nores her, that love will not waver. Knowledge comes from feeling andexperience. It is not quantifiable. You know when you love anotherperson; you know when you are moved by a book, music, or a sunset;you know when you feel peaceful—not because someone has listed allthe good characteristics of the person you love or explained the sen-tence structure in the book, the mathematical precision of the music,or the light waves of the sunset, but because you experience it, youfeel it. Logic has nothing to do with it. In fact, the truth of knowing24THE WAY OF IFA"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"something is much more powerful, accurate, and trustworthy than thelinear processes of \"learning\" or \"understanding.\"Ancestor worship will provide you with the knowledge that life is acontinuum by enabling you to actually communicate with the energyof your departed family members and feel the profound feelings thatthat engenders. This may not happen in a familiar form—you may notfind your grandfather sitting on the edge of your bed—but it willnonetheless be real and true. Not a product of wish fulfillment or hys-teria, it will come through as irrefutable knowledge of the nonlinearside of reality.Why are we so afraid of this knowledge? The answer, I believe, isthat when we actually experience this access to other worlds, we areforced to question the very foundations and premises upon which wehave built our lives—questions that invite change. And humans arenaturally resistant to change.Try to imagine the kinds of decisions you would make if you knewyou would have future lives. Think about the number of short-termchoices you make now. After all, if you believe that this is your onlytime around, then it makes sense to cram it with gratification and sen-sation. Growth and development would seem less important thanacquisition and indulgence. The national debt, environmental destruc-tion, pollution, the elimination of plant and animal species, fast cars,and fast food—all are products of our culture's fixation on the now. Butif you knew this wasn't your only time around, you would be far lesslikely to cut down the rain forest, use nonrenewable resources, or poi-son the rivers and oceans with lethal waste. Laws won't stop you fromtossing a junk food bag out of your car window, but understandingthat you need a healthy Earth for your own long-term survival notonly might stop you from tossing the bag but would probably stop youfrom abusing your body with fast food in the first place.Through ancestor worship, Ifa allows you to experience life as acontinuum. And once you have, nothing will ever be the same again.The same kind of attitude changes and life changes that have affectednearly every individual who has gone through what we call a near-death experience, who has experienced the other dimension and thenbeen brought back, testifies to the effect of this knowledge.

For the basicritual all you need is a clear glass, natural water, a white candle, andthe discipline to set aside thirteen minutes a day for seven consecutivedays. For seven consecutive days, at the exact same time each day, youwill light the candle and offer prayers to your blood ancestors. You willcall each name three times, and, after offering your love and yourthanks, after offering the water for coolness and refreshment and thecandle for light and energy, you may bring your problems to them. Thisdoesn't mean asking them for a new pair of shoes or for your lover tocall that night. We only ask our ancestors to intervene in serious lifesituations. The loss of a job, illness, the breakup of a relationship—these are the kinds of issues for which it is proper to ask their help. Ifno serious problems exist, then simply ask them for guidance in yourlife, health for you and those you love, and prosperity for your home.For example, my prayers go something like this:Ajuba (blessings) to all my departed ancestors. Particular blessingsand thankfulness to my father, Mortimer Neimark, my father, MortimerNeimark, my father, Mortimer Neimark. Also to my mother, HortenseNeimark, Hortense Neimark, Hortense Neimark; to my son AdamNeimark, Adam Neimark, Adam Neimark, and to all my children whodid not reach term; to my grandparents John and Lillian Peters, Johnand Lillian Peters, John and Lillian Peters; Charles and Etta Neimark,Charles and Etta Neimark, Charles and Etta Neimark; to my great un-cles Stanley Neimark, Stanley Neimark, Stanley Neimark, ArthurPeters, Arthur Peters, Arthur Peters, Norman Peters, Norman Peters,Norman Peters; to my great aunts Genevieve Neimark, GenevieveNeimark, Genivieve Neimark, and Lucy Ribback Peters, Lucy RibbackPeters, Lucy Ribback Peters; to my great-grandmother Nancy Peters,Nancy Peters, Nancy Peters, as well as all those whose names I do notknow but whose blood runs through my veins.

May that guidance continueto open my paths and roads and the paths and roads of those I love. Mayyour strength and energy give health to me and those I love. May yourwisdom bring love and prosperity into my home.This is simply an outline, and I think you'll find that if a lot is goingon in your life, your prayers will be more complex. Also, the settingcan be much more elaborate. Most priests I know put a table in onecorner of a room and place as many photographs of their ancestors onit as possible. A quick word of caution: the pictures should containonly deceased relatives; it is acceptable for you to appear in the pic-tures but not any other living being lest he or she join the deceased.You might place some of your ancestors' favorite items on the table,too. For example, my shrine has Parliament cigarettes for my motherand father, cards for all those who played bridge and other games, cof-fee for them all, along with an occasional cigar, fruit, candy, honey, oranything else I feel they might appreciate.Be aware that when you take a specific problem to your ancestors,the solution may come in many forms. It is possible one of your ances-tors will appear in your dreams and offer a suggestion or solution.Perhaps you will suddenly get a flash or insight into the problem, orperhaps the problem will simply cease to exist for no apparent reason.So when you are asking your ancestors for help, it is important to beopen and aware and to keep a pencil and paper by your bed so thatwhen you awaken from a dream, you can jot it down before it fadesinto the morning.A few answers to the questions I know you will have:Do I let the candle burn?You can, but it is not necessary. You can put the candle out after thethirteen minutes and relight it the next day.Do I keep giving new water?No. The fresh natural water (bottled spring water, for example)should be placed on the shrine and allowed to slowly evaporate overthe seven days. This symbolizes your ancestors' drinking.ANCESTOR WORSHIP27"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Do I have to do it at night?No. You may do it any time of the day or night.

All you need is thewater, candle, and your prayers.What happens if I'm traveling?If you leave during the course of the seven days, simply continue thesequence wherever you are staying. Be sure to adjust the time towhen you were doing it at home. For example, if you were prayingeach night at 11:14 P.M. in Chicago, you would pray at 12:14 A.M. inNew York or 9:14 P.M. in Los Angeles. Remember, you can do it any-where—at your friend's home, at Howard Johnson's, or at your sum-mer cottage.Can I keep a candle going all the time?Yes. You may work with your shrine in any way you like.

Indeed, in the close to three years I spent trying togain religious status and approval for exemption from the IRS and theJustice Department, the most difficult hurdle I had to overcome wastheir apprehension about blood sacrifice. Ultimately they acted fairlyand granted my Ifa Foundation of North America full religious status.My personal experience has been that nobody, no matter how\"morally\" opposed to animal sacrifice, will hesitate for one moment toavail themselves of its power when all other approaches have failed.The mother whose child is dying, the individual about to lose a job or abusiness, or the man or woman facing a potentially devastating courtcase will have absolutely no qualms about using blood sacrifice tosolve apparently insoluble problems.We use specific animals for specific problems:▲Sheep and pigeons for long life▲Hen or female goat to get a wife▲ Rooster, male goat, or ram to get a husband▲Rooster, male goat, or ram to overcome enemies▲Rooster, male goat, or ram for good health▲Pigeons for money, particularly eight white doves to Obatala▲ Hen or female goat for children▲Rooster, male goat, or ram for court cases▲Ram, male goat, rooster, or tortoise to prevent misfortune▲Pig, guinea fowl, or fish to become prosperous▲Ducks, roosters, hens, or female goats for many children andgrandchildrenSACRIFICE35"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Like most Americans, my experience with death, before my involve-ment with Ifa, had always been somewhat surreal. Death was some-thing to be avoided. Everything from our funerals to our supermarketsare designed to camouflage or disguise death. Whereas my great-grandmother may have gone out in the yard, grabbed a hen, wrung itsneck, plucked its feathers, and prepared it for dinner, my only experi-ence with dead animals was seeing them in the refrigerator case atour local supermarket. The chicken or the roast, carefully wrapped inits Styrofoam packaging, bears little resemblance to the living animalfrom which it came. So too, with funerals. We distance ourselves fromdeath. Embalming removes all traces of blood, and the departed ismade up and dressed to appear as \"lifelike\" as possible. That's the waywe want it.We intentionally block awareness that the body of someone who hasdied is simply an empty container. Instead we cling to the \"body\" asthe thing—even if it is void of life and energy. Death is the ultimateenemy, so we pretend it doesn't exist. Ifa understands that you cannotbe truly alive unless and until you understand death. And animal sac-rifice is part of that understanding.Blood sacrifice, as frightening and abhorrent as it is to those who donot understand it, is absolutely necessary if major change is to takeplace. It would be far easier for a twentieth-century European baba-lawo such as myself to simply say, \"Blood sacrifice may have been rele-vant or acceptable hundreds or thousands of years ago, but in today's'enlightened' world, simple offerings of fruit or wine will suffice.\" Itwould be far easier, but it would be untrue.In Ifa we sacrifice only to improve or save people's lives. We valuethe lives of animals, but we value the lives of humans more. When ananimal sacrifice is called for, the animal is offered with respect,prayer, and as little pain as possible. We understand what the animalis giving up for us, and we are grateful. For those who have forgotten,this was the very message we were to derive from the death of Jesus—that through his sacrifice our lives would be improved. I can assureyou that the animals that occupy the sterile, environmentally pollut-ing packages in your supermarket were not treated with respect or36THE WAY OF IFA"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"offered in prayer. To the Ifa devotee, that, and not animal sacrifice, issenseless slaughter.I think that part of our fear of sacrifice is actually fear of feelings.In our culture, we use the left (linear) hemisphere of our brains almostexclusively, rarely allowing ourselves to experience profound feelingsof any kind. We tend to live in an emotional middle zone. In so doing,we may ward off intense pain, but we also give up the opportunity forintense pleasure. When we witness or take part in an animal sacrifice,it is not possible to modulate or contain our feelings. I believe that it isthe fear of that kind of intensity and what it will do, more than actualconcern about the death of the animal, that shapes most people's atti-tudes about sacrifice.They're not wrong. The act of animal sacrifice is pure feeling andenergy, and no one participating in one can fail to be touched andchanged from its power. But that is the point. Since the beginning oftime, in every culture and every religion, sacrifice has been used to ac-cess that world of power. It cannot be intellectualized. It can only beexperienced.Though animal rights activists who disapprove of what we do un-doubtedly mean well, I believe that they are in denial of death. Intheir zeal to \"protect,\" they defend themselves against the heightenedemotion that accompanies any thoughts of death. Ifa works with theseemotions, in harmony with and respect for the planet. We would neverneedlessly harm an animal. We would never, under any circum-stances, sacrifice an endangered species. When it becomes necessaryto offer a rooster, goat, sheep, or pigeon for the life or well-being of an-other human, it is done with reverence and respect. . . for the animaland the individual. Without that mutual respect, the babalawo, nomatter how skilled or learned, can accomplish very little. One mustunderstand the threads of the universe if one hopes to rearrangethem.In Ifa, blood sacrifice is usually undertaken only for major problemsand for initiation. When an animal has been used to remove illnessor misfortune, its flesh is not eaten. When an animal is offered as partof the process of initiation or for the enhancement of some joyousSACRIFICE37"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"moment such as childbirth, marriage, or the opening of a new busi-ness, the animal will be skinned and prepared for cooking. The meatof that animal is thought to carry powerful ase, or energy, and is goodfor all who partake. In this, Ifa is very similar to the Hebraic conceptof kosher. The animal is made kosher when the rabbi lets its bloodwhile offering prayers to God. The act of making something kosherwas not intended to be restrictive but rather transcendent; the indi-vidual eating the kosher food is supposed to acquire the spirituality ofthe sacrifice itself. And as in the Jewish tradition, in Ifa only a trainedholy person (babalawo, or priest) who has been initiated into the use ofthe knife can perform the ceremonies.I attended my first animal sacrifice about a year after my first read-ing. I was about to receive Yemonja/Olukun, a major Yoruba orisa, andthe ceremony involved animal sacrifice. When the animals werebrought in and the babalawo reached for his knife, a kind of horribledread rushed through me. I couldn't identify exactly what it was, butit was some combination of dread and wonder at what my own reac-tion would be. Would I get sick to my stomach? Would I get dizzy orfaint? Would I have nightmares afterward? These and dozens of simi-lar fears ran through my mind as I forced myself to watch. Then thebabalawo motioned for me to come forward. He had taken the head ofthe animal and was holding it firmly between his hands.\"Philip,\" he said, \"I want you to touch your forehead to the foreheadof the animal. I want you to thank the animal for giving his life foryou, and I want you to clearly state the problem you need solved.\"Well, that stripped me of my spectator status and added to the al-most overwhelming fear that was bubbling inside me. Yet, when I bentover and pressed my forehead to the animal's, everything changed.Suddenly, I no longer felt as if I were being forced to witness deathfrom some impersonal viewpoint. Instead, as my head made unionwith the animal's head, I sensed its life and energy. I was filled with acombination of sadness and gratitude, with respect and humility, withunderstanding and acceptance. As I stood back and watched the ba-balawo begin his sacrificial prayers I was no longer afraid.

Most of the orisa wereangry, but they were also afraid to interfere. Only Orunmila took ac-tion. One day, while Icu was distracted, Orunmila snatched leu's ham-mer and hid it away. When Icu discovered that his instrument of deathhad disappeared, he was furious. He stormed his way to Orunmila'shouse and demanded that the hammer be returned. Orunmila refused.I\"I must have my hammer,\" Icu shouted.\"No,\" replied Orunmila, \"you were charged by Oludumare to takethose whose time has come, and instead you have been taking humansanytime it pleases you.\"\"If people do not die, the earth will die!\" Icu responded.\"You have no right to take people before their time,\" Orunmilacountered.And so the argument raged on. Indeed, it raged for hundreds or per-haps thousands of years, until finally Orunmila realized the logic inwhat Icu said. If people never died, the earth would be unable to feedthem all. Still, Orunmila was not willing to concede. Finally he sum-moned the desperate and chastened Icu to his compound.\"Icu,\" Orunmila began, \"I have thought long and hard about return-ing your hammer. It is true that if humans do not die, the earth mustperish. But it is also true that you cannot remove people whenever themood strikes you. So I have reached a solution. I will return your ham-mer to you, but with one condition.\"\"Anything!\" Icu shouted.\"Well then,\" Orunmila replied, \"I will return your hammer on thecondition that you swear never to take my children before their time.\"\"I promise!\" Icu said, but pausing, he asked, \"How will I know yourchildren?\"\"They will wear my ide (bracelet) on their left wrists.\"DEATH AND REBIRTH43"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"To this day, Ifa followers wear a two-colored, beaded bracelet, fedand blessed by the babalawo, on their left wrists. In so doing theyguarantee that Death, should Icu visit early, will respect his pact withOrunmila and not return until their preordained time.Many of my godchildren have asked, \"Why, when Ifa believes inblood reincarnation, would it be such a tragedy to die before yourtime?\" It's a good question with an important answer.Ifa teaches that \"Earth is the marketplace and Heaven our home.\"Aye lojaOrun nileA difa fun Oludumare, agotunOba ataye ma tuuBee dele ayeBee gbagbe orunAye lojaOrun nileE o jiyinE o jaboOun ti e riOyeku-Ogbe.The world is a marketplaceIkole Orun is our permanent home.Cast divination oracle for OludumareThe perfect organizer of the world.If you come to the world and forget Ikole OrunNote that the world is just a marketplaceWhereas Ikole Orun is our permanent home.In the intricate structure of rebirth, we visit Earth for specificlearning and growth experiences, and when they have been achieved,we return \"home.\" To leave before we have attained that particularwisdom and knowledge is disruptive. Premature death interrupts thecycle, both from a time and from a learning perspective, and causes us44THE WAY OF IFA"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"to metaphorically lose our place in line. It is likely that the Catholicconcept of limbo, in which the soul is trapped in a never-never land be-tween Heaven and Hell, is an adaptation of this ancient idea.To understand the importance of a \"proper\" death, it is essential tounderstand the significance of rebirth. In Ifa, we do not believe inreincarnation in the usual sense. Reincarnation implies a number ofconditions, including the migration of the soul from one body to an-other—its destiny determined, in large part, by the life it lived thistime around. Reincarnation also includes concepts such as karma, orcoming back as a more or a less highly evolved being. One could returnas any kind of matter—a toad, a mushroom, or a stone. The teachingsof Ifa are significantly different. We believe in rebirth within the fam-ily. The Yoruba names Babatunde (Father returns), Yetunde (Motherreturns), Jabatunji (Father wakes once again), and Sotunde (the wiseman returns) all offer vivid literal evidence about the Ifa concept of fa-milial or bloodline rebirth.I remember calling my friend and teacher Afolabi Epega shortlyafter my father died. After expressing his sorrow at my loss, hejovially stated, \"Well, your next child can be Babatunde!\" It is thisunderstanding that allows us to feel sorrow at the passing of lovedones along with the joy that, through our children and our children'schildren, we can provide for their return.There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great unclewill \"come back\" in the birth of your child, however. Ifa teaches thatwe all have a \"perfect twin\" or double. When the time arrives for aspirit to return to Earth through the conception of a new life in the di-rect blood lineage of the family, one of the component entities returnswhile the other remains in Heaven. The spirit that returns does so inthe form of a guardian Ori. One's guardian Ori, which is representedand contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spiritand energy of one's previous blood relative but the accumulated wis-dom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes. This is notto be confused with one's spiritual Ori, which contains destiny, but in-stead refers to the coming back to Earth of one's personal blood Orithrough one's new life and experiences.In Ifa we constantly remind the devotee that \"you crown your ownhead.\" Too often this is interpreted to mean \"you make your own lifeDEATH AND REBIRTH45"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"happen\" or \"you are responsible for most of what occurs.\" Althoughthat is true, it means much more. It literally means \"the crown of yourhead, or Ori.\" Through ancestor worship and offerings you can accessor take advantage of the accumulated wisdom that has been given yousince conception. Through the act of creating children and the cycle ofrebirth, you continue the process, you increase the knowledge, andyou provide for the continuation of the flow and for the \"crowning\" ofthe next generation. For this, children become the greatest blessing inour lives. The Odu Iworidi addresses this issue specifically:Kosi abiyamo ti ko lee bi Awo I'omoKosi abiyamo ti ko lee be Orunmila.Baba eni, bioba bi ni ni pipe,Bopetiti, a tun nbi Baba eni I'omo.A daa f 'Orunmila, ti o wipe:Oun maa m'Orun bo wa si aye,Oun maa mu Aye lo s'Orun.Ki o baa le se bee dandan,Ifa ni ki o ru ohun-gbogbo ni mejimeji,Abo ati Ako bayi: Agbo kan, Agutan kan,Okuko kan, Ewure kan, Akuko-adiye kan,Agbedo-ayiye kan; ati beebee lo.O gbo o rubo.Bee ni aye nbisii ti won si nre sii.There is no child-bearing woman who cannot give birth toan Ifa priest.There is no child-bearing woman who cannot give birth toOrunmila.Our father, if he gives birth to us in full,Inevitably we shall in time give birth to him in turn.Our mother, if she gives birth to us in full,Inevitably we shall give birth to her in turn.46THE WAY OF IFA"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"What this means is that if your father or mother gives birth to you infull, someday you or your children will give birth to them in turn. It isthe continuity and glue that provides the Ifa devotee with the abilityto live life to its fullest, without fear of death.Death is only to be feared when it occurs prematurely, especially inunborn or very young children. Their spirits, known as abiku, are saidto be souls who are seeking to torment their parents. Their earlydeaths are often followed by another one a year or so later. In order tobreak the chain of death, the babalawo is usually consulted. A smalliron chain, which has been specially prepared by the babalawo, is at-tached to the left ankle of the child upon birth. This will \"hold thechild to the earth\" and prevent his or her death. My own son, Dashiel,whose half-brother died at nine weeks of age, wore such an anklet.The doctors at the hospital may have thought it strange, but the an-klet was placed on his left leg just moments after birth, and the hospi-tal staff was informed not to remove it under any circumstances.Long life is such a requirement for Ifa devotees that verse afterverse of our poetry and prayers refer to it. Indeed, it is said that an in-dividual can be buried only by those younger, and in the distant pastabiku, or those who died before their time, were given no formal fu-neral rites. A famous Ifa prayer says, \"May I know the blessing ofbeing buried by my son.\"So, in Ifa, death is simply the passageway from the marketplace(Earth) to Heaven. Rebirth is the return of the soul as part of the in-carnation of a new blood relative. And when a body has grown old andtired, when its destiny has been fulfilled and the wisdom and experi-ence of a lifetime accumulated, then it is time to shed the old body, re-plenish the spirit, and prepare to return reborn and refreshed.DEATH AND REBIRTH47"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"FIVE///////////THE DAYS OF THE WEEK49"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"MONDAY (Ojo Aje)Day for Financial Success.

Their combined powers were so greatthat whatever wishes the inhabitants made were destined to come topass. There was one exception: Oludumare decreed that the wishes ofthe inhabitants must be positive in nature. He also informed the visi-tors that they would have only seven days to spend in the Ogbeise.Immediately, Esu-Odara (the divine messenger or intermediary be-tween human being and orisa, human and God) prayed for prosperityof all kinds to fill the garden. As Oludumare had promised, the wishwas granted, and almost instantly the garden was filled with everyconceivable kind of wealth. The inhabitants of the garden decided toshare their wealth with those outside and spent the entire day spread-ing their wealth throughout the world. That night Oludumare in-quired as to how they had spent their day. When they related theiractivities to him, he named the day Ojo Aje, the day of financial suc-cess and prosperity. The day was Monday.The next day Oludumare urged them to continue to pray for benefi-cial things. But those outside the sacred garden, who had receivedwealth the day before, rushed inside looking for more treasures. Quar-rels ensued, but those properly inside used the power of the sixteensacred odus to command victory over the invaders. The wish immedi-ately came to pass, and the outsiders were subdued and driven away.THE DAYS OF THE WEEK51"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"At day's end, when Oludumare reviewed their behavior, he named thisday Ojo Isegun, the day of victory. This was Tuesday.Early on the third day, a powerful wind blew into the sacred garden.The clarity and beauty of the Ogbeise was distorted with dust anddirt; plants and flowers perished. Those inside spent their entire daycleaning and washing, trying to keep their possessions from blowingaway. They were so involved with the storm that they forgot to pray,and nothing got organized. When Oludumare came that evening, theytold him about the events. Consequently, Oludumare named the dayOjo Riru, the day of confusion. It was WednesdayThe next day, following the dust storm, those inside prayed for rainand for order to be restored. Their wishes were granted and rain cameto feed the new crops and the vegetation that had been destroyed bythe dust storm. Life inside the garden returned to normal. All theorisa were happy and continued to pray for all the good things in life.That evening they realized this was the best day they had ever wit-nessed. When they informed Oludumare of their happiness, he namedthe day Ojo Asededaye or Ojo Bo, the day of fulfillment. The day wasThursday.Oludumare then informed them to prepare for a long journey thefollowing morning. Early the next day they all prayed for a safe jour-ney to their destination. The distance they traveled was astronomicaland the potential hardships severe, but because they had prayed for asafe journey, they had no problems reaching their destination. On theirreturn, however, it was a different story. Every unforeseen obstacle in-terfered with their progress. The day was completely ruined as theyfought to overcome each difficulty. Indeed, they began to doubt theywould ever return to their sacred garden. Finally, they summoned alltheir powers and were able to fight their way back to the Ogbeise inthe dead of night. They all vowed never again to undertake a journeylike this on that day again. Due to these events, Oludumare namedthis day Ojo Ete, day of trouble or turbulence. The day was Friday.On the sixth day, Oludumare summoned Esu-Odara and informedhim that he had decided that Esu-Odara could not control all richesand wealth on Earth. Instead, he himself would regulate their flowand disbursement through sacrifice and ritual.

They all prayed for theseevents. At the end of the day, Oludumare summoned all 401 orisa to-gether in the Ogbeise. He informed them that their wish could not begranted, because they had violated one of the rules of the sacred gar-den: they had prayed for evil things to occur, not positive things. Be-cause of this, Oludumare named this day Ojo Abameta, the day ofthree evil resolutions. The day was Saturday.On the seventh day, Oludumare came out full of life and power. Hebegan to shower blessings on all the orisa that had opposed him, in-cluding Esu-Odara. They were all happy once again and ashamed attheir selfish behavior of the previous day.

He sentfor them so that they could carry his treasures to Earth. They wereasked to sacrifice a large lump of pounded yam, a potful of soup, manykola nuts, sheep, pigeon, fowls, and 3,200 cowries and to use the sacri-fices to entertain visitors. Oludumare's messenger reached all 401irunmoles and delivered the message, but none of them entertainedthe messenger with the ordered sacrifices. When the messengerreached Orunmila, he was welcomed heartily and entertained withfood. Because of this kindness, the messenger disclosed to Orunmilathat he should not be very anxious about carrying the treasures be-cause the most important one was underneath Oludumare's seat.OWhen the irunmoles assembled, they were told of Oludumare's mes-sage, and all of them were struggling for what they believed to be themost valuable contents.

Orunmila met the other irunmoles at the terminus of the roadleading from Heaven to Earth and asked them what was wrong. Theyresponded that the earth was covered with water, and there was noplace for them to land. Then Orunmila dipped his hand into the snail'sshell and took out a net, which he cast upon the water. He dipped hishand inside the shell a second time and brought out earth, which hecast upon the net.

The place whereOrunmila stood, as the first person on Earth, and decreed the world beexpanded, is to this day called Ifa-Wara in Ile Ife.The 401 irunmoles descended after Orunmila, who created the landand first tread upon it. He did not allow any of the irunmoles to de-scend onto the land until he had accepted all that they had broughtwith them and gave to them what he saw fit. They joyfully receivedtheir portions.The irunmole were those supernatural beings from Ikole Orun(Heaven) who first visited Ikole Aye (Earth). It was they who madeEarth habitable for human beings. They are the energy from which allof nature derives. Orunmila, who made it possible for the irunmole todescend to Earth, accepted only 256 of them, including Ogun, god ofmetals and creativity; Obatala, god of creation; Sango, god of thunder;Osun, river goddess; Ososi, god of hunting; Esu, god of justice; Os-onyin, god of medicine; and, most intelligent of all, reverently calledgod of intelligence or knowledge, Orunmila.These irunmole were not born of Earth, nor would they die here.They were the link between human beings and Oludumare (God) atthe creation of the earth, and they are the only link now. Individuallyand collectively they serve as the medium through which Oludumareimparts to humankind his scientific knowledge of nature in generaland his esoteric knowledge of words, known as Ifa.Once they had brought Oludumare's treasures to Earth, the irun-mole ascended to Ikole Orun (Heaven) and did not return. Becausethey had acted as mentors and teachers, their departure left a gap orvoid between human beings and Oludumare. How could human beingscontinue to communicate with God?

These included theirtools, their images, or the media by which they had descended to IkoleAye or ascended back to Ikole Orun, such as the ope Ifa, or sacred palmtree, which is used extensively by Orunmila as well as others.There are many other examples:Ogun, sent by Oludumare to teach humans blacksmithing and met-allurgy, is usually summoned esoterically by using iron objects or themariwo (palm frond) as objects of invocation.Orunmila, also known as Ela (the Pure) and the only irunmole tohave brought down the wisdom of Oludumare through the teachingsof Ifa, is invoked through the ikin Ifa, or sacred fortified palm kernel,from the sacred palm tree ope Ifa.Sango, orisa of thunder, is invoked with the ose (double-headed ax),edun ara (thunderstone/celt), orogbo (bitter kola nut), epo (red palmoil), and others. The double-headed ax was Sango's symbol of officeduring his time on Earth; thunderstones are created when lightningstrikes rocks; bitter kola was one of his favorite foods; red palm oil wasa medicinal antidote for his annoyance.Esu, orisa of ase and opportunity, was the alias of Esu-Odara, Ola-ilu, Elegba, and Oriki Oko, among others. He was the town savior,who moved about with a stone. Today the yangi, or sacred stone thatrepresents Esu, is used to call his spirit.Obatala or Oosanla, orisa of creation, is invoked with ofun (chalk),lead, or a small metal bell.Osun, orisa of sweet waters, is invoked through a clay pot or vesselfilled with sacred stones from the river.Osonyin, orisa of herbs and medicine, has ere (his image) as well asthe mariwo (palm frond) for calling his spirit.To this day, the orisa are invoked through these same sacred objects.Invocation is a powerful tool for positive change, and as you learnabout the major orisa in the chapters to come, it will become clear whycertain orisa are called for specific problems and how this came to be.INTHE BEGINNING . . .59"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"PART TWO///////////THE WAY OF THE ORISA61"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ORUNMILAORUNMILA!

Only the extremely foolhardywould go ahead with anything as serious as marriage, a new businessventure, the conception of a child, or treatment of a mental or physicalillness without seeking the guidance of Orunmila through the baba-lawo.AIfa teaches that Orunmila was attendant at the act of creationalong with Oludumare (God). Because of this, Orunmila was also thewitness of fate and knows the likelihood of all future events. It is saidthat he lived on Earth for many years but that one day, tired and dis-appointed with the behavior of humans, he returned to Heaven andvowed never again to return to Earth.

The good ajogun control wealth,children, wives/husbands, success, love, and so on. The evil ajogun con-trol death, illness, loss, mental unrest, and similar forces.

These missionaries confusedEsu's ability to trick and punish those who do not sacrifice with an in-nate predisposition to do so. Esu does punish, but he does not punishcapriciously. Esu rewards, but he does not reward the undeserving.His apparent contradictions are not contradictory at all. Rather, theyare logical responses to the behavior of those he deals with. From aChristian viewpoint of divine forgiveness, the actions of Esu towardthose who ignore their obligations might indeed seem extremely harshand unforgiving, the work of \"a devil.\" Yet, in the Yoruba cosmology—in which the universe contains all possibilities, both good and bad, andindividuals have opportunities for controlling their own destinies byworking with natural forces—the failure to control one's own destinyis seen as an act of gross stupidity with potentially dire consequences.Esu is in charge of those consequences!To those who work with and not against the natural order of theuniverse, who \"sacrifice\" in both the literal and the philosophicalmeaning of the word, the potential is unlimited and the rewards be-yond comprehension. Esu is in charge of these as well! As in all thingsin Ifa, the individual \"crowns his own head.\" The decision to wear acrown or a dunce cap is a personal matter, and Esu awaits your deci-sion. Devotees of Esu often refer to him as \"Baba\" or Father. They areknown as Esubiyi (son of Esu) or Esugbayi (one claimed by Esu).Esu's own cap is often the subject of his mythology. A famousYoruba story centers around two farmers, both neighbors and friends,who had failed to sacrifice. Esu, in his tricolored hat, one-third red,one-third white, and one-third blue, walked down a road between thetwo offending farmers.\"Did you notice the fellow in the red hat?\" the first farmer asked.74THE WAY OFTHE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"\"No,\" replied his friend and neighbor, \"there was a fellow whopassed this way, but his hat was blue and white.\"\"You're wrong,\" insisted the first.\"No, you're being insulting,\" retorted the second.And soon, the insults increased, and a physical fight began. The twowere dragged before the local oba, where each told his story.

The lesson, hopefully, was learned.Esu's ability to appear instantly is one of his many magical attrib-utes.

It is a living,breathing, palpable flow of energy that can either increase or diminish,depending upon our behavior.It is believed that after Oludumare created such evil things as death,disease, illness, pestilence, plague, temper, jealousy, fighting, and loss,and after he created such blessings as love, wives, husbands, children,money, and long life, he created Esu's powers. Esu's powers allowed himto control or limit the excesses of evil, whose powers would otherwisehave been unlimited. By controlling the powers of evil through sacrifice,Esu makes available to the men and women who dwell on Earth theblessings of the good things and the orisa that symbolize them.This is in no way meant to suggest that Esu is some solemn dis-penser of justice. Indeed, that would be as far as possible from thetruth and totally at odds with the Yoruba paradigm of life. Zorba theGreek could well have been Yoruba, for Yorubas believe that life ismeant to be enjoyed. It is the enjoyment of life that Esu symbolizes,and he himself enjoys every minute of every day.He loves music and dance costumes and laughter. He loves goodfood and wine. Moderation is a characteristic of other orisa, not Esu.He wants what he wants, and he wants it now.

He is a real and powerful en-ergy source. Be careful of what you ask.

A devotee went to his Esu and began rubbingpalm kernel oil on the figure. Now, in the mythology of Ifa, palm ker-nel oil is something that Esu simply hates! While rubbing the oil ontothe figure, the man said, \"Esu, I know you hate this substance, and ifit were up to me, I would never give it to you, but so-and-so insisted Igive it to you.\" Having placed the forces in action, he was depending78THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"upon Esu to visit his wrath upon the man who supposedly instructedhim to give Esu the offending substance.

You, as thishandsome prince of the Yoruba pantheon, can be big or small, good orbad, caring or cruel, generous or selfish, loving or self-absorbed.

Neither he,nor the universe we are part of, \"forgives.\" If we survive our mistakes,we learn from them. If we place dunce caps on our heads, we must re-move them. If we sacrifice, we prosper and survive.That is Esu's role. Though carefree, fun-loving, and loath to be \"tieddown,\" his sense of justice is greater than any orisa other thanObatala and Ogun. And his free-wheeling life-style and love of merri-ment are not contradictions to that sense of justice any more than areany of his other actions. Rather, they are the examples that will hope-fully erase our ingrained sense of foreboding, impotence, and helpless-ness about life and our role in it.

This is particularly true forwomen.For example, one of the most famous tales of Oguntells of a time when he was walking through the woods and came upona group of his godchildren or followers sitting in a circle. They had ob-viously been partaking heartily from the many palm wine bottles thatdotted the landscape. Ogun, hot and weary from his journey, lookeddown at the men and asked for a drink. The men only giggled. In-stantly, Ogun drew his sword and beheaded each and every one ofthem. It is this white-hot anger at real or imagined injustice that ismost difficult for Westerners to understand and control. Having satis-fied his anger, he reached down for a bottle of wine, only to find itempty Bottle after bottle provided the same results. Ogun realizedthat the men had not been rude but simply had nothing to offer, and inthe contrition of the moment, Ogun threw himself upon his sword androse to Heaven. From this moment forward, all followers of Ogun, aswell as many other orisa worshipers, are careful to lay a bottle on itsside once it is empty so that no confusion or harm will befall them.OAnother story of Ogun takes place in the Yoruba town of Ire Ekiti.During their Oriki Festival, the townspeople enjoy their food andpalm wine in absolute silence, as verbal communication is not allowed.Ogun, returning from his exploits as a warrior, becomes lost in the for-est and stumbles upon the Oriki gathering.

This infuriates Ogun, and he kills the innocents.A passerby enlightens him as to his whereabouts and about the si-lence of the Oriki Festival. He realizes he has slaughtered his ownpeople.

And the higher our economic and educational status, the moreingrained is this behavior. As a result of years of being scolded, disci-plined, or put down for \"reacting,\" many children of Ogun learned torepress their primary energy source to the point that they are some-times confused, on the surface at least, with children of Obatala orYemonja. This repression tends to have the most damaging effect onwomen, and it can even be extremely dangerous.Years ago, a lovely young girl was brought to me by her mother. Herreadings contained several references to male orisa warrior energy.Her problem, as it turned out, was that she had physically attackedanother girl and had hurt her quite badly. The fact that the two hadbeen competing for the same young man only slightly mitigated whathad become an involved legal ordeal for the young girl as her formerfriend's parents pressed charges. As it turned out, there were similaroccurrences in her past.Here was a beautiful teenager who had, through social pressureand parental and societal expectations, learned to repress her instinc-tive responses. So instead of getting angry or speaking out early on,she repressed her instinctive orisa reactions until, on occasion, theysimply exploded in the kind of inappropriate behavior that broughther to me for help.The children of Ogun must not repress. Though it is not appropriateto lop off the head of someone who cuts you off in traffic or makes apass at your spouse, it is essential that you do something to get it offyour chest when you feel it.Children of Ogun must understand the totality of their energy andnot just its explosive side. To do this you must first examine the oduthat brought Ogun into the world, Ogundameji.86THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Alagbara ni napkun Ade li o difa fi'Ogun, a miki o ru.Agada, akuko-adiye ati esun-isu.

He was advised to sacrificea cutlass, a cock, and a roasted yam. He was told that he must always goabout with his sword because that was his fortune. He was told to eatroasted yam. He did so. He was thirsty after this and went to the river todrink water. As he finished drinking, he saw two figures fighting over afish they had caught. He advised them to be patient and to go home andshare the fish. They ignored him. The first man told him he came fromthe East and the second from the West, at which point Ogun took hissword and cut the fish in two. The first thanked him and requested thathe cut open a footpath from where they were to his town and said thathe would enrich Ogun's life if he did. He further said that Ogun wouldreceive valuable things that would give him confidence. The other manalso thanked him and made the same request. Ogun agreed, and he hasbeen known as Ogundameji since the day he cut the fish into two.Properly used, this sense of justice and strength can lead to benefi-cial results and rewards. Ogun's forcing of the compromise on the menby cutting the fish in two is a good example of this and confirms hisdivination, which had indicated that his sword would enrich him.Ogun, the orisa of iron and metals, is a fierce warrior of brutestrength, a loner by nature. No orisa man has ever gone to battle with-out invoking the powers and protection of this mighty warrior. Yet theodu that incarnates Ogun into this world is not an example of hisOGUN87"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Mask of Ogun in his hunter aspect, worn on top of the worshiper's head, southwestNigeria, c. 1950.88THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"tremendous potential for physical action on every level but a call forcompromise—an example of the diplomat, not the impetuous primalforce.This is an essential lesson for the children of Ogun. In the mythol-ogy of the syncretized versions of Ifa, too often the Ogun archetype isdepicted as an almost brutish lout, taking wine, women, and war ashis daily fare. Portraying him as the diplomat is meant in no way todiminish the raw power of this orisa of metals.Ogun has many facets and aspects. He is the father of iron, and, assuch, in ancient times his children could be classified into three majorcategories: warriors, hunters, and farmers. Each was dependent uponthe orisa of metal for success in his trade. Still today, knives, spears,arrows, and hoes are among the implements that represent Ogun.But let me emphasize again that Ogun is not only the orisa of metal,he is the creator with it, and his creative energy is as powerful as hiswarrior self. Ogun is also concerned with ethics and justice. In Nigeria,for untold years, oaths have been taken by swearing on a piece of metalrepresenting Ogun. Even through the British occupation, the Britishcourts would accept this form of oath within their courts.Ogun's nature is both vital and violent. His creativity can take theform of teacher, mediator, inventor, or counselor. It can also takethe form of warrior, accident, or calamity. It is often in the process ofbreaking down that new things can be created.Ogun is, by nature, an extremely hard worker. It is his ability towork almost ceaselessly and with little rest that allowed him to createcivilization. This was, in part, the task he was assigned by Oludu-mare. Yet, as with all orisa qualities, there is an up side and a downside. For Ogun and his children, the down side is that their work isnever done. For the children of Ogun, there will be no retirement tosandy beaches; instead, there will always be something more to do.For some of us this would prove an unbearable burden, but for chil-dren of Ogun, it is simply the way things are. Work is what they bothenjoy and do best, and pleasures are taken intensely and quickly.OGUN89"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The thing that is the most difficult for Ogun's children to come togrips with also comes from Ogundameji, the odu that brought Ogun toEarth.Okelegbongbo—as'ofun-kilo li o difa f'Ogun, won ni: biobarubo, a koniigbo iku re laelae, gbogbo aye li o miamaa bee pe: kiobawon tun iwawon se, sugbon kosi eni kan ninu won ti yoo baa duro ro ti ara re.

He was advised to sacri-fice four rams and four large covered calabash so that he might not die,that the whole world would always request him to pave the way forthem, but no one would share the sorrow with him in his life.Children of Ogun, perhaps because of their solitary nature, willtend to hold their emotional pain inside them. This is not to be mis-taken for anger, which, as I have clearly pointed out earlier, is easilyexpressed by the great warrior orisa. It is emotions like sorrow, loss,or disappointment that Oguns tend to hide or deny, and perhaps thatis why their sorrows will seldom be understood or shared by others.Children of Ogun often carry a single chain link in their pockets,for, as Ogundameji states, \"A single chain link does not break.\" I be-lieve this relates as much to the emotional pressures Oguns will haveto bear alone as to any physical threat. Ogun, without help, is morethan able to handle the physical universe. If you are a child of Ogun,you would be well advised to keep the single link with you at all times.Oguns are also highly sexual and would tend to have more than theaverage number of children. If there is one Ogun weakness, it wouldhave to be the opposite sex. Oguns, who are normally clearheaded anddetermined, will find their resolve melting away over a member of theopposite sex.A famous Ogun tale explains how Ogun had tired of everyone's con-stant demands and left civilization for the forest. Without his toolsand metals, civilization came to a halt. All the other orisa pleadedwith him to return . . . to no avail. Finally Osun, the orisa of sexuallove and money, took her five scarves and pot of honey and went near90THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"to where Ogun was hiding. She did not call to him or look at or forhim. Instead, she began a sensuous dance with her scarves while oc-casionally dipping into her honey pot and placing the nectar on hershiny lips.

Closer and closer he crept, until he was just inches away fromthis alluring creature. It was then that Osun reached into her honeypot and spread the honey on Ogun's lips. It was too much even for thiswarrior orisa. Ogun, forgetting his determination, followed Osunback to civilization, and life for the people of Earth could once againprogress.In today's world, Ogun is in charge of all weapons and modes oftransportation; surgery; architecture; and gold, silver, and all othermetals.

A simple way of relieving this pressure is to purchasetwo coconuts. Offer one to Obatala. Punch two holes through the\"eyes,\" allowing the liquid inside to drain into a glass or cup. Rubthis liquid firmly into your scalp, with particular emphasis on thecrown of your head. Ask Obatala to bring you peace and tran-quillity while you are doing this. Leave the liquid on your hair forseveral hours or overnight.

He is the essence of purity,justice, and clear thinking. In one sense he is the mostrational, most linear of the orisa. He also represents thepure and calm way to transcendence.In Ifa mythology, Obatala is probably known as much for his weak-nesses as for his strengths. With all the orisa, enormous strengths arebalanced by equally powerful potential weaknesses. Though Obatala'sclarity is essential to his accumulation of wisdom and his dispensingof justice, the clouding or distortion of this clarity can have disastrousresults. One of the classic myths in Ifa has to do with Obatala's \"fallfrom grace.\"OThough only Oludumare could give life to human beings, it was oneof Obatala's tasks to mold from clay the human figures. After a suit-able number were molded, Oludumare would appear and breathe lifeinto them. One day Obatala overindulged in palm wine and while in-toxicated proceeded to ineptly and carelessly mold a group of thesehuman figures. Some of the figures were missing arms, others legs,and those with all their appendages intact still showed imperfectionssomewhere. Because of his trust in Obatala's sense of duty, attentionto detail, and personal integrity, Oludumare did not examine the fig-ures when he paused to breathe life into them. From that moment intime, and from Obatala's transgression, come all the dwarves, hunch-backs, cripples, and other deformed persons. And, from that time on,because of the incredible remorse Obatala felt, they became his omoorisa, his children, and are sacred to him.95"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Pregnant women will be heard to say, Korisa yana ire lo nio! or\"May Obatala create for us a good work of art.\"For those who, like myself, find this orisa of white energy to be theirpersonal guardian, it is essential that this tale be taken seriously. Irecognize that we in the West grow up thinking that everything spiri-tual is a parable or allegory of our everyday lives, but the qualities ofthe orisa of Ifa are not allegorical. They are our specific and detailedinstructions for tapping into and using our nonlinear energy. So, justas Obatala's positive attributes can geometrically increase our poten-tial and accomplishments, so too can his weaknesses lead to our ownemotional or physical failure. In relation to the palm wine tale, it is in-variably true that the children of Obatala must be careful regardingoverindulgence or substance abuse. Obatala himself was warned ofthis when he descended to Earth.In the sacred text of Ifa, Odu Otura-tutu reads,Palm oil separately, white cloth separately, was divined for Obatalawhen he was coming from Heaven to be enthroned in the world. He wastold to sacrifice: white wrapping cloth, snail, and 20,000 cowries. Hewas advised not to drink palm wine at all. He obeyed but sacrificed onlyhalfway. He was told to clothe himself in white cloth. \"White cloth is thedress of the orisa.\" He was told to wear it into the world. He was wearingwhite cloth but did not heed the palm oil warning. He got drunk, andpalm oil splashed and stained his clothes. He then sacrificed a snail andat last vowed never to drink these wines in shame.One of the reasons Obatala's children have so much trouble withalcohol and drugs is that they are the most linear of the nonlinearorisa. Though children of Ogun, Osun, Yemonja, Sango, and Oya havealmost instantaneous call on virtually unlimited emotional energy,Obatala's energy is derived from clarity and peace. In our scientificand technological world there is little time for introspection, calmness,clarity, and peace. We are continually rushing off to something.For the children of many of the orisa, this constant activity andpressure does not interfere with their ability to access and remainstrong from their other sources of energy. For Obatalas, the persis-tence of such conditions over a long period of time cuts them off fromthe energy they need to remain productive, stable, and emotionally96THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"balanced. As the rush becomes greater and the pressures mount, theneed for nonlinear sources of energy becomes more and more desper-ate—and less and less accessible. Under these conditions children ofObatala who are unaware of how to tap into orisa energy will instinc-tively look for ways to mute or dull the constant input. They may betempted by drugs and alcohol as ways of achieving that peace, butthese means will always be ultimately destructive. If you are a child ofObatala, you should take this warning quite seriously.Similarly, though the children of Esu, Oya, Osun, and Sango canparty all day and night, those who are guided by Obatala simply can'thandle it. If they attempt to, it will erode their ability to accomplishthe tasks for which they are uniquely qualified. Even large groupstend to \"frazzle\" Obatalas. Though they can certainly deal with the so-cial milieu and even thrive in it for short periods, the children ofObatala must know when to back off and seek some time alone, somecontemplative time.Obatala controls the head. For that reason the children of Obatalamust be careful about their heads in both practical and spiritual mat-ters. When the head is \"safe\" it will provide the strengths of reason,planning, clarity, humility, and ethical understanding. When it is\"hot\" it will confuse, alarm, and disrupt one's everyday life. In order toachieve a healthy state it is again essential that those who are guidedby Obatala construct a life that includes rest and quiet periods forbeing alone.Obatalas are most comfortable in the woods or mountains andshould plan their vacations there because their primary energy con-nections can best be replenished from these sources in nature. Per-haps another reason why his children enjoy the woods, hills, andmountains is that they need to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.In nature, Obatala is symbolized by the chameleon, gorilla, and ele-phant. The elephant possesses many of Obatala's characteristics. It islong lived, as should be the children of the white orisa; it has enor-mous power but uses it judiciously rather than capriciously, and itsuccessfully lives a life unbothered by other animals. The gorilla is oneof the most intelligent of animals, lives on the mountainside, and isbasically shy. The chameleon lives on low branches in the forest andOBATALA 97"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"has a special affinity for Obatala. The chameleon's survival and de-fense is based on cunning and stealth, and its ability to change colorand avoid capture is likened to Obatala's wisdom for accomplishingthe same thing.The land snail, or igbin, also has a special affinity for Obatala. Oneof the oldest life forms on the mountain, its cool secretions and bloodare powerful medicines for cooling and treating one's head. As childrenof Obatala must guard against loss of sight, head injuries, and cerebralaccidents, the medicinal value of the land snail's soothing secretionscannot be overestimated. The igbin has great importance throughoutthe mythology of Ifa.Obatala uses no magic. He prefers to use reason and wisdom to ac-complish his goals. But if one is too intransigent or refuses to \"see thelight,\" Obatala's companion Esu steps in and punishes for him.Obatala is also the judge. He was chosen by Oludumare to make theright decisions. Some people have assumed that this aspect is simplyan extension of his role as \"king of the orisa.\" In actuality, it is his cool-ness of thought that caused Oludumare to appoint him administratorof justice. This ability to make cool, rational decisions is a primary at-tribute of Obatala. Its down side is that Obatalas tend to \"administer\"justice on a continual basis! Often the children of Obatala will not rec-ognize that they are constantly passing judgment. Frankly, it justdoesn't occur to them that you might not want to hear that there is a\"better\" route to the store or a more efficient method for accomplishingyour task. Making it even more annoying is that they are almost in-variably correct! What Obatalas must come to grips with and learn torecognize—if they are to use their strengths in a productive fashion—is that everyone need not always do things in the most efficient man-ner. Indeed, for the children of most other orisa, pressure to find themost efficient way of doing something would just detract from theirenjoyment of it. Obatalas must learn that, for others, most efficient isnot necessarily best.Obatala's stomach is as delicate as his head. Though the warriororisa will delight in hot peppers, cayenne, and spices of every kind,Obatala will make his life vastly more comfortable by eating blandlyand sensibly. Milk, honey, rice, yam, or breads are often offered to the98THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"shrines of Obatala, along with coconuts, bananas, and fresh fruits. Hischildren would do well to adhere to a milder and more reasoned diet aswell.All this is in no way meant to imply that Obatala or his children arein any way effete; Obatala possesses and dispenses great strength. Itis simply an acknowledgment that in his specificity as an orisa—andall orisa are different—his strength is derived and nurtured through amuch different process.Obatala has both male and female aspects. In one of his femalepaths he is known as Ochanla, an old and wise female. In others hehas a propensity toward shells or making money. In still others he isthe teacher or in charge of the head. Yet whatever particular path ofObatala you are destined to follow, the general characteristics will re-main the same.Despite Obatala's need for periods of quiet, his inherent judgmentalbehavior, and his need to avoid alcohol and drugs, he remains an orisawith a great sense of humor. Yet his humor, like all other aspects of hisexistence, is unique to him. His is the humor of having seen so much, ofhaving so much knowledge, such genuine understanding and empathyfor the human condition, that laughter becomes an extension of under-standing. Laughter replaces anger; tolerance replaces impetuosity.OBATALA99"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"SANGOOn'-ile ina! The Lord of the house of fire!A da ni niji One who causes sudden dread!Ina osan!

If you are able toobtain kola nuts at a local specialty store, be certain that youspecify bitter kola for your Sango sacrifice. Rooster and ram areblood offerings to Sango. It is often pleasant to light a candle atthe same time you make your offering. This candle can be anycolor (other than black), but a white candle is most commonlyused.

But in fact the gift of lightning was not origi-nally his; it was a skill he learned from his first wife, Oya. Indeed,Sango's path, both as man-orisa and later as orisa-man, is inextricablyintertwined with Oya.SIn the mythology that depicts Sango as the fourth ruler of Oyo, hewas married to the beautiful and powerful Oya. Sango was always aman of quick and vociferous temper, whose verbal rage transmutedinto the thunder for which he is known. It was Oya who provided himwith the magic medicine for the secret of producing both thunder andlightning. It was also the mystical Oya who advised him on the plot tomanipulate his two powerful generals, Gboonkaa and Timi, into mu-tual conflict.

He usedthis power to topple Sango and drive him from Oyo. Oya, Sango's loyalwife, followed him into exile.

When those who had been his fol-lowers heard of his fate and rushed to see his body, nobody was foundhanging there.

Perhaps more than withany other orisa, it applies to a wide spectrum of capabilities. Sango isthe general, the born leader. His fierceness is widely acknowledged,and most fear his wrath. He is known for his double-headed ax, whichhe wields in battle. But though best known as a warrior, Sango is, inreality, the quintessential strategist. His strategy sometimes goesawry, as in his earthly attempt to destroy his two powerful generals bypitting them against each other, but over the many years his knack forstrategy has become highly refined and almost unstoppable. Sango andhis children are simply born manipulators. And though they will go tobattle ferociously, they will do it only as a last resort. Sangos love noth-ing better than to plan ahead—to set the stage and pull the stringsnecessary to produce the results they desire. Sangos who are in touchwith their energy will get people to do exactly what they want butleave them with the impression that they made their own decisions.Manipulation can surely be used for good or evil, and, like all en-ergy, Sango's has a positive and negative side. Sangos using their en-ergy in a nonproductive manner can wreak havoc. Though history'sgreatest chess champions were undoubtedly omo Sango, so too wereits greatest con artists! Part of this is explained by Sango's great giftof gab. Children of Sango can be hypnotic speakers. The great politicalorators, from Mark Anthony to William Jennings Bryan, were almostcertainly omo Sango.Because of Sango's ability to solve problems, he and his childrenseem to be drawn to them. Omo Sango's lives seem to be more filledwith difficulties than most, but their problem-solving capacitiesquickly sweep their troubles away. And they are in constant demandSANGO105"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"to solve other people's problems as well. In fact, if omo Sango are notcareful, too much of their time and energy will be consumed withother people's troubles, leaving them insufficient time to travel theirown paths.Sango's powers of empathy and intuition cannot be overstated.Early oriki (little prayers and stories) suggest that at one time it wasSango who possessed the divination board and the secret of castingthe future. In these stories it is said that because of his inborn abilityto sense future events Sango felt no need to use the physical equip-ment and techniques and so traded them to Orunmila in exchange forthe gift of dancing.Feats of the supernatural are commonplace to Sango and his chil-dren. They also seem to have a natural affinity for and regular contactwith the dead. Many of Sango's supernatural abilities come forth dur-ing his display of p'idon, or magic, at his annual festival. The headSango priest, or eleeegun, assisted by other initiates, enters a tranceand proceeds to perform a series of acts that have been done preciselyin this way since the beginning of time. These include placing fire ontheir heads, holding it in their mouths, and then spitting it forth in areflection of the lightning that is his counterpart in nature. Often thepriest's abdomen is pierced with a slender knife, his tongue piercedwith an iron nail, and perhaps most impressive, his eyeball removed,cut off, and then replaced in its socket. It is critical to understand thatthese feats are not sleight-of-hand or trickery; they are psychokineti-cally controlled actions while in trance by the highest level of Sangopriest. They are dynamic substantiations of the powerful and violentenergy that is Sango.Sango's children communicate with their guardian by shaking asmall gourd, or sere. This communication became possible when Sere,a gourd native to western Nigeria, found that she had no one to serve.Her sister gourd, Igba, was serving Oya, and her other sister, Akingbe,was serving Odo. Sere sought the services of a babalawo to help her.Her odu was Ose Meji. The babalawo instructed Sere on a certainherbal preparation that contained, among other ingredients, beansand seeds of various plants. She was told to prepare the ebo and toeat it. Immediately after eating it she was to go to the nearest Sango106THE WAYOFTHE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"shrine and pray to the orisa. Sere followed the instructions and, uponeating the sacred medicine, went immediately to the nearest Sangoshrine, where she threw herself on the ground shouting the praisesof Sango. As she threw herself before the shrine, the nuts and seedsshe had consumed made a strange rattling sound in her stomach.Sango heard this strange noise and was delighted with it. Sangocalled out,There is no other in my kingdom like you.I will dance through my realm.You, Sere, will always proceed me,you will call them with your unique sound,you will say, Sakasiki, Sikasaka, Sikasiki, Sakasaka!Afterward, wherever Sango went in his kingdom, he was precededby Sere. When his followers heard her strange sound they wouldknow Sango was about to appear. Sere, in her gratitude to odu OseMeji that he had allowed her, too, to find service, included Ose's namein her call. Her sound became Osesakasiki, Osesikisaka, Ose, Ose,Ose.Today, when Sango's followers wish to call upon their orisa, theypick up Sere and shake her until the sound of Osesakasiki, Osesik-isaka, transcends the moment and calls forth the potent energy ofSango.The ram is symbolic of Sango, and its horns are used for his altar. Theram is also the primary blood sacrifice for appeasing or invoking inter-vention by this powerful orisa. Yet the association of Sango with theram offers great insight into genuine Sango energy. The ram is quickand determined, yet it does not have the teeth or claws of a carnivore,which are designed to maim and kill. It may give a nasty butt to thosewho offend it, but it does not seek to kill or destroy.The snake is regarded as Sango's messenger. Its lightning-shapedbody corresponds with Sango's most visible physical manifestation. Thecrocodile is also closely associated with Sango because the loud crackingof its reptilian eggs is akin to the thunder that accompanies Sango'sSANGO107"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"fiery bolts. The ax, both single- and double-headed, is the constant com-panion of this warrior orisa. The single-headed ax, known as ake Sango,is much rarer than the double-headed ax, or oshe Sango, that he is nor-mally seen carrying. As important as his axes are the thunderstones orcelts that are invariably carried in small leather waist bags by Sangopriests. Children of Sango are well advised to carry this teardrop-shaped stone, which is said to be the residue from the thunderbolt thatSango casts from above. Many tales abound as to how Sango destroyshis enemies by hurling his bolts, and it is believed that each one that isdug up and found carries with it not only the mystical power of Sangobut the accumulated ase or energy of the vanquished enemy.Among Ifa devotees, any house or structure that is struck withlightning must be examined and cleansed by Sango priests before itcan be safely inhabited again. This process cannot be completed untilthe attending priest and his followers discover and remove the thun-derstone that remains from the carnage.But Sango is not only a potent force of destruction. He is a force forprocreation as well. He is to male fertility what Osun is to female con-ception. Sango is highly sexual and tends to have numerous satisfyingrelationships. His children, if in touch with their energy, will be highlysexual as well. Celibacy or long periods of abstinence from sexual ac-tivity would drain the Sango energy. Sango is also the male deity fortwins. When Sango took his wife, Osun, to his brass palace, she borehim twins. From that time on, Sango became the male orisa of multi-ple births. If you are a twin, your guardian orisa will be either Sangoor Osun.As children are the ultimate blessing of Ifa, the birth of twins is ob-viously a double blessing. For those who doubt the importance of orisaenergy in the conception of children in general, and the Sango andOsun energy in the birth of twins in particular, ponder for a momentthe fact that the Yoruba bear twins thirty times as often as the rest ofthe world!Sango energy carries with it the absence of ambivalence. WhatSango and his children will never encounter is a person or a groupwho feels neutrally toward them. Instead, the lives of omo Sango willbe filled with people who look up to and follow their every lead and108THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"with people who seem to have an inborn dislike for them. This dislikeis more than just casual; it more likely stems from some primevalevents in which Sango energy negatively affected several other energysources. For example, Sango has a long history of conflicts with Ogun,the taciturn warrior orisa of all metals. Not the least of these wasOgun's loss of Oya, his wife, to the more handsome and social Sango.Though relationships between children of the two orisa are possible,they will be based more on mutual fear than on respect.Although some orisa energies blend better than others, and someare more (or less) likely to get along, it is important to understandthat orisa energy is not only attracted to like energy but is often bestbalanced by an opposite energy. That is well demonstrated in themythic tale of Obatala and Sango.Obatala was planning a trip from his kingdom of Ife to visit Sango inthe neighboring kingdom of Oyo. He consulted with the Ifa oracle beforeundertaking the journey. Ifa informed Obatala that he could meet deathon the proposed journey. If he wished to avoid death he must be pre-pared to suffer a number of insults and indignities along the way, and heshould do so without complaint. So warned, Obatala began his journey.Time after time he was confronted by the mischievous Esu in a varietyof disguises. Each time Esu attempted to provoke Obatala into a conflictthrough insults and humiliations. Each time Obatala heeded the adviceof Orunmila and stoically continued on his journey.Finally, after an almost unbearable series of confrontations, he ar-rived in the kingdom of Oyo. The first thing he saw was Sango's horserunning wild after obviously escaping from confinement. He managed tocatch the runaway horse and was holding its reins when Sango's sol-diers arrived. They immediately took Obatala as the thief who hadstolen the horse and unceremoniously threw him into prison. Soon after-ward a series of calamities struck Sango's kingdom of Oyo: crops failed,people fought, children died, women could not conceive. Sango consultedwith Orunmila in order to save his kingdom. Ifa informed him that thecause of Oyo's trouble was an innocent old man who was being heldin jail. Sango himself hurried to the prison, where he recognized hisold friend Obatala and begged his forgiveness. The two reunited as oldand close friends, and Oyo once again prospered. Obatala had sufferedsilently as instructed by Ifa and avoided death.SANGO109"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"How can Obatala and Sango be such close friends with such oppo-site energies?

Remember thefirst nightmare that sent you fleeing into your mother's arms, and re-call the relief, peace, and safety you felt upon being enveloped by her.If you can remember and touch these emotions, you will be close toconnecting with the Yemonja part of your character.In the New World syncretization of Ifa into Santeria, Candomble,and related traditions, Yemonja/Olukun has been split into two enti-ties: Yemonja and Olukun. There is great danger in separating thecharacteristics of the single Yemonja/Olukun; quite simply, each halfis incomplete.

It is only when you incorporate Olukun energy thatyou are able to feel the full range of your powers. The reverse would beequally true. Joan of Arc was probably dominated by Olukun.In her female aspect Yemonja/Olukun is given credit for the birth ofSango, orisa of thunder and lightning; Ogun, owner of all metals andinstruments made from metal; Oya, the marketplace and tornado; andOsun, sweet water, love, and wealth. Motherhood is, therefore, an ex-ceptionally important facet of the major orisa.Though Yemonja/Olukun is indeed the quintessential mother, she isnot specifically in charge of the act of conception. That particularpower is left to her daughter Osun. Once the conception has takenplace and the pregnancy has been completed, Osun's work is done, andYemonja/Olukun often takes over. Indeed, a long-standing Yoruba taleexplains how Osun loves to conceive and have children but quicklytires of the responsibility of raising them. She therefore hands herchildren over to Yemonja/Olukun to be raised so she can go on abouther own pleasures. In the orisa view of the universe this is neither\"bad\" nor \"good,\" neither irresponsible nor responsible. It is simplythe way things are, and it acknowledges that Osun's energy wouldYEMONJA/OLUKUN117"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"ultimately be diminished by the twenty-four-hour-a-day nurturing ofchildren. Yemonja/Olukun, however, would be sustained and enrichedby the very same acts.In Africa, Yemonja is represented by the Ogun River rather than bythe ocean as she is in the New World. Olukun has come to reflect thebottom or mysterious part of the ocean. To understand as much of theOlukun energy as possible, visualize the utter stillness and depth ofthe ocean bottom. Here, separated from the rest of the world's soundand light, is the domicile of Olukun. It is here that secrets are pre-served and kept, that the unknown is knowable, and that riches andtreasures of the world abound. If you can envision the enormous pres-sure, the utter silence, the total darkness of this realm miles andmiles beneath the ocean's surface, you can glimpse—however briefly—the ice-cold power and strength of the Olukun energy. It is only sensi-ble that Yemonja, the quintessential mother, the absolute care giverand nurturer, the selfless protector, would herself be balanced and pro-tected by an implacable and mysterious balancing force. It is when thecomponents are dealt with separately that one faces genuine danger.In the New World, babalawos who treat the Olukun energy as aseparate orisa have begun to refuse to use the traditional ocean cere-mony to initiate devotees into the mysteries of Olukun. The tradi-tional ceremony takes place in a small boat, from which close contactwith the orisa can be made. But in a series of apparently unexplain-able accidents, many New World babalawos met their deaths bydrowning while conducting these ceremonies. The disasters became socommon that more and more of them refused to venture forth into thesea with their new initiates and now perform the initiations only onland. The African babalawo would sadly shake his head at their mis-takes. He would see that by choosing to deal only with the cold, im-placable Olukun energy, without the balancing force of the nurturingYemonja energy, the unknowing babalawo were stepping into an en-ergy vortex for which there was no controlling or mediating force. Byinvoking only the Olukun aspect of Yemonja/Olukun energy, the NewWorld babalawos were unleashing uncontrollable and devastatingpowers that often quite literally swept them away.Yemonja/Olukun, like her daughters Osun and Oya, carries the se-cret and promise of riches. The treasures that exist beneath the wa-118THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"ters were literally the currency of ancient times. The cowrie shell andthe other shells used as currency came from the rivers and oceans.Tale after tale informs the initiate of the potential wealth and richesthat can be obtained by \"proper\" dealings with the water orisa. A fa-mous tale involves Orunmila, who, during a time when the waterorisa were said to be angry with men, was informed in a dream to goto the ocean's shore and offer sacrifice. Others had been afraid to ap-proach the awesome, angry ocean energy, but Orunmila did as in-structed. After he offered the sacrifice, a huge wind began to whip theocean into mountainous waves. Suddenly one wave, so huge that itblotted out the sky and sun, rose directly in front of Orunmila. He wasafraid that he would be swept away to his death by it. Instead ofsweeping him away, however, the wave hovered directly over his headand then seemed to settle gently to the shore at his feet. As the waterreceded back into the ocean, Orunmila looked down to see mounds ofpearls and precious stones left by the water. Once again, the orisa hadbeen appeased and humankind had been rewarded.Both aspects of Yemonja/Olukun can be seen through this tale. Theawesome power of the tidal wave, hurricane, or typhoon, all of whichcan sweep away human lives and works, is balanced by the caring andrichness that the waters of the earth provide. Certainly without themwe could not exist. So the lashing fury of the ocean storm is balancedby the gently undulating waves that rock us much as a mother rocksher baby.Witchcraft is also associated with this water orisa, and thoughYemonja/Olukun has the capacity for it, it is her daughters Osun andOya who are the practical and feared practitioners of the art. PerhapsYemonja/Olukun's own awesome power makes the use of witchcraftunnecessary. This power was once put to the test by Obatala whenthe Olukun aspect challenged Obatala for supremacy. Olukun issueda challenge to see which orisa could be more spectacularly adorned;the winner would rise above the other in the orisa hierarchy. Obatala,using his wisdom, sent the chameleon to represent him in the contest.When Olukun arose from the ocean, adorned with the finest jewels,the most incredibly beautiful garments made from the plants andseaweeds, the most unbelievable pearled shawl, he was shocked tolook and see the chameleon dressed just as well. Diving back to theYEMONJA/OLUKUN119"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"depths, Olukun constructed an even more glorious costume andswept upward to the surface. Once again, as he glanced across thewaters, he saw the chameleon dressed as well as he. Time after timethis continued, until finally Olukun was forced to concede that hecould not outdo Obatala. And, this being the case, Obatala main-tained higher rank than Olukun.This myth carries with it the secret to dealing with the awesomeenergy of Yemonja/Olukun. You must approach it with love, respect,and intelligence if you are not to be swept away in the whirlpool ofpure energy.The priests or priestesses and children, or omo, of Yemonja/Olukunare among the kindest and most easygoing of all the orisa energy.Their nurturing, female qualities can indeed be pictured as the sur-face waters of the ocean and rivers. The powerful Olukun energy liesin the bottom depths and will rise to the surface only after much dis-turbance or interference. It will take a great deal to anger or infuriatea child of Yemonja/Olukun. They will, by nature, be forgiving and un-derstanding.In relationships, the children of this orisa can usually balance anddo quite well with the more turbulent energy of Oya, Osun, Ogun, andSango. Female olorisa (children) will be family oriented and enjoy thetasks of raising children and creating a stable home environment.Male olorisa will be excellent fathers, good and concerned providers,and caring husbands. Both will be less likely to be enticed by other en-ergy sources than the children of other orisa. When matched togetherthey may be considered \"dull\" by some standards, but according to theideals and energy that motivate them they will be happy and fulfilled.But this very tranquillity and calm, when pushed to its limits, willnot only disappear, it will explode into a wrath seldom equalled by themore obviously volatile orisa. You can push quite far before an omoYemonja/Olukun's anger is unleashed. Should you threaten their chil-dren or spouse or the stability of their homes, however, that destruc-tive energy will rise quickly to the surface and sweep the threat away.It is not a mistake to equate the Yemonja/Olukun anger with the forceof the hurricane, tidal wave, or typhoon. Each sweeps away every-thing that stands in its path. Once the destructiveness has passed, the120THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"undulating waves belie the act of hours before, but the devastation isno less real. Though Yemonja/Olukun will readily forgive after theyhave expressed their anger, they will often leave nothing to forgive.In Africa, the children of Yemonja/Olukun wear necklaces of crystal-clear beads and often carry fans sacred to their cult. Seven is the num-ber most often associated with Yemonja/Olukun. Her vessels containsacred rocks from her depths, which have been ritually consecrated toher and are usually filled with water.In Brazil, Yemonja/Olukun is virtually the national deity. Eachyear, on January 1, tens of thousands of Brazilians go to the shore ofthe ocean and place beautiful cakes, fruits, and candies on small hand-made boats, which are floated out as an offering to their patron orisa.At midnight these same olorisa will, with their backs turned towardthe ocean, jump over seven incoming waves as a ritual for health andprosperity for the coming year.In Yemonja/Olukun, Yemonja represents the \"feminine\" component,Olukun the \"masculine.\" Not a contradiction, this is an affirmation ofthe Yoruba view of the universe, where all things contain both maleand female energy. When the babalawo divines with either the ikin orthe opele, he is always looking at two distinct components. The rightside of the odu represents the male energy; the left represents the fe-male. It is the relationship between the two that goes a long way to-ward determining exactly what is happening in a client's life. As wehave seen above, separating them can have disastrous results andprovides a graphic example of what happens when we try to separatethe male and female forces within us all.YEMONJA/OLUKUN121"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"IIIIIIIIIIIIIIOYAEesin gbona Vewe tutu I'egbo li o Eesin gbona l'ewe tutu l'egbodifa fun Marunlelogojo igi oko,divined for 165 trees.

In onesense, this is because a mysterious quality is essential to her energy.In another, it is because when Oya energy impacts our daily lives, itdoes so with such abruptness and ferocity that we would prefer toavoid the convergence rather than encourage it. Yet, for those who arechildren of Oya, or for those adept at tapping into her energy, the pos-sibilities are endless.To help understand the mysterious quality of Oya, it is importantto recall her relationship with Sango. As his wife, she was truly thepower behind the throne, and her \"suggestions\" often propelled Sangoin the directions Oya felt appropriate. Perhaps some of the animositythat Sango engendered among his followers resulted from this outsideinfluence. Ultimately, at the urging of Oya, Sango pitted his two rivalgenerals against each other in the hope that they would destroy eachother. When one survived, he drove Sango and Oya from their king-dom into exile. It was during this exodus that Sango, filled with con-trition, hanged himself from a tree limb, transcended the humancondition, and ascended to orisa. It was then that Oya attempted todrown herself in the Niger River out of her own sorrow and pain. Shetoo transcended the human condition and rose to orisa.125"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Shrine figure of Oya from palace in Oshogbo, Nigeria, 1950.116THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Her desire to guide or manipulate Sango from behind the scenes isa microcosm of the mystery in the energy of this powerful orisa. Herrelationship with Sango was formative in a number of ways. The NewWorld tale of Oya \"stealing\" the secret of lightning and thunder fromSango when he was carousing with Osun belittles the power of this fe-male warrior. Instead, just as Oya often led Sango in the directionsshe chose, so too she always possessed the power that enabled Sangoto direct his bolts of destructive energy at their targets. In this waythe two powerful orisa worked together—Oya setting the course andSango delivering the blows. Thousands of years after Sango and Oyawalked the earth, modern science, in an attempt to understand andprotect our environment, has discovered that a microsecond beforelightning occurs, a minute electrical particle is emitted that descendsto Earth. The lightning that strikes a nanosecond later follows theexact path of this energy particle! In its attempt to avoid the destruc-tiveness of thunder and lightning, the energy of these two orisa, sci-ence has actually confirmed their existence and specific roles. Thatminute electrical energy that precedes the lightning is Oya, once moredetermining the path that Sango shall follow.More than anything, Oya represents the energy of sudden change.Her role as orisa of the marketplace is a practical example of thisforce. The marketplace represents commerce and trade, profits andlosses. How quickly money can change hands, how suddenly good luckcan produce fortunes and bad luck can dissipate them! The poor be-come rich, and the rich become poor. In this constant ebb and flow, thisshifting current of fortune, Oya is the predominant and guiding force.Offerings to Oya are most often made at a shrine in the marketplace,and no Ifa devotee would ever think of starting a new business or be-ginning his or her business week without propitiating this orisa ofchange.Oya, in her role as the tornado, exemplifies still another aspect ofher energy of sudden change. The tornado's selective destructivenessis part of its fascination. Riding low in the storm-laden sky, she willsuddenly dip and leave absolute waste where something apparentlysolid and substantial stood just moments before. Within inches of de-stroying the next home or building in her path, she will suddenly zoomOYA 127"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"upward, leaving the potential victim totally untouched. Though herdestruction may seem random, it is not. Oya's wrath is always pre-cisely exercised, and what appears random is not. Her destructive-ness, as stated above, is selective. The tornado, like the marketplace,produces sudden change, sudden shifting of fortunes. It is this abilityto almost instantly reverse fortunes that brings most Ifa devotees toask that Oya spare rather than reward them.No change is more profound than death. Though Icu, the orisa ofdeath, remains firmly in charge of taking people when their time hascome, it is Oya who is gatekeeper to the cemetery. It is totally consis-tent that this orisa of sudden change should be in charge of openingthe gate between the marketplace and our home—between Earth andHeaven. Oya is completely comfortable with the dead. In her perva-sive use of witchcraft (at which she is expert), her relationship withthe dead plays an important role. One of the classic Oya/Sango talesillustrates this point:Oya, who had left her original husband, Ogun, for the affections ofSango, discovered that Sango had become enamored with orisa Osun.This captivating goddess of love and sensuality was using her magicalcharms to lure Sango away from Oya. Oya was furious. She had con-fronted Sango with her knowledge, but he had denied everything. Fi-nally, she took matters into her own hands. Using her powers with thedead, and understanding Sango's revulsion for them, Oya summonedforth a cadre of the dead to surround the ile (house) of Sango and keephim prisoner. Now it was Sango's turn to be angry.\"Oya,\" he screamed, \"you cannot hold me prisoner in my own home. Ihave tasks in my kingdom; my subjects need me; you must call off yourminions.\"\"The only task you are looking to perform,\" replied Oya, \"is one withthat hussy Osun! No, my husband, you will remain in your home untilher charms have worn off.\"And with that, Oya strode haughtily away.Osun, hearing of her lover's confinement, waited until Oya left for themarketplace and slipped by the dead guards into Sango's ile. Once there,she dressed Sango in women's attire and went out to distract the guards.So great are Osun's charms that even the dead are not immune to them,128THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"and while they were flirting with the orisa of sensuality, Sango slippedaway.When Oya returned from the marketplace and discovered that herhusband had escaped with Osun, she was beside herself. Sango, in hishaste, had made a tragic error; he had left behind his instruments of fireand thunder. In her anger Oya entered Sango's private sanctuary anddiscovered his magical gourd and mortar and pestle. Dipping her fingerinto the gourd she felt a pastelike substance. She brought the finger toher mouth and felt a searing heat. The shout that she emitted was al-most as shocking as the fire that accompanied it. The jagged flame oflightning that came from her mouth was Sango's secret of fire. The mor-tar and pestle yielded the secret of thunder, and now this already power-ful female warrior became even more powerful.Eventually, Sango and Oya reached a kind of mutual understanding.The great love they had once held for each other could no longer exist,but the two would work together in the casting of thunderbolts and thedestruction of enemies. The loss of love had been compensated for, inpart, by the acquisition of greater knowledge and power.From this tale comes another insight into orisa Oya. Her resentmentof men and her eternal dislike for Osun now make sense!It is said of Oya:A-su-jo ma ro.She causes a heavy dark cloud but brings no rain.It is important to understand the strength and determination of thefemale orisa of Ifa. Though a basically chauvinistic attitude has be-come part of nearly all religions and cultures, the male and femaleorisa of Ifa were separate but equal. It was, therefore, not a cowering,docile Oya who crept into Sango's sanctuary to seize the secret ofthunder and lightning; it was a fiercely proud, angry, and offendedwoman. It is this pride and anger that still prevail in the energy ofOya and her children.Oya carries a sword in each hand. They speak of her love of truthand honesty. It is these characteristics that she still shares with herfirst husband, Ogun, from whom she took instruments of war whenOYA129"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"she left him for Sango. Indeed, these instruments often adorn the omoOya in the form of necklaces or bracelets.Oya's children are identified by strings of dark red beads, and thenumber nine is most often associated with this proud orisa. Oya ispropitiated with female goats, and her devotees wear attire similar tothat of Sango priests. Their ritual dress consists of many layers ofkilts or often one stiff, leather, apronlike covering. Vests beaded withcowries speak of her control of the fortunes of men and often extendfrom chest to ankle. She is the mother of Egungun, or ancestor mask,and priests and priestesses of Oya often wear elaborate masks to con-ceal their identities.Oya shares thunderstones or celts with Sango, but hers are morerounded, not pointed or sharp as are Sango's. Often the omo Oya willwear these rounded thunderstones on chains around their necks.Some will also be placed at the sacred shrine of Oya. The igba gourd isshaken to communicate with Oya, and its sound replicates the stormand wind.Another aspect of Oya that requires understanding is her role as awarrior. Though all the female orisa of Ifa have powerful energysources, Oya, exclusive among her sisters, will enter battle side byside with the male orisa. In this aspect Oya is viewed as the beardedfemale warrior whose wrath and power sweep all injustice, deceit, anddishonesty from her path. That is why Oya is often called \"the womanwho grows a beard on account of war.\"Her unique ability to function equally with males in battle derivesfrom her possession of the tools of war, which she took from Ogun, andher knowledge of the secret of thunder and lightning, which shelearned from Sango. When these tools are combined with her sense ofoutrage and justice, warrior Oya is a feared and formidable opponent.What does all this mean to the children of Oya? First and foremost,omo Oya are volatile in nature. The energy of this orisa simply cannotbe suppressed for any significant length of time. When male or femaleOyas are angered, they will express it in dramatic and often tornadicstyle.Thus they are often called130THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Efufulele ti da gi l oke-l-oke.The rushing wind that tears down trees from the top.As children they will be difficult to control, insisting upon their owntastes and setting their own agendas. Their tantrums will spring full-blown from seemingly innocuous situations, and calming them will beharder than expected. In adults, however, this same energy can becaptivating and charming. Usually dark-complexioned, they possess acertain sensuality that often belies their outward appearance. Thissensuality tends to be somewhat restrained or self-composed, how-ever. It is almost as if the hurt felt by Oya over Sango's indiscretionswith Osun has permanently colored her view of relationships. For thisreason it will take extraordinarily persevering men or women to weardown the inherent skepticism of the Oya they love. In matters of loy-alty and dependability, no orisa can match Oya. Children of Oya, oncecommitted, will remain loyal unless deceived or lied to.Oya, because of her relationship with the dead, is one of the onlyorisa that likes and adorns herself with dark colors. Her children, aswell, are not adversely affected by wearing them. Purples, reds, ma-roons, even black are totally acceptable for the omo Oya; black wouldbe taboo for omo Obatalas and improper for other orisa. Generally, herchildren will have experienced contact with the dead. The children ofOya have such a strong connection with the dead that it would be rareto find one that has not had memorable dreams of the departed or atleast a sense that spirits are around.Her children will also be naturally adept at witchcraft or magic. Itis told how Osonyin, the orisa of herbs and magic, refused to share hisknowledge with the other orisa. Once again it was the courage of Oyathat restored balance. Finding that Osonyin had hidden a huge magi-cal gourd filled with his herbal secrets of magic at the top of a hugetree, she caused ferocious winds to blow, which in turn caused thegourd to fall and spill some of its contents on the forest floor. Eventhough Osonyin managed to gather up the majority of his treasures,each orisa managed to obtain a few of the herbal secrets for him- orherself. Though they must always pay homage to Osonyin, the orisaOYA131"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"know and appreciate that Oya made some of the secrets available tothem. Because of this, Oya has access to all their knowledge, and heruse of herbal magic is surpassed only by that of Osonyin himself.

Asowner of the marketplace she allows her children to tap into the posi-tive energy that makes commercial activities highly successful. OmoOya would do extremely well in any retail operation, in stock or com-modity speculation, or in marketing. Their energy would be dimin-ished by sitting behind a computer, teaching, or providing health careor medical care.

A political dispute caused many to flee and seek safetyelsewhere. They were led by the previous town's crown prince and Ifapriest, Owate. They initially settled into the town at Ipole. Suddenly,as if offended, the previously abundant springs of Ipole diverted theircurrents into underground channels, creating a severe drought. Owateconsulted Ifa, who informed him that greatness would be achieved byhis descendants if they could find the river that represented all livingwaters, including the now-dry springs at Ipole. It was during this sec-ond pilgrimage that they came upon the river orisa Osun. Realizingthat the abundant and pure waters of the river would provide themwith the basis for a secure community, they decided to build their newtown on the banks of the river itself.It was then that the peaceful waters of Osun grew stormy and vio-lent and the orisa herself rose from the river to inform the newcomersthat the groves on the banks of her shores were sacred to her. If thepeople would build their city on the hills above the river and keep hergroves sacred and unspoiled, Osun would guard and protect the city it-self. The settlers agreed, and the town of Oshogbo was founded.

During the Fulani jihad thatwiped out many traditional villages, Osun appeared in the form of acamp follower, dressed only in her natural charms, and presented thesoldiers with a tasty vegetable dish. This dish was highly laxative ineffect, and the subsequent distress of the Fulani fighting men weak-ened them sufficiently to halt their progress. In this weakened statethey were caught by the Ibadan armies and defeated. The city of Os-hogbo had been saved. The orisa had kept her promise.Osun, for all her beauty, sexuality, and wealth, arouses distrust inmany Western women. For Osun men, who reflect her energy, the pathis somewhat easier. In one sense, the very power of her movement forquintessential femininity could be seen as an impediment to the move-ment for women's equality. Not only is this not true, but (seriously)Osun would never give up her dominance and settle for equality! Osunis an energy force focused on the present and intimately connectedand comfortable with all sensual pleasures. If you were forced to givea one-word description of the energy quality of Osun and her children,it would be sensuous.Our mythology contains reference after reference to the beauty ofOsun, but beauty is often culturally or societally defined. The full bod-ies of Goya's nudes juxtaposed to the straight lines of Twiggy give us aperfect example of how notions or standards of beauty change. Herchildren can be short or tall, skinny or fat, young or old, fair or dark,but they will all have a tangible sensuality that often transcends thecurrent standard of beauty or attractiveness. Those in touch with thatenergy, regardless of their body style, carry themselves and behave ina manner befitting the sexiest movie stars. If you have ever been at aparty where an overweight man or woman, for example, acts as if heor she were the most handsome or beautiful creature there, walksabout exuding charm and the absolute confidence that you will besmitten by those charms, you have been in the presence of a child ofOsun totally in touch with his or her orisa energy. That energy, thatsensuality, is the core and essence of Osun and her children.OSUN159"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"This sensuality is not a casual or hedonistic energy. It helps Osunand her children accomplish the single most important task in the lifeof Ifa devotees: conceiving and bearing children. The magical momentof conception is made more probable when both participants reach fullsexual expression.Osun's sensuality epitomizes the powerful, sexual female that Ifaextols. It is through this transcendent sexuality that conception cantake place and our Ori called from heaven (see chapter 4) to share itsnext journey with the newly created fetus. In the philosophy of Ifa,children are the greatest single blessing that people can achieve.Though Osun is more than just a conceiver and deliverer of babies, itis this one aspect that places her in a position of prominence in thelives of her children and of all Ifa devotees. And though all orisa canhelp women who are having trouble conceiving, Osun more than anyother is capable of giving children to the childless.The sensuality of Osun also offers us an opportunity for transcen-dence, a chance to be open to the world of spiritual energy through or-gasm. During orgasm we experience pure feeling, and afterward weare better able to cope with our routine responsibilities. That, in greatmeasure, is what the world of spiritual energy is all about—it replen-ishes our energy.It might seem that, because of her obvious and overwhelming femi-ninity, Osun would have no male devotees. But that's not true. Thereare many male omo Osun. For all her abounding femininity, Osundoes carry a male energy component, who is known as Ikoodi Osun.He is the messenger of the male sexual energy necessary to completethe act of conception. Male omo Osun represent the same sexual andsensual intensity in male form that daughters of Osun represent in fe-male form.

It helps Osunand her children accomplish the single most important task in the lifeof Ifa devotees: conceiving and bearing children. The magical momentof conception is made more probable when both participants reach fullsexual expression.Osun's sensuality epitomizes the powerful, sexual female that Ifaextols. It is through this transcendent sexuality that conception cantake place and our Ori called from heaven (see chapter 4) to share itsnext journey with the newly created fetus. In the philosophy of Ifa,children are the greatest single blessing that people can achieve.Though Osun is more than just a conceiver and deliverer of babies, itis this one aspect that places her in a position of prominence in thelives of her children and of all Ifa devotees. And though all orisa canhelp women who are having trouble conceiving, Osun more than anyother is capable of giving children to the childless.The sensuality of Osun also offers us an opportunity for transcen-dence, a chance to be open to the world of spiritual energy through or-gasm. During orgasm we experience pure feeling, and afterward weare better able to cope with our routine responsibilities. That, in greatmeasure, is what the world of spiritual energy is all about—it replen-ishes our energy.It might seem that, because of her obvious and overwhelming femi-ninity, Osun would have no male devotees. But that's not true. Thereare many male omo Osun. For all her abounding femininity, Osundoes carry a male energy component, who is known as Ikoodi Osun.He is the messenger of the male sexual energy necessary to completethe act of conception.

Her children have much thesame trait. They are easily offended, and once genuinely injured, theywill cross you off their list forever.Osun both loves her children and provides them with the finest ofeverything: beautiful clothing, fine food, vintage wine, and colorfuljewelry. Their love of fine things has a certain down side as well. Osunmen and women must be careful not to overindulge, as extra weight orportliness is always a risk. Osun is intimately acquainted with and adept at witchcraft. Herchildren have an almost instinctive ability to work freely in this areaas well. Those in touch with their energy will find themselves drawntoward spells and ebos designed to strongly influence the behavior ofothers. With all the natural allure and sensuality of Osun, witchcraftseems almost superfluous.Those who cannot handle flirtatious behavior had better find amate other than an omo Osun. Though it is not imperative for Osunsto act out the flirtations, they do thrive on constant admiration and at-tention.In Ifa mythology Osun was originally married to Orunmila but wasattracted to and married Sango. In so doing she left Orunmila andtook Sango away from his original wife, Oya. It was said Sango builther a glorious brass palace where she bore him the blessing of twins.Since that time brass has been the special metal most associated withOsun. Her children should wear brass bracelets to help connect withher energy. In the same context, children of Osun will seldom getalong with children of Oya. In the visceral recesses of time, the injuryand hurt felt by Sango's loyal wife Oya at losing him to Osun has notdiminished or faded away. It is an undercurrent that almost invari-ably will strain any relationship between these two powerful orisa.Osun's heightened sense of life creates a number of idiosyncratictraits in her children. One of the most perplexing to me is what I callthe \"vote syndrome.\" Osun's children, perhaps because of their sensi-tivity about how other people view them, will invariably ask a host ofpeople their opinion about something the omo Osun is consideringdoing. They may ask four or five or twenty people the same question,\"What do you think about . . . ?\" After they have completed their poll,142THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"they will do whatever they want or feel is right regardless of the opin-ions the others expressed. Why then take the vote? Only Osun and herchildren can answer that question.Osuns favor bright colors, music, dance, and excitement. An omoOsun, tired from the everyday workplace, will find her energy replen-ished by going out and having a good time. While other orisa seekpeace or seclusion as a means of recharging, Osuns can play or danceinto the wee hours of the night and awaken refreshed the next morn-ing. For those living with or loving an Osun, understanding this is ex-tremely important. If you try and fetter Osuns you will not only draintheir energy, you will create a situation they will eventually leave.In the workplace as well, Osuns need excitement or, at the veryleast, people contact. To place an Osun in a cubicle running a com-puter for forty hours a week would be the equivalent of an emotionaldeath sentence. When Osuns do not understand this energy or at-tempt to exist in an inappropriate atmosphere, they become emotion-ally stressed and physically ill. The worlds of fashion, cosmetics,acting, photography, television, public relations, hairdressing, or mod-eling are environments in which omo Osun would thrive and grow.Children of Osun will love her waters and find themselves able tofill up with her inexhaustible energy by swimming, sailing, or evensoaking in a perfumed bath.In Africa her followers wear necklaces of brass beads and favor thecolor yellow. The peacock is symbolic of her beauty and bearing, andfive peacock feathers adorn the thrones of Osun. Mirrors and fans,along with shells and brass combs, are among the symbols that caterto and help connect her children with her. Fish are her divine messen-gers, and the catfish is of particular importance as an ebo or offering.It is believed that the tentacles on each side of the catfish mouth arecharged with energy similar to that of the orisa. Honey, both as a sym-bol for sexuality and for her appetite for it, is a regular offering toOsun. Her children will often go to the water's edge and slowly pourhoney into the lake or stream while asking Osun for the favor theyseek.Remember the classic tale of Osun and her sensuous dance to bringOgun back from the forest? Osun went to the edge of the forest whereOSUN 143"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"she knew Ogun was living. There she began her sensuous dance.Ogun, peering out of his hiding place, watched fascinated. Osun neverlooked his way, but continued her rhythmic dance until nightfall. Thenext day she returned and continued. Each day Ogun began to creepcloser and closer to this hypnotic creature. Always, Osun pretendednot to see him. Finally, when Ogun had crept within arm's length,Osun reached in and dipped her fingers in the honey pot she carriedon her waist. Turning quickly, she smeared the sweet substance overthe lips of the startled Ogun. Tasting the honey and hypnotized by thebeauty and allure of this sensual orisa, Ogun followed Osun back tocivilization where growth and building could resume.The foremost priestess is known as the Iya Osun and lives in aroyal palace in Oshogbo. She is the keeper of the most sacred mysticaltaboos of Osun and protectress of the original sacred shrine Ojubo Os-hogbo, the altar that founded the town. It is through her that Osunoften appears in human form. More than any other orisa, Osun isprone to adopting human forms to communicate with or bless her fol-lowers. The tale that recounts how Osun stopped the Muslim invasionby appearing as a camp follower is an example of this.Each year thousands of pilgrims go to her sacred groves in Oshogbo,Nigeria, and seek her blessings for children, love, and wealth. Eachyear many will personally experience Osun in her human aspect.144THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"ORIOri ki bum ko fe de ale, He ti iwa No matter how bad a person'snikan lo sow.destiny may be, there is anamendment; but the more diffi-cult to amend is an individual'scharacter.146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"FIFTEEN/////////// ORI —AJALAMOPIN—DESTINY147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"EBOS FOR ORI The most common offerings for your Oriinclude kola nuts, dry gin or other hot drinks, palm oil, whitepigeon, and all foods.

Through good character individualsmay be led to successful, knowledgeable people who will be preparedto guide and help them. Ritual and sacrifice can provide the sameresults. Using these two avenues may not make individuals with diffi-cult destinies rich or successful, but it will certainly make their livesmore comfortable.In the sacred Odu Owonrin-Meji, Ifa says,Agbon mi jia-jia ma jaa [name of an Ifa babalawo] cast a divinationoracle for Bayewo when she was told to perform rituals.

He, along with Esu, is the constant companion and assistantto the babalawo.Osonyin is one-legged like the trees and plants he represents. Inthe myths it is said that he lost his leg and acquired other physical in-firmities while in a struggle for power with Orunmila. His staff of of-fice is forged from iron and often contains leaflike extensions toppedwith a single bird. The staff, known as opa orere eleye kon, is carriedby the babalawo as indication both of his office and of his relationshipwith Osonyin, which allows for the transformational use of herbs. Thestaff, which contains a series of birds perched on the lower branchesas companions to the single bird on top, is an indication that this par-ticular path of Osonyin is obligated to the aje, or witches. This closeassociation comes from Osonyin's remarkable talent for controlling the159"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"destructive powers of fear and hysteria. Through his herbal applica-tions he can transform destructive and chaotic hysteria into creativity.Improper usage can produce the reverse effect.The babalawo or owner of the staff must be sure it does not falldown. It must never lie on the ground, because this would break itsconnection with the living force, or ase, of plants. Plants that fall ontheir sides are dead and have lost their energy. Though Osonyin isbound closely to the babalawo, there is no orisa that can perform taskswithout the help of this herbal orisa.The tale is told of how Oya, discovering the secret hiding place ofOsonyin's magical herbs, created a windstorm to topple their con-tainer from the immense heights of the Araba, or white silk cottontree, that it was hidden in. This tree, the tallest in Africa, has greatspiritual power and reaches heights of 120 feet or more. Osonyinheard the wind and tried to return in time, but many of the magicalherbs had spilled to the ground, and all the orisa helped themselves toas many as they could before Osonyin could once again gather histreasures together.Osonyin is owner of the forest and plants, and no other orisa can ef-fectively use his or her magical ase without permission from Osonyin.He is associated with the aje, or witches, because he is also intimatelyinvolved with the practitioners of black magic.Though Osonyin is intimately involved with the babalawo, priests ofOsonyin perform their own ancient form of divination. The Osonyinpriest joins with the magical qualities of agemo (chameleon). Herbalmedicines are combined with agemo, and one half is eaten by the priestand the other half placed inside a doll. In a trance state, the priestcommunicates with the doll, who answers in a high-pitched, childlikevoice. There is little attempt to conceal that the voice issuing from thedoll is a product of ventriloquism, but the essence of the process is thatthe priest is communicating with energies that not only provide thequestions but supply the solutions as well. The babalawo's staff, orOsun (not to be confused with the orisa of the same name), representshis pact with Osonyin to utilize the properties of herbs for magical pur-poses. The staff of the priest of Osonyin is similar in looks and purpose.160THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"ORISA OKOOko was first man, then orisa. He was said to have been the king ofIrawo. He was selected king after a highly undistinguished life thatconsisted mostly of roaming the land as brigand and part-time war-rior. His most extraordinary talent was as a hunter, particularly of theelusive guinea hens, or bush birds, of Africa. As king, his rule wastyrannical and self-indulgent. It was this self-indulgence that touchedoff the events that changed his life and ultimately turned him into anorisa.Returning from a journey, Oko found that his palace courtyard wasvirtually filled with wild yams from the harvest. In our tradition theyams cannot be eaten until the local priests have divined the neces-sary offerings and offered the requisite prayers. To partake of theyams before that takes place would be to violate a major taboo. Oko,self-centered as he was, was more consumed by his hunger from thejourney than by respect for the traditional taboos of his religion. Hebuilt a large fire and proceeded to roast as many yams as he couldpile upon the flames. Earth, incensed at his insensitivity, gave himthe dread disease leprosy.In ancient times lepers were offered two alternatives. They could beconfined at home, without human contact, until the disease provedfatal, or they could be exiled to the wilderness; in more modern timesthe choice became known as \"staying home\" or going to the \"farm.\"Yet, in Oko's day, the farm did not yet exist, as foodstuffs were huntedor gathered in the wild. Nevertheless, it is because of Oko's exile thatthe farm itself exists. When he was cast into exile in the wilderness,one of his devoted wives followed him. It was there, in their wildernessresidence, that his wife began to systematically plant and harvest cul-tivated fields, and it was there that farming was created. In Oko's self-indulgent way, he took and was given credit for his wife's brilliance.He was credited with the creation of the farm.Though character is a genuine issue for the Ifa devotee, pragmaticresults can often override short-term judgments. Oko's belligerent at-titude, his theft of the credit due his wife, and his self-absorption ledTHE ORISA OF MEDICINE, JUSTICE, FARMING, AND FEMALE POWER161"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"in turn to his violation of taboo, illness, exile, and finally the emer-gence of the \"farm\" as a great blessing to humanity.Today, the taboo for the newly harvested yam still exists. It lastsone lunar month. Yet, for the devotees of orisa Oko, it lasts longer. It isso strict that his followers will cover their eyes when passing piles ofnewly harvested yams. It is as if they must, by their acts of reverence,make up for the lack of reverence by the orisa they follow.Finally, a month or more after harvest, when the yams are piledhigh at the altar of orisa Oko, and several have been offered to the an-cestors, the ceremony and festival are allowed to begin. The gods eatfirst, humans second. Oko supervises it all.Orisa Oko was known to hunt with an enormous sword, and todayhis altars reflect this. His avatars are guinea hen, poisonous snakes,and scorpions. To violate the taboo today would still bring the wrath ofleprosy or death by bite or sting to the offender.It is orisa Oko's task, in addition to farming, to search out, give trialto, and execute witches. The aje, or witch, is the epitome of uncon-trolled forces, while the farm is the essence of controlled elements. Forthis reason Oko is firmly opposed to witches and spends a great deal oftime eradicating them from the land. The accused are placed on theorisa throne, and priests of Oko utter the prayers known only to theircult. If guilty, the accused die. If not, they are set free.ORISA OSOSIOsosi is the orisa of the hunt. His primary symbols, the bow andarrow, are representative of his multifaceted capabilities. Tragically,during the kidnapping of Africans for slave trade, entire villages de-voted to the worship of this orisa were uprooted and taken to the NewWorld for sale. As a result, this once-powerful and influential Africanorisa hardly exists on his native continent. In the New World, in thesyncretization of the religions Candomble, Santeria, Macumbe, andothers, Ososi still plays a major role.Ososi is both hunter and warrior. His ability to see great distances,hear the most minute sound, and act instantly give him the power and162THE WAY OF THE ORISA"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ability to kill with ease.

Ososi hasbeen known to carry out the judgments of Obatala, and his own men-tal clarity and alertness make for a strong pairing with the orisa ofpurity It is Ososi's relationship with Obatala, his carrying out ofObatala's sentences, that has led to the New World concept of Ososi asthe owner of jails and prisons. Quite often, in Cuban, Brazilian, orPuerto Rican homes you will hear, \"Ososi, please live in my home so Iwill not have to live in yours.\"One of the Ososi oriki tells how the hunter returned to his home tofind that two quail he had shot that morning had disappeared. WhatOsosi did not know was that his mother had visited his home and, see-ing the quail, had taken them to her house to prepare them for herson. Furious at what he assumed to be thievery, Ososi instructed hisarrow to find the culprit. He then shot his magical arrow into the air,and it flew to his mother's home and killed her. Later, when Ososi re-alized what he had done, his contrition elevated him from man toorisa, and he pledged to supply man with food from that day on. Ososialso has the capacity to use magic. His life in the forest acquaintedhim with herbs and their magical ase.ORISA OKEOke is a female orisa whose earthly form is rocks and boulders. Herprojections seem to defy the gravity that encumbers her fellow orisaand are most often seen jutting from the tops of hills or mountains.Even small stones and pebbles contain her ase, and a famous Yorubaoriki translates, \"The smallest stone sends forth great power.\" Indeed,this orisa in her igneous form is the essence of power.

The city isbuilt on a series of hills, and one is sacred to Oke, with an altar upon it.In Ibadan, during ceremonies to the orisa, she is greeted, \"Okebadonage, olomuoro,\" which translates, \"Bat's water cooler with huge breasts.\"Her chief priest, the Aboke, conducts her annual festival, where the Obaof Ibadan provides a cow, edible snails, beer, and yams for her devotees.ORISA NANA BUUKUNOne of the most mysterious, powerful, and feared orisa, Nana Buukunis the mother without children. Her cult is based primarily aroundmagic rather than mysticism. She rules prebirth femininity. Onlywomen are her devotees. In one sense she is the witch with terriblemagical powers, able to kill with a touch of her staff. In another aspectshe is the protective mother, the mother of all. Her title, Iya Gbogbo,translates \"Mother of Everything.\" The seeming contradiction—Mother of Everything, yet having no children of her own—resolvesinto her nannylike aspect, in which she cares for and nurtures thechildren and the home.Her priestesses are adept at extrasensory feats, including telepor-tation.

It never resumed.On Tuesday, we went to see the blood specialist for her results. Thistime Vassa, who had been improving steadily, sat alert in the waitingroom. After a long wait, we were ushered into the specialist's office,and after another twenty minutes the doctor appeared. After review-ing her chart for the results of the tests, he turned to us and said, \"Idon't know why you're here. Your tests are perfectly normal.\"At this point, I have a confession to make. My first reaction was,of course, relief. But my second reaction was typically Western. Ithought, Well, the original test must have been in error. Even though168 EPILOGUE"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the error was one that would have matched her medical problem ex-actly, it was still statistically possible. Then a thought flashed throughmy mind.\"What were the results of her liver profile?\" I asked the doctor.For over twenty years Vassa had suffered from chronic serum hep-atitis. Her liver condition was monitored every six months with bloodprofile studies, and though it had improved over the years, it was stillquite serious.\"Her liver profile is also perfectly normal,\" the doctor replied.Psychiatrists would undoubtedly say that Vassa's bleeding was aproduct of hysteria and that the sacrifices had simply allowed allthose emotions to disperse and the bleeding to end. But no matter howclinical you want to be, I can't believe that twenty years of chronicserum hepatitis could \"disappear\" overnight unless something veryprofound had occurred!The point here is more than that we reversed a potentially disas-trous medical condition; it is that we used all our alternatives toachieve our goal. We used both the linear and nonlinear that were atour disposal, the best of ritual and the best of science. In contrast tothe Christian Science couple who would use only one method of heal-ing—faith healing—Ifa understands that either-or approaches canlead to disaster. We are not, and cannot be, in a contest between faithand knowledge. We should, and must, be in a symbiotic relationshipwith both kinds of energy to solve our problems and improve ourlives.Ifa will never suggest that you choose between using ritual or ratio-nal skills to cure a disease, get a job, or find a mate. I teach, as Ifa hastaught me, that success, growth, happiness, and health come from in-tegrating both sides of your brain. If you're sick, see a doctor and useritual help for a cure; if you're applying for a job, you might use specialsubstances to influence the prospective employer but also prepareyourself for the interview and dress correctly; if you're romancingsomeone, you can use spiritual energy to achieve your goals, but you'dbetter be charming, considerate, and caring, too.

Let thosefoolish enough to be stuck in one area argue about credit.IFA AND DRUGSIn today's culture, one of the only routes left for achieving transcen-dence is through drugs. Those who partake call it \"getting high,\" I callit \"reaching for transcendence,\" but the bottom line is that drug use isone of the very few escape routes from societal limitations and pres-sures that most people are aware of. I believe that this is the reasondrugs are so popular. And I also believe that we will never solve the so-called drug problem until we understand this.We all have a basic, visceral need for spiritual experience. Therehave always been holy places to which people could go in search oftranscendence. Our churches and synagogues were established to fillthis function—to give us a place in which to integrate ourselves andbalance our psyches. But, with very few exceptions, they have losttheir soul. They have become forums for discussions of ethics andmorality. They are places to which people turn to find solutions to soci-etal rather than spiritual problems.I believe that our spiritual leaders have lost their way, opting to turnaway from the magic and mysticism that was their raison d'etre andsurrendering their empirical truths to the rational truths of Westernscience. The taking of communion, for instance, was not meant to bemerely symbolic; it was meant to be visceral, transcendent. Jesus said,\"This is my flesh; this is my blood.\" The ritual of eating horseradish onPassover was intended to make us feel the bitterness of oppression, notsimply remind us of our ancestors' pain. People turn to drugs becauserituals like these have lost their power—the power to make lasting,positive changes in our lives.As long as we insist on trying to \"reason\" people out of their thirstfor transcendence, we will fail. We must recognize that it is a cultureout of balance that drives people to drugs in the first place, that drug170 EPILOGUE"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"and alcohol abuse are symptoms of psyches begging for genuine highsand settling for chemical ones. Only by giving people a path to ahealthy, workable, spiritual system will we render drugs unnecessaryand superfluous. Ifa, through its ancient rituals—all of which havemaintained their transcendent power—gives us a way to integrate thematerial and spiritual so that the pleasure and satisfaction we getfrom them both is real and long-lasting.IFA AND CONCEPTIONIt was late fall when I received a call from Nora, a client who was con-cerned about her best friend, who had been trying to conceive for eigh-teen months. Her friend had consulted specialists in the field, andafter concluding there was nothing physically wrong, her doctors wereabout to start her on a series of hormone injections to see if she couldpossibly get pregnant. Nora wanted to know if there was anything Ifacould do.Having had friends whose wives had had the same problem, andhad subsequently suffered through incredible emotional peaks andvalleys from what turned out to be unsuccessful courses of treatment,I urged her to bring her friend in for a reading. I explained that if Ifacouldn't help her, which we would not know until I had divined for her,she could always opt for the hormone injections later. Several weekslater, she brought Jan to see me.Jan was thirty-one years old and had, for the last several years,managed office operations for a successful physician. Her grounding, ifnot her instincts, was totally linear. I remember thinking that her de-sire to have a child must have been terribly strong for her to haveovercome what must have been skepticism to seek out the babalawo inthe first place. But I also thought, \"There are no accidents\"; theremust be a reason she was here.Her reading was quite complex, but I could see that Osun couldhelp her. Osun, the orisa of sweet waters, controls love as well as theact of conception and delivery. In order to solicit her help, an intricateceremony would have to be performed. Divination had indicated whichEPILOGUE171"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"offerings and ritual we were to use. In Jan's case, obtaining Osun'shelp in conceiving a child would require blood sacrifice.I remember looking at her across my desk. I knew that Jan wantedto conceive a child with her husband more than anything. I felt herfear, her increasing feelings of inadequacy, and her overpowering sad-ness at what she viewed as her own personal failure. I also knew thatshe was typically Western, and that on this, her first visit to a baba-lawo, I was about to suggest a course of action that might be morefear-inducing, more upsetting, more difficult to accept than the realityof her current inability to conceive. And so, as gently as I could, Ibegan to describe the ceremony that was called for.Jan would come in old clothes, clothes that would, like her previousinability to conceive, be thrown away after the ceremony. My daugh-ter, a priestess of Osun, and my wife, a priestess of Obatala, wouldperform the ceremony under my supervision. The reason for this,quite simply, is that, despite the male ego, the act of conception andthe miracle of birth are the exclusive province of female energy. The\"loop\" that was to be connected between Jan and Osun could best andmost sensitively be accomplished by priestesses already intimatelyconnected to, and totally comfortable with, their nonlinear powers.After making prayers to Osun, Jan would lie on a mat where whitedoves and quail would be presented first to her and then to Osun. Janwould silently ask Osun to accept these offerings so that Osun wouldenable her to become pregnant. Jan would also thank each animal forthe sacrifice it was about to make in order that her baby could be con-ceived. The animals would then be passed over her abdomen beforebeing sacrificed to Osun. River water, representing the healing powersof Osun, would be rubbed into her abdomen while appropriate prayerswere being said. Honey, one of Osun's favorite foods and an avatar forsex and sweetness, would be applied as well. All would be mixed witha small amount of blood from the animals and, through the prayersand energy of the sacrifice, the loop would be made.Following this, Jan would be taken for a shower with African blacksoap and omiero, a liquid mixture of herbs sacred to the religion. Shewould then dress in new white clothing to reflect the \"rebirth\" of her172 EPILOGUE"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"spirit and physical capacity. Finally, an orange cloth she would bringwould be filled with some of the ingredients of the ceremony and wornaround her lower abdomen as often as possible.I told her that if she decided she wanted to go ahead, she should letme know so that we could schedule a time and place to perform theceremony. It took her a month to decide to go ahead, and about an-other month to make the preparations.Seven weeks after the ceremony Jan called me. She had just usedone of the early pregnancy tests and the results were positive! But,she said, the positive indication had been somewhat faint, and shewas afraid to get too excited. I was with another client when shecalled, so it was several hours before I could call her back. \"Jan,\" Isaid, \"you should have learned from the ceremony that what we aredealing with is positive energy. And for you to 'slide back' into fearputs negative energy into your womb. Right now there is a beautifulmicroscopic human being forming there, and it needs all the positiveenergy and joy you can give it! So instead of being afraid, feel the joy,feel the happiness, feel the relief that you've managed to get what youwant so badly, because when you feel it, so will your baby!\"A blood test several days later confirmed the pregnancy. Her sonwas born on September 21, 1991.Iboru, Oboye, Ibosise.Blessing asked for, blessing received.RELEASING NEGATIVE ENERGYIn 1975, my son Adam died. One moment he was alive and well. Thenext moment he was gone. He was nine weeks old.I remember receiving the terrified call from his mother. I rushed theseveral blocks back to our home in time to see the paramedics runningout our front door carrying what looked like a rag doll in their arms.I'm now convinced that at the moment I saw my son as a rag dollrather than my beloved child I clicked into my conditioned WesternEPILOGUE173"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"frame of mind—that \"ability\" to see things as component parts ratherthan the whole that they truly are. I could \"deal\" with my son's deathby intellectually separating it from the entirety of my life. I had suc-ceeded at compartmentalizing.And so, I took the devastating loss of my son and carefully placed itin one of the thousands of \"file drawers\" that comprise my psyche.While my response was to \"get on with my life,\" to \"put it behind me,\"I totally failed to even attempt to feel and to work through the griefand reach some sort of emotional equilibrium.We think that if we can put something away where we don't have todeal with it, it will go away. And by distancing the specificity of theevent from the rest of our lives, we can, as Descartes insisted, conquerthe part. What Descartes and the atomists who charted the economicand emotional paths of Western society failed to see was the impacton the whole of that kind of splitting.So we went on with our lives. We quickly sold our house and boughtanother so that we wouldn't have to deal with Adam's room and hismemories. We became involved in a host of stimulating activities—many not in our best interests. The fact that our lives had been alteredirreparably could not be changed, even if we managed to stay too busyto notice it.Today, as a babalawo of Ifa, I see clearly that negative energy can-not be \"put away.\" Indeed, it seems increasingly clear that as we fillour file drawers with more loss, pain, rejection, and fear, we sow theseeds of our own emotional or physical self-destruction. For, as sciencewould agree, energy cannot be destroyed. Even if we pretend it isn'tthere, even if we place it in the farthest recess of the deepest drawer, itstill exists. And that repressed negative energy will eventually makeitself known. Down the road, we will see the results of this negativeenergy as they emerge in the form of cancer, heart attacks, nervousbreakdowns, or high blood pressure. Doctors' waiting rooms, divorcecourts, and substance abuse clinics are filled with people whose \"filingcabinets\" are overflowing.As the years wore on, I \"understood\" that I had failed to deal with thedeath of my son. Believe me, I understood it... but I still didn't feel it.174EPILOGUE"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"In 1990, at age fifty, I became a father again.Through Ifa I had learned not to be afraid of my feelings. I hadlearned how to feel and use in a positive manner the energy these feel-ings provoke. This time, rather than being angry that my wife's bodywas growing larger and larger, I reveled in the miracle of our childgrowing inside her. I helped for twenty wonderful hours as Vassa copedwith the monumental process of giving birth, and I stood awestruck asthe head of our son Dashiel made its entrance into the world. The pure,exquisite energy of conceiving and giving life provided me with aninner strength and joy I had never before experienced.What does that have to do with dispersing negative energy? Well,not quite two months later, I was playing with Dashiel when suddenlya terrifying thought passed through my mind. It occurred to me that ifanything were to happen to this precious infant whom I loved sodearly, I would be totally destroyed. Even the thought caused a terri-ble, gut-wrenching pain and constriction of my chest. But this time Ididn't shove it away. I didn't file it away in a deep, dark drawer of mysubconscious. Instead I sat and felt the pain, for I had learned that thepain of potential loss was equal to the love I felt for my son. To sup-press the pain would diminish the love. At that moment, for the firsttime, I was able to feel the pain for Adam who had died fourteen yearsearlier.The laserlike emotional energy of pain and loss and love gave wayto tears that had waited fourteen years to be shed. As I held my new-born son to my chest, the tears for his brother ran down my face, andthe positive energy of the love I had failed to express released the neg-ative energy of loss I had refused to face. The file drawer emptied, andemotional equilibrium finally returned.Ifa is the study and use of energy. Through a defined set of ritualsand procedures, we learn first to experience, and then to use, energyto change our lives. Rather than suppressing or trying to modulate ourfeelings, we learn from Ifa that it is essential to feel totally. It is thesefeelings that ignite and allow the nonlinear side of the brain to per-form its powerful functions. Ifa also understands that only positive en-ergy can disperse or reach equilibrium with negative feelings.EPILOGUE 175"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"FEELING OUR FEELINGSIn our society we are afraid of intense feelings. We have been taughtthat certain kinds of behavior are appropriate and others are not. Menand women are assigned societal roles and expectations that blunttheir feelings and, eventually, blunt their ability to feel.In the past, our emotional and spiritual lives were nourishedthrough various rituals designed to keep the nonlinear sides of ourbrains open and active—communion, circumcision, the rituals ofEaster or Passover or Lent, keeping kosher. But as modern religiontraded its mysticism for humanism, we began to feel less and less andbecame more uncomfortable with profound feelings of any kind.Ifa, the world's oldest monotheistic religion, retains its originalmeans of transcendence. Through orisa worship, divination, and an-cestor worship we keep the nonlinear side of our brains open and pow-erful. When we pray to our orisa or to our ancestors, we connect topowerful energy sources. When we present offerings to our orisa or toour ancestors, or when we use divination, we bridge the gap betweenpast, present, and future in a palpable fashion. The profound energyand emotions released by these actions give us the power to improveour lives in tangible ways. They also give us the capacity to accept andexperience intense feelings in our everyday lives. Feelings, like theorisa, are energy. They must be experienced to be useful. Ifa teachesus how to feel.For years, in my role as a babalawo, I tried many methods of \"rea-soning\" to get people to feel safe with their emotions. I asked them topay attention to what they felt when witnessing a beautiful sunset,listening to an inspiring piece of music, or seeing a great painting. YetI would often meet up with the argument that what I was calling\"emotional\" responses were actually the products of learned values. Idon't really believe that, but I do recognize that people thoroughlytrained in a Western model can listen to Chopin's music and not feel it,or can admire Van Gogh's technique while blocking off the pain andpower that virtually leaps off his canvases. Actually, I believe thattruly linear art would be nothing more than very complex number176EPILOGUE"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"paintings and great linear music a cacophony of computer-driventones! Nevertheless, it became clear that what I needed was an exam-ple they couldn't argue with.I suggest that there is one moment in life when we are able to be to-tally tapped into the power of pure emotional energy. That is in theexperience of orgasm. Indeed, if we try to get linear about it, it won'thappen! Furthermore, after orgasm we feel relaxed, energized, andpeaceful. I guarantee you that if we expended the same amount of en-ergy carrying the groceries up three flights of stairs, we wouldn't feelenergized, peaceful, and relaxed!It's not simply because during orgasm we rub a nerve hard enoughto cause the brain to produce endorphins. If it were that simple, heroinaddicts would be the happiest people in the world! It's because for thatone moment, we totally and constructively exit the linear world andenter the world of pure emotional energy and power. And that world,unlike our everyday temporal one, gives back more energy than ittakes. Equally important, even though we momentarily \"lose control\"of the structures that we believe are totally responsible for our lives,the world does not come to an end. Indeed, after orgasm, our ability tocope with everyday events is usually stronger and more centered thanbefore. It only makes sense that there would be other means of tap-ping this energy, too.That's what Ifa is all about. It's a road map and instruction manualinto the exquisite power of the nonlinear, the nonrational. Throughritual and sacrifice, orisa worship and divination, ancestor worshipand prayer, Ifa provides a step-by-step guide for accessing this enor-mous source of power, peace, and strength.Through Ifa, you will be able to explore ritual ways of accessingthis power whenever you need it. At first you'll feel uneasy or perhapseven silly: \"You mean you expect me to take a watermelon and put itin the lake while talking in my head to someone called Yemonja?!\"But if, for only one or two seconds, you connect with the pure, power-ful energy of the ocean that we call Yemonja, this will be your firststep toward doubling or tripling your capacity to make lasting, posi-tive changes in your life.EPILOGUE 177"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"IFA AND THE BEAUTY MYTHWe are all trapped by a very limited concept of beauty. It is a fixationon the outward, on how things look, rather than how things are, andit's a kind of denial, a refusal to look inside. In that denial, we perpet-uate our own feelings of helplessness and despair. New cars, newwaistlines, new clothes, new partners, new hairstyles—all serve to de-flect us from examining what's underneath.Sometimes I am convinced that the orisa find us very funny. Thefoolishness of squeezing our feet into shoes that are too small andwearing jeans that are too tight would be so ridiculous as to precludeanger, but it would certainly encourage gales of good-hearted laughter.For us, it is not funny at all. We truly suffer from these standards ofbeauty and appearance, which carry with them a denial of the death ofour bodies in exchange for the guarantee of death to our souls! It isjust too heavy a burden. I see so many clients who have bought intothe nonsense; they're trying to find the right relationship, happiness,and personal fulfillment by changing the river's flow, by adhering to aset of values imposed by their culture.In orisa worship there is a natural order and transition to life andthe continua of death. Our Western fixation on appearances is simplyan attempt to stop the flow of the river or the rotation of the earth. Notonly can it not be done, it wastes our time and energy in the attempt—time and energy that could be used for growth.I urge you not to waste that time, not to deny yourself that joy. In-stead you should be laughing along with the orisa at our foolishness.IFA AND THE NEW AGEThere is an enormous difference between valid and valuable. Thereare many roads to truth, but you can travel only one at a time.We live in a fashion-conscious society It has become increasinglyfashionable in recent years to dip one's toe into the spiritual waters ofancient cultures. In the 1960s the fascination was with yoga, medita-178EPILOGUE"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"tion, and the mantras of India. In the seventies and a greater part ofthe eighties, the trend moved west, and people sought the curativepowers of the sweat lodge, the wisdom of Native Americans, onenesswith nature. And the decade of the nineties is projected to be the be-ginning of a renaissance of interest in Africa. We can expect cowriesand colorful beads to replace turquoise and silver.All these cultures have wonderful religious insights to offer, butnone can be meaningful to the spiritual dilettante! Transcendence wasnot designed as a cocktail party conversation enhancer. The art andartifacts of ancient cultures, expressing and reflecting their most pre-cious beliefs, were not created to adorn the walls of fashionable homes.Without exception, the meaning of these objects and experiences wasto be personal, inward, and transforming. Spiritual experiences weremeant to cater to the soul, not the repartee.Our culture, with its fixation on short-term gratification, conditionspeople toward a life lived on the surface. We have come to believe thatonly events that can be distilled into thirty-second news clips arenewsworthy. It is no wonder that we treat our religious experienceswith the same attitude. The cocktail party dilettante has become thespokesperson for the religious experience. And transcendence hasbeen denigrated from transformation to fashion.Though there is undoubtedly something profound to be gained fromany genuine spiritual journey, dabblers are predestined to miss it.They will flee just as they approach the real power and meaning of theexperience. Why? Because once you have tasted the beauty, serenity,and power of the spiritual, you will be forced to rethink and reshapeyour values. For many, that's much too frightening. It's something youmust feel and do . . . not just talk about.There are those who will say, \"There's truth in a lot of things; whyshouldn't we experience them all?\" The answer is practical, not philo-sophical. Every path has its own rules, its own truths and rituals. It isnot unlike learning to fly an airplane. You learn the rules that allowyou to fly safely to your destination. But if suddenly along the way youbecame fascinated with how helicopters fly instead and began to usethose instructions to fly your plane, there's a good chance you wouldEPILOGUE179"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"crash. It isn't a question of which one is right and which one wrong.It's simply that the instructions can't mix. There are many truths . . .one at a time.So dilettantes come to Ifa and the babalawo to be fixed ... in theshort term. They want to get the girl or the guy, win the court case, in-crease their income, or restore their health, but they don't want to re-think the values that caused their problems in the first place. Theywill participate in the rituals, make the offerings, and achieve somepractical results, but they will assiduously avoid the real opportuni-ties for personal growth. When the real meaning and transcendentpower of Ifa are made available to them, most cannot handle it. Insome sense they have been unwittingly supported in this short-termthinking by many of the spiritual, yet practical, solutions that havebeen offered to them.It is in this context that I draw the difference between something'sbeing valid and being valuable. It is absolutely true that one canachieve transcendence with Native American sweat lodges, the prac-tice of yoga, weekend religious retreats, t'ai chi, and so on. There arepossibilities for transcendence in the Western traditions as well. Com-munion, Passover, Easter, bar mitzvah, or baptism are all opportuni-ties for transcendence—but are they valuable? I would say that if thetranscendent experience fails to become part of your everyday life, if itcannot go home with you, its value is lost.As a culture we have come to accept that transcendence somehowdoes not apply to the everyday. We settle for the weekend experienceand then accept our return to the rat race as normal.That's where Ifa is valid and valuable. Ifa extols both the spiritualand the temporal. The orisa are with you always. You don't need achurch or structure to access them. They are with you in the country-side and on the crowded expressway or at a business lunch. They canhelp you achieve peace in one and success in the other. Ifa sees you aswhole and provides the ritual for keeping you that way; it cannot beunderstood or mastered in thirty seconds or thirty days. It is a lifelongjourney without destination or goal. It is the reason trees grow andflowers bloom: not to become the biggest tree or the prettiest flower,180 EPILOGUE"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"but to express their joy at the energy of the sun, their pleasure at thenourishment of the rain and the soil.
