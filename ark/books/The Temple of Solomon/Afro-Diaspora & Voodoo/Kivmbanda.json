In spite of drawing upon a variety of int1uences it was the rich soil ofBrazil that gave birth to this expression offormidable powers. These varieties of int1uences are ret1ected within the variety of ritual expression and understanding found from house to house dedicated to the worship of Exu and Pomba Gira, creating a rich heterodoxy or variation over a given theme. As such, the understanding of Kimbanda/Kiumbanda presented in this book is solely mine own and as such do not make claim to any provenance than what the spirit decided to reveal them selves, by the intervention of mundane men and what the spirits manifestations them selves, which opened the door to the kingdom of the Red Night. Kimbanda was coined as such in the 19208 with the establishing of U mbanda. 'fiKlay Kimbanda is largely understood to be the left side of Umbanda and much can be spoken in favor of such distinction and unity of opposition, both by religious logic resting upon a dualist theology and also by the linguistic root -both Kimbanda and Umbanda being linguistically of a \"kikongo\" origin. This gives an opening to the recognition of the African root of Kimbanda, largely based upon what are referred to as \"Congolese\" practices. With this means a modus of working that implies to meet the spirits head on, by use of trance states and a use of spirits reminiscent of the European use of familiar spirits amongst the witches of Europe. This proximity between the ways of the wise art in Africa and Europe and their consecutive meeting in Brazil either by slavery or exile created probably a somewhat nomadic spread and exchange ofknowledge and what we today know as Kimbanda was created by an interrelation of European and African int1uences. The European aspect has to some degree disappeared from the awareness of the practitioners, even if its memory lives on in the many songs or pontos cantados -as well as in the confessions given to the Holy Inquisition of Spain and Portugal in the 16,h Century. This constituted a great revelation for me and accordingly 1 asked for guidance in this matter and a rich material related to Pomba Gira and thus indirectly related to 9"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"European witchcraft found its way into this hook. In addition, my many years as a palero made it natural to use the tools of Palo Mayombe in addition to the various other traditional approaches in my working with these spirits, rather than adopting a Yoruha or Spiritualist approach to congress with these spirits I attempted over the years to find a format of working with these spirits that would be true to their origin and not their later developments. \\Vith this I mean, the direct meeting with spirits on their own accord and premises. It is my belief that there are a variety ofways of working with these spirits and aligning your self with them, they are a cultural conglomerate and this is evident in the richness found within these spirits. As such, what you will find within these pages is not and can not be the ultimate truth, but the way of working with Exu and Pomha Gira as seen from a journeyman on the Dragons road. It is simply one way of approach. A way I my self found useful and therefore in turn present to the Seeker in hope that it will bring some understanding of the nature and origin and ways of these wonderful and magnificent spirits. I must also add a warning. The powers of kimbanda and kiumbanda are real powers. It is the union of earth and fire and the spirits them selves possess a force and strength so massive that they can rnake the soul bleed and the astral anatomy be shaken into shreds and pieces in order to accomplish a solidification of mans true essence. It is accordingly not for the feebleminded or faint of heart, but a power of transformation that perhaps is one ofthe most majestic and intense powers one can encounter. If you chose to stray within their kingdom without a guide you do so on your own accord and the steps taken is your own responsibility. This book contains also spells and charms for malefica that arc highly effective in their ways of bringing harm. It can not be stressed enough that such workings always come with a price. So, if you feel tempted to execute any of the harmful workings, calculate the cost, keep your promise and be honest with your self in so far as your motivation for the act you arc about to commit. I take no responsibility for reckless and careless usc of any of the material presented in this book. It all is presented in order to provide an understanding of these spirits not to agitate the reader's lower soul and corrupted beast within rather the opposite is the truth. \\Vhere there is no control over the lower soul by the wise mediation of Nous, there will ever be progress and enlightenment -just decay and corruption. So, be warned as you journey within the pages of this kingdom that you are now on your own. Nicholaj Frisvold"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the To understand life we have many disciplines that can help us with the search, like philosophy, religious studies, anthropology, sociology, bur when it comes to understanding Death we arc perhaps better off if we turn to magic and the mystic. And more than anything in this field, occult philosophy and magical understanding, will be needed the tools. It is these tools we will apply in order to understand our field of study, Kiumbanda. To understand Kiumbanda first we need to understand Death. In the western world the awareness of Death is quite different than what we encounter in an African perspective, whether this is in the Congo speaking countries, Benin or :-.Jigeria. \\Vith Death we should in this context understand that we return to the source. Death is the beginning and prerequisite for Life. Life on earth is a condition of bounty but so is the return back. Grief comes naturally with Death, the sense ofloosing those we love and cherish. This change of shape and the change of all previous known modes of communication break down and we fed bewildered and lost in the world. The Dead arc experienced to be lost to us. We will try to demonstrate this is an illusion and through giving an account of the principles ruling Kiumbanda we will attempt to present an understanding of the condition of otherworldliness and also give suggestions of modes of contact with spirits of Death, as well as spirit beings. The origin of Kiumbanda or as it is more commonly spelled, Quimbanda and Kimbanda, will be discussed shortly. At this stage it is important to highlight that the Cult we know today as Kimbanda went through a tremendous transformation when it met Candomblc, the name given to the type of Orixa worship we find in Brazil. Candomblc in Brazil has epithets designing their ancestral origin connected to the term Candomblc. This means we find Candomblc Ketu, Candomblc Jcjc and Candomblc de Angola designating what area in Africa they claim descendancy from. It is in the Candomblc of Angola we will find interesting points of resonance related to the practice of Kiumbanda. Kiumbanda was brought by slaves from the areas of Congo and Angola. They did not bring their Orixas, but 13"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"a class of spirits called Nkisis, largely understood on the same premises as one understands Orixas, as forces of nature. As the years passed we found two paths diverging from this same root, one that is associated with rv1acumba, usually understood to mean black magic and a general reference to spell working, and another one that is largely syncretistic with Candomblcs way of worship. The Nkisis became more alike Orixas than they were and accordingly many specific attributes of the faith were lost. Before discussing the origins of Kiumbanda in greater detail, it would be wise to discuss the concept of Death as well as our awareness of Death and Ancestry. Let us begin with shedding some light on this topic of ancestors and death as we find it within lfa: it was in this cult I came across a clearly formulated awareness of Death. The fundamentals concerning Death and its importance are somewhat similar in Ifa to the ones we are confronted with in Congo-derived faiths such as Palo Mayombe and Kiumbanda. In Ifa Death is considered to be one of the fundamental elements of the cult it self. Among the first things the apprentice is taught is how to connect with one's own ancestors. The ancestors are brought back into our awareness by giving them attention, prayers and offerings. The attention usually consists of deciding on a fixed day of the week, one or more days when one sits in front of the shrine prepared as the meeting point between the two worlds. On the table one usually finds, at the minimum, a white cloth, water, candle and items belonging to the deceased ones. One can place offerings in such place made up by the things in regard food and drink that the ancestor enjoyed to partake of when he or she was alive. The practices done in front of such a shrine are purely mediumistic and meditative in its nature and the modus operandi for such practices arc numerous. They vary from just lighting one single white candle and place a glass of water at its side on a fixed time every day where one is sitting and waiting. No acts are done, one simply place oneself in a receptive mode. With time one's ancestors and quite often other spirits will notice the regularity in one's routine and that one's desire for communication is growing. This way of taking the first step beyond the grave is frequently advised in temples ofUrnbanda and in Kardecist houses. This procedure is also the way advised here. One will soon be amazed by both how difficult it is to give, on a regular basis, these 10-20 minutes and also how quickly 14"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"one will enter into altered states of consciousness where communication will begin. The other effects of this practice are numerous and beneficial. Clairvoyance is usually amongst the first abilities to be developed with such practice. In the house of Kiumbanda referred to as The Brotherhood of the Red Room the necromantic aspects are emphasized more than is common in other houses, where the emphasis is on cultivating mediumistic abilities or entering possession. In The Red Room we are more focused on assisting people in cultivating their natural abilities in this regard and consequently no agenda is given on what one should learn, except the cultivation of death~a\\vareness. Another procedure one can apply to the establishment of one's ancestral shrine is prayers and the more classical openings of the ritual space f(mnd in many western schools of mabric and mystery. This can be done simply by sprinkling a few drops of the water in the four cardinal points and calling the elementals attention, thus purifying the elemental influence. TIle sanctification can be done effectively by reciting a simple incantation into the water, such the following: \"May this water be pure as it was on the day of its creation. Mayall negativity be cast out from this pool of purity and leave only the pure essence of water's healing and purifying powers.\" You will then blow on the water and in this careful exhalation you will direct your intention. As you exhale, see how your breath clears away all unhealthy and impure clements. The water is then ready to be used to purify the ritual arena. The prayers one will use at this stage should be composed according to one's beliefand heart. To use poetry ofsacred writ in this work should not be avoided, on the contrary. Sacred writ carries a peculi,lr and wonderful energy when applied in the right context, as doc's poetry. Poetry is the language given to that which we cannot express with anything else than heart and soul, the language of the Seer, as the poet Arthur Rimbaud expressed it. We will then present our purpose, namely to enter into communication and to understand, to re~enter into contact with those we thought were lost. Our ancestors are first and foremost those of our bloodline. In [fa, we find a deeply rooted belief, according to which reincarnation is usually restricted to one's bmily. Similar beliefs are held among many cultures on the African continent. Whether this is so or not should not be anything problematic; the point is that we should enter into contact with our own deceased ones. In some cases one will experience having a sort of kinship with people who have passed away but arc not of the same line offamily. This feeling ofkinship can be sought in people's profession, 15"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"interest, astrological influences and many other factors, in addition to one's spiritual elders, who can be viewed as an extended family. Regarding kinship by trade or profession, let us offer a couple of examples. A man devoting himself to martial arts will naturally feel a relationship to the dead masters in his lineage. Sometimes it might be good to include such persons in ones commemoration in front of ones shrine. If someone now finds their thoughts to drift toward the commemoration ofsaints as we find in the Catholic Church they arc not mistaken. The Doctors and Saints of the Catholic Church arc in every way the true lineage of the Church. The Holy St. Peter, the Rock of the Church, is said to rest his bones under the floor in the center ofChurch of St. Peter, close to the altar. When bishops are ordained in Rome they place their heads on the floor under which St. Peters bones rest, and by prayer and oil a connection is forged with him who is first of the long line of Dead Ones overseeing the Church. Another example could be a women initiated into Gardnerian Wicca. Wicca is a quite fresh line of initiatic wisdom, but it still has its ancestors. The Wiccan should accordingly meditate upon whether she should include Gerald Gardner in her commemoration of Ancestors. The Dead Ones arc there, it is just our awareness that has been distorted. By becoming aware again we take the first step on the path towards understanding the fundamental basis of Kiumbanda. Death in the As will be made clear within the pages ofthis treatise, Kiumbanda is more rooted in streams of European witchcraft than most people are aware of. It seems that the lovely Lady Pomba Gira has a dual origin: the Clan ofWitches from Evora and a purely African source. Let us look briefly at an interesting phenomena we find within the Wise-craft of Europe at this point. In the Craft of the Wise as we know it from many streams and also from folktales and folkloric studies we find \"The Wild Hunt\". Usually it is described as a fixed point in time and space where the dimensions between the other side and this side are flung open and spirits from the other side ride close to earth, if not within the earth. The most auspicious time in the western world is the twelve nights of the Yuletide, due to the great cosmic turns important for the changing of the seasons of our planet. It is a time of upheaval where the longest night and the shortest day meet at the time of winter solstice. One of the more useful and clear studies on the significance of the Time ofTurning Seasons and Misrule is Nigel Jackson's h.1asks ofMisrule. Some useful material can also be found in Carlo Ginzburgs Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath as well 16 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"as in Early Modern European \\Vitchcraft by Ankarloo and Henningsen. Hmvever, the mystical ride of wild hordes of spirits, phenomena like the dance macabre and the \\varding off of spirit possession at the night of All Hallows by joining in the masquerade are remnants of practices and beliefs we have lost important parts of: Quite often the significance ofthese tides of spirit intersection is referred to as moments where the powers of the initiatrix are present, a special time for those who seek the forgotten wisdom. Much has indeed become forgotten with the passing of ages. \\Ve rarely delve deeper into these junctures of extreme power, aside of their capacity as an initiatrix. At the root of all this we find Gods and Death blended with primordial pmver in many shapes and guises both known and unknown. It is this conglomerate we should seek to understand and Death is always the part that is withholding the larger part of the unsolved mystery, serving as the master key itself. Let us take a couple of examples: Frau Holt or Dame Holda or the Norse Huldra who are famous for their wild rides, during which they capture careless people and twist the vision and mind of those they set their eyes on. Their ride was shrouded in fear, for its sinister reputation and connection with the Guardian ofthe Mount Venus. For the Wise Folk we can assume it was considered a chance to enter into deeper understanding of the mystery within; by courage and will this mystery could be penetrated. Probably the insight which the people that deliberately entered into the initiatrix of the Wild Hunt gained was a deeper understanding of that Otherness we fear, Otherness where Death is the unavoidable portal and a restless key. If we turn our attention to the thought of Robert Cochrane we find the same deep realization of Death being the portal to that Otherness which carries the power of the Hidden Initiator. Cochrane used the symbol of the Castle resting at the other side of the river as well as the Rose and the Grave as metaphors for what he discovered during his tutoring by the Goddess of Love in her guise as Sorrow Herself. Spare's fascination with Thanateros, or the fusion ofThanatos or Death and Eros, is a point going much deeper into the Truth of the Otherness than first meets the eye. It is my impression that most people place their focus on the Eros part and thus on the more vulgar sense. Forbidden practices of sexual magic and bad counseling related to this difficult path of realization arc more often the rule than the exception. Eros is of grave importance and a subject that will be discussed in more depth in chapter five of this book. Spare used orgia as the image carrying his understanding and in the orgy he found the \\vild hunt, the intersection of Death \\vith Life; this we can see for instance in his formulae of the death posture and his suhlime artworks. These are just a few points worth noting in our attempt to understand 17"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ongin Death. In many ways the knowledge is still available, but eclipsed by intellectualization and the creation of certain distance to that which we can touch and feel. \\Ve use meditation and other tools to connect with that otherness carrying the mysteries. But rarely do we have the key forged by the Boneherd himself. We see the image, but grasp only the metaphor, because it cannot possibly be so true, this image of a skeleton forging the key in the fire that never quenches its heat! [n some streams ofTraditional Craft and Stregoneria we find, however, a deep awareness of the Dead \\Vitches of the Land, an awareness that is similar to the one we find in Kiumbanda. But to those who are aware we need say nothing, because they have already discovered that in the grave and amidst the bones of the Old \\Vitches of the Land lies the Key. Let us now turn our attention to the possible origin of Kiumbanda. The myths about the beginning of Kiumbanda arc many. I will present the most plausible one. I find this theory credible because similar ideas are found in Pethro Voudon and Palo 1,1ayombe, traditions said to have originated in the same area as Kiumbanda. The common origin is found amongst the Bantus in the lower western Africa. Certainly the mode of worship is quite different between the Bantus and Bantu Ewe in Congo and their neighboring tribes in Angola, than what resulted during the Diaspora, but it is the developments in the Diaspora that will be important in this context. The Tradition itself caught colour and elements from the land it grew on. It seems that many terms connected to the Cult of Kiumbanda have a Bantu origin, from the language known as \"kikongo\". The same is true ofPalo Mayombe. In Brazil we find the cult known as Umbanda: the word sounds similar ifnot equal to the Bantu term mbanda/ kiMbanda. This term signifies the ability to cure. Furthermore, there is the term kimbanda, signifying the ability to communicate with the otherness, but also the term kiumbanda, which is a term used in Cuban Palo Mayombe referring to the work of the Skull. The interpretation of the meaning of the terms is varied and we cannot be sure whether this is the correct use of this terms. However, this is the way these terms have been used in the Cult of Kiumbanda and Umbanda in BraziL They also convey the essence of what is important in the Cult of Kiumbanda, the communicative clement and its relation to the workings of the Skull or Skeleton. 18"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The first deified ancestor related to that which in time became known as Kimbanda or Kiumbanda is said to be a Congo king, the manikongo that received the name Tata Akongo. During the period of the slavery and commerce with the Portuguese this Tata Akongo was said to accept Catholic baptism and thus syncretism occurred between the local gods and spirits named Nkisi, and the catholic saints. This conversion resulted in rebellion and great opposition from those priests and worshippers that insisted on continuing the veneration of the old deities. These rebellious groupings called them selves for Bagandas or Baluandas and claimed to belong to the Devil. These groups conquered vast areas of Congo and Angola and established several kingdoms that in the eyes of the newly converted king were considered heretical. However, in time the king decided to join forces \\\\lith the rebellious groups and thus reclaim the lost faith. However, many slaves were brought to Brazil in the \\61h and 17\\h Century and they were from both groupings, the rebellious ones than belonged to the Devil and those who believed in Jesus Christ. In Brazil the Congolese people found mutual resonance with the Tupi speaking Indians of Brazil, exchanging sorcerous secrets and partaking in each others heritage. Thus we find the cult ofCaboclos (Indians) and Preto Vclhos (Old Blacks) related to Umbanda, Kimbanda and Candombl6. The separation between Umbanda and Kimbanda is still very clear. Even if many practitioners advocate working with both hands to maintain a balance between powers, the common advice is still that one should be careful not to work too much with Kimbanda, as one is dealing with evil and less developed forces than what is the case with Umbanda. The pantheon we find in Kimbanda was in the beginning of its formation centered around Nkisi, but due to its involvement with Candombl6 many deities disappeared and the cult is usually assembled around the spirit known as Exu. This has caused a lot of confusion, because we find that they also have a similar deity in Santeria and Ifa. The Exu of the cult of Kiumbanda is not the same deity found in the Tradition of Ifa. On the contrary, it seems that the histories stating that the spirits of Congo came with the Tatas (priests) and Yayas (priestesses) of the Congo t~dth in the form of Ngangas are most accurate. Nganga is a term that can mean 'a pot of medicine' or refer to the priest himself. Either way, we arc speaking about either the priest or his spirit, which according to the awareness we already have discussed in relation to Death would also contain a reference to the souls of dead priests and priestesses of this cult. Another term connected to the practice of Kiumbanda is ~1akumba or mkiumba that I have seen translated as 'spirits of the night'. This makes sense, since in 19"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Kiumbanda most works are done in the nighttime. It also rdates to the mystical point of ingress of the \"other side\". All these terms we have used here are found both within Kiumbanda and Palo Mayombe and also the form of Candomble said to be of an Angolan origin. Oppression and rebellion against ahuse of power, whether religiously or materialistically motivated, seem to have been the case both amongst the kikongo speaking people and also in Haiti. The birth of the Pethro family ofLoas in Haitian Voudan is said to be born of rebellion and battle. A common opinion on the origin of this family ofhot and dark Loa is that it has its origin in the slave rebellion in 1757, leaded by Francois MakandaL In Voudon we find a famous term zombi. This term probably has a kikongo root in the term nsambi, which is technically a reference to god. In Haiti, according to the information given in Ross Heaven's book, nsambi means 'spirit of a dead person'. So, the original meaning is lost, the word is kept and given a new content. In Haitian Voudon we also find a family of spirits considered to be earthhound, dangerous, lustful and at the same time good guides, funny and helpful. These spirits are known as the Ghuedes. There arc far too many similarities between this class ofspirits and what we find in the cult of Kiumbanda for it to be a coincidence. When we note there is also a form of Haitian Palo Mayombe, the picture seems to add up concerning their possible common root. Nothing can be said with absolute certainty regarding the historical tracings of Kiumbanda. History is a discipline \\\\There we reconstruct the past according to the facts and information we have at hand. As new facts and information appears we may have to change the opinions we have. According to the information that I have been able to gather the picture now laid before us seems to be just as plausible as any. We now need to return to the concept of Nganga. The Nganga is used both as a word describing the 'pot of medicine' of the priest as well as the priest himself. The Nganga has been suggested, by several of my int(mnants, to be the origin ofthe Cult ofKiumbanda in BraziL The N ganga in Palo Mayome refers to the pot of medicine also known as a Prenda or treasure. The Nganga is a physical reconstruction of a domain already in existence in the world, like the ocean, the river, mountain or principles, like fire, war etc. The 'pot of medicine' is then created according to this 20 "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"given natural resonance. This part can be said to partake of the domain of a given nkisi or spirit, like for instance the spirit of the Cemetery that is known in Palo Mayombe by the name Coballende. A spirit pertaining to this domain, but also the spirit of the Dead Ones then constructs a world upon this energetic manifestation under the guidance of that spirit. An important part of the construction of the Nganga is related to making a pact \\vith the soul of a dead person, usually referred to with the term egun. This spirit is considered the guiding spirit and it is accordingly of grave importance to cultivate the relationship with the egun. If the spirit of the dead one, the egun, is not cooperating the Nganga will be just a useless collection of materials. If this is the root of the Cult of Kiumbanda it means that Kiumbanda is born of the same principles as we find in Palo Mayombe and that Kiumbanda is basically a Cult of Death, which with the advent of Pomba Gira became infused with European witchcraft. A source for much confusion and misunderstanding is found in Exu. As already mentioned Exu is not the same deity as the Eshu Elegua and E~u we find in Santeria and Ifa. The Exu of Kiumbanda is a spirit probably born by a similar womb that gave Voudon their Ghuedes. In general they arc the eguns of past priests and priestesses of the diasporic Congolese faiths as well as the eguns of witches and sorcerers that displayed a certain kind of affinity with the lifeblood of this cult. This will be further elaborated on in chapter three. One suggestion to the cause of this confusion can be found by looking at what happened when western eyes looked into Yoruba culture and how they understood E~{l. In essence this fiery deity, ~o important for the dynamics of Ha. was demonized immediately and in E.;lu they saw the Devil. Seeing this in contrast to the Congolese rebellion. where they actively advocated residing on the side of the Devil, we can have a faint idea of how this happened. The Yoruba E~u is considered to be the taskmaster of the gods. the friend of man and more importantly the deity taking your prayers to God, so that they can be answered. \\Ve find the same elements, to some degree, in the Kiumbanda Exu. This point is interesting enough to justify returning to it in due course. The Yoruba E~u is a deity you must treat with great respect: no foul language is accepted and his intervention is crucial in the Cult of Ita. The Exu of Kiumbanda are generally vulgar, displaying a great appetite for strong drinks, tobacco and sexual topics in conversations. These preferences arc recognized as pertaining to earthbound spirits and 21"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"commonly to eguns, as well as the Ghuedes in Voudon. Even this short consideration of their preferences shows a great dissimilarity they have with each other; therefore they cannot be the one and the same. There are many other differences too, but the intention is not to make a comparative study, but just making clear that and Exu are not the same deity. Another interesting field of study we will leave out is the curious phenomena we find in Santeria and Cuban Ifa. There we find a minimum of lOt different paths of E.;ili and many of them with a deep connection with Death in the form of pacts. They however refer to E~u as Eshu Elegbara or Esu Elegba. One can get the impression that :E:~u is an active spirit that sees nothing wrong in lending his name and power to a variety of manifestations, this phenomena would however be proper to his nature, as the principle of movement and transformation. These points arc mentioned in order not to confuse Exu with any other spirit or deity based on the similarity of name. In this work the focus will be on the Brazilian cult of Exu and Pomba Gira. It is now time to enter deeper into the understanding of Exu and his many masks. 22 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":".....' of How Kiumbanda became associated with Umbanda or the Orixa cult is a question that creates a variety of responses. As we saw in the previous chapter, the confusion between EliU and Exu has to some extent been explained. The association with the cult ofExu related to the spiritist practices of Umbanda hint towards another source of explanation and clarification. Tb understand this synthesis we need to embrace both modern Augustinian theoloh'Y as developed by, for instance, Gregory ofRimini and Allan Kmiec's teachings. Allan Kardec is commonly known as the father of spiritism. At the center of spiritism lies a firm belief in afterlife and the communicativeness ofdeparted ancestors. Equally firm is the beliefthat in death we go through some sort ofevolution toward light. This means that the spiritist orientation is Christian in essence, with an emphasis on the sinful state of humankind and the need for evolution also in the afterlife. Death does not pay for one's sins. This dualist stance will of course bring us to a domain where good and evil fight, where one force pulls down and the other pulls up. While agreeing that man has impulses that can bring him down, the planetary lower octaves that are turned towards opposition, it might not be very useful for our study to embrace anything else than the platonit: idea of 'the union of same and other', whkh will be much more t\\l be the point in our study. However, we need to deeper at the issues we have been dist:ussing, in order to pave a way toward a more unified understanding of the role of Exu in Life, World and Creation. Kardn: u \\Vhen Allan Kardec and his book The Book of Spirits appeared in Brazil in 1858 it found a good ground to rest on. There was a spiritistically oriented theosophical-homeopathic movement established in Brazil as early as 1818, led by minister Jose Bonifacio de Andrada. Jose Bonifacio was a Master Mason, t1uent in twelve languages and the most int1uential cause of Brazi!'s independence. Emperor Don Pedro I is reputed to have missed the whole independence due to a heavy diarrhea, while Bonifacio was putting the pieces together. He also was the man behind the abolishment of slavery. He was however exiled in 1823 to France but returned in 1829. 23"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"This resulted in Bonifacio creating stronger ties with the I-,'Towing interest at spiritism in France. The impact left by Bonifacio made the ground ready for the slogan 'God, Christ and Charity' among the many homeopathic doctors sharing a common interest in spiritism. Just before Kardec's influential b(x)k appeared, the ideas of Andrew Jackson Davies and his The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelation that were especially influential. When Kardec's book appeared it became a rapid success and new Kardecist centers opened equally fast. The basic tenets of Kardec's philosophy were a Christian oriented moral philosophy where charity was the focus. As most people know spiritism had as the goal communication with the dead in what was called a seance. The Book of Spirits was a compilation of answers to questions posed to the dead. The book gave answers on most existential dilemmas people suffered from and opened a window to the enigmatic afterlife. The foundation of this philosophy has its basis in man being a spiritual being, the body simply serving as a vessel for the spirit. The spirit has also a semi-material texture the personality is located, so in a way this semi-material part of our spirit body, called perispirit, is the element that makes communication possible. When the body falls away in death the spirit lives on in its semi-material condition. The personality one had while being in the physical vessel lives on in this condition. Usually the perispirit is not visible, but it can be perceived in the right circumstances. The purpose of life on earth is to present us with a series of ordeals the spirit needs to pass through until it achieves moral perfection. Consequently we find the belief in reincarnation and past lives crucial for our evolution and moral growth. There is also a hierarchy of spirits that is constructed by allegory. This means that a good man will turn into a good spirit and an evil man into an evil spirit. The classes Kardec operated with were superior, medium, inferior and evil. The evil needed to evolve into a superior state of spirit. The superior spirits are considered to follow the example ofJesus Christ, advocating good action and benevolence. The recommendation is that all of us should make ourselves as useful in society as possible. In the afterlife nothing is hidden and we need to account for all our shortcomings and acts ofevil by going through ordeals that elevate our moral sense. Especially the focus on charity appealed to people. Even today in the Terreiros or temples of Umbanda, there is no charge for their spiritual services, as is also the case in the many Spiritist Centers around the country. There is of course also the emphasis on mediumship in the Kardecist centers, a heritage that was continued when Umbanda was born in the 1920s. It also influenced Candomblc, the Brazilian expression of Orixa worship. Umbanda was born in a Kardecist climate. Since the possibility of spirit communication had been established, some people wanted to use these tools to speak with other forms of spirits, an idea the Christian­24"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"based Kardecists rejected violently. It was the man Zelio de Moraes in Rio de Janeiro who is ascribed with the honor of birthing Umbanda. In a session he received a spirit that had followed him since he wa~ a young man. This spirit \\vas not an ancestor by blood, but an Indian or caboclo, which is the usual term for this class of spirits. This caboclo said he was Cabodo das Sete Encruzilhadas (Caboclo of the Seven Crossroads) and the spirit-guide of Moral'S. From this date on, in 1920, a movement that advocated trafficking with different types of spirits began to grow. The orientation changed; the spirit-guide became the center of the cult and this created a similarity of structure, yet with a variety of practices, even though all houses ofUrnbanda acknowledged the importance of cultivating one's mediumistic abilities and being motivated by kindness and charity: the moral and philosophical foundation of Kardec was very much intact stilL This new movement was not looked upon kindly by the government and much work needed to be done in the night, which created only more fear and paranoia with the police. The term macumba as referring to all kinds ofspell work and satanic based magic was conceived. It is here in the cradle ofUmbanda WL' find the roots of Quimbanda. These first conclaves of umbandistas were primarily of two kind. Either they focused the cult on hard drinking, tobacco, snake-worship, blood sacrifice and ecstasy or they rejected these tools in favor of a more serene way of cultivating their spirits. In till' more ecstatic grouping we find a great amount of impulse from the Bantus, by racial heritage. McGregor says in his study that the Bantus were more drawn to Umbanda since their theogony was quite similar to the central ideas in Umbanda; trance states, possession and incorporation of spirits was an important art of the Bantu Ewe cult. We also find the importance placed on Death and departed ancestors. It is the same people, the Bantus, who inspired the Palo Mayombe cult in Cuba. But there is more to this mix than the Bantu inHuence, spiritism, \\'L'neration and channeling of the spirits native to Brazil. We also have the witches and heretics, wizards and criminals who were exiled from Portugal to Brazil. There is especially the study made by Gilberto Freyr in 1933 we sihmld take notice of. In his book The Masters and The Slaves he speaks about the development of Brazilian culture. The Portuguese who came to Brazil considered sorcery, black magic and sexual magic to he an African phenomena. But as the records received by the Holy Office in Brazil show, there came a host of people exiled by the Inquisition, hasically on the grounds of various evil-doings, witchcraft and satanic pacts. The African sorcerers and the exiled witches probably found much common ground and a mutual exchange of information took place, which will hecoll1e apparent in the chapter on The Devil's Lover wherL' we will 25"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"go deeper into the archives of the Holy Office in Portugal and Spain. We can offer only two rather famous examples here, both ofPortuguese women exiled to Brazil. One of them was Antonia Fernandes, known as Nobrega, who claimed to have been taught her witchcraft by the Devil. Another one, \"tvlaria Gonl.;alves, a notorious necromancer also claimed allegiance with Satan, even after being exiled. It seems a massive amount of the satanically biased witchcraft came over to Brazil and found resonance with the Bantu sorcerers and thus gave rise to the uniquely Brazilian form of witchcraft known as Kimbanda, Quimbanda or Kiumbanda. Considering the many meanings attached to this linguistic root of Kimbanda, the word itself probably carried many meanings. Maybe the word quite simply referred to someone who was well versed in the ritual practices ofthe Bantus, as with the word Nganga, which can mean both the spirit vessel and the priest itself. As we saw in the previous chapter, the word can also mean other things. In other words, the meaning is quite uncertain, but the point is that Kiumbanda became more and more associated with Back :Magic and related to the deity known as Exu and the female deity known as Pomba Gira. How Exu became associated with Kiumbanda is probably by analogy as wei\\. There were already Yoruba people in Brazil and the Cult of Orixa was widespread. The very often misunderstood and complex Orilia, Esu, probably became the iconic and functional model for the Kiumbanda Exu. Esus reputation amongst missionaries visiting Yorubaland was that Esu was simply the Devil. In Catholic Brazil the tendency of seeing Esu as the Christian Devil continued. The witches of Portugal and the sorcerers of Congo found a deity they could unite around and thus the Yoruba Esu became the icon for the protective deity of the sorcerers. In a way, we can say that Esu lent willingly his reputation, name and icon to the cult. But the fact remains that the Exu we find in Kiumbanda is quite different than the Yoruba Esu. Even if there is a great tendency of mixing the planes here, even amongst practitioners, we should state firmly that Esu and Exu are not the same. There are the differences ofculture, lituq,'Y and preferences for offerings. Some offerings given to Exu are absolute taboo for Esu. We should instead accept and embrace Exu as the God of Brazilian witchcraft, a hideous mix of spiritism, Satanism, witchcraft and African sorcery and wisdom, and leave Esu amongst the Orilias where he belongs. The question now remains: is Exu really the Devil? \\Ve find two trains of thought in the revival of Kimbanda, which is still ongoing. One takes on the satanic attitude and the other denies Exu's diabolic being. I would say both are wrong. Exu is the Devil: the problem is that we do not seem to understand the DeviL \\Ve should therefore look deeper into the Devil's Masquerade in our search. 26"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"tn.banda -the ~iagnil1cent Seven We have seen that Umbanda had a tremendous influence on Brazilian spirituality and religious life. And we need to go a bit deeper into the beliefs of Urnbanda itself to understand the confusion surrounding Exu and how he became associated with the Devil in roday's iconography. Umbanda is a form of worship centered around the deity, which the presiding father of the terrdro has received (i.e. channeled) and the rules and orders of the terreiro arc influenced by this deity. The growth of Umbanda managed to absorb many different deities within its fold. Different classes of eguns were incorporated, such as dead marineiros (sailors and seamen) and encantados (those taken away in nature) and boiadciros (cowboys). So the classes of death grew and at some point the need arose to structure these herds of Eguns. A separation into lines became the norm. These lines came to be understood as controlled by certain Orixa. The various Orixa cults in the Diaspora have always been subject w syncretization with Catholicism, not only as a consequence of persecution and slavery, but also due to the similarities in the theological structure. Accordingly, it was not difficult to see in the Saints, the holy dead, mirror image of the Orixas and their attributes. The cult of the Orixa was originally cultivated in what is known as Candomblc in Brazil, and it is from CandomblC Umbanda adopted Orixa. They became associated as the rulers of the lines of spirits in Umbanda probably because their association with Saints, but also because the cult of the Orisa was a cult indigenous to Brazil. Therefore, by adopting also this pantheon, a fusion of all spirits of this land under the southern cross could be made reality. Quite soon, it became necessary to concretize the rules of Umbanda in order to achieve some degree of unity. \\Ve should probably say 'unity in diversity', in itself quite impressive. 1111S was prohahly made possible because the ideals of charity and good will that lie in the cradle ofUmbandas birth. During the'50s and '60s when Umbanda became more solidified, a separation between 'high' and 'low' Umbanda became more and more distinct. The 'low' Umbanda was still accepted but it was increasingly considered a barbaric form for worship, a necessary evil that one needed to be involved with, since one did a charitable and good work for the perverse spirits on the other side and helped them in their evolution. Bad spirits, like EXll or Bongbongira were considered to be rude, unpredictable, bloodthirsty and amhivalent. They were accordingly in need ofevolution toward the light. By cultivating these spirits one did them a favor, but any use of these spirits' favors was considered dangerous and meddling with the Black Arts. The Black Arts 27"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"are generally disapproved off in most terreiros ofUmbanda, while practices more akin to natural magic are considered in good ways. McGregor tells of the growth ofUmbanda that by the beginning ofthe '60s there were 25.000 members of Umbanda in only three of Brazil's states (Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Guanabara) and it was rapidly growing. During the oppression of the '70s, Candomble became a sort of frontier for the many black pride movements in Brazil. Here we probably find the answer as to how the deity of Congo, originally called Bongbongira became associated with Esu and how Exu and Pomba Gira became solidly planted \\vithin the religious environment of Brazil. Since these deities were considered 'low' among the Umbandistas, the black movement of course absorbed them within its fold where everything became 'Orixafied', also the 'Congo Exu'. The '70s were a time when Pai and Miie de Santos (Father and Mother of Saints) were made at the speed of baking bread, according to Carlos de Oxossi, an elderly Pai de Santo who followed the explosion in the '70s. This resulted in a great amount of fresh Babalorixas and lyalorixas with limited knowledge and understanding, who began to mix and blend bits and pieces of whatever could fit in the image. What did not fit was in many cases forced to fit. In our days, there is still a deep difference between the more traditional, old houses of Candomble and those lacking tradition, which were to a large extent those houses, which came into being in the '70s. One of the many consequences was that Exu and Esu now became assimilated with each other. In one regard this makes perfectly sense. Esu thrives upon revolution and change. This is a fundamental and strong feature of his character, being and function. That ESt, found it proper to lend his name to this class of spirits is quite understandable in light of the rebellious history of transformation and change that resulted in this (con)fusion concerning Exu and Esu. Umbanda separates its spirits into seven lines, or more properly class of spirits, headed by an Orixa and his or her syncretically aligned Christian figure. In what came to be the dark mirror of Umbanda, Quimbanda, we also find seven lines ofspirits, but they are usually referred to as Legions, in order to strengthen the infernal connotation of this path of the Art. The Seven lines of Umbanda arc subject to some variation, especially the seventh line ruled by Omolu, the Lord of the Graveyard, connected to Saturn and the class of spirits related to Quimbanda. In Umbanda theogony this sphere of existence seems to be hard to embrace and understand as anything other than spirits in need of elevation. This is probably a heritage of Kardec, who had no place for spirits dwelling in the realms experienced to be far away from the light. Many attempts have been done to transform this line of spirits, to make it more proper, in the 28"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"light of spiritual evolution being central. One of these attempts has been to subject the lines to the rulership of St. Cyprian and let the line represent all kind of African derived faiths. Some say that the line should be under the rulership of St. John the Baptist. Let us see how one of many possible organizations of the seven lines looks like: The First Line is ruled by Orixa OxaIa, usually syncretized with Jesus Christ himself. Other Saints finding their place in this line is St. Anthony, St. Catherine, St. Cosme, St. Damian and St. Franz of Assisi. This line is recognized by its spiritual purity, the colors of Oxala being white and his day Sunday. Sometimes he is also associated with Apollo. The Second Line is ruled by Orixa Yemanja, also known as Nossa Senhora de Aparecida or Our Lady ofGlory. Yemanja's domain arc the salty waters and oceans. In her fold we find other Orixas too, like Nananuluku who is syncretized with Mary Magdalene; Indians and sailors who died in the Ocean, Undines, Nlermaids, and lines within lines due to the many different Eguns in this line. For instance the dead Indians (caboclos) arc ruled by Yara, those who died in the ocean arc ruled by Indahl and the dead sailors are ruled by Tarima and we even have room for Calunga, which means little cemetery (for those who died in water). The word is of Congo origin and is used in Palo Mayombe today, carrying the same meaning. Symbolic representation for spirits of this line arc all things related to water, [he compass and instruments for measuring the stars of the sky. The colors white, crystal and blue. The line is symbolized by the moon. The Third Line is ruled by Orixa Ogum whose saintly image is found in St. George, and to some lesser extent in St. Anthony. Ogum is the spirit of iron and warfare, a mighty protector who is symbolized with weapons, usually represented by the colors red and green. Ogum has seven legions under him, connected to sites of nature and African tribes, like Ogum Beira Mar is the Ogum of the seashore. Ogum Yara presides over the rivers and Ogum Nag6 is the protector of the tribe with the same name. Ogum is also said to be the guardian of Exu and often one see a form of Ogum guarding the representation of Exu. This line is connected to Mars. The Fourth line is ruled by Oxossi or St. Sebastian. Oxossi is the glld of the hunt whose colors arc white and green. As a great hunter carrying the bow and arrow as his symbol he is naturally connected to Cabodos, the native Indians of BraziL The founding spirit of Umbanda, Caboclo das Sete Encruzilhadas is to be found in this line. The more interesting native spirits in this line is Jurema, who has a entire cult 29"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"connected to her related to the folk magic practices of the forest dwellers. Another spirit is Caboclo Cobra-Coral who is doing powerful magic using this most poisonous snake in his work. The cult ofJurema is connected to the usc of ethnogens as well, utilizing the bark of a tree known as Jurema in their ceremonies which are mildly hypnotic. The fifth line is ruled by the Orixa of Fire and Thunder, Xango, who is syncretized with St. James and sometimes with Sta. Barbara. His colours arc purple, red and white. He is symbolized with the meteorite and the double ax. We find St. John the Baptist in this line and also St. Peter. We also find his wife Yansan ruling one of the seven lines in this class ruled by Xang6 and we find Caboclos ruling most of the others. 1() place St. John the Baptist and St. Peter in this solar and Jupiterian realm is another correspondence that are Inet with some discussion and divergent opinions. As already commented, some people want to place St. John the Baptist in the last line. The sixth line belongs to Orix(l Oxum, deity of fresh water, sweetness, seduction and Love. Her planet is rightly Venus and her saintly image Sta. Catherine. The seventh line is usually ascribed the rulership of Omolu, the Lord of the Graveyard. This line is sometimes referred to as the Line of Souls due to the power of life and death given to the spirits in this line. The planet ascribed to this line is Saturn and the saint is Lazarus. The conflict in regard this line is so great that everything from Jesus Christ to Lucifer has been considered to be the ruler for the seventh line. Since this line also contains Exu we can find the confusion and disagreement to be quite understandable. We should also mention here that Omolu usually are said to be the same as Obaluwaye due to their common hot temper and relationship with hot earth. This is in fact not tme. They are not the same. Omolu is actually a deity from the lbo tribe in Nigeria and since the Yoruba tribe, also in Nigeria, has a deity with similar features, called Obaluwaye there is often to see the mistake of thinking they arc one and the same. The same issue is found with Osumare that in some Umbanda houses are seen to reside in the sixth line as a bisexual deity related to Oxum (his Brazilian name being Oxu-mare). Also this is erroneous, since even Osumare originally came from lbo, but this deity was incorporated amongst the Orixas ofthe Yorubas, unlike Omolu, that were fused together in Brazilian Candomblc. 30"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Louren~o Braga for instance gives a different selection on the lines and separates them according to angels ruled by St. Michael. So we will find that Anael in his quality of Neptune will rule the line of enchantments. Orifid, will rule the minerals kingdon presiding over the mysteries of Xango. Gabriel, by being the Angel of Moon will naturally rule waters and Yemanja, even if he is given the domain of Venus by Braga, he also places St. John the Baptist in this line. Jesus will be related to the Line of Souls and Oxala as the angel of Jupiter. The angel Rafael who is given Uranus will be related to the line of the Orient and wisdom. Mercurial Zadkiel will be related to Oxossi and the vegetal kingdom while Samac! by his Marsian dominance will rule over Ogums line. Further he is separating the angels into the rulerhip of the seven continents, affixing seven saints to head legions as he is also doing with the Caboclos. There is a seemingly endless organization oflines and legions, classes and spirits, saints and eguns. Not surprisingly we find that the same seven fold division is found also in the classification of Quimbanda spirits. Also here we find many variations, but one of the more encountered separations are as follows and this line will he commented upon more in depth in the fifth chapter. Linha Malei is headed by Exu Rei (King Exu). This line is considered to be very pure and consist of only Exus that often can cause disturbance, fights, misery and impotence. The Exus of this line arc often depicted with trident and sword. Some call this line a red line. Linha Nago headed by Exu Geren!. This line is said to be Congolese and consist of many dead priests and priestesses of the Congo faith. However, the name of the line Nagtl - suggest that the origin is more Nigerian. The nature of the line is however arc in tunc with Congo practice than Yoruba practice. Linha Caboclos Quimbandeiros is headed by Exu Pantera Negra. This line is ruled by Exu Black Panther and consist mainly ofdead Indians who were reputed sorcerers. In some cases it is understood to be a line of American Indians and arc generally considered to be very ruthless these spirits. Linha Mista is headed by Exu das Campinas. Exu of the many fjelds take the eguns of any nationality into his fold, especially those with the power of provoking incurable illness. Linha das Almas headed by Exu Omulu. These spirits are given demonic features, with their long cars and horns and arc ascribed to the cemetery. These spirits are the intermediaries between life and death and commands great respect. 31"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Linha dos Cemiterios is headed by Exu Caveira. \\Ve could also call this line the line of Skeletons and this is another class feared and respected. They have the ability to heal and also give diseases of the brain and blood that are virtually impossible to heal. Linha Mossurubi headed by Exu Kaminaloft. These spirits have a tribal look with their facial painting and piercings. They are usually employed for use in the Black Arts, and especially mental disorder and insanity is in their domain. They have many features in common with the spirits of the mixed line (Linha Mista). Seven is a number ofgreat importance which is reflected in the seven lines, with seven legions in each line both in Umbanda and Quimbanda. And seven is indeed an important number. It is the combination of 3 and 4 the union of the female and male principle that find its shape in the piscia veschi the geometrical fish made by two intersecting circles whose diameter is constructed upon the number seven. There arc seven notes in the musical scale, seven archangels, seven apocalyptic seals, seven wonder's, seven continents and Salomon used seven years to build the temple. We also have the seven stars and their constellations. and It seems that Quimbanda has been subject to a tendency similar to the spirit of revival these days, where more diabolic approaches are applied and also approaches done by western occultists, especially rooted in thelema. How forfeited such approach is will hopefully be evident by the end of this grammar. In Brazil the main tendency seem to be to view Exu either as a devilish figure in need ofevolution towards the light or as a satanic being in the sense ofbeing perverse and corrupted. But, no matter what approach taken, there is a common consensus that these spirits are wise and capable of helping man with their everyday problems. Exu comes in many shapes and forms speaking of his prominence in all nature. At virtually all sites of nature, in all nocturnal beings and all nocturnal actions and everything mysterious we find Exu. In the hard liquor, in the drops of fire and at the trunk of trees we find Exu. [n the velvet t~lbric, in the mud of the river, in the forest and as the spirit ally of the bat we also find him. [n the streets and crossroads, the cemetery and the black stone we find these intriguing deities known as Exu and Pomba Gira. Usually Exu is representing the instability of these sites in the nature or of the site he 32 "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"or she is associated with. Exu Tranca Ruas is associated with the streets and his ambivalent nature can be demonstrated by him being responsible both to agitate fights in the streets as well as protecting the entrance of the house against thieves and violence. Exu Pimenta can both heal you as well as poison you with his herbal potions. Pomba Gira can lead you to a perfect lover as well as lead you into the perfect sexual assault. It is this ambivalence that has given these deities their reputation of being evil and related to the deviL Certainly this ambivalence and this challenging attitude easy find its reflection in Jehova's adversary and given the Christian orientation of the cultural soil of these spirits the diabolic label easily get attached to them. We do not seem to understand anymore how useful and how dependent we are of this force of disruption and resistance. We do not sec the importance of our darker sides as Odin saw his need for Loke, his disruptive blood brother of fire and change. Instead there is a tendency to degreade these impulses and the spirits associated with those parts ofhuman nature we consider as improper, impure or against the grain. The idea of unity has been lost. Oppositions need to stand apart in our mind, given that we have embraced dualism to such an extent that the role and function of the devil as n accuser and a challenger aiming towards transformation has been lost in a havoc of diabolic profanity. Maybe by turning to the 6th Century and look at the medieval times we can understand better what happened with the devils position after his \"fall from grace\". In a sixth Century mosaic in Ravenna we encounter an interesting imagery. The Christ seated between the Devil and the Good Angel. Christ i, giving the sheep's to the Good angel and the goats to the Devil. Both the Devil and the Good angel are depicted with the halo, just like Christ himself, ,ignifying a mutual divine status. The main point of difference is the colors. The Devil is depicted in dark blue and the Good Angel in scarlet red. The dark blue hue signifies the terrestrial or material domain and the blood red color signifies the divine flame or pure spirit. The interesting point is their mutual connection with divinity and Christ seated between them, all of them in their holiness. Turning to the philosophers of the via negativa such as Origen and Dionysus can maybe reveal a key to this theological dilemma. The via negativa is concerned with the hidden god, the veils of mystery and the difficulties we are confronted with in understanding the godhead. Dionysus said that the path towards the godhead was a gradual clearing 33"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"of the darkness, but still the mystery would be clouded in unknowing. \"To understand is to know, to know is to know that we do not know\", Dionysus said. To grasp the unknowing and start the process towards knowing we need to struggle against pathe, which means our confused and ambivalent emotions and passions and reach the stage called apatheia or a calm mind in the spiritual sense. Only by this we can reach eirene (the peaceful and divine condition) and become as gods. The term pathe is interesting in this regard. It is a natural condition we need to overcome in order to become as gods. In this term we find both ambivalence and the struggle of opposing forces within the Seeker himself. Without pathe we can not start the path of knowledge and realize our divinity. The Fallen Ones is usually understood to be morally ambivalent, a feature they have in common with the Greek daimons and the Arabic jinns. The demonologist Psellos demonstrated an occupation with the classification of the empyrean and infernal classes of spirits. He pointed out not only the ambivalent nature of the infernal legions, but also the way they work. He said that demons act directly upon our senses by provoking phantastikos or images and by this influence they can influence indirectly nous, or mind. Socrates ascribed his ability of thinking and reasoning to the work of his daimon, the word that later became \"demon\" in its reference to hostile spirits related to the four elements, especially air. Jeffrey Russell in his hook on Lucifer recounts a heresy that we should look closer at, the Bogomil heresy. This heresy was presented by a Bulgarian man by the name Bogomil, meaning \"heloved of god\" in 950. During the 12th Century the Bogomil heresy was separated into two slightly different strands of thinking, one dualist stance what took the name The Order of Dragovitsa and the less dualistic one, The Order of Bulgaria. Central for this heresy was its demonology that indicateed a varied influence both in regard to sources of thinkers as well as culture. Shortly their demonology said that Satanael was the elder brother ofJesus Christ. Satanael was jealous ofJesus position, since God favored him. We see here how this conflict amongst the heavenly inhabitants is an early mirror image of the dispute between Cain and Abel. The elder brother being jealous of the position he believed the younger brother to have in the eyes of God. Satanael decides on this basis to create the cosmos and the spheres, replicating in a vaster extent the heaven and earth God made. This separation of domains led the Bogomils to state that Satanael was the God described in the Hebrew canonical writings, popularly referred to as the Old Testament and accordingly the Teacher and Guide of the writer of the Torah, Moses. This would then indicate that the ten commands and the Israelite laws and the rather ruthless behavior of the God of the Hebrews were in reality the jealous Satanacls attempt to enchain humankind. Satanael were also involved with earth 34 "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"as he created Adamos from mud and substances of the earth. He however failed in animating the corpse of Adamos and asked help from God to bring this being, created by divine hands and mind to life. God agreed to help Satanael and animated Adamos. They then create Cheva/Eve in the ~ame fa~hion. Satanael makes the body and God gives life and soul. Satanael desires his creation and he bestows his seed in Eve's womb resulting in the birth of twins, Cain and Calomena. Later Abel was born by Adamos after intercourse with After Cains murder of Abel God is removing Satanaels ability to create and embark on a rescue operation of mankind's divinity resulting in the preparing of the way for the Messiah. With the mission of Jesus Satanael is thrown from grace a second time, but this time he falls by the name Satan, the epitaph -el removed from his identity. The epitaph -el means \"son of God\" or \"Godborn\". In this case we can say that Satanel would indicate his role as divine adversary, a needed element. \\Vith his second fall his opposing qualities are no longer recognized and he simply is turned into something devastating for humankind, as we read: \"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour\" (1. Peter 5: 8). The Bogomils ,aw the Devil as pure matter and accordingly the Roman Catholic Church were renounced as a cu1tic center for Devil worship based upon their pivotal tendency towards aesthesis in their Churches. The Bogomils considered any representation of divinity that were connected to senses or matter to represent the kingdom of Satanae!' At the heart oftheir doctrine we find however the interesting idea that God created Satanael from his own shadow and in Bogomil iconography we sec Satanac! and God often represented in friendly communion. We also see how they cooperated in the beginning and even when Satanel creates the cosmos and ask for help to animate a being he made, God comes to his aid. The Bogomils said it was quite evident that the body was the work of Satanac! since in death the body goes back to matter, while the soul goes back to its spiritual domains. It all goes back to where it belongs, hut the composition of spirit and matter is in itself a creation blessed by God and thus representing the divine order in a unique way. There are many points of reference between this heresy and what is said to be the beliefs amongst the Yezidi of Kurdistan. What Joseph lsya referred to as devil-worship. We find the same theme concerning Melek l;tu~, the beautiful and beloved angel of God, who fell due to pride, but was forgiven and replaced on the throne ofGod. Similar to what befell Satand and his first fall, he was actually replaced in his previously lofty position. Mclek T:1US also carries a dual function. In front of God he assumes the name Iblis but in his terrestrial form he is called Shaytan, or tempter. We 35"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"find the same theme, that the devilish being is divine and seemingly a needed clement in the creation. Shaytan is said to be represented by the spiritual fire and interestingly enough the class of beings said to be more ambivalent than any other. according to AI Qran, arc the spirits said to be made from fire, the djinns. Djinn or jinn -or the female jinniya are associated with places related to the Otherness, like caves, sub-terrestrial domains and graveyards. They can bless and curse \\vith the same hand and arc usually feared for their power and unpredictability. \\Ve find the same ambivalence in the Teutonic and Norse class ofdeities especially in the case of Holda and her wild hunt as well as the mystery surrounding Odin. It is the element of otherness, legions of alien forces and the darkness we see. This Otherness tends to produce fear and we feel we need to defend our selves against these fearsome forces that threaten our harmony. The Shadow used as a term in both psychoanalysis and mystical teaching refers to the unknown. Those impulses and forces we deem unstable and ambivalent because we don't understand them. But in reality it can be just as much the stage ofpathc we need to resolve, the unity of \"same and other\". The battle between same and other is seen in the battle of the Gods in the Norse pantheon in regard to the Vanir and Aesir. This also represents the fight between the satanic lower soul and the higher soul and divine mind in order to gain providence to the divine being. These battle is not a battle of life and death, but about rulership. These two forces need to discover that they need to reconcile with each other, they will bring together in a harmonious balanced hierarchy the \"same and the other\" for the sake of unity. In the case of Odin his brother by blood-pact is Loke, his needed shadow, the clement of movement and change. The divine ambivalence is the key here. This same ambivalence we find in relation to Exu and the cult of Kiumbanda. These forces represent the shadow, the power of change and they are unpredictable. Their unpredictability is obvious when we see how many different opinions there are abollt these spirits. By confusion and disagreements they establish the path of pathc and forces one to a realization of the next stage. Those who fall in this process will suffer a lack of respect amongst these spirits and will continue to travel with pathc as their guiding light, in futile circles, reminiscent of Dantes journey. In a microscopic level, the ambivalence is within, and this is the true teaching of Exu, by resolving our conflicts and find peace with our inner demons we will resolve the ambivalent tension between \"same and other\" and avoid the dualist trap where something or someone need to be evil in the sense that it \\vorks against us and we will become kings and queens of the world of senses and fantasy. 36 "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"of Quite often we arc met \\Vith the label \"left hand\" or the \"darker side\" referring to the cult of Exu. at least in circles of Umbanda. Let us return to the mysteries of the left hand and look at just one of numerous examples illustrating the transformativc dement of one left hand character, Santa Clause. Lucifer set up his throne in the north. \\Ve read in Isaiah 14:13: \"I will exalt my throne ahove the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north\". The mystic Bonaventure gives the direction of Hell to be in the North. In orthodox kabbalah the north is associated with the Left side or the direction of the Beast and the bad seed of mankind. Ib utilize the left hand path in magic is considered to be a dangerous path associated with devilish influences. As we see in the biblical references to the two races of man. We find that Satanael placed his kingdom in the north. where we find the tree that gives knowledge to good and evil and the side associated with the seed of Cain where man and beast mingled. On the other side, the tree that hrings life where placed in the south and associated with the pure and innocent race of Abel and associated with the dextral or right side. We see this in the Latin \"Sinister\" as the word for left, which was the term used for the devil, but also for Santa Clause, whose original llame were Sinter Clause, or Nicholas the Sinister. Also Sinter Clause is associated with the north and travels in the night. The devil wears red, as Sinter Clause and he goes down the chimneys and get colored with sooth an thus turns into the Sooth Black man of the Sabbath, in the line of Cain, the instigator of witch-blood. Food, wine and sweets arc left for him in order to sweeten the Sinter Clause of which we have the nick name Old Nick as a term for the deviL The same offerings arc used in the cult of Exu. Sinter Clause left nuts, fruits and other gifts tndicative of his association with fertility. We have now moved into the mind of the Medieval \\Vorld, where we find the first traces of a coherent demonology and a greater interest in the enemy of Christ, by defining the devil and his legions. As in the case with Nicholas the Sinister we speak about unpredictability and fertility. Today he is the King of Christmas, depicted as a grandfather especially fond of children and brings gifts by obligation. It is this process of change that is signified by Exu, a power needed in order to create movement, change and \"progress\" in the world. Transformation and movement is the result of sensualism and desire, sexuality and attraction. And this is the domain of Exu and Pomba Gira - the world of sex and senses. And nothing is more rdated to sin and guilt, fa,cination and misuse than sex and certainly a deity rdated to pleasure will from a Christian point of view be considered as representing the 37"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"other side\". Sexuality, night and north arc the adversary to celibacy, day and the fiery south. The misconceptions ofsexuality started in a \\vay with Pope Urban lIs ban of marriage for priests in 1095 came to fruition in the decades following, reaching its zenith in the Medieval Age. The devil is no longer only material and a power that play tricks with our senses -but he rides at night with his host of demonized beasts as a villain from Hen so~ing discord and agony. He lurks around in the night and his virile aspects are emphasized. Not only is he transformation, danger and ambivalence, but he indulges in the pleasures of the flesh. His people are initiated by means of sexual orgia and sensualism. Codes of good behavior related to the Christian ideals of ascetic behavior surfaced. The notion of celibacy being a ward against satanic domination and a condemnation ofthe kingdom ofthe senses took rapidly form. Every impulse from the world of matter and senses should be duly exorcised. It should be mentioned here that the word exorcism is from the Greek exorkizo which allude \"to secure by oath\" or can also mean \"to ask or pray deeply\", from the root horkos meaning simply \"oath\". One form ofexorcism widely used by the Medieval clergy was \"exsufflation\", to breath upon the forehead of the afflicted one to dispel the negative forces. Not exactly the same meaning as we find today, where exorcism refers to dispelling some hostile force. This little detail is interesting for our study since it simply turn upside down the whole notion ofdispelling evil by using the formulae of exorcism in any other way than binding the impure element by oath. Certainly it also hint towards the pacts made with the devil actually was an idea coming from the Church it self by their practice of exorcism. Rather it hints to the infamous practice of making pacts \\vith infernal entities. This commentary is also crucial in order to understand the influence and usc of grimoires stemming from the Medieval and Renaissance Age in the practice ofKiumbanda. This often confuses seekers in modern day, simplv because there is tendency in the modern age to approach everything from a personal view and neglect the context. One can not understand the grammars ascribed to King Solomon, Verum and other such work without understanding the world that gave birth to them. Today the grammars of the art to often turn into diabolic exercises by their relation to demonic and infernal entities which £II to easy turn into vulgar satanism and other similar foolish approaches. One such matter often met with bias, distortion and downright stupidity is the mystery of Lucifer. 3H"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"dcvilhh Cl:nter of the Cosmos. The Mystery of Lucifer and his cosmological placement is perhaps better set forth by the famous mystic and poet Dante (1265-1321) in his Divine Comedy. There are certainly many aspects of Dante that could be discusses, but we need to limit ourselves to Dantes organization of the Cosmos and the position of Satan in Creation. We will find that at the center ofthe Cosmos the devil rests. This is in harmony with the Bogomil heresy that assumes the central importance of Satanael as the creator of Cosmos. There should not be any controversy in this regard. The powers of the north can very well situate them selves in the center. North as the gateway to the hidden powers, to the realm of death and coldness, the concealed mysteries are quite proper for the gnosis expounded upon in this book - as is the central position of SatanaeL Dante was influenced by the Augustinian idea that everything in the cosmos had a naturally drift either towards \"God\" or the \"Devil\". Our true human nature would always elevate us in the direction of God. But when we are motivated by desire and illusion we fall to the other pole. God is expansive and the Devil is nothingness, the great contraction, darkness and dark emotions. God is enlightenment and absence ofdarkness. Dantes travel to the heart ofthe Devils kingdom is firstly an allegory ofthe human battle against our lower self and also it gives an account of the journey Jesus Christ done in his three days of death. The interesting with Dante as with all neo-platonists are the attempts of separation in spite of the philosophko-Iogic unity that are present in the way of thinking. In Dantes case the paradox becomes evident when he sees that he is placing the devil and his hell at the center of cosmos. The conflict is here in relation to the position of God, whom he sees as the moral center of the cosmos. Since moral can not have a fixed center but embraces and penetrates all things, so God embraces all and we are left with a defense for the devils role and function instead of the opposite. Russell quotes Frerecco in this regard and says that: \"Satan is the \"center of the physical world and beyond the outermost circumference of the spiritual world\", but God is \"at the center of the spiritual world and is the circumference of the spiritual\" (Russell 1985: 219). It remains that the one partake in the realm of the other and completes each others opposition. It also makes sense in regard the northern placement of the devil and his placement in the center of the material world. It seems that the crux lies in our tendency of either aspire to \"God\" or to the \"Devil\", but this dual aspiration is a challenge none of us are spared for, even Jesus Christ went through his ordeal when he descended to Hell for three nights and three days. In the end we find 39"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"more that the Aristotelian law of physics, where equal produces similarity. This seems to be more the nature of the idea of the placement of Exu in cosmos, as a spirit partaking of all things material, as the centre of the sensible creation. For Dante the fall of Lucifer happened in the southern pole of Jerusalem, causing the dry land to retreat to the northern hemisphere and the south being filled with water -with the exception of a deep cavern that paved the way to the center of the earth. This fall could perhaps better be understood metaphorically as a fall that is affecting all mankind. In the heart ofour matter the devil fell through our flesh and blood and made his kingdom within us. The waters and dry land as metaphors for flesh and emotions can be seen as the devils playground amongst the humans today -where desire and emotional states are the weakest points of the human make up. It is also these sensible channels where we can open up for divine impulses and seek union with our higher self. The Greek philosophers saw the importance of guidance on this path -and the guidance was accomplished by ones \"daimon\". We could understand this term in ways of a daimon being similar to those of benevolent jinns, particularly good willed towards the philosopher or mage under their supervision. Like Exu, the daimons were understood to be ambivalent spirits. Often said to be earthbound and a source for teachings as well as guidance according \\vith ones Fate or Destiny. Due to the nature of Exu I would suggest to look at these spirits as if they are similar to daimons or djinns. Doing this we will fare much better in our trafficking with them. By meeting them in this way we will both understand the dual attraction as well as be able to bring harmony to our \"lower\" and \"higher\" souL They are forces of movement, ordeal and challenge and all this we need in order to understand, grow and become wise. They give blessings and curses, but the ultimate is neither of these, but the understanding arising and in such way turn everything into a blessing. This is the important function that Exu holds. Exu is point of merging between the oppositions within. Like the devil, Exu is the one who questions and challenges our motives and reasons and forces us to go deep in our self to seek wisdom and truth. Often this truth we hide is the truth about our self, our motives and reasons. Just as Dantes placement of Hell is at the center of the material with the protecting circle offire surrounding it, so it is with our own Hell situated in the center ofour flesh, it is always there and just as we have a constant access to the infernal kingdom we do also have a constant access to the empyrean kingdom. It is our own infernal and celestial decent the Devil teaches us to chose and transcend. With this in mind we should be well armed in our further travel on this path that cuts both ways, within our selves as well as to the outside. 40 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Three I\\,mba The iconography of Pomba Gira draws heavily on sexuality, prostitution and lustfulness. She can be either a woman of the street or of the aristocracy. She is usually exposing her breasts and/or displaying proudly her firm and sensual body, in a way that celebrates the womanhood in all its sensual and sexual pride. She is the seductress, the whore, the mother. the witch, the best of friend and the worst of enemy. She is woman and witch. Both to the most full extent of the words. Usually she is presented as the wife of Exu - as Exua or Exu-woman - as the \"Devils Lover\" and wife. She delights in the pleasures of the flesh, in challenging the weaknesses and obscure desires of her people, especially by sexually means provoking reactions, in order for growth and overcoming to occur. She prefers fine cigars, sweet wine and champagne. Jewelry, roses and sweet incenSL' arc amongst her favored delights -and most of all, she likes men. Most practitioners would agree in this, that Pomba Gira seems to favor men, but the reasons for this is not all that dear cut. I would suggest that Pomba Gira by being tbe fullness of womanhood is paying a great attention to men in order for them to change their perspectives of the female p(Hn:rs. It can be perceived as a way to dominate and awaken a different kind ofconsciousness amongst men especially in male and macho dominated cultures. ThL' usual opinion is that Pomba Gira favors men due to her whorish nature. I would say that sllch opinion is to he missing the whole point and he led astray by her seductive form. Pomba Gira is perhaps better viewed as the revolt against the modern society, the denial of culturally imposed moral and ethic values as well as a revolt against the common accepted rules of behavior that enchain woman in the role of a virgin, instead of celebrating her free spirit. She is hetter understood as a free woman, a woman of the world that thrives upon the pleasures and ordeals of carnal life. The challenges we meet as humans in this incarnation. It is this aspect that resulted in her popularity. She understands the human condition so very wel1, \\vhich turns her into the best of friends. In the giras (feasts) of EXll and Pomba Gira, when she comes down and possess her worshippers, she always give good counsel about the everyday problems of men and women, especially problems related to ones love 41"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"life. Her sensual approach both makes people feel embraced by love as well as being scared by her provocative attitude. She can make people feel that they are attractive and it also serve as a challenge. The challenge she represents is whether we manage to see beyond the sensual and provocative form she display and realize the wise woman within. Simply, do we see her for what she truly is or do we see only the masque? She is truly the wise woman using this form as a mirror of your own depth. Her form is that of a laughing, vulgar harlot and surely it can deceive the people in her presence. But if we look closer on her pont05 riscados (songs) maybe we can understand more of this enigmatic Lady. In one of her songs we sing the following: Eu sou Pombu, Gira, E vim Iml trabaliwr, Sou mulher dm Sete Exus, E wdo 0 mill vou levur, Eu tenlw uma Ruinha, E ten/lO tumbcm um rei. Translation: ram Pomba Gira I came 10 work I am the wife uf Seven And all evil! take with me 1huve u Queen And 1 have a/so a King We see here that she is the wife of seven Exus, and also that she have both a Queen and a King. Immediately it can advocate some sort of frivolity and promiscuity, but this song carry references both to the dual nature of Pomba Gira, as the servant of the Queen as well as the King, meaning woman and man. As will be evident through this grammar we will also see how it carry references to her human incarnation as well as to her multiple domains. The phrase saying that she is married to seven Exus, refers to her being the true power behind all the Exus, seven being the sacred number of Exu. This reference does not indicate that she is an insufferable nymphomaniac but that she is related powerfully to the total array of Kiumbandas powers, as another song goes: Na fam£lia Ja Pumbu Gira, 5() 5e mete quem puder, Ela eMaria Padilha, 42"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"A mulher de Lttcifer. Translation: In rhe family of Pomba Gira Just those wh() can dea.l dares to enter She is 1\\1aria Padi/ha The wife o[ Luci[er She is the wife of Lucifer the song says and this bring to our attention especially two goddesses, Lilith and Ashmodeus. We will after tracing the historical Maria Padilha, which is one of the more famous and powerful of the Pomba Giras, look closer on the mysteries of Lilith and Ashmodeus as well as Salome in order to make more sense of who this enigmatic Lady truly is and what she is capable of. Maria Padilha seems to have been a real person, lover of the Spanish King Pedro 1 of Castilha (1334 -69). The story is quite sad with its drama of violence and, sex and seduction. The story tells of a powerful woman who manipulated the death of her rivals and also of a king more sinister than her self that was referred to as Pedro the Cruel. \\Vithin all the sadness we find a great love story, and upon the death of Maria Padilha King Pedro I of Castilha did not only made for her a mausoleum in Sevilla (which was about to be the royal centre) but also recognized her as his Queen. She had three children by the king, but all of them died before reaching adolescence. Maria Padilha also influenced characters of romances weaving dramas of witchcraft and romantic disappointment and troubadours composed serenades inspired by her legend and history. The many rct\"erences to Pomba Gira, and especially the Pomba Gira knmvn as ~hria Padilha, and her royal status is undeniably very present in the historical notes related to King Pedro I and his court. Another feature of interest is how Maria PaJilha became associated with European \\Vitchcraft, especially related to the circle of Witches of Evora in Portugal. The Holy Office in Valencia came into pm,session of numerous conjurations of Jevilish forces. Amongst the many accounts there arc especially one which was received in 1655 that arc of particular interest for this study. Here we find the following conjuration noted down: CUHjurtl'... C()n BLlrruhds.

Luisa Maria were utilizing folk magic spells rdated to facilitate lovemaking by calling all these forces mentioned in the satanic conjuration from 1655 in Spain. Also in Portugal in 1662 we find the Inquisition collecting the testimony of Manuela de Jesus who is referring to the usc of Maria Padillha in the same satanic context and for the same ends. Lastly in the testimony of Maria de Seixas in 1673 we find Maria Padilha referred to as a vulto, meaning \"entit)''' or \"spirit\". In those years, most witches found guilty in intercourse with the devil either physically or mentally by the Holy Office in Portugal were often exiled to Brazil who used to have the more proper name as Santa Cruz and Vera Cruz due to its position under the constellation of the Crux. The connection this constellation bas witb Venus can maybe be taken into consideration given the uniquely Venusian atmosphere that is lingering around in Brazil even today. The iconography of Maria Padilha was passed on historically in Brazil as well. It is almost like the history repeats it self in regard the mistress of Don Pedro I, emperor of Brazil in the time of Jose Bonifacio (between 1830 - 50) in rdation to Maria Padilha and the Spanish King Pedro l. The mistress ofDon Pedro I was a woman by birth called Domitila de Castro (born in Siio Paulo on the 27'h of December 1797). She was later raised to the aristocracy and assumed the name Marquesa de Santos. In intimate letters to his mistress Don Pedro I referred to himself as her \"big demon\". The relationship was explicitly open and acknowledged by all and Don Pedro even had three of his many children with the Marquesa de Santos. The Man-luisc her self conceived fourteen children in all and Don Pedro I even had a child with a nun in a monastery in PortugaL Just to point out the highly sexual nature of these two lovers relationship. To sec Don Pedro I as yet another representative of the devilish icon of Exu and the Marqucsa as a representative of Pomba Gira is not difficult. In fact, it is strange that the Marquesa de Santos has not been granted a place in the fold of Pomba Giras in a common accepted level amongst her devotees as an Exu woman - especially considering the highly sexual and diabolic nature of their relationship, both between the two lovers and 44 "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"f also in relation to Brazilian politic. De Santos was a great critique of the hero of independence, Jose Bonifacio. Actually the force and int1uence of the Marquisa reminds of another Pomba Gira, Maria Quiteria that was intluential in the war of independence in Bahia. They both were Capricorn with Leo rising, a powerful combination for a woman and in many cases this aspect contrihuted to make them int1uential in politic and seduction, also Eva Peron had this powerful Saturn-Sol aspect in her chart and her fame and int1uence reached further than Argentina. Witchcraft was a hot topic in the 17th Century and in the case of Portugal we find the famous circle of witches in Evora that some says where a nucleus for the Portuguese witches and also the circle that educated Maria Padilha in the arts. The witches of Evora were said to work both with kabbalah and folk magic, the production of philters and trafficking with the Devil in the Aquilarre or the Sabbath. It is also said in the grimoire of SilO Cypriano that the witches of Evora were teaching the priest to become the lcgnedary St. Cypriano the infernal arts. Legend tells that Sao Cypriano used to be a sorcerer and necromancer before he was ordained to priesthood. The grimoire suggest that he did this in order to work the Black Arts undisturbed from the paranoid and suspicious gaze of the Vatican. Another important int1uence can also be traced if we turn to the romances and poetry of the 14'11 Century. Especially intluential were Fernando Rojas and the publication nfhis romance \"La Celestina\" in Spain 1499. The book about Celestina is a classical romantic love story between ayoung couple meeting hindrances when they try to live their love. They young couple arc using the cunning Celestina as their intermediary and it all ends in death and despair. Celestina is formed in the classical shape of a witch. She makes divinations, she makes philters and she is a midwife. Most of all she do what she can to help people in difficult situations in life, but still she is also eviL She becomes the victim of the bloodthirsty mob when the young couple secrets are revealed. Rojas portrayed Celestina as manipulative and deceitful, with a slippery tongue and a wicked mind. But at the same time this figure is extremely ambiguous, veiled in sweetness and romance wickedness and dread alike. In many ways, Rojas managed to catch the double nature of the witch in his book, the nature we recognize in Pumba Gira who can do both good and eviL The book became very popular and retained its popularity for the next two hundred years or so and probably it intluellced the ideas people held about witches to a great extent. She was wicked, wild, obscure and beautiful -and not to forget, female. Just like the Pomba Gira in the cult of Kiumbanda. 45"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"\\Ve have another route of influence that need to be discussed. Again we return to what is referred to as Congo-faiths or more correctly as Candomble of Angola. Candomble de Angola focus on Nkisis, the Bantu term for spirits. Here we have a spirit by the name Bombogira that are syncretized with the devil and the devil in turn is by some syncretized with Exu in the reflection of Candomble known as Nag6. Bombogira is referred to amongst the adherents ofCandomblc of Angola as a deity that can be either male or female. And probably the Congolese descendents saw in their homely devil similarities in the deity whom the exiled witch Antonia Maria called \"\\Vitchmother\", namely Maria Padilha. Exu had already taken the phallic position, and with the devilish andro6'Ynous spirit called Bombogira it did not turn out to be a problem to assume the role of the fearsome wife of the devil. Amongst the Bantus deified ancestors are central for the cult. The revitalizing ofthe physical bones and bringing back the essences of the one who once carried these bones within his or her flesh is a common feature of these mysteries as they have been transmitted in Palo Mayombe. Po mba Giras like Maria Padilha, Maria Mulambo, Maria Quitcria and many others went through the same process. The once living persons become spirit and subject for petition, much like the catholic saints. All of them were said to be free and seductive women with a strong will. These were all models of the female power, women that took their will and fill of all pleasures, whether they be noble or poor. Most Pomba Giras is conceived of as poor, only Maria Padilha is said to have been of noble heritage. \\Ve also have the connection with Pomba Giras and gypsies. This is probably because the gypsies association with witchcraft or mirongas as spell craft is also referred to. The Gypsies are sometimes called Mirangas. In one calling to Satamis and Maria Padilha in 17th Century Portugal it is clearly made a reference to her being a gypsy and the ritual involve offerings to Cain as welL Many gypsies consider themselves to be the children of Cain and from the perspective of a practitioner of the wise craft it all makes more sense than one could imagine. Pomba Gira comes in many forms. We have already mentioned a few famous Po mba Girth and we can also name; Pomba Gira Cigana Salome, Pomba Gira da Praia, Pomba Gira Menina, Pomba Gira Dama de Noite and Pomba Gira Rosa Caveira. All ofthem are expressions of the same fundamental proto-witch, with specific orientations and specialties.

Pomba Gira, like Exu can work good and bad. They are dual or ambivalent, which made the Muslim witches, mde to see the correspondence between Pomba Gira and EXll and their own jinns who they cultivated on Friday, a day auspicious for Pornba Gira (Meyer 1993). The discussion on the relation between Exu and jinns has already been presented and this observation made by Meyer build up under Ollr hypothesis of the true nature of these spirits being dairnons or jinns. Pomba Gira is truly an nfuri or egun (disincarnated spirit), but her reflection can be found in deities like Lilith, Ashmodeus and Salome. I say reflection, as the contents in this chapter aims toward giving an understanding of Pomha Gira and her nature on basis of already existing legends and wisdom, not making parallels that calls for identification with any other spirit. Salome was the stepdaughter of Herod that demanded the head of St. John the Baptist on a plate in return for her (or as some interpreters say~ her daughters) lap dancing. This makes St. John the Baptist a type of adversary to this mystery, and therefore intimately and importantly related to this hidden and veiled secret behind Pomba Gira. Salome have been linked with the Queen of Sheba and the Queen ofSheba has in turn heen connected to Lilith and Kaa'mah in various ways. The connection with Ashmodells is coming through Venus of which we can say Aphrodite is the henevolent rd1cction. The connection with Ashmodeus and Ursa Major is also of importance to note. Let us look more in depth 47"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"of Lilith, Asmodeus and Salome, which we can consider to be our Trinity or threefold lunar vibration into Hag, Mother and Virgin. The dlmpurity We are now deep into the European mysteries of Pomba Gira. She her self is a true witch, born in the line of Cain, holding the seed of her true origin, Lilith in her blood and being. The many Pomba Giras that lived on earth are those who by affinity joined into this realm of consciousness upon death and decided to stay close to humans for aid, help, support and restoration of wisdom by the means of challenges. The demonification happened because the mystery is difficult to penetrate and understand. How can Wisdom be a Wore we might ask? And the answer is: by the same reasons and ways that Sophia, the Wise Gnostic principle earned her epitaph prunikos, meaning harlot. Demons are usually recognized by harboring a desire towards earth, a decent down instead of a stable fixation in the point of pleromic bliss. Also the demonic impulse is known by the desire of procreation instead of sterility.

It is the corrupted man that through profane eyes sees only a whore where he should see \\visdom crowned and blessed. The Myths of Lilith arc many and always horrid. She is a vampire, a strangler of children, a man-cater and a man-hater. An abomination in the eyes ofGod, something dangerous that was expelled to the Red Sea and even when expelled she was considered so dangerous that God sent three angels to make a truce with her. And yes, she is dangerous. As the spouse of Lucifer in Latin sorcery as for instance in the secret cults ofStregoneria she is considered to be intoxicating and devastating. The great Master Fulvio Rendhell simply refers to Lilith as \"the cosmic terrorist\". Lilith has been the subject for much interest, both in regard to her astrological and psychological importance. Both speak about the shadow side or darker side ofthe human psyche or sexuality. The position ofones Lilith or black moon in ones natal chart speaks about ones true sexuality and darker tendencies, what we arc capable ofin relation to sex and violence. It accordingly speaks about those tendencies that we suppress because of the conventions of 48 "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"society. Society makes us feel ashamed ofcertain forms of sexual behavior. Lilith is a revolt against this and says instead: \"with how many as pleases me in whatever circumstances that pleases me and in what ways it pleases me I will take my fill of Love!\" These basic impulses that are displayed by Pomba Gira are originally coming from Lilith. Since she is related to sexual appetites we try to suppress she also relates automatically to other types of suppression such as shame, guilt, feelings of inferiority, unfairness, sadism and submission. On this psychological level, Liliths teaching is a call for being who we arc and renounce shame, guilt and restraint given to us by society. And I would like to emphasize this idea, that she is a revolt against society. In our age when the Jungian archetypes and Freudian neurosis is to be found anywhere we tend to make our psychological make reflecting a belief in the existence of seedy secret vaults of suppressed tendencies connected to archetypes of whatever deep nature possible. In doing this, we forget the extent of social influence, how civilizations and societies carry rules, laws and assumptions that shape us into conformity with the given sociery. In this we find Liliths revolt. Her gospel is rather one of bringing our body, mind and strength to the limit of any possibility so we can see who we are and stand strong in her, rather than fall under her lash as a slave for our own dark fantasies and urges. \\Vhen we understand how techniques for body and sexuality are inherited through culture and how this in turn has shaped us we will start to understand the vastness of Liliths revolt. Through this we will understand Pomha Giras revolt as well. They have the same sinister reputation and they object to the same system, the system that shapes you into something different than what you are and forces you to take on a masque alien to your self. Another deity we mentioned was Ashmodeus. We find this deity mentioned both in the Testament of Solomon, in the apocryphal Book of u)hit and in the solomonic grimoire known as Legemeton and a few other place~ like de Plancys Dictionnaire Infernal. Ashmodeus is known by many names, Asmodee, Chammadai and Sydonai being a few of them. The root it self seem to be related to Asherah, the bride of Jalweh, that were worshipped widely in the ages before the monarchs ofIsrae\\, actually it and wise spirits. The qualities of her parents were t10wing strong and fiery in her veins by this first incest. The third women in this crooked trinity arc Salome.

It is suggested that she danced for the king in a sensual belly dance, which ended with her pleasing the king in more direct sexual ways. The Salome that danced for Herod is according to some nameless mystical traditions the Queen of Sheba or Lilith her self coming down in this shape of \"the impure Virgin\" that relates her with Ashmodeus. Most commentators of the Bible stress that the Salome that danced for King Herod and the Salome that watched Jesus Christ die together with Mary the Magdalene and later participated in his embalming are two different women. Considering our previous comment of St. John the Baptist role as the adversary of this mystery it makes perfect sense that on some level these two Salomes can be understood to be the same woman. First Salome ensures that the prophet and opener of the gates submit to her desire and will and then she make sure than the man whom St. John opened the gate for makes a proper decent to the infernal regions. This role is necessary and unpopular, like the role of Judas lskariotes in this drama of redemption and mystery. In Kiumbanda the infernal kingdom is considered to be at the left hand ofgod, not in opposition toJesus Christ who represents the right hand of God, but complimentary. The need for upholding a balance between the kingdoms is stressed amongst many Umbandistas and Kimbandistas. Ifyou want to work the left side, you also need to wok the right side, in order to avoid falling into spiritual corruption. The crucial point is that we must avoid becoming slaves of our satanic impulses and allow our self to be guided by the higher self, the divine mind. Such considerations are 50 "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"important to meditate upon in order to understand Pomba Gira. As we have seen, Maria Padilha was related to mysteries of witchcraft biased by satanism. She is intimately rdated to the drama or mystery surrounding St. John the Baptist and Jesus the Christ as the one playing out the effects of betrayal, death and sacrifice. Salome seem to have been quite intimate with Mary the Magdalene, the wife ofJesus the Christ and just by assuming this we will hint to yet deeper mysteries that will lure us back to Ashmodeus or rather Ashtarte which Ashmodeus probably is related to. if not actually a corruption of the very same. Ashtarte or Ishtars decent to the infernal regions of Ereshkigal or Hell is a story about sacrifice and duty. About overcoming and alignment ofones dark side in order to make possible ones ascent, reminiscent ofDante's Virgil who mirrored Jesus the Christ's own painful passage towards knowledge and redemption. These are the teachings Pomba Gira gives to her devotees, hidden within her iconography. By the use of vulgarism, blasphemy and temptation she lures you into the recognition of who you are by the path ofconstant ordeal. On this road she is constantly resting in the darkness, waiting and observing. It is in these domains we find the unpleasant reputation of pacts with the devil always resulting in dire consequences contrary to the divine order. It is a result of our lack of understanding of the sinister mysteries. It is the unwillingness offacing the ordeal and resistance ofchange that forces man to create the devil in the image of hideousness and disgust. We are thus projecting our own inferiority and refusal of recognizing our sinister side on the devil, as tempter and adversary. As the foul one leading us astray. not realizing that the path astray is perhaps the one path that leads to the heart of all. 51"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"ng~ Red Room This chapter is separated into three sections representing three different grimoires or grammars, which explain how to enter into contact and consequently work with these deities. The first grammar deals with the basic forms of Exu as they find expression under the command of Exu Rei and the one direct in command, Lucifer. They are mostly related to natural and counter-natural phenomena. The second grammar is related to the mystery of death and the powers of the cemetery and the night, disclosing the procedures and protocols of working with these spirits. The third grammar belongs to Pomba Gira and will give a detailed account of various works concerning her and also some legends and myths about how she becamc thc mistress of \"the Devil\". These grammars attempt to present Kimbanda/Kiumbanda in a form as pure as possible, and accordingly only the most traditional Exus and Pomba Giras have been discussed. There are many, many others, as will be demonstrated towards the end of the book, where arc shown the dynamics of Kiumbanda and the growth of the legions of Exu, as well as the segmentation of the legions to different Hank, and troops. I also intended to include a fourth grammar in this book, but Exu removed this text. This grammar will be published in the future, if the spirit so desires. But for now, it remains a burning coal hidden within the concealed \\vings of the Dragon Exu. Let it also be said that the fourth grammar contains the secrets that haw shaped the perception of Kiumbanda evident in this book, and as such, one can see this book as an attainable reflection of the secret itself. The members of The Brotherhood of the Red Room try to maintain pure Kimbanda/Kiumbanda without intervention of any other systems, whether nkisi or orix{\\. Uncritical syncretism is avoided and a way of working which does not rely on using supportive systems from other adjoining cults and religions is sought. This way we work according to the principles of license and bring in only what are natural allies for these spirits, or what has been proven effective in the course of its practice. This means that in some instances Ogllm and Oxala have been used to restore harmony in situations that have tended to get out of hand. Also, intervention from saints and nkisi has occurred in the past, as has"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"intervention from Ogum, both in order to hring a stronger manifestation of presence and also to set boundaries. It cannot he stressed enough that Kiumbanda is not a homogenous system adhering to one set formula. Each terrciro or temple represents a variation of Kimbanda and thus in time becomes a unique expression of these powers. Most terreims work in ways coloured by Umbanda or Candomb16, whereas Kimbanda is often considered to reside on the \"left side\". In the case of the Red Room, we try to work in as pure a manner as possible, by adhering to both the European aspects ofPomba Gira's heritage in Kimbanda, and the Congolese sorcery represented by many Exus. There is no right or wrong context (religiously speaking) of working with Exu, but the way is only one, and concerns license and understanding. Unlicensed working with these spirits comes with a price - as docs foolishness. It should also be said that to work with these spirits without support from a conjoining system or faith presents an almost inhuman stress on body and soul, an impact that needs to be taken into account by one wanting to wander within the kingdom of earth and fire on the premises suggested in this book. Trance states, dreams, possession, songs, vibration, recitation, arc all ways of using words and imagination to enter into contact with the spirits. All of these ways are equally good. Just because songs are more usual in African worship does not mean that songs are always better than ceremonial recitation and call to the spirit. In some parts of the rites of Pomba Gira, the spirit is called by the use of the Latin language, resulting in possession. Songs and vibration both activate a strong sympathy between the summoner and the spirit, and one is of course advised to use these traditional ways of spirit-contact as the results tend to be more immediate and rapid. In these grammars the traditional pontos cantados (songs) and pontos riscados (signature) are given for almost every Exu and Pomba Gira, with the exception of the more obscure ones that deliberately arc excluded for various reasons. Many prayers and formulae that have proven useful in the work done in the Red Room are here presented as tools for establishing contact with the spirits. The songs are presented in Portugut'se as it is the sacred language of these spirits, along with Bantu dialects. The classification ofspirits pertaining to each of these three gram­mars is segmented as follows: In the first grammar the supreme legions will be discussed. These spirits are ruled by Exu Rei, usually referred to as The Maioral. This line of spirits is important, !-,>1ven their dose relationship with Lucifer, the first in command. Often Exu Rei and Lucifer are confused with each other, while the reality is that Exu Rei is a composite of divine fire of an angelic 56 "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"nature, usually fronted by the archangel Michael, but also Auriel is related to Exu Rd. This is a part of an esoteric s;:cret that will not be revealed in its fullness. In the case of Exu, you will also note that daimonic names from Grimorium Verum have been added to the names of Exu in most cases. This means that EXLI can in certain instances be worked on a more esoteric level by using the kabbalistic signatures for spirit-congress. This is considered a more balanced avenue for interacting with Exu, in accordance with the nature of the grimoire itself. As already remarked in the second chapter, there is a misunderstanding surrounding what is commonly referred to as demons, seen in the context of the grimoires from the late medieval times. Emphasizing the satanic component takes one a big leap towards the pit of mistake and confusion. On the contrary, we are here speaking about ethereal spirits offire that thrive in the terrestrial domain. It is their proximity and ability to influence that creates the diabolic aura surrounding them. This makes them very workable, very ambiguous, very understandable to the human condition -and also quite dangerous. This class of spirit easily gives and easily takes, and many people overlook an important factor in their work with Exu, namely the demand of personal growth that lies implicit in the nature of this system. The usual idea about growth and evolution b that the Exus are the ones in need of evolution but I would suggest the opposite. We arc the one~ who, through these >pirits, should seek to attain to the summit of the knowledge they are willing to inspire in us, focllsing on our growth on this dual-bladed path they present to the adherents of the cult. It is an endless path of ordeal and challenge, constructed to forge one's stamina, heart and mind ~ it is the seat of magic. In the fold of Exu and Pomba Gira we find the red djinns walking the black path towards the mountain of knowledge and in this lies secret, mystery and danger. In the second grammar, you wiII find information about the various Exus presiding over Death and how this mystery is related to phenomena of nature. The third grammar is dedicated to the Queen of Kiumbanda, the lovely and fascinating Pomba Gira. The first grammar is called The Scroll Known as The Fall of the King and treats the mystery of Exu Luci­f~r and his many legions. The second grammar has been given the name The Seals of the Boneherd, due to its focus on the powers of death and th~ Lise of liminal states of being. The third and last grammar is called The Revelations of the Fallen Beauty and ties the mystery of Exu into a more Luciferian perspective by presenting the grimoire of the Queen of Kiumbanda. In the first grammar the classification of spirits following the mayoral contains two spirits under Lucifer's direct command, then two 57"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"spirits second in command and two spirits third in command. After that we have two distinctive Exus, each of whom is a captain of massive legion of Exus. These arc Exu Calunga and Exu Omolu. The subject of the first grammar is the line from Exu Rei, to Exu Lucifer, and onwards to the captain, Calunga. It is as follows: We have three different lines of Exus, connected Capeta thl' MahH'al Exu Llicifl'r 1st in command Put Satanakia ~ Exu lv1araho Agalil'raps ~ Mangul'ira Bdzd-ruh, Exu MOl' -2nd in command Tarchimachl' -Exu Tranca Run,., Sagathana - Exu Vdudn Ashtaroth, Rei Sete Encruzilhada 3de in command Fleurty ~ Exu Tiriri NeshinlS - Exu d, lS RillS Syt'ach - Exu Calunga Gnomo Calunginha to Lucifer, Beelzebub and Ashtaroth, In the line of Lucifer, we find that he is attended by Exu Mangueira and Exu Marab6 or Agaieraps and Put Satanakia, as they arc known as from the medieval grimoires. In the line of Beelzebub we find Exu TranGl Ruas and Exu Tiriri as his generals, also known as 1ilrchimache and Fleruty. The third line is ruled over by Ashtaroth, who is also known as Exu Rei das Sere Encruziladas, whose generals arc Exu Veludo and Exu dos Rios or Sagathana and Nesbiros. It also contains Klephot or Exu Pomba Gira. And yet we have another line in this hierarchy that is in the line of Ashtaroth but is ruled by Omolu and Exu Calunga, also known as Syrach. He has 18 legions of Exus under his command.

He is also referred to simply as the Maioral or Exu Rei, meaning King Exu. This is in many ways true -but not absolutely correct, since the mayoral, in reality, is none other than Archangel St. MichaeL This certainly suggests that a special dynamic is found between the t\\vo angels in relation to the kingdom of Exu that makes the distinction between the two blurred. Archangel Michael, who represents the spiritual fire of the heaven and the solar ability of overcoming, is together with the Lord of Earth, the archangel Lumiel, the angelic guardian of the many legions of spirits headed by Exu and Pomba Gira. C'apcta ­The importance of Lucifer is in any case so great that the first part of this grammar is E-,riven in the remembrance of the king who feU to earth. We are here confronted with a dilemma great and vast and quite undisclosed in the Grammars of the Art, usually subject to the E-,rreatest of confusion, misunderstanding and bias. The famous kimbandciro Aluizio Fontenelle referred to EXll Rei as the \"absolute\", the crowned powers of Exu and the sum of all evil. One is warned against working with him in a black magic context and if onc is supposed to work with him OIW should strive to usc the methods of high magic or kabbalah, to avoid the more hard and brutal manifestations of these powers. Interestingly, there is similarity in the use of the word kabbalah amongst the kimbandeiros in the '60s, especially in Rio de Janeiro, and amongst practitioners ofObeah, especially from Jamaica and Trinidad; in both cases the reference is to a form of high magic performed with low spirits. Let us follow the thread of Obeah a bit further, as it can bring more light on this complex iss lie. The focLis of the cult of Obeah is Papa Bones, similar in some ways to Omolu and the more serious members of the Ghuede family found in Haitian Vodou - given that he is often described and depicted as a cosmic skeleton. In Obeah, 61"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Papa Bones is understood to be a trickster spirit, hut he also has a darker counterpart, Sasahonsam, a monster from the forests in the kingdom of Ashanti. Sasabonsam and Papa Bones are the beneficial and malefic reflexes of the same form, and are as such suggestive of a model concerning the conflict inherent in the problem of Satan and Lucifer. The mechanisms are, of course, far deeper than this, since they rctlect the spiritual Jihad against our corruptive drives and desires. There is a conflict, hut a dynamic conflict, which is mirrored in the fight hetween the higher and lower soul attempting to take control ofour actions. It is we, man, who instigate the war between Satan and Lucifer. For those who are motivated hy satanic impulses, Exu turns into the devil; for those motivated by aspiration to the divine mind, Exu will turn into a powerful guardian and loyal friend, a manifestation of the \"Absolute\". The manifestation is related to the worshipper's constitution of soul and heart. As we have seen so far in this Grammar, the problem of evil is far more complex than the common distinction biased by Christianity separating the infernal and empyrean kingdom suggests. Let us recall that in the Bogomil heretics believed that God created Satanael from his shadow. It is important to note that the name of the angel who fell originally had the ending -e1, signifying his divine status as a son ofGod. Lucifer, Satanael and Satan are maybe better viewed as a tri-fold reflection of the King of Shadows himself. Lucifer represents the promethean factor introduced to the creation, the principle of movement, change and wisdom our higher soul, the divine reason or a vehicle for nous connecting us to all things in great harmony. Satanael, on the other hand, represents the bridge towards our lower nature, the deity of choice and the challenge that opens the possibility of entering within the kingdom of the emotional and ecstatic life that should ideally be subdued by the faculty of reasoning. If we allow our emotional life to assume the throne ofour being we easily fall into corruption, and instead of being kings and queens ofour domain, we tllrn into slavery and confusion. By crossing the bridge forged by Satanad, we turn our self into Satan, the exalted perversion of spirit with no recourse to the golden chain or light-seed of divine hecoming. In accordance with via negative, it is easy to become convinced that \"evil\" is the absence of God. And truly, we can agree that ahsence of the light-seed facilitates the corruption of mind, soul and heart, leading to a fall ofour mvn being towards matter, like Satanad when he lost his divine status and fell away from the source. The term Black Magic has a multitude of understandings and, true enough, all possible interpretations of Black I\\1agic can be validated in the realm of Exu, because we have the tri-fold segmentation of his realm: it 62"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"both represents a Mystery in itself-that we shall, for the time being, leave somewhat concealed and also, the fall and corruption man can bring upon himself. If we avoid keeping our nature high and our character good in our promethean pursuits, the balance between the sensual and intellectual world can collapse: we fall into Hell where Satan is the King, and we lose our serenity and mindfulness. Ultimate this leads to activities associated with Black Magic, in the sense of them being motivated by the corruption of the souL Such magical acts aim towards manipulating the will ofothers on the basis of satisfying the hunger and drives of the lower soul. This is negative magic and contradictory to the very essence of Lucifer himself. We must understand that Lucifer does not make choices on behalfof man, he represents an option, like Satan, and it is this paradoxical and intense contradiction which makes Kimbanda and Kiumbanda a path sharper than any blade. Contrasted with many other paths of magic and evolution, the danger of falling into corruption and insanity is more prominent. Calling Lucifer is very different from calling Satan. While Satan is working on our desires, urges and impulses by operating them in a hidden and perverse manner, Lucifer works on our higher mind. To connect with this force will often be dangerous to the unprepared mind, due to the immense pressure his nature represents. Even low levels of manifestation always involve serenity and purity of all possible forces earlier present in the temple. Everything is cleaned away to make room for just a small amount of this force. A manifestation of the fallen nature is not signified with the Luciferian dignity, which aims at re­embracing the divine fire. Worship at the table of Satan, where all vices and perversions are served in the halls ofHcll, is for those who see Exu as the portal to short-termed goals and direct all attention to the flesh and the immediate. By intricate mechanisms, Exu can ignite fire of the flesh and open lip the lahyrinths of our own lower soul with the same ease as the doors to the Jerusalem on high arc flung open for the seeker to see the glory of paradise. And in this lies the challenge. Exu Rei represents both your higher and lower aspirations to the fullness of their nature, and in this many Seekers go wild or resort to explanations based on biased dualism. This is again related to the reputation of the variolls Grammars of the Arte, slich as the Legemcton, ascribed to Salomon. The Grimoire ascribed to Honorius, the Black Pullet, and Grimorium Verum all have a sinister reputation. As the enlightened reader knows, this is far from the truth: here is another challenge fix the seeker presented by Hermes Trismegistus himself to sanctify the quest. However, these Grammars of the Arte can very wdllead one man to the regent of Hell, as they lead another to the King of Knowledge. They simply reveal the plain truth, that man himself is man's greatest enemy. The choice lies with the Pilgrim, not in the thorn­63"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"road of which the Grammars are the map. Most Grammars of the Arte assume that the summoner is ofa Christian orientation or at least a mystic, since this aspiration opens a dual way between the empyrean and infernal realms, enabling the magus to find balance between the kingdoms. Seen from such perspective, it is understandable that Christian-oriented gnosis is often prominent in the Grammars. Items sacred: Hyssop, Galbanum, all flowers that opens in the night.

Some suggest that his name means \"the Exu who protects his people\", but this is uncertain. He is also related to crossroad and to errant people and pilgrims.

MacGregor Mathers gives the following listing, from top to bottom. 1. Satan and Moloch 2. Beelzebub 3. Lucifuge 4. Ashtarot 5. Asmodeus 6. Belphegor 7. Baal 8. Andrammelech 9. Lilith 10. Naamah The interesting point to note here is that most of these deities represent the gods venerated by tribes that were in opposition to what came to be known as the Israelites. Moloch was a Canaanite god of fire. Asmodeus, a Persian spirit with close terrestrial connotations, was incorporated in the Jewish myths as an enemy of God. In the case of Belzebub, the probable origin is Bel-se-buth; or ultimately, the great rival ofJahveh, the Moabite god Baal Zebub or simply Baal, which was referred to as the adversary by ChassidicJews in the 18th Century. An argument may be presented against Belzebub being a demonic deity presiding over flies; this attribute may arise from confusion with some Mesopotamian fiend. 72"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"We find the same theme in Belphegor, which is probably a corruption ofBaal Peor, a good of licentiousness depicted in a form typical of the ithyphallic Priapus, a proper icon for the \"God of the Witches\". Andramclech is said to be brother of Asmodeus and his name means King of the Underworld. These few comments arc made to remind you, dear reader, ofthe complexity of the matter at hand. We also have a famous confession quoted by Richard Cavendish: the monkJean del Vaux confessed, without torture, that he and some other people worshipped Bclzebub in 1595 as their \"Grand Master\", which naturally brings to mind the accusations hurled at the Knights of the Temple. It seems that the icon of Bclzebub, \"Lord of Flies\", Prince of Seraphim and Daimon of the month ofJuly, in his ambivalence and capacity as a repository of the many gods that opposed Jahveh, can shed even more light on the nature of Kiumbanda and especially its rclation to European Witchcraft practices. Certainly great, arcane teachings related to the practice of the Knights of de Molay can be discovered with this Exu as one's guiding spirit.

U\\,.htawth) the SL'ven Cr,):-:,r<l,hl\" Ashtaroth is the King of the seven crossroads of power and a mighty general, third in command of the legions of Lucifer. Any road can close or open by the aid and interest ofthis Exu. This Exu is a gentle spirit, very similar to Lucifer in his ways and dominates the more aristocratic Exus. We meet him in Legemeton as an infernal duke and thus ascribed to Venus. He is said to have been a beautiful angel riding a dragon and commanding vipers. Some sources claim that he is originally a Syrian god, probably because of the connection with Ashtor or Astarte, Venus, or Ishtar who is of a Syrian origin. In the Bible she is referred to as a deity worshipped by the Zidonians (Le. Phoenicians). Associated with fertility, she would belong to Moon, but other factors indicate that she would be more connected to Venus. Assuming that this theory ofevolution is correct, we find an interesting parallel with Kiumbanda insofar as the dual-sexed deities arc concerned. Ashtaroth, the embodiment of beauty, King of the Seven Crossroads, will reveal all things past, present and future, and can teach any natural science. 74 "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Pontos Cantados of Exu das Sere Encruzilhadas Ah, Exu, Ah Extl King ()f the Crossroads (Jf the W1r;rlJ Ail EXll, Ah Exu Struck with Beauty Ah Exu, Ell Exu With Thy Breath make the Crossroads wme alive Ah EXH, Ell, Exu Exu of the Seven Crossroads Come to my aid as I beg your /;resenee Ail £Xu, Ell Exu euras do .'leu Sere Encruzillwdas 1cm uma bdeza rum oseu Sete wme\\a, aunde u medicina /)(im Mus de cum me5nw, curu 5iHl senhor Mas de eura meSl1W, am fillws seus tvlt' curu .'leu Sete, {do arn()r de Deus Me cura seLL Sete, lic/() <tHlnr de Deus.

He is also good to use for purposes of divination and has a great understanding and compassion for human misery. He is said to be of a black hue and have unpleasant features, but is gentleman in all his ways. He is a womanizer and a great mediator between the various kingdoms of power. He can very well be applied in works concerning relationships, clandestine, or those suffering from problems, or external abuse and suppression. This is perhaps linked to a legend telling that Tiriri had an incarnation in Ireland, where he seduced the daughter ofa wealthy man, who despised the womanizer Tiriri and made sure that he suffered for conquering his daughter. All kinds of degradation and maltreatment of body and face were imposed upon the handsome womanizer until he finally died of the abuse. Accordingly, he can he med with great efficiency in works of destruction, especially in cases of ahuse. He is reputed to bring with him his ally Exu Tranca Ruas in powerful workings, to take people to their eternal and permanent ruin. It is also important to point out that this Exu may originate in Oyo state, Nigeria, given the prominence of this Exu in traditional houses of Orixa worship in Bahia with roots in Oyo state. Exu Tiririr is a carefree and gentle spirit, who usually manifests in a calm way and with the temperament of a warrior; this is the basis for one of the most forceful and enigmatic protectors amongst the legions of Kiumbanda.

His relation to the depths of the Ocean links him with the powers of mermaids and sirens; sailors who died at sea enter his legions. The depths of the ocean represent mystery and secrecy, and in the case of Calunga they are intertwined with death. Calunga is mostly used in works dealing with dead sailors and spirits of the ocean, both in works of great healing and also to create emotional disturbance in the victims of his rage.

Also it is amongst these legions that we find the highest numher of spirits and can also encounter a great diversity, given the role Omolu play in relation to the seven lines of Kiumbanda. For now it shall suffice to say that the int1uence from the seven lines constitutes a more rich and varied legions of Exu, bringing in spirits from all over the world and of many various kinds. Omolu is a red robed skeleton holding a small coffin in his hands. He is originally a Nigerian deity from the southern districts, worshipped amongst the Ibo and not the Yoruba. With time his cult entered some Yoruba families where he has a similar role as what have become typical in Kiumbanda, that Omulu is an important deity for the execution of the cult. It would also be proper to point out that the common association between Omolu and Obaluwaye being the same is more or less correct. We can say that Obaluwaye is the power of control by the means of disease and death, this power when it walks at night is Omolu and when it is triggered for aggressive purposes is Sonponna. Omolu have to generals under him that oversee the work of these wonderful spirits. :: Exu Caveira (Sergulath) :: Exu Meia Noite (Had) :: Exu Tata Caveira (Proculo) :: Exu Mirim (Serguth) :: Exu Brasa (Haristum) :: Exu Pimenta (Trimasacl) :: Exu Pemba (Brulefer) :: Exu Male (Sustugriel) :: Exu Mare (Pentagnoy) :: Exu das 7 montanhas (Eleogap) :: Exu Garangola (Sidragosum) :: Exu Ganga (Damoston) :: Exu Arranca T6co (Minosum) :: EXll Kaminalo{t (Tharithimas) :: Exu Pagan (Bucons) :: Exu Quiromb6 (Nel Biroth) :: Exu do Chciro (Aglasis) :: Exu Curado (Meramel) 123"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Nothing created is ever lost in nature. Everything is subject to transformation. Omolu is the keeper of this secret. He is the graveyard dirt where all possible int1uences from soul and the sub-terrestrial are parted, brought together again and re established by the hand of transformation. He is depicted as a red robed skeleton holding a cutlass and a cross, surrounded by sepultures and coffins. Omolu is the man in the gate, the torch in the portal. The mirror of what is coming after life, he is the cross found planted in the center of the Calunga, to where all veneration is given. As mentioned, Omolu is more or less the same as Obaluwaye, but even if there are similarities to be found it is interesting to look somewhat closer at this regarding Omolu and who this spirit really is. The apparent confusion came into being through two avenues, one through the syncretism with the Saints and the other through Candomble. In Candomblc there is a tendency of equaling Omolu and Obaluwaye either to be the same deity or if there is difference it is one ofgeneration, Omolu being an older representative of Obaluwaye. This is quite correct as the name Omolu, means \"child ofGod\" and denotes a very immediate descent and relatedness to God. The cult is closely related to the mysteries ofdeath and its transformation while Obaluwaye is a deity of disease, especially smallpox, cholera and malaria and is the same force working during the daytime. Obaluwayes reputation as a healer is often preferred before his misanthropic qualities. And here enters another mistake, the ability of healing. Certainly they both can heal, but Omolu is more ready to do such things than Obaluwaye. The ability of healing is found in the mystery of St. Lazarus, who suffered death and resurrection. This saint has been ascribed to both Obaulwaye and Omolu, and thus represents the magnificent 124"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"powers and mysteries of Omolu/Obaluwaye with a focus on miracle working and healing. In reality it is Nana Buluku, the mother of Omolu that represents the power of healing, but this aspect has become quite clouded in the Diaspora in general and Nana Buluku did not made it to Kiumbanda. Certainly there is the whole issue of Yoruba influence that should be discussed more fully, but unfortunately such lengthy discussion of morphology will fall quite outside the informative and practical aims ofthis work. Another saint syncretized with Omolou is St. Blaise, an Armenian bishop from the 4th century that was chased away from his diocese and sought communion with wild beasts in the hills around Armenia. When he was finally found he had the gift of communion with beast as well as cure in apparently magical ways. He was asked to give up his worship but he refused, he was tortured by ripping pieces of his flesh asunder with sharp metal tools and finally decapitated. This is the legend of Omolu as understood as the Boneherd, the master of the cemetery. One can understand from this that Omolu is the gate to many mysteries concerning the transition from life to death, pain and its enlightenment as well as the cost of being solid and irrevocable. Amongst the many kings Omolu is demanding absolute respect and his mbordinates are participating in this same serious atmosphere. He is the king of the Mystery of death and he guides the hand that transforms. Iconography: A skeleton, robed in red holding a small coffin in his hands Pontos Cantados of Omolu O!

Exu Caveira knows the art of war and is a master in planning attacks that bring the enemy on their knees. He defeats all adversaries. It is this Exu, who presides over the vigil the kimbandeiro is doing in the Calunga and is accordingly a vehicle for an important power that needs to be transmitted to the Tata to gain the license to work with these spirits. He manifests in the sense of fear and watchfulness of the cemetery after midnight. He is always symbolized by skulls, candles and tridents. Whenever work is done in the cemetery, you need to pay him due respect. This is often done by lighting a black candle on the third grave on the left side of the cemetery. Knock tree times on the grave and put down the candle. Ask him then license to use his kingdom. He also supervises the ascent of spirits and souls at the cemetery and thus serves a crucial function in the kingdom of Exu. He is also known to be a very good spirit to approach in problem solving of any kind and is far more concerned with matters of elevation and health than his fearful form suggests.

He was, however, in love with a girl whose father was reluctant to give his daughter to a soldier and demanded that he should acquire wealth and prestige before given the hand of his daughter. He started to work his way up and after many years, he owned half the district and was a politician of renown. However, he had a brother, a sinister and sly creature who happened to be a good friend with the girl's father, and the night before Proclus was going to ask the girl's hand his brother bought the girl. Proclus ,vas greatly saddened, while the girl accepted her fate. Shortly afterwards, enemy nations attacked the little city at the Nile River, raped the women, and killed the children. They burned Proclus and many of his loyal comrades. Some say that the 49 men who were burned in this attack formed the basis of the 49 legions of Kiumbanda. However, the pain of fire ,vas nothing compared to the pain of betrayal by his brother and so he transcended to the ranks of an Exu.

The following Monday go to a crossroads and place the jar in the centre, asking the powers of the crossroads the license to work there. Recite the prayer seven times, lighting seven black candles around the jar. Take a stick and smash the vessel completely, scattering the remains all around. When the result has manifested, go back to the crossroads and give proper offerings to Exu Pagao.

In addition, he is also found at the \"real\" midnight, when vesper is rising. He is well versed in all kinds of magic and is said to be the tutor of the Antiochian priest St. Cyprian, who was reputed to convert to priestly work in order to carryon with his dark practices without being disturbed by the Church. The grimoire carrying his name is said to have been inspired by Midnight Exu. Another story tells that he was a baron coming from Portugal to Santos, who later moved to Minas Gerais where he fell in love with a girl fourteen years old. He married her, but during the wedding night she did bleed and he suspected her of not being a virgin. He expelled her from his house and killed her family. Later he received news that she had given birth to his son and he took her back. The child died and so they tried again. Another child was born, who also died. After this, the baron was haunted by a dark shadow slowly killing him and upon death, he became an Exu. This Exu is a gentleman, and he is serious in all his dealings. He is depicted with one goat foot and one human foot, denoting his position on the threshold between the worlds. He is said to have eyes of fire and to inspire fear in people when he comes down in his worshippers. His form fits very well the idea ofhow one envisions Satanaz. He can bestow the powers of hydromantia and astral magic. The Midnight Exu has 7 legions and their generals under his command, ending with Exu Curad6. This, in a way, reflects back on the general himself and is as well a distinct. solitary being, just like Exu of the Scent is in relation to Exu Caveira. The knowledge of divination, tarot, the mysteries of kabbalah and astrological magic is his domain. In many ways, one can say that Midnight Exu is the spirit who today moves people with an inclination toward magic in the medieval vein, and the fruits of his inspiration can be seen in the works of Eliphas Levi. The deepest part of his mystery is related to the death ofJesus Christ, the Son of God and the exact moment on the holy Friday when Jesus gave up his hreath and the veil in the temple was rent asunder. At this exact moment Midnight Exu assumed his power.

From this egg will be born a little devil, which should be kept inside a silver box, with silver powder. Every Saturday you should put in your baby finger from your right hand for the little devil to drink blood. Whoever is able to possess the demon in this way will get everything he wants in life.

The understandings of Pomba Gira varies from seeing her as a divine whore to a not so divine whore, but more the infernal lover of Satan to be seen as representing the dark side of needed spirituality, the left hand of Umbanda. She is also found in some houses of Catimb6 and in Candomblc, especially the houses of Angola, given her relationship to the Congolese mysteries. Certainly there is a Congo spirit by the name Bongbogira or more rightly Pambunjila -also Mavamhu and Aluvaia as this deity is found amongst many Bantu speaking people and accordingly colored by different dialects. One can also assume that the name Bombongira is a contraction and alteration of mpungo and nzila which means \"spirit of the road\". In present day Brazil, the name Pomba Gira means literally \"dove that flies around\" and has a somewhat sweet connotation that related this spirit to divine grace and the holy spirit and the whole series of mysteries mirrored in the functions of Salome, Martha and Mary of Magdala.

To state that she is a female Exu is right in terms of her quality, that she is a feminine force related to the element of lire and earth, just like Exu. One might say that at the most base level, Pomba Gira is an Exu with the addition of water and sweet scent.

Given that they are the Kings and n Queens of the lower soul they will naturally he fed upon emotions, anger and turbulence. One will notice that requests and appeals to the spirits are not accommodated or the results are highly temporal or they end in trouble. This unruly essence of these spirits probably led to the practice found in Umbanda to place the Exus as servants of Orixas, since they then would have a more elevated force to control them. As a consequence Umbanda cultivated these forceful spirits within a context that restrained these forces to a great extent and their beneficial influence is seeping out. Almost all people have an Exu and a Pomba Gira since we all have a world of passions gi ven our human condition. The trick is to allow our divine faculties to rule these forces, independent of external spirits drawn il1to the workings. To enter somewhat more deep into this, we should also note that the male/female distinction is far deeper than what meets the eye. At it, fundamental level, EXLI represent the capacity of force and aggression 161"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"and Pomba Gira represent the emotional and sexual domains. Even if additions to the legions ofExu arc commonly from the male representatives ofhumans and for Pomba Gira from females the capacity that wanders on and joins thcse lcgions are not confined to either sex, but colored by it. Accordingly we ascribe the undcrstanding of femaleness to matters ofthe heart and emotions whilc aggression is attributed to malcness. In practice, this means that a person that has no control over his or her lower souls will tend to bc dominatcd by the King and Queen of this realm and thus run the danger of succumb into violence and seediness. One might say that the term \"Kimbanda\" refers to the work with Exu and Pomba Girano matter if the cultivation is done within Candomblc, Umbanda or as in our case related to an attempt of working as purc as possible to the European and Congolese way. The term Kiumbanda that are chosen to designate the workings in this book refers to a deliberate working \\vith malevolent spirits and nfuri of a violent or ndoki disposition with a greater emphasis on cultivation of these spirits of a more personal nature leading to the workings not only of each terreiro or temple being particular and unique, but also for each practitioncr. The word Kiumbanda, can mean literally \"the working of the skull\" and with this any skull, any kind of base level fonnof enef!\"ry as encountered amongst practitioners offor instance \"non baptized Mayombe\" in ordcr to make a refercnce to deepen the understanding of what wc are speaking about. Another interesting syncretism done in regards Pomba Gira is related to Klephot or Qliphot, which ties her in with the mystery ofLilith and the sephirah Yesod. Klcphot is the fallen calabashes of light from the first attempt of creation that fell givcn their ovcrtlowing of divine light. These fallen vessels, given their divine origin, are not subject to destruction, but rather they are found as latent forces in the abysmal stratas related to all the sephirot on the Etz Chaim or Tree of Life. This relationship is meaningful both in terms of thc nature of thc l(nver soul and also the multiple areas of function for the Exus and Exuas and their enormous rangc of manifestation, from bcing coqucttish and vulgar to being serene and sage like. This is particular evident when one goes high up in the various hierarchies where one can note a distinct elevation of character the higher up in the hierarchy one enters. There is a certain purity of the direct expression of the power each and everyone is expressing and the spirit is very much coloured by thcir station in the natural kingdom. This is why it is always advisable to appeal to the general of a given hierarchy or to ones personal Exu or Pomba Gira in order to effectuate a concise work. 162"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"But with this, yet another word of \\varning is in its place, the working with these spirits requires that you know your self well, because these spirits will for sure test and try the one who strays into their kingdom to see if they are worthy. Any perversion, any clandestine secret that the darkofthe moon is hiding is bound to surface if one seek out Pomba Giras' help and friendship. For males especially their attitude and respect towards woman will be challenged and for woman the respect their harbor towards their own womanhood. If anything is lacking in terms of understanding this will for sure lead to sever trials from this harsh and fair lady. Another mistake seen from time to time in the occult world is the equation of Pomba Gira with Babalon, the thelemic prostitute. If you approach her as a prostitute this is the face she will give and accordingly she will challenge this idea and take you as far as needed in order to make you realize what she truly is. H.er powers to int1uence lovemaking, bindings and works of asexual, sensual and amorous nature is largely based in the primordial Pomba Giras' ofan European origin that often were free women, meaning women that did not saw that they needed to be dependent of any man -not that they were frivolous sluts. The ultimate lesson of Pomba Gira is the respect and understanding of womanhood. In some cases one have also noted that the worship of Pomba Gira by people not interested in understanding the lessons these spirits arc giving will only harbor undesired effects, one of them being obsession. Obsessive workings with Pomba Gira based on a vulgar conception of her identity as a prostitute and a slave we can ask to do our bidding as long as we seduce her with gifts and offerings. Obsessive workings with this force will for sure produce unpredictable results as well as change ones sexual current, there are examples of males engaging them selves in homosexual practice and women turning into prostitutes as a consequence ofobsessive worship from a perverse angel with these spirits. Returning to the idea of Pomha Gira being related to the nature of witches familiars we will get numerous clues of how to approach this magnificent force. Another mistake often seen with people working with these spirits is to place unreasonable demands on spirit and also require assistance in a field of need where the power in question has little int1uence. For instance, to ask Pomba Gira Rainha do Sete Encruzilhadas to solve ones emotional turmoil is perhaps not the best idea - unless this is ones personal Pomba Gira. One is hetter advised to turn to Pomba Gira da Praia to solve such issues. So, misplaced demands is one issue another is unreasonable demands. This means that one asks for solutions in areas of our life without giving proper attention to the circumstances of our need, the fuel needed by spirit to make the work or that we work with spirit based upon a weak or 163"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"misunderstood connection to ones personal Pomba Gira. In such cases it will be to ask a favor from someone we hardly know. One should be aware that Pomba Gira is not an easy spirit and the future practitioner need to invest much time and energy in establishing a good relationship with this spirit as well as working with ones own issues and lower aspirations.ln contradiction to the beliefs often seen, these spirits do not delight in evilas such. On the contrary works done by people conscious and sincere with a good heart and a generous soul are more often rewarded than the sinister people that might believe that these spirits are their servants but this is aU a sordid game towards the real lessons given that the practitioner do not remain blind and deaf as the spirit is calling. In essence there is a sense ofjustice at work within these spirits that are reflected in the result ofones workings. This justice is however amoral and can certainly do great damage even if the cause was not justified. One example can be a love binding. How fair is it for the person in question to be tied to another person? \\Vhat are our motivations for doing this? If the answer is pure desire the result can often be ambiguous in one way or the other. Often the result manifests, but in ways not expected and the consequences can be dire in order to provide you with a lesson that aims towards allowing a greater influence from the higher soul to mediate ones desires and needs. In order to work with Pomba Gira it is needed to offer to her material that are on her frequency. Objects from the mineral, vegetal and animal kingdom that resonates with her energetic presence and accordingly both manifest the spirit in the sacred space as well as gives the spirit needed fuel and energy to carry out the request. The items used in workings for Pomba Gira is pemba (chalk) in white, red and black, ribbons and candles in the same colors, champagne, cigarillos, or cigarettes, matches, fine china and crystal, jewelry, silk cloth, olive oil, palm oil, essential oils, lipstick, make up, combs, red roses (usually without thorns), eggs, graveyard dust, various precious stones and metals. The workings are preferably done in the places ofpower, Le. the natural sites such as crossroad, cemetery, beach or the woods. Alternatively one can make the workings in the terreiro of Pomba Gira and place the working in the proper place upon completion. Usually the effects desired will usc some time to manifest, at least three days at the most seven months. But usually the desire will be manifested within one lunar cycle. The lunar cycle should be observed upon working with Pomba Gira. The new moon is elected for workings related to binding, the new moon for prosperous workings, a waning moon for harmful workings and a waxing moon for workings of growth. Meaning, a spell for binding is better performed in the last three days of the moons waning towards new 164"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"moon, while a spell to secure emotional love is better performed under the light of the full moon. The hour most frequently elected is what is rcfer:ed to as the Great Hour, meaning midnight - as the kingdom ofExu and Pomba Gira enters into activity as the night is setting in and is at its peak when Venus enters the Sh)' and when the clock strikes 12. It is time to look more closely on the myths and nature of the most important Pomba Giras. Solely those Pomba Giras that arc most famous arc discussed here, meaning that most of these Pomba Giras arc either Quel'ns or have been subject to immense popularity and arc therefore considered to be exceptionally strong. There are of course many more, but from those that will be mentioned the others rose. The first Pomba Gira to be discussed is Maria Padilha that are some times referred to as the Queen of Candomblc and amongst kimbandeiros sometime:-. referred to as a Queen without a crown, which I believe is a reference to her status as a royal mistress, but not as a woman formally married to a king. Maria Padilha came to Portugal from Spain or Portugal and her name is mentioned in spells from the Iberian Peninsula dating back to the 15th Century. Usually she is found in the company of Salome, Barrabas, Satanas, Lucifer and Caifas. Let us now look closer on this most famous of all the Pomba Giras. C~ira P;ldilh,l ~ krH l\\\\'n as Ca;...tela (12UlTtI of t'a~tilkl, n Pomba Gira Maria Padilha is amongst the most famous of all Pomba Gira, and is more close to the proto-typical European witches, such as the witches of Evora and the Basque witches. Her fame is due to her efficiency in rituals and swift execution of desires. Her form is similar to women like Marquesa dos Santos, the mistress of Dom Pedro II. She is clearly representing the free woman, who makes her own choices that never fall under the charm of men but seek to retain her independency. The stories about her are many, ranging from her being an aristocratic woman that took her delight amongst men as she wanted to and never entered into marriage but stayed in the role as a mistress -on her own terms. As such Maria Padilha represents the independent woman and she demands respect nn these premises. Umbanda workings has demonstrated that this force tlows very elegantly and good if one incorporate Ogum in the workings 165"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"and ask him to intervene and make stable the working and its results. This is an important observation given that Ogum represents pure maleness and this energetic circuit is to her liking and there is a mutual respect and delight to be found between the two spirits. Likewise one can also apply Nkisi Zarabanda in workings with Pomba Gira Padilha. This should give some indication of the practitioners needed constitution or what type of force field is needed to bring into the sphere of working. :;\\Imv, let us return to the many myths. The most famous one tells about a strong, hardworking woman, beautiful and desired by men who was born into a low social status. Maria given her brilliant mind and seductive charm was able to work her self up to the status of the Kings lover and even gave him children. In spite of the Kings repeated requests of marry him, she refused and thus was said to be the Queen without a crown. She is related to the reign ofKing Pedro I ofCastilha in the second part of the 12th Century (but the story is told with reference to many other segments in terms of timcline) with the Moorish invasion of Spain. In those days the court was found in Seville and it was a good time for the castle as the king was loved and popular. He was charismatic, a brave warrior and a good hunter. Pedro and his men became subject for the songs of troubadours and local plays. Maria Padilha worked in the court of Seville and by the help from a Hebrew magician that made for her a magical mirror of marble that contained the powers of Eros. Don Pedro was married to D011a Blanca, a woman that was said to be rather mid of charm and elegancy - also she resided in France which gave ample room for the king to indulge with consorts and concubines. When the eyes of Don Pedro fell on the beautiful and strong Maria Padilha it did not took long before she became the de facto Queen ofCastilha. Don Pedro did no attempt on hiding this romance and Maria Padilha was loved and respected for her charm and elegancy and feared for her aptness in the wise arts. The common stories infuse at this point Maria Padilha being subject for the interest of the Inquisition which led to Dom Pedro bringing Maria to Angola where she learned both the magic ofthe Bantu speaking people as well as magic and mysteries from the Muslim people residing in Angola. This however seem to be a mix up with a concubine of Dom Pedro of Portugal some three Centuries later that were referred to as Pedro the Cruel, that led to the exile ofMaria Padilha to Brazil. Maybe she first was exiled to Africa and then to Brazil. The records arc not that clear and tlwre is also the presence of Maria Padilha as a separate deity in the company ofJesus accusers headed by the high priest Caif.is as well as within a more satanic context. This exiled woman that entered the coast ofBahia around 166"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"1535 ended into legends as a powerful sorceress with the knowledge of the Nganga and a Queen of the powers of the night. Arabian dances, love s;>clls, potions, work of seduction and fascination was everything related to her powers and mystery. It is from this happy woman, well versed in dance, divination and sorcery with a preference for fine jewels, clothes and drinks that became the proto-typical Pomba Gira and her connotation with the night and powers dark found its reflex in Pomba Gira being the wife of Exu, that was syncretized with the diabolic powers. This is of course solely a way of interpretation of Exu in a diabolic scope. Noting the fact that African systems of belief do not have a devil in the sense of Christianity the diabolic level of Exu was clearly influenced from Europe and the heavy interest for demonology in the 14th to 17th Century. This is further displayed in the hierarchy of Kiumbanda, where the maioral (supreme chief) is Lucifer and not the Orisa Eilll. :Nlaria Padilha has her manifestations in every natural kingdom and in all reigns of Kiumbanda and we can therefore find Maria Padilha with the epitaph of amongst many others: Maria Padilha Rainha - dos 7 Cruzeiros da Calunga Maria Padilha Rainha - das 7 Encruzilhadas (Dona Sete) Maria Padilha Rainha - dos Infernos Maria Padilha Rainha - das Almas Maria Padilha Rainha - das Portas do Caban? Maria Padilha Rainha - das 7 Navalhas ~1aria Padilha Rainha -da Figueira Maria Padilha Rainha - das 7 Catacumbas Maria Padilha Rainha - dos 7 Cruzeiros da Calunga All Pomba Giras that comes down under this name, regardless of path of manifestation share a similar fundamental energy and preferences. The variations arc related to specific areas ofexpertise. Like a Pomba Gira of the catacombs will naturally be efficient in the teaching of necromancy and Calunga will be more apt to help out in matters of health and trafficking with the dead. This is important matters to keep in mind, a perfect ritual aiming to\\vards appeasing and gain the favors of an energetic expression that are less able to accommodate ones requests will work out in unexpected ways. One should also be aware that the spirits ofKiumbanda is sympatric towards other spirit kingdoms and one can work with Pomba Gira under the supervision of a different deity, like Omolu who has his domain in the cemetery -but is a older and less turbulent force that the Exus and Pomba Giras in order to fortify the axe one desire to manifest. 167"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"This means that the kingdom of Kiumbanda consists of spirits highl! dynamic and friendly towards change and pleasantly disposed towards alliances. One should however never forget that they also, when entered into a personal relationship, will also in many cases temper the worshippers character by introducing needed lessons and dilemmas that the worshipper need to solve in order to grow in understanding not only about the spirits but also about him or her selt: This comes into being given their deep relation to the sub lunar realm and interest in human affairs. In conclusion this means that these spirits are not evil beings that delight in evil doing, they are simply amoral in their action, but they read the human psyche extremely well and will always work towards a betterment of the human condition amongst their adherents. The spirits of Kiumbanda are separated into many kingdoms, and in most cases there is also a proto-typical Pomba Gira found in every kingdom, as such the many l\\1arias can be said to form a kingdom by them self -but also they cross over to other kingdoms. For instance Maria ~lulambo, Maria Quiteria or Maria Lixeira are all rdated to strong women that has suffered poverty but in the end gain supremacy over them sclfand status in the spirit world. Maria Mirongueira is a Pomba Gira that works quite uncritical with spell workings while Maria das Almas is related to the dynamic transgression between life and death. Other Maria's such as Maria da Praia, Maria Cigana, Maria T (mica, Maria Rosa, Maria Colodina. Maria Farrapos, ~laria Alagoana, ~laria Bahiana, Maria 'Kavalha and many others depending on where in Brazil one is as well as being marked by social circumstances and needs, but have in common the image of the strong woman that suffers her way to position. Also worthy mentioning is the trans-global essence ofPombaGira, she is taken from all levels ofsociety and from all colours and cultures. The basic point is the energetic current of Pomba Gira being found in the one about to transmigrate. The various Pomba Giras, from base and low levcb to more the status of a Queen is said to be replicated in her worshippers. Meaning that, if one person has a personal Pomba Gira that arc Maria Lixcir for instance this energy should be transformed in the worshippers life so that this basic and original energy in the end will be \"crowned\" upon the worshiper in a way that opens up for a royal energy when the worshipper has gone full circle, from his or hers personal Pomba Giraand become merged with the royal powers of the Queen so one can maintain control over ones lower soul and appeal to forces that can motivate ina constructive manner. 168 "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"It is said that Pomba Gira is passionate in helping white women andoften one can see that European women with no connection to Brazil a~tually manage to draw these forces quitc elcgantly into their life. This is perhaps less related to color than to culture. One can say that European women represent the \"ancestrality\" of Pomba Gira Maria Padilha, a remembrance of a time in mundane delight so she both easily access the one who makes the petition and with great understanding will understand how to aid, help and guide.

On the seventh day you will take what is left of the candles and throw under a plant. This Pomba Gira has been related to Pititis in a modern day attempt ofsyncretism. This syncretism is perhaps more proper than many others as this spirit is a matron of witches in Mexican folklore that ties her in with another famous and magical worship in Mexico and some areas of Latin America, Our lady of Guadeloupe. The queen of the seven crosses is found in the cemetery and is a rather cold and distant spirit that can manifest in extremely hot and agitated ways. She works healing very well, hut she is a master of the black rites and is well disposed to inflict turbulence in people's life without ones enemy noticing that there is a herd of malice hovering over his or her shoulder. She takes good care of her votaries and is an excellent teacher that gives freely from her vaults of wisdom. This Pomba Gira works well under the supervision of Ogum or Omolu. One can also use Zarabanda and Coballende in the workings with her. She need to be contacted in the cemetery and one need to give marafo and three coins to the entrance of the cemetery either to Ogum megc or to Coballende in order to be granted access to walk through the kingdom of death an approach the Queen of the seven Crosses. \\Ve use the intervention of Maria Padilha or Sete Encruzilhada for working with her as she is closely related to these Pomba Giras.

Calunga This name means literally 'Queen ofthe little water\" or \"Queen of the little cemetery\". In Kiumbanda the word \"calunga\" is usually translated into cemetery, while in Palo Mayombe it is referring to the ocean. Both interpretations are fulfilled in the characteristics of this Pomba Gira. This Pomba Gira has been associated with Lilith. This is however far from the truth. This Pomba Gira has as her sacred number twelve -12, while Lilith is related to nine - 9. The confusion is perhaps entering given a similar erotic nerve between Lilith and this Pomba Gira who has her kingdom at the bottom of the ocean, where the spirits of those that died at sea are under her domain. She is said to appear in the form of a mermaid or a talking sea creature and is accordingly related more to the native Indian myths of amphibian shape shifters and the Sirens of Greek legends that draw the sailors into their misery by their seductive song. One can even go so far as reminding about the movie \"Dagon\" by Fernandez and Yuzna (2000) that in the depiction of the princess of Dunwich gives an interesting anJ fairly accurate Jescription of this Pomba Gira. She can be worked together with Yemoja or Olokun in order to fortify and give a good direction on her working. She is said to be the queen of a whole tribe of Exus and Pomba Giras that live in kingdoms at the bottom of the ocean and manifest in dangerous, poisonous and unusual sea creatures, such as monkfish, electric eel, puffer fish and sharks. She rules deep emotions and passions and can work n ways that makes a lost lover returning a wayfaring husband to come home -with passion and eyes only for you. She can also he used in order to awaken the erotic and sensual urges in aman who has lost interest for you as well as ignite a new passion in the female and reawaken the desires. A working with this Pomba Gira should be done at the shore of the Ocean, preferably at a cliff where the immediate water is deep and not at the beach line.

Pomba Rainha cIa, This Pomba Gira is syncretised with Proserpina and the myths and stories about her is replicating the abduction ofProsperpina by Hades. This would indicate that this Pomba Gira is quite old and is by herdual observance a mighty source of for wisdom. She knows both the healing spirits of wood and water as well as knowing well the kingdom of Omolu. This places this Pomba Gira in a position unique when workings ofhealing deadly diseases are sought or understood. The Queen of the fields is deeply related to the fair folk of the land and is as such both kind and dangerous and should be approached by showing respect for her domain. Her colours arc green and dark blue with spots of red. She works tightly with Jurema and lara and can also be approached through other caboclos and enchanted ones.

Pomhu Maria Mulamho is a beloved Pomba Gira and a patron of the p(x)r and of widows. She is associated with the succubus Aluca which is yet again a hit in the wrong direction. Actually the legend telling about Mulamho, a word which means\" rag\", is more alike the story of a saint. The story goes like this: Once upon a time there was a woman named Maria Rosa who was of low aristocratic hirth, beautiful of features and kind of heart. The son of the king fell in love with the heautiful and kind Maria Rosa and when she turned fifteen a marriage was arranged. The prince was devotedly in love with her, hut the love was only from one side. Maria Rosa was in fact in love with a poor man that she met in one ofthe p(x)r quarters ofthe tOV.TI where she liked to stay and help the people with their needs. The years passed and any attempt of begetting a child failed. The prince saw her as a \"cherry trce that could not hear any fruit\". This hothered the royal family more than Maria. Maria invested more and more time helping the poor and needy. As the difficulties escalated at the castle given that she was unable to he pregnant she starred to nurture the relationship with her true love. Meanwhile the king died and the prince was crmvned and Maria was made Queen. She was very much loved by the people but also envied and some people in the higher aristocratic lcvels questioned more and more severely her inability ofbegetting children. 111e [loor people she had helped over the years had nothing to give to their beloved Queen so they made from t10wers a carpet so the Queen could pass on a bed of Howers after the coronation. When the king saw how his wife flamed up in love by this gesture he felt envy tlocx.ling him and when the ceremonies finished and 191"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"they went to their room he beated her badly. The abuse became a common element in Maria Rosa's life. But the bruises and pains did not stop her charity and finally the love between Maria Rosa and the poor man was consumed and she became pregnant. Maria abdicated her position in order to stay with her beloved. She took with her costly jewels and dresses, but she dressed her self in rags, like the people she loved and helped. She was finally happy in her humble condition. The news about Maria's pregnancy reached however the king and he went insane with this knowledge a~ this demonstrated that the 'barren tree\" was him and not Maria Rosa. He set out to find Maria and upon finding her he tied stones her body and threw her into the river. Maria sank and her tears mixed with the river streams. This was done in all secrecy, the people did not know about the murder of the king. Seven days after the murder strange and beautiful flowers started to blossom at the riverside where the murder had taken place and the fishes went to this place and left the rest of the river empty. It was on this seventh day of ~1aria's murder that her lover was drawn to this place, guided by voices from beyond and he jumped into the river and fuund there at the bottom the body of his beloved. Her body was perfectly intact and she seemed more like sleeping than being dead. He brought her back to the village and adorned her body with fine cloth and jewels. When this news reached the king he went crazy and remained in a delirium until his death and her lover remained passionately in love with Maria the rest of his life and remained without lover, wife or consort because his Maria came to him at night comforting him and speaking with him. Naturally this Pomba Gira is very generous and it is difficult to cross her. Only a profound lack of understanding for ones O\\vn situation and reluctance to change can cross her - as well as unfair treatment of women and widows. Maria Mulambo is a spirit that questions what we need in order to be happy and if we are following our heart. If we do not listen to our heart we will not be able to connect with this spirit. She is a spirit that when approached comfort the ones that is suffering from abuse or a love-less relationship and she can be employed to solve these situations. She works usually on a more slow range than other Pomba Giras and one should calculate one lunar cycle for the work to come through. As this spirit is related to charity and kindness, her votaries need to express the same qualities in order to draw her interest for help and aid to come about. She is a very good remedy against depression and hopelessnes~. Like with the other Pomba Giras she likes jewels, flowers, fine wine and so on, but her demands arc simple and she prefers gifts from the heart 192 "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"more than expensive presents.

The father resented the last daughter because of the mothers' death and she was raised by her grandparents. The mother's grave was prepared in the house the family was living and Rosa Caveria grew up guided by her mothers' spirit who thought her how to use her powers. The family had a tradition of helping people in need with their powers and so Rosa Caveira followed suit and became an object of envy for her other sisters. An alternative story tells that the mother were helping in childbirth and the client died and the child survived and thus received the name Rosa Caveira and the infusion of witch power came from the midwife. Anyhow, Rosa Caveira was blessed with immense powers a great sensitivity and tremendous mediumistic abilities. The father also took a special interest in Rosa Caveria and thought her the art of the warrior and the use of swords and knifes while the spirit of the mother instructed her in the work of potions and magic. The jealousy of the sisters grew and grew and they accused Rosa Caveria of being a daughter of the devil - that her knowledge was from the demons. Rosa Caveria's bodily and facial beauty did not helped the situation. When Rosa Caveira was 19 her oldest sister got married to a rich man and she attempted to take her life.

These are referred to as pagan, baptized and crowned manifestations of Ext!. This relates to the fact that Kimbanda or Kiumbanda is basically a cult of death; most Exus once walked the earth and became members of the many legions of Exu upon ascending to the afterlife. There are many theories about the reason for this form of ascent. The theories range from the idea that there were men and women who were recklessly evil and were transformed into Exu and Pomba Gira so they could continue their mischief, to theories saying that they were transformed into Ext! and Pomba Gira to repent for their many sins and evil done while on earth. Thus, they are given a chance to evolve into enlightened beings. Yet again, some see them as avatars of light in its many fractions that are perfect as they are, spiritual forces essential in maintaining cosmic balance -and as such, they need only to achieve perfection in the form they have. I tend to adhere tc. the last theory. When speaking of Exu as being pagan, baptized of crowned, any of the three theories are plausible. Pagan Exus refer to spirits that have no sense of moral or ethic, that arc prone to do whatever service, given that the client feeds the spirit. A baptized Exu will have a notion of good and bad, and is not so easy to employ when the implication is that one is working the Exu on unfair conditions or for unjustified reasons. For instance, you have a conflict with another person: the case is more a question of misunderstanding or difference ofopinion but you start to harbour hatred against the person and decide to engage in magical attack. If you use a baptized or crowned Exu in such work, you are likely to experience that the work backfires, or if it works at all, will have a very different outcome than expected. Crowned Exus are just spirits of light and it is these spirits that teach the Tata and Yaya, it is these spirits that oversee the progress, evolution and organization of the many legions, the work done and the progress of the priests and priestesses. The crowned Exus are spirits that have reached their fullness of becoming in the spirit world and they are marvellous guides and assistants in the work of combating the satanic impulses stemming from our lower souL In addition, we also have the spirits referred to as kiumbas. These spirits are malefic and obscure spirits 215"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"related to the time of the night commonly referred to as the blue hour. Work with these spirits is best done under the protection ofa crowned Exu. In spite of their dangerous temperament, they can contribute markedly to the protection of the terreiro and the Tata as well as greatly enhance the speed of workings. Now, any Exu can evolve in the relationship with its Tata, this means that if ones Exu is a pagan Exu, the kimbandeiro can, by focused and structured working help the spirit, in time, reach the crowned state. In a way, any relationship with any Exu begins on un-baptized ground - which is why the kimbandeiro has to step carefully within this kingdom. The organization into kingdoms shows in where in nature a particular spirit is most potent. It is also a good aid in selecting herbs for the work and despacho. It does also provide a safety net for the Tata and Yaya in cases where workings fail and negativity infests the house and the land: appeals can be made to the chief of the kingdom in question and purifications utilized and balance reintroduced using the primordial power of the kingdom. It is also useful to have a basic understanding of these types of organization of the spirits in order to know what kind of powers that needs to be greeted in order to gain license to work in the various kingdoms. The Seven Lines of Exu It is also common to organize the legions of Exu into specific line or legions, seven in number. The organization of the Exus then becomes quite different as we here are speaking about a different function than what is exposed in the hierarchy presented in this book. It is important to understand t11at the organization of Exu into lines results in a change of position, this means, if one wanted to organize the Exus into a kingdom or line of curandeiros, Exu Curad6 and Exu Pimenta would be high up in this hierarchy given their expertise in the art of healing and medicine. One factor needs to be stressed however; whatever Exu is the head of a given temple is the King of that place. Your personal Exu is the King in your life and as such is in charge, being on the top of the hierarchy for you. The hierarchies change according to what Exu is the most prominent in the various temples and terreiros. These spirits are organized in many different ways: just like spiritual and social organizations can vary in form, so do they. Further, one should be aware that the hierarchy as such is not carved in stone. It is a dynamic organization, and just as military officers change rank with time, indeed so do Exu. This is accomplished by the constant addition of new Exus to the legions, which induces a healthy 216 "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"dynamic into the organization of the various legions. Thus, the system turns into a dynamic relationship with the Exu and Pomba Gira, which is moulded upon personal congress with these spirits. The simple secret is that every Exu and Pomba Gira is a king or queen in his or her own realm, and the organization into hierarchies is actually far less important than the personal relationship the votary manages to form with Exu. Knowledge of the hierarchy may come handy when work with a given Exu is failing. One can approach an Exu higher up in the hierarchy of the Exu in question, in order to make the work happen or to re-install harmony. For instaoce, if a problem is experienced with Exu Carangola, one can try to appeal to either Exu Caveira or Exu Tranca Ruas as they are higher up in the hierarchy. Another element is that each Exu and Pomba Gira is by Umbandistas seen as having roads themselves. This means that there is an Exu Caveira of the Souls, just as there is an Exu Caveira of the Crossroad and so on. This manifold segmentation is neither helpful nor useful and can overtly complicate matters. Accordingly, it will not be subject for further discussion in this treatise. Another organization of Exu is in terms of kingdoms and lines, which are additional organizations to the strict hierarchy presented earlier. The kingdoms are as follows: Encruzilhadas (crossroads), Cruzeiro (a reference to the big votary Cross found in the cemetery), Mata (fields/ weeds), Calunga (Cemetery), Almas (Souls), Liras (Lyre) and Praia (Beach). These references are usually useful when one is asking license to work in a given kingdom and for selecting herbs as will be demonstrated in the next chapter. Exus from the basic hierarchy enter these kingdoms when work is about to be done, just like various officers when planning an attack enter into the positions demanded by the mission. This organization can be utilized when selecting herbs for use in specific workings. These positions will not necessarily be the same as their rank in the hierarchy. 151 Line -The Line of Malei is headed by Exu Rei This line is said to be related to the practices of Catimb6 and has lately gained a reputation of being a school of black magic, a sort of \"dark side\" of kimbanda, or the worst of the worst, if you will.

As such, they arc related to malefic spirits or \"demonic\" entities of crude composition that can be used in works of attack and malcfica. These spirits can also become guides and teachers for the kimbandciro, but they have a reputation of being unreliable, as they feed upon destruction, obsession and havoc. It is not possible to list the names of spirits of this line as they seck out the kimbandciro along personal paths and the working between the Tata and the kiumba needs to be restricted to the Tata and his Exu and Pomba Gira. 220 "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Finally, for your information, the lines of Exu as they arc related to Orixa and other spiritual forces in Umbanda arc presented.

Each working can be said to represent a contract hetween you and the spirit and all agreements of that contract must he honoured. The basic steps of ritual procedure are quite simple. They consist of purification of the practitioner (a bath with proper herbs); forming a clear intention ahout the working one intends to do; preparing the ritual space; presenting the objects and offerings to be used in the working and then performing the working itself. The \\vorking commences with the marking of the pontos riscados, placing the items, lighting the candles, baptizing or anointing the items: then the spirit is called by pontos cantados and prayers, and finally the ritual is closed. When working with Exu it is also important to decide upon the location of the working. If one has a consecrated temple for the spirits, all workings can he done there -and also the crossroads is a place that can be used for almost any kind of working, as it represent a juncture in time and space, where spirit meets with the worshipper. However, workings related to matters of the heart and emotions arc best done close to water, works of healing close to the woods or mountains, and works of elevation and mediumistic interaction in the cemetery. As is often done, one can prepare a padc for the working. It is a simple dish made of manioc flour and mixed with water, cacha~a, dendc or sweet liquor depending on one's purpose. For instance, if you want to prepare a padc for Pomha Gira, aiming toward domination and seduction, you will in this pade mix all these ingredients except water, since the dendc will agitate the spirit, the cacha~a boost the spirit and the sweet liquors open up for the more seductive avenues ofthe spirit. When doing a ritual every item comes in the numbers of 1,2,3, 7 or 9.3 and 7 arc the most frequently used numbers in Kiumbanda. Kahhalistically speaking, this indicates we are speaking ahout a manifestation of Saturn and Venus on earth, Venus being 7 and Saturn 3, and the numhers adds to 10 -earth or kingdom. When manifest, these spirits arc solely related to the elements of fire and earth, a composition that exposes the soul and hody for intense strain: one can experience draught, fatigue and other types of drainage of ener{,'Y while working with 225"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"these spirits. This is quite natural and there is no reason to be alarmed: one needs to take a bath, relax and take some time to recover from the congress with these spirits. One should also be mindful that alcohol, certain herbs and tobacco is food for these spirits and will naturally draw a stronger manifestation of them, inviting possession. When one is working with these spirits on wrong premises, motivated by the impulses from the realm of nafs and the lower soul, one nms the risk of becoming their slave or if you want, the misguided person will become a feast for these spirits. It is a short step from finding a friend in the spirits to them turning you into a plaything for their amusement. Understanding, attitude, loyalty and honour make the difference. Obsession and mild forms of mental disturbance are signs of an unhealthy relationship with these spirits and such relationship is very difficult to break. The spirits will test you, to see that your stamina is good, your endurance well proportioned and your sense of identity high. \\Vhenever you make a contract with these spirits, you need to be aware of the cost and consequences of what you are about to do, especially when engaging in malefica to change situations. It is because of the many pitfalls in working with these powerful and magnificent powers that initiation is necessary. Initiation means that one receives the license and knowledge to work with these spirits from an experienced Tata Kimbanda. Initiation also includes a presentation to these spirits and the possession of Exu or Pomba Gira is an affirmation that the spirits accepted the person coming for initiation. The possession can be everything from a strong gush of spiritual presence taking hold of the body to a full-fledged possession, where the spirit comes dovm and resides within the flesh of the person. Initiation can be done in a multitude of ways, according to complicated or simple schemas of spirit-congress. This means that the ways one can be granted license to work with Exu can take many forms depending on the lineage and orientation of the house of kimbanda. It is important to point out that license and knowledge is crucial for the effectuation ofgood work with these spirits. One can also seek communion with these spirits in front of their \"assentamento\", which is a physical vessel constructed upon the energetic current of Exu and activated by the Tata in such way that it becomes a physical dwelling place for spirit. The same can be done with the images or statues of Exu and Pomba Gira, which will be blessed, baptized and loaded with a charge that will attract the spirit in question to its representation when one calls the spirit before the statue. The best days for working with these spiriv. are Monday and Friday -but also Saturday can is suitable for Exu. Food, such as pade, beans, rice and meat are food for the spirits and can be placed as offerings in front of a charged statue or assentamento 226 "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"to give strength to the powers. The same is the case with alcohol, tobacco and the pontos. They all serve as food for the spirits and thus enhance the po~sibility ofeffectively accomplishing the working in question. Again, proper guidance is important and a non-committed experimental approach must be warned against. Likewise, a warning must be issued against uncritical and ridiculous syncretism rooted in lack of knowledge. It is not enough ~imply to be fascinated with these cults, while lacking real knowledge of the language, culture, history and the land, which gave birth to the spirits of kimbanda and kiumbanda. This is especially the case with the introduction of Thclemic correspondences within the legions of kiumbanda; Pomba Gira all of a sudden turns into Babalon and Exu into some version or avatar of the Great Beast. Such correspondences arc downright stupid and demonstrate severe lack of understanding ofthese spirits and ofThclemic concepts as well. Exu and Pomba Gira were born on Brazilian soil amongst practitioners of the Art from Europe and Africa; to mix Thelemic gnosis, which in nature and orientation has nothing whatsoever in common with the legions ofExu, is downright absurd. Certainly, a part of the explanation can be related to the misguided conception of the Scarlet Woman, or the deity dressed in red, who takes on the form of the prostitute. Failing to sec that this form presents a challenge and embracing her as a prostitute in the vulgar sense, not as the impulse of desire and creativity in the sacred marriage, will lead the feeble-minded people to fall in the abyss of illusion and confusion. Another clement of confusion is the introduction of demonic correspondences with Exu after Grimorium Verum, which in the '80s led to some satanically oriented houses of kimhanda taking root. This is equally stupid, as it reveals a lack of understanding of the use of the grimoires and also a fascination and indulgence in the affairs of the lower soul, on premises similar to those of a proud slave. The use of the grimoirs in kiumbanda is twofold. Firstly, it honours the spiritual heritage of Maria Padilha and secondly, the types of workings lIsing the kabbalistic pontos will actually manifest a more benevolent manifestation of Exu, more soft and good for enhancing one's understanding of these spirits. It is important to approach these spirits on their mvn premises and avoid such nonsense that I have witnessed to be a tendency amongst the curious seekers from the west. I am aware that these issues need a far more deep discussion, especially the demonic correspondences and their use, as well as the principles of god making and manifestation but this will be all too lengthy and will rather obscure the direction of this work. This will hmveyer be the theme for a future publication. 227"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Two Rites for Congress Two rites are deemed proper to present in this book, as they both follow a reasonably safe format for entering into congress with spirits. The first one, for Pomba Gira. follows a kabbalistic outline and the other ritual, which will open for Exu, is in a more heads-on format for congress. Offerings in both cases are alcohol and tobacco. The rituals are worked out as ways for opening to an understanding of these spirits and their nature. It is advisable to spend good time in meditation in the ritual space when attempting these rites. The Red Rite of Pomba Gira Rainha. You will trace a circle on the altar or/and on the floor in the centre of the temple. If the circle is traced on the floor position yourself inside. For this purpose, you can use pemba (chalk) or dun, sand (preferably mixed with cinnabar or red pigment) or com flour. If traced on virgin paper blessed ink will serve fine to trace the circle.

When selecting herbs the knowledge of the various kingdoms is important. If one desires to make a working related to the powers of the cemetery, one will select herbs from this kingdom; if one desires to work with the wild forces of the forest, one selects herbs from this kingdom. I will here present a collection of herbs most used from each kingdom, but there arc of course many others that could be added. The kingdom of the beach and ocean has not been included, as the herbs for usc here arc plants from the ocean or plants that grow in the sand dunes. This listing differs from that given in the previous chapter and we find here an organization of spirits based upon localization in natural sites. In general, the grammars themselves tell about the location of the various spirits, so it will be easy to usc this listing as a reference when applying the various plants. The Kingdom of the Crossroads Abre Caminho (Baccharis sp.): This plant is a type offern growing almost everywhere in South America and can be used in a variety of procedures.

This plant with cotton-like, juicy leaves is equally good for making despacho and a powerful repellent, especially for a troubled mind. The Kingdom of the Cruzeiro In the kingdom of the Cruzeiro we find the following herbs that can be used effectively: Losna (Artemisia cf. absinthium): Wormwood.

Arruda (Ruta graveolens): This plant is also known as Rue and is perhaps the most protective of all plants in the kingdoms of Exu. In cases of vampirism, this plant is a necessity and it can he carried as a talisman behind the left ear, as some benzedeiras do. There is a male and a female Arruda. The slightly smaller leaves distinguish the female Arruda. It is common to usc the female Arruda for females and the male for males. The plant absorbs negativity in itself and has to be thrown away after its use. Vence tudo (Rolandra fructiosa): This plant is almost as effective as Arruda and is a common ingredient in baths. It is very effective for discharging negativity and is especially good when one seeks to break the effects of spells and bindings.

It clams down obsessive spirit and can also ignite ritual combat. Food served to Exu on leaves of this plant is especially well received. Its oil can be used in any kind of ritual for almost any kind of purpose.

Attempt has been made to present a kind of original Kimbanda/QimbandalKiumbanda, predating the massive mixing and variation the cult has been subject to since the '70s. Since then, a growing interest in these spirits has taken Kiumbanda to a variety of directions, with Exu being coloured by Kardescism, Umbanda, Candomble, Satanism and esoterically orientated people of various persuasions. I have not tried to present \"The Truth\" about Exu, but instead convey a natural synthesis and conclusion, based on the research done. The focus has been on presenting the cult of Exu with attention to its pure origins as much as is possible. With 'pure', I mean an understanding of Exu, which regards the African and European heritage equally important for this Brazilian cult. The foremost exponent ofthis view I came across is Aluzio Fontenelle, who in spite of treating the subject of Exu from the viewpoint of Christianized Umbanda, presented in his book Exu a fairly pure idea about these spirits and their attributes. It is my hope that in making this material available to the public, I have managed to present a guiding light to this rich tradition, which often confuses the seekers with its many variations, lines and kingdoms. It is equally my hope that I have managed to place the cult of Exu in a context both historically and metaphysically rewarding and enlightening. Two more books on this subject will be released in the future. The Book of Seven Splendors is prospected to be released in a limited edition. This book will give a personal rendering of the work with Kiumbanda, based on the revelations handed down from Exu Dragao. This work is in preparation and will be made available when its guiding spirits deem the time is right. The third publication will be Codex Quimbandciro Curado, a manual of herbal wisdom. I hope I have, with this work, contributed in a good way to the corpus of knowledge about this amazing spiritual and magical tradition of this blessed land I call Terra de Vera Cruz. For blessed is this land, truly, as a Gan Eden for the pilgrim on the path of wisdom. 248"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"time At the Left Hand of God When you walk into the church ofSao Bento in SrlO Paulo it is like entering into a graveyard. The disciples of the carpenter from Nazareth, Yeshoua ben Yusef, is looking down from the walls. Here you can see St. Thomas looking down upon you with a gaze as from amongst dirt-ridden graves and old mausoleums, together with St. Philip and St. Andreas. All of them caught in the vortex of living blood hovering over you, stirring a somewhat uneasy current within. At the centre, we find Sao Bento himself together with an abbedissa. You look at them and you understand that Sao Bento was more close to the ways of Abbe Boullan' than the practices of the Roman Catholicism. In his hand, you find a scepter in the shape of a cross and from the bottom of the cross two snakes rise, one looking to the left and the other to the right -and one starts to wondering about this holy man -which hand of God he walked with. For a witch the answer is obvious, the spirit of his church and the strange and occult symbolism that is carved in with great precision from the door and up to the ceiling of the ship of the church, like the zodiacal signs in the ceiling of the entrance. Looking at the crossed serpent in his hand one might be tempted to question whether these snakes arc black and white, to be a symbol of a state of equilibrium between good and evil. But my mind forms the snake into the red snake and the black snake. Thwugh this, the serpent stretches from the holy Bento and takes the concept beyond good and evil to the realm of Exu and Pomba Gira, where we find Kimhanda, the cult of Exu. There is an immense amount of literature to be found on this subject, most of it coloured by Umbanda, Kimbanda, cabala or folk magic. Many are the ways of EXll and strange are his paths indeed; the many paths intertwining leading to the one. Before disclosing anything about this realm, a clarification should be offered to the reader in regard to the suhject of EXlI and the many Eshus one can find in the African Diasporic traditions of faith and helief. The cult of EXll is different from 249"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"the cult of Eshu found in Ifa. There is much diversity to be found as one encounters this deity in Candomblc, Santeria or Ifa. The Eshu/Eleggua of Palo Mayombe is again different from the Eshu of Ifa or Santeria and is called Lucero, so please keep all of these divine messengers outside ofthe cult of Exu as found within Kimbanda. with the exception of Candomble, which has absorbed the cult of Exu within its practices. Even if the line between Eleggua and Eshu is a narrow one, they are in temperament and essence different in spite of their similarities in function. In the cult of Exu there is great emphasis on \"incorpora.,;ao\", to incorporate, bring into the flesh, the spirit and entering into possession. In a consultation with a kimbandciro or a Pai de Santo of Candomblc, you will experience speaking directly with an Exu. Usually he speaks rude and vulgar language and will tell you an incredible number of times that that you are a son of a bitch and present you an ocean of sexual vulgarisms amongst the words of wisdom and advice that he gives. The concept ofincorporation is a delicate subject and one can sometimes wonder if the medium is totally possessed, or ifthere actually is a remnant ofthe human personae left in the possessed flesh. I have seen doubtful possession and impressive possessions in both Santeria and Kimbanda, ranging from the most violent and wild rides of the Orixa when it enters the body of a person; attempts of entering that are so forceful that you feel the heat in an instant rise to a high level and winds can be sensed around the person about to be possessed. In some instances no feeling of the entrance of the spirit can be sensed, suddenly the person has just changed his expression. What constitutes a genuine possession is the total surrender of ones body-mind for the use of a spirit. Incidents happen where the manifestation results in people burning their tlesh without it leaving marks, drinking strong alcohols with their ears, eating hot peppers and other things to prove that the spirit has taken over the body. This is possession in its most genuine and precise form. There are also instances where semi-possessions or less than full incorporation of the spirit has been achieved. These conditions have a lot in common with being absorbed into the oracular function of a deity one has entered into some sort of communion with, through techniques of ecstasy and trance. The mechanism at work in this is a subject we should leave in this essay, putting it to rest with these few words about this issue and just point out that genuine possessions and good mediums are probably not as frequent as it can seem. There arc many semi-possessions going on, which people claim are total possession which I personally have no problem with; one just should be able to discern between real advice and interference ofthe human mind when speaking with a spirit that is not fully riding the vessel. The cult ofExu is an integrated part ofCandomblc and Umbanda'. 250 "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Both are based upon Orixa~worship and have their root or resonance somehow in !fa, but while Candomblc has maintained its traditional and colourful approach of being a pure Orisha-cultus, Umbanda uses in a large extent other spirits in their workings. The Orixas are said to be in the foundation of the Terreiro (umbanda-temple) but the use of saints syncretized with the Orixas are widely used instead of the Orixa proper. Most popular is the working with Caboclos (dead native spirits who were half-hreed-indios with black people), Indios (native Indians from another area than Caboclos), Preto Velhos (old dead slaves), Marinheiros (dead sailors) and so forth. Of these, the Caboclos are probably most popular. A myth suggests that it was a Caboclo, who was the founding reason hehind Umbanda. It is said that the birth of Umbanda happened in a spiritistic seance of Allan Kardec-followers, where a young paralyzed man was possessed by a Caboclo and healed of the paralysis of his legs. He had a prophecy that a new religion would be born in Brazil, named Umbanda. This is one of many legends about the coming of Umbanda. Umbanda functions very much as a resource for help and guidance for the community. The prime focus of the working is on possession and how the possessed priests and his or her assistants are giving advices and c1eansings to the memhers of the community. You might say that the function of counselors and psychologists are taken care of by the spirits. In addition to the advice given, also works of magic can be performed for clients. Often the spirit possessing the Pai or Miie de Santo performs ritual acts to help the members of the community through difficult stages of life and with specific problems, which are resolved either by wise words or ritual acts. Due to the massive diversity and variety of spiritual influx in the Brazilian traditions and religions regarding Orixas, Cahoclos, Exus, Pretos Velhos, Marinheros and so forth there has, in time, appeared systematic segmentations of the spirits. So in regard to Exu, we will find that most Exus arc connected to a line of Orixa. Usually these lines are seven in number with seven Exus in each line. This is to underline that the Sete Potcncias Africanas, or The Seven African Powers are going through these lines as a blood~throbbing nerve, giving them life and direction. By understanding what line an Exu belongs to one can also understand more about the field of working and the use of the particular Exu. Let us for instance take Exu Meia-Noite (Midnight Exu). This Exu we find in the line of Xang6 and this Exu is connected with a Caboclo called Caboclo Xangtl Pedra Preta (Caboclo Shango of the Black Stone). This gives us a hint that this Exu is highly cultivated in the energy of Xangtl, the thunder and fire, being the just judge and the father of the \\Vitches. If one goes deeper into the legends surrounding this particular Exu 251"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":",puzzled as to what extent these two cults are inter-related. It was found that even if they share some important features both in construction and modus operandi, the differences are too severe to support the assumption they are much alike. They are two different streams and the borders should be kept and maintained, even if the \"friendliness\" between these two points of power is high. A palero will have little problem working within the realm of kimbanda, on the grounds of his or her initiation into Palo Mayombe, which in some cases can serve as an initiation of recognition and acceptance within the fold of Exus (but this has to be settled with the Exu directly in a consultation). Workings of possession are the most common format of working, but also the use of trance-states, meditation, prayer are all acceptable modes of working, depending of the purpose. There are however another point that complicates this issue further. There is another segmentation of Exus in regard to working with them. This means that when one approaches a house of Kimbanda for a consultation with Exu concerning one's path in this realm of spiritual influx, one often experiences that there are two Exus mentioned. One Exu is your \"working-Exu\" and the other is your \"personal Exu\". Your personal Exu is the form of Exu attuned with your natural vibration and gives direction to your path and reveals for you your inner nature and quite often is a step into the darker strata of your own souL This Exu should be worked by contemplation and meditation, and given small offerings in order to keep the flame alive. But any spell or work done should be done with the \"working Exu\". Through the working Exu, occult knowledge will be passed on, as from a teacher to the student -like it happened with Sao Cypriano in relation to Exu Meia-Noite. Your Exus are under the supervision of one major influence that fixes the point of this circle firmly in the soul and mind of the \\Vitch. Then we have the delicate subject of Exus wife, Pomba Gira. Not everyone has a personal Pomba Gira or a Pomba Gira working for one's self in the way ofExu. Also, she is much more un-ruling and one should show great care in working with her. Even if Pomba Gira thinks about life, love and sex as a game, you might not experience this in the same way as she does. There have been many accounts of how this Lady of the Blood-black Moon has made her followers' life miserable. This has always been due to a lack of understanding of who she is and, at the same time, the violent attraction she has on her followers. With Pomb<l Gira less is more and caution should be exercised. A common vil'w of her is that she is the wife of Satan (Exu) and a Whore who enjoys \"fucking\" (excuse the wording), this means both \"fucking\" in the sexu<ll sense but also \"fucking\" in terms ')~'),,-:J~ ..."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"of making the life of humans \"fucked up\", usually by sexual means. Some Pai or Mae de Santo will tell you that if you work too much with her, she will turn you into a prostitute and she will turn a man into a transsexual. As this might happen, it is most likely is that overdoing work with Pomba Gira will result in uncomfortable sexual situations, like assault and rape. First hand encounters with this incredibly possessive and attractive deity indicate that this is very true. With Pomba Gira dancing in front of you, this gorgeous radiance can easily inflame quite primitive sexual urges. On the other hand, she can be immensely helpful and honest. When Pomba Gira gives. you advice for your life, she nails your sore points to the marrow and she will indeed help you with whatever issue, as long as you give her the offerings she requested. A personal experience indicates that there is a tight bond between Pomba Gira and Iemanja. In this case, prayer was made to Iemanja, but on the day of working the spell, Pomba Gira possessed celebrating people at the shores of the Ocean. One of the Pomba Giras broke from the dance and came to place the spell for Iemanja was going to be performed and delivered a message from Iemanja concerning this spell. It is tempting to postulate that most Seekers who begin to work with Pomba Gira will usually receive a form of her more akin to Iemanj{l, the caressing mother of the salty Ocean and the wise Mother of the Moon, but as one proceeds and intensifies the work, one will work in a linear fashion where one begins with the embracing mother and ends up with the violent seductress. And let me add, these comments should be heeded as words of caution. Pomba Gira is not for the ones weak of heart, or those with unstable minds. To take this rawness, one must be prepared and one mode of preparation is to walk carefully, always with the lamp enlightening the place where the next step is to be taken. It is widely believed that to work with Exu and Pomba Gira is to work at the left hand of god. Therefore, many practitioners separate the lunar month in two. The first half they work with the left hand and the second with the right hand, to maintain balance within the godhead and to avoid the bad conseLJuences, i.e. a life-situation more challenging that one can bear, of working one's self so deeply into the dark that the torch disappears and fades into eternal night. It seems that this carefulness is not only appropriate but an attitude that maintains the \"feet on the path\" in order to walk forth in the cunning presented on these roads. The roads of worship containing these forces are indeed crossed and twisted, as they run through and between in veins and lines of a fascinating maze.

A goddess reputed to be so fond of the pleasures of the flesh as Pomba Gira will always create a lot of myths and opinions around her, some based on love and understanding, and many based on fear and misconception -and most based upon a missing ability to probe the depths of her form. It is said that it is dangerous to work with her too intensely, since for male devotees she can cause trans-sexuality and sometimes homoerotic desires. It is said that her female devotees can turn into prostitutes or become victims of rape. For both sexes, it is said that she exalts the sexual current in a manner that triggers wayward desires and she brings her devotees to paths so riddled with sexual nerve that the genitalia is speaking and thinking, pushing the head aside. One finds oneself indulging in every carnal impulse, perverse or sane, as long as it is centered on the ecstasy of sexual congress. In other words, since many see her as a divine whore, this is what she turns you into: a whore, who delights in a multitude of lovers and sex for the sake ofsex. And, ofcourse, ifthis is what you expect from her, this is prohably what she will give you. It is rightly assumed that she is playful, and playing with her is like dallying \\vith the DeviL Arc you prepared for this: The other common misconception is that she is the harlot of the Devil and certainly, if this is your approach she will make you her toy, play with you, tease you, make things work for you -just to trick you into uncanny situations just for the Hell of it. Comparing her 255"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"to more western forms of deities or archetypes of sexual colour is to fail her first test. The advice not to overdo work with her, making one vulnerable for sexual assaults should be heeded; this is especially true for women. This is due to the fact that Pomba Gira works directly on the sexual points of the organism and walking around soaked in her energetic form can drawn attention towards her and not the person. This can evoke intense sexual desire and the more primitive and primordial brain begins to overtake, demanding action resulting in an assault. Her presence is like a mist of fire, sometimes vulgar, sometimes serious, but always to the point and incredible wise. My personal take on her is one motivated by deep love and respect, and due to this, I see her as a deity who is excellent in destroying obstacles and problems related to the sexual domain rather than causing such. Very few people arc naturally \"happy hookers\". For most people indulging in whorish behaviour will create more obstacles than it solves, at least when one considers what a powerful exchange of vital essences pa!'i!'iC!'i between two people engaged in sharing their sexuality together. A distance towards one's emotions is usually demanded, if one will indulge in this kind of behaviour with success. Those who claim that such behaviour has been cultivated by working with her might be right in their assumption, but who has been playing with whom! One should be aware of what Pomba Gira can teach us in this respect. The first dilemma is whether she teaches the \"Way of Becoming a Harlot\" or if she is the teacher of the \"Mystery of Human Sexuality\". While the first suggestion is quite common, it is a view reserved for dogmatic devil#fearing people and the masses of ignorant breeders we find in the world her playthings and toys. To consider her as a patroness of the sexual nerve and a wise woman as such is far healthier, and much more correct. Again, those who limit sexuality to the mere act of coitus have missed the point, so please search deep in matters of sexuality and find what its essential qualities arc. The origin ofPomba Gira is found within the religious and magical environment of BraziL The original Pomba Gira, so to speak, was a Congo deity of the Bantu Ewes (the same tribes that practiced what is known today as Palo Mayombe), Bongbogira .. There is nothing indicating that this mysterious deity was a female form ofExu. We can then assume there is a great possibility that the form of a female Exu, under the name of Pomba Gira, was born over a period of time working with Exu. The deity embodying the qualities of deep sensuality and wisdom was found in the -256 "},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"form and mask of Bongbogira, from which the form and name of Pomba Gira consequently came into being. The name she is known by in Brazil is quite fascinating, even if it is obviously a corruption from the original name Bongbogir{l. Pombo(a) means \"a pigeon\" and Gira means \"flying around\". Her corrupted name, then, gives her a mellower form. Noting that pigeons can come in both black and white adds another interesting dimension. The cult of Exu and Pomba Gira is often named as Kimbanda and referred to as the \"dark side\" of Umbanda. Umbanda saw the break of day in the heginning of last century and is a catholicized form of the Orisha-cllltlis. Often blended with Spiritism and mass-possession, it is a kind of charismatic Orisha-cult. The temples, called terreiros, are extremely varied in their competence. It is my belief that there are very few good terrcims and one is lucky finding a good place to cultivate mediumship or one's connection with the spirits. While it is true that Kimbanda has, in a way, become the left-hand reflection of Umhanda, which is very \"white\" and upholds a black/white-dualism (yet usually without demonizing Exu and Pomba Gira), Kimbanda is a cult in its own right. The idea of working Umbanda together with Kimbanda is to make sure one avoids becoming unbalanced to either side, \\vhich is something that one should keep seriously in mind if one decides to work with these deities anyway. In the case of my own hOllse of the cult of Exu, the worship of Exu and Pomba Gira takes pLace in a temple called \"0 Quarto Vermclho\" (The Red Room). In the same place, we also find the \"Munanso Engonda Enketo Ndoki\" of the Changani-order of Palo Mayomhe. While residing in the same location, they are never worked at the same time, even though they probably share the same roots. This is due to the long period of unique development that has happened within the Cult of Exu. It has established itself as a cult in its own right, with its own characteristics. In addition to the work in \"The Red Room\", we also work Ifa (Orisha-cult in its most original and fundamental sense) in a separate location, to maintain a balance of forces. As is the case with the Orishas, Exu and Pomba Gira have different paths, variations of their energy emphasizing different dominant qualities. We can name a few popular Pomba Giras: Pomba Gira Rainha (Queen Pomba Gira), Maria Padilha, Pomba Gira do Cruzeiro (Pomba Gira of the Cross), Pomba Gira Cigana (Gypsy Pomba Gira), Pomba Gira das Almas (Pomba Gira of the Souls), Pomba Gira Sete Saias (Pomba Gira of the Seven Skirts) and Pomba Gira Calunga do Mar (Pomba Gira of the Cemetery in the Ocean). These Pomha Giras again have variations 257"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"of themselves; distinct from Pomba Gira Rainha we have Pomba Gira Rainha do Trono do Inferno (Queen Pomba Gira with Thrones in Hell), Pomba Gira Rainha Cigana (Pomba Gira, Queen of the Gypsies) and so forth. The paths of Pomba Gira are only important when one decides to work closely and personally with her, keen on developing one's natural vibration akin to a specific Pomba Gira. However, the names are not always mentioned, and some people can work for instance with their Pomba Gira Cigana for a lifetime, without her ever revealing which path of Cigana she is. There is power in a name, and sometimes the power is not offered to the devotees, since it is a matter of deep trust from the side of the spirit. The reputations of the different paths are of course inherent in this maze of fascinating cross-workings and patterns. Cigana is said to be vulgar and rude, but an expert in cartomancy, Maria Padilha is said to work fast and precisely, Rainha to be most wise and serious. Depending on the issue at stake in a direct working within her field, one is well advised to seek out the form that is most functional to execute one's aims, or of course work with one's personal Pumba Gira, as it is highly advisable to be clear in one's understanding of who she is before working with her. Pomba Gira will always push her bloodied nails into your most sore points. She will always challenge your pre-conceptions about what she is and prompt you to transgress her mask and form -and she will mirror your sexual distortions, your fears and shadows. This is Her portal and every devotee must pass these ordeals in building a bridge between She and the devotee. If you fail, she will play with you and either eat you, or feed your unworthy carcass to the dogs so that you can be fed upon by your own demons. There has been a tendency to make demonic syncretism between Exus and Pomba Giras and the demons of the grimoires, especially those of Grimorium Verum. We can find for instance that Rainha da Matas (Queen of the Field) is linked with Proserpine, Rainha da Praia (Queen of the Beach/Oceanshore) is linked with Klepoth and Rainha da Calunga Pequena (Queen of the Small Cemetery) is resonant with Lilith. Personally, I think this kind of syncretism is quite correct and hits the vital vein of Pomba Gira's natural essence. Ifyou confront Rainha da Calunga Pequena and fail her tests, the energetic essence many claim to know, but few actually do, \"Lilith\", will feed upon you. Working with the wonderful Pomba Gira is to take a step into one's own shadow, to take one sip of your own poison and turn shadow into enlightenment, poison into nectar.

Whereas this same eneq.,'Y librates the person who is on the path\" -Yoga Spandakarika All things sexual made sacred by intention or items such as candles and smell arc often understood as being sufficient to make the act of sex sacred. By creating an atmosphere experienced to be sacred and call this tantra seem to be often the receipt of sexual magic in the modern western world. There are in particular two attitudes commonly disclosed amongst magicians and \"wanna-be magicians' that would suggest to be produced by distorted views upon sexuality and what makes it sacred. One of these is the idea of woman as merely a receptor for the male power, as a sacred whore, whose magical value is measured by the level of sexual appetite. The other misconception seems to be in regard what makes sex sacred. It is hardly enough to light a candle, a stick of incense and go for it. It is in particular the attitude towards women that will be attended to as there apparently are gross misunderstandings to be found in terms of woman and her receptive and occult nature, thus giving room for a notion of male dominance given its active or solar nature being superior to the female roIc when one is considering terms like harlot and whore which often is associated with the idea of Babalon or the Scarlet Woman or simply Cup. The word it self, harlot or whore seem to have come from the Persian and elder Germanic khoraz or feminine khoron. This word signifies \"one who desire\". In old English and also Old Norse the word transformed into hore, that in the Middle Ages probably contained much more of 260 "},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"its lustful qualities than in modern days Scandinavia where the term is without exception used in degenerative ways as a fornicator, adulteress or a prostitute. The words for a lustful woman and someone who sells their body probably melted together at some point. The word khoraz is found in the Latin carus meaning, \"dear\" and old Persian kama meaning \"desire\", which is also found in Sanskrit denoting the Hindu God of Sexual desire and Love. The word khoron is apparently very different from what we today understand by the term whore in the sense ofa prostitute. Prostitute seem to have been developed from the Latin putidus (which is found in modern Spanish and Portuguese as puta) meaning \"stinking\". It is also related to porne (as in pornography), which carries the meaning of the sexualized body used as an object of trade which is evident in pornes relation to pernemi, \"to sell\". Prostitution in its degenerative use was originally a reference to the purchase offemale slaves for use in prostitution as is made evident considering that the word prostituta literally means \"placed in front\" as a reference to public display. One interesting detail to not but alas, not to be followed in this essay, is the corruption of puta into lupa, meaning a \"she,wolf\". It is interesting to take notice of this corruption as it is found in the Latin festival and also its Sanskrit relative purncalli which means \"one who runs after men\", from the Avestan jahika that simply means \"woman\" -but of an evil disposition. Especially in the later development of the word into ku-nairi that resulted in the label whore from the 13'h Century. The use of the word whore in a demeaning way probably also colored modern mans interpretation of the seventeenth chapter in the Revelation ofJohn in the first six verses where the great Harlot, Babylon is riding ofa dragon drunk on all her fornication. This became a central mystery and one of the most mischievous misunderstandings in the philosophy of Aleister Crowley in his reference to The Scarlet \\Vomal1 or Babalon. Important w note is that Babalon, contrary to Babylon adds up to 156 which is also the number for Zion, the Iloly Mountain, suggesting that there are deeper mysteries at play in the form Babalon. Babalol1. being feminine, passive and receptive is associated with the mystery of the Cup or the Grail (as has become evident in films like \"Revelation\" and books like the \"Da Vinci Code\" where the womb,cup of the bloodline of the Savior is attrihuted to the Grail mystery). As the aforementioned etymological points demonstrate, there is a great difference between \"the nne of desire\" and the woman that has heen sold into prostitution as a slave. The main axis of difference is related to aspiration and freedom. [n Crowley's chapter entitled \"The Cup\" in his magnum opus \"Magick\" 26l"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"he says: \"it is also the cup in the hand of OUR LADY BABALON and the cup of the Sacrament. This Cup is full of bitterness, and of blood, and of intoxication. The understanding of the Magus is his link with the invisible, on the passive side\". Passive in this sense is not a negative reference, but a reference to the female nature as the cosmic contraction associated with the Sephira Binah which Crowley subtly refer to by its name \"Understanding\". This sephirah is in a harmonious relationship \\\\lith the merciful sephirah Chockmah or Knowledge -the sephirah ascribed to the Magus per se. On the Etz Chaim, popularized into the \"Tree of Life\" in western occultism these two sephira are the stations veiled beyond the worlds of manifestation and formation into a spiritual density ofa trembling and blissful nature in front of the throne of the Lord. Babalon is the keeper of the cup of bitterness and blood she is not the cup it self, she holds the bitter dregs, the poison that are cast off by aspiration. The references in the Book of Revelation referring to her adulterous behavior is more likely a reference to her freedom and will, her sublime desire to chose to interact with whomever is of the right desire, with whomever is worthy and fit, as the sixth verse says: \"I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs\". Holiness in it self is not what she is seeking but union, the profane will perish under her kiss if they arc not prepared to sacrifice what they believe to be true and give all of their being to Her. The idea that woman is solely the vessel for the possession of the male, the beast so to say, is merely an illusion and is for sure to go astray and profane one self-and \"perish with the hounds ofhell\". Crowley says toward the end ofhis discussion on the Cup that: \"For human love is an excitement, and not a stilling, ofthe mind; and as it is bound to the individual, only leads to greater trouble in the end\". For as he concludes: \"For each of our ideas must be made to give up the Self to the Beloved, so that we may eventually give up the Self to the Beloved in our turn\". Crowley is simply speaking about the destruction ofindividuality! The many pretenders ofthe Ars Magia Sexualis today often run into profanity by using vulgar understandings of holy ideas. by being unable to differentiate mere pleasure from the divine work of the Cup and the Wand, due to confusion constituted by the fact that the flesh can be used for such diverse ends.. Union with the godhood in the sense of leaving the illusion of dualism in favor of Oneness is the goal for any true mystical discipline, the tools of the body, its tlesh and juices and a direct use of the serpent power than runs through the thousand upon thousand ofnadis (nerves) arc merely one avenue of attainment and perhaps one of the most dangerous ones. No other magical art present the wanderer with such grave dangers of misunderstandings and mere profanizations as the Ars Magia Sexualis. 262 "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"In a world of male dominance, the phallic point of view easily gets adopted and believed in. The world seen from the point of the solar beast will surely lead to a fixation where one search out any \"cup\" that can serve as an object of desire. The cultural background of modern man further makes it difficult to understand the religious and ritual context around the sacrality of sexual acts, they be on a disciplines type as Yoga or as an offering to the deities. in this field we find the idea of the sacred whore, found as far back in history ofman as be performed amongst the Sumerians and Babylonians In both cases this act was sacred unto Militta (Venus), some says that they had to have sex with strangers in this temple as an act of courtesy, probably there was more to this than mere courtesy. This practice was also found on both sides of the Mediterranean and was acts of sacred sex usually in honour of some deity associated with Venus. Another ritually endowed woman is the suvasini or Fragrant Woman (due to her versility in many of the Venusian arts) related to the mystery of the five Ms, the Tantrik Great Rite. The suvasini was well trained in the Ars Magia Sexualis, but the training was motivated by the idea of union with the divine, not charity in favor of pleasing lusting men. Certainly there are many other barriers and blockages (kleshas) the act of sex can help breaking down in a society keen on inspiring neurosis and guilt, but this is something different all together. The suvasini was seen as the embodiment of Shakti (the principle ofcosmic contraction) and the consort as Shiva (the principle of cosmic expansion). The union of these forces would lead to bliss and one would taste the divine amrita flowing like mighty rivers from the golden fountain of divinity. The gates to bliss were made possible only through the power women naturally possess, which is why Shakti is an object of adoration and not carnal lusting. The Ars Magia Sexualis is an art cultivated in order to please Lady Venus in whatever mask she might chose, in whatever garden she might find rest. Another testimony of sacred sexuality is books like Kama Sutra or \"The Treatise of Love\". This book rest upon a foundation of yogic discipline, like all sutras do, but in addition it is also a manual explaining how to please each other in the depths of sensualism and sexuality. A posture of Lusting bodies in various postures solely motivated by enhancing pleasure for the purpose of mere excitement is both troublesome and profane. A greater scope must be extracted and integrated into the sexual act in order to make it sacred. first step towards to the unfolding of this mystery is by sincere adoration ofthe portal to the vast domains ofthe lustful gardens where the realization ofequality and the annihilation of individual desire aimed towards the object must be facilitated. The female body and being is the power that creates the key. This key will unlock the doors between dimensions and thus She is the gate towards God. She holds the cup that gives either slavery or freedom. 263"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":":\\lotes 1 Abbe Boullan was an Abbe in France who became reputed for his sexo­magical work with the abbedissa Marie Chevalier aiming at giving birth, possibly, to the Anti-Christ. ] .K.
