This book is a gospel of Saturn set aflame in the hearts of men, be they blazing in the blood of Asclepius, Dionysus, Vulcan or Hephaestus. This book I give forth to the King, the Queen, their Court and their Ruler. This testament I give to the world in the hope it will serve the world well and in this I give praise to my Elders, be they Ogboni, Imule, Bizango or Sanpwel and give praise to my support and nourishment in this our world of Mystery, Iya Osunkole Eyebonmi Adetutu Iyamisse. By the virtue and grace of Exu Mor, his prophet and the dragon at his root, I will give grace and honour to fine exemplars of the male strain, be they living, dead, immortal or un-dead, men who are divine and brutal in their honesty. May you realise that you are blessed and allow the blessed station of your being to radiate upon the worlds. Now and forever more.I wish to heap disgrace by the virtue of all crossroads of night on those men who are overly aggressive, consumed by egotism, cowards and those overcome by hubris, who are covetous, rude and generally blind to what lies outside their world as they are filled with erroneous justice, ill will and hatred in their self-loathing world of enmity – you know who you are – may you also be blessed in your ignorance as I of-fer up the prayer that the Mothers will embrace you – completely.

I do this because this tome is my testament to Quimbanda and is also revelatory of the measure which spirit has allowed. It is my firm belief that a tradition is only living when it paves the way for a genuine connection with source and spirit. This connection should be so strong and so vivid that the tradition tears itself away from the book and the connection with spirit opens up the truthful and ever living Book of Nature to the pilgrim. When someone insists on a particular expression of Quim-banda being more true or real or genuine than any other, the test rests in the connection made with spirit.This book is my stone in the shoes of many. It is the sweet scent of herbs opening the gates to all quarters of the world. This book is given to you as the vapours of truth, breath, falsity and deception, and in this whips your attention to see the truth as it stretches as a nail from the Pole to Hell. So, I state clearly that this is my vision, but I also claim to have been provoked by spirit in the birth of this text and hence I am simply the scribe of the legions of Quimbanda. They express the pow-ers of the left hand side, what is pale in its darkening and what is both bone and decay.Over the years, both as scholar and practitioner, I have been pre-sented with many differences in opinion concerning Quimbanda and its origin and content. There is such a great variety that at some point you need to accept the variety as its nerve and fire; as its truth. Over the years I have come to see Quimbanda as nests and clusters of serpents, dragons and scorpions all of them spawned by the fire of passion and the sulphuric earth of memory and temporal life. I have come to accept the varieties of the cult as symptomatic of its dynamic, copulative in-ner essence. It is as if Quimbanda replicates the apocryphal legend of Lilith’s banishment to the Red Sea where she daily spawned hundreds of offspring."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ivBeing confronted with the various approaches to understanding Quim-banda I accepted its richness. I dare say that the cult and tradition has been passed on in riddles and fragments amongst genuine mediums and the most sadistic of sorcerers, as much amongst liars and pretenders as those few holding the torch of Phanes in the world.I have been fortunate. I met several Quimbandeiros and Quimban-deiras and was inducted into the cult of Quimbanda in several forms or modalities, ranging from the way it is practiced in a family tradition in Umbanda as well as in Candomblé. From my experience of the various ways of Quimbanda I find a great degree of discrepancy, and in this discrepancy an even greater union, because we are speaking of death, memory and spiritual richness when we speak of Quimbanda. We find legacy along both axes on the cross, and I have ceased to search for a genuine and original Quimbanda because the original Quimbanda is where a true and effective connection with spirit is established; flesh and spirit turns into a crossroad of fire, balancing the pylon against heaven. So in this book about Exu I will, as I did with the mysteries of Pomba Gira, give my rendering of these marvellous debts of death in honour of the kings and generals in the Seven Kingdoms of Exu.There is a tendency to emphasise a particular origin for Quimbanda, in particular the African, by locating it in Angola. It is important to track down our ancestry, because it sheds light and understanding on who we are and sometimes answers the questions about why we are that way. In this way it is no different from any cultural legacy. The origins lie there as memory, as tracks on the map, as wisdom. However, a new culture is different from the culture it sprang from, just as a child grows apart from its parents. It has a past and a future. As such, Quimbanda was born out of the native, African and European paths that crossed in Brazil. As Exu and Pomba Gira venture out in the world they need to get used to new habitats, and we find a mutation and adaptation tak-ing place. There is a lot of resistance towards this process of adaption, but all terreiros state that we are born with an Exu and Pomba Gira which walks with us in life, whether we are aware of this or not. The key lies in providing an unfaltering link between man and spirit so a truthful legacy can be passed on, because the legacy of Quimbanda rests"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"vin man’s nocturnal history and the trials of passion, in the laughter as much as the tears. Quimbanda is a cult that plays itself out on a canvas of human skin still dripping with the blood of memories. It is because these spirits are the most helpful of allies, because of the memory they understand, and because of the same memory and understanding we can turn this mirror upon ourselves and become wise. That is, if we dare. The way towards wisdom suggested by Exu is one of hellfire and brimstone, one of ruthless honesty and bravery, where the most vicious of all enemies is your self.I have in this book, as in the other titles, taken as my measure and source the material published about Quimbanda and black magic be-tween 1940 and 1970 because I feel it is here we find the cult known as Quimbanda in its most vibrant elegant and beautiful expression. Here we find the cult of the streets, mediums of merit and an insistence that a hustler and a prostitute can have as much dignity and saintliness as any nobleman, bishop or sage. Adopting these avenues of Quimbanda also enables a rich depiction of Exu where he can be understood from within Christian mythologies, alchemy and astrology as much as his-torically and culturally. It is my intention to give this, my complete understanding of Exu and his grammar, in this book.With this focus in mind I will return to the knowledge and counsel of masters like N.A. Molina, Aluizio Fontenelle and Antonio Alves side by side with the wisdom and experience of Tatás and Yayas I have met over the last decade. This is naturally mediated through my own expe-riences and understandings of this enigmatic spirit of masculinity and volcanic conquest. So, with this I give this book, this testament and grammar as a gift to the seven legions. May it be received well in all courts by all Kings and Queens and all spirits, baptised and pagan, who guard the ever-burning Fig Tree in Hell.Sarava!Tatá SigatanaCabula Mavambo Ngobodi Nzila"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Black Sun RisingNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.The Gospel of Matthew xxvii: 45 & The Harrowing of Hell: xi"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"iBlack Sun Rising Quimbanda is a cult of earth and fire, a nigromantic cult where death walks the worlds as our friend, ally, or as our nemesis. Quimbanda is a mirror world of our shadows, where we constantly contemplate our own abyss. It is a cult where the legions of Mars play themselves out in the fields of Saturn, manic and in-toxicated by the figs of fire and the sulphuric wines of Venus. As Pomba Gira is the Queen of the cult, the complete mirror of female substance and its variety, so Exu is the King of this cult and the ordeal of every man. In Exu man can witness his flaws and enlighten both his dark-est corners and his highest aspirations. Exu has been demonised and misrepresented for many decades, ranging from him being seen as the evil forces of the netherworld, to being the slave of Orisa, to being seen as identical to the Orisa Èsú – whom he is the slave of! So, in order to define who Exu is with greater precision it is worth evoking Aluizio Fontenelle and his book Exu.Fontenelle defines the class of spiritual beings making up the legions of Quimbanda quite elegantly in the passages where he speaks of spirits as being either evolved or un-evolved. In these passages he also remarks that there is a third class of spirits, whom he calls spirits of darkness. This spirit retinue is understood to be of a liminal type and they are described as spirits of tension that are seen as superior in the world of spirits, being beyond good and evil and with a peculiar interest in maintaining sub-lunar activity. Furthermore, Fontenelle emphasizes the need for building up your own good character, being focused on what is good and at all times being kind and honest. This is because hatred and violence build all too easily when we walk into the territory of these spirits. He states clearly that Quimbanda is black magic (magia negra) which he sees as different from the mirongas of Umbanda with its white magic."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2The Black Roots of Quimbanda Black magic was seen by people like Fontenelle as a fusion of curanderismo, being proficient in herb lore and trafficking with spirits, and feitiçaria meaning sorcery. The technology is quite similar in the macumba of Quimbanda and the mironga of Umban-da, what varies are the spirits employed and the aim of one’s work-ing. These workings are often seen as different from the prayers and sorceries applied by Pretos Velhos (literally Old Blacks, predominantly forced immigrants of Congolese ancestry) and Caboclos (native Indi-ans). This richness is made evident when he comments on the plural legacy of Umbanda and Kardec’s Spiritism by evoking the importance of the Caboclo Penas Brancas (White Feathers) and the Preto Velho Pai Joaquim de Angola. So we find here a cluster of practices that can be black in many senses, and low or high in many senses.This division most likely came through grammars of Solomonic magic brought by Italian and French immigrants and in particular the writings of Eliphas Lévi. It is here we find the distinction between high and low magic. In The Keys to the Mysteries, Lévi comments that high magic is the art that leads man back to the original moral laws. This is a core principle in the theology of Umbanda. So naturally the idea of low magic harks from the same sources and is where we find nigromantic arts like oracular communion with the dead (Necromancy), sorceries of all sorts and spirit trafficking. This magical and ecclesial influence upon Umbanda and Quimbanda is vital because it is in the nocturnal reading of the Holy Scriptures the legends of night unfold upon the canvas where the world is painted with Exu’s magma.Fontenelle was a medium and an Umbandista, so his perspective on Quimbanda was born from the Spiritist Christian dualism so typical for Umbanda where the battle between good and evil is seen as very real. It is important to refer to this time of change in terms of the open-ness of Quimbanda, since in the 1940s there were still severe restric-tions from law enforcement on the practice of black magic and non-Christian religious activities in general. It is however vital that we do not discard the Christian elements related to Quimbanda in favour of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"3some form of centrism. It was, after all, with Umbanda that the wide variety of works with spirits of darkness were recognised as pertaining to a specific realm, and were typified and accepted as a spiritual real-ity. What was quite wonderful with the Umbandistas was the focus on character and their non-judgmental way of interacting with beings, both spiritual and material. These attitudes display how these founding fathers were tied to the French Gnostic Tradition, in particular Martin-ism, with its exaltation of the anonymous philosopher that walks the world and heals in silence, work Lévi would classify as typical for one who works high magic. This attitude generated a loving kindness that enabled a succession of Quimbanda through Umbanda, unfortunately marginalised and demonised by society and seen as a hot and danger-ous, yet necessary mystery for the Umbandistas.In the 1920s a corner to the left outside the Umbanda temple was set aside for the restless spirits of Quimbanda. Here they were given cach-aça, tobacco, blood and praise in the name of spiritual evolution. They were approached as impure and hostile spirits that should be somehow tamed into accepting the moral laws of creation. Possessions by the spirits of the ‘left hand’ were at this time violent, bestial and shocking. Rarely did the spirits speak, but instead answered questions with nods and grunts, though with a few exceptions, as some spirits came through and displayed a maturity and an uncanny knowledge. The relationship with the goetic spirits came into being, and through this the nocturnal history that can be read in the Holy Scripture was fortified. It was as if the French and Italian impulses from the latter part of the 19th century instigated the work that led to the birth of Quimbanda under the wings of Umbanda as a cult in its own right. It is also quite intriguing that the few houses and lineages of Quimbanda succession that claim to be of the root (de raiz) are all turning towards this French influenced noc-turnal reading of the Holy Scriptures. As we proceed in this chapter it will become even more evident and understandable, because in this lies the spirit of heresy and otherness that affirms Quimbanda to be truly a sorcerous cult, a succession of Brazilian Witchcraft based on traditional premises. Again, we can find all this spoken of in Lévi’s Transcendental Magic where we read the following:"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4In black magic, the devil is the great magical agent employed for evil purposes by a perverse will. The old serpent of the legend is nothing else than the Universal Agent, the eternal fire of terrestri-al life, the soul of the earth, and the living centre of hell. We have said that the Astral Light is the receptacle of forms, and these when evoked by reason are produced harmoniously, but when evoked by madness they appear disordered and monstrous: so originated the nightmares of St. Anthony and the phantoms of the Sabbath. Do therefore the evocations of goetia and demonomania produce a practical result? Yes, certainly – one which cannot be contested, one more terrible than could ever be recounted in legends! When anyone invokes the devil with intentional ceremonies, the devil comes and is seen.The Christian elements flow richly within Quimbanda to such an ex-tent that Exu Rei, or King Exu, is directly associated with Lucifer and/or the Lucifer/Satanas polarity. It is popularly seen as a cult of Dia-blerie. Fontenelle uses the Enochian legend of the fall of the apostate angels and their exile as the motive for the beginning of Quimbanda. He even suggests that the name Exu is from the Hebrew term exud, which Fontenelle translates as meaning traitor (in reference to one of the Hebrew tribes). It takes on a similar meaning in Latin in terms of out or exit as in exodus, but can also mean outcast. Here Lucifer’s fall from grace is presented as continuing through the history of man-kind in the form of paganism and sorcery, igniting war, destruction and death. This leads to the Apocalypse where the people of Exu enable this last design of the cosmos to unfold and thus restore Eden upon the earth. The Devil as St. Michael’s warlord executes the divine verdict and becomes the vehicle for salvation. A theme of alchemical and cos-mological importance centres on this story, and within the dominion of Exu, is revealed. At the same time Exu mirrors the world by anchoring his reflection in sin and human activity. These are painted in colours and shades that emphasize the tension between the spiritual and mun-dane, light and darkness, and thus give the illusion of duality so we can fight our own battle towards becoming whole again."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"5The Veiling of Corpses at Midnight The legends of night, as we read in the Gospels, tell us that during the suffering and crucifixion of the son of God the heavenly host gathered around him; and so too did the infernal host. Up until this point the god made flesh denied temptation, denied the myrrh and opium offered to him, denied the wine and water as he gave up his breath on the spear of Longinus.Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, the Pharisee and Sanhedrin member attended his death and saved his blood, sweat and relics. Joseph continued his church, but through Nicodemus a different legacy was maintained. Nicodemus has an apocryphal text ascribed to him, the Gospel of Nicodemus where we find the important section, The Har-rowing of Hell, which describes Christ’s descent to Purgatory and Hell where the Lord of Hell is surprised by his powers. Here we meet the scorn of the angels Belzebub, who has been syncretised with Exu Mor. Exu Mor has in turn has been referred to as the scorn of the angels, he who is spitting at the righteous and the destroyer of the pillars to mention but a few of his names. But his tales go further, and deeper.The apocryphal text tells us that to be hung on a tree, as Jesus did, was reserved for those accursed. So from his crucifixion at the gate of skulls, Golgotha, he opened the infernal and celestial gates at a precise astrological moment where his breath was given to both the above and the below. The Harrowing of Hell demonstrates that the death of Jesus shook Heaven as much as Hell, and that he had to enter into both do-mains to conquer. We are moving far from accepted Christian doctrine here as we venture into the lands of heresy and hidden truth.Joseph and Nicodemus prepared the corpse of Jesus, wrapped it in linen and saved the relics, gathering wood, nails, body parts, and the dirt and flora that shot up through the blood drenched mud on the hill of skulls. Joseph continued the solar legacy of Jesus, but by marrying Mary of Magdalena he assumed the position of ‘guardian of mysteries,’ because woman is God’s secret. Nicodemus held the secret of night and became the precursor of Bishop Cyprian of Antioch, the Saint of Necromancers. Both Nicodemus and Cyprian share the same spiritual"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6afflatus, the same spirit guide, whom in Quimbanda is known as Exu Meia Noite, Midnight Exu. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus are known in Quimbanda as Exu das Duas Cabeças, a Janus type of Exu that binds polarities like the serpents on the Caduceus.With this knowledge revealed, the comments in the Gospel of Luke, corroborated by the Gospel of Mark, emphasising that Jesus was placed in a virgin grave, and the first corpse to be placed in the garden ap-pointed to serve as a cemetery, gains necromantic dimensions. The first body to be buried in a garden transforms the garden into a bone meadow and forms the foundation of the boneyard. The first buried then becomes the king of the bone meadow, placing Jesus the Christ in a most interesting continuum: the mysterious succession of death, resurrection and salvation. From this revelation may those who already know its continuation walk on and those who don’t know be satisfied with the veil of night being shattered in this way. And the shattering is yet another important aspect, because the shattering and rending of the veil of the Temple where the Ark and Covenant were found guarded by cherubim is the secret revealed by a nightly fire held by the spirit guardians of Quimbanda.In the shattering of the temple, its veil torn, we find that particular quality of eruptive and destructive fire so present within Quimbanda. We see here a nocturnal and aggressive fire, a quality which is known as Exu Mor. This spirit has been associated both with the spirit that moved Hiram to build the temple of Solomon and with the fire that led to the destruction of the Temple, being the twin powers of Jachin and Boaz manifested in the blazing candle between the horns of the goat’s head. This fire is in truth the guiding star of Solomon, the King, the goat of wisdom itself, the storehouse of celestial fire blazing between the horned pillars.It follows that Exu Mor’s identification with the icons of the Goat of Mendes and Lévi’s Baphomet is not random, but rather suits this spirit well. In the same manner Exu Meia Noite (Exu Midnight) also gravitates towards physical forms that suit him, those learned in theol-ogy such as a rabbi, a priest or a bishop – or a devil. So, whilst Exu Mor is tied to King Solomon, Exu Meia Noite is tied to St. Cyprian and St."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"8Nicodemus. It follows from this that the spirit of inspiration can be perceived as the diabolic caricature of Pope Alexander VI in a corona of devilish fire.These examples and revelations leave Jesus, or rather his ensouled corpse prepared by the powers of left and right, as the Corpse King of Hell, a Saturnian influence in one sense, but a celestial in another. We find a Sethian ascent spoken of in this mystery, where his breath brought his spirit under the wings of St. Michael, and some even say that he merged with his angelic patron.In this secret matrimony between the draconic Corpse King and its Sun-drenched slayer we find the true identity of the Maioral or Chief of Quimbanda, the angel who threw the dragon out from heaven, be-cause he knew the dragon all too well, and thus the two hands were folded upon the cosmic cross, the serpent fixed and the gates opened.Sol Invictus – Father of the Dead The consequences of this nocturnal legend are quite profound as the crucifixion of Jesus the Christ takes on renewed dimensions explaining a necromantic mystery of supreme importance. It also reveals how Quimbanda affirms the traditional and classical dual bond between the Sun and the Netherworld, an association that harkens back to Egypt and Canaan. In this we find yet another traditional doctrine, namely the importance and interplay between the two luminaries of God, the Sun and the Moon, revealed here in a nigromantic context. I have chosen to use the term nigromantic rather than necromantic be-cause the nigromancer has a wider field of spirit ingress and summon-ing as his field of activity than the necromancer. We are not speaking of solely summoning the dead, but a wider array of spirits and in particu-lar the summoning and binding of familiar and teaching spirits.The two luminaries, Sun and Moon, are the powers that mark the three dramatic hours of the Crucifixion. From the sixth hour (six being a mystical number of the Sun) and until the ninth (mystical number of Moon) an eclipse occurred as the Obsidian Butterfly made the world"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"9dark for three hours. The ninth hour is the time when the Sun enters the realm of Hell and the Moon rises from Hell to give its dim light to the night of sleeping matter. Here we find a great mystery hidden within the number of the Beast of the Apocalypse, 666, Sorath, the solar spirit that inflames the nous, being the spirit of the Sun in its perfection. Six is the Hebrew Vau, the letter of Tiphareth and Beauty. It was in this hour the eclipse happened and darkened the land until it reached the ninth hour, the number of Teth, the Moon and the Sephi-rah Yesod. By the sacrifice of beauty an axis was formed between the world of Formation and the Kingdom. It should also be remarked that six adds up to Dob, meaning bear, and might hint towards the polar position of the constellation of the Bear, the Greater and Lesser, being the Hyperborean mystical Sun and in this the regal nature of the bear as patron of kings. In the same way nine also gives us the word Bo which can mean an entering and to come in and to go down. Even more interest-ing is the fact that nine is the number of squares on the Kamea of Sat-urn, the darkened Sun. It is here we find the metaphysical mystery of the Maioral in Quimbanda being St. Michael the Archangel who, for all purposes, is the Sun transformed into the fire of Saturn, the Dragon. I believe this reasoning explains the solar paternity of notorious witches like Medea and Circe and also why the Book of Coming Forth by Day, the manual for transition to death, is ascribed to the Sun as the ruler of Amenta.Abel is solar, Cain is lunar and thus we have a play here in how the one affirms the other and the ruler of night presents very different rules from those which the Sun gives us. This means that the cemetery is really the Sun slain and it is the skin of the Sun that is draping the Earth and veiling the dead and manifests itself in what we know as the Calunga, the cemetery.The relationship between Exu Rei and St. Michael is one of balanced interaction where the one reflects itself in the other. St. Michael the Archangel was considered a healer and divine physician in the early years of Christianity. Over time the role of judge and warrior took prominence. A similar idea can be found in Quimbanda, which is a cult of healing, composed of warriors. St. Michael is the Sun reflect-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10ing perfectly the darkness of the Maioral and is the angel that restricts and makes possible this dynamic interplay of these solar poles of white nights and dark days. He is the scales in the hand of the Maioral, and this is his ponto: If we turn our attention to Canaan, we find Shamash, the Sun cele-brated as The Lord of the Spirits of the Dead. We are speaking of the Maioral proper, Sol. This is further exemplified in how the Ugaritic Solar kings paid their obedience to Baal and Anath on the New and Full Moon. Here we meet the sun in the form of Shapash, a female de-ity who supports Baal in his might against Mot (Death). We find the concept of the Sun not only being female but going through a state of nigredo where she starts to shine again, but this time with the light of the knowledge of death. Her sister, the deity Kaseph or Keseph, mean-ing silver moon, became a name for Hebrew witchcraft and sorcery today known as keshupherim or keshaphim, an art taught by the Cherubim to Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, the sol niger of the keshaphim (master of the lunar sorceries) and passed on to Moses. We should notice that the worship of Shamash was forbidden in the Tanakh and the penalty was death. So, we might conclude from this that the spirit of Moses moved Jospeh of Arimathea, but Nicodemus was moved by the spirit of Jethro, the Sun shining and the Sun darkened being present in the work of resurrection. In this we find a hidden history of Quimbanda and we gain an idea of who these Exus really are. As we see from this,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"11they are not solely spirits who once walked the earth, some of them are spiritual entities divinely formed that have as their field of activity the earth. This is remarkably similar to the doctrine of the watchers in the Enochian transmissions, and this underlines the nigromantic aspect of Quimbanda as we are speaking of more here than just commun-ion and divination with the dead as is entailed in simple necromancy. De Nigromancia In the light of this, let us look at the rather obscure text De Nigromancia, ascribed to the authorship of Sir Roger Bacon. This text (Sloane ms 3885) dates from the 16th century and is highly interesting as it gives su-preme importance to two of the most important saints in Quimbanda: St. Michael and St. Cyprian. Cornelius Agrippa states that it is possible to ensoul a corpse if the carcass and blood is present and that it is also possible to draw the shades of the soul by vapours, liquors and odours, as well as song, sounds and movement. Whatever moves the soul will potentially move the shades of the soul as well, but without the need for the presence of a corpse or lifeforce offerings. Agrippa makes a distinction here between the ne-cyomancer/necromancer and the sciomancer, the one who calls up the shades of the soul, as the Witch of Endor was reputed to do. Agrippa emphasizes the importance of the presence of body parts and bones, or the geographical location itself. Wherever some form of murder-ous cruelty, death or execution has taken place a point of necromantic power is established and shades can be called up there. Agrippa sum-marizes it thus:Therefore [Necromancers] easily allure the flowing down of wick-ed spirits, being by reason of the similitude and propriety very familiar: by whom the Necromancer strengthened by their help can do very much inhumane and terrestrial things, and kindle un-lawful lusts, cause dreams, diseases, hatred and such like passions, to the which also they can confer the powers of these souls, which"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"12as yet being involved in a moist and turbid spirit, and wandering about their cast bodies, can do the same things that the wicked spirits commit. Another interesting acount from Agrippa is how a soul can be restored to the body, in other words, how to make a golem or how revenants and the undead were made to walk the earth again. He states in this regard that a high degree of perfection is needed in ones election of what harmonies, celestial and terrestrial, or what souls are used to animate a particular body or matter. What our Western sources communicate to us in riddles and enigmas finds a direct sympathy and resonance with the necromantic mysteries preserved in African faiths and in Palo May-ombe. As we see, wickedness walks hand in hand with necromancy, not only because it is sinful to commune with the dead but because the practice also enables the flowing down of wicked spirits, what in Quimbanda are known as kiumbas, and often dubbed shades. Certainly necromancy does invite challenges, so grave that Eliphas Lévi said the following of this nocturnal art:I regard the practice as destructive and dangerous; if it became ha-bitual, neither moral nor physical health would be able to with-stand it. The elderly lady whom I have mentioned, and of whom I had reason to complain subsequently, was a case in point. Despite her asseverations to the contrary, I have no doubt that she was ad-dicted to Necromancy and Goetia. These are dead people whom we mistake for living beings; these are vampires whom we regard as friends.So, we can see that necromancy is truly scary, not only because it works, but because it can lead to addiction to the art and obsession. For Lévi it is important to stress that these shades are not our friends, but vampires. There is much truth in Lévi’s words, albeit presented in fearful terms, and it should be stated that yes, both unhealthy obsession and the energetic draining we know as the effect of vampires are real reasons for caution. I will also testify to the possibility of the flowing"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14down of hostile spirits in our work with shades and bones. It appears to me that there are many spiritual moths out there that are waiting for opportunities to feed at the table of blood and bones within the bone garland. As we proceed in this work, we should learn to be well equipped to deal with these matters, so let us now return to De Nigro-mancia and what it has to tell us about this much maligned art.We find recommendations and observations concerning the moon, which should be increasing in light, her first quarter is considered most auspicious for works of necromancy. Normally one can perform one’s operations and experiments from sunset and until cock’s crow. It is however most auspicious to enter one’s circle or commence one’s work in the hour of Venus. The book also states that the period from sunrise until its zenith holds a particular power, and indeed, this is the time for shaking off the fumes of death and purifying one’s soul and body in order to return to the world of the living. It is also important to avoid impure days and hours. I have in this regard found the Hygromanteia of Solomon to be greatly rewarding for the practitioner. The counsel in De Nigromancia of avoiding unlucky hours and days is to be avoided because of the possibility of activating volneris, simply, a curse. This is especially so if malefica is done in hours that carry a malefic energy in themselves. It is perhaps natural to think that negative works in a nega-tive hour will fortify the working, but it is imperative to be wise here so that a double negative does not lead to inadvertent self-cursing. The book further counsels the fumigation of laurel, the same wood which forms the necromancer’s wand. This is a solar tree, and reminds us that these operations are always better if the Sun is well aspected and favorable with the ruler of the hour we are working with. It reminds us that we bind spirits of air, fire and water differently. For example, if you want to bind spirits of water gather rainwater and place it at the centre of the circle, or do your workings close to running water. Likewise, if our experiment holds a particular planetary value we should make sure that we are working in the planetary hour where we find this particular planetary ray most potent. Most important for De Nigromancia is the 14th of May, the feast day of St. Cyprian. If we see this day side by side with the moveable Holy"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"15Friday, the day of the Lord’s expiation and the three hours where his spirit and breath were moving around over Golgotha, we can see a proc-ess of the volatile dragon becoming fixed. So, this time is naturally most auspicious for works of an initiatic nature as well. Another date given importance is the Sunday of the Myrrh bearers which in the Orthodox Church falls on the 3rd of August and is in honour of Nicodemus, who reddened the bones of the Lord of the graveyard.Another recommendation given in the text is to take a small meal of bread, liver and red wine prior to workings with the dead. This is quite interesting because in several African traditions the liver is believed to be what holds the witches’ power. Likewise the liver held a particular potency in Greek and Roman antiquity where it was favoured for divi-nation. This connection between the liver and its particular power lives on in traditional medicines, such as Ayurveda, where the liver holds the mastery of the five digestive fires that purify the blood. The importance of fire and blood can be seen not only in its importance for health but also on a more symbolic level.If workings are done outside the moon phases spoken of earlier, where one is working with the female planets, Moon and Venus (these timings being optimal for workings with Pomba Gira) the book advises other times, more male in vibration. In general Thursday and Sunday are favoured days, both being ruled by male planets and the circle is en-tered in the hour of Saturn. The summoner should then station himself in the North and their assistants in the South.When the infernal hosts are called, and spirits such as Amazael, Aziel, Anathana, Azael, Tyer, Lucifer, Ashtaroth, Belial, Troglis, it is always done by the virtue of St. Michael, St. Cyprian or King Solomon. Curiously, we find a similar hierarchy in Quimbanda, but with more lenience given in approaching the spirits head on. This is possible when a relationship with one’s Exu and/or Pomba Gira has been established and the secret name has been given. We have then managed to forge a vinculum with spirit that ensures familiarity, guidance and protection and the need for rite and drama is drastically reduced and takes place on a more intimate level. This connection often comes with the gift of second sight, be it in vision, dream, crystal or shade. In Quimbanda this"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"16is a gift given by spirit most often through the frenzy of possession, but there are other ways and means. Let us not forget that some people are simply naturally gifted with this ability.De Nigromancia gives a formula for obtaining second sight that enables one to see the ‘host of Heaven and Hell.’ This formula requires that a viper is killed when the Sun is in Mars. The fangs should be taken and mixed with balsam and mandrake and then be consecrated and steeped in good quality oil in the first hour of the Sun, or during the first degree of the Sun entering Aries. This being done, the snake’s blood (or the blood of bat or lapwing) can be used for calling up the legions of death and wickedness, and equally spirits of healing and wonder working.The death of Jesus replicates the mystery of the two Suns guarded within the Sol Niger. It is here the spirit we know today as Exu Rei, or King Exu, enters and gains the power Jesus gives up at his moment of death. For three hours Exu Rei distributes the breath and blood of Jesus to his legions and replicates the mystery that enabled Lilith to spawn a multitude of demons on the shores of the Red Sea. This power is spread by Exu Meia Noite (Midnight Exu), the spirit teacher of St. Cyprian who gives the power of kingship to a host of Exus.Lastly, there is one stellar connection that should be mentioned: Ori-on. In Hebrew Orion is called Kesilim, which has the value of 120/730, but the numeric value is the same as that for fools. This temurah is not without reason. De Nigromancia takes as its focus the constellation of Orion, because it was here that the leader of the fallen host, Shemyaza was captured and affixed upside down, like the tarot trump The Hanged Man. Orion is the stellar patron of hunters and holder of the secrets that enable angels to be enfleshed. He replicates the mystery of vivify-ing corpses and bringing life to matter in cosmic form. The connec-tion with the hunter stars also connects with certain Exus in the spirit catalogue responsible for opening doors and vinculums. I believe it is here in the image of Orion where the sage and the fool part, the wise one knows how and when to open these doors and possibilities, the fool opens whatever part of the starry hunter that suits his or her fancy with little care for the sorcerous rules and even less spiritual sensitivity. In this is found the divide between the slayer and the slain."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"17The Two Suns & the Fiery Grave of Asclepius Let us return briefly to the alchemical dimensions of Quimbanda, the black sun and the mystery of putrefaction, and afix this corpse in the heavens. Again we need to address the Sun as we see it shedding light upon the earth. Its power is dry and consuming; the fire that makes matter as dry as bones. The philosophical Sun that instigates the nigredo or blackening of matter, the putrefaction, works hand in hand with the calcification of matter where the flesh/matter is made wet and unites with the world soul in the form of the Earth herself. So we find here a mystery speaking of the importance of the consuming and mystical fire of the two suns at work here. It is this mystery that is encoded in the form of St. Michael the Archangel as the Maioral of Quimbanda. This means that Michael himself becomes an alchemical and timeless personification of an eternal mystery, the great work itself, and the restoration of the philosophical sun within that enables and makes possible resurrection and immortality. The Sun rises and finds its peak at midday and then sets out for his journey into the night, this is a mirror of maturity and natural cycles.You gain familiar spirits by workings with the angelic prince Alast-iel. Little is said about this angel, so I assume that his name is from the Latin adjective alatus, which means that which possesses wings. This generic form fits well with Alastor, the vengeful and winged aspect of Zeus often considered to take the shape of a self-afflicted curse. So, this might be read esoterically as the angel prince Alastiel being the power that avenges malefica. This would explain why De Nigromancia states it is crucial to obtain a good rapport with this angel. I see here a simi-larity between the position Scirlin holds in Grimorium Verum and Exu Calunga and the three commanders hold in Quimbanda. This means that the importance of building a good relationship with a certain key spirit is what safeguards one’s sanity and equilibrium in one’s nigro-mantic work. It is the truth of the hermetic axiom as above, so below. An opposite, stellar alchemy takes place in the heavens and mirrors the work the nigromancer does upon and within the earth. It is here that both the stellar Sun and the draconian Helios are revealed."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"18Consider the stars which make up the celestial Hercules. Prior to this identification they were seen as the Chaldean Sun god Izhdubar, as the crown and star upon the head of Tiamat/Draco, which he was con-sidered to have slain. The qualities of Hercules were later transmit-ted onto the constellation Leo by Ovid, which he referred to as the Hercules Lion, the Violent Lion and Bacchus’ light. The transition of Hercules from the dragon slayer of the heavens into the solar heart of the constellation Leo where we find the star Regulus (also known as Cor Leonis or heart of the lion, one of the four royal stars) is replicated in Christian legends of St. George and St. Michael. The solar station is conquered by subduing the dragon and becoming its master. It is also interesting to bring attention to another of the stars in the constellation of Leo, Deneb/Denebola, also known as the tail of the Lion, seen as a fiery and destructive influence bringing misfortune to men, especially those in offices of the state. Denebola served as a regal reminder of the complexity of the royal station.Hercules is to the west of Ophiuchus, the serpent holder, yet another potency standing on the head of Tiamat/Draco, and associated with As-clepius. Ovid mentions Bacchus in relation to the constellation of Leo and we should look at these themes, because in them further depths will be revealed. Asclepius in his power of holding serpents displays dominion, and Bacchus represents the oracular dimensions that take shape in possession and frenzy. So let us first examine the themes of Asclepius and Apollo which can shed light on another dimension of the nature of Exu.In the Gospel of Nicodemus, the Harrowing of Hell, we read that Jesus was accused of throwing out demons in the name of Asclepius. This seems confusing, but as Apollodorus recounts: Asclepius became so skilled in his profession that he not only saved lives but even revived the dead; for he had received from Athena the blood that had coursed through the Gorgon’s veins, the left-side of which he used to destroy people, but that on the right he used for their preservation, which is how he could revive those who had died."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"19Asclepius was the son of Apollo and the princess Coronis (the Crow) who died during labor and was put out to be cremated. Apollo cut his child from the womb of his dead mother, hence the name Asclepius, to cut open, and he was raised by the Titan-blooded centaur Chiron. Chiron was son of the titan Cronos and the nymph Philyra who was turned into the honeysweet Linden tree (Tilia genus) by the jealous Zeus. Chronos passed on virtue and knowledge from the golden age to his wise son Chiron, who in turn passed this knowledge to his foster son. The cunning of the healing arts were so great in Asclepius that he even revived the dead, and thus Zeus vanquished him with a thunder-bolt for upsetting the natural order.Concerning the death of Asclepius, who was turned into stars by the work of the thunderbolt, we should note that he was instantly deified. This is a phenomena we find in the cult of Quimbanda and in Brazilian folklore in general. Those who undergo immediate transfiguration are known as encantados, charmed ones who vanish in nature and remain in proximity to the earth as Masters and Teachers of certain people or small communities. The cult of Catimbó is particularly rich with these spiritual phenomena, but some Exus are also encantados and are therefore known as catiços. The Exu catiços are understood to be dif-ferent from the Exus we will discuss in this book. The catiços are seen as spirits of nature that reveal themselves like Exus and call themselves by names of Exu, but they are not guardians of particular places of powers, rather they are forces of power born from nature itself. These Exu catiços are generally more violent than the classical Exus and must be directed with diligence to avoid harm to the medium.Asclepius did not die, but vanished immediately into the nature he knew so well and was transformed into a cluster of stars known as the Serpent holder. His mother Coronis was also brought to the heavens in the form of the constellation Corvis who rides on Hydra’s back. This is the star at Apollo’s left shoulder. At his right we find the star Vega, brightest star in the Harp who holds the powers of Venus, often called Queen of Life, though prone to debauchery and sloth. This means that Apollo merged with Daphne, the nymph that was his first and true love and together they have the laurel as their symbolon, a union of Sun"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"20and Moon. The raven is one of the attributes of the solar and oracular Apollo, who also holds in his hand a Harp, the constellation next to Hercules.The Harp is the constellation that holds the necromantic mysteries of Orpheus, his descent to Hades and his decapitated head coming ashore on the island of Lesbos. Its brightest star is Vega, which is the soul of Eurydice. Orpheus’ head entered the land of women, Lesbos, after fail-ing to rescue his beloved. Mystically the one beloved turned into the many beloved, and the lover of ‘One’ became the precious one of many. In this we find the intense relationship between the royal Exu guarding Pomba Gira, the Fig Tree in Hell, the woman of Seven Husbands.It is my belief that Asclepius represents the archetypical first nec-romancer and it is this theme that is transmitted in the form of St. Cyprian. Apollo however holds the keys to a deep necromantic mystery where he holds the laurel staff and the Harp. The fact that Apollo is given Orpheus’ gift and soul denotes his mastery of this journey to and fro in the halls of Death. There is however an interesting discrepancy here concerning Apollo’s oracular pedigree. I tend to find Apollodorus in general more truthful and I am inclined to agree with him that this gift was given to him by Pan, and not by his father Zeus. Pan giving the grace of prophecy harmonises better with the serpentine mysteries that we find entwined in the oracular process itself. Python possessed this oracle, but Python was merely the mouth and tongue of Gaea (earth) and Poseidon (oceans). If we should dare to make a comparison within the legions of Quimbanda we find Exu Calunga, who draws heavily on the themes of Saci or Aroni to be the most likely of the portents of the powers of Pan, and through this Exu Calunga that carries their form. Saci is a midget trickster spirit that ensures movement in the woods. Aroni is the dogheaded messenger of Osanyin, the spirit of the forest. Both are ascribed the power of forcing the hand of chance. More will be said of them when we present the mysteries of Exu Calunga. Exu Calunga holds a prime position as a nucleus of power that he flung out above and below as a maelstrom empowering his 18 legions of Exus."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"21Exu & the Death of Bacchus When we bring Bacchus/Dionysus into this equation it is because of his death and descent to Hades which forges his connection with Haephestus/Vulcan, thus we come full circle with the relationship between the Sun, Asclepius, Hephaestus and the themes of death and dominion they represent in relation to the fires of Hades and the ecstasies of the night.Vulcan was a limping god. The limping is said in Homer’s Iliad to be due to his fall from Olympus when his mother Hera beheld his ugli-ness. The Iliad also states that his limping was caused by his father Zeus throwing him down on the island of Lemnos after he sided with his mother in a dispute. He was brought up in an underwater cave where for nine years he was an apprentice of the arts of the blacksmith and jeweller. He was raised by the aquatic Titaness Tethys and the mother of mermaids, Eurynome. He is perhaps best remembered for his tur-bulent relationship with Aphrodite/Venus, his wife, who was repelled by his ugliness.There are several features here that reveal Exu themes. Firstly we have the limping, a quality ascribed to the devil but also as a sign of fall-ing in itself. Hence we will know that an angel is fallen by its limping as much as we will realize that something has broken through from the other side by its limping gait. This theme is evident in the iconography of Exu where he is depicted with one human foot and one cloven hoof. It is also interesting to take note of the aquatic cave being the cradle for Vulcan in this regard. The deepest points of the ocean are in African faiths always associated with mystery and ancestry. Not only this, but as the oceans have the peculiar ability of eating light and not giving any back, the logical consequence will be darkness upon darkness, yet we find a curios metamorphosis taking place. The deeper we go and the less light we find, the more aquatic creatures generate their own light and their shapes become more and more outlandish and deformed. So, we find here a mystery speaking of how we can forge our own light in the field of ancestry and mystery, and I believe this is a trait of Vulcan we can apply to Exu."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"22Exu shares common themes with Dionysus as well as Hephaestus/Vul-can. Not only do they all bring the fire of immortality from Hades, sto-len from heaven and thus manifest ecstasy and sorcery, there are several other factors that can help us understand this intriguing devil known as Exu. Dionysus was the one who brought Hephaestus back to Olympus, riding on a donkey, like Jesus did. This speaks of the intense relation-ship between the two outcast gods.If we look closer at the substance that makes up Dionysus we find a relationship with Vulcan/Hephaestus. This is the fire at the centre of the world, or the flames in the netherworld. This theme is further stressed by Vulcan’s wife Aphrodite behaving freely in sexual matters. We might see a ‘wet’ form of Vulcan in Dionysus. It is the earthy fire of the netherworld transformed into a moist fire of the heavens, where he is the mediator between his solar and lunar self properly identified with the star that dies and rises in the course of night, namely Venus. These considerations are important, because it sheds light on why the fiery and hot spirits of Quimbanda are called Exus. It is here we find the connection and subsequent forgetfulness about the reasoning be-hind it. The explanation is quite simple, since the spirits that make up Quimbanda are considered hot and unpredictable, a stabilizing element that could serve as the opener and closer of gates and crossroads would be ideal. The perfect candidate was the Orisa Èsú, the linguist of the worlds, dweller at crossroads, friend of wisdom and psychopomp. So, at some point it became customary to be initiated to the cult of Èsú in order to safeguard oneself and stabilise one’s own practice with these volatile spirits of fire and night. The Orisa Èsú was gradually seen as the power that kept these forces in some form of order and thus these spirits multiplied, in conformity with the linguistic nature of Èsú, into legions and lines of spirits assembled from the netherworld, nature and the heavens. Today this legacy is in danger of becoming forgotten, yet in this we find the reason for Exu being the male potency of the cult. It is in the borrowings from the Yoruban cult of Èsú that are found both the foundation of Quimbanda and its understanding of Exu. This is visible in some form of ebó (sacrifice/offerings). The construction of the spirit vessels however is reminiscent of the cult of Osanyin and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"23Kongolose derived mysteries, such as Palo Mayombe. This is mediated and fused with native Brazilian, Kongolese and European practices and concepts leading me to conclude that we can hardly say that one form of Quimbanda is more valid or more connected to the root than any other, as diversity is its very nature. The importance lies in whether we are truly connected to spirit or not, because in this lies the key to who is riding who.Every person alive is said to walk in the company of an Exu and a Pomba Gira. Consequently these spirits represent the essential quality of the soul and can manifest as what we know as lares, household gods, for good or for ill. Most Exus and Pomba Giras were once living beings that upon losing their shell contracted into a spiritual quality of some form. The form they were shaped into was still drawn to matter and hence resonates with the works of the human soul here on earth.Since humans are more and more preoccupied with being more unique than what our unique being dictates, this generates an equal illusion on the other side of the mirror of the world of souls. From this merging of will crashing in the mirror between the worlds are born odd spirit characters, variations within the variations. We can find Exus with odd names, like ‘baking oven’ and ‘Japanese sailor.’ The presence of such spirit forms speak of a human desire to be different and unique, and how the fertile field of this cult is in giving birth to new spirits and discovering old ones. In this we find challenges that lead to growth. These matters are also caused by the many complex factors involved in the mechanism of possession. For now I will only state that it is important to keep in mind that Quimbanda carries a story of a cultural and historical forgetfulness within its constant renewal and recreation.Necromancy certainly has its root in ancestor veneration and might be said to give us an opportunity to forge a spiritual ancestry through earth, blood and prayer, a work of sympathy where kindred souls on both sides of the veil make bonds. In this we need to show caution. As we do not have an intense harmony with every kind of person, so it is in the world of spirits. As above, so below. Some spirits are prone to harm and contempt the human race. But, more of this as the book pro-ceeds. At this point we shall pause and bring all these threads together"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"24and let these threads find Africa in the Venusian lands of Vera Cruz, also known as Brazil. Naturally they shall find each other in the ecstasy of wine, the tearing of flesh and its renewal as death, plants and earth are given a voice. Quimbanda is a necromantic cult and all necromantic cults have an intense relationship not only with fire, but with the Sun as well as the Moon. In Quimbanda the two luminaries of heaven, Sun and the Moon, are given to Exu and Pomba Gira respectively, but its mystery spreads its wings to the eight corners of Hades. On Obsidian Wings There is one other aspect in the theme of the black sun and dual sun that should be mentioned as the chapter moves towards its close. In Aztec mythology we find the tale of Quetzalcoatl, the feathered Serpent, a most proper alchemical symbol in the form adopted. At sunset this deity took on the form of the black sun, going through a metamorphosis of night, and as the black sun venturing through the nights of the netherworld did so as a butterfly. This finds resonance in Brazilian, European and African beliefs of the firefly and the moth being spirit presences, one higher and loftier than the other. The butterfly is also frequently considered in contemporary occultism to represent the soul, and naturally the dramatic metamorphosis of the butterfly gives us much to contemplate. This butterfly was amongst the Azetcs seen as made of obsidian, a mineral extremely sacred to certain forms of Exu, and was called Itzpapalotl. The Aztec worldview counted nine layers to the netherworld, taking the earth’s surface as the first where descent to the others was made possible by entering the mouth of a giant toad. These nine layers harmonise with the ninefold division of places of power within the seven kingdoms that will be used in this grammar to present the many Exus.In this we find an opposition and a play upon contrasts as Quetzal-coatl is also opposed to the forces of the Tzitzimime and the Cihua-teteo. The butterfly he becomes in his night travels is usually consid-ered a solar orange. He is the monarch butterfly, which is a symbol of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"25warriors who have died in battle, who carry the Sun on their backs from sunrise to sunset. Itzpapalotl carries the sun from noon to sunset.Itzapapalotl was given rulership of a paradise world seen as the cra-dle of human creation, the place where the souls of children dying be-fore their first year came, as well as women who died during labour. She is the mother of the moth and can show herself as a deer, as a bat or scorpion, hence her name sometimes being the butterfly with claws and the symbolic association between nocturnal butterflies and bats. Beside the butterfly form and the obsidian attribute, she is seen as a skeleton and a warrioress manifesting in solar eclipses. When she takes on her deer woman form it is to seduce men or mate with serpent spir-its. Besides toads and scorpions she is also reputed to show herself as a masked white woman, with jaguar hands and eagle feet, cloaked and veiled. It is an evil and murderous energy. She is a defender of women and feeds upon men. This relates to mysteries pertaining to the Pomba Gira known as the Fig Tree in Hell and Exus like Asa Negra (Exu Black Wings) and Morçego (Bat). All these animals are crucial to working the cult of Quimbanda. It is a cult of nocturnal birds and amphibians, of creatures that cross water and earth and thrive upon fire and poison and hence I shall close with some observations in the form of a warning.The Scorpions in the Track The king of the cult of exu is a most proper icon of change, exchange and transformation that can turn the suffering road of human existence into solace and triumph. I would say, as much as Pomba Gira is the solace of the world, Exu is the power of triumph. Triumph calls upon its own shadows of hubris, pride, solipsism and revenge. The shadow of triumph however is failure, and in failure we can start to nurture the most negative of all poisons; hatred and anger. In failure, anger and hatred take shape and when this ugly fire is too much to carry we project this outwards and the entire world is coloured by our sick vision."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"26Quite correctly and in conformity with its delicate gnosis few people are capable of dealing with this often unnatural infernal fire, hence they see only the poison, and they ingest this poison. They turn into scorpions, but not the kind of scorpions that stretch their axes up and down to the left and to the right, but instead generate a hard, dark shell around their soul and condense all their poison in the act of mak-ing a point, no matter how absurd, wasted, ridiculous or whatever. It seems to me that this is a mechanism contained within the poison itself and our reaction dictates whether we alchemise it or perish at its sting. When poisoning occurs we need to heal it. The best remedy is to work on our character and realize that poison can make a man immune, or a corpse. The path of poisonous fire is for the real man or woman, who in the fire of Hell turns gentle and understanding; who grows wise through suffering and ordeal, who sees themself as a warrior ready to accept life no matter what its cost. It is indeed the path of a dark knight, a poisonous path that either gives you the armour of a knight or the carapace of a scorpion."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Truth is not a mere copy of reality: it is always dynamic, involved in action.Roger Bastide"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"iiThe King of the City of Dust The history of quimbanda is forged in forgetfulness, nostalgia and rebellious turmoil. It is a cult that has changed and adapted over the centuries under various names and ritual forms. The truth of Quimbanda rests in the dynamic interaction it always had with its land and people. Tracing the historical patterns that lead to modern day expressions of Quimbanda takes its toll. We need to consider several different forms of folklore across Brazil, social changes, and geographical variations. History is a fragile discipline as it aims towards explaining so much from assembling facts in the form of historical occurrences that hold meaning and significance. This demands a good analytical mind for the qualified assumption of meaning that lies at the heart of history. I draw upon the research of Roger Bastide, who in turn used the illuminating research of L.A. Costa Pinto, Nina Rodrigues and Gilberto Freyre. Perhaps the first dignified study of black cultures and macumba in Brazil was made as late as 1901 by Raimundo Nina Rodrigues who tried to counter the successive denigration of black culture in Brazil, yet Bastide, in spite of his ‘racial’ flaw is a vital avenue for approaching this subject matter. Bastide constantly stresses the problem of cultural memory and its forgetfulness, which I feel is crucial for a study of the historical provenance of Quimbanda.Social turbulence lies at Quimbanda’s roots. In 1611 there were dis-cussions about making Native Brazilians free men and women, but not until 1789 was this promise made good. A far worse fate befell the Af-ricans who were declared free men and women as late as 1888, and this after much international pressure. In all fairness it should be pointed out that the tutor of the Emperor and patriarch of independence the Freemason José Bonifácio remarked in 1823 that slavery was a mortal cancer in the country. Slave traffic was forbidden in 1850 and in 1871 the ‘law of the free womb’ saw its manifestation. This law stated that children born of slaves from that date on were to be considered free. In 1889 Brazil changed from crown property to fledgling republic. The first republic was riddled with scandals, oppression and tyranny."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"29The Belle Époque overlapped both crown and republic lasting from 1870 until 1930. This was a period of French and continental influence on art, music, philosophy and literature. With this beautiful epoch came the ugliness of Social Darwinism and the Africans, Cafuzos, Caboclos, essentially anyone with a non-European heritage, were discriminated against. In the same period we find black movements, Caboclo move-ments and the founding of Umbanda as Kardec’s Spiritism spread rap-idly through the urban centres of Brazil. The attempts at vanquishing African roots only made them stronger and it was a time where Quim-banda took the form which we know it in today, as a conglomerate of African and native wisdom oriented around a Kongo cosmology with greater or lesser influences from Spiritism. It is this conglomerate of impulses, rebellion and social turmoil that lie as tender nerves in what is known as Quimbanda de Raiz, that is, Quimbanda of the Root.In 1930 the military staged a coup and stayed in control of Brazil until 1985. In 1985 the first democratic election was held and Tancredo Neves was elected and assassinated, as popular belief holds, making way for Sarney (who allegedly supported the military regime) to be the first president in what is known as the new republic. From here a democratic and social agenda took shape. It was only as late as 1988 that laws crimi-nalizing racism and sexism were put in place in Brazil.The Devil of the Cabulas The account of the papal representative Dom João Nery in Espírito Santo tells us that macumba was used interchangeably with the word calundus. Calundus were described as sortilegious celebra-tions predominantly of a double black concentration, due to both the presence of Africans and because of the black and diabolic nature of their rites and magic. In accounts and descriptions from the 17th cen-tury onwards we find recurring mention of the calundeiros celebrat-ing a spirit known as Calunga Ngombe. Interestingly ngombe is a term referring to a Congolese dialect, and also a name given to the class of mediums and diviners in the same district. Calunga signifies both the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"30abysmal waters of ancestry as well as the mysterious ocean itself. The practice of the calundeiros took place in calundos, nefarious and eerie compounds. Their practices were described as a fusion between black magic, spirit possession and Masonry of an African temperament. The term itself is derived from the North-Angolan city Calunda, but was used as reference to the slave compounds themselves. From the Calun-das surfaced Cabulas, which we might consider the spiritual structure from within the Calundas. The Cabulas observed a traditional African hierarchy and structure whereas the cult was headed by a chief of the cult, called embanda. He was assisted by a cambono. The cambono was the master of ceremonies and appointed to be the General of the ritu-al, to ensure that everything proceeded in a safe and orderly fashion. The meetings were known as enjiras and those attending were usually dressed in white. They called upon Calunga (the ocean and potency of prophecy), Baculo (ancestors) and Tatá (disincarnated masters and teaching spirits). The goal of the rituals was to enter into trance and commune with spirit guides in order to secure protection and un-derstanding. Bastide points out that Tatá came in many guises, such as Tatá Guerreiro (Father Warrior), Tatá Flor de Carunga (Father of the flower of Calunga), Tatá Rompe Serra (Father who breaks hills), Tatá Rompe-Ponte (Father who breaks bridges) and so forth. Macumba originally referred to the drum used in the enjiras. Gradually the term macumba fused with Cabula.As macumba became more known and written about, the terms Tatá, Pai and Mestre became conflated to refer to the head of the cult, both physical and discarnate. The same structure as was common in cabulas and amongst the calundeiros continued under various guises, under the general label of macumba until the 19th century when it was gradually referred to as Quimbanda in reference to the practices of the cabulas. At the turn of the previous century the use of the term macumba held a distinctively African or Kongolese flavour, but with an air of black magic following it like a shadow.The bad reputation of macumba is partly explained by the applica-tion of magical and sorcerous solutions to deal with very real problems of abuse, hardship and suppression. The macumbeiros appealed for"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"31the help of those spirits who could open roads and break down their oppressors. It is also important to pay attention to the ecclesiastical schisms in the 15th and 16th centuries when Northern Protestant Chris-tianity distanced itself from what they saw as a Satanic Christianity in the Catholic Church. From this point on the Devil gained prominence and it naturally gave cause for concern, as it demonstrated that the Devil was able to divide the house of God. Prior to the reformation the power of the church was considered to be so strong that man had nothing to fear from the myriad of devils around him. With reformation, schism and ecclesiastical unrest, this perspective became rapidly altered and in the 17th century the devils lead by a supreme Devil became a real threat. Hence the Devil as enemy of the Church was gradually seen as a source of power, and a possible friend, of the calundeiros and macumbeiros.These are the formative decades of Exu’s diabolic iconography. As the Devil became more and more evil, that is, a threat to the white slave owners, the more the oppressed people, either exiled from Europe or imported from Africa, saw in the enemy of their oppressors a friend. Bastide commenting on this diabolic syncretism notes that the Yoruba Èsú was a natural and perfect form for merging these native and Kon-golese spirits into a protective intermediary between God and men. Af-ter all, the spirits they summoned in their rituals were often spirits of healing, war, opportunity and attack, and none was better suited than Èsú to bring these requests to the feet of Nzambi (God). It looks as if the merging of the crossroad spirits of macumba and the Yoruba in-tercessor Èsú was a gradual process that began in the early 19th century with them emerging as identical with the birth of Umbanda. There are even examples of notorious Quimbandeiros in the 1970s going to Ketu, Nigeria to make initiation to Orisa Èsú to give maximum support to their work with Quimbanda. Èsú was seen as being not only the in-termediary between God and men, but also between the Infernal and men. Èsú was considered to hold a neutral role, mediating the angelic choirs and the legions of Hell. From this the epitaph Exu was given to the myriad of spirits from crossroads, streets, lines and kingdoms that found their way into the structures of Quimbanda. This was all helped by the fact that the Orisa Èsú was being translated as devil and Satan in"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"32the first English/Yoruba dictionaries, and is a translation which is still given today.Another consequence of the Orisa Èsú being given such a pivotal role was that this Yoruba Orisa was seen as a social force capable of re-solving cultural conflicts. Exu became a fusion of the Kongo fire spirit Kadiempemba and the Yoruba Èsú veiled in the guise of continental demonology and Spiritism. Exu of Quimbanda rose as the equilibrium that united the negative or Bantu legacy and the positive, the Nagô/Yoruba legacy.It should be pointed out early on that there is no such thing as African dualism or any Manichean idea behind any African faith or theological concept, unless it is for the sake of allegory. Where we see what might be considered dualism we will also see that such a state is a deviation from the natural order where everything is seen as rays and extension of a singular creative principle, a wise origin of all things. This contrast and possibility invested in the One, the source, is found in all spiritual manifestations be they, plant, beast, man or gods. Everything that is, is an extension of the source. Everything is paradoxical and ambivalent, and most ambivalent of all are mercurial principles like Èsú.African spirits are always understood as natural principles, qualities are commonly ascribed to the principle giving how, where and why they appear and act. They are all dynamic, but for some this can be understood as arising from an ambivalence at the spiritual centre of the principle. In effect this means that a spirit can manifest and work across a great array of possibilities. In the case of Exu, it was his function as opener of roads, intermediary, linguist and sorcerer that was empha-sized and thus it was within these qualities the spirit host took shape. The aggressive fire was likewise given constant attention in the rebel-lion against slave owners. So the protector of the Africans became the white man’s poisoner, killer and a sorcerer. Through social need Èsú gained a following that broke the limits of his people and became more a general force, a god for the oppressed, for criminals and outlaws. Èsú became the conglomerate known as Exu. All these associations devel-oped between the 17th and 19th centuries. We also see a cultural overspill where the Yoruba Èsú is venerated as Exu by people claiming Bantu"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"33heritage in the macumba houses in Rio de Janeiro as attested to by Bastide in the late 19th century. Here the most significant being to make ebó and give padé and eko to was Exu, a clearly Yoruban influence. We also see that Yoruba and Bantu ideas are conflated to such an extent that it is as if the malefic and protective aspect of Èsú have taken on a life of their own in their merging with the European Devil as the Exu of Quimbanda took shape. Exu rose out of the fertile Brazilian soil soaked in blood and sweat before setting forth on wings of sorcery and attack.The Septenary Roots of Macumba With the abolition of slavery macumba flourished. The mutually cruel fate in being both abandoned and left on the streets generated kin bonds of sodality between those who had been freed. In particular in Salvador, Bahia and in Rio de Janeiro, a rapid and powerful growth of houses of macumba took place. These were in effect successors of the cabulas, but now with an increasingly European influence which had been brought to the larger cities during the Belle Époque. Exu and his cult become endowed with a multifarious legacy of magical knowledge of indigenous, African and European pedigree. In this melting pot the European Devil turned into a sort of tutelary spirit for the macumbeiros as they continued the enjiras of the cabulas, but now with the book of St. Cyprian and Spiritist techniques in their magical arsenal. Bastide recounts that some believed that the followers of St. Cyprian were able to transform themselves into were-animals and St. Cyprian was taken as a patron of black magic. Black magic (magia negra) was used interchangeably with macumba. From this melting pot Quimbanda grew, and because of this we find that Quimbanda is a variation upon a diabolic theme mediated in shades of white, red and black and the iconography tells the story of how the devil befriends the oppressed.Èsú entered into this calculation and synthesis because he was mes-senger and intermediary, he was transformation, magic, and the qual-ities of the European devil were interpreted in these very terms. In"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"34the same timespan we see another Yoruba Orisa entering the realm of macumba, Omolu, testifying to an explosive exchange of wisdom and knowledge. Omolu is the owner of earth, sickness, healing and those who succumbed to smallpox. Omolu was thus adopted as the owner of the Cemetery.The period from 1870 to 1920 was marked by a great interchange be-tween magicians and sorcerers informing the multiplicity of macumba and therefore, Quimbanda. In the aftermath of the abolition of slavery a wave of French homeopaths and Spiritists descended on the urban centers in Brazil, in particular Salvador, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre. With this French bourgeois culture came neo-paganism, neo-hedonism and decadence. With them were also the books of J.K. Huysmans and the romantic Satanism which had a greater social impact than is generally remembered. Huysman’s À Rebours and Là Bas were published in Brazil in the 1890s and made a great impression on Masons and Rosicrucians who were intrigued by the descriptions of the black masses. The process garnered support from intellectuals like Teixeira Werneck and Eduardo do Campos, who propogated this romantic Sa-tanism in their intellectual circles. Naturally, these impulses coloured Quimbanda as the movement gave added pathos to the diabolic imagery of Exu. Stefania Capone (2004) concludes in her study that macumba incorporated and reinterpreted European beliefs in conformity with an African worldview. I find this observation to be profoundly cor-rect, and this observation also explains the current tendencies amongst Quimbandeiros to disagree about the origin of the cult. The roots are metaphorically Seven.Quimbanda tell the story of oppression and rebellion, the split be-tween the slaves and their owners, as well as the split within the African population itself which became even more complex when children of double heritage were born. I refer those interested to the monumental work of Gilberto Freyre, Casa Grande e Senzala (1933) which over the course of two volumes details with great insight the complex position of the freed slave in a restrictive society which needs to adjust to the changes. It is here we find social discourse concerning the possibility of the ‘barbaric’ black man evolving towards the ‘dignity’ of the white"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"35man. Imagine the reactions when such questions were posed for discus-sion and debate! Some freed slaves set out to demonstrate the affirma-tive in this proposition, others rebelled with an even greater hatred. Conflict and ambivalence followed in an attempt to set the scales right. In 1863 Spiritism arrived in Brazil and not long after we find low spiritism taking shape. This low spiritism recognized two lines of ema-nating dead, which were respectively the Indian line (Caboclos) and the African line. The low spiritism was called this, both because of the type of spirits called upon and the more rustic (read: African/Black) forms of possession and trance that took place. The label low spiritism reflected the French idea of a high and low magic distinction, cour-tesy of Eliphas Lévi. The spirits that were worked within the African line were called Pretos Velhos, or Old Blacks, being the African ances-tors looking after their living descendants. These could come through their mediums in benevolent forms like Pai João or the more vengeful ones like Pai Joaquim and Pai Kongo. This low spiritism is important to mention because it rapidly took shape on its own terms in the houses of macumba where native, African and ‘pagan’ spirits gained prime im-portance in the cult. The purpose of the work was always attack, pro-tection and guidance.The establishment of spirit lines crystallised Quimbanda from Um-banda. Spiritism was actually welcomed by many of a Kongo heritage as a way of reconnecting with their ancestors in a new way. It is known that the word Umbanda is derived from the kimbundu ymbanda which roughly means chief healer, used both as a verb and as a noun. Likewise the word quimbanda was originally a noun, referring to the chief healer, but can also mean medicine in a general and spiritual sense. The split between Umbanda and Quimbanda is noted for the first time in the macumba houses of Rio, where the macumbeiros of black and mixed ancestry, according to Bastide, simply accepted the constant accusations of being evil and embraced Exu as the king of the reign of terror and embraced his sorcerous legacy. Here the lines and legions of crossroad spirits from Hell, and Omolu and his armies of death from the cem-eteries of cultural memory and forgetfulness seep in. Quimbanda rep-resents a particular heritage that finds itself with one foot in Africa,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"36the other in Europe and with a soul in ancestral memory. This should also suggest that the terms Umbanda and Quimbanda were in use long before Zélio was instructed in 1920 to establish Umbanda under the guidance of the Caboclo das Sete Encruzilhadas (Caboclo of the Seven Crossroads).In the 15th century expedition to the Congo, King João of Portugal brought a version of the European feudal system with him, albeit in miniature. In this first foray he sent priests, philosophers, teachers, and farmers, representatives of all the social classes, with the aim of spread-ing Western style civilisation amongst the Africans. He also took some key Congolese back to Portugal to educate them and reinstall them into their original societies and thus establish them as part of a fledg-ling aristocracy. In this vein we see the first manikongo (the King of Congo) Nzinga Mbemba, who was sent to the Vatican and returned to the Congo with the Bishopric name Dom Henrique I in 1521. This might have seemed a clever plan of indoctrination, but the Congolese behaved in unexpected ways and Africanised the Christianity that the Portuguese were trying to impose. This was immensely frustrating for the colonisers. Controversy and superstition abided and no matter how much the Portuguese crown and the emissaries of the Vatican tried to educate them, the Bantu and Congo were considered incapable of the right form of veneration and religion. For the Congolese the Church, the cross, the prayers, the songs, the holy book were all nkisi, that is, medicine, a power for curing or healing, or for accomplishing their ends. This worldview that early anthropologists like Tyler saw as primi-tive animism was considered rustic and barbaric. The African continent was understood as a remnant of religion and culture from an earlier stage in human evolution. This coupled with the diabolic superstitions imposed upon Africans, both by the white man’s observation of his behavior, language and skin colour created the cultural frustration that infuses Quimbanda."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"37Sorcerous Healing It is commonly believed that the Portuguese mission in Congo was a cruel one and that the Africans were forced to convert. However, the cruelty came later, and this is documented extensively in my book Palo Mayombe – the Garden of Blood & Bones. In some cases they were forced to receive baptism before embarking on the ships that took them to the New World, but mainly the mission in Congo was one of seduction. The missionaries at first allowed the Africans to maintain their traditional perspectives upon the Christian mystery believing that they could alter their perception over time. This was not very successful and meant that Catholicism in Africa was already ‘heretical’ before the crossing. It was necessary to keep silent about one’s African practices in the New World. It is clear that the saints’ sacraments and relics of Christianity were already in a synthesis with the Congolese worldview when they arrived in Brazil. This is an important point to remember, because this twisting of Christianity contributed to making the diabolic aura around the Congolese grow even stronger. There was a tendency to view the form of worship the Congolese Christians practiced to be in error, both in the form of worship and in the theological understanding. This often led to the assumption that the African faiths were diabolic cults. Hence words like kimbanda which actually means that from which the cure comes was perhaps seen as a means for curing, but equally considered as the devil’s remedy, and consequently evil.In the work edited by Phaf-Rheinberger and Pinto (2008) it is stated that the Angolan/Kimbundu term umbanda had the connotation of tra-ditional medicine or cure. The one who mastered this discipline was the Kimbanda. As we can see from the contemporary distinctions of Um-banda and Quimbanda, a massive amount of change occurred in order to re-establish these ideas as purely Brazilian concepts uprooted from Angola and readapted to the social and spiritual climate of Brazil.Kimbanda means healer/medium/medicine/cure and it can be a person or a tool for curing, like nkisi, a spirit vessel, bundles of herbs, or a talismanic object. Kimbanda is something or someone who holds the power of transformation. The healing nature of kimbanda is differ-"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"38ent from that of a sorcerer, but the power applied is similar. We should also notice that there is actually little difference in meaning when it comes to the word mbanda and kmbanda. As the phonetics suggest, the difference appears to be more one of geographical origin, between up-per and lower Angola. It can also be understood as being a prefix es-tablishing the art itself and the one performing the art. This means the kmbanda is a master of mbanda. When Umbanda took shape in Brazil so did Quimbanda, but the context was now wholly different as the fu-sion between the kimbanda and the sorcerer, Muloji was assumed to be one and the same.The arts of kimbanda were recognized to be about spirit traffick-ing and the facilitation of cures and healing, but also to effectuate at-tack and revenge. The kimbandeiro was a traveler in the other world and as such fulfilled a role similar to the shaman in native traditional societies where the shaman is the healer of the society and the time traveler along the ancestral line of the tribe. The earliest dictionaries of Kimbundu/Portuguese in explaining the term kimbanda states that this is similar in meaning to the Kikongo nganga and that the term ndoki is similar to muloji. Hence we see the sorcerous potency as a quality endowed in a person, and not as a practice. What is interesting in this is that the term muloji signifies someone who manipulates the power of fire and the spirits of ‘offence.’ It has a connotation clearly suitable for the more aggressive works of Quimbanda.Kimbandeiros, at least in certain districts, were considered ritual ex-perts and in particular with great knowledge of funeral rites. Frequent reports and known practices of the kimbandeiros were a skill in sum-moning graveyard spirits, both of good and bad intent. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the spirit known as Calunga Ngombe held a cen-tral position in the cabulas. Being the spirit of prophecy and divina-tion he was also used for diagnosis. Illness in Congo societies was not viewed only as corporal, but there were spiritual and ancestral compo-nents to illness as well, hence the Kimbanda would work with the dead and perform acts of sorcery in his or her healing work.Bastide presents an interesting theory as to how the syncretism and synthesis in the New World was possible. He segments Bantu and Con-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"39go faith into two vital components; ancestral reverence and reverence of nature. Of these cornerstones the colonisers broke one, that of an-cestry. Therefore ancestry became uncertainty, of crossing with other people, of abuse and rape. The whole ancestral pillar went through a radical transformation. In the same way the reverence of nature was redirected. The African nature spirits that served as access points to rays and realms within Nzambi were relocated. What was left was the most important element, the worldview of the Congolese that reori-ented itself in this new landscape which was partly known and partly alien. As one of Bastide’s informants told him when he was researching macumba in Rio de Janeiro: we live in a new land now, we need to pay rever-ence to the spirits of this land. It was this particular Congolese attitude that ensured the survival of their faith and influenced Catimbó, Candomblé and Quimbanda in Brazil.The Congolese reverence for nature and its spirit also extended to the native Indians of Brazil and led to a magical and powerful addi-tion to the cult of Caboclos, which in turn also marked Candomblé. With the arrival of more and more Yoruba and Fon people, Candomblé took a different shape and crafted itself on Yoruba principles though its roots were partly Bantu/Congo. Bastide claims that the Bantu/Congo perspective was one wherein spiritual opportunity was recognised and seized in the new religious movements of Brazil, for example Spiritism, where they saw the opportunity to take back their ancestors, but within a uniquely Brazilian expression. As Bastide wrote: It is precisely the readi-ness of the Bantu to take on the colour of his environment that explains why.In order to demonstrate the importance of the Congo influence and worldview we can look at the example of the Cabinda nation. In the 19th century theirs was a unique form of macumba which worshipped stones. The Cabindas gave reverence to the sunflower and their rituals were called macumba, apparently in the sense of going to a drumming. In the rituals of macumba they would call upon saints known as Ganga-Zumba, Canjira-Mungongo, Cubango, Sinhu-renga, Lingongo and others. In these rituals, chants, music and dance were a constant com-panion to aid possession by tutelary spirits and ancestors. The descrip-tion is similar to what the Bishop of Espírito Santo recorded at the end"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"40of the 19th century when he wrote about the Cabulas and their worship, which again is similar to what we find in Catimbó, another cult born from indigenous and Congo influences. Other deities they venerated were Nganga Nzambi (God), Zambiapungo (the spirit-ancestor of the Kongolese people), Lemba (a spirit of fertility), Calunga (spirit of the dead and the sea) and Zumbi (spirit of death). Interestingly for us, the priests were called Quimbanda. It is here we find the transposition of the Congolese Aluvaia and Bonbonjira as being identical with Èsú, al-though perceived from a distinctive Bantu perspective that is still alive and well in Quimbanda today.Bastide suggests a common origin between Bizango in Haiti and Quimbanda. Yet in Haiti Bizango is not solely Congo, but equally Ma-rabot, that is, of mixed ancestry. I believe he has noticed here something intensely vital and important about Congo spirituality, its ability to bridge similarities in an elegant and simple synthesis. He is also seeing the sympathy between the Congo spirituality and the native spiritual-ity that perhaps cross-fertilized each other as Quimbanda took shape."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Yet from those flames no light, but rather darkness visible.John Milton"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"iiiWardens at the Gates of Night From its history we can understand both why Quimbanda is subject to such great variations, and why it is so pragmatic. It is quite impossible to see one particular ritual or devotional format as more true or original than any other. From the accounts concerning the work of macumba we see basic themes repeating themselves. The focus of the rituals were to enter into possession with one’s Tatá or guiding spirit, what today is seen as one’s personal Exu. This relationship, this bond, is the heart of Quimbanda. It is this merging that gives birth to the Quimbandeiro and endows him or her with a unique set of powers. These powers are in resonance with the Exu itself and the lines and kingdoms close to the practitioner and the temple of Quimbanda he or she is born from.Holy Herbs & Enchanted Saints St. cyprian was an important saint in macumba given his ability to empower his adherents, especially in performing magical surgeries and animal transformations. Almost no one remembers this relationship in Brazil anymore, but the mystery lives on in certain brotherhoods called sect rouge in Hispania, as it does amongst some witchcraft families around the world. This capacity is in the secrets of spirits like Exu Mangueira, Exu Marabô, Exu dos Rios, Exu Meia Noite and Exu Capa Preta. Likewise, we find St. Anthony, St. George, St. John the Baptist, Sta. Catharina and others being given reverence in the cult. Yet contemporary Quimbanda does not necessarily pay attention to saints. We find a broad spectrum ranging from Quimbanda being maintained pure and without any (or minimal) outside influences, to small and isolated cults completely subdued by saints and orixas in some Umbanda terreiros. It is clear that the differences within the cult in existence today are the memory of the many lines which give a particular colour and form to any given cabula/terreiro.The native Indians also shaped Brazilian spirituality. Today this heritage is generally referred to as Caboclos and includes full blooded"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"43Indians and those of markedly Indian descent. Folklorist Câmara Cas-cudo suggests that the term is either from the Tupi caaboc, meaning for-est dweller or kariboca, meaning child of the white man. Caboclo was originally the name given to children born from the union of Indians and Caucasians, but over time became a denominator of Indian blood mixed with any other. The Caboclos originated in the North of Brazil from Amazonas to Alagoas, but over time spread across the entirety of Brazil. Bastide records that since 1591 the ways of the Caboclos were documented by the Inquisition tribunal under the name of santidade, or holiness/holy works.Santidade was said to have built its cult around a sacred stone they called Maria and initiation into the cult was a form of baptism. There were several Christian elements to the cult, such as the use of novenas, rosaries, and crosses. The Inquisition defined them as a ‘polygamous cult’ dominated by singing, dancing and the use of several sacred herbs in order to access the spirit of holiness. The cult worked with Caboc-los, encantados (enchanted ones/fairy taken) and eatiços (literally wind-walkers – in the sense of disincarnated Caboclos) and it was directed by Pajés (shaman-doctors). As Santidade faded away it took the shape of Catimbó. The typical altars of the Catimbozeiro would be two-fold, one to the right and one to the left, where statues, crosses, liquors, herbs and tobacco were present. It was also common to find amphibians and insects drenched in wax or resin present on the tables, being used as servitor spirits. They had, and still have, a separation of the week where some days were better for workings of ‘the left’ and other days suitable for workings of ‘the right.’ Monday, Wednesday and Friday were seen as auspicious for benevolent workings while Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday were good for malefic, hence the expression of giving smoke to the right or the left.The ritual followed the same steps whether one worked on the right or the left. With songs and prayers, whistles, incense and sweet per-fumes, dead Masters and Tatás, catiços and enchanted ones were called to take possession of the Pai/Tatá, guarded by the Master of ceremo-nies. Once in possession, the spirits frequently asked for tobacco and alcohol to sustain and support their temporary corporeal residence."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"44Besides tobacco, Câmara Cascudo noticed that since 1740 the use of the herbal substance ajua (perhaps ayahuasca) and jurema made part of the cult side by side with other psychotropic and powerful plants like djamba (cannabis). Djamba is said to be a Bantu addition to the cult, even though djamba is actually a Yoruba word.Of the spirits called upon we have mentioned encantados, or en-chanted ones, these are people who vanished mysteriously in nature without leaving any physical trace but continuing to influence this world from the other side. We might equate this to being fairy taken in Northern European legends. One interesting legend concerning the origin of the encantados tells us that after Jesus’ birth Mary went to Egypt to hide him under the roots of the Jurema tree in order to save him from Herod. This gave the tree supernatural qualities and it be-came the mother-tree of all encantados. This means that Jurema wine can work as a portal for people and turn them into encantados. Vital to this discourse is to note that the encantados were frequently seen as di-vided into seven kingdoms, although some traditions give five and oth-ers as many as 63. In these kingdoms we find states, cities and villages, each with their particular Masters. Each master has his own line of mysteries which he controls. The Masters could be native Indians, like Master Tupan (God of thunderous creation), Master Mussurana (God of healing) or be Caboclos, like Master Germano and Mistress Angel-ica. They could also be African, like Father Kongo, or Indian/African like Master Pai Joaquim, this generated a multitude of lines of shared ancestry. There is most certainly a legacy here that we find in Quim-banda, as in one of the pontos cantados of Pai Joaquim where we sing: Father Joaquim is black and jolly, as quimbamba.In Father Joaquim, Pai Kongo and so forth we find the class of spirits called Pretos Velhos. In them the wisdom of Africa resides and it is through this wisdom Quimbanda kept flowing and moving, guarded by the Bantu and Kongo heritage of the Cabula. Preto Velho represents the original image of a Quimbandeiro, a wise healer. The same influ-ences are also found in Catimbó which works with tables to the left and right and give smoke. Unlike Candomblé there is little choreography or folkloric dress code in Catimbó. Its main focus is upon the mediums"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"45and the lines of departed Masters, generating a fluid and pragmatic cult that inspired Zelio’s formation of Umbanda in the 1920s and, in turn, Quimbanda itself. Bastide concludes in The African Religions in Bra�il that:Catimbó devotees do not constitute solidly united organic entities. They drift from one cult centre to another, as variations in the ceremonies or the neighborhood facilities may dictate. Here reli-gious mobility is pushed to the extreme. The determining factors are individual preferences or need, daily life and its illnesses, love affairs, crops, unhappiness, and dreams of a better future.The Muslim Waters of Quimbanda The Muslim nations that arrived in Brazil, according to Nina Rodrigues and Arthur Ramos, guarded their mysteries whilst under great scrutiny. Their ability to guard secrets was so good that today their influence is hardly mentioned and only vaguely remembered. The Muslim persuasion was referred to as Mossourubi, Musulmi and Malê. Malê comes from Mali in the Niger valley which is dominated by the Malinka people (also called Mandinga) and rapidly became a synonym for macumba and black magic. Bastide points out that it was strictly speaking the Hausa people that brought Islam to Brazil, which is interesting given the Hausas’ geographical proximity to the Yorubas and the tensions between these two people. As happened when Christianity met Black culture, so too a fusion of African animism and Islam surfaced in Brazil, already in a transformed state and then going through yet another transformation in the new land. We know that in 1840 in Rio de Janeiro there was a mosque to be found at Rua Barão de São Felix. The Muslims were additionally at times called mina in reference to the port in Bahia where they arrived. It might also connect them to the early stages of macumba which most likely was established in the harsh conditions in the northern parts of the state Minas Gerais, where they were forced to mine for precious metals which were then"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"46transported to Victoria, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and at a later stage to São Paulo.As late as 1912 the existence of a Malê sect is reported in the state of Alagoas that venerated ‘Ali Baba,’ not the protagonist from The Thou-sand and One Nights, but Ali, the cousin of the prophet, the originator of Sufism and mystical Islam. The Ali they venerated was seen as a child draped in red, wearing necklaces of ofás and an alufa referred to as iman or almany who presided over the ceremonies which included making arabesque paintings while singing hymns of praise to Allah and orixás.Today these influences are rarely mentioned. It is as if the waters of Islam flowed completely into the spiritual climate of the time. This can be partly explained by the transformative quality Black Islam held, but also because the Hausa people were considered a great problem for the colonisers. From 1813 they started to ship many of these troublesome Hausa Muslims back to Africa, whilst eradicating many others. This led to the stronghold of Black Islam being fragmented, yet this allowed it to fully merge with the land and its spirits.There are some accounts of celebrations of Ramadan in small closed communities in Bahia and Rio in the late 19th century that describe the prayers and also the charms and practical magic performed. The impor-tance of kissium (prayer) and the Alcoran (Al Quran) is noted, as well as that they wear the abada and turban, and that they use prayer beads and observe fasts. Their public ceremonies were always performed in secluded places and they were reputed to be very private and secretive about their cult. The few accounts left speak of seeing supernatural light glowing upon the faces of the Malê and Alufás. Reports of mys-terious giants of fire walking in their company naturally gave them the reputation of being masters of black magic. Some saw benefit in this and started to sell spells utilising the aid of spirits known as aligenum, better known to us as djinn. It is plausible that some of this heritage found its way into the constantly developing Quimbanda, but it is hard to deduce exactly what came through the Muslim sorcerers.I find it reasonable to assume that this legacy is a memory encoded in the Malei line, and also in the Mossourubi (or Mossurubi). This assumption is fortified by some votaries of Malei Quimbanda being"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"47rather cautious with alcohol, tobacco and meat and even using prayer beads in works of contemplation and trance. It is also possible that at least some of the astrological lore that went through a theosophical reorientation by Lourenço Braga in the 1960s ultimately had a Malê or Alufa (Muslim) heritage. We can summarise this by returning to a quote from Pomba Gira and the Quimbanda of Mbùmba Nzila:There is yet another line, called Mossourubi, which is at root re-lated to the Malê, Muslims from the area of Mali and Sudan that were particularly represented in the state of Alagoas. These people were also called Malinka and Madinga, and this referred to those Africans who were neither Bantu nor Yorubá. The Yorubás were known by the generic Nagô. Malê is quite similar to Malei, yet an-other line of Quimbanda, reputed to be the most violent and sinis-ter of them all. The chief of this line is Exu Rei and his deputy Exu Marabo. Marabó is a term designating a sorcerer amongst Muslims in Sierra Leone and Ghana, equivalent to a juju man. Could it be that several of the lines found in Quimbanda today originate from this small group of Muslims from Yorubaland and Dahomey?"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"48The Lines of the Morningstar Rising from this melting pot of diverse influences, we find the Spiritist sect called The Followers of the Morning Star. This fel-lowship was heavily influenced by the French spiritist and occult movement and had at its core a doctrine that divided disembodied spir-its into the following categories:• Guides, who do not come down to earth, but ensure a certain celes-tial or planetary radiation which is accessible on earth.• Spirits of Light, who are the messengers of the Guides.• Marumbos, which are seen as disobedient and restless spirits that insist on staying earthbound.• Suffering spirits, who cause illness and inspire evil.From these four categories they saw five different irradiations or forces in nature that they parted into lines. These were:• The Line of Exu, where all vice amongst mankind was found.• The Line of Souls, where the suffering spirits were found.• The Line of Quimbanda, which was seen as composed of spirits tel-luric in essence, but having the nature of the Moon and Neptune. They saw these as the planetary forces inspiring sin and addiction. This line was nothing less than black magic of the worst kind.• The Line of Uruanda (Arruanda), which was composed of spirits that have turned away from their evil ways and towards the light, ie undergoing a process of conversion.• The Line of Umbanda that works only with spirits of nature which have become divinized and do the work of light.In this organisation we find the marumbos, a corruption of maroon or marabou, with the meaning of black ancestry. It is also likely that the word marumbu/marumbo and mironga (spell work) are related. Likewise, the line of Quimbanda, which was at this time considered the Afri-can line ruled by St. Cyprian, was as disobedient and restless as the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"50marumbos. The African heritage was acknowledged as a line in its own right, but was riddled with negative ideas and concepts. Clearly the idea of African cultures representing a primitive stage in human evolution motivated this hierarchy and the conversion of the Africans was now given a spiritual dimension. These tendencies were presented early on with a dilemma when the mediums working in the line of Umbanda also received the spirits of Pretos Velhos, Caboclos, Orixas, and even Exus.Given these factors another hierarchy took shape, but was rapidly transformed. This hierarchy attempted to organize the African spir-its into nations, such as Nagô, Cassange, Angola, Malê and so forth. These attempts at organizing the spirits were in turn redefined through the work of N.A. Molina, Antonio Alves and Aluizio Fontenelle which developed into the lines of classical Quimbanda still worked today. Be-neath this lies a forked root of magical Christianity where Joseph of Arimathea was considered the mystical origin of Umbanda whilst the heritage of Nicodemus prefigured the mysteries of Quimbanda.In this process Exu takes on the role of Satan and Lucifer, under-stood to be the murky subconscious of God himself. He is the cosmic quicksilver that threatens the natural order. Because of this the spirits in the line of Quimbanda were seen as cosmic fluids of a sinister dispo-sition that could be converted to the light by being treated as the slaves of Orixás and Angels. Exu is described as a part of our animal soul, an instinct aiming towards survival, protection, defense and attack, what the Umbandistas came to call pagan. So, here is the divide, in the words of Fontenelle:Quimbanda perpetuates the determination to maintain the old African traditions, while Umbanda seeks to break away from the wild and uncivilized influence of Quimbanda.Lacking a kinder word, it seems to me that a form of spiritual racism is moving the spiritual climate. But it is also worth noting that the Afri-can roots were so far spread into so many conclaves of spiritual life that it was impossible to remove them."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"51It should be clear by now that the idea of lines arrived from several dif-ferent origins, such as the cult of encantados, Santidade and Catimbó as well as Spiritism. The Followers of the Morning Star are but one example. This too is found in Kardec’s spiritist theology, where one of the pillars is that spirits generate phalanxes based upon common affini-ties. In the same way as we humans form groups and relationships based upon intellect, shared interests or vibrations, so it is on the other side.Already in 1925 Leal de Souza had generated a proto-line where macumba and Spiritism merged with Candomblé influences as they were presenting the first lines of Umbanda.• The Line of Oxalá (Nosso Senhor do Bomfim)• The Line of Ogum (Saint George)• The Line of Euxoca (Oxossi) (Saint Sebastian)• The Line of Xangô (Saint Jerome)• The Line of Nhan-San (Iyansan) (Saint Barbara)• The Line of Yemanjá (Our Lady of Conception)• The Line of Almas (Souls, the African Line of Saint Cyprian)What is salient here is that the Yoruba spirits, the Orixás, are given an elevated position while the Bantu and Congo heritage are bundled together into one line, the line of souls which was in practice the line of Quimbanda.In the following decade the lines changed, and so did their content. We find the Line of Oxalá turning completely Catholic and not only venerating the legions of Saints like Anthony, Rita, Catherine and Expeditus, but also departed Africans who during their life were good Catholics. The Line of Yemanjá turns into a line of multiple legions wherein we find sirens, undines, Caboclos of waters, and mythological creatures like the Boto and the spirit Jara. The lines also hold a particu-lar affinity with Mary Magdalena, Venus, the Moon and Polaris. The Line of Iyansan is substituted with the Line of the Orient seen as being commanded by Joseph of Arimathea, and here we find nearly every kind of people from Eskimos to Europeans, Japanese to Arabians. The Line of Oxossi and Xangô were filled with Indian spirits and Caboclos"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"52while the Ogums were considered guardians of lines like Malei, Nagô and given places in nature. Lastly the Line of Souls, defined as the African line, lost its saint and was seen as ruled by Father Cabinda, in reference to the slaveport in the Congo delta. Here, in Cabinda, we find legions of Angola, Guine, Congo, Mozambique and so forth, all with their Masters and Fathers.In this climate Quimbanda takes shape, as in a glass darkly it shows its resistance, with wings, claws and African blood it rises within seven lines, which were detailed in the mid 1930s as being as follows:• The Line of Souls ruled by Omolu and his legions of cemetery ghosts and ghouls.• The Line of Skeletons of the Cemetery ruled by João Caveira (John Skull) and his legion of hungry ghosts.• The Nagô Line ruled by Gererê and spirits haunting crossroads.• The Mossorubi Line (Muslim) ruled by Exu Kaminaloá and his legions of crossroad demons.• The Malei Line ruled by Exu Rei and Marabô with their legions of vicious and dangerous spirits of aristocratic and decadent leanings.• The Line of Caboclos Quimbandeiros ruled by Pantera Negra (Black Panther) and his legions of savage spirits, both African and Indian.• The Mixed Line ruled by Exu das Campinas (Exu of the Plains) and his myriad of hostile spirits.Seven is a recurring theme and a number with great significance. There is good reason to assume that the seven lines and seven kingdoms were partly influenced by the Book of Revelation where we find the seven churches that are given seven messages and each possess seven weak-nesses and strengths. As the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse desig-nated specific types of congregations or communities, so did the seven original lines. and from this the hierarchies.The Seven Infernal Kingdoms are divided into seven night hours, each holding a particular vibration where given works are said to be more effective. In the middle ages the night hours were divided into"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"53the following decans or parts and similar observations can be noted in some houses of Quimbanda even today:CrepusculumVesperumConticiniumIntempestivaGalliciniumMatutinumDiluculumOnly Intempestiva, the dead of night, the blackest hour is considered auspicious for the night flight, whereas the twilight hours are seen as mixed hours that can be used for a multitude of workings. The two hours marking the twilight of the Sun’s rest would be benevolent hours and conticinium being the hour of contemplation and fortifying the focus of the work taking place at the Intempestiva, the inopportune hour. This gives us the hour of cock’s crow, Gallicinium, where light returns to the world over the next two hours, which are excellent for purifica-tions and sending to rest what is restless. Gallicinium is given the col-our black, Matutinum, red and Diluculum, white.The Seven Lines of Quimbanda The legions of exu are organised into specific lines. These are the hierarchies that will be presented shortly, but there are also hierarchies within the hierarchies. Each and every Exu is a chief in its own line of mystery with its attendant spirits. This is also true for each and every house of Exu and Tatá. For instance, in a house where Tatá Exu Morcego is sole chief, a unique hierarchy, albeit with common denominators, will establish itself. Likewise, if a particular set of mysteries is worked, let us say roots and healing, one would organize the Exus at least into a kingdom or even a line of healing spirits where Exu Curadôr, Exu das Matas and Exu Pimenta would be high up, given"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"54their expertise in these matters. This means that whatever Exu is the head of a given temple is the King of that place. Your personal Exu is the King in your life and as such is in charge, being at the top of the hierarchy for you. The hierarchies change according to which Exu is the most prominent in the various temples and terreiros. We might see the terreiros as distinct districts in the realm of Quimbanda, each with its own chief. These spirits are organized in many different ways: just as spiritual and social organisations can vary in form, so do they. Furthermore, one should be aware that the hierarchy is not carved in stone. It is a dynamic organisation, and just as military officers change rank over time, indeed so can Exu. This is accomplished by the constant addition of new Exus to the legions, which induces a healthy dynamic into the organisation of the various legions. Thus, the system turns into a dynamic relationship with Exu and Pomba Gira, which is based upon personal congress with these spirits. The simple secret is that every Exu and Pomba Gira is a king and queen in his or her own realm. The organisation into hierarchies is actually far less important than the personal relationship the votary forms with Exu. Knowledge of the original hierarchy may come in handy when work with a given Exu is failing. One can approach an Exu higher up in the hierarchy than the Exu worked in order to reinstate harmony. For instance, if a problem is experienced in a work with Exu Carangola, it is possible to rectify matters by appealing to Exu Caveira or Exu Tranca Ruas as they are senior in the hierarchy.Another element is that each Exu and Pomba Gira is seen by Um-bandistas as having roads themselves. This means that there is an Exu Caveira of the Souls, just as there is an Exu Caveira of the Crossroad and so on. This manifold segmentation exists in order to give added quality and direction to the power worked with. For example, the pow-er of Exu Caveira in his natural habitat, the Cemetery, will be different to finding this force at the shores of the ocean.Another organisation of the spirits of Quimbanda is in terms of kingdoms. The kingdoms are as follows: Encruzilhadas (Crossroads), Cruzeiro (a reference to the large votary Cross in the middle of the cemetery), Matas (Fields/Weeds), Calunga (Cemetery), Almas (Souls),"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"55Liras (Harp) and Praia (Beach). This classification will be used in the spirit catalogue given in this book. The kingdoms also present the Exus and Pomba Giras in their original station, as guardian spirits of specific portals in nature and places of power. In the kingdoms we meet original powers, whilst in the lines we meet teaching spirits. It is useful to have a good grasp of the kingdoms, because no work is done unless licence is granted from the kingdom we work with. Exus from other lines and kingdoms can then enter as parts of the spirit host when a particular work is done, depending on what kind of work is done in the kingdom. Just like an army distributes its soldiers and commanders depending on the type of expedition being undertaken, so it is with the spirit host established in kingdoms, workings and in life. These positions will not necessarily be the same as their rank in the hierarchy but are mediated by the temperament of the Tatá and the terreiro.It is finally worth observing that the lines replicate the mystical number nine as the seven Exus have a king and a queen that begins and ends the lines. This nine-fold division is found again in the organisa-tion of Exus placed in kingdoms.Here follows the traditional seven lines of Quimbanda:First LineThe Line of Malei, headed by Exu ReiThis line is said to be related to the practices of Catimbó and has lately gained a reputation of being a school of black magic, a sort of dark side of Quimbanda. The colour of this line is black, red, dark green and gold. This reputation can however be disputed, as the line consists of some of the most wise and benign powers of all the legions, but it is also because of the aristocratic and wise quality of these Exus that makes work with kiumbas (i.e. husks, larvæ) perhaps more safe in this line than any other. These spirits are associated with reptilian spirits of the night, and also with the beast-like forms some men become after their death. Some people do not turn into pure souls upon death, but rather become creatures of nightmare. This line is said to consist of the spirits of sorcerers and witches. Personally I find reasons to see this line"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"56as one inspired by the proto African lines and the heritage of the Malê (Muslim) people. Because of this I am not in agreement with Exu Rei being the ruler, but rather Exu Marabô the Elder. Some say that these spirits make the high council amongst the Exu and they are organised as follows:1 • Exu Rei das Sete Encruzilhadas2 • Exu Marabô3 • Exu Mangueira4 • Exu Tranca Ruas das Almas5 • Exu Tiriri 6 • Exu Veludo7 • Exu dos Rios or CampinasPomba Gira • Pomba Gira Rainha das Sete EncruzilhadasSecond LineThe Line of Souls, headed by OmoluThis line works with the transition of souls between the planes; as such, all of these Exus are at times understood to be omolus, spirits of the Cemetery. The colours of this line are red, black and white. The work in this line is of a healing nature and we find much Yoruba influence here. For instance, the padé is frequently used, as is the food known as amalá and various forms of white ebós. These Exus are excellent teach-ers of the art of mediumship. It is a fine balance in the line between stable benevolent forces and more eruptive benevolent forces. This line can be worked when we seek to understand the mysteries of death in all its facets. They are organised in the following way:1 • Exu Mirim2 • Exu Pimenta3 • Exu das Sete Montanhas4 • Exu Ganga5 • Exu Kaminaloá"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"576 • Exu Malê7 • Exu QuirombôPomba Gira • Pomba Gira das AlmasThird LineThe Line of the Cemetery, headed by Exu CaveiraThese spirits live in the cemetery and take the form of skulls and skel-etons. Their colours are red and black with hints of yellow. This line is marked by the undead, revenants, vampires, and night creatures of all kinds. In the line of the cemetery we find death in a most active form. These spirits can be evil, sexual and dangerous, but they are also some of the most effective spirits to work with in solving impossible situa-tions or unblocking roads. When this line is worked it is important to observe regular regimes of purification and magical baths as kiumbas frequently come on hard when this line is worked. These spirits are organised as follows:1 • Exu Tatá Caveira2 • Exu Brasa3 • Exu Pemba4 • Exu do Lodo5 • Exu Carangola6 • Exu Arranca Toco7 • Exu PagãoPomba Gira • Pomba Gira Rainha dos CemitériosFourth LineThe Line of Nagô, headed by Exu GererêThis line is reputed to be one of the more advanced of the lines, be-ing from the area of Nagô on the border of Benin and Nigeria. The colours of this line are black and red. These Exus control the magical"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"58arts, astral travel and are well versed in the art of Vodou. Exu Gererê is often confused with Exu Ganga, but is in fact a slight corruption of Gégé, designating the work with Vodouns in Candomblé. The spirits in this line are said to be Gangas, in the sense of being sorcerers or magical medicine. They preserve a form of Vodou of Nagô origin and at the same time are a more ‘pure’ expression of Yoruba faith. The Nagô line is reputed to be very hard, demanding and dangerous in its crude Kongo sorcery. 1 • Exu Quebra Galho2 • Exu Sete Cruzes3 • Exu Gira Mundo4 • Exu do Cemitério5 • Exu Capa Preta6 • Exu Curadôr7 • Exu GangaPomba Gira • Pomba Gira Maria PadilhaFifth LineThe Line of Mossorubi, headed by Exu KaminaloáThis line consists of spirits who have the power to influence the minds of people, to cause diseases and inspire insanity. Its colours are red, black and dark blue. Those working with this line tend to develop ex-cellent skills as dreamers and diviners. It is a line of Arabic influence where we find both the warrior and the sheikh. It is also said that this line tends to bring in Asian influences to the life of the one who works it, such as Buddhism and Bön-p0. Pomba Gira Rosa Caveira has an af-finity with this line. Whenever you need to attack another person’s mind to cause insanity and delusion, cancer or diseases of the blood, these spirits know the ways. Here I believe the hierarchy is slightly off, or perhaps it has simply changed over time. I would personally move Exu Morcego to be first in command, followed by Sete Portas, then Sete Sombras and then Dos Ventos. The spirits of this line are as follows:"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"591 • Exu dos Ventos2 • Exu Morcego3 • Exu Sete Portas4 • Exu Tranca Tudo5 • Exu Marabá6 • Exu Sete Sombras7 • Exu CalungaPomba Gira • Pomba Gira Maria MulamboSixth LineThe Line of Caboclos Quimbandeiros, headed by Exu Pantera NegraThis line consists of Indians and Quimbandeiros who are experts in the art of healing, cursing and shape shifting. The knowledge of the wild lies here as well as the legacy of the Caboclos and their sorcery. Their colours are black, red, green and white. These spirits often take the role of personal guides for the people they choose to walk with. Most stories relate that these spirits were more concerned with inflicting pain and harm on people when they walked the earth, but in their disembodied state they have turned into helpers and healers, yet they retain a poi-sonous sting. Most of these Exus are found in the woodland and they always take the shape of Indians. They are as follows:1 • Exu Sete Cachoeiras2 • Exu Tronqueira3 • Exu Sete Poeiras4 • Exu das Matas5 • Exu das Sete Pedras6 • Exu do Cheiro7 • Exu Pedra NegraPomba Gira • Pomba Gira da Figueira and/or Cigana"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"60Seventh LineThe Mixed Line, headed by Exu dos Rios or Exu das CampinasThis line does not consist only of Exus in the strict sense of the word, but also a great variety of malefic spirits and entities of crude compo-sition that can be used in works of attack and malefica. These spirits can also become guides and teachers for the Quimbadeiro, but many of these Exus have a reputation of being unreliable, as they feed upon destruction, obsession and havoc. It is not possible to list the names of spirits of this line as they seek out the Quimbandeiro along personal paths. It is however interesting to note that this line is the redefined Af-rican line from the 1920s, here considered a collective of myriad spirits. It seems that the constant spirits in this line are Zé Pelintra and Pretos Velhos Quimbandeiros.Lines of Umbanda related to QuimbandaFor the sake of completing this presentation it is worth seeing the re-lationship Quimbanda has with Umbanda in terms of lines. This or-ganisation considers Quimbanda as a slave line of Umbanda and hence Orixás are considered to be the true chiefs of Quimbanda.• The Line of Oxalá is related to the line of Malei.• The Line of Ogum is related to the line of the Cemetery.• The Line of Oxóssi is related to the line of Caboclos Quimbandeiros.• The Line of Xangô is related to the line of Mossorubi.• The Line of Yorimá is related to the line of Souls.• The Line of Yemanjá is related to the line of Nagô.• The Line of Ibêji is related to the mixed line."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"61In addition to this, Ogum serves a distinct and important function as the guardian of ritual procedures, and his manifestations in terms of lines are as follows:Ogum Malê • The Line of Malei.Ogum Megê • The Line of the Cemetery.Ogum Rompe Mato • The Line of Caboclos Quimbandeiros.Ogum Matinata (and/or Rompe Mato) • The Line of Mossorubi.Ogum Megê • The Line of the Souls.Ogum de Nagô • The Line of Nagô.Ogum Xoroquê • The Mixed Line (Linha Mista).There are also other Ogum spirits, more tied to the lines, such as Ogum Beira Mar who is seen as guardian of the line of Yemanjá and the ocean shore and Ogum Yara who is a protector of rivers, waterfalls and female Caboclos and women in male-oriented occupations, like hunting, the police and military.When a given Exu is taken as a focal point the hierarchies tend to change accordingly and are then moved by the given Exu possessing a radiation that calls upon a unique hierarchy. For instance, if we take Exu Meia Noite as a focal point for a working we would also have access to Exus like Mirim, Pimenta, Malê, Ganga, Kaminaloá, Carangola and Quirombô.

He induces hysteria and madness of various kinds. Some say that he is the spirit that in-spired the whirling dances amongst the dervishes; this is because he enters possession with a similar swirling movement. He is also knowl-edgeable about the domains of Exu Caveira and is said to have been a Rabbi, or at least well versed in the mysteries of Kabala. He is one of the more obscure Exus and is best approached under the auspices of Exu Caveira, as he has a reputation of being difficult to control.

This, along with tamarind, eucalyptus, banana leaves and alfavaca (Ocimum basilicum), though a fusion of cloves and basil can be used as a substitute. He also likes garlic, so a fumigation or bath for him can be made with garlic, guiné, eucalyptus and alfavaca. He likes lead and tin for metals, and in the mineral kingdom he likes onyx and hematite. The latter is a stone he at times uses for healing purposes.

This verse demonstrates how attached Exu is to Pomba Gira, Woman of Seven Husbands, and it also states the powers of the Queen of Quimbanda. If she shakes, Exu will fall. Pomba Gira represents the totality of female possi-bility. Her rays penetrate through solemn whispers in the boneyard and the burning lust of vampires. She is as much the stern Queen in control as riddled with debauchery.Libertine Spirits of Truth Over the years Quimbanda has gained a reputation for being one of the most welcoming of all African-rooted traditions in the diaspora. It is a cult free from judgment of people in all their diversity. This has also led to some unbalanced focus on the sexual element and we can today find examples of people stating that, for instance, Pomba Gira has a preference for homosexuals, prostitutes, transgenders and transsexuals. But this is not so. In truth, they don’t care about colour, social status or sexual orientation, they care about heart and honesty – that painful truth many have difficulties admitting to themselves.She is a spiritual force that encourages honesty of self, and Exu sup-ports her ways and makes them stable. It is almost as if we see a reversal of the traditional symbolism here where the male is the pole and the woman is the possibility, what we see taking shape here is about the mystery of the pole itself. The pole is encouraged to be erect by the pounding heart, blood and soul of woman.The openness in Quimbanda is not only due to the social conditions amongst Kimbundu speaking nations but also a consequence of the cul-tural diversity in Brazil that managed to uphold a form of adoration for women, albeit in the shadows of the machismo so typical in Latin countries. Macumba, later identified also with Quimbanda, gives us a"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"69myriad of stories of men protecting women, going to death for women and women having multiple lovers. No matter how you wish to look at it, the essential nature of many Exus is that they, as the fallen host, adore women. Hence they call upon the demonic as they recognise woman as heart and soul, purpose and meaning. I dare say that even the vilest of Exus will tell in the end the story of woman being the bed where his anchor caught.Deep within Quimbanda we find a celebration of heart, soul and woman. So there should not be any mystery as to why anyone feeling the eyes of a judgmental society upon them will feel at home in the wild court of Quimbanda. In this untamed court she is Dominatrix and Solace, the soul pure and free of judgment. With her blood-dripping whip she tempers men and woman to be free and true in their pursuit of setting their ecstatic fate on fire.The fact that Quimbanda does not discriminate between genders and sexual preferences goes back to its African roots, where amongst most Kimbundu speaking people sexual preferences were not seen as problematic. In other West African districts, especially in the southern parts, the tendency was to see homosexuality as an attack upon nature, a form of grave disrespect towards the earth and the conceived natural order. In some districts death was the punishment for this. It should also be added that in Brazil the development of Quimbanda was taken care of by Kimbundus who were quite open in their approach to life, and fused with the equally carefree native inhabitants in Brazil and exiled people from Europe. So, the open-mindedness of the particu-lar African strain and the liminial situation of exiled Europeans fused with the natural and joyous ways of the native Indians made prejudice difficult to establish.Pomba Gira has embraced the voluptuous, the sexually dangerous and libertine. In doing this she becomes the sensual and erotic dagger that cuts both ways. This doesn’t mean that she is a spirit that encour-ages us to cultivate vices, rather she forces us into situations where di-rect confrontation with vices and the sensual world of the soul gives us opportunities for gaining a deeper understanding about ourselves and our world. By assuming this form she brings a testimony to the world"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"70about the value and worth of being true to yourself and your choices in the labyrinth of fate. There is nothing right or wrong in her world, there is simply acceptance and denial. Her whip drives you away from social acceptance to self acceptance.Since she is a liminial spiritual reality thwarting the extremes of ex-perience and life, certainly a female prostitute – or any sex worker for that matter – would benefit from developing a relationship with Pomba Gira because she represents all facets of womanhood and guards wom-an in all situations. Likewise, Exu is prone to guard honourable males, in whatever situation, as long as heart and truth is present.Over the last 30 years or so a tendency has surfaced where Quim-banda is used to effectuate our desires. It has become about binding objects of desire and pulling down the tower so it can fall upon the heads of our personal enemies. Prior to this, Exu was placated to lift sorrows, to make the crooked straight, to give money and not poverty. As the world changes, so do our demands. Naturally they can do all these works for you, but all invasions into natural currents come with a cost and a consequence. When we make a Quimbanda working for, let us say, the binding an object of desire, we need to observe what drives us. In this, we should understand that in the premise of the work we automatically summon a blessing or a lesson. The clearer we are about this, the less crooked our road to desire will be.In a cosmological myth from Uganda, Charlotte and Wolf Leslau re-tell how Kabezya Mpungu, equivalent to the Bantu and Kongo idea of God, Nzambi Mpungu, had four children: Sun, Moon, Darkness and Rain. He then created the first man and woman and decided to with-draw from his work. Prior to this he called his four first creations to-gether and asked what they would do in his absence. They all revealed that they would abuse their power and allow their quality to reign for-ever. Kabezya Mpungu made them agree to take their allotted part and placed Mutimba, ‘heart’ in his place. Mutimba felt lost in the world and declared: Oh how great is my desire, said Heart, to commune with him. But since I cannot find him I will enter into Man, and through him I will seek God from generation to generation."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"71It is curious, and quite beautiful, to see that the heart, the throne of the soul, is placed amidst powers that each had a tendency to overflow and thus generate disequilibrium whereas the Mutimba has a direction upwards, to the source.The Gardens of Hell Aquimbandeiro is a healer, hence the realm of medicine and plants should make part of the corpus of their knowledge. The herbarium of Exu is one of cures and poisons, of calmatives and psychotropics that ease or agitate mind and passion. The herbs and sticks, trees and scents favored by Exu are fiery and Saturnine, Solar, Jovial and Mercurial. We find plants announcing death, as in poisons and trees like yew and manioca brava (Manhihot esculenta). We find hellebore, mandrake and the melons of São Caetano (Momordica charantia), side by side with Crown of Christ (Euphorbia milii), mint, macadamia and laurel. I have decided to give a herbarium of Exu based on the particular property of the plant as it resonates in quality with Exu, hence herbs and plants, leaves and trees from all corners of the world will be given here along with their uses and qualities as applied within Quimbanda. In Quimbanda Exus take on the form of bats, crows, and undefined hybrids: part animal, vegetable or mineral like Exu do Lodo, who animates the muddy beaches and Exu Brasa who comes to life within embers. There seems to be a wholly different metamorphosis present amongst the Exus and hence their garden is also different from the flora we find in Pomba Gira’s adytum. So with this be welcome to the garden, where Exu walks the night.Aconite, Wolfsbane or Monkshood (Aconitum napellus) is not na-tive to Brazil but its lycanthropic gifts make it an interesting plant that prefers to grow amidst the rocky soil in the gardens of Hell, likewise Digitalis which carries similar properties as the bane of the wolf. It is said to have been born from the saliva of Kerberos in his confrontation with Herakles."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"72Ash (Fraxinus ornus) is the tree said to have wounded Achilles. It is also said that it sprang from the blood of the castrated Ouranos. This tree can be used in works of stability and protection and to ward off hostile energies.Alecrim/Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a plant that brings strength of soul and mind and is particularly sacred to the kingdom of Calunga and the ocean shore. Its use in works of love is well attested to in its reputation as a plant ally of Streghes in Italy. The plant also holds the capacity of what we might call grace and is as such a wonderful herb to use to sanctify spaces. The plant is frequently used as a component in sacred baths to clean temple and home and it can also be used in works of attraction as it ignites the fires of love and passion. For cleaning the tronco of Quimbanda or to get rid of negativity in one’s home 2/3 rose-mary can be used together with 1/3 raw tobacco macerated in 3 dl of vodka and added to water.Alfazema/Lavender (Lavandula sp.) is used to attract the line of Souls and is a powerful expeller of negativity. It has natural disinfect-ant qualities, brings the mind to rest and provokes dreams. It can be used as a fumigation or an infusion.Aroeira/Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus) is indispensable when seating Exu. Its resin is said to be the concentrated fire of Exu, but its pow-dered bark can also be used, as it has similar qualities to the resin. It has the ability of seating what is restless, and naturally it can also be agitated. It holds great protective qualities and jars of charged bark and resin can be placed at the gate of the house to ward off negativity.Abacate/Avocado Tree (Persea americana) is not often used di-rectly in the cult, but its medicinal qualities are vast. An infusion of the leaves will fortify the immune defence system and invigorate the whole body. The fruits can be used in cases of impotence and lust un-der the aegis of Exus like Sete Sombras, Pedra Preta and Sete Cobras. The working should be done at the foot of the tree."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"73Banana counts a vast kingdom in its own right and carries calmative properties and blessings of long life. Snakes and vipers love this plant, as do many varieties of insects. It is possible to work with Exu Serra Negra at the foot of the banana tree in aggressive spells. These aim to cut a life short and involve knives, oils, sulfur, gunpowder and works done with the plant’s leaf and the name of the target.Basil/Alfavaca (Ocimum kilimandscharicum and similar) is a basil of African origin, also known as Black Opal. The types of basil most favoured in works of Quimbanda are those which possess a distinct aroma of camphor, citrus or clove combined with the basil flavour. These varieties of basil hold magical qualities superior to the common basil and have a great transformative potency. They can be used as a general herb for all types of work, be they for defence, attraction or attack. It is particularly sacred to the line of Malei, Nagô and Mos-sorubi. There is a great variety of uses for this herb and one classical method is to make a bundle of seven fresh sticks which is then wrapped in red and black cord and presented to Exu. The bundle rests with Exu overnight flanked by three candles, and the following night the name of the person one wants to influence is placed within the bundle. The names must be written crossed seven times preferably on the bark of an appropriate tree and placed inside the bundle as pontos are sung. The bundle is then left in a bowl of vinegar, salt, pepper and guiné (Petiv-eria alliaceae) to generate turbulence, or in honey, rosemary, cloves and roses to bring about attraction. Exu must be given a seven-day candle and cachaça and red wine and the working is left for three days and then disposed of in the proper kingdom.Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is a little-used ally, but is slowly making its way to the Cult through barley wine and beer offered on rare occa-sions to Exu Mor and Exus in the lines of Malei and das Matas.Beans (Vicia faba) are the necromantic gateway par excellence, es-pecially black beans. They can be used as a means for warding off one’s land by throwing them at the front and back door of one’s house, and/"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"74or at the gate. It is known from several Books of Cyprian and grammars of the Black Arts that beans planted in the sockets of skulls produce plants with unique powers. Black beans are especially used in Quim-banda as part of food offerings to all Exus; they are however most prized by Omolu and his spirit hosts.Boldo (Plectranthus barbatus) also known as Tapete de Oxalá (Carpet of Oxalá) is a great purifier of spirit, mind and the intestines. This plant can be used as a calmative infusion and it heals the liver and brings respite from nausea.Calamus (Acorus calamus) once used to make the pipes of Pan, it holds qualities sympathetic to the line of Mussorubi and is adored by Exu Veludo in particular. It can be used in workings where one seeks to influence the mind and thoughts of others and is also worked well in the Malei line and in the kingdom of the Calunga.Cardo Santo (Argamone mexicana) is an herb sacred to the line of Malei, said to hold the power of tangling people up in confusion and fear. It is also used in the treatment of malaria and is mildly toxic. It is a cousin of Tribulus terrestris. Exus like Morcego and Asa Negra have a great affinity with this plant and can be used to generate mental turbulence.Carqueja (Baccharis trimeira) is a great plant, bitter to the taste, but holds cures for hepatitis and diabetes. It greatly fortifies manly vigor. It is adored by all Exus, perhaps because of its phallic shape and equally masculine qualities. It is an excellent herb to use as an infusion in its own right, or soaked in cognac or cachaça to fortify the spirit of the Quimbandeiro.Cipó Caboclo is both a reference to the vines of the Davilla family as well as the Jagube/Cipo mariri (Banisteriopsis caapi), which is an integral plant for the creation of ayahuasca together with Chacrona/Rainha (Psychotria viridis).

It is a powerful plant, a fusion of Saturn and Venus and can be used in works of domination and seduction. Exus like Sete Liras, dos Infernos and Zé Pelintra hold a particular affinity with this plant.Cravo de Defunto (Tagetes minuta) belongs to the kingdom of the Calunga and das Almas with its cacapacity for guiding departed souls, but it also quickens land bound spirits. It can be planted in order to make a border between the living and the dead and as such serves as a field of communion.Cypress (Cupressus semprevirens) is a tree revered as the staff of Ascle-pius and is sacred to Apollo. It shares necromantic qualities of domin-ion like the Laurel, but also carries the additional property of serving as a compass for the departed. Its sappy texture is excellent for works involving the restoration of, and communion with, the dead.Crista de Galo/Cockscomb (Heliotropum indicum) taken as an in-fusion is good for antiseptic purposes. Exu Quebra Galho and Exu Sete Portas are drawn to this plant and it is said that the plant is good for elevating a sunken soul, i.e. as a remedy for melancholia.Dormideira/Sensitiva (Mimosa pudica) is a vicious plant of mildly toxic qualities. It is in itself a cure for insomnia, but magically it is used by thieves to pass unnoticed and also in workings where there is a need for rendering someone blind to some shady business or clandes-tine activity. You can work this plant under the auspices of Exu Gira"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"76Mundo where the flowers of the plant are used as a focus for targeting those one seeks to ‘sedate.’ It is also possible to use this plant to quicken dormant emotions, here the flowers are worked with honey, apple and sweet red wine with the help of Exu Porteira, Exu Veludo and Exu do Cabaré.Elderberry/Sabugueiro (Sambucus sp.) is a tree considered to be wise – but also punitive. It is held by the kings and queens, and also Exu Quebra Galho who marks the boundaries. The branches of this tree can be cut at twilight and made into a bundle in the image of a whip and used to torment people. Its fruits can be used as a part of a padé to sweeten people, even for making them amorous.Elm (Ulmus glabra) is a dreaming tree and is a ladder the inhabitants of Hades climb in order to commune with us. It is also said to be the tree that guards the garden of Hesperides and can be used as a general ally in the kingdom of das Matas.Erva de Santa Maria (Chenopodium ambrosioides) is a herb favored by Exu das Almas and in general in the kingdom of Encruzilhadas. It is rich in iron and holds curing abilities for soft and mucal membranes like the eyes. It is said to be a plant that can aid in the elevation of bones and hence, necromantic and mediumistic workings.Eucalyptus/Eucalipto (Eucalyptus) is a potent disinfectant, but also holds the powers of earth and is as such a beneficient plant ally for any works done in the realm of Quimbanda. It is a wood that catches fire easily and its oil eases tense and fiery muscles. It is particularly adored by Exu do Cheiro, Exu Kaminaloá and Exu Sete Encruzilhadas.Fedegosa/Sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia) is an herb cherished in the kingdom of the Cruzeiro.

It can be used in the kingdom of the Encruzilhadas.Fig (Ficus caprice) is the gift from Hell to the Quimbandeiro. In the same way as it represented Persephone in Antiquity it represents the Queenship of Pomba Gira. It is a plant sacred to the Maioral, to Exu Calunga and Exu dos Infernos.Folha de Fogo/Fire Leaves (Climedia hirta) is another indispensa-ble plant for the manufacturing of the assentamentos of Exu and Pom-ba Gira. This is the vegetable fire that gives life to Exu.Ginger/Gengibre (Zingiber officinale) is a root loved by all Exus and Pomba Giras. It is the root of fire and can be used as an infusion with alcohol to make a much adored fluid for their fire to walk on. The root is also used for making images of those one seeks to influence and the doll, with its volts, are sunk in containers of bitter or sweet fluids, prayed and sung upon with candles and tobacco for seven days in a row.Garra de Pomba Gira/Claws of Pomba Gira (Martynia annua) is used to bring stability to the fire of Exu and Pomba Gira, and it is indispensable to seating her. It can also be used to stabilize erratic ener-gies in the form of offerings of cachaça or earth containing these seeds.Grape (Vitis vinifera) is revered for its properties of being a con-duit of the spirits that ensure manifestation for Exu and Pomba Gira.

It is a plant much adored by Exu Morcego and is mostly used in works of direct harm and active protec-tion.Henbane (Hyoscyamus níger) is clearly the herb of St. Cyprian. Though a herb that does not grow naturally in Brazil, its bitter lycan-thropic qualities lead me to introduce henbane to my own tronco and I saw a myriad of winged Exus delving into my gift, which means Exu Morcego and Exu Asa Negra as well as Exu das Cobras do find an affin-ity with this plant which can be used for good and ill, but most of all for shape shifting.Heliotrope (Heliotropium sp.) carries the dominant powers of the Sun and can be used as a general agent for sweetening situations and dominating negativity. It is particularly revered in the kingdoms of Calunga and das Praias.Hellebore (Heleborus sp.) plants are prized by Exus like Morcego, Kaminaloa and many others given their capacity for inducing madness and frenzy. It is a key to night and the incomprehensible fire at the heart of the Fig.Hemlock (Conium maculatum) was the herb Socrates drank and on its wings he went to the other side.

It is a com-mon sacrament in Quimbanda and in particular for those working with Caboclos, spirits of the land and Exu Pantera Negra. As with ayahuasca we have here a sacramental gift adored by all lines and in all kingdoms, because the spirit known as Jurema is the third arm of Pomba Gira da Figueira do Inferno.Laurel (Laurus nobilis) is endowed with the gifts of the Sun and makes the necromancer victorious in his or her arts. The plant belongs to the Maioral and Exu Rei and is revered in the kingdom of Encruz-ilhadas.Lemongrass/Cidreira (Cymbopogon sp.) is also known as fever grass because of its ability to ease fever and the condition that caused it. It can also be used to make an ointment for full body application when one is preparing workings, especially of attack and defense.Life Everlasting (Helichrysum siculum) serves several purposes with its power of imbuing bones with the lifegiving powers of the Sun. It can be used in the delicate process of reanimating skulls and bones for the purpose of communion.Malva (Malva sylvestris) is a plant adored by Exu Veludo and the inhabitants in the kingdom of das Matas.

The plant is used in workings of death and el-evation of death, but also to repel hostile spiritual influences.Manioca Brava (yellow manioc) and Manioca (common manioc) are the twain roots of a plant of immense importance. Mani was the name of a Tupi warrior who sacrificed himself for the welfare of his tribe which was suffering hunger and drought. The young warrior was buried and from his corpse grew the plant called Manioc and as the plant sprouted the great Tupan brought rain and lightning to the earth. Manioc means the house of Mani, hence the manioc root became a first fruit of the land. This fruit was divided into white and yellow, the white being blessing of life, and the yellow being the blessing of death. The manioc is the food of the Gods, it is considered the food of the Golden Age and its twin quality being a symbol of the Tree of Wisdom that brought death and time to the world. We see its importance today in the making of padé, the prime food offering in Quimbanda, which is either made with manioc flour or corn flour. Both plants hold similar majesty replicated in their amazing endurance in hard conditions.Mamona/Castor (Ricinus communis) hás a shared affinity with Omo-lu and Exu Rei. It is a plant that manifests the serenity of death and fire. Accordingly its leaves can be used for serving offerings and as the field of workings itself as much as a component for the assentamentos of Exu. The plant is slightly toxic but contains wonderful properties and can, like Orange peel, be used as fuel, denoting its powerful fiery qualities.Mandrake (Mandragora sp.) is not native to Brazil, but yet its po-tency must be noted. I personally brought this root to the feet of Exu and have found it to be revered as an equal by Exu Mor. It has entered"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"81into a curious symbiosis with the yellow manioc, which would indicate a mutual recognized ancestry.Mangueira/Mango Tree (Mangifera sp.) is the sacred tree of Quimbanda par excellence as its fruits are seen as gifts from the Sun itself; hence the tree represents dominion over death and the dead. It has a status similar to the laurel. Initiations in Quimbanda must involve the Mango tree, it is considered to hold a potency almost ancestral in importance and must be a part of any well-made assentamento. Exu Mangueira is a great stabilizing force that calls upon the entire field of wood dwelling Exus for good and for bad.Mint (Mentha sp.) has always carried connotations of Hades and the Netherworld, being the tongues of Hell spreading its rhizomes under-ground. Interestingly many mints are rich in estrogen and it is a plant unhealthy for the male fire if used in excess, with its relative penny-royal being an abortifacient.Mulberry/Amoreira (Morus nigra) tells the story of the Babylonian lovers Pyramos and Thisbe who met secretly at a Mulberry tree. An un-fortunate incident with a lion caused Pyramos to be killed by his own sword and Thisbe, seeing her dead lover, followed suit. Their blood was drunk by the tree whose berries turned dark red. It is considered a devilish tree of wisdom and can be used in works of defence as well as attraction. It causes fatalities to occur. The tree is sacred to Exu Mor, Exu Morcego and Exu Meia Noite.Myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) is a spiny resinous shrub that gave birth to Adonis and is used in works of reddening bones and tools to quicken the dead. The herb is sacred to the lines of Cemetery and Souls.Oak (Quercus ilex) is the most important tree for Dryads, amongst many people and cults it is considered to be the King of Greenwood. It is the tree which the golden fleece was hung upon and guarded by the Dragon. It speaks of ancestry and death, being the ancestor of priests."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"82Obi/Cola Nut (Cola acuminata) is used for divination – and so is onion – which in Quimbanda is considered equal in fire.

The Obis symbolise stability and prophecy – it is a seed all spirits respect – and so it is with onion.Olhos de Exu/Eyes of Exu (Abrus precatorius) give characteristic seeds looking like red eyes with a black pupil. The whole plant carries intense properties and is said to carry the totality of Exu’s transforma-tive quality and is therefore used to manifest this force.Olive (Olea europea) is most sought after in the cult for its oil, which can be used as a conductor for making sacred oils. It can be used as a substitute for palm oil and is to be preferred when working with the Malei line.Parsley (Apium sp.) was the sacred herb the Goes used to wash bod-ies with. It is also turned into amaci (sacred water) to repel ghosts and larvaes (kiumbas). A bed made from pine and parsley can effectively be turned into a deathbed which calls upon the aid of Exu Sete Cruzes.Pine (Pinus sp.) is a majestic and wise death tree, sacred to all the kingdoms, but in particular Calunga, because this tree is the life sap of death and murder. It is a tree that holds the souls of those who suffer violent deaths.Pomegranate (Punica granatum) is the fruit with which Hades se-duced Persephone. Ovid also tells that when the unworthy use the seeds they will be turned into screech owls.

Sage can be used in offerings or as a fumigation. Magical baths made with sage, salt and lavender will expel any hostile negativity around you.Succulent/Cactus is a wonderful plant used in works of protec-tion or to affix a victim on poisonous thorns. The more poisonous the cactus is the better suited it seems to be and the working of the cactus is simple. You anoint the plant at the foot of Exu as your wishes are placed upon the thorns of the plant.Walnut (Juglans regia) shares properties with Chestnut (Castanea vesca) and is a tree adored in the line of the Cemetery. It holds the power to command spirits of all sorts and serves well as a conduit for communion, and also to stabilize erratic workings and situations. It is a tree sacred to Exu Mor and Exu Capa Preta.Wormwood/Losna (Absinthum sp.) is the superior plant in the line of Malei, and in particular of Exu Marabô.

Initiation in Quimbanda is to accept that suffering, turmoil and transformation are equally important parts in our progress as human beings as any form of spiritual or material blessing. I believe this lies at the root of Kongo spirituality, and is a fundamental understanding necessary for any healer. A healer must comprehend the suffering he or she aids people to rise above, and in this he or she must know Hell intimately and have discovered solutions and solace to aid in their ascent. It is in this deep metaphysical truth we find the idea in Umbanda that the Exus and Pomba Giras need to be evolved, to be turned to seek the light. Simply put, the world of matter is Hell. The view from the stars is that we are living in Hell, but we look beneath our feet and find soil and bones, the memory and knowledge of ancestry and sages kept alive on earth, living on in trees, flowers and poisons. Quimbanda is about realizing this truth and it gives you the allies you need for coping with this in a way that brings fulfilment. The path is a hero’s journey through the field of stars. It is because of this element, so rarely spoken of, that I see Quimbadeiros falling prey to the impulses of the lower self, which calls upon us to be at one with the forgetfulness of earth and rivers. We call these forces kiumbas, they are obsessive spirits that can do our bidding ... or we can be their prey. We have nine of them, aligned to the kingdoms – which is good, because then you can realise the constitution of the negative influence. Realising the nature of the problem leads to its origin and from this we find solutions taking shape.I have witnessed a handful of different forms of initiation in Quim-banda, some elaborate and others head on and direct. I find both to be equally valid as long as they enable connection with spirit, because this is the entire goal in initiation in Quimbanda, that you meet your Exu and/or Pomba Gira and are consumed by them in a lifelong merging.

When your foot is in the dirt and embers you are there to stay.A proper initiation in Quimbanda must always challenge your fire, to temper it. This is effectively done with amaci, magical baths, and the nocturnal rites. It is a play upon the purity of spirit and flesh while the soul is caught in purgatory. It is a purging that has to be accomplished, and it must be done with a play upon Moon and Sun. Whether short and intense or long and brooding, a true initiation will accomplish this goal; with the Sun and Moon on your shoulders you will at some point be burning within, because your Exu is there with his coals and em-bers, to make two One. So what is the gain? What is the purpose? Why would anyone deliberately place their foot in the fire and walk on? The answer is simple: dominion. Dominion is to take control, it’s not about the hunger for power at large, it is about dominating what is yours, be it soul, flesh, star and even Fate herself. Fulfulling this promise is no small accomplishment and this is why so many walk away from the path direct.The Quimbandeiro is a healer to the greatest extent of what this word can mean. In this are shared sympathies with what we generally call shamanism. The Quimbandeiro searches out remedies for healing a society of one or a thousand. Still, we have the taint of black magic all over this, because indeed at root Quimbanda is black as Africa, the womb of the world where wisdom rests and has been continued. It was through Africans and the indigenous nations in Brazil it was continued, and underwent a social reform in the early 20th century where the dia-bolical imagery became a point of focus.The proposition is this: why not have dominion of your world – not the world – because this is not what is offered to you. Again people perceive wrongly. The dominion is really about your world, to take what is yours, truly yours, and in this work for your desires to become manifest. But this does not entail delusions of global supremacy; it is a question of being in control of your world first and foremost, not the world of others.

This is Quimbanda.The Earth in Flames In quimbanda places of power are often referred to as kingdoms. In every kingdom we find a great herd of protectors, guardians and supporters of a specific power, often attributed to a specific line. The line is always a composite of legions dancing around a focal point, a potency of particular importance within the line that calls upon obeisance from other powers. The lines reflect the multicultural ancestry of Quimbanda and in the past it was common to initiate people in conformity with the line they were working within. For instance, the line of Mossorubi, which is the line of Muslim influence, would diverge to some degree from how one was inducted into the line of Caboclos Quimbandeiros, native spirits and Nagó, Yoruba spirits. One would then work with the spirits in the particular line one was admitted to, but crossovers often happened as in the kingdoms all lines ultimately meet. In essence initiation followed the same main points, but the context varied in conformity with the line. Unfortunately much of this lore is lost. It is but a memory that asks the pragmatic workers of contemporary Quimbanda to yet again establish ways of lineages. One example might be the Malei line that over the last 30 years or so has gone through a significant ‘Africanisation’ in its modus operandi and forms of initiation.It is more common today that each house has its own format, a vari-ation upon the basic secrets that make up unique initiations. I have witnessed initiations spanning a week and initiations spanning a night, they can each be effective as long as the centre of the secret is revealed, as blood and fire mingle, as a truthful connection is made with Exu."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"89When this connection is made with your Exu, initiation is conferred and a unique hierarchy takes shape. The lines and legions of Quim-banda re-establish themselves in conformity with the temperament of the newborn Tatá and also in resonance with the personal Exu of the Quimbandeiros and how this Exu is connected to lines and kingdoms.This means that we operate with two different hierarchies, one of a more general order, as given in this book, but in the private affairs of the cult the hierarchy is different. What is typical is that the role of the maioral will be filled by Exu Lucifer, Exu Mor or Exu Rei das Sete Encruzilhadas and the Exu of the Tatá will be the Exu Rei under the direction of the maioral in question. The personal Exu of the Tatá will be the King of the particular house, and the personal Pomba Gira its Queen. From this lines and kingdom tend to mingle until a given line stands out and can then be seen as the line of the house. As this hap-pens the secrets of the house reveal themselves to the Tatá and fortify the tronco.The kingdoms are nine and the spirit catalogue in the last chap-ter presents the Exus in conformity with kingdoms. A kingdom is a realm of power with a multitude of singular powers. A kingdom is not confined to graves and natural locations. In Quimbanda we also value manmade urbane constructs as holding particular powers, especially places that are passionate and hot. Every hot and turbulent place, where transformation is the keyword, is inhabited by an Exu or Pomba Gira. But we should be careful in assigning transformation just to seductive love play and bar fights. The rush of inspiration coming from reading a philosophical text that ignites new perspectives can also be a product of the transformative quality of Exu, as can sudden creative sparks that came from seemingly nowhere.We should be mindful that occupations can call upon the presence of potencies in given kingdoms. For instance a gardener will be attached to the kingdom of the Wilderness (das Matas), but his Exu might be Marabó, hence his line is, strictly speaking, Malei, and from this a unique constellation surfaces. A prostitute will work in the kingdom of the Harp (Lira) even if his or her Pomba Gira might be Calunga, hence a crossover between the Cemetery and the Harp is established. I"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"90have found the observations of these nuances to be immensely valuable and useful in realizing both our presence in the world and who we are. Exu is a flame guarding places of power all over the earth and the inbetween. This is also true for the practitioners themselves, set aflame in the transformative fires of Exu in a perpetual state of becoming.The Frenzy of Possession Possession defines a condition where we are taken over by spirit resulting in an altered state of consciousness, and where we are allowing the higher and the Other to take us over. A genuine possession is commonly said to be signified by being completely taken over by spirit and the medium having no recollection of what was said or done during the event.There are however other forms of possession; one is termed two headed possession in which the spirit goes in and out of the medium. It is considered an unstable and unreliable form of possession due to its lack of consistency, and in this it may be as difficult for the medium to be truthful as it is for the spirit. It is often a confusing matter and it is better to train the medium to be able to hold the spirit either in a complete possession, or what in Quimbanda is referred to as being in vibration. Being in vibration means that something is hanging onto you. This form of possession is very tangible. The medium will feel a weight attached to the nape of the neck and the area of the kidneys and liver. Something is literally hanging on your back. This form of possession can be understood to be a form of agreement between the medium and the spirit where the medium is aware of what is going on, but has decided to allow tongue and body to be at the disposal of the spirit. The medium remains as an inner observer, yet even in this state the medium’s recollection tends to be foggy and blackouts tend to occur. In my experience this form of possession is a real state, but difficult to maintain as the tendency to succumb totally is present at every second.Possession has a negative connotation in the West as it implies a push-ing out of our venerated, and often overrated, rational consciousness."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"91We are constantly reminded that possession is something evil and harmful. The ideas around exorcism do not help either. But in truth, possession is a merging with nature, celestial or infernal, where spirits and ancestors can use the living flesh as a conduit for prophecy, to do workings, to give counsel or to celebrate life and love.If we look at the Greek understanding of the terms exorcism, ex-orkizein, and demon, daimon, we see that an exorcism was once under-stood to be a binding of a spirit by oath and a daimon was seen as a spirit/soul somewhere between man and the celestial, in the sub-lunar sphere. I speculate that the sub-lunar dwelling of the daimons is per-haps what has caused psychology, since Iohannes Weyer, to see it as a form of mental illness. Likewise, modern psychology is gradually get-ting more interested in this phenomenon given the increasing popular-ity of African-rooted traditions and their adoption by Westerners.From a professional and practical point of view I note the similari-ties, but also the differences between possession and mental illness. For instance, the pathological symptom of hearing voices is usually a trait of some schizoid disorder. This can also occur in a spiritual practice, but for the one suffering from a schizoid disorder there is difficulty in sepa-rating the dimensions as imagination, fantasy and reality are constantly fused with little or no discrimination. For the practitioner working with possession and trance state this is not the case. Of course, posses-sion by hostile spirits can happen. In Quimbanda we call them kiumbas and the Romans called them larvae and this bears further discussion.First we must consider benevolent spirit possession and turn to Wey-er’s teacher, Henry Cornelius Agrippa, because possession was clearly commonplace in Western magic, as it is still amongst the few genuine traditions of witchcraft alive today. I am aware this might come as a sur-prise to many, hence my citing of Agrippa, because the many nuances he discusses are present in possession work in Quimbanda.Agrippa discusses the nature of possession under what he terms fren-zy. He defines the cause of frenzy as superior souls falling on our souls and making use of the body and tongue of the person whom the soul has fallen upon. The fact that he sees this as a soul merging is, I believe, of great importance."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"92In the past prophecy and soothsaying were part of this complex of states, with the Pythoness at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi being perhaps the most well known example. Agrippa makes a distinction between being taken over by a demon and by being moved by the Holy Spirit, he seems to make a distinction here in terms of the quality of the pre-dictions of the oracle, where predictions of the future are supposedly from the Holy Spirit and other forms of inspirations are from demons/daimons. His attitude is born from the theological dilemma of his time concerning celestial and demonic magic where seeing the future was reserved only for God. This questioned the worth and lawfulness of prophecies made by daimons. Soothsayers and those who cast lots were especially targeted because their practices were seen as an invasion into God’s sole domain. But this is only one of the effects of frenzy. Agrippa continues, saying that there are three ways for demons souls or spirits, holy and unholy, to make use of this ‘vacancy’ when the alien soul en-ters our body and soul. They are frenzy, ecstasy and dreams.It would be good to pause here and look more closely at the idea of the soul. It is common to envision the soul as singular, but this model does not fit with the West African idea of the soul. Kongo faith holds that our soul is a complex of souls, a gathering of quickened powers that have a nature similar to lightning. The idea of the soul is perceived as a cluster made up of a harmony composed of various extensions of Nzambi giving us thoughts, memory, emotional states and otherworldly capabilities. In this, there are natural powers, connections with plants, minerals and animals that generate a unique soul that goes through a transformation from its pure flame at birth until its destination in death. Upon death, parts of the soul return to nature and Nzambi and yet other parts can merge with the ancestors, or even become walking deities. Death does change the constitution of the soul. A parallel to this can be found in the Scandinavian concept hugr, which is commonly translated as soul. The hugr is a composite of thoughts and spirit that can be contemplative and passionate. It is constantly followed by the double, fylgja, which comes in a variety of shapes and guises from all realms in nature and also from the invisible realm. Again we speak of a composite; the soul is an aerial fire, a bundle of active nature that lies"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"93at the heart of who we really are. Because of fylgja, it is possible for the hugr to go out hamferd, literally skin leaping, and the soul can then change shape as it rides the night.The perception of frenzy being caused by spirits, gods and demons coming down is also found in the writings of Ovid. Plato also spoke of frenzy and possession. In Phaedrus he defines this state as a freedom of the mind where the body is loosened, as if it is escaping a prison, and in this state of freedom transcendence is experienced. We are provoked by a divine spirit that makes us transcend the physical boundaries. This can be done by dreaming, by ecstasy, by the use of herbs and the variety of spirit possessions and inspirations.The frenzy is born from four different celestials, or potencies; these are the Muses, Dionysus, Apollo and Venus and each of them inspires in the medium a particular form of possession. Agrippa says of the frenzy of the Muses that it tempers the mind and brings the superior to the inferior, and that it is associated with lily, moonstone, soothsaying and divination. Verbena is a plant that facilitates this form of posses-sion. We can say that this form of possession is similar to the idea of ‘inspirations’ we find in Palo Kimbisa and Palo Cruzado. The Muses are the nine children of Mnenosyne (Memory) and are themselves consid-ered aloof ancient spiritual potencies. This form of possession is best utilized for generating art, scrying and divination. It can be a deceptive form of possession and demands that the medium is well trained and capable of discernment to avoid mixing the planes. Dreams pertain to this form of possession.The second frenzy Agrippa discusses is mercurial and issues from Dionysus. It is largely attributed to shapeshifting and astral travel. It is similar to the shifting of hamr we find in Nordic practices and the idea of using the power of Oso in Yoruba cultures to travel the night. In Angola, this is the most noted attribute of the Muloji, the sorcerer; to be able to go forth at night in ghastly forms and cause havoc. This form of possession is also used in Quimbanda, but only after midnight, and the soul must be brought back to the body before the cock’s crow. The body of the Tatá is anointed and washed in sacred herbs, veiled in a white shroud and either the Exu of the Tatá is called upon the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"94shrouded body – or Exu Morcego and Exu Asa Negra, as well as the entire retinue of the line of Malei can be called upon – to undertake the night flight.Agrippa writes that the technology for Dionysian possession rests in the use of solemnities, conjurations and expiations. He also adds that this form of possession enables us to hear our daimon, like Socrates did, or even see our daimons and spirit guards. This state can also cause involuntary possessions, where the spirit enters for moments into va-cant vessels to deliver a message or a prophecy. This has several degrees ranging from a blackout on the part of the vessel, to hearing the voice of the daimon and being the mouth that brings forth a message. This is quite typical to see in young mediums who experience spirits slipping in and out in the process of attaining balance in exercising the mediu-mistic gift. It is also here we find the two headed possession we spoke of previously.Agrippa deems the frenzy of Venus to be more subtle and makes the possessed one like God, because of the power of Love. In Asclepius we see this form of possession described as follows:Man is a great miracle, an animal to be honoured and adored; for he passeth into the nature of God, whereby he becomes God; he knows the rise of demons, and he knows himself to have his origi-nal with them, despising the part of his human nature in him-self, having a sure confidence of the divinity of the other; the soul therefore being converted, and made like to God.This sublimation is brought on by being possessed by the Holy Spirit itself, the possession of Love. This form of possession ignites proph-ecy and miracles. When this possession takes place the atmosphere will change, either the temperature, or at least goosebumps and electric shivers in the bones will be experienced by all those gathered. This is what we understand as a full possession, but it is of a subtle and aerial kind. At times the spirit dawns upon the medium so smoothly that nothing more than a gust of wind is felt, as the spirit lodges itself within the medium in seconds."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"95The frenzy of Apollo inspires voices, words, singing, music and har-mony. Agrippa says that the method is to give sacrifices, food offer-ings, adorations and invocations. This will cause the mind to rise until the placated virtue is encountered and this will then inhabit the vacant body. He also speaks of how one can be possessed by image, that gazing on a certain spirit-endowed image can ignite the spirit within to con-nect with the spirit of the image. It is the frenzy of prophecy proper. It is a frenzy that divinises or evolves the vessel even after leaving, and the golden residues of the visitor are left with the host, so to speak, and the medium grows in accurate perception. This state is what we call a full possession, but is denoted by the spirit being far more active in words and actions than when imbued with the rays of Venus. We find the use of wine and herbs as conduits of this form of possession and commun-ion with the spirits of nature, in particular water, as well as vigils in caves and the consumption of sacred food.To these four basic forms of possession Agrippa applies degrees that give an added nuance to the frenzy. He says that the degree of Mars has positive effects on the imagination and is as such a trigger for creativity. The degree of Jupiter induces the gift for consultations and counsel. The degrees of Saturn were related to contemplation and the ability to absorb wisdom, images and riddles. Agrippa also commented that there is a speculative trickiness here that can be self-deceptive. Finally he comments that the degrees of the stars and of the primum mobile would indicate a more direct connection, close to manifesting a god, spirit or demon in the flesh. There are two ways of looking at his com-ments about the degrees. One is that we can recognise the starry influ-ences from the behaviour of the medium. The other is that he suggests the possibility of utilising astrological elections for one’s possession work. In my opinion this can only positively enhance the connection with spirit."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"96Sick Shells, Hungry Husks & Seething Souls Quimbanda’s view of the soul and afterlife has similarities with Roman cults and Kardec spiritism, but it all rests firmly on a Kongolese worldview. This means, that as there are good and bad people, so there are good and bad spirits. Not all souls are inter-ested in our welfare and some are downright deadly. We might say that the idea of Tatá as disincarnated priests and masters is similar to the idea of the Roman lares, household spirits and guardian spirits. I find this reference very illuminating for how the idea of Tatá is understood in Quimbanda. The lares were spirits of land, blood, spiritual affinity etc. In many ways we can say that the gathering of lares to a specific per-son, household or temple is identical to how the constitution of the soul was understood. The unique gathering of lares would protect, guard and inspire the person they assembled around and the household and temple they were set to guard. Amongst the lares we also find penates, ancestors and familiar spirits, although these are a distinct class within the spirits that guard the hearth.Finally there is the concept of larvæ or cascarão (empty shell, husk), which are also called kiumbas. This class of spirit is dread and darkness, formless and restless in their vengeful and liminal state. As I related earlier in this discourse, Quimbanda was originally seen as the dark mirror of Umbanda populated with resentful spiritual forces that need-ed to evolve by doing good work in the service of the spirits of light. The larvæ-like spirits of Quimbanda are known as kiumbas, derived from a ki-kongo word meaning skull or works of the skull – designating a vacant space for welcoming any type of spirit. But in Quimbanda, kiumbas designate a particular class of spiritual malefica and fire. Hence we find the idea of some force, both good and ill, becoming tangible and workable. The kiumbas are understood as being similar in function to the ghosts of people murdered, in agony, suicides and any other form that can lead to the spirit becoming restless and negative. They are also those spirits released from people unenlightened whilst on earth and hence they pass on in a darkened state and have little or no direction, only a quality of anger and despair about them. These spiritual reali-"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"97ties can be used for workings and sent on errands, but they are never particularly loyal and are more like a beast on a leash, so care must be taken and support from one’s guides must be in place when such brute powers are manipulated. In Brazil a common belief is that from Ash Wednesday, after Carnival and until the night when the Passion ends, these forces are particularly active and many refrain from doing work-ings during this period as negative intrusions may occur. The kiumbas are presences which naturally gravitate towards places of power guard-ed by Exu. We might see them as representing legions of negative and mindless vibrations resonating with Exu. The kiumbas are said to be particularly active in the night hours between roughly 2 am and 5 am.Each class of kiumbas has a particular force assigned to a kingdom. The work with kiumbas should not be done by inexperienced prac-titioners and I deem it crucial to first have one’s Exus seated (i.e. you must be initiated). The kiumbas have a particular clinging quality to them and rapidly infest the practitioner as he or she is turned into food for these hostile spirits. The qualities of the kiumbas as they are found in the kingdoms are roughly as follows:• Kiumbas of the Calunga are said to be powers consumed by hatred and violence. Here we find powers that provoke enslavement and domination.• Kiumbas of das Praias are revealed in debauchery and provoke per-versity and hot-headed sexual sadism.• Kiumbas of the Encruzilhada are said to be consumed with agony and wrath, are in a constant state of being purged, and are prone to share this pain and cause confusion, despair and violent accidents.• Kiumbas of das Almas are recognised by inspiring the feeling of be-ing a victim in people and cause people to engage in self-destructive behaviours, if not outright degradation and violence.• Kiumbas of the Cruzeiro are said to be consumed by disease and pes-tilence and can even cause damage to the immune defence of the practitioner as well as inspiring risk taking behaviour.• Kiumbas of the Lira boil with violence and vengeance and can inspire violent tendencies and addictions of all forms in the practitioner."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"98• Kiumbas of das Matas are greedy and gluttonous spirits that can pro-voke the practitioner to fall away from their centre and be turned into a slave for these hungry husks.Whenever work is done in these realms it is wise to observe the time when they are particularly active. It is also important to take note that when these kingdoms are worked the quality of the working will draw the attention of a myriad of spirits, even kiumbas. It follows that it is crucial to monitor oneself after works are concluded and be honest with yourself. Be aware of any negative or odd changes in your state of mind or heart, as these powers can attach themselves with great ease to the practitioner and contaminate their life and home. Observe ritual dili-gence in dispelling them, either by the use of amaci (magical baths) or offerings. Strategies for expelling these influences are similar to what we find in European lore in the remedies given for expelling vampires and ill-intentioned ghosts. Offerings of thorny roses, coins and beans, or throwing flax and sea salt over one’s left shoulder three times as one leaves the kingdom is a good ritual strategy to apply, especially when more harmful or fiery workings have been performed.The Loathsome Kiumbas The seven or nine kiumbas can be viewed as a response or variation of the seven deadly sins. In order to understand the substance and work of the kiumbas we need to understand the metaphysics beneath the seven deadly sins. The name kiumba was understood by the kimbundu speaking people to be something filled with ndoki, in this case skulls or bones radiating a given energy, seen as powerful and at times negative. Ndoki is yet again a quite neutral word signifying power, presence and such like, but the kind of presence a kiumba was said to hold in itself was of a darker kind, and hence the usage of the term in modern Quimbanda as something malevolent."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"99The kiumbas can also be seen as powers related to the primordial nine or seven sins, each one finding a subtle or direct relationship to the circles in Dante’s Inferno. Let us look at these kiumbas through the looking glass of Quimbanda, because these cosmic powers carry the potentiality of destroying grace, and this is as equally true for the work done with kiumbas as for the one using them.Limbo is the realm where the unbaptised are found. Anima Sola, the lone spirit in flames tied to the embers with chains is the proper image of this. Limbo has seven gates that lead to virtue or vice. It has been equated with purgatory, with the fairy realm, the abysmal waters and Hades; all these interpretations hold truth. In the works of Dante we find most Greek philosophers here, but also Ovid, Orpheus, Julius Caesar and Dante’s guide Virgil himself. Limbo is a place where man is given a chance to temper his weaknesses. Wantonness, to be indecisive and weak, was in Antiquity considered to be the stepping-stone to mis-fortune and ambiguity. Limbo represented a chance to take control of one’s passions and desires.Beyond the first circle, all of those condemned for active, deliber-ately-willed sin were judged by the serpentine Minos. The structure of the circles, especially the lower ones, is in accord with the classical (Aristotelian) ideas of virtue and vice. When going through some of the well-known sins it is easy to see how they replicate the nature of the kiumbas in the kingdoms.Luxuria (Lust) was in Dante’s Inferno a place where restless torna-dos and strong winds impaired the desire for quenching the appetites, especially those of sex and lust. To be overcome by sensualism is the sin here, and Dante sees Cleopatra and Helen of Troy, Lancelot and Guinevere and also Tristan and Paris. It induces a state of frustration and despair. We find this current being born in works of bindings and where passions and lust are magically provoked.Gula (Gluttony) is the realm where we find the three-headed dog Kerberos who represents self-indulgence and megalomania. This influ-"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"100ence is noticed when a person seeks to dominate for the sake of domi-nation, to block other people’s roads because he feels in the right and thus justified in destroying other people’s good fortune. There is a form of envy taking place here that heaps misfortune upon misfortune.Avaritia (Greed) was seen by Dante as the result of ignoring the celestial in favor of the pursuit of temporal power. Robbery, treason and disloyalty are natural consequences of this quality and naturally we find priests, popes and nuns in this circle of Inferno; those who have used what is holy to become thieves and secure material wealth. This is unfortunately a common occurrence amongst many who work with spirituality as their main source of income; hence they call upon kium-bas to interfere in their happiness.Socordia (Sloth) is a failure to utilize one’s gifts, talents and fate; put simply, laziness. It is a sad condition where the kiumbas of disbelief have entered a person’s life and generate carelessness and fits of despair.Acedia (Melancholia) is denoted by an uneasiness of mind, self-ha-tred, lack of care over one’s appearance and suicidal tendencies. These are kiumbas we find in the Calunga and at the Cruzeiro.Ira (Wrath) is marked by vengeance as love of justice perverted to re-venge and spite, in the words of Dante. Here we find hatred, anger and self-destructive behavior as the most prominent qualities with kium-bas. In Inferno we find these people in the joyless river Styx where they are in constant battle with one another, futile battles that never end. The influences of these kiumbas are noted by the same effect: war-mongers, dispute and battles of ego – unfortunately another common feature amongst practitioners that work fiery cults and faiths.Invidia (Envy) is a desire to deprive other men of their good for-tune. In Dante’s Inferno their eyes are sewn-up with wires. We find here the kiumbas inspiring the potency of the evil eye, a dislike for people more fortunate than ourselves and a failure to acknowledge the good works of others."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"101Superbia (Pride) – or Hubris in Greek – is a boastful love of self, perverted into hatred for others. It is similar to Vanagloria (vainglory/vanity), which denotes a boastful attitude and narcissism. This is well known as the sin of Lucifer which caused the fall. Actually Superbia is a quality that causes one to misunderstand one’s station and purpose, and the fall in question is one where the kiumbas provoke the person to ‘fall away from him or herself’ and become a stranger in their own domain hiding behind masks (larvæ) of grandeur and ill-will directed towards others, especially if they are recognized as worthy or superior. All of these sins are measured against virtues, and central for the play upon vice and virtue is the idea of arête. Arête designates the road of virtue to reach excellence, to be the best that one is capable of being. A part of this work rests in dominating one’s passions and negative incli-nations and not being mastered by them. The hallmark of a true Tatá, someone who has mastered the cult of Quimbanda, is found in this form of excellence of character. This will be the token that the serpents of fire have been tamed, the kiumbas chained, and that they adhere to the Tatá as the viceroy of the Maioral."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven ...

When your personal Exu or Pomba Gira has become clear it is perfectly fine to work with them, but if guidance is absent, the votary should limit the work to the spirits that are naturally close to him or her. We all have these spirits around us, and our personal spirits tend to enter into agreement, working with us in harmonious ways; but we cannot say the same of other representatives of this large family of spirits. Some of them are tricky and others very unruly. It is important to keep in mind that the work a votary does is restricted and that the focus for one’s work will be a particular Exu or Pomba Gira. Yet still here danger abides, because we are working with parts of our soul that are easily led astray in delusion, passions and vice, without being necessarily provoked by kiumbas.No matter how we seek to understand Quimbanda, at the centre we find the eternal demand of character and knowing yourself. This is true for the one who works Quimbanda as an infernal communion, as much as for the sorcerous warrior. A successful working depends on character and discipline. When we know ourselves we are able to generate still-ness and all that we need to apprehend becomes comprehensible to us. We will know what needs to be done in a given situation and will use cunning in how to approach the spirits and the working itself.From any kind of working we make, whether good or ill, residues remain. We make a mark on the world, no matter how small, by work-ing a given bond. It can be like ripples on the water or a cat scratch on a diamond. Good workings tend to generate residues that bring more abundance, whilst negative workings generate residues of darkened light which attracts the blind and obsessive powers that naturally get involved in malefica. It is important to have enough discipline to in-vest time in cleaning up these residues so they don’t infect your body or soul. Quimbanda, being a cult of nocturnal fire, will when worked naturally stimulate the same fires in the practitioner."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"104The Magical Arsenal of Quimbanda The magical arsenal of Quimbanda consists of cleaning spells, bindings, attack of all sorts, sympathetic magic, prayers, petitions and workings called despacho/ebo, or offerings of various forms. This arsenal is typical of any sorcerer who offers up a lament and demands in a dance with gifts and sacrifice. We feed the spirits with alcohol, tobacco, herbs and flowers to force a given road to manifest for our workings. This can be given on their point, the written signatures called pontos riscados, and fed with prayers and songs, called pontos cantados, or they are done in their realms in the world or at their tronco and temple. The wise Quimbandeiro who possesses a true and genuine connection with his spirits can perform marvellous acts with a cigar, a few candles and a bottle of cachaça, and the misguided one will slaughter a farm just to twist creation a scant degree to his will and then have dark clouds falling on his shoulders as a negative pattern of repeating misfortune becomes established.I adhere to the idea of the Quimbandeiro being a warrior, a spiritual and sorcerous warrior, but with this understanding demands present themselves. In order to use one’s arsenal wisely, one also needs to un-derstand the purpose of the work being done and in this the circuits and bonds of energy applied, as well as the function of the tools used. In Sun Tzu’s Art of War the first chapter deals with this calculation, which I deem crucial for the sorcerous warrior. Sun Tzu writes:It is a principle of the art of war that one should simply lay down his life and strike. If one’s opponent also does the same, it is an even match. Defeating one’s opponent is then a matter of faith and destiny.The quote goes deeper than what is written, because the true enemy is always the enemy within. No war in the world of magic can be done successfully if the enemy within is not defeated. When we defeat the enemy within, serenity of mind arises. This serenity enables us to use the passions as tools of the mind. The question is then: how to reach"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"105this state of mind? A cold and calculated use of the fire that accepts with no desire? Hagakure gives the following answer:This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai: if by setting one’s heart right every morning and evening, one is able to live as though his body were already dead, he gains freedom in the Way. His whole life will be without blame, and he will succeed in his calling.This advice holds true for how to deal with the sorcerous weaponry of Quimbanda. After all, the Quimbandeiro is the living embodiment of a legacy of wisdom, the memory of death living on in his or her body and soul and moving in his or her life. So, the Quimbandeiro is abso-lute warrior, but he or she must first defeat themselves, and this opens us to the true essence of Quimbanda: it is an art of healing. So, a good understanding of purification, healing baths, fumigations and works for bringing opportunities of goodness into an ill-starred life must be present in the arsenal of a true Quimbandeiro. The Quimbandeiro works in a world of contrasts, and knows how to kindle a fire as much as how to drench a fire whether with water or alcohol.The Sorcerous Technology of Quimbanda Aquimbandeiro will have at his or her disposal a range of sorcerous solutions for accomplishing a given goal. It is at all times wise to calculate matters of justice and strength and to be honest. An important difference between Quimbanda and more freestyle sorcery which uses sorcerous techniques relying on the practitioner’s own soul power is that in Quimbanda we involve a spiritual potency. Hence what we bind and loose is bound to a greater extent than what occurs in a simple bonding between the practitioner and an object in a sympathy or antipathy, as we are adding a named spiritual intelligence that works with us as in a pact."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"106The Exus are spiritual guardians created by Nzambi, so whatever we bind or loose under their gaze will have a cosmic effect and also be bound and loosened elsewhere. This ripple effect is quite marked in Quimbanda and a working towards its intended goal has a tendency to move in mysterious ways. This is dependant on the insight applied in the preparation and execution of a working. I feel that often when mys-tery is involved in the working it is because spirit also wants us to grow wiser in the work, so it is particularly in works of binding an object of desire and works rooted in revenge we see this take shape.It is rare to see fairytale results from binding workings, and this is largely due to the resistance in the object of desire. The less natural the sympathetic relations of the bonds worked the more mysterious and less predictable the result tends to be. So, a binding is often ruled by principles that shift the bonds and re-forge them in a greater harmony, and this can be a process where it is important to take advantage of the opportunities that open and work actively with them. For instance, a binding is done on behalf of a man that wants his wife back. This might seem like a noble cause, but what if the man was abusive? How does this change the way we plan the working, and in this case, is this the working that needs to be done, or is a change in behaviour perhaps a better working in such a case? Likewise, when one is obsessed with the object of desire, what can we expect from a working that is from the beginning fed upon by kiumbas as a result of the quality of the energy that infuses the working? It is important to think before doing, not all works should be done and not all works will give the desired results. On the contrary, a messy and rotten bond is likely to generate unde-sired results, and if the result is manifest, it will come with a bundle of unpleasant energies. I think everyone wanting to create magical love bindings should first read Mrabet’s Love With a Few Hairs as a part of their learning process.Revenge is likewise a bad fuel for magic, and it is bound to bounce back. I know of one fairly recent case where the man in question was hell-bent on murdering a certain juridical official because of false accu-sations. He went out in the Campo Santo and made the working called Dead Man’s Box, which you will find later in this chapter. Within a"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"107week a scandal broke concerning the target; he suffered from a stroke that crippled him and took away his ability to talk. The Tatá who did this was most satisfied and revelled in his success only to find his own health decaying rapidly. Works of vengeance must be cold and calcu-lated; the hot fire tends to call upon kiumbas. When consumed by the fire of passion, pride is fettered and we forget to take simple precau-tions such as salting our steps to mislead the kiumbas, or entering into the necessary regime of purifying baths and the doing of good deeds to help restore the natural balance.This is just an example of many which testifies that these are real forces, and we should work with them with care, knowing why we are doing what, and calculate everything involved and in particular the na-ture of the bond we are working with.On a more metaphysical level, the basic structure of a Quimbanda working is that the subject invites an earthly fire to execute a goal. In this process we need to know the nature of the subject, their motiva-tions, character, emotional balance and so forth. Then in selecting the force to be applied we have numerous variations of this earthly fire; but it is all about fire, passion, heart and blood. This is the fuel we are using to accomplish our result. It is therefore crucial to know as inti-mately as possible the works and possibilities of the fire you are apply-ing, hence my recommendation of approaching Quimbanda as a cult of spirit communion and approaching the spirits as tutors, the true Tatás and Yayas, experienced in life on both sides of the mirror. If we do this we will find that the fires of revenge and desire will be tempered and be replaced by understanding, and in the end better solutions will be pro-vided to accomplish our goals. In this way we will eradicate the biggest pitfall in Quimbanda: to be turned into a mindless toy of the spirits, for the fun of it. The Exus are a law unto themselves, they can be applied to work dynamically in the natural course of the world, but they can also twist it into the macabre and grotesque. We might say that with these spirits there is no such thing as a free lunch; it is an exchange, and the better we bond in communion with them and take them on as teachers the better will this dynamic exchange flow, as they bring balance and cunning to our life instead of anger and drunken foolishness."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"108The Spirit Table The spirit table, also known as a boveda in Caribbean spiritism and mesa branca (white table) in Kardec spiritism and its Umbanda crossovers, is not a universal trait of Quimbanda but a practice adopted by a number of houses in the previous century as a means for reconnecting with ancestors and also for training mediumistic abilities. The spirit table is not a table that is worked directly, but a field for communion with one’s legacy of blood and spirit. It is a simple technique and something that will benefit any practitioner. To set up your spirit table you need to find a corner in your house. The hallway and kitchen are the most favourable, whilst the bedroom is the least favourable. In this corner set up a small table and cover it with a new white cloth, or a cloth owned by someone departed in your family, and dress the table with it. Present on the table should be a white candle and religious tokens representing your blood lineage. Photos of deceased family members should also be placed here. Under the table you will place a small dish of tobacco soaked in alcohol and coffee that will be changed before the table is used and thrown out afterwards (the plate is brought back and sea salt is added to it). This dish serves to attract hostile influences that will feed upon this offering instead of you, or what is given to the ancestors. On this table you will also have eight or nine glasses, all but one being of the same size and type. The last one should be bigger than the others. For common use the smaller vessels are placed in a circle around the bigger one and are filled with fresh water before the table is used. You will normally offer bread, coffee and alcohol, but this must be mediated by the preference of departed family members. In time the table will gather symbols and tokens of what is a spiritual legacy as well, meaning, if boxing is a vital part of your life you might add pictures of famous boxers, as you will do with saints and thinkers that have influenced your life in meaningful ways.The practices are fairly simple and the basic procedure involves prayers, readings from sacred texts, and contemplation. It will be large-ly beneficial to compose a hymn, poem or prayer honouring your blood ancestors, and use this as an opening whenever the table is used. The"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"109spirit table is a practical and pragmatic tool for communing with the spirits and the more the practitioner researches their blood ancestors and applies this knowledge in the use of the spirit table the better the results will be.One technique is particularly auspicious for developing mediumistic skills. You will elect a time, whether every day or every week, but it must be the exact same day and hour. You will then light the white can-dle, offer bread and coffee and fill the jars with water. Tap on the table and state that you are there for the sake of communion. You will then stay quiet for a designated time, at least 30 minutes, and simply remain attentive. Over time you will develop skills of discernment where you will easily separate your own thoughts and inner states from the spir-itual influx. It is this state developed by this simple practice that opens the power zones of the body to allow the spirit to enter. It is advisable to keep a Spirit Book to hand where you can note down your experiences with the spirit table.abcd"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"110The spirit table is never worked, but it is possible to arrange the table in ways that give the attending spirits a particular direction (see illustra-tion p. 109). For instance you can fill the vessels with ice cubes and add bay laurel, basil and a domination wood asking in the form of prayers to gain support in adversity, for example in a court case. Ice added to the vessels in a circle can also be used to calm down and exorcise hos-tile and overly hot spiritual influences (fig. a). You can also arrange the glasses in a V shape by placing the larger vessel at the back of the table (fig. b). This is said to neutralise hostile spiritual influences and negative ancestral spirits. If this shape is reversed, by placing the larger vessel in front allowing the V shape to take shape towards the back it is said to call upon benign spirits and positive ancestors (fig. c). It is also possible to arrange the glasses in the form of a pyramid for works of elevation, both of spirit and the soul of the practitioner (fig. d). Here prayers are presented and novenas directed towards patron saints.The Vessel of Devotion Brass vessels for imprisoning spirits in the goetic tradition find their counterpart in Quimbanda where vessels of copper, iron or terracotta are prepared to seat the spirit. The idea behind this is to anchor the spirit by constructing the vessel in a way harmonious to the spirit’s substance and then call it to dwell within. This is not a spirit trap or an Aladdin’s lamp used to imprison djinn. The spirit vessel – or assentamento – is like preparing a body for the spirit to reside within.The vessel of devotion is not an assentamento, but a seat of comfort for the spirit that can assist in making the relationship with it harmoni-ous. It takes three weeks to construct and you will need to reserve the time from sundown to midnight for three successive Fridays to make this vessel.First you need to locate a suitable vessel, which is a deep dish made from terracotta, clay or porcelain. On the first Friday wash this vessel in alcohol and raw tobacco and place two candles inside it, one red and one black. Light the candles and present a glass of cachaça or similar to the vessel and state your purpose in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"112Masters and Fathers of the powers of QuimbandaIt is me (state your full name three times) that is gathered here before youGuide my hand and eye as I walk out in your kingdomsLead me well so your seat can also be made wellSalvé Exu Rei!Then take cachaça, tobacco and three coins and walk out in the world to find a crossroad that calls your attention. Here you take earth from the four corners of the crossroad, pouring the cachaça and leaving the tobacco and coins at the centre of the crossroad. Upon returning home add the earth to the vessel and place the vessel with the candles lit by your bed. Allow the candles to burn down. This is done three times, using three different crossroads a different one each successive week. Upon returning from the third journey, draw the ponto of Exu Rei, which is a crossroad of male tridents, burn it and add the ashes to the vessel together with dried chilli peppers and tobacco.On this third night offer three candles, one red, one black and one white and place them around the vessel. The vessel is now ready and can be used as a seat of devotion for the Exu of your choosing. The vessel is placed upon the ponto of the Exu or in front of a charged effigy repre-senting him and worked as a means for communion.Healing Waters Magical baths or amací should form part of any spiritual and magical tradition. After all we are speaking about the world of matter, so our matter should be at all times in a good state to be worked with and worked by! It is amazing how many problems and difficulties can be solved by the physical and spiritual cleanliness created by amaci. Water and herbs can fortify the soul, ease the mind and agitate the spirit.

It is of the fires of the night and pertains to the night. But it is our conception of black magic itself that needs to be altered. Black Magic, also called low magic, is about using the material world in pragmatic ways to accomplish miracles and goals which encompass both the most amoral and worthy of aspirations. I will therefore present some examples of the variety of workings within Quimbanda, all of which have in common the practical use of our material condition. Some of these workings involve cruelty, and I do not endorse this, but yet, this is part of the history of Quimbanda and should be presented at least for its value, not only historically, but because it gives an insight into how the natural powers and kingdoms are believed to effectuate change by virtue of its properties.Low magic and high magic are common denominators for black and white magic. High and white magic are the godly and lawful magic, with the black and low magic being forbidden and demonic. Essentially there is little difference in practice, it is only a question of the source of the power. The themes of black magic are sortilege, necromancy and spirit traffic with beings other than angels. The condemnation of the Black Arts as forbidden in past times was largely rooted in the idea that man was limited, and that trespassing into divine domains was ungodly and forbidden. This idea is in contrast to the Kongo worldview that sees everything that is as extensions of Nzambi, God. Hence the growth of wisdom can effectuate an unleashing of creative powers in mankind, and like Nzambi we can become creators and masters of life and des-tiny. In Quimbanda we work both domains, high and low, hence the existence of saints and the syncretism with Solomonic ideas and spirits. The understanding however is different. For the Quimbandeiro it is about balance and not a battle between good and evil, high and low. It is simply a consequence of the realization that working night and fire constantly can lead to the practitioner being consumed by it, so sun-light and fresh air is necessary to keep the practitioner stable and wise."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"116From this perspective, whenever a human intercessor is affecting a cure it is as much black magic as if a person is causing magically-ignited havoc. The term black magic also denotes the racist judgments of earlier writers who deemed the wonderworks of Africans that had a mate-rial effect ungodly, nefarious and dangerous. Hence we have the double bind of black associated with low, or black magic as well as the people of a continent viewed as alien and dangerous by the Europeans. In the case of Quimbanda the repertoire of black magic is a synthesis of Af-rican traditional workings mediated upon the legacy of St. Cyprian of Antioch.For many of these workings lifeforce offerings are given to support it and to give the working spirit vital energy to execute its work with. We might say that a lifeforce offering serves as fuel for the work done and is an integral part of the cult of Quimbanda. As the saying goes, if there is no blood, there is no Quimbanda. The preferred lifeforce offer-ings of Exu are goats and roosters, but feathered animals in general as well as rodents can all be used. It should however be said that lifeforce offerings should only be performed by a Tatá or Yaya, this is because of the sanctity of the act itself and also because of the energetic circuit established that might be too hot to handle for the unsteady ones.Dead Man’s BoxFor this working you will need to make wax figures of the target or targets and have present holy water, needles with heads, a piece of black cloth, a wooden coffin and a white candle. The work is better done on Mondays and in particular the Easter tide is auspicious for such work-ings. Perform this ritual in the Cemetery and make sure that payment is given to the Gate and the Cruzeiro. Then you need to locate a de-parted one who agrees to work with you. This being done you will light the white candle at the foot of the grave and baptise the dolls in the name of the targets and sing to the Exu chosen to aid you in this work. Prayers, songs and vivid visualizations need to be presented and it is crucial that you sense a controlled but raging fire building up within"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"117you. This being done the dolls will be baptised again. Wash the coffin in cachaça and place a layer of graveyard dirt in the bottom leaving it at the foot of the grave. With solemn prayers you offer breath and intent on the needles and insert them slowly in the desired parts of the doll. This done, the doll is veiled in black cloth and placed inside the coffin. A hand of tobacco and fresh red peppers must be placed around the corpse doll and the white candle placed inside. Again prayers, songs and vivid visualizations are offered as the candle is broken in two, placed inside of the coffin and the lid is closed. The coffin should then be bur-ied at the foot of the grave as you make your statement out loud seven times in the name of the departed one and the Exu being worked. You will promise the departed one to return on three successive Mondays the following three weeks and offer up prayers and give water and cof-fee to the departed one. Upon the work being done you will arrange for a mass of the dead in the name of the departed one that agreed to help you.The Killing ToadGive Exu Porteira a yellow candle, three red roses, three cigars, one bottle of champagne, a box of matches and three coins. The working itself can be done with the help of St. Cyprian, Exu João Caveira or Exu Tatá Caveira. It is also possible to apply all three of them. Give a black candle to Omolu at the Cruzeiro and ask him to guard you as you work. The offerings for João Caveira and Tatá Caveira are a bottle of ma-rafo (i.e. cachaça), seven boxes of matches and seven black candles. The work should not be done at a tomb, but within the cemetery. When the place is located you will bring the offerings, mark the ponto with red pemba on black cloth and place the box with the toad on the ponto, and the offerings around the cloth. You will also place bread and water on the cloth. Now, in the form of prayers and spontaneous curses against the person you seek to harm, write the target’s name on a piece of white cloth, crossing it three or seven times. The cloth is then placed in the mouth of the toad which you will sew up slowly with black thread as curses are spoken. The idea behind this malefica is to make the target"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"118wither away, so this purpose must be stated as a part of the prayers/curses. Then place the toad inside the box together with the bread and water and bury it. As the toad suffers and withers away, so will the tar-get suffer and undergo misfortune.The Invisible SnakeOn a Sunday when the Moon is waning you will kill a snake or viper. In the first hour of the Moon, light a fire and place the snake in an iron cauldron and burn it to charcoal and ashes. This being done, mark the pontos of Exu Lucifer, Exu Capa Preta and Exu das Cobras on black cloth around the fire and call them. Sing and pray repeatedly over the cauldron the following:Great Lords of the Abyss of HellLucifer, Capa Preta, das CobrasHeed my call and my yellsMay the soul of this snakeMake my adversaries submissive to meWith this their sight I do breakAnd they shall not be able to seeSalve Seu Lucifer!Salve Seu Capa Preta!Salve Seu Cobra!When the snake is turned into ash, consume some of it and cut some pieces from the black cloth where the pontos were marked and wrap the ashes in it.

It is done on a Friday, close to midnight. Bring with you a bottle of beer, a bottle of cachaça, seven red candles and seven black candles, six cigars, one meter of black cloth, one meter of red cloth, and six boxes of matches. You should start the working in front of your tronco, feeding your spirits and stating the intent of the working: to break a specific working. Then walk out and pay adoration to the first six crossroads you meet, leaving some drops of cachaça at each, and at the seventh stop. Here make the sign of the cross and on the left side present the red cloth, and draw the ponto for Exu Tranca Ruas, or another Exu you have a personal and good relationship with, to fortify and protect the work. Give three boxes of matches and the beer together with three black and four red candles and three cigars. Ask license to enter the crossroad to perform the work. Enter the crossroad and present the black cloth and draw the ponto of Tranca Ruas or Sete Encruzilhadas. Make a circle of the candles and light them, and present the cachaça on the ponto together with the matches and cigars. Here you should sing and pray to Exu, lament if you will and present your case. When done, empty the cachaça over the cloth and leave the crossroad by tak-ing seven steps backwards, greeting the guardian of the working as you do so. Upon the seventh step, turn around and walk away without look-ing back.The Magic of the Padê – Works to Gain ProtectionThe padê is a flour-based food dish that can be used in a great variety of situations. It automatically gives protection and gains the good will of Exu when presented. As such it is famous for its capacity for open-ing opportunities and removing blockages. It is a prized offering in all kingdoms and lines and in order to make a simple padê, you will do as follows:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"120Take flour of corn, cassava or manioc and heat it on the stove with gen-erous amounts of palm oil.

Cachaça is poured over it togeth-er with a slice of raw beef and it is presented in front of the tronco, at the crossroad or in the kingdom worked. There are several varieties of padê, but this one is a general one that can be used by votaries in a great variety of situations.The Knight’s Conquest – For Conquest of an Object of DesireThis working is a padê made in the same way as the previous, but with some alterations. This padê is not made with cachaça but with cham-pagne and absinthe or chartreuse. You will also need generous amounts of honey. It is excellent with the Exus in the line of Malei and in the kingdom of the Encruzilhadas. Make the padê in the usual way, but when presented it must be accompanied by seven red roses free from thorns, and seven red and seven black candles. The roses should be tied with red cord and placed on the padê. To the padê you will also add an apple that you cut in two. Take out the core and place in the centre of the dish and with a virgin needle inscribe the name of the two people you wish to see merge – a virgin needle for each name on separate halves of the apple. Then cross the two names seven times on a piece of red cloth and place it inside the cavity where the core used to be, and drench it with honey and red peppers. Join the halves and tie it up like a ball with red cord and place it in the centre of the padê. Offer up pontos and prayers to the chosen Exu and take the padê to a place close to the dwelling of the target and hide it well close by. Some rose petals can be taken from the padê and left at the gate of the target. This will sweeten your way towards conquest."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"121The Hole of Enemies – A Work to Destroy EnemiesThis working is done with any Exu of the Street or the kingdom of the Encruzilhadas, and works well with Exu das Sete Cruzes. On a Sat-urday night, under a waning moon, locate a desolate place; the more barren the location the better. You need to bring with you dark glass bottles, needles and small knives, one cigar, ten black candles and Af-fliction mironga, a powder made in the following way:Take fæces of cat and dog, ataare (alligator pepper), chilli pepper, corredeira (Euphorbia hirta), bonedust (human), mamona (castor plant/Ricinus communis) and a drop of mercury. This is burnt to ashes to make this powder. The Affliction mironga belongs to St Cyprian, Exu Meia Noite and Exu das Sete Cruzes and must be made on a Friday under their watchful eyes.At the designated place pour a circle of cachaça around the spot where you will dig the hole. Into this hole break the bottles and pour cachaça over them. Arrange the candles in a circle around the hole and light the cigar allowing the smoke to enter the hole. Do this while calling upon the Exu that will assist you in the working. Write the name of the target on pieces of cloth or paper as you do this, cross the name several times and repeat several times, constantly merging your inner violent fire with powerful images aiming to destroy your adversary. Sprinkle the mironga over the glass and add needles, then the names. Add the rest of the mironga and more needles and knives. Make sure the knives are penetrating the name. Pour cachaça over it and place it all inside the hole. Over all this three black candles are placed and lit. Leave the working in silence with three steps backwards and purge yourself upon arriving home. Additionally, some of the mironga can be thrown at the door of the target after this work is done. This is bound to turn the life of the target into a living hell and caution must be demonstrated with such workings as this, as they are almost impossible to reverse."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"122The Table of Cure – A Work to Heal a Sick ChildThis work is done with Exu Malé or any Exu or Pomba Gira in the kingdom of das Praias. You will need a new white cloth, a plain white cup, a bottle of white or transparent glass, three white roses, water from a stream, and three small white plates. Take the cloth and cover the table that is used for the working. This must be done with care and genuine intent to effect a cure. Place the bottle with the river water at one end of the table and the cup at its side. Place a white candle and three white dishes, one rose in each dish on the table.The afflicted child should be presented to the table near the items offered. The following prayer should be said over the child:Powerful emissaries of the kingdom of watersWith all my powers and all strength in my heartI shall transform this water into your medicineWith your blessing this water is now medicine for NNWith this I greet you and thank youAnd I stay firm in my unwavering convictionSo may it be.At this point offer up prayers and pontos to the Exu chosen to assist the working. The head of the child should be washed in the water and the roses taken to an ocean or river either by the child, or in the name of the child, whilst petitioning for a cure and healing. The water should be consumed in equal parts over the course of seven days to effectuate a cure.Blinding the Evil EyeIt is believed that the evil eye, Ajô Cocorô, has its source in the heart, because the evil eye is a projection of what lies in the heart. Conse-quently, in workings of Quimbanda it is the heart that is attacked. One popular method is to take a fresh bull’s heart and baptise it in the name of the person who has given the evil eye. It is even better, if possible,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"123to drape the heart in a piece of clothing of the person in question. The heart is worked on Mondays or Saturdays and is bound with black cord and filled with the crossed name of the target together with sea salt, rue and rosemary. The heart is taken to a crossroad close to a garbage dump or close to a large swamp. Here Exu is called upon and given peppers, cachaça, candles and cigars. The ponto of the Exu is drawn on black cloth and the heart placed on top. As pontos cantados are sung and prayers are offered, the heart is stabbed repeatedly as you declare how this will break the evil eye. The heart is then wrapped in the black cloth and disposed of in a place of high activity in the kingdom of the Lira, for instance in some party strip or a place where the bars are crowded. This working is better done with Exus of the Lira, but can be used with the help of most Exus.The Drunken ProphetThis is a technique, not strictly of a Quimbanda origin, that works well in the kingdom of the Lira. At times we are in need of answers and to use the powers in the kingdom of Lira for this purpose is a great way to obtain oracles. Go to your spirit table and tronco and light a candle for the spirit you seek counsel from. Then go alone to the Lira and seek out a proper bar or tavern. The tavern should be one where drunkards over the age of forty hang out; by this I mean those cheap and worn-down taverns. The intent made with prayers, candles, cachaça and cigar prior to setting out ensures that you will be guided to the right place. Take your time, reflect upon your confusion and enter when you find the place that holds your answers. Here buy yourself a drink and soak up the atmosphere, sense where the prophet, or prophets, are and go to their table with drinks for all – as the drunker the prophet is the better. Make a toast to life, love, death and all its mystery and see what hap-pens during the conversation. If matters proceed slowly, buy a second and third round, direct the conversation towards your field of confu-sion and listen. Setting out with this intent will ensure a temporary possession of a vessel who will become your oracle and dissolve your"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"124confusion. Pay the prophet with yet another round of drinks and upon returning home give thanks to Exu.Obsession FarewellObsession is perhaps the most harmful danger in Quimbanda and many fall prey to it. Obsessions are caused by kiumbas, and they need to be exorcised if they have contaminated someone with their particular ob-session. It should be clear that spiritually inflicted obsessions can lead to insanity and death, so it is important to take this seriously and start the cleaning and healing process. The cure does not rest in some dra-matic working, but in a change in spiritual routine and conduct.Firstly, a deliberate wish for getting rid of the obsessive spirits must be in place and a daily regime of exorcising baths (amaci) must be un-dertaken. The afflicted must refrain from intrigue and gossip of any form and avoid intoxication by drink, drugs or negativity. Works of charity can also be a good option in such cases.Lastly, the spirit table can be worked several times a day to cultivate serenity and the warding off of hostile influences. It might also be help-ful to make a novena to one of the three prime saints of Quimbanda, St. Michael, St. Anthony or St. Cyprian; this is because they serve as calm influences high up in the spiritual hierarchy. Nine days of diligent attention to ritual protocol will in most cases be sufficient to get rid of these harmful influences. Sea salt and rue can also be placed in the corners of the house for the period of purging. The nine days should be ended by making a floorwash where, in particular, the corners of the house and bathroom are washed clean. The floor wash consists of one bottle of cachaça or similar, generous amounts of lavender and sea salt mixed with pure, preferably holy water."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"125Sweet WorldThis working is best done on Fridays with the kingdom of the Lira or das Praias in particular. Take a blue candle and inscribe on it with a needle the name of the person you seek to sweeten.

After, prepare a white dish and in the bottom of the dish draw the ponto of the Exu you will work with. Fill the dish with flax seeds, rice and nuts. Pour honey and palm oil over it. Next light the blue candle and give Exu three red candles and one cigar together with a glass of sweet red wine. This should all be placed in the kitchen, at the fireplace or stove.This being done, write the name of the person crossed seven times on a piece of paper and place it in a pan filled with equal parts pure wa-ter and brown sugar or honey (be careful here, do not use pure honey as it is flammable, sugar-diluted varieties are better). Stir the name into this solution, praying and singing from your heart that the person will be sweet. The sweetening can be of someone infested with anger or someone who seeks to advance in matters of love. The ingredients are left to boil for some minutes, then placed in another vessel and given to Exu together with cachaça and palm oil. Allow it to cool down naturally and the sweetening is done and can be worked upon actively.A Ritual for making St. Cyprian your PatronThis procedure involves a nine day dedication for installing the saint. Obtain an image of him, be it a figurine or picture. You should also have at your disposal red and black cord, two white candles and one black together with St. Cyprian oil that must have been prepared beforehand.

You can hear opinions which vary from it being Oxala and Nzambi to Satanas, the Devil and Lucifer. These are all masks of dispersion because the Maioral is in truth the Archan-gel Michael. This suggests a special dynamic between forces conceived of as opposing each other which is curiously enough a Bogomil idea. I am not suggesting an actual Bogomil component is found within Quimbanda, but there are clearly similar spiritual potencies and phi-losophies which moved the Bogomils as those which moved the masters of Quimbanda.The Archangel Michael represents the spiritual fire of Heaven and the solar ability of overcoming, the necromantic gift par excellence, which generates this dual bond with the King of the World, this being Uriel, Lumiel or Lucifer. So, how should we understand this complex? The Maioral is the Archangel while the King Exu is the Devil, the Lord of the World, of the temporal state. This means that Exu Rei is an office which can be assumed by a handful of the Exus in the upper reaches of the hierarchy. Usually this equates to Exu Mor, Exu Rei das Sete En-cruzilhadas or Exu Lucifer. Potentially, Exu Calunga can also assume the supreme crown, but I have never heard of this, though I have heard of a few temples that consider Satanael their Exu Rei and Maioral.Fontenelle defined Exu Rei as the Absolute, the crowned powers of Exu and the sum of all evil. One is warned against working with him in the context of black magic, instead high magic and kabala are advocated. There is a general concern with avoiding the harder and brutal manifes-tations of these powers considered to be essential tension by nature.Similar ideas are found in the cult of Obeah, as was taught to me through a Trinidadian lineage. Here we find Papa Bones to be the king of the cult and he is, in many ways, similar to Omolu. Papa Bones is often described and depicted as a cosmic skeleton. Papa Bones is also understood to be a trickster spirit, but he also has a darker counterpart, Sasabonsam, a monster from the forests in the kingdom of Ashanti. Sasabonsam and Papa Bones are the malefic and benevolent reflexes of"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"138the same form, and are as such suggestive of the conflict inherent in both Satan and Lucifer that finds resolution in St. Michael. A similar dynamic seems to be at play in the mysterious Maioral as well.There is a conflict, but a dynamic conflict, which is mirrored in the fight between the higher and lower soul attempting to take control of our actions. It is man who instigates the war between Satan and Luci-fer. For those who are motivated by satanic impulses, Exu turns into the devil; for those motivated by aspiration to the divine mind, Exu will turn into a powerful guardian and loyal friend, a manifestation of the Absolute. The manifestation is related to the worshipper’s heart and soul. As we have seen so far in this grammar, the problem of evil is far more complex than the common distinction of Christianity, which simply separates the infernal and empyrean kingdom. Let us recall that the Bogomil heretics believed that God created Satanael from his shad-ow. It is important to note that the name of the angel who fell originally had the ending –el, signifying his divine status as a son of God. Lucifer, Satanael and Satan are perhaps better viewed as a tri-fold reflection of the King of Shadows himself. Lucifer represents the Promethean ele-ment introduced into creation, the principle of movement, change and wisdom. He is our higher soul, the divine reason or a vehicle for nous connecting us to all things in great harmony. Satanael, on the other hand, represents the bridge towards our lower nature, he is the deity of choice and the challenge that opens the possibility of entering within the kingdom of the emotional and ecstatic life that should ideally be subdued by the faculty of reason. If we allow our emotional life to assume the throne of our being we easily fall into corruption, and in-stead of being kings and queens of our domain, we enter into slavery and confusion. By crossing the bridge forged by Satanael, we turn our-self into Satan, the exalted perversion of spirit with no recourse to the golden chain or light-seed of divine becoming. In accordance with the via negativa, it is easy to become convinced that ‘evil’ is the absence of God. And truly, we can agree that absence of the light-seed facilitates the corruption of mind, soul and heart, leading to a fall of our own be-ing towards matter, like Satanael when he lost his divine status and fell away from the source."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"139The term black magic has a multitude of understandings and, sure enough, all possible interpretations of black magic can be validated in the realm of Exu, because we have the threefold segmentation of his realm: it both represents a Mystery in itself – that we shall, for the time being, leave somewhat concealed – and also, the fall and corrup-tion that man can bring upon himself. If we cannot keep our nature high and our character good in our Promethean pursuits, the balance between the sensual and intellectual world can collapse: we fall into Hell where Satan is the King, and we lose our serenity and mindful-ness. Ultimately this leads to activities associated with Black Magic, in the sense of them being motivated by the corruption of the soul. Such magical acts aim towards manipulating the will of others on the basis of satisfying the hunger and drives of the lower soul. This is negative magic and contradictory to the very essence of Lucifer himself. We must understand that Lucifer does not make choices on behalf of man, he represents an option, like Satan, and it is this paradoxical and intense contradiction that makes Quimbanda a path sharper than any blade. Contrasted with many other paths of magic and evolution, the danger of falling into corruption and insanity is far more prominent.Calling Lucifer is very different from calling Satan, and Exu Lucifer is of a wholly different spiritual coloration. While Satan is working on our desires, urges and impulses by operating on them in a hidden and perverse manner, Lucifer works on our higher mind. Connecting with this force will often be dangerous for the unprepared mind, due to the immense pressure his nature represents. Even low levels of manifesta-tion always involve obtaining the serenity and purity of all possible forces earlier present in the temple. Everything is cleaned away to make room for just a small amount of this force. A manifestation of the fallen nature is not signified with the Luciferian dignity, which aims at re-embracing the divine fire. Worship at the table of Satan, where all vices and perversions are served in the halls of Hell, is for those who see Exu as the portal to short-term goals and direct all attention to the flesh and their immediate need. By intricate mechanisms, Exu can ignite the fire of the flesh and open up the labyrinths of our own lower soul with"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"140the same ease as the doors to Jerusalem on high are flung open for the seeker to see the glory of paradise.Exu Rei represents the expression of both your higher and lower aspirations to the full extent of their nature, and in this many Seekers go wild or resort to explanations based on biased dualism. This is again related to the reputation of the various grammars of the Arte, such as the Lemegeton, ascribed to Solomon, the grimoire ascribed to Honorius, the Black Pullet and Grimorium Verum which all have a sinister reputa-tion. As the enlightened reader knows, this is far from the truth: here is another challenge for the seeker presented by Hermes Trismegistus himself to sanctify the quest. However, these grammars of the Arte can very well lead one man to the regent of Hell, as they lead another to the King of Knowledge. They simply reveal the plain truth, that man him-self is man’s greatest enemy. The choice lies with the Pilgrim, not in the thorn-road of which the grimoires are the map. Most assume that the summoner is of a Christian orientation or at least a mystic, since this aspiration opens a dual way between the empyrean and infernal realms, enabling the magus to find balance between the kingdoms. Seen from such a perspective, it is understandable that a Christian-oriented gnosis is often prominent in the grimoires.Given this we yet again find St. Michael the Archangel being the power that contains this dynamic flux and frustration and enables a stable work to be possible with the legions of Hell. In this function he is the tyrant of all Crossroads.Sacred Items: Hyssop, Galbanum, all night blooming flowers, cherry, tobacco, gold, the colours red, black, and white, tridents, diamonds and quartz crystal.Lucifer: Gold, red, white, roses, lilies, bloodstone.Satanael: Red, black, gold, mandrake, obsidian.Synthesis: Crystalline with shades of red, mistletoe, opal.Satan: Black, asafoetida, henbane, onyx."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"141Pontos Cantados of Exu ReiA encruza é de Exu,Afirmo e não errei (bis)Saravá Povo da Quimbanda,Saravá nosso Exu Rei.

His mythical ori-gin can be traced back to the destruction of Solomon’s temple, which was constructed on the mountain Mor or Moriah, which is latin for death. In the seal of Belzebub we even find the insignia of the pillars of Solomon’s temple, a J and a B. It is an adaptation of this seal that is often used as his ponto riscado. These letters are both Jak-in and Bo-az as well as yud and beith. Jak means he will establish, and bo means confusion. From the destruction of the temple confusion is established and man is given an opportunity for deliverance, but he is also hurled towards the terrestrial where demonic intellects that attempt to pervert mankind are found. As such, Exu Mor symbolises the house (beith) of confusion. Martines de Pasqually says about this that: The number of confusion of the second column is designated by the binary rank held by the first letter of the word Boaz. Ultimately the pillar of confusion carried the secrets of Cain’s legacy as the pillar of Jakin veiled the secrets of the descendants of Seth. So the mystery of Exu Mor is contained in yet another observation of Pasqually: Confusion derives from two powers in opposition, to sustain on the one hand, and to liberate on the other. In this we are also reminded of how Al-Arabi saw Iblis as the power that affirmed the perfection of the Creator’s design. We should also mention that the name Beelzebuth or Bael Zebub does not necessarily refer to The Lord of Flying Things, such as flies, but it can also refer to the Lord of Zebub, a place of unknown location, that might describe the location of Mount Mor. It can also mean beith zebul, in conformity with what is written in Kings i 8:13 meaning the house upon high which opens up avenues of understanding Exu Mor that harmonise with the confusion arising from dyadic opposition. From this origin Exu Mor represents a profound principle as being the Lord of the House of Confusion. This might be taken as the symbolism of Janus in his capacity of presenting multiple choices for the seeker, and herein is found both his mystery and his danger."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"147Beelzebub is the second in command in the legions of Quimbanda. This Exu is a high ranking general and king of this realm. He rules the spirits of the streets, and is said to be one of the more aggressive Exus. His prominence amongst the ranks of Exu is probably due to his renown as god of the witches, and also the fame the Kabala achieved amongst students of the occult in the 13th and 14th century. The ten sephirot that express the faces of the godhood also have their dark reflection. Many of these spirits carry clear indications of belonging to Geburah, the sephira of wrath, blood and energy. MacGregor Mathers gives the fol-lowing hierarchy for the sephirot:1 • Satan and Moloch2 • Beelzebub3 • Lucifuge4 • Ashtaroth5 • Asmodeus6 • Belphegor7 • Baal8 • Adramelech9 • Lilith10 • NaamahThe interesting point to note here is that most of these deities represent the gods venerated by tribes that were in opposition to what came to be known as the Israelites. Moloch was a Canaanite god of fire. Asmodeus, a Persian spirit with close terrestrial connotations was incorporated in the Jewish myths as an enemy of God. In the case of Belzebub, the probable origin is Bel-se-buth; or ultimately, the great rival of Jahveh, the Moabite god Baal Zebub or simply Baal, who was referred to as the adversary by Hasidic Jews in the 18th century. An argument may be made against Belzebub being a demonic deity presiding over flies; this attribute may arise from confusion with some Mesopotamian fiend. We find the same theme in Belphegor, which is probably a corruption of Baal Peor, a god of licentiousness depicted in a form typical of the ithyphallic Priapus, a proper icon for the God of the Witches.

These few comments are made to remind you, dear reader, of the complexity of the matter at hand.We also have a famous confession quoted by Richard Cavendish, the monk Jean del Vaux attested, without torture, that he and some oth-er people worshipped Belzebub in 1595 as their Grand Master, which naturally brings to mind the accusations hurled at the Knights of the Temple. It seems that the icon of Belzebub, Lord of Flies, Prince of Seraphim and Daimon of the month of July, in his ambivalence and capacity as a repository of the many gods that opposed Jahveh, can shed even more light on the nature of Quimbanda and especially its relation to European witchcraft practices. Certainly great, arcane teachings re-lated to the practice of the Knights of de Molay can be discovered with this Exu as one’s guiding spirit.But the references do not stop there. If we look at the descriptions given of the infernal council both in de Plancy and also in Haggadic and Talmudic sources Asmodeus and Moloch are both deities that form part of the spiritual substance of Exu Mor. I would even go so far as to state that there is no essential difference between Asmodeus and Exu Mor, but only those which forms of reverence, culture and time have made evident. The Asmodeus connection is interesting in the greater scope of Quimbanda presented in this work because Asmodeus was, as in the legends of Exu Mor, involved in the building of Solomon’s temple, and hence the one who would bring about its destruction. Rab-binical sources tell us of a certain Ashmedai, considered to be a fellow of good will, until he became ensnared by Bathsheba, one of Solomon’s wives, the one who was consumed by the spirit of Lilith. Ashmedai in the throes of passion became enflamed with the spirit of Asmodeus and here we find the origin of Exu Mor. Another haggadic story tells how Asmodeus was the offspring of Adam and Na’amah. Some rabbini-cal sources make an equivalence between Asmodeus and Samael, and through this to the serpent in the Garden of Eden, these three being of the same potency. Yet this is not so, as the serpent pertains to a mystery closely related to Exu Mor, namely the mystery of the Dragon Exu. These mysteries are intimately connected, but the one is not the other."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"149Moloch should also be mentioned, not just because of his fiery tastes, but because his image was composed of seven compartments to receive seven different offerings that were set on fire at the heart of the statue. Moloch, whose name means king, was depicted as a horned bull. The shared sympathy between the goat and the bull in terms of fertility and endurance should be noted. Scrapings of the bones of bulls are a critical and necessary part of his secret. All these forms find their expression in Exu Mor who is basically the erratic and lustful element in Quim-banda, it is the fire of embers drenched in blood and sperm. It is here we find the beginning of ecclesiastical diversity and heresy.Sacred Items: Old sticks and batons, tridents, goatskin and goat skulls, bull and human bones, absinthe, red wine, tobacco, mandrake and myrrh.Iconography: He is depicted as a red goat or bull similar to the depic-tion of Baphomet given by Eliphas Lévi.Pontos Cantados of Exu MorDentro de uma casa velha,Aonde mora escuridão,Ô passa um homem sempre em frente,Mas com seu chapéu na mão,Ô, quem tem asa sempre voa,Ô, que tem fé sempre caminha,Eu não giro na luz não,Porque a noite é sempre minha.Eu andava na beira do trilho,Firmando o meu ponto quanto o trem passou,Eu ouvi timbalá de martelo que veio do inferno,O Diabo mando,Exu é do inferno, O Diabo mandô.Inside an old house,Where darkness lives,Oh a man always passes in front,But with his hat at his hand,Oh, one who has wings always flys,Oh, one who has faith always walks,I don’t spin in the light,’Cause the night is always mine.I was walking at the side of the track,Making my ponto strong when the train passed,I heard the sound of the hammer that came from hell,The Devil has sent,Exu is from hell, the Devil has sent him."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"150It was under the black bridge,I heard a scream for help,Not Umbanda nor Quimbanda,Black Magic comes to work,This man’s eyes have Magic,He does black magic, his father is Barrabas,He does black magic, his father is Belzebu.Foi de baixo da ponte preta,ouvi um grito de socorro,Não umbanda, nem quimbanda,Magia Negra vem trabalhá,Os olhos desse homem tem Magia sim,Magia negra ele faz, Seu Pai é Barrabás,Magia negra ele faz, Seu Pai é Belzebu,Pontos Riscados of Exu MorKabbalistic ponto of Exu Mor."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"151Ponto for manifesting him.

It is also said that this Exu is a patron of homosexuals, given its androgyne nature, but I find this to be questionable since Quimbanda at large is a cult that takes special interest in all things and people who are liminal in society. For the spirits of Quimbanda it is crucial that one is honest and true to oneself, there is really no favoring of one over another. If we follow the association with Yangi we find that this Exu carries a tremendous transformative and eruptive power and can turn wine into water and sweetness into bitterness with great ease.This repeats a similar idea that we find in Janus/Bifrons, who is the doorway to the past and the future. It is the caduceus coiling around the central axis. It is seperation and it is God looking back at himself. It follows from this that this Exu is prone to separate as much as to unite, and every offering made for this Exu must be dual, and preferably con-flicting. For example, a common gift is to give champagne and cachaça, two things that are not normally consumed together. Or gifts are given which are in marked opposition, like sweet and bitter, spicy and milky and so forth. The workings with this Exu follow this form too, and are used to accomplish radical transformations, literally to turn what is bit-ter sweet and what is sweet bitter.We should also take notice that the twain-headedness was not an un-common feature in European demonology. Baal and Asmodeus along with several other goetic spirits, like the dukes of Venus, Aim and Bim, are spoken of as having multiple heads.Sacred Items: Laterite, volcanic minerals, everything bittersweet, forked items in general, wormwood and myrrh.Iconography: A humanoid figure with two heads, at times the body can look like serpents and other times as burning wood.

He further refers to this Exu as the priestess of the Goat of Mendes and in this we see the intimate relationship this spirit has with Exu Mor and Exu das Duas Cabeças. If we turn to the accounts of Strabo we learn that the Goat of Mendes was the ram god Banebdjed, protector of the soul of Osiris. The fusion of Banebdjed, the ram and the goat, were perhaps because Eliphas Lévi saw a similarity in how the sexual cult around these ani-mals of fertility was conducted. In Mendes the ram was revered as the power of fertility, hence the semen of its priesthood was highly valued. It might be that there is a connection between the lost phallus of Osiris and his soul. Lévi however took the ram and referred to it as the Goat of Mendes, inseminator and fornicator with women. In this he was likely influenced both by the image of the whore riding the Beast in the Book of Revelation, as well as the tales told of the practices of witches on the continent paying reverence to a goat with a candle between his horns.Pomba Gira is the protector of women, a fierce, great adversary. In workings of love and the unjust treatment of women, she is the spirit we call upon. Many are of the opinion that no spell is complete unless Exu Pomba Gira has intervened. As Klephoth she is a serpent’s nest and a legion in its own right, a celebration of the female essence and its myriad of reflections. It is the power protected by the spirits of Quim-banda, because it is from her that their power is made possible.Sacred Items: Champagne, cigarillos, perfume, jewelry, velvet, pearls, Dama de Noite (Cestrum nocturnum), Jasmine, Roses and Willows.Iconography: She is depicted as a free woman, proud of her sensuality and womanhood, usually challengingly dressed in red and black, some-times showing her breasts."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"156Pontos Cantados of Exu Pomba GiraO galo cacarecou,Oh Pomba Gira,Oh Pomba Gira,Oh guingangá.Pomba Gira girá,Pomba Gira gire,Tatáretá Tatáretê,Pomba Gira chega,Pomba Gira chegou,Pomba Gira girou,É a muié de Sete Exus,Sá Pomba Gira chegou.Pomba Gira, Pomba Gira,Pomba gira, tatá crué,Olha Pomba Gira, Pomba Gira,Pomba Gira, tatá crué.Tala, Tala-tá na Pomba Gira,Tala, tala, para que não caia,Tala, Tala-tá na Pomba Gira,Tala, tala para que não caia.Ponto Riscado of Exu Pomba GiraPonto for workings.The rooster sung,Oh Pomba Gira,Oh Pomba Gira,Oh guingangá.Pomba Gira girá,Pomba Gira gire,Tatáretá Tatáretê,Pomba Gira arrives,Pomba Gira arrived,Pomba Gira spun,She is woman of Seven Exus,Lady Pomba Gira arrived.Pomba Gira, Pomba Gira,Pomba Gira, cruel tatá,Look Pomba Gira, Pomba Gira,Pomba Gira, cruel tatá.It’s there, it’s there in Pomba Gira,It’s there, it’s there so it will not fall,It’s there, it’s there in Pomba Gira,It’s there, it’s there so it will not fall."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"157Exu Omolu Nothing created is ever lost in nature. Everything is subject to transformation. Omolu is the keeper of this secret. He is the graveyard dirt where all possible influences from the soul and the sub-terrestrial are parted, brought together again and re-established by the hand of transformation. He is depicted as a red-robed skeleton holding a cutlass and a cross, surrounded by sepulchres and coffins. Omolu is the man at the gate, the torch in the portal, the mirror of what comes after life. He is the cross found planted in the center of the Calunga, to which all veneration is given.Omolu, Obaluwaye and Soponno are all names of the original Yoruba Orisa that became incorporated in Umbanda/Quimbanda at some point between the last part of the 18th century and the first part of the 19th century. It is reasonable to assume that Omolu found his place within Quimbanda through similar avenues as the Orisa Èsú; by association and potency. Omolu and Obaluwaye means the same, the Lord of Earth but aiye which is usually translated as earth has a wider connotation and might be better translated as the field of human activ-ity, because aiye is really the crossroad where the visible and invisible worlds meet. Death and life merge here constantly. Omolu as brother of Shango and Lord of smallpox and infectious diseases, with mosqui-tos and ants as his messengers, carries a vibration most accommodating to the nocturnal fire of Quimbanda. In Umbanda, Omolu and Nana Burucu (alternate Yoruba spelling, Nana Buluku) are considered the grandparents of Jesus Christ and parents of Oxalá. In Africa, Omolu is a sort of dread king on the outskirts that one appeases to keep disease away, or summons for war; usually counting on the fact that his active powers create collateral damage. As the Lord of infectious disease he is also capable of miraculous healing. In Umbanda he is syncretised with St. Blaise, St. Lazarus, St. Roque and on rare occasions with St. Nicholas. These are seen as various stages of maturity of Exu Omolu. He is also given the form of São Bento, a black-cloaked saint flanked by a raven who has a church dedicated to him in the heart of São Paulo. Heretics and witches were executed outside this church which was built on ground sacred to the Indians."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"158As mentioned, Omolu is the same as Obaluwaye, but even if there are similarities to be found it is interesting to look somewhat closer at who this spirit really is. The apparent confusion came into being through two avenues: one was the syncretism with the Saints and the other was through Candomblé. In Candomblé there is a tendency to equate Omolu and Obaluwaye, or if there is difference it is one of generation, Omolu being an older representative of Obaluwaye. This is quite cor-rect as the name Omolu means child of God and denotes a very immedi-ate descent and relation to God. The cult of Omolu is closely related to the mysteries of death and its transformation, while Obaluwaye is a de-ity of disease, especially smallpox, cholera and malaria and is the same force working during the daytime. Obaluwaye’s reputation as a healer is often preferred over his misanthropic qualities. Certainly they both can heal, but Omolu is more ready to do such things than Obaluwaye.The power of healing is found in the mystery of St. Lazarus, who suffered death and resurrection. This saint has been ascribed to both Obaulwaye and Omolu, and thus represents the magnificent powers and mysteries of Omolu/Obaluwaye. In reality it is Nana Buluku, the mother of Omolu, who represents the power of healing, but this aspect has become quite clouded in the Diaspora in general and Nana Buluku did not make it across to the legions of Quimbanda, although she does have a strong affinity with Pomba Gira Rainha da Calunga. Certainly there is the whole issue of Yoruba influence that should be discussed more fully, but such lengthy discussion of morphology fall outside the practical aims of this work. Another saint syncretised with Omolu is St. Blaise, an Armenian bishop from the fourth century who was chased away from his diocese into the wild hills. When he was finally found he had the gift of communion with beasts as well as the ability to cure in apparently magical ways. He was asked to give up his worship but he refused and was tortured to death, his flesh ripped off with sharp metal tools before he was finally decapitated. This is the legend of Omolu as understood as the Boneherd, the master of the cemetery. One can un-derstand from this that Omolu is the gate to many mysteries concerning the transition from life to death, pain and its enlightenment as well as the price paid for being resolute.

Ashtaroth in Quimbanda is seen as a composite of the King and the Queen, a merging between Exu das Duas Cabeças and Klepoth. This couple is stern and they are called upon when grave difficulty is experienced, or they arrive in giras and communions to point out errors, usually in quite denigrating and un-pleasant ways.

Any road can be closed or opened with the aid of this Exu. This Exu is a gentle spirit, very similar to Lucifer in his ways, and dominates the more aristocratic Exus. We meet him in Lemegeton as an infernal duke, and thus he is ascribed to Venus. He is said to be a beautiful angel riding a dragon and commanding vipers. Some sources claim that he is origi-nally a Syrian god, probably because of the connection with Ashtor or Astarte, Venus, or Ishtar. In the Bible she is referred to as a deity wor-shipped by the Zidonians (Phoenicians). Associated with fertility, she could belong to the Moon, but other factors indicate that she is more connected to Venus. There are many transformative powers found in this royal Exu, who in spite of his aristocratic manners has a most vio-lent temper, not to mention that this Exu is dual-sexed. Ashtaroth, like the King of the Seven Crossroads, will reveal all things past, present and future, and can teach any natural science.This Exu can also be used in works of clairvoyance and revelation. He is a teacher amongst the Exus. He is also an Exu of amorous affairs and can solve difficulties in any kind of relationship.

It is this Exu that gave the spirits of Quimbanda the task of guarding the streets and crossroads of power. This intensely sup-portive and helpful spirit lives in the streets and crossroads of urban and rural areas alike. The street is conceived of as the rural river, the point of access to the mundane world from the world of spirit. Tranca Ruas is a well-tempered spirit with an immense knowledge, and it is possible to work to establish a contact with him for gaining his favour as a guiding spirit. Since crossroads and streets are everywhere, we will find that this Exu is related to all lines or sites of power in important ways, especially in the line that represents the last crossroads of human life, the Line of the Souls. He is also placed at important junctures in the Line of the Forest and Weeds. He is deeply related to the powers of the waters, especially the Ocean, as well as the gypsies and the line of Harp or Hell. He is related to the Moon, Stars and the Arte Infernal.

This Exu is infinitely wise and comforting. Whenever you are at a funeral and feel sudden rushes of compassion, the easing of pangs of grief, or the presence of the departed one, this marks the presence of Exu das Almas. He is also an Exu that is present when corpses are washed and prepared for the journey to the other side. This Exu loves water, white and the number nine. An effective working when one seeks to ease passing, or to facilitate communication is to make a circle of nine white candles on the mound shortly after the funeral. In the centre you will place a piece of black cloth on which his ponto has been drawn with white pemba. On this give an offering of water, bread and a cigar, then ask him for solace and to open the doors of communication. This being done, be attentive as you softly sing his ponto.

He is often accompanied by a Pomba Gira. He is also good to use for divi-nation and has a great understanding and compassion for human misery. He is however quite stern and demanding of his mediums and is a more rash energy, often identified as an Ogun-like fire. As such it is important to be diligent when he is worked as he has a reputation for being punitive if details are overlooked. He is said to be of a black hue and has unpleasant features, but is gentlemanly in all his ways. He is a womanizer and a great mediator between the various kingdoms of power. He can be applied effectively in works concerning relationships, either clandestine ones, or for those suffering from problems or exter-nal abuse and oppression. This is perhaps connected to a legend which tells that Tiriri had an incarnation in Ireland, where he seduced the daughter of a wealthy man, who despised him as a womaniser and made sure that he suffered for conquering his daughter. All kinds of torture were inflicted upon the handsome womaniser until he finally died from the abuse. Accordingly, he can be used with great efficiency in works of destruction, especially in cases of abuse. In powerful workings he often brings with him his ally Exu Tranca Ruas, especially workings for bringing ruin to the lives of people. It is also important to point out that this Exu may find its origin in Oyo state, Nigeria, given the promi-nence of this Exu in traditional houses of Orixa worship in Bahia with roots in Oyo state. His name might also be from Tupi Guarani where the name refers to a bird that makes noise, a bird of the marshes. Others say it is a reference to the violently invasive weed known as tiririca, or goat’s beard (Cyperus rotundus) with its razor-sharp leaves. This weed can be shaped into brushes and used for calling upon Exu Tiriri.Exu Tiriri is a carefree and gentle spirit, who usually manifests calm-ly but with the temperament of a warrior; he is one of the most forceful and enigmatic protectors amongst the legions of Hell.

He is depicted as a gentleman with a dark blue cape, always in good humour and high spirits. He is polite and well spoken, a genius in languages and linguistics. He is also a powerful protector of women, especially against male hostility. This connection stems from his relationship with Pomba Gira Rainha da Calunga, a solemn and powerful Queen of mature age that Exu Veludo protects with great vig-our, as well as the legions of nymph-like vampires under her command.Several legends say that this Exu came from the Orient and spoke Swa-hili.

This Exu has the power to cause incurable illness and insanity in those we make the target of his workings. He is an aristocratic and wise spirit, one of the older Exus. The stories repeat-edly state that he was burned, like St. Cyprian, and his presence often comes with the smell of burnt flesh or sulphur. The many legends al-ternate between speaking of him being condemned for witchcraft and sorcery or alchemy; commonly he is considered a master of both arts. He is intimately related to the power of prayer. Workings with him involve bats and domestic animals, like dogs, cats, pigs and so forth. He is amongst the more powerful and intelligent of the sorcerous spirits of Quimbanda. He works in the kingdom of Calunga and the Crossroads and also works in the kingdom of Souls where he takes care of the souls of those who committed suicide. Exu Morcego is also said to play a part in the equilibrium of the cosmos. In order to work with this Exu, one uses black candles for malefic workings and red candles for benevolent workings. He gives and takes with equal ease. He is fond of absinthe, any kind of tobacco, wine and whiskey. Some say that Count Dracula, as immortalised by Bram Stoker, was a manifestation of this Exu, or at least he was the force which inspired Stoker.

He is especially good in breaking down dependency on drugs and alcohol. He is of course an effective spirit to use in workings for countering any form of vampirism.

He resides at the sides of highways and main roads where he is found accompanied by children that are prone to cause discord and mischief. In Umbanda he is related to the mysteries of the eres and Ibeji, children and twins responsible for move-ment in creation by virtue of their chaotic transformative quality. He can be found residing close to the shrines of Cosmas and Damian, and some say these powers are identical.This Exu is a legion by himself, as he interacts with all kingdoms and Exus as their childish mirror.

However, since he has the temperament of a child he can easily behave obnoxiously and likes to play pranks.

The Cruzeiro refers to the central cross in the cemetery, where Omolu dwells, but it has also become a refer-ence to the act of crossing from one state to another or from one place to another. As such this kingdom ensures the transition from bad to good and vice versa. It is the kingdom of transformation in all forms and is particularly active in liminal states, whether an eclipse or twi-light, whether in nature or in one’s life. Hence the idea of the cross also means a turning point, and a place for decision and chance. The king of this kingdom is close to Exu Veludo, given the protective sup-port he gives to the Queen of the Cruzeiro who is at times identified as the same as Pomba Gira Rainha da Calunga. This is not so, they are sisters yet distinct, even if they come down in very much similar ways, that is, sudden, stern and direct. Theirs is the solemnity of active grave mounds.

As the name indicates he can block everything, good or bad. He is a spirit which is indifferent to morals and ethics and takes special delight in eruptive sexual behaviour and orgies. It is said that one of his incar-nations was as the Marquis de Sade, and that his first incarnation on Earth was as a devotee of Dionysus. He can be used in workings where a stillness of mind or situation is needed, and he is effective in work-ings where lawsuits are concerned as he is reputed to make any charge against good people disappear in the machinery of the justice system, especially in cases of serious charges. There is a particular sexual ar-cana tied to this Exu that involves the use of intoxication and orgy to accomplish one’s goals. The working involves submission of one par-ticipant who is used as a scapegoat for what one needs to lock down. In this process the person accepting this role will be restrained physi-cally as the Exu is called into the vessel of flesh. The vessel is then fed champagne, hot herbs and cachaça upon the flesh as it is from here Exu will feed. The spirit presence is expelled by sea salt and water. The procedure is radical and passions must at all times be kept in control by the Tatá and those attending the working.

It is common in Umbanda and Quimbanda to hear the expression that one has Exu or Pomba Gira walking in front of a person. This means that this spiritual energy is clouding the vision people have of you and the response of the world becomes wicked. This Exu often has a hand in such situations, especially if they lead to situations of an erotic na-ture.

The tree itself can be used as an object of adoration and one’s work can be done at its foot. In many things his preference is the same as that of Marabô. His ability to cure is seen by some as greater even than that of Marabô, due to his fierce temperament and ruthless defence of his worshippers. However, the similarities between Exu Mangueira and Exu Marabô are so great that one can easily confuse one with the other. Mangueira tends to be less eloquent than Marabô and we should turn to his daimonic correspond-ence to draw the distinction between these two Exus more sharply. Agalierap is a demon-king of Hebrew origin and we find him men-tioned in Le Véritable Dragon Rouge as an important servant of Lucifer, commander of the second Hell and a spirit who gives knowledge across time, revealing that which is hidden. He is good for works where you desire to sow discord amongst men and he knows the virtues of plants and minerals.

He is also the Chief of the lines of Exus known as Mossorubi. He is a black man, crowned with feathers and pierced through his lips, nose and ears with heavy rings. His specialty is provoking mental disorders. He can also arrive accom-panied by Exu Ganga/Exu Mulambo, suggesting a common African origin by virtue of both being Ganga that is sorcerer and healer. His distinctively Indian features are more the consequence of adopting their arts than being an Indian himself. As such, this Exu represents the meeting point between the indigenous practices of Brazil and the arts of the African witches in such practices as catimbó and the cult of Caboclo. We find in the genuine cults dedicated to Caboclos in Brazil that people of different nations upon their merging with the cult are considered Caboclos and encantados. Exu Kaminaloá represents this kind of mystery and is clearly a power that can open new avenues in what seems fixed. He is a constant reminder that nothing is carved in stone when it comes to Quimbanda. He is usually found in the cem-etery and the woods but is a spirit that likes to manifest in uncommon environments and can be as equally worked in the forest as in the cem-etery.

At midnight go to the cemetery, do not enter but lurk somewhere quiet near its walls. Ask license of the spirit to work there and spread the black cloth on the ground.

It is said that this Exu was present at the suf-ferings of Jesus Christ. Some even say that it was this Exu forcing the hand of chance to set in motion the suffering and transition of Jesus, being the spirit that inspired Judas Iscariot. Exu das Sete Cruzes pos-sesses the power of the transportation of dead bodies and it might be this Exu who took away the body of Jesus and also that of Moses when the adversary attempted to take possession of it. The spirits of his fold represent forces that can be highly disruptive, and he holds great sway over kiumbas. His kabalistic signature, which is essentially the seal of the demon Mersilde, speaks of the bitter draught that sent Socrates to his death, and bears a gravestone and seven crosses, which hint at his deeper mystery and magic. His is the work of a poisoner of soul, spirit and body. When this Exu comes down in giras it is often to make cor-rections and it is important to pay attention to all he says, because he does not repeat himself and important counsel is usually given in be-tween distractions and observations that at the time seem odd.

The usual pattern is that the victim falls into a deep depression; all of his or her instabilities and bad behaviours are reflected within their soul. This will in many cases lead to suicide or withdrawal into isolation from the world of men, often because of some dreadful accident that it precipi-tates.

His mysteries are vast, and he can be taken on as a teacher of the Art of Exu given his enormous knowledge of the cult. He is usually placated to open doors, opportunities and closed roads, but his mystery is shared with Exu das Sete Gargalhadas. There is a stellar mystery at his root, as he is related to the constellation of the Pleiades and is the sum total of the seven planets amongst the Exus. Naturally, this Exu can be quite aloof and enigmatic, and is always a softly spoken gentleman. He is a teaching spirit and the doors he prefers to open are the doors of the soul and perception.

He is well versed in all kinds of magic and was said to be the tutor of the Antiochian priest St. Cyprian, who was reputed to have converted to the Church in order to carry on with his dark practices without disturbance.

Later he received news that she had given birth to his son and he took her back, regretting his unjust acts. The child died and so they tried again. Another child was born, who also died – and so did she. This was a devastating blow for the repentant nobleman and he become, like Faust, haunted by a dark shadow that was slowly killing him and upon death he became an Exu full of regret, but also charity. Other legends tell that he was a priest and mirror those of St. Cyprian which has lead to a thorough identification with this Exu and the Saint of Necromancers.This Exu is a gentleman, and he is serious in all his dealings. He is depicted with one goat foot and one human foot, denoting his position on the threshold between the worlds. He is said to have eyes of fire and to inspire fear in people when he comes down. His form fits very well with the idea of Satanas and he can bestow the powers of hygromanteia and astral magic.Midnight Exu has seven legions with their generals under his com-mand, ending with Exu Curadôr. This speaks of his excellence in heal-ing and alchemy, but the knowledge of divination, tarot, the mysteries of Kabala and astrological magic are also a part of his domain. One can say that Midnight Exu is the spirit who today moves people with an inclination toward medieval magic. The fruits of his inspiration can be seen in the works of Eliphas Lévi and how the ideas of high magic influenced Quimbanda.The deepest part of his mystery is related to the death of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the exact moment on the Holy Friday when Jesus gave up his breath and the veil in the temple was rent asunder. In this instant Midnight Exu assumed his power and from this were estab-lished the 40 days of Lent when the spirits of Quimbanda are free to roam the world.

As Exu Calunga, he is first and foremost an Exu of the Cemetery and his place amongst the hierarchies as the bridge between the greater chiefs and the lesser chiefs indicates his liminal domain, as well as the importance of the underworld and realm of earth elementals amongst the Exus. Calunga sometimes appears as a dwarf-like creature, which explains the name Gnomo. His relation to the depths of the Ocean links him with the powers of mermaids and sirens, and sailors who died at sea and have entered his legions. The depths of the ocean represent mystery and secrecy, and in the case of Calunga they are intertwined with death. Exu Calunga is mostly used in works dealing with dead sailors and spirits of the ocean, both in works of great healing and to create emotional disturbance in the vic-tims of his rage. He is also found within the earth of the cemetery and is thus the mysterious axis that connects those who died at sea with the kingdom of Omolu.There is more to this mystery, some of which I have discussed in Pomba Gira and the Quimbanda of Mbùmba N�ila where the relationships between Exu Calunga, Syrach and Scirlin are related to Klepoth and Venus in the form of Pomba Gira. If we continue on this avenue we will see that Syrach, or rather A’arab Zaraq, is the Archduke of the Venusion order of Shades and husks (klepoths) with Ashtaroth being perhaps the most noteworthy in the ranks. A’arab Zaraq is commonly translated as Ravens of Dispersion and is born from a volcano pregnant with fire. It we superimpose this imagery upon Exu Calunga, we see a volcano erupting in the depths of the ancestral waters releasing memory and elementals, spirits and forms, that brings heat to our blood and emotions, which constantly threaten with the powers of fear and dispersion. A’arab Zaraq is found stirring the darker strains in the sephirah and makes beauty and passion run out of control. As such it is a particular fire, the fire from the heart, whose mystical power is seen burning in the Lord crucified. The heart of Christ in flames and thorns is a most proper sign for the particular quality of Exu Calunga.

He defeats all adversaries. It is this Exu who presides over the vigil the Quimbandeiro does in the Calunga and is accordingly a vehicle for an important power that needs to be transmitted to the Tatá to gain the license to work with these spirits. He manifests in the sense of fear and watchfulness of the cemetery after midnight. He is always symbolised by skulls, candles and tridents. Whenever work is done in the cemetery, you need to pay him due respect. This is often done by lighting a black candle on the third grave on the left side of the cemetery. Knock three times on the grave and place the candle, then ask him license to use his kingdom. He su-pervises the ascent of spirits and souls at the cemetery and thus serves a crucial function in the kingdom of Exu.

It is said he was a good person, a clever and strategic warrior, popular in his district. He was, how-ever, in love with a girl whose father was reluctant to give his daughter to a soldier and demanded that he should acquire wealth and prestige before being given her hand. He started to work his way up and after many years, he owned half the district and was a politician of renown. However, he had a brother, a sinister and sly creature who happened to be a good friend of the girl’s father, and the night before Proclus was going to ask for the girl’s hand his brother bought the girl. Proclus was greatly saddened, whilst the girl accepted her fate. Shortly after-wards, enemy nations attacked the little city at the Nile River, raped the women, and killed the children. They burned Proclus and many of his loyal comrades. Some say that the 49 men who were burned in this attack formed the basis of the 49 legions of Quimbanda. However, the pain of fire was nothing compared to the pain of betrayal by his brother and so he transcended to the ranks of an Exu. He is said to be an extremely loyal Exu, almost to the point of obsession, and is equally reputed to be ruthlessly unforgiving if crossed. He is depicted in a black cape and skullfaced. He is referred to as a Tatá, meaning that he is an expert in the art of Quimbanda and the mysteries of the soul and cem-etery. He is said to be an ambivalent spirit with a quite sadistic side to him, inspiring people to commit crimes and murder. He is also reputed to control drugs and narcotic substances, usually using them towards malefic ends. He provokes dreams of death and can inspire the ruin of man by haunting him in dreams and stoking his desire for drugs. He is a merciless spirit and bonds with him are very difficult to undo. In works of treason and betrayal he is a very eager and efficient spirit to ally with. He likes whiskey, absinthe, dry wine and fine tobacco. He is also said to grab the horse from the earth meaning that the medium will experience a vortex of energy rising from the earth and taking hold, which often forces them to lie prostrate on the ground.

A simple trick to invite him to partake in a business meeting is to draw his ponto under two bottles of cognac. One of the bottles is brought to the meeting to be enjoyed be-tween those involved, the other one is left upon a red silk cloth, tied in black silk ribbons flanked by three red, three black and one dark blue candle.

Upon gaining his freedom he became involved in macumba and created a fusion of native sorcery and gypsy magic. The magical knowl-edge of stars, ancestors and the power of nature coupled with the magi-cal technology of Quimbanda ensured not only his freedom, but also an elevated position amongst his peers, which enabled him to return to his homeland. Upon his return to his people he was made King of the Gypsies, but he longed for beautiful Brazil and decided to bring his people to the land he missed so much, and so the gypsies came.Exu Cigano walks with Exu Veludo and also has a relationship with the mixed line of Quimbanda. His influence in Brazilian spirituality is profound, which the vast amount of gypsy spirits in Brazil testifies to, though Pomba Gira Cigana is perhaps the most well known spirit of this pedigree. We also find these mysteries as unique cults worked in-dependently of Quimbanda. The gypsy legacy of Quimbanda is strong and it is quite likely that the Queen of Quimbanda, Maria Padilha, was herself a gypsy.Exu Cigano is a personification of the sorcerous mentality of the Roma people and he is prone to clairvoyance and any form of divina-tion, but most of all works with cards. He is a tricky spirit that enjoys dance, song and hard liquor. When he is worked the atmosphere should be electric with joy.Exu Cigano has a relationship with the saint of the Roma people known as Santa Sara Kali, a Black Virgin/Madonna commonly under-stood to be a black princess. She is also said to be the Three Marias, the stars in the belt of Orion. These stars, together with the constellation of the Southern Cross, are of tremendous importance for Brazil and are the luminaries that quicken the serpent powers in these lands.Other legends tell us that Sara Kali was in truth Mary Magdalena.

Many are the stories about his life and many are the myths. It is through this Exu that Quimbanda reveals its strongest connection with Catimbó. It is widely accepted that Zé Pelin-tra/José dos Anjos (Zé of the Angels) was born in the city of Bodocó in Pernambuco, a state steeped in the cult of Caboclos and encantados, and also Catimbó. The city Bodocó later changed its name to Exu in honor of Exu Zé Pelintra.It is said that already as a young man Zé was a street-smart boy with uncanny luck in gambling.

He didn’t stay poor long and worked himself out of this situa-tion, not only because of his luck, but because of his sharp mind and skill with knives.Another legend tells how Zé, one drunken night, ended up in a fight with a handful of policemen after killing a fellow thief. They shot him, but no bullet would enter and thus he was reputed to have a ‘closed body’ because the devil himself protected him. After this incident Zé Pelintra gained notoriety and his rise to fame began, with this his bo-hemian lifestyle continued. It is said that towards the end of his life he had no less than 20 lovers, and one of them, the gypsy Zulmira, poi-soned him in a fit of jealousy when he was in his early sixties.Zé Pelintra was very fortunate in making contacts with powerful people, leading to his education in law and medicine. This has created quite a versatile spirit. He was a devotee of St. Anthony and he never failed to partake of his procession on the 13th of June. Consequently, work with this Exu benefits from the simultaneous cultivation of St. Anthony.Exu Zé Pelintra is called upon to set things straight in houses that cultivate him, and he is noted to have quite a temper.

He is good at doing any kind of work, but has a reputation for being especially capable of bringing about death. He is also a great healer and can be called upon to assist in the healing of terminal conditions. He dresses in black and grey and his manifestations are often accompanied by the smell of rotting meat. His name shows a clear connection to Kongolese prac-tices. He is said to be a close ally of Maria Mulambo and resides within or close to garbage. He is in fact so close to Maria Mulambo that this Exu is at times called Exu Mulambo. In the kingdom of the Harp he is found at dumpsters, and especially those located in back alleys. He is an ambivalent spirit who partakes in art, dance and artistry, as well as in the trafficking of souls. He can be called upon to expel negativity and dross from workings and from complicated situations that need a solution.Sacred Items: Rotten flesh, rags, musical instruments, trident, tobacco, cachaça.Iconography: A red-hued Exu dressed in rags, holding a skull and a trident.Ponto Cantado of Exu GangaGanga lelê, Ganga lelê,Ele é Exu Ganga,Ganga lelê, Ganga lelê,Ele é Exu Ganga."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"300Pontos Riscados of Exu GangaPonto for protection.All-purpose ponto.Ponto for attack, combat and defence."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"301Ai, ai, ai,Satan has already screamed,Saravá Exú Malé, e gangá,Saravá Exú Malé,Salutations to his iron knife.Exu Malé (Sustugriel) Exu malé is said to be of a fluid constitution and manifests as a Preto Velho dressed in white, with a white beard.

This Exu lives in areas close to water, es-pecially at the point where two streams meet and flow as one. This gives a lunar cast, and it is perhaps important to look at the energies present in this Exu from the perspective of moon and waters mixing. For Umbandistas this Exu is deeply connected with the river Orixa Oxum. But he is not only the sweet and calm waters of Oxum; he is also the rivers of maelstroms and counter currents. The river carries a power, lunar by nature, and therefore is unpredictable and changeable, and this temperament is reflected in this Exu. He is the King of the fresh waters and is as such related to emotions and communications, as well as to sudden devastation. With his fine manners this gentle spirit can remind one of Exu Veludo and Exu Marabô, but he can also sud-denly change into a force of turbulence and terror. He is an expert in purifications using water, and knows the secrets of medicinal herbs and is therefore a good companion to Exu Curadôr and Exu Pimenta.

His domain is the passions, and he can envigorate or calm them. Just like a waterfall can be deadly and majestic or serene and intoxicating, so too is the nature of this Exu.

Fluids and healing baths are essential in his domain. His knowledge of physics and chemistry makes him an expert in divination based on the Tarot and is combined with astrological knowledge. We turn to this Exu to gain insight into problems and situations, and ask him for advice, especially when situations or people have drifted apart for no good reason. He is also said to be good at detecting secret manuscripts and occult texts. This Exu often shows himself as a caboclo of the ocean who some say rides on eagles and hawks at night. He is the power of obsidian and thunderstones and radically breaks down any obstruction. He is a se-rene Exu, bordering on the moral in terms of how we treat nature, so this must be part of our character when we work with this force.

He is an Exu with philosophical inclinations, who loves to speak about the creation of the world and matters pertaining to theology. We might see him as the voice of reason in Quimbanda, and thus he can be called upon to sort out difficulties and conflicts between two or more people. This is because, like the coconut itself, Exu sees both sides, both the light and the dark and focuses on uniting them. As such he is a great force to call upon to gain insight into conflicts, internal as well as ex-ternal.Sacred Items: Palm trees, beach sand, coconuts, basil, ferns.Iconography: A black Exu carrying a white veil, with a stout palm-like posture carrying a coconut and a candle along with a trident."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"324Ponto Cantado of Exu do CocoNa praia tem um coco,Tem um coco, ai um côco, ai um coco, (bis)Ele é Exu do Coco que trabalha lá na ilha,Ele é Exu do Coco o que vem pra trabalhá.

I went to my temple and I started the work with offerings to Exu Mor, Exu Dragão and Pomba Gira Rainha da Figueira do Inferno. Throughout this work these loyal friends and fiends have inspired me and opened avenues of new insight, both within me and within the world at large. I feel I have gained a renewed sense of perspective and this renewed perspective is this gift, this text given from us to you.I am quite aware that some will find this book gives away too much, and question what happened to my vow of secrecy. I understand this, but at the same time I also understand that a secret can never be told, it must be experienced to be grasped. So, yes, this book does disclose too much, but only to the faithful ones, those who with an open heart and honest soul are able to truly see beneath.This book is the product of magical writing as befits a talismanic publisher like Scarlet Imprint. The book was started with ceremonies, petitions and offerings to Exu Mor, and throughout the gestation of this text the spirits have been called upon to monitor, inspire, close and reveal, leaving me solely as their scribe in this revelation of grammar and gospel.The most profound perspectives in this journey of text and thought have been the constant attention spirit has ignited in me about mas-culinity, what is a man, a true man, this construct molded by Mars, Mercury and Saturn with sickles of fire? I have gone through stages that have matured my understanding about this complex issue, so often said to be simple. The male essence has a rich colouration, a hot blade of fumes and fire, an axis of embers the world can turn upon. I have come to realize the great variety of masculinity amongst my compan-ions. I have found that male perfection is in many ways Stoic, it is about honour and chivalry. These traits I have found in the most diverse men across cultures, social status, temperaments and Fate. I have found lack of honour to be detrimental to the cultivation of a healthy soul and to be the gateway of misery and self-hatred."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"327This book is not only a book dedicated to Exu and Quimbanda, but it is a testament celebrating the aspects of creation we understand to be masculine. There is a certain bravery to the accomplished male. This bravery can take the form of the mandrake, holly or oak, it can be the comfort of the walnut tree or the shades of the yew. It can be the up-right and erect pride of the palm tree and the majestic tenderness of the mango tree, or the venomous beauty of the aconite. I see the knight as the fulfillment of male potential. If we look at one typical oath a knight was to swear this becomes evident:To ever be a good knight and trueReverent and generousChampion of the right and the goodA knight was deemed to be worthy of this station when he had per-formed acts of selfless love, to have fought the good fight and denied lies and deception. It was demanded that the knight demonstrate strength of character and a generous readiness to be polite with all, disregarding rank and status. It was only natural that from this knighthood chivalric love took form in the Middle Ages. It was about choosing well at the crossroad and being motivated by love in harmony with the crown of the world tree.I can’t help seeing this being the mystery at the heart of Quimbanda. Pomba Gira Rainha da Figueira do Inferno is woman of seven hus-bands, these husbands are the knightly court of perfected males. They are the protectors of the wisdom of the world, which resides in woman, and in this lies the secret aspiration and grail of the knight, the accom-plished male.As such I feel this book disclosing the mystery of Exu, in the form of keys and directions, is also disclosing the mystery of manhood. So with this the book is at its end, a gift to the host of Exu and a celebration of good men constantly perfecting their nature."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"328GlossaryAlguidar: terracotta bowl.Amací: herbal bath, but originally this was a beer-based fermented herbal brew that made part of one’s baptism/initiation in the cult.Amarrar: to bind, most usually used to refer to love spells aiming towards binding one person to another.Arruanda: an alternative spelling of Luanda in Congo where many slaves were shipped out to the New World.
