(Now, where will you set this candle [automobile horn] near the can or on top of the can?) Ah would place it on top of de can, with de cover, say a small lard - a Swift lard can, or some of those kinda cans. Hoist de apple in it an ' den po ' de syrup an ' then seal. Then light these lights on top of this can. (This is all one story right from the beginning?) Dat's all how tuh draw a person [automobile horn] or contact dey mind. This is the spiritual form, an ' now de ism form. Ah will lie flat on mah back at an hour of midnight an ' ah will contact yo' by name an ' call yo '. Yo' are not with me, yo' are from me.

(One is spiritualism and one is ism. What is the difference between the two?) Spiritualism is spiritual, is contacting of a person's spirit, as ah 'fore­tole yo'. That is getting contact in with the spirit, to contact yore mind, to git chure mind with mah mind. Ism is de form of wo rk dat people use wit powders an ' roots an ' such of the like. (Do they talk about hoodoo down here or anything of that sort?) Hoodoo -Voodoo an ' hoodoo. (Is there any difference between hoodoo and voodoo?) No diff' rence as ah see it.

Yo' take an' place it in this clear glass of watah. Well, this glass of watah should be kept befo' a mirror until they bring it back or until the officers come in contact with 'em an' lock 'em up . There is a form -ah don't know whether yo ' have heard of this - it's three okras an' it's placed on a brand-new galvanized tub, an' yo' write that man or that woman's name that has committed that murder with a form of what we call dove blood. If yo' cannot git the dove blood, then yo' go tuh the slaughterhouse� contact a hot blood from a beef, an' yo' put that in a cup an' yo' write that individual's name, especially if it's a murderer.

Ah heah of 'em usin' dat by contactin' de chicken's heart. An' dey put chure name in dat chicken's heart an' dey run nine needles an' nine pins through it, if dey wanta give yo' a constantly agony.

Yo ' supposed tub make a small coffin - that 's tub ship a body away from yo' or tub bury someone's photo. Yo ' bury a picture or bury a person 's body .

Yo' told me there was something there,\" an ' ah says , \"ah got it out .\" He says , \"It 's graveyard dirt.\" He says , \"Ah knowed something was under mah bed, cause ah couldn 't rest.\" He says , \"Ah couldn't rest, ah 'd be restless at night.\" And he says , \"Mah mind - ah been putting mah hand down dere feeling that dirt, but ah couldn 't see it, you know.\" And he says , \"This is what it is .\" They mixed it with something else - it looked like a white powder. Ah got the same things right here . Ah have Follow Me - I can get Follow Me . I have Controlling - I can get Controlling . Now these companies have these things, but I never order 'em because de people - ah don't tell 'em about 'em. Ah 'm telling you something that I don't explain to mah customers because some of 'em will make me get 'em. But the company sends me all of these things. Now , I'm going to show you one little thing here that the company sends me (opening paper) [note by transcriber who hears paper unwrapped]. Now High Hat carries these things. That's a special one [list] for me to study . (You get them from this list - you can order them from this list. You can explain these things , the Oil of Charm?) That Oil of Charm is pertaining to relationship between man and wife - man and woman -it's a oil that they put on themselves . If you will read further down you will see something come along . (Lucky Candles?) Yes , those Lucky Candles are burned in the home and are for great success -you get success just the same as burning incense. (Next comes Courting Powder.) That Courting Powder, the girl sprinkles that on the sofas and places around and that brings love and companionship , especially if a girl don't know where a boy is . Sometimes these menfolks , the women they don't know where they is . They don't know just what they going to do . Sometimes they got so many girls on the string and that one girl she got her mind on him and he got his mind on several others and he don't know just what he wants . Well, he 'll make a promise, \"Ah'll be to yore home and see yo' such-and-such a time .\" Well , he seein ' somebody else dat time his mind is not settled on one - and that product there gits his mind right on one . (This Steel Dust?) Yes , that Steel Dust is to some people Steal Dust, and they steal one an­other's love -they steal from others . They use that dust when they see anybody they want. They put that powder around - that dust around - they can steal them from others . One girl got a good boy friend and she likes him all right, why"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"1078 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -another girl will use that dust and takes him away. [Steel Dust is normally used as a drawing power.] (Now the next one is Get Together Powder.) That Get Together Powder and Never Part Oil is - it all goes together. Get Together Powder and Never Part Oil, why we use it as - if my hubby is running around and he 's nasty to me and he won't stay home, or he 's a boy friend of mine and he goes away and he don't pay me so much a mind like ah would like for him to pay, why we get together and we stick together when we use that Never Part Oil and Get Together Powder. It all comes together because it is a oil and a powder. (Here 's Oil of Success. What is that?) We use that Oil of Success because we use it on our bodies - we want to be successful - sometime when we don't get as much as we want. We don't have money like we should - we want to be successful - and so we use the oil to anoint our bodies to keep off the, to ward off the bad and evil spirits that may come [to keep us from getting money]. (Five Finger Grass?) Yes , that Five Finger Grass is carried and it comes in a little box and others is mixed with it. We have the Five Finger Grass and we have Lodestone and other ingredients is in that box. We carry that Five Finger Grass for great success and good luck and also money and prosperity . (The next one if Follow Me Boys or Follow Me Girls Powder?) Yes , that's when a boy , or sometimes, say a girl is seeing - he see a girl that he really like her and somebody else like her just the same. De same way with a boy -while ah 'm explaining one , ah 'm explaining both . A girl see a boy and she wants that boy and he don't seem to pay her as much mind as she would like . She wants him to come to her all the time and he take another girl right along , and so she uses that and that brings him alone with her. That makes him follow wheresomever she goes, get him interested in her, come around her all the time . That's what you call Follow Me Girls and Follow Me Boys. They kin take that powder and lead them the same way they can do if they get yore hair or any­thing like that, or piece of yore clothes - certain parts of yore clothes they can do that. Bind it with that gPaVeyard dus t and all kind of stuff. They can have you running around this way -there ain't nothing you wanta do about it. (Here 's Controlling Powder?) That Controlling Powder when a woman's got a husband and she can't get along with him . Or a man got a wife and he can't control her - can't do anything with her -why he 'll get that powder and he'll use that on her, and why she will stay there . [Or] she 'll control him -probably sometime he won't come home , he goes off and she can't do anything with him . But when she 's controlling him and got the dominion over him , why he stays around there all the time . (The next is Passion Oil.) That Passion Oil, why we use that - that Passion Oil works like a magic - kind of a magic stuff. We use that oil on our- anoint our body with that oil and it also takes the - get the upper hand of anyone that you are dealing with - you will mostly go their way . (The next is Black Cat Ashes .) Well, the Black Cat Ashes deals with all kind of bad luck that comes around -wards off bad 1uck and hard luck and helps you to be more successful . (How do you use this Black Cat Ashes?) Well, the Black Cat Ashes is not what you'd call a ashes - it's a kind of per­fume like , it's used under de arms and behind de ears, and over de eyebrows. You see the Black Cat is on all them things [the Black Cat picture is the brand label], but it's not just all de time ashes. It may be ashes but it's made into"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -a perfume. (The next is Lucky Month Perfume .) That Lucky Month Perfume , if you were born - what month were you born in? ( I was born in February.) 1079 You were born in February. Well it's quite natural that you were born in the February perfume . You'll tell me when I write off, '�ell, ah want you to get Birth Month Perfume.\" Well, ah will send and get it for you. You can put it anywheres on you that you want and you'll be a great success. [Here is one of the earliest informants to tell me I am going to be a gPeat success ; but only if I use her perfume!] If you would use mah perfume -ah was born in January- now, if you would use my perfume , you are not going to be as nigh successful with my perfume as you will with that February perfume. And your birthstone is the same way . (Then the next in order is Triple Strength Lodestone.) That Triple Strength Lodestone is three times as strong as lodestone - as some lodestone - the triple strength is three times as strong as the other lodestone . Some is stronger than others and so when you get a triple lodestone, that's real strong -triple means three times as strong a lodestone. (The next is Adam and Eve Paradise Root.) Well , I have just explained that. On that Adam and Eve we get the Adam and Eve in Love Oil and then we get those two little things on the outside of the bottle , or we kin get it in the box without the oil. That is some of the things that I showed you on that special sheet. (Here 's Good Luck Perfume .) That Good Luck Perfume - most anybody can handle the Good Luck Perfume because it is an all-round thing. Everybody can handle that perfume . (How would you use that?) That Good Luck Perfume is uded, you know, for the best results - is used in the same way that the other perfume is used. Sometimes it is just a little bit poured in the hand and streaked over the hair, and then it is used over the eyebrows and behind the ears, and then it is used under the arms, and then it is used around the neck , and then it is used on the handkerchief. (How would they use the next one -Love Powder?) Love Powder is something that people use on them to be well thought of and you carry it and most anybody will take to you and you kin get favors of them , cause they will cater to you. See, some people , it look like everybody jest thinks something of them . Just like Follow Me Boys, you just got a whole host of 'em. (The next is Dragon's Blood Controlling Powder.) That Dragon's Blood Controlling Powder- it has a oil in it and a perfume , controls 'em. You see in houses how they -the great women get what they want . Don't you see some people getting everything they wants. I don't see sometime how a woman marry. [What some women marry puzzles her; it puzzles me , too!] She can just go out and get most anybody she wants - a man with money, because they pays great money for these things . These little things that we has here is nothing to what they pays. They pays hundreds and hundreds of dollars for these controlling things . Wheresomever she sees a man that she- you know, she can go to <his one and she can get whatever she wants, and he's a man made of money. These things , if they are enough - now these things [I sell] has a very little of _that [expensive and powerful] ingredients put in it but it's just got enough in to make people [satisfied? ]. But when it's real, when it's the very best and the very strongest at it's highest strength , people get it and they can pull your mind off anywhere they want . Look how this woman married here the other day. (What woman was that?)"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"1080 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -De wh ite woman -look how she married. (Oh ! [Who?]) Look how she married. Now these women - and look at Cleopatra. (How do you think she got married. What do you think she did?) Look at Cleopatra and you will see a lot of these things . And how she uses these great kings , and she told them what she wanted . (This Wally Simpson that got married - wh at do you think she did?) Well, it could - she could have been - not used anything - may have been her luck . As I say, these great women when they get these great men, like she got that man , they more or less use things and especially they use the finest per­fumes and they kin get anybody they want and they can get any kind of money they want - they can go anywhere they want and get all kinds of money because they are [what?]. (Now the next is Never Part Oil. How do they use that?) Well, that Never Part Oil is used - you put that oil behind the ears. You put that oil underneath yore arm because it is perfume . And that oil is used on the hair - jest a little on the hair, that Never Part Oil. And that oil is used in the palm of the hand . And then when it is used in the palm of the hand , then they always put the hand on that one that they never want to part from. They use that oil on them but they don't know it - they never know they use that oil on them . But they use them powders on them and they never know. They just sprinkle a little bit of that powder in their hands and they 'll put their hands on the mouth - that's the hand and they got them right there. (The next on the list is that Van Van Oil.) That Van Van Oil is used to - in the same way as controlling - is the same as that Controlling Powder - and Van Van Oil all together. (The next on the list is Egyptian Love Powder.) The Egyptian Love Powder is kind of like Easy Life . This Easy Life you get along good - you get wh at you want - that comes in the money part. It's Egyptian Love Powder and then it's Egyptian Perfume and then it's Easy Life . (The next is Spanish Love Drops.) The Spanish Love Drops is a perfume . It comes in a little square-neck bottle called the Spanish Love Drops, kind of like something like this [a different perfume] . [She shows me the bottle and I comment .] (The perfume bottle of Lucky Perfume Drops - made by the Curio Products of Memphis , Tennessee, with a black cat on it and a four-leaf clover and a horse­shoe , swastika and something like a staff [not a caduceus - probably Moses ' rod] .) Yes . (The next one is Get Away Powder.) If there is anyone that you don't like and you think they are doing you harm and you don't like them , you want to get rid of them - why that's especially if some lady has - if she has got a husband and she is mean enough to run him away from her, why she uses it in her bed at night and she use it on his bosom. She 'll rub it on his bosom and he'll get away from her - finally he 'll drift away. That's that Get Away Powder. An ' ah told them that's something ah don't order. • '-----zY\"ou don't order that powder?) Ah don't order that powder because ah says , ·�ow, ah orders it on these con­ditions .\" Ah say, \"If you got a husband ,\" ah sa-;;-; \"ah do not order it for him.\" Ah say, \"But now if you got something like a boy friend or friend you want to get rid of, if you think he is going to do you harm,\" ah says , \"ah ' 11 order it for"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -1081 yo ' ; but if you got a husband and I know dat' s yore husband,\" ah says , \"I do not order it for you, cause I don't separate man and wife.\" (The next powder on the list is Easy Life Powder.)

You are really lucky and successful in getting holt of things -just like de High John de Conker, de High John de Conkers helps you to get holt of money. Everything come kind of easy to you. You don't have to sweat and work hard for it and go out and look for a job and then when you get it you get nothing out of it.

[She and I are talking on Saturday, March 12, 1938, in the Patterson Hotel, a Negro hotel, New Orleans , Louisiana.] I dreamt I was going into a church and when I got to the church, the woman said to me, she says, \"Oh,\" she says, \"turn around, you oughtn't to have on a dress like this\" she says, \"cause the priest -that man going to see that dress stained in the back.\" Ah says, \"Well, I ain't got no clothes here.\" She say, \"Well, let me go in the dressing room.\" And she took a dress and she put it on me and she said, \"I'm putting this pure black dress on you - this gown on you, cause,\" she say, \"you' r born to be a smart woman but I'm putting this on you because the next time you'r - this stain come on you, it's dark and you can't tell the diff' rence, and it won 't make you ashamed when men in the company.\" And I say, \"Well, there ain't no men [in the church].\" And she say, \"Well, there he is over there, you've got to go before him.\" And that was you. (Now, you say, that was a priest?) He looked like a priest. (I see. Well, do I look like a priest?) You -you ah -you represents a very nice man - a priest. (I mean -do I look like a priest?) • Yes, sir -you have the appearance of a priest. (I see - all right .) [At the end of her interview I will discuss this unusual experience.] Uh huh - and then after she told me. (Do you mean now or in that dream?) In my dream and now. (Oh , now - I see.)"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"1096 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -I dreamt that in December. (Last December?) Yes, sir - last December gone. (That's a very, very interesting dream.) Yes , sir . (Very interesting dream. I'm glad you told it to me.) (That soiled dress. What did that mean?) When she took this dress off me and she put this black on me, she says , \"Put on this ,\" she says , \"because when you go in the large company and turn on around, they'll see the spots on your dress\" - just like that. I says , \"Yes , I'm so glad.\" And I says , \"Whoever is to take this dress to wash it?\" She says , \"Oh,\" she says , \"I'm going to take all this stuff away from you and you' 11 be always in the clear.\" And she took the bundle, carr'd it away . (Well, now, after talking to me, you'll always be in the clear - then.) Amen. [Those of you who have read the INTRODUCTION know why I found her dream very interesting. First, I was at the time and still am a priest in good standing of the Episcopal Church . Second, since I never wore clericals while collecting folklore - from the time I left New York City until I returned there - neither my informant nor my contact people could have known about my official position in a Church . Third, two years before becoming the priest of her dream, I had been seen as a spirit of some sort in the dream of a man at Princess Anne , Md. I had appeared to tell him where he could find a treasure. (For the importance of dreams in treasure-hunting , see 418, p.l25.) I did show him treasure - I made him my contact man for the town.] [Just as I accepted the man's challenge to show him the treasure, so I now accept the woman's challenge to be a priest by giving her absolution: After talkin g to me, you'll always be in the clear. But notice , it is a provisional absolution in unliturgical terms , because she had neither sought forgiveness nor considered it nece ssary. The preceding two decisions are not clever - they are practical, on-the-spot judgments that a fieldworker constantly makes. I discuss this many-sided problem in the INTRODUCTION .] [This dream has two important elements - a man and a non-black soiled dress, and a priest and a pure black gown . I am both men -one soiled, one pure. In­formant had suddenly found herself in church . Why? She wanted a yes or no answer to a serious problem. As a doctor or ho ly person herself , what place could be more proper to divine for the unequivocal answer - yes or no . She her­self may have been the mo ther of a church. An unknown woman approached to crit­icize the stained dress and to put on her a pure black dress -the word changed to gown. This mysterious woman was her disguised self performing the divination; rejecting the non-black soiled dress and choosing the liturgical black gown. The answer was yes.] [How do I know she accepted the pure black gown as yes? Listen. \"Some of 'em be - have a black gown ••• just on the order of a priest\" (p. 772, line 45f.; also p. 778, line 32) . \"He would put on black, even have black gloves an' all. He had a black cap he put on\" (in title of GRANDSON TALKS ABOUT DOCTOR JONES, no page, not yet in t�xt) . Black, of course, also stands for the devil: \"yo' 11 see a man appear to yo' in black, in a black gown ; dat's dat man dat controls dat fo 'k of de road\" (title, p.l060) . But in hoodoo, as in much Christianity , there is little difference between devil and God. A black dress may have been the normal vestment used by my informant when performing rites for herself or for others.] [I have given in the text many examples of doctors seeing patients before they arrive . Is this woman's dream about me in the same class? One thing is certain,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -1097 she did not dream about me three months before my arrival; she dreamt about me after I arrived, surely being on one day one of the persons in the crowd waiting for me each morning. She was not the first or last person to look at me first or to practice the rite of divination to see whether it would be safe to call on me : \"to determine whether he should visit me , this elderly rootman - informant 1552 - consulted his Jack-ball. Fortunately for me the spirit of this fetish had sense enough to answer that I could be trusted\" (my introductory conunent for JACK-BALL MAN interview not yet paginated, which contains the rite). Did she make the identification during the interview? I doubt it .] [I had another difficult dream problem in the remarkable interview DOCTOR EXPLAINS AFTER HIS DEATH , p.344.] MEDICINE-SHOW MAN DE GREAT MISTAKE WIT DE PEOPLE TODAY DEY TAKE TOO LONG TUH FIND DE BLACK CAT IT DO JES ' AS WELL FO ' YO ' TUH KETCH ANY CAT AND PAINT IT BLACK WITH ANY BLACK POWDER OR SHOE POLISH GHOS 'ES IS SOME WA Y CRAZY OVAH WHISKEY ••• DAT WHISKEY IS A WITCH ' RY ANYHOW ANOTHAH FINE THING, DOC SUMTER, SOUTH CAROLINA [Informant 1357, like ZORRO later in INTERVIEWS , was a former member of a two-man medicine show .

These performers - depending on speed, sur­prise and suggestion -never stayed , could not stay long anywhere.

How daring and effective an act can be at or near the beginning of the show has already been described in 749 , p.251. To start the show in this fashion was the work of my informant , a magician. I must also in­clude here a show during which medicine was not sold , but private consultations were offered afterward -see POWER FROM BROTHER'S SKULL, p.283.

An ' yo ' do dat fo ' three times or mo ' if nec­essary but three is a-plenty. An ' a man kin go dere an ' offer to go with her. Sometime he git right to de place an' it will j es ' double up on yo ' -don't go in , can't do anything. (You mean the man would take his own sock and wipe the woman? And wh at would he do with that sock after he wiped her with it?) An' wipe de woman - his own sock. Well, he go ah ead on - de next time he use it agin. Or yo ' kin rinse de sock an ' use it as many times as yo ' wanta, but it will kill her aourage fo ' othah men . A woman kin take a piece of yore drawers - she'll make out lak it wus ole, ain't to be used- an ' she cut out a piece of cloth j es ' ab out as big as a dollah bill, an ' she soak dat thing three days an ' three nights in some of her own ahamber lye. An ' she take dat piece of cloth an ' put it right to her- ovah her private - an ' she takes a lead pencil an ' draws de shape of her private on dat same piece of cloth an ' den she take dat cloth an ' tack it to the bottom of her mattress.

Well now, dere's a new kinda way dey call dat now, a can 't deny powders; but in back days dey called it a graveyard snack. Well, in dem days to make de woman go fo' yo', yo' goes in some graveyard an ' pull de haid or foot stick - co'se haid is de best.

Yo' burn de haid an ' de foot stick an ' den yo' go into a place - it should be in de graveyard. Let it be day or night but it best tub be at night. Den yo' would bury dere something an' name it aftah dat man. Even if yo' don' know de man done de killin', why yo' call it someone. But it's so much bettah if yo' know de man.

He's de real ole Doctor Buzzard. (Was he good?) Yessur . (You say persimmon bark is very lucky?) Very lucky . If yo ' kin git 'simmon bark an ' powder it up an ' send it as a love powder anywhere ovah de worl'. In de ole days yo ' could keep mo ' peace in yore home wit dat den any othah thing of dat date - 'simmon-bark dust.

Dey 'd watch it - when it would run along, dey'd watch it. Yo ' can 't dig it any deeper den six inches, but it 's powerfully strong from de top to six inches . An' yo ' do dat to quiet rows an' fusses an ' so forth. Dat will overcome a quarrelsome family . [This is magic of the opposite - see p.359.] Now, de real part of it dat yo ' got out dat hole - see, it two foot square an' six inches deep.

An' when she 'd sweep de house, she 'd sweep it out an ' she'd become a model woman.

But yo ' do wicked triaks wit wicked fellah's bones , an ' yo' do Christian triaks wit de Christian fellah's bones . If yo ' want a man or woman tuh become meek an ' mild, why yo ' take dat bone of de meek an ' mild person, an ' when she come tuh yo ' fo ' hoodOoism work why yo ' -every time yo ' come dere yo ' rub her right hand nine times in de palm of her hand wit dat bone - of de righteous bone . An' dat change her. Fo ' instance , if a man had a lover an' he gave me a job of makin ' her a bettah woman, if she wus a har­lot - a wicked woman, a aussin' fool.

Well, yo ' take dat bone an' give dat man sdme liquid off dat thing an' he kin put it on her anyhow- dat 's three - or de wife kin do it. Jes ' 'long as yo ' anoint her wit dat Christian bone , it change her from a wicked wench . See, dose ole people couldn 't git no money to give to drug gist, an ' dey would do dose things wit dose ole things. If yo ' take a man dat chew hate, or a woman yo ' hate, or someone give yo' a job of runnin' a fellah outa town .

But ah nevah did have very much confidence in 'em. But dat's de way whut dey claim. But why ah didn't believe in dat , because I didn't do nobody wit it.

Wherevah a woman wanted tub breed - some men wants children an ' can't have none- whenevah a woman wants tub breed of dat day an' she couldn 't breed, she 'd take a turtle an' give him a real pot roast -fry him down good wit plenty gravy .

It made down in dere somepin lak a tobacco bag - it closed an' when dat turtle grease goes dere, fo' some reason , like any othah oil, it cause de mouth of it tub be open . Sometime a woman rlon't have dat , but dat turtle grease goes dere an' opens it. An' den a man goes an' discharge, why if it goes on de outside it causes tumors an ' cysteses growin ' in de stomach , because that discharge instead of goin' into dat womb, goes roun ' dere an ' goes in de body an ' cause diff ' rent diseases in de bo dy , because it's got nowhere tub git out , if it don ' go into de digestion. But dat turtle oil makes dat womb open so when dat woman - dey peculiar [not] lak a man - every certain time , even if she didn't breed, dey use dat into de digestion . (You said that womb heaves . Where does it heave? ) Every time befo' her monthly period, it heaves itself into de digestive organ an' be fresh fo' dat de next time . Dat 's why a woman is so guick to git ketched right after her period -quicker to ketch it den , den any othah time , because her womb is clean an' fresh. If it wusn't fo ' dat , her womb would become inflam­mated. (What did those old time women do to keep from getting pregnant?) Well, in de ole time whut dey used from gittin ' pregnant wus - one of de ways, an ' dey won't nevah have no mo ' -yo 'd swallow nine No . 9 shots; not one of 'em, swallow all of 'em at one time . As ah say, de mouth of a woman's womb, under­stand , is like a little five-cent tobacco bag an ' dose nine shots would go an ' drop right in dat womb, an' dat makes de bottom of de womb tight , an ' close de mouth of de womb. (How would she swallow them -through her mouth?) Yessuh . (And those shots supposed to go into her womb?) Go into de womb an' it bore de womb down an ' tightens de top of de womb.

In my original comment for the title of this interview , I wrote, \"Informant 1532, I call her, so that each reader according to awareness may in naming her express a judgment .\"] If a man is newly married an ' he wants good influence an' he wants tuh live happy within his new home an ' with his new wife, the first th ing he should do -now, it don't make no diff' rence about it being a new home, but a place where yo 've first went; dat's a new home with yo ', not no building or house. An ' when yo ' git to that place, when yo ' enter the gate, yo ' should salute it three times . Salute that home three times, then as yo' make three steps, yo ' says, \"In the Name of de Father, in de Name of de Son, in de Name of de Holy Ghost,\" an' every­thing will be well. An' yo 'll have de happ iness an' de joy of de home in that country or that town , or wherevah yo ' are an' yo 's perfectly happy. (You take three steps into the yard.) Yes . [At this point I asked whether she had ever heard anything about jumping over a broom , having in mind a belief or saying from my own book: \"I heard grandma tell, that before the Civil War they never got a license to marry. The colored folks would have to walk backwards and jump over a broom, and they were married\" (FACI, 1st ed. , 1935, No.7325, p.369; 2ed. , 1965, No . 10193, p.465) . This jumping was not a marriage but a rite to prevent evil and bring good luck to the couple.] Ah don' know 'bout jumpin' ovah de broom , but de sweetest story most evah ah heard wus about that - mah mothah wus a slave , mah mothah really wus a slave . Ah ·wus bo 'n 'way aftah mah mothah wus ole age . She said her bossman had one of de favorite colored men most evah she saw -said one that he loved well an ' thought well of. An' said he did everything in de world tuh make things happy fo' him an ' he jes' really loved him. In fac' , sh� says her bossman wus good tuh her. They nevah got no whippin's an' nuthin lak dat, but dey wus all ca'ed fo ' an' wus loved. An ' [Bossman] says , he tole him, says , \"Now listen, John.\" Say, \"Yassuh .\" Say, \"Ah want chew tuh build me a house.\" Said, \"Ah want chew tuh really build it so it will be comfortable an ' so everything will be well with it an' so yo ' kin live in it real good.

An ' so anothah ole colored man came along an ' he says , \"Well, John, is yo ' goin ' put all dat money in dat house lak dis wh ite man say?\" Say, \"Yeah.\" Says , \"Well , yo ' oughta be 'shamed.\" Says , \"Yo ' kin save some of dat money,\" says , \"don 't put dat partition in dere.\" Says , \"Jes' sham [pretend ] tub build him a house -he 'll nevah know de diff' rence .\" Says , \"Yo ' ain't goin ' live in it, neither him,\" says , \"why not save de money?\" So he went an ' sham he build de house. An ' wh en he got de house shamly built an ' wus through with it an ' put de do 's an ' locks on it, she says he came on to de house. An' he [Bossman] says , \"Well , John , is yo ' through wit de house?\" Says , \"Yessuh , Boss.\" Say , \"Have yo ' fixed it lak ah tole yo ' completely?\" \"Yessuh.\" \"Got everything yo ' need?\" \"Yessuh.\" \"An ' yo ' kin live happy in it?\" \"Yessuh.\" Says , \"Well, John,\" says , \"now , ah told yo ' ah wus goin' furnish de money tuh build it an' ah want it built good 'cause if it's not built good yo ' cain't live in it.\" Says , \"Now, yo ' got through wit de house an ' dis is de key fo ' hit,\" says , \"well, ah 'm jes' goin ' hand it back to yo '.\" Says , \"Now hit's yore house.

Here indeed was a woman in need, other­wise she would not have returned. The title quotations tell me how to build and operate a shrine. Her five saints on picture cards - which include Jesus and Guardian Angel - are nailed in a horizontal row across the chimney and somewhat ab ove the mantelpiece, so that under each can stand a candlestick with proper colored candle.

Zorro - who borrowed his professional name from the title of a motion picture well-known at the date of borrowing - speaks for himself on cylinders 467:1-474:1. \"Friday , June 11 , 1937 - Norfolk -No. 468 - Dr. Zorro -1057 Clavert [[Calvert?]] St. , Norfolk\"-Numbers Book 442-621.] One of the fellows that I m et on the road was ·telling me about chew - course it's quite natural everybody wants to know what it's all about � and invited me. Say that you wished to see or - I don't know what it was - says you was compiling a book of some description and had me to lay over to see you. And again I told him I would, and [though] I had to be at my place [of business]. (Do you do business here in Norfolk?) Yes , I do business in Norfolk . (I mean do you have your office here, live here?) Yes . (How do you spell your name?) Z-0-R-R-0. (Zorro.) I have two . I have a place in [nearby] Suffolk and I have a place here -but mostly I was in Suffolk. So, I don't know just what you are in the market for or just what. Well , it's no harm to ask. (That 's quite Light.) [After a brief explanation of my work which I did not record , I say:] (You can tell me anything that comes to your mind.) Now , I find in my dealings , a child raised in Alabama or Mississippi, or we say, the deep South , and one that is raised in de East - I do find that there are two different types of children . The child that has been raised by a whip and a scold, a ballyhood we could say, and one that has been raised by the point of the finger, we find out that there are two . We often hear the story , espe­cially amongst brutish m en , that I have to whip my girl friend or my wife every week before she will mind. After I whip her she will do this and that. Now , I find this. The girl who are raised in the deep South probably will have to be whipped - if you wants to take this one for a wife, you will have to use her just the same as she was raised, scold her. Now, the one that has been raised in the East, or the West or the North , we say, is shy by the point of the finger. In order to get her to be a real wife, that is a helpmate, why she will have to be handled the same way . These two women -wives - cannot be used [with] the same strategy. So, I do find that it's quite different into the wife. First, find out where you get your wife - where -just where and how she was raised. Then, I do find in my line, a child that it's parents is in business or his parents are buying, and one that is meeting the seven o'clock whistle -they thinks different , see . Now, the child that his father's in business or buying , he 's always around de table, that is , figuring about , he 's talking, ·�ell , honey, I� got to meet this note and so on and I'm got take dis bill out and I'm going to close this deal.\" This child grasps a portion of this and comes up easy. But the one that is always talking , \"De boss - de boss carried us like hell today , afraid I'm losing my job,\" and so on . This child, he is always thinking - he always have an idea of appeal [supplication and fear] -like you find this. Again , hoodooism. The question may be asked, ''Who was the firs t magician?\""},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"1160 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -We say - claim that Jesus was the first magician because he handed Moses de wand and Moses smoted de water when they were running from Pharoah 's army. So, magi­cians around here generally claim that they gets their mysteries from God. Again , I find out, speaking ab out de graveyard dirt , this may be very true ; but it's a simple [truth ] ab out this , that the hoodoo world depend upon p erson­ality, and also it depends on belief. They say fai th moves mountains. The average magician says - I mean hoodoo man, says that we [hoodoo men] moves trouble. The fourth beas t of the Bible states, says , \"Go and see.\" (What did it say?) The fourth beast -the first beas t says , \"Go and see,\" [the second one] , the third one , and on the fourth beast, they go and see- says , \"Don't ask him or her but go and see.\" Now, firs t I find in de hoodoo world it's no need to talk to those that don't believe , beca�se you 'll lose them. But if you do get one that don't believe , you mus t let your conscious mind deal with the subconscious mind and you must, again, refer back to the Good Book in relating to them this story that God says that in a garden there's a tree bearing twelve manners of fruit, and it's leaves was -again you find they says fai th moves mountains. Now, \"Sister, just think , you can gain anything you wish.\" First, you relate to her that the Bible says that they use holy water. You give her a package of your holy water [informant and many other professional workers make own holy water], relating to her with your faith. It's my prophesy that you will succeed. Again , there is such a thing as someone have left you - sweetheart or mother. If you will go and dust your windows down with a brush or broom every morning for nine mornings and call their name; then after that , if you will sit down and write a letter and take this letter and burn it up and throw de ashes in de mid­air, the direction where you think they are , you will hear from them or something from them, or either, they will concentrate with you. The chances are , if these people haven 't written you, they will write you or later on - it may be a year, you will receive some mail or message from this particular person . (When you brush this window down you just brush it? That's all?) Just brush your windows with a broom every morning for nine mornings. You brush your windows down for nine mornings and make dis wish, and also you got the letter. All right . Now, after burning the letter up , you will hear from them in less time than a year - what we would say within 90 days. It will take some time to hear from them. (Suppose a woman likes a man and he doesn't like her, what could she do to get him anyway?) What kin she do to get him? If a woman likes a man and he do not like her -in some cases this has something to do with a sex . I do find that in the m ost of the cases of that kind that women leaves their husbands and husbands leaves the women -these mens or women or this party , there is something wrong in their vitality . Again , there is such a thing that another wo man can take a man away in this way , which we do know that certain things which [concern] your belief. It is known that if you will burn incense and if you will use holy water and dPess yourself, as the Good Book tells us , that women would dress their bed and dPess their body aftd affection , why they can easily gain this man by using this dress­ing -this means a high-diluted perfume. Again, with this high-diluted perfume you mus t also make it your business to make him answer certain questions to you, or prove to him that you are better than the one that he left, because you have studied astrology or strahtegy of gaining him ; and quite natural, studying as­trology of gaining him, that you will again do this. You could do everything in"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -1161 your power to have everything looking sweet and you would use every action and movement in de body with this perfume. Then , again , in using these perfumes, you calls his name three or four times and you writes him if you can . Then, in writing him, the perfume that is known as Boston Compact is diluted either with alcohol - the Boston Compact is a oil diluted with alcohol or either with warm water and colored to suit the eye. And spread this on you and catch his eye . He will get devoted to you from this diluted odor. Years back they used to use Hearts PerfUme, which is the common grade of mus ' [musk] . Again , by doing the see[?], this woman use her- his wife comes to be dis­gusted and quite natural she begin to arrange it so that every time he is there he come to be disgusted till he thinks of the various times that he has been with - that's where she uses her subconscious mind with his conscious mind and that's the way she takes him in . Although there is a ole saying - it is told by a savage people that you kin take certain things from him and certain things from you. (What are these certain things?) Well, they are a little bit. (You can speak quite frankly, if you want to say it. ) These simple things . If you takes his discharge and your ministration and lengthpiece - two together - and cast them overboard, he'll never get away from you. (How do you put them together now?) You take your ministration , his discharge, before they dies - you have to work this within three or four hours after you get it . Put them in a bottle and seal it up , he'll never get away from you. Now, there's another I'll tell you, that he will never have th� designs for anyone else until you turns this on him - just turn him loose, if you wants to give him away . You gets de bottle back and turn him loose. (Have you heard, though , of a woman measuring a man?) I didn't get you- I didn't get you for that . (A woman measuring a man - measuring his .) Why this only works from this side -this is a phoney though. What they measure with's no good. The vitality - only the seed and ministration is the thing that they have to use. There's no fakes wouldn 't work . (Suppose a man loses his vitality - a woman would take his vitality away -what could he do to restore it when she puts the spell on him?) If he can coax her to turn him loose, he 'll have the feelings for others as he wants. But if she is hard-hearted and she don't let these two seeds die, why she's bottled him - he'll never get away. (Is it true that a person can get hold of your foot tracks and do something with them to harm you?) Getting hold of the foot track to harm you - in the hoodoo world they claim if I can get your foots teps that I could harm you. But, there is no sucq a thing as that. I defy any man to say that he kin take my footsteps. Just as the same as �story they tells in hoodooism that I'm going to d�ss this doorknob. Well, let's look into it. If you dresses this doorknob of [for] me and someone else come along and hits this doorknob, they gets hurt. This is a phoney that is told i� hoodoo by people that are deluded, �· But , there is such a thing that you kin d�ss this doorknob with something that carries a odor. (Well, what would that be?) Well, it a offensive odor. You kin take , people says , potash with this sul­phur, and then it's quite natural if it will touch the hands , it will take a con­fliction on it, and with his belief, why , it will practically harm 'em."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"1162 - Memoirs of Alma Egan H yatt Foundation -(It depends upon the way he believes?) Shore . (Rather than upon the mixture itself.) But, now , you kin break that up by using the stuff that is known as your night water, and with vinegar, and what is known as silver mullein. [Three ingredients .] You take your night water, about a quart, you take this silver mullein into vinegar, and put it all together and you'll wash - let it get hot, and wash de head [of penis] with it, and then tie the head up . Again it revive -it has the tendency of cutting off de old skin and putting on the new skin , it makes it work like that. (Can they get hold of your photograph and do anything with that?) The photograph question - well it 's this way . If a party gets your photo­graph , nails it up to any kind of tree and you come to know that they have nailed it up to a tree - with the propaganda that have been put out - you will come to be a fanatic [frantic] . In other words , you will worry yourself to death . (What have you heard them say they can do with graveyard dirt?) Graveyard dirt is known to bring people back and to split 'em. Now, I 'm going to throw graveyard dirt at you and you'll soon be dead. [Technically this is known as putting a bad mouth on you. ] But the real final truth about gr aveyard dirt, it 's no such thing . (It doesn't affect them that way at all.) (Well, now , what sorts of cases do you take in hand?) There are such cases as strokes and things , [also] womens and mens that can't agree . (Well, now , what can you do with them? If a man and woman can't agree , some­one has done something to them to make them disagree? Or do they just disagree?) All right. The average man, I find , the average man or woman -well, the average woman that believes in hoodboism or says someone is taking her ma�way from her is a woman that practically have lost her actions. All right, then he goes somewhere else and will find that he kin get just what he wants . But , I do find this. Set down and write a letter- write a letter just· the same as the day you first started to court. Re late into this letter the 'script ion from the Bible , says , \"Yea, I walked in the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil .\" Now, dey 'll write it just the same as if she was pleading . And after you do this , then you d�ss this letter - you �ss this letter with a high-diluted perfume such as Jockey Club or some perfume. But be sure that this perfume is used through a sachet powder. After treating this letter with this perfume, you bring the letter to me . (The woman brings the letter to you?) Shore , already addressed . After the letter has been addressed, then you brings it to me . And after you brings it to me - do not seal it, bring it to me and after I dresses this letter. And after I dresses this letter, then I puts, treats this letter with this high-diluted perfume and sachet powder, and she 'll send it to him. Then the third day , if she thinks that she kin get in de neigh­borhood where he 's at, she 'll stroll by and then he will give her some high­diluted perfume to wear it . And if 'tis necessary she has to go to work then and gets any �pensive garter - just one . (Who gets this?) I do . (Oh , you do - you get the garter.) Yes . And this garter is treated. The question will rise when they retire , where is the other garter. After the letter, she relates, \"Did you see a letter so and so.\" Now , as to the party that is staying together, the husband is not"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1163 faulty or the girl is not faulty . After perfuming them up highly , tie a rag , if it is a woman, around the head, and \"daddy comes tonight\" - dey very sick. If it is necessary dey ask, \"Why you strike yourself and have a little blood or some­thing on your hand .\" Den this question rises, \"Dear, I wanta tell you somethin', I feel like I'm not going to be here very long.\" All right, then she retires , and then she gets right down to, \"Dear, why you do in ' t this - it making me sick.\" At de meantime , you [the practitioner] prays and have her to pray off that. With all of these particulars, with your belief - if you will pray , all things you will find absolutely certain . (I didn't understand what you did with that garter. You give the garter to this woman?) Dis garter raises de question when she is getting ready to retire . One is the real garter and the other is probably a string, and then the question , where is the other garter. Then you [the woman] brings up de story, you know , how you [she] be. This is to break into, bring back de story, so we kin revive [old memories] and come to be old friends . (I see - in other words, if a man sees she is only wearing one garter, he wants to know where the other one is . That the idea?) Yes , then the question arise - where is the other garter. But this garter must be tricked. Now , this is treated by you so it is . (I see, you do with the garter the same as you did with that letter.) Yes , the same way . [His use of the word tricked as a synonym for dressed suggested my using the word in its normal sense .] (If someone thinks he 's tricked-harmed or something of that sort -just how would you go about diagnosing the case? How would you study a case of that kind? ) Well, it partly comes from the year [ear] - thinking that someone have poisoned them or put a spell on 'em. All right. We do find in the South that 90 percent of Negroes is been trained under that hoodooism and 40 percent whites believe in hoodooism. Well, they looks around backward� [afraid of their own shadows?]. All right, we find that she believes that she's hurt. First, find her age . The average woman that is past 35 -that is reaching 40 - yes , she's hurt because the Bible tells us that she 's hurt, because she should go and she would bear, have pain. At 35 she begin to change life. First, find out the first intercourse she have . After you finds out the first intercourse she have , then you kin judge . \"You ever been a mother?\" \"No.\" \"You never been a mother?\" \"No .\" [Or] \"Been a mother to two ,\" probably she will say. All right. \"Did you have good treatment?\" \"Yes.\" \"How is your husband? Is he a brutish man and use you like a horse, or do 's he respect you?\" All right, he uses you like a horse. All right. \"What line of work you been following up .\" All right, been doing domestic's work. All right. If she's been hurt -she believes she's been hurt, then you use your psychology and treat her then, just the same as the regular [doctor?] -you treat her for the oves [ovaries] the womb, the head. If she's in business of any kind, well, you know that she 's subject to have brainstorms at certain times , but if she haven 't got any money and she jus t happy-go-lucky , a�d y ou tells her the truth and she don't believe it, you have to tell her a lie . Well, all right, you go back -you goes back and show her she's hurt. She 's hurt right in her leg - has something crawling up and down her. All right. What is dis crawling up and down? This is the change of life . All right. Now , if you tell her the truth , she don't want you; if you tell her a lie, all right . All right, now we 're coming for this phoney business. When was de last time -you know de party -you calls several names , if it is necessary , as I do it in my"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"1164 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -way. First, I relates over to her, \"Yea, I walks in the valley of the shadow of death\" - this praye r. Find out de ones . ·�ow write four names of your distin­guished friends down- write two names .\" (Do you mean men she has had or just friends?) Friends - just relatives, male or female. You write four names that be your particular friends, down, and you write three names in front of your enemies . After you write 'em down, then, you don't look at 'em. \"Why did you write this top name? Was she so-and-so-and-so?\" You works from that. You might come in this way -in this mind-reading and fortune-telling business there may be a time that you don't believe in it . [You say to the woman] \"There is four people that are working opposite against you - one is of middle age , one is of business, one is a male and the other is a female. It seems that the male and the female is trying to operate together.

All right .\" \"Yes, I certainly do .\" \"Sometimes it feels like your head is going to come off, is that right? You don't have the feelings for others as you do for him, do you? Or, you has more pleasure for him than you do the others? Chance is things is not b�aking so forty with you? You don't handle the money good, do you? Seems like everything you put your hands to it's a failure? It's lots of friends don't like you? Then ask me any question you wish.\" This is for the power for her to open up and give you the - I tell you what you do then . ·�ow, let me see if it 's s'uch a thing where you kin look in a certain portion of de flesh for your misery.\" \"It 's right in here. And every time I pass by her house, she did this or that - she made faces or shook her mop . And she gits in church and slurs me and tell me, 'Yeah , dis or dat,' and tells all de neighbors that I'm going to - 'I going to get a husband that takes a real man. '\" This is the case. All right. It would be wise to tell her to write a letter and bring it to you, with these peoples names. After she do that, then you tell her to write a letter to her husband and give it to you. All right, you gives her then some incense to burn , when no one is around and to go in conference with herself, and fast [abstain from food] -\"Rub yourself down into this and tomorrow night you go out and he '11 be there.\" This is taking a chance he '11 be there , you see . She '11 say, \"Yes, he come but I didn't see him -but he come by.\" All right - this woman, you can git her through him . Now, you'll have him to come around by you, using - taking your conscious mind and dealing with his subconscious mind, and concentrate on him, he will ab so­lutely ten out of twelve come there, where she will see him . When he do come -in the meantime , you fix and dPess her and say -and give her something to rub down in . You may give her what you would say is a high-diluted vinegar - it could be white vinegar- and [say] \"Rub yourself thoroughly with this.\" Then come back and.give her what is known as a penetrating oil , and again, we would say cream of tartar. And if it 's necessary to, give her some sachets to burn on the stove . This is to fume [perfume] the house out - Lilies of the Valley Perfumes as they calls it , and you tell her again to rub down with that.

Let 's see - if a person see something - if my neighbor have had a fuss or mis­understand - a boy friend fell out - or on a job and anything that it out de ordinary that is done - or they thinks - and then a pain or something strike them or either lose their job or something happen, they believe you did it -yes . That 's with your faith - that someone is robbed joo out your job -your job is lost. [If you believe it, it is true.] (How would you handle a case of that sort? If a person said that someone did something to me - took my job away from me and they [even I am mixing up pro­nouns !] carne to you- how would you restore their confidence - or you know, how?) Well, now- \"Good morning, Madam.\" ''Yes , I was working there and they took it [job] on away.\" \"What 's her name? Did you ever see these people talking to the boss? Was she a better worker than you?\" \"Yeas . Well now, I works myself to death , I'm de fastest worker there.\" Sometime we do find out that workmen's employers - employees is got a way , especially de females sex to try to gain de affection to this [man] worker at de plant . In lots of de cases they left this work [did not lose the job] . Again, we do find out again that sometimes , that they slow up on de job -sometimes that complaints would have a lots to do. And then personal appear­ances - that smile. Then again, the old girl used to come back or something of this kind. This is the case you have to find in all these things . Probably she 's a girl that she's not so tidy , or she do not wear a smile, or she's too familiar . Then, again , we do know that low salaries will make people take . (What?) That low salaries will make 'ern take [steal] . Well, it is sometimes something like that, but never do this, if this is the case [never ask about a possible theft but] you say this to your client , ''You place this on you.\" You use this psychology, \"You dress yourself and wash down into this.\" And all this revive them by keeping theirselves sanitary , hair looking dainty, wear a smile - or, \"If you get dismissed, and if you give this letter to your mistress,\" or, \"Give this card to your mistress. I'm going to dress this card, I want you to give it to that mistress and let her read it to you.\" It's quite natural you wouldn 't send a card that would say , \"Go to hell,\" or you wouldn't give her a letter or a birthday card that say, \"Go to hell.\" You give her one dealing probably with the Bible. Then I says she do that and then I says , \"You sit down and you consult with her- approach her.\" See . Then by doing this they may take her back . (What would you give her as a rule?) Sometime you give 'em something to wear in dey shoes - a highly diluted per­fume or either a foot-pad, as you see in the store; they always have those cotton pads you put in your heels, one of those or either something to wear around her. Now for something to wear around them, you give them, if it 's necessary , a little red bag and you perfumes this bag every morning - they put something on it. When they goes in it 's quite natural dey has a delicious odor and , not only that, when th�y wears this they are thinking of their mistress and the mistress absolutely by you concentrating on them. And [while] they concentrating on the mistress, on the boss - and the boss is practically [the important one] what concentrates -and then you [they concentrate on] what you would say. You would use this con­trolling power [of psychology] by doing the things that you know wili be justi­fied to do .

If a party wished a gambling hand, all right. I do find absolutely -this is true and I defy any man that speaks of it - if he will use this psychology, he will always come out pretty good. A party wants a luaky hand-\"I can't hold no money, and everywhere I goes to gamble it looks like I just can't win.\" All right. \"What is your name? What month was you born in , the date? And I tell you what you do . You takes this.\" I always deals with -mostly some of these little churches and have small pamphlets and \"you take this and read it.\" Nat­rually , you'll read it. And then you touch yourself, \"In the Name of the Father, of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\" [He demonstrates.] (He touches himself on the forehead.) On the forehead, \"In the Name of the Father, and of the Son.\" (Then you go to the left shoulder. ) Then here. (Then to the right shoulder.) Now, when you go into this game, someone that you [have] faith in , absolutely , I know this is a fact because every time I used to get ready to go on de road -I was on de road 22 years -every time I'd go on de road, when things was break­ing bad , I would borrow it from a uncle of mine. And this uncle was one of the -he didn't call hisself Christian S cience , but he was of the Church of God in Christ. See. (Is that what they call Holy Rollers?) No , this Holy Rollers is a phoney name, but the name of 'em is Church of God in Christ. All right. Well, they believe , not as Christian Science, but dey do believe dat faith will move mountains. And I knowed he always has been a very good man - the first thing , he was nearly forty or fifty years old before he ever was married, cause .he had to care for his mother. Well , I was born in de State of Virginia. (Oh , you were born in the State . Oh , I see.) Course I've been on de road for twenty years in various attractions Shuf[lin' Sam - and I've been in the medicine game and several other. (What did you say you were in -Shuffle Along?) Yes -ah mean , not Shuffle Along - S huff lin ' Sam. (Shuffling Sam.) And also S. H. Tuttle - I played the [something] at Mobile. I played the White Star in Cleveland. I lived in Massachusetts a couple of years. I run the Southern House there [somewhere]. (How did you £ick up this work - I mean, how did you get into it?) Well, I had a friend - he was - I first come to be a magician -now , I'm ahead of my story . I had a friend that was in this work. He was known as the Myster-i­ous Pat>ker. (Mysterious what?) Parker. (Was he in Virginia here or.) Yes , he was in Virginia. (What town was he in?) He was in Norfolk . And he was not so good on reading or writing , and so I • used to hang around him and do all of his writing . In other words , I could say I was his under-cover man , at .d did all of his writing , and from that, why , he had no idea of how to conduct business. So I would outline to him, in fact, what it was all about, in the way of how to correspond and write these letters and answer 'em. Then he left me for five years . So after he left me in ' 2 5, I goes to work and I git about three or four hundred bucks and I goes into the magic business."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -1167 Then I come to be a magician . So after coming to be a magician , then I put it down and I opened up a office of the same type [as P arker's]. Of course, the law was very funny, so I opened up as , what you would say, a School of univePsal Te aching -how to make different kinds of products - and from the products why ! didn't git along so hot . So then I opened up what is known as a SpiPitual Ad­vising Office. So, therefore, from the spiPitual Advising Offi ce and from being on de road with medicine , then I gradually taken in all of this hoodoo business . So that's the way I come and I always figured that I wanted to be a little dif­_ferent from the rest. And of course, I never did believe in swindling the gen­eral public - being fair with 'em - but if you see a monkey, why , in some cases, if you are short [of money] you have to keep it . (If it is really something that isn't swindling him -if you can work on him, if you can work psychology on him , that isn't swindling him?) Yes , but owing to our faith , why , we shouldn't tolerate with this whatever, but . (Oh , it will be years before they can stop it?) I don't know - it will be thousands of years.

Kentucky, Shepherd[?] , Elizabeth City [North Carolina] . [He may have played Shepherdsville, Ky ., but population in 1960 under 2,500. I would soon collect in Elizabeth City.] What hurts this business, I believe is this. I do believe to a extent a portion of the hoodoo business is practically fair, but the average do not learn enough ab out the business of human nature or do not come in contact with enough of different nationalities in order to know a man better than he do hisself. � study, daily, is to know you when you walks in -when you said, \"Good evenin \"' [he is not referring to me] . (You want to know the type of man.) I wants to know the man . All I wants is a cheery voice, easy footsteps , and look into de face. You supposed to know de man if you dealin' with this man. Then again you supposed to know what a man is thinking ab out within the proper reach without him telling you, and I do find the average that it is in the busi­ness do not do this . [For his easy footsteps , see my comment on page 1024.] Now, what you call a good visit - when I sit down to - he says , ''What 's your practice? Are you a roadeP?

The average woman -you want it from de sex or de hoodoo end of it. (Well, both ends - just give it to me . Well, now , what do you find the average woman is troubled with?) The average woman, the domestic worker, is taking on too many sweethearts. Again , her husband is too brutish. All mens do not know how to use a woman -that's No . 1. Now , this family trouble either comes from one or tother is played out . (One or the other?) Yes - which we do know that a woman that never had a child, she has a hard time when she reaches 40 . We do know again that the man that runs around and cannot satisfy the woman - we do know that it 's no pleasure there. The average woman has to be - what they say whoopee up a half an hour before the man , they say, because it. (Before they what?) Before de man gets ready , which you do know that it takes more to revive a woman than it do a man , because they always are so far to reach . I find out that mens again , stops co 'tin' [courting] after they are married, both white and colored. If we would co 't more and as we do , if we would co 't after we are married as we do before we are married, there wouldn 't be such many divorces. Mens and womens stops co 'tin ' after they are married. This absolutely have cause of 60 percent of all de homes broke up because the woman do not go dainty after she is married; the man that used to bring in little boxes , presents - candies and so on - and he do not care to take her out to a dance or dine or wine or any - interduce her. Women absolutely loves to be interduced as , \"Mr . Jones meet de Mrs . So-and-so. This is my girl-friend.\" We do find the word wife used to be very customary , but today I find by blushing and saying , ·�eet my girl­friend , Mrs . So-and-so , my wife - and let de word \"wife\" be at de tail end . Well, this makes her feel very important and it causes her to blush and feel that you thinks a great deal of her. You finds it the same way , don't you? (Well, I think it 's good psychology . Yes , what you say is perfectly true .) Again , mens -especially our mens because they has to toil mostly - do not bathe and buy pretty things. And as far as going out and having sexual inter­course - that 's sometimes by kicking out and going to a hotel and reviving the old days over again as a girl friend , it revives his care and brings back de days of real enjoyment . (Do you find many cases where you can -what percentage of cases of that type can you bring them back together again, help them out? But you can't succeed in all of them. But do you find that you have fairly good success?) I find I has a very good success if they don't [do] listen at all, but the average woman never finish taking your treatment . You say, \"Give me thirty days and I' 11 have you and your husband back together.\" As soon as he comes back, she drops it. (He's back and she drops it -whatever you tell her to do .) Yes , she don't do it any more and she don't see him , which then you has to relate to her that, \"You know if I can do you good, I can do you harm.\" By doing that she will recuperate [cooperate] again • • Again , I do find this -that the average man and woman, as we were speaking about wives - so many of us - it 's either they do not -they stop the co' ting too soon , I mean the giving up of co 'tin ' ship and they are not affectionate. Then as soon as he comes to be in power, there is always someone in the neighborhood that admires him because he is making some dough , or he admires her because he is in de position to keep her up and he wins her over. This has the tendency again"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - C onjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1169 that one or tether will get away. Then she will say right straight -he'll come and say, \"Someone has got my wife.\" She done left him . She left because either he's not affectionate or can't do things like he used , or someone else has pro­duced him over. If this is the case, then nothing to do then , but go out and treat him in every way , or her, by giving them a verse to say, \"I walked in the valley of the shadow of death. I shall fear no evil. The Lord will be with me.\" And find out the month they was born in and at this specific time - whatever date it was - tell them to pass at [your office on] this particular date, and [or] go over to see them, or either write them with the understanding that you must wear her name in your shoe. Wear her name in your shoe - well, it's a common tPiak. It's quite natural , you'll think of her and we do know that concentrating will make them think of you. (You were speaking about a man being so brutal . In what way do you mean?) Brutal in this way . Mens - some mens realize the fact that his wife is sick. Nature is a great thing. All right, he shouldn 't touch her. Then he begins to touch her - that's No . 1. And then when he gets on , which ten minutes should be sufficient , and we would say, once a week would be sufficient , but he will want to go every night. Then he will want to try every hobbyhorse that it is - every way and every action . The womans can't say nothing -she 's tied, can't argue. Why after she's let him discharge once or twice , she's broken down. But she know that she'll have to do certain things for him . Then he begins to. And they used to have a old way , when it was the mulatto[?] woman was in action - well , this will deal with both races -calling deyself winning homes or sweetbaaks. · (What did they call them, again?) Winning homes or sweetbaaks. (Winning homes or sweetbaaks?) Yes . (What was that?) This means that I'm a better mate than the other - as a woman, it is often said, no matters what you give her, if you are not a man , it's no pleasure there. Well, you often hear the story , \"What she want wit dat man? He 's raggly , he this and that, and he come from a poor family.\" But. he has de action - he have won de home. We kin find that some womens is probably broke down, \"Anytime I wants to have a real time I has to go to So-and-so.\" The man is broke down- just tired of winning de home, that's what it's called. Mens and womens, both , don't git satisfied - after while they gets fussing and so they have outside . This is known as winning the home, or either a piebaak because she is so weak and by being weak why she don't give the proper satis­faction. Chances are he has to recuperate hisself three or four times before she kin give him anything . This means the breaking up , confusion in a home , and as we was speaking about brutish , the average man , he do not know how. He tries to go out at the bottom , to stay at de bottom, or de sides of it, which is a cul­tural rule. If you have a connection with a woman you kin find her weak spot to make - to make her bring this j oy ; but the average [man] don't find this and he's all over dis woman, butting an ' hugs , and he goes at de bottom. He 's rough and h� either is too large and he's brutish . And after he gets through, the day after, then she begin to suffer wit de whites or oves [ovaries]. Some of these - well, one thing that probably will be benefit to you. Lots of 'em never looked into it but in my traveling I have found , that the girl what is raise by de scold or de whip or is raise by a small family that has to toil every day , and one that is raised, we would say in Toledo , a place where the people is doing a little two-by-four business , they are different -they have to"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"1170 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -be handled different . I do find again that we mens should realize where his wife is from . Again - how was she raised? If a woman was raised on a farm and did not have any education or we would say, raised by a poor family where always had eight or ten children, the children were always tired. \"If you don't get out chere, I'll take something and knock the devil out of yuh -gowan out chere .\" It's not the reason that this child have to be scolded - one thing , it 's not good and proper for him that he have to labor and toil, and then it 's [some­thing?] away. This child has to be - if a man wants to make a wife happy - he have to use her the same way . Then again , I do find that every man should find the woman that is for him , The Good Book tells us that God would pick out a wife , but I find this - after the life I have been through I watches every little thing . I believe that a party born in April should marry a party born in June, I think. But I do believe if you marry within the same mont ', there 's no confusion. I have tested this. I have tested again , probably you have -a party that is named George or Tom or Henry, or say it 's John Harris or Frank- if you notice , Franks or Johnsons or Tylers, they all prakly [practically ] have the same spirit. [He mentions the celebrated FRANK HARRIS - the man I first heard about in Maryland and a year later sought for and found him near Suffolk, Virginia-see INTRODUCTION .] I will recall some of the names and probab ly you'll say the same . If you notice de name Parker, it 's always the people that has a way of earning money in a smooth way . If you notices de Howards, they's always a skinflint people - not so smart but yet they're dependent [dependable] and again they don 't take . If you notice de Jones and de Johnsons - slow to success, easy to be coaxed. I notice the Williams. They generally is slow , is steady - slow in action, they gets high , but yet they falls in life . Again, I would say I notice the word Bowles . They are very bright but yet they are not bright enough to stay on top . And then I notice Charlesons . They are the type of people that are backwards -do not care to toil but yet always stand very high. And I notice various names in life and I find that they'll run generally the same . Now , what is your name? (My name is Hyatt - it is a very rare name -Hyatt.) Well, it1s not customary here -Hyatt. (No , it's a very rare name -old English name.) Yes . And I do find that to be the truth . [If I remember correctly , Zorro is probably my only nomenologist, the only informant interested in nomenology - whatever the belief and practice of the significance of personal and family names is called.] Again I do find this . The most of the hoodooism , superstition , two-facedness , back-biters , underminers is hateful - absolutely is church people. I do find that in my walk in life. And who keeps them up -99 percent of church people. [Now , the reader knows why I neither wore clericals nor went about telling everybody I was a clergyman of the Episcopal Church .] I find, again, whether it will benefit you, but I absolutely do believe it -social and society life are the kitchens of all filth . I have test this over twenty years - society and social life are the kitchen to all filth , which you will agree tqet's right. Again, I do find in life in my traveling - even down into show-boats - whenever you hear the child says , \"I come from a darn good family , \" this child is always traveling. What I mean by that , he is always moving from place to place trying to find something else. Again, I do find that we don't have to go all day to find a man out , or who it is . You kin know whether he believes in this or that , or whether he is weak­minded, or his tongue is cheap, or whatever line he is in - if she wants to gain"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"- H oodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft -Rootwork -1171 a man confidence or come to be his friend .

Every disturbance of the self-action human body -bad luck , headache, broken arm or disease - is caused by an evil spirit someone sends into it by calling on the help of God or the devil. Only a master of spirits can rid the body of an evil spirit. Doctor Yousee , who thinks in terms of spirits, is a specialist's specialist - an expert in protection against spirits. Having described spirits elsew here , I will confine myself here to the pertinent question. How is it that a Doctor of Medicine after X-ray and operation did not find a live scorpion in the patient 's body? Doctor Yousee tells us why - the root-worker had to use a crystal ball to see the scorpion . What the crystal ball revealed was the spirit form of a scorpion . To see a spirit, one must believe in spirits. To prove this we have an actual clinical case of the young man whose company sent him to a specialist at Hillman Hospital, Birmingham, Ala. After an examination the ophthalmologist said there was nothing wrong with the eye, but still he wanted to know what had happened. The young man , one of our informants , then told him the eye had been hoodooed. \"Son , you have to go to a two-headed doctor.\" Thereupon the young man went to Madam Jane and had his perfectly well eye hoodooically healed.

We were speakin' 'bout dese dead men, yo ' see . Well, yo ' see if yo ' kin git a chance - but of co 'se it'll work if yo ' don't - but if yo' git a chance befo ' yo ' git put in [jail] , it's best to do these things. We said at de first take dis dead man's shank bone - yo ' see, take an ' trim a little of it off it an' put it in yore pocket. Well, dat's de dead man's shank bone .

Yo ' ketch a black cat. Well, de way it is yo' know, if yo ' goin' be anything in root-work, yo' gotta go by de -yo' gotta have so many followin'. Yo' gotta know whut chure doin', yo' see. Yo' can't jump at it when yo' goin' doin' somepin, 'cause if yo ' go to doin' somepin - 'cause it jis' lak a man goin ' workin' roots . \"Well, dog-gone dis proposition; ah kin he'p yo ' but ah can't he 'p mahself.\" Jis' like somepin git wrong wit yo' , ah could cure yo'.

You have to draw the circle large enough to expand - to have room enough an ' purchase enough, yo' see , to move around in, an ' when yo ' pronouncin ' de words yo' mus t turn yore face directly towards de east [demonstrates]. (And hold your hands together as if you were in prayer - just as you are doing now.) Sure . Ah 've heard that you have to go to a juniper berry tree an ' bend it - dere's apt to be a young juniper berry where yo' kin bend it ovah towards yo ', see. An ' yo' bend it ovah towards de sunrise, see, an' pronounce whatsomevah yo ' want to pronounce or call de person to do, or anything of de kind lak dat. An' take de hair of de person, tie it to de branches an' then, after yo' pronounce it for three times , then yo' let the branch wave backwards an ' forwards. Well, yo ' kin cause de person to go backwards , forwards, or either stand still where dey can't do anything but be motionless. (Do you go to that juniper tree at any particular time?) Yes , sir -before de sunrise. Well, if a person tried to work harm against chew or anything , yo ' must refer back to de Bible an ' yo' must read -first read , pronounce three times de thir­teen [13th] Psalms of David, pronounce it three times . Then yo' turn over an ' go to de 43rd Psalms an' pronounce hit three times in de mornin' befo' sunrise, an ' then yo' must say de 23rd Psalms seven times befo ' goin ' tub bed at night. Do dat fo ' three mornin 's successful [in succession] an' nobody could do yo ' any harm in no way, shape, form or - no fashion . There's things dat chew kin do . Yo ' kin write yo ' a seal fo ' protection an ' to draw or gain influence with people- to cause people to patronize yo'. An ' yo' kin even have stuff dat yo ' purchase cheaper an' sell it at yore own price by writing certain seals an ' placing it ovah de do' -yo' know, in de sealing [sill] of de do ' where it won't be protected [detected ] by people, an' all yore goin ' out an ' comin' in will be blest, an ' yo' will be successful in all yore undertakings. Yo ' kin take a woman's hair - at least anyone 's hair - cut it - three bunches from de - one from de mole [mold] of de haid an' one from de side of de temple , from each temple . That's three locks . Course if it isn't but three strands from each place, it would be jes' de same -see , yo' wouldn 't have to cut enough fo' a person to detect it. But chew kin git dat hair - course hair dat be combed from de haid is dead hair, it's no good, yo' couldn 't do anything with it, but chew has to git live yo' see an ' cut it. Take an' sew it up on de inside of yore underwear an' wear it, an' that will cause de person tub nevah leave yo ' long as de� live , regardless to how it is yo' would treat 'em or anything of de kind, dey would stick dat much closer to yo '. Take a person 's hair if it's live , anything of de kind like dat, an' take it an ' carry it an ' put it in a bird's nest an ' let de birds set on it an' every­thing , an ' it will cause a person to go crazy . Yo ' kin take a cat an' a doz -yo' know a dog hates a cat an' a cat hates a dog , yo' know dere not friendly . Yo ' kin put 'em both in front of each other -"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"1240 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -well, yo' know de bristle will go up , yo' know against each other. Well, yo' kin take a scissors an ' clip it - clip de bristles, jes' a small quantity of 'em offa de dog an ' off de cat, an' mix 'em together an' sprinkle 'em roun' in de house, an' de owner of de house can't stay dere 'less dose bristles are taken up . (That just causes confusion - everybody will move out.) That's right - everybody. Dat's to cause a person to love yuh an' to stay with yuh an ' to take advantage of dem in every way dat chew possibly can. Yo ' kin take a person's chamber lye , yo ' see , an' stop it up in a bottle an ' take it an ' bury it under yore front do' steps , but stand de bottle up on its neck. Put de stopper in tight where it won't leak out an' turn it bottomside upwards an' kiver it up . Dey will always be loving an' kind to yo' an ' stay at home. Well, a person go to dereself -yo ' know, lavatory, anything like dey go out. It's not like - yo' know we have toilets now, yo' know, to flush; but befo ' dat if a person go out to do a job or anything , dey take dat an' go to a tree, an' take a auger an' bo' yo' a hole in de tree, an' put it in de tree an' take yo' a peg an' drive it in dere tight. An' every mornin' fo ' nine mornin's go dere an ' tap it one lick, an ' de ninth mornin' dat dey tap it dey'll die, cause it will lock dere bowels an ' dere ain't nobody kin open dem. Yo' kin take a person's name - dat's to run a person away from home if yo' wanta git rid of 'em, or they treat yo' so ill yo' glad dat dey gone, [or] hurt chew or injure yo' in any way , an ' [or] to avoid trouble wit dat person or any­thing - yo' kin take dere name an ' write it on a new piece of board. Write it on a new piece of board nine times an' walk down to a running stream of water, an' take it an ' throw it ovah yore shoulder back into the running stream, an' walk right straight off an' say, \"I command thee to go, In de Name of God de Father, God de Son, and God de Holy Ghost,\" an' walk off an ' don't look back an' dat person will travel. An' dey won't give yo' any trouble. If a person got a severe cut an ' dey bleedin' an' yo ' wants to stop de blood -by callin ' dere name, jes' knowin' de name of a person an' callin' dere name, an' repeatin ' de other part dat go with it, yo' kin stop de blood regardless tub where they are. It's a [something from Ezekiel] - will -stop instantly. (What is it? Something from Ezekiel?) Yassuh , something from Izekal. Then [another method] yo' kin count from 50 back down to 1 three times an' call -pronounce a person's name at de end of each period, an ' that will stop it. (That will stop the bleeding.) Take de bow out of a man's hat an' sew it up into a new piece of bleached or unbleached cloth, an ' take it an' put it, yo' know, in certain places in de house or in dere trunk - anywhere yo' put it in or anything - say that will make 'em love yo', closer to yo'. Yo ' kin take a person's shoe an' yo' kin go to the shoe shop - yo' know, like yo ' would take a person's shoe an' go to a shoe shop . An ' it's a kind of a dust dey call tangle[oot. [Tangle[oot, before the universal use of window and door screens , used to be the trade name, a sticky paper to catch house flies.] Yes sir, an' then there 's a powder they call hot-foot powder. Well, yo' kin take it an' go to de shoe shop, or yo' kin do it yoreself - split de seams of dat shoe, understand, an' sprinkle it round in betwixt de.two soles an' den have de soles back like it was - anything [something like it was ] -an' that will run a person crazy and that will cause them to be unsuccessful. No matter how good a business they got or anything of the kind, they will go backwards instead of"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1241 forwards. An' everybody will break off from 'em, an' they all de time be balled up into confusion an' trouble regardless of dere circumstances . Take a person 's pitchure an ' that will cause 'em to molt [mold] away - pine away an ' go away to nuthin, jes' by takin' de pitchure chew know an' buryin' it on its face. At a certain time yo ' could bury dat pitchure, an ' you must write onto de pitchure whut chew want done, yo ' know, an' bury de pitchure on its face. An' you have to bury it jes ' de same as yo' would bury a person, yo ' know, dat 's daid- in de same form an ' in de same way. But chew must make de -you must make de frame [the cardboard picture] as though it was a coffin. Yo ' know how coffins are made. [The head part - slightly wider with its two corners beveled - was three-sided. The two upper corners of the picture are cut off.] An' then yo ' have to bury it an ' turn de pitchure on it's face down, an' as that pitchure fades away , they will molt away an ' go away to nuthin . (But this picture when you fix it like a coffin , you don 't put it in a box or anything . You don't fix up that coffin, you just use the form that 's all.) That 's all. As ah say, a person kin do me dat way , but if yo ' know whut to do to keep from pinin' away or goin ' away to nuthin an ' dyin', well, dere's things dat yo ' kin do to avoid dat. Befo ' day on a Friday morning, yo ' kin git up without makin' any noise or dis­turbin' anybody or anythin' an ' go to de faucet an' run yo ' a quart bottle fulla water; an ' take it, bring it an' place it in yore trunk. [Faucet water is fre­quently used as a substitute for running water.] Turn it bottomside upwards an ' put it in de right-hand corner of de trunk , an' take yo ' a piece of cloth or cotton or anything - lock de trunk an' take yo ' a piece of cotton an' stop up de hole in dey keyhole, yo ' know, an ' wear dat key in yore pocket for three days an ' dat'll vanish, dat'll kill dat dead. It wouldn't be anything to it. But a per­son don't know it -dey don 't know yo' know [where to go for help] , an' dat 's why dey have to suffer for things dat could be avoided. Git some Red DeviZ's Lye -first take yo ' a handful of salt an' sprinkle it ovah de flo', an ' go git chew some Red Devil 's Lye an ' jes' put it all ovah on de walls an ' everything, all round every corner an ' everything. An' take [it] an ' scrub dat house through an ' through an' [but first] sweep it [dirt] out de front, not de back. Dat 'll kill it - dat 'll kill anything anybody kin put down fo ' yo '. (If they have dressed the house in any way, that will kill that.) To keep a person [asleep] there's a certain thing dat she kin say, but yo' gotta understand dat well. [He did not reveal the certain thing or had forgotten it.] An' you kin speak to 'em, yo ' kin talk to 'em-yo ' kin even make dem talk in dere sleep an ' tell yo ' anything dat · chew wanta know, anything. Den yo ' kin go on about chure business an' stay gone long as yo ' want . Dey can't wake up until yo ' git back regardless of de circumstances. Course ah've heard dat people - womenfolks will take dere underwear dat dey wear next to 'em, de panties, an' hang 'em ovah de head of a man's bed an' he'll sl�p. Dey go where dey wanta an' come back. [This is probably what he wanted to say in the preceding paragraph.] (Is that true? ) Dat 's whut dey say - dey say it's true, dey says it's really true. (How would you make a person answer your letter? Do you know how it's done?) Well, dere diff' rent ways to make a person answer your letter. See , well, it's like if yo ' write a person a lettah or anything of de kind like dat, yo ' has to take de names of three ole womens dat· chew know dat died an ' write dere names down three times apiece -de dead people.

(That is - you do that before or after you write the letter?) After you write the letter. Ah 've heard tell of people opening locks - say dat no man could open . Git a green frog , yo' know, which we call dem spring frogs - de green kind not de brown ones. Yo ' take an ' kill it an ' burn 'im to a powdah. See, an ' let it stay out dere in de sun fo ' three days where it will dry , yo ' know, to a powdah. An' take it an ' put it on a piece of paper, an' go to any lock an' take an' blow dat powder in dat lock , an ' dat lock will come open. Yo ' kin take han's of a dead man- whut de ' call de deadman's hand-dat will open dat lock or dat will lock any lock an ' yo ' kin open it. But you have to take de dead man -you have to take his han ' an ' take it an ' put it in a press, an ' yo' have to press every drop of de blood out of de hand, yo ' see, an ' yo ' pulverize de flesh jes' on dat han', yo ' understand, an' den dress de han' , yo ' see, a certain way . [This is my only example of this rite.] (How would you dress that hand? Do you remember?) Well - so much ah couldn't pretend to explain it all not right now, but it's diff' rent things dat you have to use an ' everything- diff' rent kind of powdahs -dragon 's blood an ' oil of cinnamon. Well, dey takes all dat, yo ' know, to temper it an' to dFess it like yo ' wanta, an' by de burning of de dragon 's blood an' let de hand stand de fumes of de smoke, an' whilst it's doin' dat, well yo ' kin make yore wishes an ' desires of whut chew wanta do wit de deadman's hand. Yo ' under­stand. An ' af o' car it in ore ocket , it will make ou invisible to man . [The dead man's hand has now become a (Which hand do you take of that man?) De right hand. (Is there anything else that you can do with that hand?) Well, yo ' kin do most anything with it yo ' wanta do . G�veyaPd dirt is to make a person unfortunate an' everything in dere home -cause 'em to fuss an' fight an' everything like dat, but dere is sech a thing as dey call. (How would you go about getting that gpaveyaPd dirt?) Yo ' jes' go to de graveyard an ' yo ' dig down an ' git jes' as fur as yore arm will reach down in dere , an ' git de dirt an ' take it up an' go an' sprinkle it around in de yard. If yo ' can't git it in de house, sprinkle it in de yard an ' in under de steps an ' on de steps . An' it will cause jes ' afussin' - whatevah yo ' wish or desire is performin ' -dat chew must do de work whilst yo ' are think­ing about what chew wanta be done. To form- de way dey put a deadman's bone-whut people call a deadman's bone in a person, de ' go to de graveyard - least yo ' don't have to go to de graveyard if yo ' don't wanta but anyway dat yo ' kin git hold of a dead man's skull. Dey could take dat skull an ' scrape, chew know, into powdahs - a portion of it, jes ' as much as yo ' want of it or anything. Yo ' take it an ' go an ' sew it up - like yo' call yoreself a friend to a person an' ain't no friend to 'em or anything , or if dey have a friend an ' yo 's a friend to dat person's friend. Well dat's de way dat people git to you. Your enemy can't do you any harm, but chure closest frien� is de one whut do yo ' de harm, yo ' see. An' yo ' git 'em -put it in yore mattress or in yore pillah or anything where dere dust or anything. Yo ' know dat dust will extend yo ' know an' go into yore nostrils. When you sleep at night yo ' inhale it an' everything an' dat will form whut de ' call de dead man's bone in yo ' - it be 's ri ght in yore bosom. I seed a fellah in dat shape.

Dat's whut chew call de dead man 's bone. De onliest way dat a person could git eased is takin ' somepin an ' bindin ' 'em real tight right round de chest where dey kin git breath like dey supposed to. Otherwise, dey 'd be in a sufferin ' condition continually. An ' dey kin {ix it in sech a way for it to last fo' so many years, jes ' fo' yo ' to suffer, yo under­stand, until dat length of time is out - den yo 'll die. But chew kin do away with it - dere's a way to cure it. (H ow would you cure a case like that?) Well, yo' have to wear de seal -place it on de person . Den yo ' kin take whut people say -if yo ' wanta cure anything - whut people call lodestone . Yo ' kin take dat lodestone an ' break it up into small pieces an ' give it to de person to take inwardly , which an ' why it look like dey wanta kill de person in place of curin ' 'em, but it won't. Dey kin take it inwardly an ' take de seal an' wear it fo ' de length of time dat dey was �ed or fo' de length of time dat dey been in dat condition . An' if dey take dat lodestone an' swallow it jes' like dey give it to them , it will naturally cure 'im - it will run dem out - but otherwise dere ain't nuthin else dat will cure it. It's accordin' -well, if yo ' wanta do evil work or anything , yo ' have to work wit de moon when de moon an ' Mars is in cooperation together - see, because Mars represent wars an ' rumors of wars an ' storms an ' all kinds discontention an ' everything of that kind lak dat. Well, yo ' work things according to dat. Well, if yo ' wanta do good to a person or anything yo' have to work it when Jupiter is ruling in the element to do favorable things for people an ' to cause people to be successful in dere undertakings an ' things. Dere 's diff' rent signs of de Zodic [Zodiac] yo ' have to do it in , see. See , sometime yo ' have to wait until de moon git in de -go into eclipse wit de sun, yo ' know, to do great miracle things like dat . (Well, now what would you do with these signs - these twelve signs?) Well, dat always includes de celestial signs of the Zodic an ' do things ac­cording to de signs whatsomever -well, according to whatsomevah yo ' wants to do. Well, there 's several things they do. Yo ' kin take - if yo ' wanta have luck in gambling , they say dat yo ' kin win in any game dat chew git into, in card playin'. Jes ' like if yo' go huntin ' or anything of dat kind -yo ' know dese bats dey call bull bats . Well, yo' kill yo' a bull bat an ' take de heart of de bull bat . Take an ' sew it up in a red piece of silk cloth an ' tie - sew it up in a red piece of silk cloth an ' take an ' tie it right in yore arm wit a piece of silken string, an ' any game dat chew git into at cards for money, yo ' can't lose.

If yo' know how to fix de seals see , yo ' kin fix de seals for dat purpose -but [that] chew can't lose. Fore yo ' lose, yo ' jes' break off [s�op autom atically] even until yore time comes for yo ' to win. Dey use dragon 's blood for dat. Dey take dragon 's blood an ' take it an ' put it into yore incent burner an ' git chew a bottle of cinnamon oil, oil of cinna­�' drop three drop on it whilst de smoke is goin' upwards.

Yes. Well, dat's includin' - yo ' do jes' about de same way as yo ' do with de oil of cinnamon an' dragon's blood, an' yo ' take two pennies - coppers yo ' know - an ' nail one at de front do ' right in de middle of de front door, an' one at de back do ' an ' dat will draw yo ' customers hands above [number and keep the law away] . Well, dem pennies is a great work for dat part of it. (To keep the law away?) Yeah, to keep de law away . And then yo ' take salt and ahambeP lye every mornin ' befo ' sunrise, an ' take it an ' throw it out chure front an ' some out chure back [door] , an' de law will come right up to your house but he won't come in. If yo ' know how to use dat, but de thing to do to break a person up from drinking. Yo ' kin take a person who is drinking an ' yo ' kin git a sow's milk -de milk from a sow dat have pigs fo ' de first time - an ' take it an' give it to him to drink, an' he nevah will drink no more long as he live .

But chew repeat dem words three times befo ' de appearance of de jedge an' ah 'll guarantee yo ' dat de jedge can't convict chah. (What words do you repeat now?) Well dere's several diff' rent ways but let me see dis way - ah 'll try to pro­nounce it. Well, yo ' kin write it dis way. \"Ah'm to face a hard, unailin ' jedge.\" An' aftah yo ' write dat yo ' put undah dere, \"Dere were three mens looked out of a windah - one havin' no eyes , one havin' no lungs, de othah was deaf, blind and dumb . God help me in dis case, dat ah shall be dealt with ac­cordin ' to justice in cooperation with dis affair.\" An' everything will be all right. Jes ' repeat dat three times. De jedge shore won't convict yah. Well, way back - but ah know whut a man kin do dese days , if a man can git away , regardless to who he is or where he come from. A person kin kill a person an ' yo ' kin take de needle which dey sew up shroud­sea with , yo ' know, at de undertaker's shop, an ' take it an ' stick it into de tracks of dat person an ' he can't - he 'll start away but he 'll come back.

If he's got a wife, he's goin ' fight; if he's got a woman, he's goin ' fight. Pardon me , but he 's goin ' raise hell down dere, an ' he's goin ' leave - he's gotta leave , in a hurry . (Well, now in speaking of that track, you would pick up either track. That the idea?) No, no - it should be de left track. (Whether he is going or coming, either way?) No, when people want him tub leave , see; but when yo' want him tub come back it's diff' rent. (You get this left track, pick this dirt up as he is leaving?) Yes , dat's it - start at his heel.

Start at de toe an' come back, but chew don't use it dat way . (Well, let's go through the story of bringing him back.) Well, yo 'd take dat track an' yo' would want some of - a pair if yo' could git it. (Wait! Which track do you want to take , now?) Yo ' take his right -yo' have his left goin', yo' want his right comin' back. Well, now, if yo' could git ary one of his socks , a sock that he wore - see whut ah mean.

Well, now, dat would be on newspapah an' not parchment papah, an' as ah said to yo' , yo' would write his name - 'numerate it wit , \"God de Father, de Son an' de Holy Ghost.\" An' write it out wide an ' long so yo ' could apply dat dirt, an' fold it as yo' wanted it to be. See whut ah mean? Yo ' 'ply it into dat sock. Well, den yo'd take dat sock an ' yo'd put it on top of a house or on a shed, or anywhere where de sun could shine.

Take it up an' hang it by de string on de head of de bed, or de foot of de bed - it don't �ake no diff' rence - until dis papa h dry . Yo ' understand?

De sock - ah mean de sock dat yo' take wit his track - ah mean de dirt's in d� sock, an' de sock is 'plied on dis papa h, de newspapah, not de parchment papa h. (You just use the dirt, you don't use the sock?) De dirt an ' de sock, an' yo ' fold it jes ' as tight as yo' kin git it an' yo' want dat papah round it.

It has to be long hair, long strands. Yo ' take dat an' take advantage of her. Take dat an' yo' would git chew some, not black lodestone, as ah would say it. It's black lodestone, brown lodestone, an' white lodestone. Dat's whut ah 've been-­usin'. Ah've been able [unable] tuh git person'lly , white, but ah gits sim' lar, however - brown lodestone.

An' yo' take dis lodestone an' yo' pound it an' yo' have lots of small pieces of it -yo' know, small pieces , but chew wants a piece, kind of a good size piece dat's wrapped around wit dis hair, an' wrap disaway wit dis hair an' hold it perfect [demonstrates].

An' den yo' would take dat an' put it in shammy shin, shammy hide -dat thing de ladies used tuh put ovah dey face - shammy hide ah call it. Why yo'd sew dat up perfect in dere an' make a bag of it. An' take whut chew call Jockey Club Perfume an' yo'd apply all on de inside of it, an' yo' would tell her - dere's a'powdah dat is bought, dat controllin' powdahs , apply on it at dat partic'lar time an' tell her tuh put it dere , anywheres [demonstrates]. (Back of her neck.) Put it around her neck, but she'd put it in de back. (It must be dropped down her back.) Yeah. See de string would be around her neck but de back would be back dere. Dat 's de first day she wore it, an' de second day she put it heah . (In the front.) [She wears the hand about her neck - the first day hanging down her back, the second day on her breast. The real purpose of the hand is disguised from the indwelling spirit on the first day. This is my only example of a necklace hand used in the magic of disguise (see RITE OF DISGUISE, p.395) . Informant's con­fusion about sex and purpose does not invalidate the hand.] An' she continue tuh wear it even after he come home. Why she supposed tuh wear it as much as seven days befo ' she taken it off. Den she'd take it out an ' apply it into a vial an ' if she can, git a rubber stopper an' bury it at her steps where he pass in an' out ovah it.

The material fills 6 cylinders C550: 3-C555:1 = 2131-2136.] Ah git it now - that 's clear to me . Now then , ah could give yo ' mah informa­tion an' of my work. Is that right? Data of my work? What does that mean tuh me? [In our opening unrecorded conversation she had said that she was naturally gifted. ] (Yes, well. You are naturally gifted?) Naturally gifted from God, possessing five talents . Most of us have one talented persons . (What do you mean by one talented person?) Well, most all of us have - everyb ody kin do one thing. Yo ' very seldom find a person kin do more than one thing well, but there is a certain root that has the five talents - kin do mo ' than one thing well. (What are the five talents?) Well , the five talents that I pos sess is de gift of healing, the gift of dis­cern experience [gift of \"seeing\" ], de gift of winning miracles, de gift of prophesy , and \"helpers .\" (And \"helpers .\") [The gift of helping a person no matter what is wrong - by reading the cards, interpreting the mind and especially dreams , explaining heavenly signs , and by counselling . Each one of these , like cards, is a \"helper.\"] You find my work - my gifts based on the 13th Chapter of First Corinthians in the Bible. Ah wus born under very peculiar circumstances, very peculiar birth, and the seventh child of mah parents ; wus born with a veil ovah mah face and ah have mah veil now. An' I've been doin' this work since ah wus five years old. I couldn 't rememb er at that time but things I did my parents remembered and they told me , of course. Ah didn't know what ah wus doin' , I didn't know whut it was. I jes' - folks would come to my house and have my parents to have me talk to them. The farmers in selling their cattle , in selling their tobacco - they'd come to see, \"they'd go up to see that little girl first.\" Well, actually , I had to come in from play and sit down and talk to them, and tell 'em wh at ah saw - ah didn't know what ah wus doin' but they knew. [Unless the reader is familiar with chapter 13 of Corinthians I, I suggest that it be reread to understand the preceding paragraph. Also help ful would be my interview with Madam Griffith , informant 494a, who began her work as a child.] When ah got up larger I had my idea. Ah had taken some work in certain branches of psychology an ' astronomy, and then some work in black art. Well, � know both witchcraft and I know the other side , too. So that's my work. [The two preceding paragraphs contain one of the most important statements I ever recorded, because they describe succinctly and honestly how one person be­came a doctor. She took \"some work in certain branches of psychology\" - meaning one of those mail-order courses on \"salesmanship\" or \"success\" or \"personality .\" �n followed her own reading ab out \"astronomy\" (= astrology) and ''black art\" (= hoodoo books) . This sort of thing would have been useless without her nat­urally gifted and fi ve talents - and wh at she does not mention, vast experience and knowledge of her world.] (If a person left home, how would you bring them (I] back? ) [As I have said elsewhere- the language of interview. ] Ah wisht ah brought mah data along with me - but anyhow ah have [know] it .

Tie that rag on the top of that glass tight. (You take the piece of rag and fold it twice and you then cut out the center -have the exact center over the top of the glass.) Uh-hmm . All right, an' yo ' get a box of matches, new matches. Every morning between four and five a'clock -you must do it between four and five a'clock, you get up and center your mind on the individual you want to come to you. You must concentrate on that individual - nuthing else in your mind but that individual, and go take those matches and strike three of 'em one at a time , \"In the Name of the Father\" - strike it to you -\"In the Name of the Father\" and call his name -like if his name is John Brown, jes ' say, \"John,\" light them over there, \"John, I bid you to come to me,\" and drop that match while burning in that glass of water.

(That is all you have to do.) No , wait a minute. You must do this regularly -regularity counts, and your concentration. Then you go back to your room and read the 40th Psalms . It starts off by saying , \"I waited patiently for the Lord. He inclined His ear to me and heard me\" -so on and so forth. Read that prayerfully an ' carefully with your mind still on the individual. Do this for 29 mornings and before the 29th morning comes, I guarantee - money back guarantee - the individual will either write or be in your presence. And I have done proved what I've said.

You do that for nine mornings. When you get through with the sprinklin', then you take your new broom an ' you go back for ten steps and turn right around an ' not sweep the dirt -jest make strokes with the broom toward your steps , saying the same thing , \"Bring me money, bring me people, bring me prosperity, bring me luck,\" and sweep this -make those strokes on th� front steps , up the steps, on the stoop, in the place right on through. Sprinkle the place . Whatever place it is, sprinkle the whole place with some kind, any kind of perfume or toilet water - any kind, it doesn 't matter just so it's some kind of nice odor.

Any kind of perfume you want, take it, but don't rub down but rub up all over you. Put on your clothes and go to your room and sit down and concentrate and read the 27th Psalm, \"The Lord is my light and my salvation. Of whom shall I be afraid.\" It starts off like dat, and so on. Go on before the judge. You'll be dismissed. By some means get in the house or have someone do it for you - by some means. Get the dishrag and take that dishrag and smoke it over some pulverized soft sulphur, an ' bury that dishrag under your own doorstep . Why they will move and won't know why they moved. (You have to take their dishrag?) It must be their dishrag - it must be the rag they wash their dishes with. You want to know if I wanted to break up a man and wife •. I would get some of their hair - it doesn't matter how small jes ' so it their hair. Wrap it together and put it in a bottle. Fill the bottle full with my own chambeP lye and take the bottle to a running stream of water and throw it in and bid 'em good-bye in the name of the Gods. Well, she will start and the water running, they will separate. (You take some, each of their hair, and put it with your own cham beP lye.) Yes. (If someone was bothering you.) In my way and I wanted to get rid of them, I'd take their track up and sew it in a flannel rag and set down before a fire and concentrate on them - an open fire, and read the 35th Psalm.

Take the photograph - well, not the kind, not this pastebo ard kind. It must be that tin [tintype] or that celluloid, somepin like that, an ' bury it upside down -face down, and curse it. Bury it in the earth and curse it. Prick th is finger and let three drops of blood come from you on that, there, and cover it up - bury it. The person will die. Yes, the middle finger of the left hand -that big finger. What is worn next to the body can be used to control the individual. It must be _concentrated on and dressed by smoking over burned perfume [prob­ably means incense] and buried to turn their minds toward you. (If you get hold of this handwriting or letter of theirs?) Yes , that's right, smoke it over any kind of burned perfume - smoke it over that perfume and bury it. But the concentration is the main thing over it. Used for disease of diff' rent kinds. (Sage leaves? How would you do that?) Well, say, for instance, a person has this fever like we have at these sessions - fever and chills. You get the sage leaves and mix them with dog fennel, boil that together for four hours and bathe in that. That will break up any fever. That is used for gamblers only - what I know about gamblers , people who want to win at chance. If you want to win, you must possess dirt from the grave of an unsaved individual. Reach your hand down in the grave as far as you can push it, and get a handful of the dirt from their head , the head of the grave , and put it in a bag and wear it on you. You go in any game you want to and you'll break the game. Dress myself in the tea I just been telling you about - cinnamon and spices and so on. Bathe in that and rub it off in perfume. And [get] a lucky piece of lodestone that's been blest, and wear it - pin it onto my clothing next to my flesh. Have my mind centered - concentrated on the job. Just leave the bath and go straight to the employer -going to be sure in my mind I'm going to get it, get the job. --(What about lodestone?) Lodestone must be dressed by consecrated hands to be effective . If it's been dressed by consecrated hands and you wear it next to your flesh , let no one's hands touch it but yours . It's very effective. (Do you use anything on it at all?) Yes , i( you dress it. But it must be dressed every third day with some kind of perfume - be well dressed. I have cured hundreds of cases. (Of drinking?) Yes. You get a mouse - ketch a mouse alive and put the mouse in some liquor and let him die in that liquor. Unbeknown to the individual, give him ten drops of that liquor in anything he eats or drinks . It will cure any case of drinking in the world. Get a mouse with a pint of liquor. When that pint of liquor has been consumed - give ten drops three times a day - he'll hate the smell of it. Get the hair from his privates and some from his haid; take your own hair from your privates and haid. And wrap it together and sew it up . [But first] cut 'em - take the scissors and cut 'em three times. Sew it in a bag and pin 'em on you and wear it. They will follow you like a child follows its mother. First you must build his body.

That tones his body up - tones his nerves and so on and so forth. And he eats regular, he eat certain things - don't eat no pork, no sweets, no teas or coffees , an' so on and so forth. And then, every third day, you git a goose and kill the goose and ketch the blood - cut the goose head off and get the blood. In a good sized goose there's a large teacup of blood. Give him a teaspoonful of goose blood every third day in connection with his herb medicine. If he is not completely shot to pieces, he will be restored; but it can't be done in a few weeks, it can't be done in a month . It takes at least six months to restore him back. But he must cooperate with you and eat whut chew say he eat, day in and day out . Makes it as it - it'll come back if he's not completely shot to pieces . (Do you know what those seventeen herbs are - all seventeen?) Yes sir.

[The preceding ark-root, if this is the correct spelling, sounds like a hoodoo root - like ark-wood I have elsewhere. Pipe root could be pipe wood - providing bowls for pipes - a white-flowered shrub (Leuaothoe populifolia) of the southern states of U.S.A. FUzzy britahes I do not know. Tea mullein is the common or great mullein.] Powders - spoonful of sulphur, a tablespoonful - tablespoonful of pulverized powders, sprinkle all around and you sweep that up , through my house. Sweep that up to the door, and then sweep back halfway; take it up and put it in the fire. She'll stand empty for a while. (That will fuss up the landlord so that she can't rent that room.) Candles is quite significant in all this concentration work - candles are quite significant, in burning them- and think as you do [burn them] . They just aid in concentration, for they give yellow soft light and they aid much in con­centration. [While my machine was turned off, I must have asked a question about the recovery of a stolen article.] Well, now, there's where my work comes in.

What do people around here usually call that kind of work when they are trying to harm you all the time? What do they call it?) Oh - call it cunjure. (Do any of them call it witchcraft?) Well, ah nevah hear it by such a name, but that's what it is. But we call it cunjuring. (Hoodoo and .) Yeah - that's it, hoodoo. If I wanted to put someone in bed sick, make them sick, I would get a package of needles - goldeyed needles, and place them one by one head first in a bottle and I would pour in the bottle turpentine and my own ahamber lye.

That is what I would do if I wanted to put someone sick in bed - and it might kill them. (That would do the work?) Oh , yes - hasn't failed yet. Any kind of nail, if you want, say, to bring some bad luck to a person . If you can git in their room where they sleep , you take nails. Take six and put them in the wall right around [demonstrates].

Be sure that he's dead [before you take him off] . ·�at do these people usually come to you for? What is the biggest part of your work?) Well, as a rule, it's to bring peace and to bring their husbands and their wives back. A man will want his sweetheart to stop running around; a woman want her man to stop running around and bring his money home . Cure drunkedness - make peace - a give luck - get jobs - to find things - and get them out of jail - from courthouse scrapes - a little bit of everything . (Do you make handS at all? What they call hands?) Well, they call it hands. I guess so. Lotta folks call 'em hands, but I call them a little ch arm or something like that. They call 'em handS, [but I call them charms] so I'd be different. But - you couldn 't convince them diff' rent . If you want something done, you want a certain thing done, you put your mind on it and you go to the corner store - it must be on the corner - and get a lemon. Then buy - take five cents for a white han'kerchief, and pu�. the lemon in the han ' kerchief and go off by yourself, and put chure mind on what chew want done and squeeze the lemon tightly in your hand and make this wish. You do it once a day at a certain time - every day for nine days and your wish will be granted. (The man doesn't like her very much. What would you do to make him like her?) Git some of his hair or git a piece of his sweatband out of his hat and put it in a bottle, urinate on it and put it away in a dark place, make a wish on it and hold it there. Turn his mind on her sure as the world. Well, they say. Now, it's not my knowledge, but one who has done that or did do that [sold himself to the devil] told me about it - what they must do. That's what I'm telling you first-hand. Well, he came to me to see if I could help him, and I couldn 't do anything with him. He said he made a contract - jest went in and signed for hims elf for three days . [The contract was signed at the end of the third day.] And he sat and communed with Lucifer, the devil, just communed with him just like you commune with God or the spirit. And the contract was , he was to sell himself to him.

He could live jest in splendor and do anything he wanted to do ; never be bothered with debts or the law or nothing - jest go on. And said he did that but he had to specify a cer­tain time, and the least time you could give him would be ten years - ten, twenty • or thirty , like that. And he went and gave himself to him for ten years. And they said, in making that contract, they had to go out between three and four in the morning in the woods and dance with the devil. I said to him, \"What do you mean , dance with the devil?\" He go out there and - in your mind - in your mind you jest -your mind is so convinced with this spirit, they tell me - you see him -you dance with him, communicate, laugh, talk - have a good time with him, for one hour every morning"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"1276 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -for nine mornings.

You don't have to pray to nothing but to him - if you want to, when you pray, you must pray to him. You are to ask him for everything you want. You look only to him and if you think once to God, think once to Christ, then yo've broken the contract and you know what will follow - death follows. And sure enough he did have everything - he was making money hand over fist, but he couldn 't do one good thing. He came to me. He came to me jest the sixth day of October, this year, came all the way from New York down here , and he said, \"I'd give anything in the world if you would help me.\" But I couldn't do any­thing with him. I really would git a spirit for him but I couldn't do a thing about it - he was tied up . And now he wants to git away , but he can't - he can't git away to save his life . He can't do one thing good. If the radio is playing and a church program comes on , he can't - if he listen to that and enjoys it, why he's broken the contract. See, he's scared of that. Quite a sympathetic [pathetic] state. The majority [of doators ] sir, are fakes. Well, yo' see, they feel that if -\"Well, I'll git half-tight and jest bluff my way by\" - because I - I don't know of anyone that 's worth a dime, so to speak - because they are bluffers-they couldn't do a thing - and they jest stay drunk to try to bluff their way by.

If yo' jis' wanta move 'em an' yo' don't wanta do no harm or have no breakin' up or nuthin lak dat, yo' sprinkle salt an ' peppah an ' aftah three days yo' kin use vinegah by 'em, an' yo' ain't got no mo' trouble. Now if yo' can't git a black-hen aig an ' yo' still wanta raise Sam - break 'em up , jis' break 'em yo' know- suppose dey in dey own property, ah git at 'em dat way . Yo' know, dey much harder tuh move den dey jis' rentin'. In mah 'sperient if dey own property an ' yo' wanta make 'em move an' don't wanta break 'em up , yo' git manure from a bulldog an ' yo' git dat hoof or a hog an ' yo' git coprus [copperas] -yo' use po' tions of dat. Now, de manure from de bulldog, don't dry .it sudden -put it up in de shade somewhere where it will dry. Dat's bettah den puttin' it in de oven an' dryin' it. If yo ' put it in de oven dat's fo' ced dry­ing an ' anything is bettah dried natural. Yo' know dat. Well, it wouldn't take it mo' den about - if it's fresh when yo' git it, it wouldn't take mo ' den about a week tuh git dry , so yo' kinda pound it tuh a powder, see. An ' den yo' don't have tuh take a terrible lot of it, an ' yo' take about dat much of it, a good teaspoonfulla coprus or a good size piece of coprus lak this -·jis ' tuh move one family . An' yo' pound dat up or roll it wit a bottle an' git to a powdah. Roll it wit a bottle an ' it's bettah , because it don't fly all ovah. Yo ' mix those-­three things togethah. Ah reckon yo' jis' sprinkle dat where they must pass ovah - aroun' de do' an ' undah de front steps an' anywheres where they gonna pass ovah it. Yo' jis' make it fine so it won 't be noticed, won't be seen. An' ah guarantee 'em move outa there an ' raise Sam, fuss an' fight an' everything else, too quick. That's quick work. (Well, what about that hen egg? How do you do with that? You just throw it against the door and break it or what?) No. Now, yo' see if yo' cain't git one of these things , chew use de othah one. It may be so -yo ' take a certain time of de yeah de hens ain't laying much. Now, yo' want chure work done -yo ' don't wanta [wait] fo' or five months till de hens starts tuh layin'. Maybe yo ' cain't [get] to a black hen right aw ay · well, yo1 git dis coprus . Ah 'm telling yo ' de both so if yo ' cain't git one yo ' kin use de othah one. Now, de black hen aig, WHUT CHEW SO ANXIOUS TUH KNOW ABOUT - let's see if we kin have somepin tuh represent it heah so ah kin explain it to yo' well. (Here's your black hen egg -that match box [of mine] is the black hen egg. ) Now it's got a sharp end an' a big [end]. [She demonstrates .] Now across this sharp end yo' write their name right across heah disaway , see. Den yo' write it from heah right across there dat way -dat full name. (You are making a cross with their names right across the top of that little point of the egg.) Yes , de sharp end of de aig. Now, yo' make a little tiny hole in heah. (Rig ht where those names cross.) Cross - a tiny hole, jis' a tiny hole. An ' yo' set down wit a pin or a match­stick or somethin' an' put de gunpowder in dere -jis' force all de gunpowder in there yo' kin git. Then yo' take dat aig. 'You put both salt and gunpowder?) No, �! Don't use no salt fo' goodness sake - jis' de gunpowder. Yo' put dat aig in a fruit jar, a pint fruit jar. If yo' put it in tin, it's gonna eat a hole in de tin an' spill away where yo' don't want it. I usually use a pint fruit jar an ' - not a large one yo' know. Use a pint 'cause yo' gotta have somethin' wit a large mouth. Yo' set dat aig down in dat fruit jar disaway an '"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"1278 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -den yo ' put, oh , two or three tablespoons of coprus right in aroun' it . Yo' po' enough vinegah on dat aig tuh git about that high ovah de aig [demonstrates]. (About a half inch or inch over the egg.) An inch wouldn't hurt. Now, yo ' set that away somewheres fo' nine days, but fo' God's sake , on de ninth day take it. Yo ' take it out from dere an ' yo' take a stick an' put it in dere an ' kinda stir it up . Now, dat shell is gonna git soft. It ain't gonna be hard. Dat coprus will eat dat shell soft an ' dat vin­egah. Yo ' take dat an ' yo ' go an' po' it where they gonna walk ovah it. Of co 'se, when yo' po' it yo ' po ' it wit chure curses , yore wishes -where they kin walk ovah it. Dat move anybody out dey own home . (You just empty the whole jar right out?) Yes, see, but yo' keep de jar - yo' empty de ingredients right out. It's bettah if it's where it cain't be noticed, where it won't be seen - where it kin lay there. When yo ' git to the corner yo' throw that jar ovah yore left shoulder an ' yo ' make yore wishes . Den yo' go on about yore business. Don't chew pass back ovah dat. If yo ' pass back ovah dat, yo'll pick up dat yoreself. Dat's anothah thing . Anything yo ' put down - don't pass anything dat 's bad - don't pass dat place in nine days . If yo' gotta go in de next block an ' yo ' gotta pass by dere, go roun' . Yo' yo 'self dat doin' dat work , yo ' kin pick up yore own all de time. Yore own always comes back to yo'. Wit dis coprus an ' dis manure - dis manure must come from a bulldog yo' know, no othah dog . Yo' parch them. (You get about three or four parts?) [Evidently I had turned off machine to have this well-known rite of various forms repeated - but failed.] Yes, tuh dat amount yo ' know- jis' about dat much, dat's about two inches there. Take about two inches long . Well, den yo ' parch this up slow, don't burn it up . Jis' parch it till it be jis' a light brown , jis' a brown -not, don't make it a black brown . It's mo ' tuh dry it then anything else, so dat yo' kin powder it . Co'se one's larger den de othah yo ' know ; sometimes it large organs an ' not small ones . If a man leave a woman an ' she wanta bring him back - there's so many ends tub _that [so many ways to do that] . Well , de only sho ' way is tuh have somepi n be­longin ' to dat person , otherwise yo ' may be working roun' dere fo' months. Some people are easier tuh work on . Some people yo ' kin take a coupla [couple of] candles an ' put on 'em fo' a coupla days an ' maybe two or three candles fo' nine days an' so on -jis' sweeten 'em up , uses honey an ' sugah . Well, yo' gotta sweeten a person up if yo' really wanta sweeten 'em tuh bring 'em back. Yo' use honey an ' suga h both - yo ' use both . Then yo ' use high perfume [high-smelling], yo ' know -high oils-lak . Well, now if dey went away angry an ' yo' wa nted to git him pacified, yo' use anise oil or cinnamon. Anise oil is soothin' - yo' know, sooth 'em an ' makes de fuss an ' angryness go away. An' yo ' write the names three times or seven times - dat's de best, three or seven. Nine is usually used fo' bad work . An' three times dey say, is de Three Holy Names of de Trinity, an ' de seven times is de Seven WondePs [see following bracket] . That's whut they rep­resent. Now, yo ' may be nine days , or yo ' may be fifteen , or yo' may be twenty­one days , o� yo ' may be a month with that, because that person may be knowin' as much as yo', or dey may be goin' tuh somebody dat's got de rights on yo' all de time.

Now, yo' sweeten those things up an' yo' roll 'em up an ' yo' make a prayer to the east an ' yo' usually put 'em in a mattress, or den yo' put de sock undah de do ' undah a rug , wit de feet turned in, but yo' dress de socks , sweeten dem. Now, we make a [sweet'ning?] . There 's dat sugah . We cain't use no honey there - use dat sugah an ' yo' use powdered sugah, see.

B ut this could have been a temporary act of daring - induced by the spirits within - because I later learned he was known to others as William or Peter. Besides, I am almost certain it was he who had the fight with Doator Washington in the court of the house where I was inter­viewing: 11I must add - to emphasize the danger - that Washington had come to me in a treasure-seeking mood, having taken a few drinks of moonshine whiskey from his screw-top jar. After he left me, he and a doator waiting for me got into the altercation described elsewhere11 (quotation from p.l34, line 35f.). DOCTOR WASHINGTON OF CHARLESTON , pp. l32-135, is quite a story.

Presumably - or at least I hope- I bore the mark of the eleat or ahosen of God (Ezk. 9:3-7) ; not the mark of the beast (Rev.l4:9) .

But when he sits down , he took on the appearance of huge big white lamb . Now, while he flies to help you, you and the judge be sitting there and he's up above your head. Your mind can be against me but he brings his mind to you and after bringing his mind to you, I be the criminal at the bar, you gotta dismiss me from the bar.

He 's a kingdom's prince, exists like a god of the earth - never has lived in the flesh of the people, but we can't tell, we haven't got no -nobody know he's Gray Eagle. He's Gray Eagle and he ex­isted - when the trouble with England and the United States America and England, when having the terrible battle they claim Gray Eagle walked down on the bow of a boat and flew off. When Washington saw him, they brought the bird back and he proclaimed it a gray eagle , but he disappeared nobody know where he is. He can exist at no certain [something?], no race or people.

When he comes, he comes like a ball of fire - as quick as that. (Ball of fire.) And he goes and comes and represent to tell you directly what he wants -that's the way he does. (And when he appears before you, what does he look like?) He looks like the form of a man. (I see, the form of a man.) He's a white man - but he's just like he got on dress coat - but when he broaden 's his wings, you kin see he's an eagle. He 's not got an eagle face, he's got a man's features - pretty , fine man, and all look like silver, all up in here. But you never see him with black clothes on - you see with all light clothes - and he got nice - he combs his hair like a woman - beautiful appear­ances. And he don't speak like I speak - if you is an English-speaking person and can't speak Spanish, or French, or any language, he'll talk with you in words you'd understand - but he speaks flat - most like a Jamaica person. But if you can't understand the language you tell him the language what you want, and you talk with him and get along with him in that language. (I see.) That's Gray Eag le . [Here I stop to catch my breath while he continues , beginning with Crown Prince. 1 (There 's a man they call CI'OlrJn Prince you say?) Yes. (Well, who is � Prince?) Crown Prince is real Crown Prince that takes control of making woman lose children when they have in the family way . He 's a prince of the world. He's the father of Lucifer. Someone thought that Lucifer was the first demon. No. Lucifer couldn't no more do what God told him but [therefore] God let him go. God created 'em both by nature. All things was got by nature and he's call the Crown Prince. He's - he was [something? meaning ab ortionist?] with children ­given the power to know what to make, bitter apple - it's something given to drink - that's what G.Pown Prince do. But he comes with black clothes and white shirt. (Do you have to call him in some special way?) You calls Crown Prince by going down at a certain place in your yard or your home. And in calling Crown Prince, you gotta use the words a domini et patri ­et spiritu santus - et domini, et patri - et spiritu santus - Crown Prince appear before you. But in using him before you then, you may have on your property a magnet, what you call a magnet-glass you gets from Doctor DeLong in Chicago . -You must have that glass cause you gotta go see him personally like that. You will look in that magnet when he shot across there - like Moses went down in the cleft of a ro ck -way back in - and you see [him] . As you see him there, then you see him before you. But you must understand that. (I understand.) [I understand you can't see Crown Prince without purchasing Doctor DeLong's magnet-glass.] [Doctor Delong appears several places elsewhere -see also his imitator, Madam DeLong, p.90 6.] You gotta get understanding with these things, and you gotta seek the aid to get 'em and that divine aid.

C'NJhJford is a German doctor and the spirit of St. Anthony - a warrior with St. Michael. And when you get that in consideration with the spirit of St. Anthony, you gotta use dibby-dibby. (Use what?) Dibby-dibby. (Yes .) Log-wood. (Log-wood. ) Fur stick. [Fir stick?] (What kind?) Fur stick - a kind of wood that they grind and make dye with it. It grows in the English colonies. (It grows in English what?) In an English colony - English land . (I see.) Fur stick. These three woods, you gotta get the diff' rent juice from them woods. And after you get the diff' rent juice from these woods - why? (Why?) Because both of them wood was inclined - one was the headboard of C'NJhJfoPd and the other wood was his grave, and the other wood was a material of his house he dwelled in when he was on earth . [He had demonstrated and therefore I com­ment .] - (The other two were on his grave , the headboard and the footboard. Now, what was that German doctor's name?) Crawford. (How do you spell it, do you know?) C-R-0-S-E-F-0-0-T. (Crawfoot? [Crowsfoot or Crowfoot?] or Crawford?) Crawford - Crawfoot - something like that . (I see. All right.) Now here is a thing that big material - now, to get Crawford. There's many things in life that you gotta find. Sometimes, in looking at the [something?] religious person themself -seeing they [professed] religion is one thing , and knowing they [actual] religion are another. When you get Crawford just have de spirit what overshadow St. Mary. That spirit would overshadow this woman and cause her -but before that spirit overshadow this woman, there's a word to be used - \"and let them be [something?]\" - \"let them be not\" - \"do not bring them forth\" [three curses]. These words you must use - that's mind's material side . Now , to turn to the material side of life - now, when we get to the material side of life, I'm going to find out from the spiritual view whether I shall or whether I s� all not. Sometimes they [the spirit] stops you. But now when he do come, go call him in a quiet way to myself. I'm going to send him to take charge of that house - he's what you call a picket. He'll put a woman what one would still stay with me - one on the road - and one at the house - he's at the house. When my work is completed and he CPOSS that child in the woman, he come back to me .

You get this juice - the juice of those three woods , you know.) Oh , them three wood, you mean - the wood. (Yes .) Now, the woods that you git - these woods - you take these woods which is representative [they represent or symbolize] and place them just as a - like there's a grave in it. Put this house in it, and nothing more in it. You place them three woods , but that's to your own private [you must do this privately] -and you have to have a place for these - have to have a yard or either a house -it could be just that big , but long as you put one of 'em as a headboard on the grave that he lies in.

And when you get that black cat bone , he gotta come and appear and then you kin find from him what you doing. (I see. Now, you make this little grave at your home some place and then you call this spirit, you send this spirit to cross this woman -to cross up this woman.) Uhmmm .

(Yes .) Fur stick. (Now, wait . Fostick?) Yes . (Fostick?) Yes . (All right.) You kin use first, fostick, dibby-dibby - fostick and logwood. (Logwood?) • Logwood.

You forms what - you forms a trinity [triangle] of anywhere that you [working] at. [Usually a circle or square is used. This is a rare use of a triangle.] (I see. Do you burn candles in your work? ) Yeah . (Very often?) I burns candles but there a lot of mystery - there mysteries in a candle that brings you to the limit of the divine will. Candle bring you most - bring you the grease and dust -promotes the divine work . And you is not - you see, you can burn a white candle, a blue candle, a red candle, and a black candle. Now, when you get in the line of using black candles, you use them black candles for deaths. (You what?) You takes a black candle. (Yes .) And that's a person 's spirit level. See? And at every inch of this, you p ut that candle like that and marks it [demonstrates] . (Mark it with your fingernail, each inch right around the candle.) Mark inch - mark until you get that whole candle [marked] out. You set that black light - and with nine black pins . Now, that's - I'm killing the rascal. And I put them nine black pins in a circle into a piece of linen - black linen, pins it down. I set that candle on there , see. And in putting that candle down there , I light the top of this candle with a match and I keep that match and put it down there . (Put it in the circle or outside the circle?) Yeah. Then I use the words, \"Let him be with you - I'll never take it off this.\" And mind, the same spirit that I'm takin' in, this is the spirit of St. Michael - you've gotta use St. Michael - that why I use a black horse - and sometimes you kin take from the Revelation Gospel \"and his name was set on him -death in hell- let this be.\" You see, when that person name is written in that candle on the three sides [leaving 4th side of circle open; but cf.2821, p.810] , and hit written underneath that candle on that piece of black linen and you put it into that circle and you put it down in the ground, and watch them [some­thing?] and when that candle burn, when it go out, stick another on top of it -and you weaken him with three, and you lay 'em on the bed with six, 'and you kill 'em with nine .

St. Michael is the angel that never lived in the flesh. (He's a what?) He's an angel that never lived in the flesh.

Must be a person they are - then you must understand how to go and put the frog in a person, must understand how to put a snake in a person, must know how to put a lizard in a person.

(Well, will St. Michael appear before you? Or must you pray for it?) St. Michael - you can get to talk to St. Michael now, if you goes any moment. He's a easy saint to get to talk to, but he never have lived in the flesh with a christian spirit - he was created with the devil, created with God in heaven. (You say St. Michael controls that red candle and that person I'm trying to kill is the black candle.) That black candle. (Well, what do you do with that red and black candle? How do you work that?) Well, I'm got an altar - I'm got a hole in the ground or a secret place right dere. I'm got black surrounding it. And you know everything that you do, I declare you must have an immaterial spirit to govern besides that. [Things won't work without the spirit .] (You say you have an altar?) Yeah, have a altar. You got a altar some place. But some people have a altar - they might just have a house [or] they digs it in a hole in the ground. I put it in a place where nobody can go but yourself.

If I want chew and when you get asleep - I got chure name - I kin call you right chere and you'll come here just the same. But you are life­less till that spirit gets back to you. (I see. Well how would you use that name in calling me?) Well, I got something - I set right down and got your name before me. I pray before I do it though. Then I'll call. Is your name Jack or John or Henry, I say, \"Henry, Henry, in the name of the Father, I want chew to come here right away .\" Well, in about five minutes you will come . (My spirit will come?) You spirit will come -but you will look natural - but you are just as white as you kin be - but you can't talk plain. (Well now, suppose you want to send me away - send my spirit back there. How would you send it away?) Oh, well, I keep you about five minutes and I turn you loose and tell you tQ �' \"In the Name of the Lord.\" And you ' 11 go on then. But I don't do it on a windy night nor a real cold night, because the spiri t gets frozen before they kin get back - or the wind is too cold. (Could anything happen to my spirit or anybody do anything to it while it's gone, or anything?) No. (Well, what if the spirit got cold or frozen, what then would happen?) It get cold after while - that's what I'm telling you, you would get cold or frozen , if I call it on a cold night. I told you dat I didn't do it on a cold night. (But what would be the purpose of calling a person's spirit?) Well, you know, de soul is de spirit ain't it? Well, the breath you drew, you are jest perfectly dead when that spirit leaves you. You've got no breath there and when that spirit leaves you - until that spirit gits back. You don't keep it away but five minutes. The time is set and everything . (I see. What would happen to it if it stayed too long?) Well, if it stayed too long the person would die, that's all. (Oh, I see.) Then you kin take a new brick and write de name. Now say, if you want me to move from dis house, you take a new brick and write my name on that nine times, and take some gunpowder and go out there and take a long stick and put a piece of paper on there, and touch that gunpowder and that goes up just as quick as that. Well, you is gone - you getting ready to leave there, you can't stay there. (I see. That will drive you out.) You take some green sage and you get all de 'ciples. Dere's twelve disciples you know - Mark, John, Peter and Luke and all dem boys . And you write twelve on one and twelve on the other - six on one and six on the other, that's twelve. Then you fixes that in a cloth and put it in your shoes . You go to that boss and he'll try to say \"no\" at fust but he'll change - you've got de twelve disciples witl! chah . (What do you mean by writing six on one and six on the other? What do you mean by that?) Well, now like this is - this is Peter - that's John - that's Luke - that's Joseph and now James.

(If I think someone is trying to harm me , is there anything I can do to protect myself against it?) Well, now , if anybody want to fix me and you think you going to walk over it, you puts nine drops of fresh turpentine in each shoe and you kin walk over it all you wanta and nobody can't hurt you.

Well, you gotta to find out - now, if you come to me and you have them chills, I finds out there's someth ing buried and I goes and tells you where it's at and to git it. I went to Blackstone - a man came for me from Blackstone. (Blackstone, Virginia?) Yes. His wife was bad off .

Now dey had a stick about dat long [demonstrates]. Dey had a piece of her clothes and her hair. And this stick was hollowed out and put dere and buried right in front of her door, where she had to walk ovah it all de time . And she'd have spell after spell. So dat night I got dere, she was having spells dat night. Ah says , \"We'll have to go to work.\" I said, ''We cain' t wait till day 'cause we gotta go to work and take dis up .\" So anyhow, time it come day I had most everything and I said, \"Have you got any sulphur here?\" He said, \"No.\" Ah said, \"Well, go to de store quick as you can and get some.\" I says , \"Now, I ain't goin' take it up .\" I says , \"I 'm goin' show you where it's at and let chew take it up .\" So I told him go get a spade and he brought his spade and I told him how to dig to it. He got it up . And it was a ro ot about as big as mah arm, but it was hollow. And he got it up and when he got it up , ah told him, \"Now,\" I says , \"you go\" - ah say, \"ah gonna make a ring , a round ring of trash in de yard.\" I said, \"You put dat stick in this ring .\" I says , \"Now , de person who did it after you set it afire will be here . You git 3¢ worth of kero sene, 3¢ worth of salt, 3¢ worth of saltpeter - you sprinkle it all around , 3¢ worth of gunpowder - got to have 3¢ worth of every­thing.\" And you set that afire and if you done anything to anybody in this house you'll come here screaming - you'll run back and forwards , \"Please do something fer me , do someth ing fer me .\" So de woman come running back and forward, and she just screamed and screamed all dat evening. So then I had another case, that de woman was just as bad off as she could be, and I told de man, I said, \"Well, I never seen you and I never been to your house but,\" I said, \"there's two jars buried at chure door and dere's snakes in 'em,\" I said, \"and de water's turned green.\" I says , \"A man done dat.\" And I said, \"He don't live far from you.\" So he said, \"Well, lady , if you' 11 go with me ,\" he said, \"I'll be scared to take 'em up . If you'll go with me .\" I said, \"I don't see how I got de time .\" But anyhow I went with him and he tuk dem jars up , and when he tuk dem jars up dey was- dey was two jars about dat tall [demonstrates].

Now, de question wus dis. [ Another digression.] Ah'm [not] talkin' 'bout hearsay , ah 'm tellin' yo' 'bout whut chew kin read an' de records dey done made of it. An' ah git chew down tuh de fundamental principles of whut ah 'm talkin' 'bout an' come back home to yo ' [later about the dust !]. [Finally, the question!] De word wus , from Joseph, to de judge of de co't of Christ, \"Judge, we come heah tuh ask of thee permission fo' takin' de body of de crucified King down from de cross an' bury it in de earth- in de tomb.\" Read de New Testament. All mah speech is whut ah knows. During dat, de judge say to 'em, say, \"We have a law -we are [not] Jews [this could be \"We are Jews?\" meaning \"Do you think we are Jews?\"] - we have a law when we crucify strangers , tuh break both their leg-bone.\". Ah'm talkin' 'bout it to yo', but yo' kin read it to know ah 'm tellin' de truth. \"But fo' a cause,\" de judge said, \"we will not break this man's laig-bone. Take him an ' do as yo' will with him. Plague yore­self with him - take him down.\" An' dey did take him down an' dey did not break Christ's laig-bone - take him down all as he wus an ' taken him tuh Joseph new tomb , that he had hewed out of a rock fo ' his own sepulchre but his - [what he's goin' do with] himself when he died, dat man wouldn't wander whut he goin' do wit Joseph's body [when Joseph died]. After dey got de commission from de judge to take Christ's body down an ' not break his laigs, dey lay him whole in Joseph's new tomb , his words wus whispered in de co'ts, 'cause Christ said, \"Des troy dis body.\" His words wus whispered in de co 't, sayin', \"Des troy dis temple but in three days ah will raise it agin.\" One of de Jews heard him an' it wus brought back to de judge. De judge jlDilp up an ' say, \"That is what he say? Say in three days he will destroy dis temple -he will raise it in three days.\" The bystanders said, say, ''We know all de truth, 'cause it took our father Solomon forty-an '-six years to build dis temple, an' dis fellah said he'll raise it agin in three days.\" Dat brought disbelief in dey opinion, 'cause if he died an' did not take dat word back. [The name Solomon triggers the word wisdom.] Now, whut ah 'm gittin ' back to yo ' - to mah home start of mah own wisdom. An' where ah gits mah wisdom - it don't fail no man, can't be turned down. Dey taken de body an' laid it in Joseph's new tomb late Friday evenin' -understand me now - late Friday evenin'. It stay dere until de first day of de week, which leaves three days - on a Jewish Monday -an' de first day of de week made de third day. An' de body of Christ wus raised up , not by man's hand but by angels dat come from heaven an' rolled de stone dat wus rolled an ' placed on de do' of de sepulchre ovah de face of Christ. Hit lay dere three days. An' on de third day about sunrise, early in de mornin' , de first day of de week, two angels come from heaven an' one disappeared, an' one sit on de stone of' de do ' of de sepulchre dat King Herod had told his officers to \"Take mah seal an' seal de sepulchre stone fo ' fear dat some of his followers might slip dere by night an' steal him away an' say dat he did rise.\" An' so dey sealed de do ' - de stone around wit de King cement.

De two women dey come walkin' an ' one woman said to de other two , \"De Lawd said he goin' tub rise de third day.\" Dat wus de third day at daylight. About de time dey said dat , dey looked up an ' saw one sittin' upon de stone whose count enance out­shined de sun at noonday , an ' whilst de women is talkin' -Mary Magdalene - an' Mary de -Mary, de Mother of Jesus -Mary, de Mother of James an ' de mother of another one -her name was Taobis , de third woman - dey got scared. An ' while dey stand a-s cared , de angel on de stone glanced at dem an ' asked dis question , \"Fear not. Why seek yo' de livin' 'mongst de dead?\" De angel's voice said to 'em, \"I know whom yo ' seek.\" De women wus hurt, astonished. De angel said to 'em, '�o' seek Jesus of Nazareth - de Nazarene who wus crucified, but he 's not here . Come an ' see de place where de Lord lay , because he is risen as he said. An ' go ye into Galilee, an ' go an ' tell his brethern to go into Galilee an ' dere yo ' will seek Jesus .\" Now ah 'm back [! !!] to why dat dust dat rules de church - de dust dat rules skin games - de dust dat rule de country other den in de home - de portions of dust dat rules de contrary wife at home, dat unsatisfactory to her husband, an' come up to be a lunatic - a world-wide sinful habit - de dust ah 'm talkin' 'bout which is de Word of God. Jesus' Name is de Word of God. Yo ' believe dat? [I nodded yes?] _Jesus is de Name - is de Word of God. [I tactfully s uggest something ab out dust while machine is stopp ed .] Dat all right- ah comin' on back down to yo ' now , git it up to zo ', so yo ' kin go tub de Bible an ' read it, know it right, an' git de wisdom from God's heaven. Dat 's de greates ' wisdom dey ever has been- dis thing 'bout God's high heaven, ain't it? All right. Well, dat mawnin' de firs' day of de week de three women looked an ' saw one comin' -dey saw de Jesus dat wus crucified, dead an ' buried. He rez 'd up dis Monday mawnin', dat firs' day of de week. An' his mother, Mary , de mother of Jesus , run tub him- now, dis is gospel- run tub lay han's upon him. Jesus , her son, lifted his voice an ' said tub her, \"Woman, tech me not , fo ' ah have not yet 'scended to yo ' God nor my God.\" He wouldn 't let his maw tech him. Aftah his resurrection [I turn off my machine !] Ev'ry town de children undah twelve yeahs of age -dere descendents became [I turn off machine .] An' his mother an ' adopted father Joseph spent a day or two in crowds hunting to seek where dere little boy wus . He wus all right. An' dey found him in the lawyers ' an ' doctors ' office asking an ' answering questions . He could answer all dere questions - dey couldn't answer him not a one . Well, dat bein ' true - he wus nuthin but a twelve year ole boy . Now, ah'm comin' back down to [more sermon]. Btrt today ah'm tellin' yo ' whut chew kin do an ' whut ah does do . Ah don't rob nobody but ah does jes' in wisdom 's way as God would [sermon continues] . Yo ' kin go to any tomb - yore judgment will tell yo' a child is buried in de earth. So it look like less'n [less than] a twelve year ole boy - by a child, by de length of de tomb. Is dat right? [You can identify a child's grave.] [At last! We reach the dust -from the Babe of Bethlehem 's Tomb. ] De wisdom � God through conversion will tell yo ' which is de Babe of Bethle­hem 's Tomb by virtue , by length an ' by size. Dey does to a certain extent in dat tomb which ah could learn yo' later in de virtue of dat same - de dust out of dat _tomb - it's a virtuous tomb of de Babe of Bethlehem Tomb.

DE DUST OF DAT NEST IS DE DUST OF DE \"TOMB OF DE BABE OF BETHLEHEM\" - DE WORD OF DE EARTH. De earth is got words . (You say that dust of the dirt dauber's nest is the same thing as the dirt from the Tomb of the Child of Bethlehem? The same thing?) Dat's whut 'tis. All dust is de Word of God. (Why is all dust the Word of God?) Cuz God spoke de dust from tmdah de waters. Ah'm goin ' slow [so that] yo' kin tmderstand me . De tomb dat de Lord Jesus ' body wus laid into had been ready. Have yo ' nevah hear a man say dat dey had anothah [person] or a baby laid in dat tomb wit him? Yo ' nevah have , have yo'? Yo' haven't heard no man say dat anyone could go dere an ' slip a new baby in dere from Friday until Monday?

Have yo' evah read or heard any man, regardless tuh who he is , say dat dey believe or seen signs dat anyone could slip dere an ' slip a baby in dere on dat Monday mawnin' befo ' day? Yo ' haven't heard dat, have yo' ? Dey couldn't do it. Den Jesus ' body wus in dere warn't it? Ah'm talkin' plain. De body , yo' know, wus dere, cuz de king men cement [king 's men cemented] an' sealed it around de stone dat nobody could git dere. Yo' understand dat? No soul -body - nuthin in dere but Jesus ' dead body . Yo ' tmderstand dat. AH'LL COMMENT A LITTLE WHILE JES ' [TO] GIVE YO' A CHANCE TO KETCH HOLD OF MAR SOUND. [How could anyone keep a straight face after that! Here's the irrepressible , the unstoppable preacher I have known since a choirboy of nine - this one delightful.] Ah 'm gittin' back now to de dirt dauber nest, whut he put in his nest. From Friday evenin' until Monday mawnin' stmrise, at de first dawn of day , Christ got up out of dat eart' bed which wus de tomb . Yo' understand dat? He got up a livin ' body . He died from crucifixion an' den wit his word, say in ' , \"In three days ah' 11 rise - ah '1 1 raise de temple agin.\" Yo' got dat? He done dat, didn't he? Well, dat's de interpretation of de dirt dauber's today. Now, ah 'm comin' back down home. Ah have twelve- fo' teen yeahs experience of comparatively - dat de dirt dauber aig of being a live sustaining, breathing of insects without no watah, without any dew, without any meat -without anything atall - nuthin. Yo ' don't know where dat aig come from. Ah don't know where dat aig come from. All dat ah know about it is dat ah know it comes a live dirt dauber out of dat dry nest. Ah have tuh potmd it up , potmd it u p, an ' he some­times got wings an' sometimes he ain't got no wings, but he livin' jes' de same. An' he ain't eat nuthin nor drink nuthin - dat's back to de Babe of Bethlehem' s"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1331 Tomb. Now, ah 'm comin' back to it - talkin' 'bout mah work . Ah haven 't sold nuthin ttih nobody an ' ah haven 't sold anythin ' to anybody tuh make a fortune. If ah had , ah wouldn't be so po ' as ah am now. But ah shore have fo' teen yeahs experience dat a handful of dust from de left-hand side - ah'm tellin' yo' now [the great secret, the formula, is finally revealed!] - from de left-hand side of a baby's grave or tomb , dat is lessen den twelve yeahs of age by yore best judgment - jes' one handful of de dust combined wit de Word of God is a ever­living instrument unfathomed by man . Yo' don't know how come it'll bring peace. It'll bring peace in homes where de wife an ' husband have parted- de wife gain ' one way an ' de husband gain' de othah after livin' together 25 or 30 yeahs, an ' nobody don't know how comin'. Ah know how comin' , but ah won't go into dat de­tails now. Ah could tell yo' but ah don't want tuh go too fur out. Ah knows how it's done. But dis handful of dust from de Babe of Bethlehem 's Tomb - ah cain't git it, nevah have attempted tuh git it in de daytime . Ah gits it by praying de Father's Prayer at night , in a tomb , in a [grave]yard, regardless to de color of who it wus buried dere. Ah go - ah don't steal it - an ' pray an ' buy a handful of dust from de left-hand side of little Babe of Bethlehem 's Tomb. See, every chile [every dead child is the Babe of Bethl ehem] . Dis dust ah'm talkin' 'bout is de Word of God. God's Word is tuh bring peace out of confusion. Yo' believe dat? God's Word is a peaceable God. He's a mer­ciful God an ' His ways is past findin' out. His ways are everlastin'. Ah 'm talkin' 'bout God now. Ah 'm talkin' [now] 'bout dat dirt dauber's way . De dirt dauber - de way dat seed or aig wus put in dere, nobody don't know. Ah don't know, but ah do know whut it brings out. It brings out a livin ' dirt dauber. It don't harm nobody. It go to de mudhole, gits a batch of mud in its mouth, comes in an' goes to de nest an ' put it on his nest. He ain't fightin' ag ainst nobody , but his own aig he leave. He does lay in dat nest an ' seals it up an ' goes on 'bout his business - flies on away by de order of Almighty God. De wis­dom an ' birth an ' life of de Almighty God, de dirt dauber is mavin' onto it. Co'se we gittin1 a little further on now to it - de work of dat . As a hen lays aigs tuh raise biddies - dat right, a hen on de yard lays her aigs an ' yo ' let her set she'll hatch biddies, young chickens. Biddy , dat's a young chi cken. When a hen hatch a dozen aigs she hatch a dozen biddies. De' re biddies until dey git up large enough tub eat, den dey are chickens. But dey are biddies when dey jes' come out de aigs. (You mean they are like little biddies.) (Not bitties.) [The latter paren­thesis, by my transcriber, comments upon the former parenthesis, mine.] Like de dirt dauber aig comes out of de nest an' de dirt dauber put hit in, hit's a young dirt dauber tuh start with, but he ain't got no wings until a cer­tain number of weeks de wings bust out, an ' den he comes out an ' gits on de twig an ' go on ab out as he please, where he please. Well, dat's wisdom. An ' de mes­sage might be to yo ', well, how ah learned dat. �learnt dat by bein' de ser­vant in de wisdom of de Almighty God. Dat dust from the Babe of Bethlehem 's tomb is certainly coined, namely, in three names put in de dust of de Babe of Bethlehem 's tomb . It not ready fo' service until ah do mah wisdom. Ah put into dat - ah crush dat ole dirt dauber n�tses up into three tablespoonfuls, put in one \"In [the] Name of de Father \" -second one \"an 1 of de Son\" , dat 1 s Jesus - de third of de three dirt dauber nests in dat two dusts, all right, hit brings forth an Angel from God's Kingdom. Hit rules yore home - it rules anybody 's home. It brings love where confusion would be. To do dat ah have tuh pray befo ' ah git it. Ah have tuh pray befo' ah use it an ' pray all de time. It's nuthin whut ah heered. It whut ah experienced by de wisdom of de Lord"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"1332 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -Jesus. Dat rules de world. Now, ah 'm near to conclusion of whut wisdom will do an ' be learned, an ' let yo ' 1� dat wisdom in dat dirt. (Now wait - you put these three spoonfuls of this dirt dauber's nest into the graveyard dirt , don't you? You mean you have three spoonfuls of that dirt dauber's nest and you name them the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. You put that into this graveyard dirt -that tomb dirt.) Well, dat [Holy Ghost?] call de Angel by de Father's Prayer fer tub come on back down to de tomb an' go with yo' in yore home, recognizing God's Word tub be an everlastin' Word, 'cus dem three put in - de first one \"de Name of God\" -second one \"an' of de Son\" , de Lord Jesus - de third one \"an' of de Holy Ghost.\" Dat's de Trinity of de three God-heads. Yeah , outside of dese three spirits in heaven, de Lord Jesus say, dem three spirits is one - God de Father, God de Son, an ' God de Holy Ghost. De Holy Ghost means God in God - lak yo' hold a ring on yore finger, yo' cain't see where it is put together, yo' can't see where it come to an ' end, can yo'. Or even a diamond ring -it's a ring all tole [whole]. Well, God is God all tole, an' yo' cain't learn nuthin outside of whut chew learn from heaven's three God-head. Well , mah contention is. (Now, this is your principal power - using this dirt. This mixture is your principal power in doing your work. That the idea? That's your wisdom in most of the work you do - is using this stuff that you have prepared from the Tomb of the Chi ld of Bethlehem and the dirt dauber's nest?) It's de real Wisdom of God. (Now, you were going to tell me a moment ago how this man and woman - how there was confusion made in the home. Suppose you tell me how that confusion was made and how you could bring peace. Can you tell me that?) Ah can. Well, confusion comes in diff' rent ways. Now ah have tub speak some words dat chew don't understand, but ah know ah be tellin' de truth. 'Mongst white an ' colored, wimmens an ' mens, den dey goes tub work an ' brings a evil spirit in homes. A woman an ' husband dat is married 25 or 40 yeahs - some of 'em got half-grown grandchildren. Yit dey git where dey can't agree - dey'll quarrel at de table . De husband come in, if somethin' tub eat don't suit him, or if he go off an ' spend some money an ' his wife see somepin dat he bought an ' it don't suit her -well, dat brings [breaks] peace. Yo' don't want chure wife to grumble at chew when yo' done spent chure money fo' a good purpose. If she comes in a-grumblin ' at chew- ah 'm only speakin' now an' yo' know yo' done yore duty an ' yo' know yo' done right, if anybody 'cuse yo' of doin' somepin wrong yo' don't like it • . A man is his wife's one flesh. Let me 'splain yo' dat. De Lord Jesus say dese words - ah don't know if ah would talk if ah wusn't talkin' 'bout Jesus -see, ah ain't goin' lie now. De Lord Jesus ' word says - course ah wus a Negro pastor fo' 25 years an ' ah didn't learn foolishness outa dat - ah learned de wisdom of God. De Lord Jesus said, ''When man an ' woman have thus agreed an' have covenated each to the other as Rebecca an' Isaac did, dat man an' dat woman are no mo' twain.\" Twain means twins an' twins are two persons ain't dey, but Jesus said dey one flesh. _De time has come -ah 'm goin' say it cuz ah know ah 'm tellin' de truth -when Grand Co't cain't hardly run de two weeks session but dey take a whole week of it in divorce cases. Is dat right? Well, dem 4ivorce cases shows confusion, don't it? Ah don't want to git too fur, cuz ah wanta tell de truth. De judge is gota give hearin ' to every case comes befo ' him. If a woman got some 'scuse against a man an' wants divorce or de man has somepin 'ginst de woman - accusation, whether it true or not, de co't gota hear it an ' give judgment to it accordin'.

Or, de woman musta seen anothah man dat she want an ' has taken sides dat she ought not to, representin' de third party. Bring peace an' come it. Well, tuh do whut ah 'm talkin' 'bout - ah wus a married man one time , an' ah learnt whut ah'm talkin' 'bout from experience. Ah didn't see it, but it come tuh mah mind dat a second cousin must have visited mah wife. Well, she got so an' whut ah used tuh do -whut little money ah used tuh make wouldn't satisfy her.

Dat bein' true , the dust from de Babe of Bethlehem 's Tomb, he takes - ah tell yo' de fellah take de same tablespoon - sure as ah know ah didn't steal it -an' measure three spoonful of sugah from a tin -have about a nickel's worth. Have dat tabl espoonful of sugah put in where de dirt dauber nest an' de baby's tomb dust, an' mix an ' stir it good. Ah go an' measure a tablespoonful of sugah - sugah sweeten anything it go into, won't it? Dat's whut it's made fo' - fo' sweeten'. Ah put first a tabl e­spoonful, \"In de Name of de Father,\" second tabl espoonful den \"of de Son\" - tell­ing yo' dis dat ah nevah tole a man befo ' - de third an' las ' tabl espoonful- of sugah - represent de faith dat chew'll pray de Father's Prayer wit to git a angel tuh go everywhere in every business - in everywhere yo' doin' business - even in de skin game - or even in de church - if yo' pray de Father's Prayer yo'll win every time . Dat's de necessity an ' de goodness of - an ' de evidence of dat wise aig laid by de dirt dauber back - an' de wisdom dat comes from above by a angel -it's de Father's Prayer ah prays when ah go git it. Ah nevah has tried tuh git none of it till ah git down on mah knees among tombstones an ' pray, \"Our Father who are in heaven •••• \" Ah don't give it no money . Yo' is de first white man ah evah talk to in dat particular. Ah tell yo' whut ah 'm paying fo' it if yo' want me to. (What is it?) De way ah pays fo' dat handful of de Lord God's Word from in de midst of de Babe of Be thlehem 's Tomb, ah take a little clean white scrubbed cloth represent­ing de pure white linen of dat Joseph an' Nicodemus purchase when dey buried de body of Christ. Yo' always known dat, heard dat, how dey purchased pure white linen an' swathed de body of Christ -you have read dat, ah hope yo ' have .

[Since the Phi ladelphia Report several months ago about sodomy in the city prisons , a report discussed on television (Mike Doug las Show for one) , surely the public is prepared for almost anything . We have come a long way since Havelock Ellis, whose Studies in the Psychology of Sex ( 6 vols., 1900-1910) rocked the English-speaking world, especially the American part of it.] (You mean all the girls have to do that?) All of them. If you stay in that house, you have to be like that or you don't stay there. If that man - he wants to go himself an ' yet he doesn't want othah men aroun' his wife, he can take any personal garment of his wife, [even] if it has to be a monthly period cloth. He can take that out with him when he goes outside in the front of the house - if he have to, do it in the back an' bring it to the front -an' he can take that an' urinate on it an' plant it undah the do'step. That cloth with a pair of her stockin's or underweah, brassiere or anything that she wears , an' plant that there. Then in the meantime , he can take a plait of his own hair - any kinda way he can get it -any hair from any part. He can take it an ' plait it up an' ball it up , an ' cut a little bit of hole into the mattress - anywhere that it won't be noticed, an' take a match an' stick it into the mattress. If a man goes there, he can't be satisfied- he don't stay there but a few minutes, or sometimes he'll get right to the do ' an ' won't come in. If she wants him back, she can keep a pair of his dirty socks an' wear the socks undah each arm, or she can take a piece of his hair an' keep it wet by urinatin' on it an ' wear it tied aroun ' her waist, an ' he 'll come back. An' heah 's anothah way, if he's gone away - if he's out a town or if he's in town. You can take an ' write his full name - his given name an' a middle name an ' his surname -write all that name on a piece of tin an ' tack it up ovah your do' outside of the house. Nail it up there.

An' he can't use anothah woman, not to save his life . He won't have any nature -he may start, make the attempt but he can't do any good till he gets back home.

They may have a limit of time."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1387 They makes an evil curse on this child. Now, this works in [no] doubt several diff'rent ways and diff'rent actions. You kin -if they give it to a person , they kin put an evil curse for what [deformed] position you want 'em to be drawn into - er such as that. But - I'm little ahead of my story. Into the herb -you must only gather it only at twelve o'clock at night, but they come locatin ' it by day. They'll go back at night -they'll be there at exactly twelve to gather it, see. (This dBadnan root. ) Deadnan root. An' er by rubbin ' it onto the candy they [throw over] this little girl the curse what they had placed upon the herb , or as we say, the spell, for her head to draw back to her feet. (Her head goes back like this?) [I demonstrate •. ] Just right back. The relief of that is known to be as what we call the European mandrake. See, there's two kinds - there's the 'Murican [Amurican = American] mandrake and the European. Well, er, the European mandrake is only used a teaspoonful to a teaspoon of granulated sugar -that make two doses, and to them taking that, that will bring relief. [The European mandrake (MandPagom offi aincnvn) - mentioned in the Bible (Gen.30:14; S.of.S.7:13) -has been the object of magic and superstition since ancient times . A stemless plant with a large root - forked and sometimes resem­bling a man - belongs to the Solanaoea or Potato order, grows in southern Europe, northern Africa, and is common in south Palestine. This plant , especially in its exceptional shape, has always been used as an aphrodisiac -homeopathic magic. Revised Version (margin) of the Bible suggests an alternative reading for man­drakes -love apples. The tomato, a solanaceous plant once considered poisonous, was for centuries called a love apple. Was this the magic of taboo? If you ate it you would die? In any case, the fruit was small and tasteless - not the mod­ern vegetable. The American mandrake is the May apple (Podophyllum pel ta tum) , a different plant and one with a stem - one I have known since childhood, having gathered and eaten its yellow insipid plum-shaped apple. Here again , I do not know , originally symbolism may have been involved. The little use of mandrake in witchcraft and hoodoo once surprised me , but later I realized that changeless magic principles have changing outward fashions. Roots with particular shapes -man, woman, snake, twisted, knotted - I found rare. They were disappearing with the old- f ashioned root doator who gathered his own roots. ] (Are those doses given at any special time?) Any time you ketch a client that is -er , in agony - you make every -just like you would - a doctor would come in and write out a prescription , and the person is [in] agony perhaps. See. Well, this mandrake is handled very much in lots of cases. I've just received a letter now from Blackstone , Virgin ia. Two weeks ago , I was up thare and a young girl, Easter Sunday, was another of dose of one drop of snake blood was put into some candy . In some cases they go to work and plug the candy and drop this one drop of blood in it. Plug it out , dress it with whatever [they want to use and] they put candy or sugar over it again and pass it round to you. Eat that and the heat of the body will cause this here to become live in y�u, see. Well, that made it sort of - I only, just the same as I first said - I like to say that the mandrake is handled into insects and that sort, more powerful into cuttin ' 'em out from a person, by taking 'em out their [bowels?] . But behind that be that of using the oil of Perodium. (Oil of what?) Oil of Rolium. Oil of Rolium, they must use that after that - behind that."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"1388 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -(I see, sort of as a physic or something?) Physic - come right behind, yes , from two to three hours, as a opePation genePat [bowels movement] , you will have. Then, in some case - in some case I have come across of people puttin ' these live adders - that is , a snake - he 's very slippery . Well, they do the same, though , I find into using it on these live insects . Then I find another root - I do not know what it may be called -round here in Virginia and North Carolina. They never have told me the name of it , but I know whenever I get it. It is very useful , but you use into the 'Murican, you see , mandrakes . (I see.) By a tea made out of it - it is known as a composition of what we call as the Sampson snakeroot - see, for to kill it. (I see. You don't know the name of this root, but what do they call it around here?) This deadman root? (No , this other root you mentioned. You said you didn't know the name of it. They don't have any name for it?) Don't have any name, see, because then it was showed to me by an old person -his wife died here about a week -couple of weeks ago . Well, he was up - they didn't know their ages . They was a hundred years old but they didn't know which one the oldest, but then they told me -er , especially I go out there to the country and sit down with them, and they showed it to me. In lots of cases , or in some cases , where it become like it has diff' rent composition , can be made of diff' rent kinds of perfumes, etc. , that they use­dust in it, and sometimes those perfumes is made of - out of diff' rent sorts of flowers , and when they are not made out of flowers they are made out of other herbs , see. But it's so many diff' rent herbs that be's, say, combinationed together. It is so many diff' rent ways that a track can be used. See. There is some cases that a track can be used witter red flannin [flannel] , cayenne pepper, but you must take nine grains of pepper and sprinkle it over that, and take nine of iron nails - ten-penny. (Ten-penny nails.) Iron. See, they cut out of iron, you know, not the wire. There is two classes - one is a square head and one is round head . Well, you use the square head. (Oh , you use the square head nail. I see.) And you take de square head and you - nine of them and this track . You kin wrap it from you into red flannen [demonstrates] . (Wrap it from you.) From you. But they use -lots of those people who have danced with the devil, who have made a vow , that if they kin give that to any other person who'd carry it - but it's a curse. See, you make an oath as long as you 're -what the person must do in the space of nine day's time undertaking. (What would they do with that? You would give it to them in some way?) No , fixes the track. (Yes? I mean, they have to put it down for them or what?) No , it 's dtff' rent. After [that] they goes to work and they take it exactly at twelve o'clock. Then they goes -they'll watch the tides and see how the tides of the river , if it 's the flood tide; but if it's the regular stream where the water continuously runs, they only goes there exactly at twelve o'clock at night and pitch it over their left shoulder with an evil curse, that you will leave in the space of nine-days time ."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1389 As again, it [foot track] is used in a competiton of a reed.

And you can practically play any tPiaks you want to do.) To do. But it is used entirely indiff' rent, you know. There is such a thing as a person kin - if a man would happen to leave his home - have the same protest [process] but reverse it.

Then, it's other pervision [provision] - is that you kin shoot it at a home and send evil spirits by using the dirt off seven graves of [murderers?], but you have to have either four evil spirits or four good spirits and three evil [or three good] - that is, to do certain things. But if you 'municate with spirits that is entirely indiff' rent [the charged reed is useless].

This old man - his name was - I never learned any more - his name was Uncle Charlie Jackson. (Where did he come from by the way? What part of the country did he come from?) Oh� he was down in Alabam a. And he had three very large snakes. And if a person would come to him for to kill a person� the largest snake what he had would come out and crawl up in de door. That was his magic - that was the agree­ment what he made� you see � with the devil in selling hisself to the devil. Then he had another one what would remove evil spirits from a person. If you came in­to his place� while sittin' down into the chair� this snake would crawl all around you� all through the chair. You get up � you go by God. If you come for a gambling hand -his gambling hand was guaranteed fer one year. [See HAND, TIME LIMIT FOR� p.577.] He would take you into a little room and set you in there and when he get ready fer you� he would tell you - he would send fer yuh. Well� if he couldn't stand - the same way � if a person would come by for to kill a person . If you could jump over de snake what would coil up into the door� when you git back home he would be done kilt - this person. If you wanted a gambling hand -if you wanted to get that from him� when he get ready� then he send this other medium-sized snake in there. If you could stand fer him to come there and crawl around and you follow him back into the room� he would give you the gambling hand. (How did he make his gambling hand? Did he ever tell you?) Oh� he - makes 'em very diff' rent simple ways . (What was his way? Did he tell you that way?) The way he made 'em� he did. They was made out of little children's finger . (Oh� the baby fingers?)

And the distance of your place - if you can get a chance, the way they do - in the dirt is most the place the best. You places two to the north crossways. (In the ground?) In the earth [demonstrates]. (In the north - cross them over.) That's the first two . Then you goes south and you place two , but into this you' re going through a ceremony and no one would come any nearer and interfere , see. Then you goes then to the east and you put two there. Then to the west. After that you uses a competition [combination] of what we call bluestone and granulated sugar. Keep a fire in the stove and you pitches that into the stove on the real lucky hours - that is nine o'clock in the morning. Then you read the 37th Psalm, and after reading that 37th Psalm, you repeat what you want to be did. No one will ever come in. Now, here's a case what happened and I was informed a little too late. [This standard statement of doators comes in a variety of forms : A LITTLE EARLIER COULD HAVE SAVED THE BOY, TOO LATE NOW, IF YOU HAD COME JES' A WE EK BEFO ' , p.308f.] (Where was this?) This was right here in the city, 1934 , a couple blocks offen Washington Avenue there. The man lives there now. A young girl was to get married to a fellow from Portsmouth and she goes over and gets $5.00 from him to come over here. So he handed it to her and she came over here. They carried her from here - from the room where they went to to St. Vincent Hospital . They become to be lined up like dogs. They stayed thataway from February till the 13th of April. When I got here, I was a little too late. [This P.C. case - or imagination - must be a record!] Now, these remedies is - they are very simple and easy cured if you'd only know, see. Into a case of that sort, that is if a person is lined up, always go to a Catholic church and ask the priest to give you some holy water in a brand new glass and take nine glasses of water and pitch it right between them. That will put 'em apa rt. (They come apart - nine glasses of holy water.) Righ t between 'em. [My informant's words, they aarried her ... from the [[hospital] ] room, show that the doctors after two months performed the widely believed folklore opera­tion. This surgery , itself a piece of folklore, always requires the death of the woman to save the man. Why? I could never learn, unless according to the Bible and Church , woman for centuries has been inferior to man - she being his chattel and classifiei with his house, ox and ass - the Tenth Commandment, Ex odUs 20:17.] Some cases, they lines 'em up wit frogs, but into the nature when you line it up by frogs, you gotta get black-backed one, see. And take him into [your hand] with a rubber glove [informant is aping a surgeon] and shove him down in between there and let him urinate on the man and they'll come unloosed. (I see. That's a simple remedy .) But the way they do that, they take the she frog."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -(Any frog?) Yes , you see they know the male has a lighter color than the female, see . (They take the she frog.) 1393 Take the she frog and they fry it into lard, see, and after they fry it into lard, they take it and he will play with a woman and rub that on her. Well, the next man that will go there, he will be lined just like the frog lined to the she frog. (I see, just stuck tight.) Just tight. There's another remedy on that same method. This is by an old man who was known to be one of the greatest men - they give him away . They wanted to keep him in North Carolina. In slavery times they gived him away and sent him down into New Orleans , Louisiana. When you get down there, you'll hear talk of him . [I had already been down there and would go again.] (What was his name?) His name was DoctoP Jouse. (Jouse? Jowett?) Jouse. (DoctoP Jouse .) That's it. They goin ' tell you the man who won $10,000 off the Louisiana lottery. That's what he was -the old lottery hitteP. (I see. He was born in a city down in North Carolina, and then they sent him down to [New Orleans].) An' during them there slavery times they never could sell a slave. He would break 'em out with sores all over 'em, when they got ready to sell 'em, and they had to get rid of him - they give him away . (And you say you worked with him?) I was wit him. I was very young then, I was say somewheres about - say between fourteen-fifteen years of age . And he learnt me how to make the best hePb blood medicine in the country. (What was that you were going to tell me about him before - ab out one of his remedies?) One of his remedies - his remedy was on the same way of ketching a buzzard. He would shoot a buzzard and take the gizzard -take the gizzard out and take beef tallow and hog lard [three ingredients] and put it in the stove and let all that run out like, but he sews[!] it up tight and he'll give the person a box of that. You'll rub it on your wife, it would line them . You would go to the north side of blackgum tree and get a sprig, but you curses her every[where] you cut it - cut the person up on top, and in the ninth lick he would come apart. See -every old writer, author, he - to his practices he have diff' rent ways . Well, out of my 35 years, you see, I fell amongst lots of black art. I have been with people what tell you before de sun goes down they'll bump you Q[[_. One of the b ad fellows here - now, HERE'S MY REMEDY RIGHT HERE OF WEAKENING ONE OF THE WORST FELLOWS WHAT'S HERE . His name was Rogers Wheel. I made a combination of cayenne pepper , salt, sulphur - salt, sulphur , cayenne p�per. HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO KILL ME, see. All right, I mixes the stuff exactly at twelve o'clock in the day , and he was going to bump me off in nine [days] time. He could bump off. I'd taken this preparation and at exactly twelve o'clock in the day I carried it over and put it all on his gallery [porch] . It scared him so that he was scared to come out of his own home. He told his wife, say, \"Get someone to clean that stuff off.\" She commence to sweepin' it, and into that preparation I put a box of this here Flag Snuff in it."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"1394 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -(Flag Snuff?) Flag Snuff. You know that makes you sneeze, you know, and they commence to sweep and everybody down de road comm ence to sneeze. That fellow, he was hidin' in the house. (Scared to death?) Scared 1 em to death - S CARED 'EM ALL TO DEATH AND HE WAS THE WORST MAN IN BERKLEY. [At this time Berkley was a colored comm unity near or within the city of Norfolk, Va. For years it had been noted as the home of witchcraft, rootwork, and fortunetelling .] Everybody was scared of him, because they thought he was one of the meanest mans over there. When he say he 'd bump you off, he 'd bump you off. (What would he do - shoot you or stab you or something?) No, his author[�] of killing people was these square-head nails. He would go to the southside of a black gum tree at three o'clock in the morning and cover his head up with a coat - with his coat. You see, he had a vow made with the devil. And he would start that nail off, and he would drive it - on the ninth morning you would be dead, and [after] he would drive it all the way. (While he was driving this nail, he would put this coat over his head all the time?) Hold it over his head and hit it - he'd only hit it once [each morning] . (Well, how would they do that? How would they run a person away with their hair?) Wrap it around one of these ten-penny iron nails. (Squarehead nails?) Squareheaded nails, and drive it on the east side of a tree where the sun was shining on, and hit it [once] for nine mornings before de sun would rise, and in the ninth morning they will be gone. (I see, drive them away .) If two people have been separated for a good many years and want to unite back together, you may take the two hairs of the people and put 'em together and go to a tree - like a fork like that [demonstrates]. (A tree that forks like that .) Split it down through there and place this in there. When this tree grow back up together those two people will be united back together again. In cases of private hair - what they use for that - that 's to bring you a woman, or a man, either one. They will take that - they uses a class of perfume in this part of the country that they call Hearts Pe�fume. They will take some of her hair and some hair from their own , and mix together and roll it and place it into a small bottle - has like a bag the length of their person . Any time she wants you, she shake it and turn it [bottle] on the head [upside down] . You'll become to be in agony if you [don't] come where she's at. (Have you heard about the measured man?) Why sure. That is one of the hardest propositions without choo do know sich as that. You have to know personally. Sometime in communicating with spirits you have to use that for the restoring of manhood back to man. A woman if she take your nature and bottle it on her, you goes to work, you makes you a b�ttle of - [to give you] a small parable, go to the drug store, you get chluriform [chloroform] , sweet spiPits of niter and hartshorn [here = sal volatile] , place in the urinate in this bottle. Take ten cents at exactly six o'clock in the evening . Now, this is if she's got your nature. They generally wears it round their leg. Some of 'em, they may take it and ketch it on a piece of cotton and bottle it up with some other mah chemicals. These three mah"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1395 chemicals what I have just spoken of is only in de urine. You take it and you go to the grave and at exactly six o'clock you digs that deep [demonstrates]. You place it in the grave. (The urine bottle?) Urine bottle , in the grave . You'll repeat the following words , \"In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, I will hire you to go and make that woman who have me tied up, or bottled up, or haved me fo lded up\" [breaks incan­tation to digress] . Lots of times they only have your nature folded on a clear towel, see. Each one use a towel she take - take the towel what she usually put on top of her. [He returns to complete incantation.] \"She will go and get rid of it, In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit .\" Then, \"I pay you this ten cents for to go and bu'st that bottle and make her be so discontented that she will have to discharge what she have.\" If she do discharge that, the glands will have to be relivened anyway, because they are dead. Some cases is they uses a wash - th at is a wash of saltpeter, black gunpowder, either - in ice water melted or spring water. Those two waters is necessary to get for to make the solution for to wash. Some cases, you'll have to perform on them and give them internal medicine. The internal medicine is only made out from Sampson snakeroot - will bring the vitality of the man back to the proper point. This city here today is based on giving people stinging nettles . Here in this city here , they give a man stinging nettles - the women do - to take his vitality away from him so they kin go out, swing out very much , see·. Well, when they take [give] you those stinging nettles , they create ev'ry growing of the moon, see. And to that, I find into some of the medicine that will be used - into your medi­cine always, as I first said, give him - they will have to gather this or get it, the runn ing holly . [Does he mean ground holly = pipsissewa or the wintergreen?] (The running holly.) Let him take that. The running holly will become to kill these stinging nettles because they creep so fast. [Here a runn ing plant kills a creeping animal -see LIKE CURES LIKE , p.394.] A person with stinging nettles in them, they do not usually use any drinks whatever. Teas , coffee, cut 'em off. Don't let 'em be sweet atall - not any coffee or milk either sweet. And eat anything else what they want but no fish whatever, because the fish itself [he calls stinging nettle a fish] it grows more. (Well, how do you give them this running holly? By a tea or something?) Makes a tea out of it, then it is gived from a halfa wineglass per day - three times per day. (How do these women usually get these stinging nettles into them? Do they dry them or?) They dries them. The women don't do that; it is these doctors , these other doctors who works black art. They will take it on a clear day and they takes a board or something - a clear board or a smooth board and place it into the water, and when it beco me to dry it is like - they take it and let the water drain -see , it will jelly right on down to water. The least drop of that water they w:iil.l take, he'll become back to the same form and go inside of her [him] like that. --:Right today 100 percent of the mankind and also women got them things in 'em in this city here - I mean on both sides , white and colored, because these womens here - one man ain't enough. Now, here 's a case. There was a woman who had been taking a treatment from Dr. Nelson for three years at Lawrenceville, Virginia. They brought her to me"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"1396 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -on the 20th of December. I give her what we call as a myste!Y bath. See, a mystery bath is oompitated of er very poison - lots of poisons in it. The first they take in it is copper [copperas?] saltpeter, bluestone [here the same as copperas]. Then we uses 28 percent of ammonia. Shortly after that they gathers the dogwood tree root, they boil that water - no other water will be added into it. This water is placed - get cool - well it cool to a certain - all right. Then this powder is put in [in the dogwood-root water] and the person will bathe. The woman had taken three baths and now she's 52 years of age, walking around better than any day. Her husband lost his farm and paid him [the M.D.] for three years. The woman was cured in a space of time of 20 days. It takes her to tell you about these diff' rent treatments. There's one case I may make a very good success into it and have a nice write­up on it. It's a young boy who is in Washington , [D.C.], but his woman droessed him , has her hand dressed and rubs it into his back, and gives him what you call this St. Vitus Dance, see. Long as he had a good job, she wanted him. To get rid of him she goes to one of these black aPt doctors and he dresses her hand and she rubs his back and he become into this St. Vitus Dance. Well, this same treatment - he's going through it now - I won 't know till I get back Thursday. See , I will be leaving here, going back there Thursday. I has also the diff' rent - travelin' through the country I comes into all sort - into removin' of reptiles from de leg or else in de flesh. This is did through a dust. They uses very high - one they uses - they cannot make it with­out making , going to the grave of dead people and they must gather this dirt to do you bitterly haPm at exactly twelve o'clock at night. They gather it from seven graves . They mix it with the diff' rent snake dust and they sprinkle it -as today's the new moon, they put it down you know last night, or excusin ' it because the rain -you see the earth is open now and the earth will take it while you continue to walk over it. This stuff will come right up through the pores of the skin into the shoes and all. But very truly mostly used for that is -for avoidin' of that is what the� call made shieldS , that is roots are used of making made guardS [= made shields], so you kin walk over it so this will not hurt you, you see . [MY FIRST DOCTOR, p.933, showed me and described his shield. ] Those preparation [for the shield = guard= hand] is the devil' s-shoestring, de High John de Conker, the buckeye, the white coPime seed, and the gall of the earth made into little forms in a bag, or into a piece of cloth , just like this part here , that side. Every Friday morn­ing they'll wet with your urine and rub it together [this is fe eding the hand] . The same prayer is made, \"In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, I will walk all over, all on purpose what is put down there against me.\" You kin be walking in a communit� where something is put down for someone else. This cord [on the bag] will draw your leg, tighten right up on you, and let you know where you are walking is not right. That is some of Ole Uncle Charlie's method what he learnt me - the old man what I first spoke of. Also, he makes - but I find out into my studies, you know, in diff' rent - I uses my own methods in using - is this here souther-n John de Conker and this sam - well, it's a chinee root, I cannot pronounce it very good. It's a ch inee root, you get it from a botanical garden. Combination those two together and use a piece of p:t'ain American High John de Conquer; makes a talisman - see , make a small talisman and wear it on your body. And to stopping fits, I always used some - it's a ch romer[ ?] [common?] method. I used the gathering of peuny [peony]. (What?) The root of the peony."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -(I do not get that.) The ro ot of the peony. (Oh! Yes , yes - I understand .) 1397 [Old note of mine at this point reads, \"Peony root in Albertus Magnus.\"] That is used into spells we put on people, but you must always gather that exactly on the dark-moon night, between seven and six WHEN THE DOG STAR HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE HEAVENS. (How is that given? How is that administered? In a tea or is it powdered?) No , only wears it on theirself. (Oh , just wear it as a talisman.) As a talisman. They take three pieces of it as , \"The Father, Son, and Holy Gho st.\" Wear it around their neck. For removing snakes from my mother-in-law, I use a competition of apple cider, I use a half of gallon of apple cider, three gills of spirits of turpentine , three gills of kerosene . I used nine cayenne peppers , but spread 'em open. See [I do all this] like I'd be making a pomade. I used three tablespoonful of salt, of a package what never have been empt ied out. Then I shake this here very well. See, shake it very well and rub the outside of the skin. .The skin becomes blue. Then I take a piece of cypress and make like a knife , and take the edge of it [cypress knife] right down [the leg] . The leg opens, see, and the insect come out. Shortly, there are needed salves for that. The salve that was made was very common and easy - only out of fresh hog lard and saltpeter. That 's what healed it quite prompt see, because of killing all of this here no water'll ever touch it. If water touch it, it will inflame it, which is one thing . IF A DOCTOR [M.D.] OPERATE ON YOU, [when] YOU ARE POISONED, THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF YOUR BODY IS POISONED. THAT'S WHY THEY DO IT. [Having criticized the medical profession in the preceding statement , Doator English will now give another example of what should be done in cases of hoodoo poisoning. ] There 's a young boy - I don't know [him] myself - a young man came to me [first] . [Then] his people came at twelve o'clock at night over in Berkley [Negro community near or in Norfolk, Va .]. A man [was] having fits. They said it 's from one toe. His feet swole up larger 'en [= than (something)]. [This was a case] of using what we call the ma.gia ointment. Magia ointment, a combination of bluestone, the same as the other, but it 's made into an oil form- bluestone , copperas and saltpeter. See, but only using the oil - see, kerosene, rubbed thoroughly of gettin ' what we call - these people 'round here they call it the mulberry what's they mostly call it, but the name of it I'm trying to call it, because I know it as well as I know myself. It's - I'm sorry I can't call the name . (It'll come to you maybe later on.) And you rub the leg thoroughly with that , see. So after the leg is rubbed into that, three days later I take my safety razor blade and cut his toe open. I never seed anything - up side of his toe was horns all around it. I never witness of anything like that. (You didn't recognize what it was? You didn't know what it was? Just some sort of an animal or something?) •something in him thare - when I cut it, it hopped out, and the boy. (After you made that cut then, how would you - how did you dress that wound then?) With the same - only with - I uses a small sum of alcohol solution an ' iodine. See. Then you places the same healin' salve, that is saltpeter- made out of the base of saltpeter and fresh hog lard . I tried this out . That's what you wrap"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"1398 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -around the leg -sprinkle sulphur in the leg. (What is that root called?) The next root is known to be what they call _the shame brier. (Shame brier?) That's right, that's a root in Alabama. That root is used very much for lots of diff' rent things . It is used as a love root, lawsuit root - as they use it in Alabama in combination with devil' s-shoestring - of a small piece cut off, put in the mouth, chewed, spit into the courtroom. You'll get dismissed . To make a person do as you like fer them to do, a small piece chewed around 'em and spit around 'em - they will do as you wish for them to do. [See SHAME BRIER, p.646f.] It is known to be used as de red corimee seed - nine of 'em - at your own trial. Take nine seeds - put three at the first door of entering into the court­room, three at the courtroom door where the case is being tried, and three of those red corimee seeds into the judge 's seat. As most of these [hoodoo] people, they keeps in touch with the judge. Some of 'em, you see, they knows zactly when the janitor is goin' to clean out. Well, he's down there that morning and goes in there and uses that - fixes the seat with these three corimee seeds in there so he'll set on it. The name will be sugges ted - what you are supposed to be working for. As you take the corimee seeds and you give him the same - say, devil' s-shoestring and dirt off of a baby's - off of nine babies ' graves. You leaves a penny -you take a thimble you know, get holt of a thimble - one penny fer each thimbleful of the dirt very deep off the grave . There are diff' rent places of the dirt -you kin tell. The dirt that is near the coffin is like silk, become to be very separate [silky] . But the one that is on the high sur­face is very coarse see, because the strength of the baby is all through there or whatsomever remains of it. See. As those nine thimblefuls are placed and dried. (What do you do with those pennies, by the way?) That 's what you pay the spirit. (Where do you put those pennies .) You leave them on top of the grave, put 'em on top of the graves . Then this dirt that's used - there 's no baby ever was convicted, so a judge cannot convict you and you are dismissed. (That's the reason for it in other words.) Some cases of drawing trade to business places there are three babies that are - notice , you kin go to work and hi� 'em [their spirits] like today. You hires 'em today, you takes nine thimblesful of dirt from each grave. You will tell them to be at your home on the third night. When they come to your home on the third night, you make you competition of a in cent - [the spirits] come all around [you] . It's [incense is made of] cinnimin, spice , cloves and allspice . [It] may be placed wit this, this whut we sieve [graveyard dirt] , 18, theres 18 -27, 27 thimblesful of dirt from the graves, made with incent and put onto a coal fire. [This coal] is known to be mostly charcoal. Burn it, creatin ' people what you want to be drawed by it. The place will be over-run by drawing people on it. You sending the babies out to bring customers in to you - th at's what you hired 'em for. But you must talk and tell 'em that on the third night, when they come to your home r what you want 'em to do. And you only use that customary , daily. (That would be used largely by bootleggers?) Any business - any business place, restaurants, drygoods places and all. That is broke up by - _on the full of the moon you may go to a slaughter pen, or we say a packing company, and get two beef galls - couple , two beef galls.

Grease the navel thoroughly with beef gall, the ministration will become restored back to her. (This gall would be out of a cow or a calf or just any beef?) Any way they want. (Any kind of beef gall.) Yes, any beef at all. Restore that back to her. The same way ter a man, if his vitality is taken away the same way. You may take the fat of a piece of beef, take his penis and rub it out, give it to a dog and let him eat . Restore it back to him. But you must use sweet oil mashed into a bottle with soda and red onion as a oil from his knees [up] to this part of his stomach. Then his vitality will come.

Have you done any work in New York at all? Where [in Harlem] those colored people are?) Why sure, I have a place there. Well, New York was a hard place. I have a place at 250 - !27th Street, west. [West !27th Street would be in Harlem.] (You actually live right here , though , in Norfolk?) Well, for twelve years I've been here . I'll say for this sort of work, it's more favorable here in this city here than I have ever struck. (There are nice people here , too.) Yes, very nice people here . The most customers I find are based on that - 100 percent are based on the same level. (Are there many men or women around here who could give me information? Any of them here in Norfolk - not in your class, I understand that - but I mean other people who pretend and things of that sort? We have run across a couple - one or two - over in Berkley and various places .) Well, people over in Berkley - that's ab out the most - they call that - but those people over in Berkley there - see, I have a hospital over there. I have a hospital there on Walkers Avenue - and all the people when I came down here and used to read for and such as that, they become under the spiritualists -they are all spiritualists now. I just tell 'em quick, \"I'm only a Christian reader. \" [Christian reader, I remember only here - a clean term! The preceding state­ment by a dbctor who had lived in the comm unity for twelve years is valuable for showing how the old practice of roo�orking and allied skills was being forced by law into channels that could claim religious exemption. This man 's hospital was merely a room rented for treating patients in Berkley. The phrase to read for usually means cards, palm of hand, cup , crystal ball, etc.] Into one of my competitions of medicine what I made down here , I come to two sisters. The young girl, every time she become pregnant [types my transcriber, but it sounds like begot impregnint to me] she would go to work and lose it every seven months - never go any longer than seven months.

Of nine roots of devil's-shoestring gathered with the right hand out of the earth, made as a belt for her to wear and a small talisman [a seal] of this here - the secret [seal] of The Sixth and Seventh Book of Moses.

Some eyes into their -right into the edges of eyes you may ketch a dark yellow . Then the eyes become to be black . You may take her skin and look at her skin - the skin become to be darker. Then, in some agonies , they kin tell - that you kin foretell -you kin see into your crystal [ball] -may become to be dark and evil sensation - the crystal become to be real dark. You may take a deck of cards [see p.l95] . And if you run the cards to see ab out the cards, you will become to find into the cards - they will all run black . See, that's if you use cards. But if a person are clear ab out any sickness, there are certain cards are known to be sick . There is certain cards -always use your eight spot. Watch the eight spot if it turned up or down. It will tell you if you are eight points ahead of the person or if you are three points. It runs into the form of a eight if it's an the left side of whom you may lay out . You kin always -but the black card is to let you know of any blackness. Running from the ace of spades , the eight of spades, the ten of spades and the nine of spades , they are the most dangerous card of showing you the illness of the person .

That's done with the name. John did baptize Christ didn't he? But Christ was never baptized- it's done with de name. How it 's done?

[The preceding phrase in saienae, frequently used by Christian Scientists, has already been explained .] (What did she use the third time? The same thing , this worm grease and all tha t?)

He carried a black briefcase, dressed formally , acted what he considered the professional manner , and gave me his handbill. I may still have it . Finally , he is one of those memorable experiences of my life, performing, almost before my eyes , an immediate cure upon my injured contact man, Edward. This he mentions and I describe in the INTRODUCTION. Caffrey, informant 840, is primarily a healer, relying little upon hoodoo-manual remedies and rites. If you think he stalls a little, exaggerates a little, do not underestimate him - he is a professional. His material, broken up and reassembled with few loses, is on cylinders A447: 8 -454:1 = 1263-1270.] I wasn't born in Mississippi, I was born in Louisiana. (Oh , I see. Well , you are from Mississippi recently , I see.) Yes. (Well, you can tell me what they did. And speak loud, please.) See, th at's mah pitchure there, see. See, that's my pitchure there - I, my­self. I would get a h olt of the individual pitchure, see , and I would get me a black candle the size of about that [demonstrates], set that pitchure upside down [demonstrates] , and in setting that pitchure upside down, in twenty-four hours I would take a box of salt, see, and throw it around that black candle, scatter it about it, and make m�sh just like if I be making my wish there to the east (he faces east]. In twenty-four hours I'll have those folks leaving town . (I see. You must burn a black candle.) Must burn a black candle • • (Do you light that black candle any special time? ) You -well, yes , the best time to light it is twelve o'clock at night. (Light it at twelve o'clock at night. And where would you set that candle?) Well, I would set it in a special corner -not exactly a special corner, but in a corner where a chifferobe is at or anything to hide it to keep the other people from seeing it. (And where do you burn this candle - in your private sanctuary?)"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"1460 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -[A penciled note made years ago while checking the transcription with the cylinders , reads, \"A bad question. Fortunately he did not understand sanctuary or, if he did, did not accept my lead.\"] Well, in your private room -any room that anybody don't tFapse [a rare word pronounced tFap'see by people during author's boyhood- a variety of tFaipse or tFapes , pronounced traps by dictionary= gad or wander] about. That's if you don 't want to let no one see it. But it best where you can see it. And in set­ting it though, you curse - in other words , in setting it you must talk to it, cuss it. And in talking to that [picture ] you just tell it just what you tell them people, just like I'd command you to, \"Leave here, you dirty bastard! You must go. I suffer for you to be drownded.\" Just talk to that in that form, and talk to that candle. And in talking to that candle why you induce that, and --­whatsomever that's to be done it do 's in 24 hours - sometime they may happen to break their neck. (Now, what did you do to make that candle go out?} That's all right. I'll draw me a glass of water - see, draw me a glass of water at the hour of nine o'clock in the mo rning. You gotta draw it - and you draw that water at nine o 'clock in the morning and I 'll h ave that water to set until ab out three o'clock in the evening. I'll take this crucifixion of th;-­�s [= crucifix - symbolized by nine to three o'clock] and I'll say my OuF FatheF PFayeFB over that water three times , and I'll have the individual to blow in that water three times, a nd in blowing in that water three times , I111 have him to repeat, \"The Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,\" and then I 'll place my hand upon his head and say, \"The Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,\" and have him to make his wish to the four p aFts of the land [often called four corneFs of the WoFld] , and I'll guarantee you those lights will go out in three hours time , and the headache condition dat they are suffer­ing with, it shall be moved. (I see, they 'll move away.} Move away. (Now, what did you say that he makes his wishes to the four co�eFs of the eaFth for? Why did y ou do that?} It's like east - well, say east, north, west, and south . See. (He mUs t face the east direction as he makes the wish?} Yes , that's it - as he make it. But make it with faith. (With faith . I see. I understand . ) With faith -be made with faith, and it sure be gone . It must leave him and that condition won't come back. Now , if that condition is - there is no way for that condition to come back. If that condition come back , see me . But there's no way for that condition to come back . (Well, suppose somebody is putting down something 'for me? Somebody is trying to harm me in some way?} Supposing someone is putting something down for me to walk over, and what kind of a condition come about from it - a leg or something like that? (Yes.) Well, if this condition comes ab out a leg or something like that, and they feel that that leg is affected of some kind of evil 'vir'mint [environment], just go to the dru� store and get a bottle of ammonia. You see , you can get the bot­tle of ammonia and then you ask for a bottle of bay rum. (Bay rum.) Bay rum , you see . And after that you get a bottle of antiseptic - you see, that.

And in stirring that to great"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo -Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1461 'vir'mint , you put that down into -you put it into a quart bottle , if you got a bottle . And you set it into the earth for nine days and after the ninth day you take it up and rub for nine mornin�s, you see . And in rubbing for the nine morn­ings , it be's at the hour of six o clock in the morning. That condition should be moved. Evil 'rlr'mint . (What can you say about that?) Well, such things as going out to the forks of the road . Whatcha mean? About putting something d own? Or just making a wish? (Anything that comes to your mind.) Well, say , just like somebody would - m ostly about somebody would throw some­thing in the air or something like that? Well, w e'll lay a parable - we wouldn't exactly say throw something in the air, we 'll [say] that maybe somebody might put something in the road to aPoss somebody else. You get the idea about that? And in a�saing somebody they might cause them to be sick for about six months. That's wh at you want to know about , a condition like that. Well, all right, such a condition like that would come ab out - it wouldn 't be nothi ng for you to do but just go to work and get you some clay dirt, and also some sut [soot] , you see, and in getting some sut , well, you can just mostly about get some clear water and in getting clear water, you might g et some black pepper and use it to great 'vironment, and then you might put that into a flask, and you'll catch some rain water. See. And you'll catch some rain water and you'll take a red light and set it on that and burn that for three days. Get the idea about it? And in burning that red light for three days , you make your wish, and you rub continual with that and then you take your bath three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Get the idea about it? And in rubbing it on Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays, you makes your wish to that light , and after you using that red light, well that light will burn comp letely yout. And you take that red candle. You get the idea ab out it? And you take some of that [candle] wax and put it there and you continue using , and you take your bath three times a week, and that condition will be removed - reduced -what you call reducing 'vironment. GPaveyapd diPt is supposed to be for killing . GPavey� diPt is supposed to be - in other words, gPaveyaPd din is to bring ab out some k ind of confusion and bring about a killing scrape or cutting scrape or shooting scrape. Well, all right , that condition can be mastered in some form or another easy enough . All you would have to do, just take three buckets of water, see. Put three buckets of water in a tub, see. And put three tablespoons of sugar in that tub and scrub that house from front to back, you see , On Thursdays , Tuesdays , and Sundays. Read the 66th Psalm , read the 23rd Psalm , read the 35th Psalm of David. You get the idea about that? And then you might go in some place or another and get rock incense. And in getting the rock incense, you might smoke that house out three times a week -that condition shall be reduced, removed. [Someone is] trying to master you. All right. Say, for instance , now, you is a lady's friend . All right . You is a lady's friend , and since you come to be a lady's friend, she cares much for you, and mayb e perhaps you might be after some of the other girls. You see. You get the idea about that? And she want to brlak you. All right. She go -this lady friend of yourn might get some kind of bread , this light bread, and break the bread up in six parts, you see . Get her a pint bottle , that little thick bot tle of van-van - the van-van very thick bottle [my only information about the bottle]. You get the idea about that? Put that bread in there.

And then in putting that bread in there, she get about half of� a iialfa pint of your urine and pour on top of that"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"1462 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -bread. You get the idea? Then she'll get a jar of honey and pour on that. Get the idea? And in getting the jar of honey and pouring on that, she'll get nine pins. Get the idea? And put up on top of that honey and that bread. Get it? And she'll write your name down and put it three times upon that urine , and just in writing your name and putting it down upon that urine , she 'll [shake] that bottle at that particular time and wheresomever that you at or wheresomever that you gone, she'll just call you - as your named George, just like your name is George -she'll say, \"George , I want you to come here.\" You can't go away­that 's to control your nature. I want you to bring me just whatsomever you got for her, you bring it and you divide with her, from the beginning to the end, and then you won't have no vitality for no other woman. Ev'ry time you see her, you'll have a heart for her all the time but - all right. I left 'vironment out - oh , oh , oh , I missed 'vironment. But after she go to work and put that bread upon that urinate, she go to work and put the honey and put nine pins , b ut she place that bottle up under the steps where you going to pass over - where you going to walk over -turn it upside down like this, put it upside down. Now, you understand me good. (I understand.) You see . And you walks upon that - you walks over that. (Turns it upside down?) Bottom upwards . (Bottom upwards and she pours the water over that for nine days?) Nine days and in the ninth day she takes it up . And in the ninth day she takes it up but she don't keep it in the house -she might take it to her friend's house. But she control you by shaking it like that. And as your name George , she say, \"George, I got you now and you can't go nowhere , and you' re for me and I going to have you long as I live, and you cannot fool with no other wo­man.\" You see? Well, that controls your natwoe and she ties you, and you be crazy about her and if you leave her -if you leave her - you might leave her and stay away from her, but in the ninth day , she 'll bring y ou back just by sha�ing that bottle. She'll control you from the beginning to the end . (I see.) Well; let's say something ab out the people go to hoodoos and in going to hoo­doos, why they'll �x up the man and the woman into a shape • ••• I done see how it were done - how they dance a person to death [see pp.794, 796, 1279). They get a-holt of your hat , you see, get a-holt of their hat and take it to a oak tree, y ou see, and in taking it to a oak tree, you make some kind of a foundation -put it near, close to the root, not too far from the root, but near to the root, you see. And they'll make some kind of foundation and they'll just set that foundation up on top of that, and they'll use nine black candles, you see. And as they' ll use nine black candles and they'll start to dance and they'll step like that. [He demonstrates.] It's a ole dance they got. They'll dance , dance till you kills yourself. They j u st dance, dance, you see and they111 do that for nine days -just make you dance and kill yourself dead. Get the idea about that. (Where do they burn those black candles -out at the oak tree or in their own home?) Well, you J>urn those black candles o ut at the oak tree , but you want to get somewhere where nobody going to see you - out into a far prairie somewhere. But you wanta get you some kind of something just like a stone , or say like same stone just about the size of this, or something like that - a real stone or a piece of steel, where those candles can't turn over.

See , there 's St. George , he 's coming with two swords on his horse. All right. St. Michael - you use a red candle to St. Michael . Do you get the idea about that? All right. And St. George, you uses a blue candle to St. George. Get the idea ab out it? And you use that blue candle for ni ne days - as one candle burn out , you light another one - for nine days, continue on nine days. And those candles do most anything that you want them to do . (You just light the candles and make the wish to them?) Make a evil wish to that. Tell him what to do and mean it -with a evil 'viPonment, and then after that, you cuss it. You get the idea about that? (Did you ever hear of St. Expedite?) Oh , yeah. (What do you know ab out St. Expedite?) St. Expedite is a kind of a wonderful saint, too , for most anything you want to be done. Now, Saint Expedite, you use a candle that - a yellow candle, you see. And you use that yellow candle [he demonstrates] - you take that yellow candle and you write the party's name three times on the side of it, and then you take one pin and you put it in chere and you take one pin and put it in here. You take three pins altogether and put them there . You get the idea about that? (You put one in the bottom.) One in the bottom, one in the side , and one in that side. (And one in the other side.) Yes. And you take that St. Expedite pitchure and you turn it upside down. You see . And all right, you turn it upside down and you might take a nickel, just like that [d�onstrates] and stand that nickel up side of there some way or another, you see. You get the idea ab out it? And then you take a nickel and put it up­side down and you might take a shot [he means some powder from a shotgun shell] -see, what you shoot in a gun, and put it up side there, y ou see. And you light that shot [powder] and that shot [powd er] go off, and whensomever that shot [p owder] go off, that evil 'viPonment just crack. (And what will that do then?) That destroy that aPoss over you - that kills the fellow. (How do you know you're getting the right fellow? How do I know that I'm going to kill the right fellow?) Well, you know that you killed the right fellow because you know directly who you want to do it to [the doctrine of intention] . Just like his name George, you command him, \"George, I command you to go. I command you to die.\" See. \"I command you to live.\" (Well, suppose you tell me something about her.) Well, she -St. Rita is a saint that she don't allow no man around at no time . She mostly fighting men . In other words she kill mens all the time . In other wo;ds she take people out of your family. I'm satisfied to know that St. Rita take people out of the family, because I had St. Ri ta in my place one time where I was operating my business and she taked my uncle and my grandmot her out - I'm pretty sure she did. See. And after I got her out of my place, why , well, much more of my relatives never did die. St. Rita is the kind of a saint that do fighting -takes away. And she's nasty to the effect.

If you make your wish to him - and in making your wish to him, you make it very sincerely, you see . And in making it very sincerely, you get up -you start roZZing, you see , and roll about half a block, and just re­peat , \"St. Peter, St. Peter.\" Make your wish to St. Peter and then you take two keys [he begins to demonstrate], see, take two keys and hold 'em in your hand like that [he devoutly takes an imaginary key in each hand ] and you make your wish to the four corners of the ea:I\"th. Then you bow like that [he bows ] just like a Catholic priest, and yo'll get your wish. (I see. You hold a key in each hand.) In each hand, yes. (Now what do you mean, you roZZ?)

Yes. (Then, you don't get on the floor to roll -just do this sort of thing?) Just make that - you get in there li ke that and �zz it. (But wh ile you are standing before the picture .) But , until you get to the pitchure, you got ab out halfa block, see. Not exactly halfa block , say somewhere along about 13 or 14 feet - something like that, 14 or 15 feet. (And just �zz up to that picture?) Just roZZ up -to that picture . (And then ask for the request?) Ask for the request. (I see. ) (What do they say ab out St. Raymond?) St. Raymond is a w onderful saint . St. Raymond is a saint that is a great saint and St. Raymond will do most anything that you want to do, but you mostly have to use St. Raymond on a Thursday . And to St. Raymond -you want to use a green light to St. Raymond. And you use a green light and you take a quarter and you put it in a saucer, you see. And you set that quarter in a saucer, you see . And you set that quarter in a saucer and you set a green light upon that. Get the idea about it? And in putting that green light upon St. Raymond, you get a glass -you see, I'm talking ab out a looking glass. Get the idea about it? And you run that St. Raymond out -that green light out, you see , and then you let it set right to that glass. Get the idea ab out it? And when it get to that glass, say, \"St. Raymond, St. Raymond, I call you. I call you at this particular time to find \\nto distance [to see into the future] .\" You see . And you'll have finances to come from New York. [The implication here is obvious.] All right. And after that -after you done - just before - in other words, just after you light that green light, you read the 56th Psalm and the 21st Psalm , you see.

But you'll have that into the drum all the time and you making, blowing the horn and beating the drum and going on, and that spirit will remain over in New York somewhere maybe, make a whole lot of noise and will scare people out , and have people to run away and go on. Then you can take bones again and you_cap put 'em in a barrel and roll 'em so-forth-and-so­on , and go on like that and roll 'em in the barrel and that cause them, c ause that spirit to come about into the hospital, come right into very important"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"1466 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -places, into banks and eve rything, and scare people and so-and-so like that.

You git you a red can'le and you write her or his �-whosomever you want to come back home . You write it down on a piece of paper ain't never been used , writing paper, with a indelican pencil. Don't write it �ith no ink penai l, cause it ain't no go od ; and don't write it with no lead pencil - an indelican pencil. You write it with an indelican pen cil and you set it right in a lit tle saucer, that can 'le . You set it in a little saucer and you put the can' le -put the paper under the can'le a nd you burn it for nine days . (You put that paper right under the candle? You put the candle on top of it?) Yes, sir. Don't burn the paper at all. (Do you burn that candle any special time during those nine days?)"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"1632 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hy att Foundation -No , just burn it for nine days . You light it at six in the morning - you light it at six in the morning and put it out something to eleven . Now, the reason I know about that can'le proposition cus my husband had done left me-and by a lady showing me how to do it. I have did that and I know that work . (That will bring him back?) Yes , sir , he'll come back home. Don't care if he living way, way from here; if he got de freight train his way, he 's coming back . (I see. Now , you say, you take five of these ten-penny nails and you put one in each corner. What about that door? Do you do anything with that?) Ten-penny nails, yes sir. You take that one what you have left over and you put it at your - not at your back step. Put it right wh ere he when he come -he goin ' to come, that candle goin ' to draw him -and when he come he got to walk. Well , that's the first thing he got to walk over - he got to walk over that nail . Now , when he get in the home, you got him nailed in the home -you got him nailed down in the four corners of the house, he can 't get away. When he get in the home, he ain't never going away no more - he going to stay with you. Jus t as if you say , \"Come on , let's go thisaway,\" he right there with you. Show you right now and ah tell you how to do that. Ah can do that my self. Ah keeps mah husband thataway. You got to give him somethin' sometime to keep him from running around. And you know, when somebody teach you somethin' and learn you somethin' , you going to try [ it] . So, all right , you takes you a piece of white cotton - go to the store and buy you some yellow cotton - not this white cotton or - it have to be yellow cotton [unb leached cotton] -jes' a simple little thing - just five cents - buy you a yard of that. And just like when you all lie down together, you wipe him straight nine mornings with that [several words blurred- recording not too good anywhere]. (You mean straightened out?) Jes ' take a rag- jes' like if he uses dat rag -don't use it on yourself ­jes' use it on him and after them nine mornings is out, well you take and you tie you nine knots into that cloth and wear it around your waist as a band - see, he'll never know, he'll think you all is tied like as if you is bandaged up . But whensomever he going to connect with somebody else he can't -he ain't no good there -he just like it - ain't no service to her. (Like it ' ll fall.) [This s uggests she had demonstrated with finger or hand after her word it. ] (I see.) (Well, now, suppose a man knows ab out it. What could he do to get rid of that condition? ) He goes to the store, to the drug store -you have to go to the Crackerjack Drug Store , to the hoodoo store . That's the hoodoo stoPe, the Crackerj ack Drug Store . You go - first, you go to the store [non-hoodoo] and you buy you a white pocket handkerchief - let it be a white handkerchief . You buy you a wh ite hand­kerchief - jes' like if you buy this white handkerchief, don't you wipe your face or nuthin with that wh ite handkerchief.

Well, you git you some love pow­deP -love powdeP at the Crackerj ack Drug Store , and that white pocket hanker­chief. Let it be a pure white pocket handkerchief, a big-sized handkerchief. And you take that handkerchief and you fold it coming to you, and you say, \"In t he Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, take this feeling off of me , and let me come to be a real man or real wo-man [woman]. \" Whatsomever or whosomever it is fixed like that , say , \"Let me come to be, so I can u se my body"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -1633 once more in life , In the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost .\" See , n ow , when you say that, you take that Zove p�deP -you _got to keep that handkerchief just like you keep your body , clean, you know, but have it in a nice little clean box where you can take that Zove p�der and sprinkle it on there for nine mornings straight, and if you loves them, your feelings going �o come back to you. It kills her hand or his hand -whatsomever it is, it kills it. [\"Her hand\" in this case is the cloth or bandage wrapped about her waist.] (I see - and he is all right again .) And he 's - he 's a natural man again or a woman. [While machine is stopped, I ask a question and she evidently answers, \"They do that with a black can ' le . \"] (What do they do with that black candle? Do you know how they handle that in church?) [Church � private church or shrine .] They write- they don 't write no name on no paper . They takes that black can'le -you see , from the way you burns it , you take it and you turn it upside down and you start from the burning part of the can'le with the name, whosomever you want to kill. You see , you write it from the burning part of it -let the burning part be down like this [demonstrates] . That 's writing it up side down. And you write dey name all way around that can ' le, all the way around, and when you done got all the way around, you come back over it again -just like you written a mistake with the name, writing the name on that. And you take it and you set it in a little something like this here [my ash tTay] , and you stick you two little needles - but not no , not dem fine needles - you stick you two needles about that big [demonstrates]. (About two inches long .) Yes, sir. [She continues to demonstrate.] (You cross them in there like an \"X\".) Cross 'em in there. See, when you cross [demonstrates]. (I see -like your fingers are crossed .) Yes , sir, when you cross 'em in there, well, that's to kill . You know, you got to put a cross , you got to put a cross at your head when you die. Well, that 's your cross - them needles is your cross. You going to die in about nine days or more -you'll die. (When do they burn this candle?) You burn that can'le Sunday , Monday , Tuesday and Friday and - Thursday , don't burn it . (You don 't burn it on Thursday?) No , sir, you don't burn this can'le to kill on a Thursday at all. (Is there any particular reason why you don't burn it on Thursday?) Cause it won't work to kill. (I see , I understand .) It won't work to kill - it'll be burning again, you know. And you got to go to the store and get you some saint - see, if you believe in saints. [She calls them sents .] Some of the saints is really true 'cause I knows it 's true for my­self, 'cause I have my money saint in my home now, and I prays to that saint and I burns mah can'le to her. Ah burns a white can 'le -they loves white can'les . Anc I got a green leaf to it. A green leaf is [means ] dressed in money, and the saint got money down in front of her as she kneeling down praying to the Lord. She is praying to the Lord for money. You see, when you got one of them in your home, you always -you don't keep no fortune of money, but you keeps from being on a strain all the time . (Now , what is this saint? That little?)"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"1634 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -St. Raymond, they call 'er . You jis ' go call for St. Raymond. The man know wh at you want.

You walk in and you say -you ask him , you say, \"I want a saint of St. Raymond,\" and he goin ' to give you St. Raymond. (And wh at does it look like -a little statue?) No , sir, he 's got some in statues, too . You can get a little s tatue, but this here is in a pitchure. This here is made flat just like this [top of table hold­ing Telediphone] - a little pitchure. (A little tiny thing?) Yes, sir, you take it and put up on the side of your wall. (You hang it on the wall.) On the side of your wall - over your bed, anywhere. (Then , what do you do with the picture?) You burn you a can'le, a snuff-lookin' can' le to it -jes ' like you see de lady dressed, you burn that can'le to her. Maybe she got a-had on a red robe and a snuff-colored frock. Well, you burn that can'le -snuff [ colored] towards her , and give her a green leaf. (Well, what's a green leaf now?) The green leaf is one of them -ah , cedar trees. You know, them little cedar trees. Well , you take a leaf off the cedar tree and put it in a little vase right in front of her, just say, \"Here - here , St. Raymond, I want you to bring in money to me .\" Being you tell her that for nine morn in 's and you can just walk out your house and just like you say, \"Well , I'm going to spend my last dime or my last quarter\" - whatsomever you hav e. You go and you sp end your last quarter, and when you look, if somebody give you fifteen or twenty cents [back in change] , [they will] give you your same quarter back. An' it really draws money to you. (I see, I see.) (Now, that candle to burn is a snuff-colored candle.) [I wanted to be certain because St. Raymond's candle I soon learned is usually green for green money.] (What do you do with that holy water?) You take that holy water and you sprinkle it in all corners of the house. Sprinkle it around - that's to keep your home holy . Or, if you got a store , that's to keep your store holy - keep you out of troub le and ' cumulate - [also] make you 'cumulate things around your home. You see , th at holy water is blest by de priests and things and then it's blest by the Lord , you see. (You do wh at?) , You take - to keep the law away�� I'm going to tell you how to keep the law away, too. You know this stuff they call cayenne red pepper, and you know spice, and tab le salt wh at you put in your food. Well, you mix them three things to­gether: spice , table salt and cayenne red pepper - three things, mix them to­gether. And jes' like if the law have passed your door - you catch him sometime , catch any one of them. You don't have to get the name. Just c atch air [any] one of them and you take that cayenne pepper- don't let 'em see you doing it - you got to do t�t so they won 't see you. But , if they 'd see, y ou might as well not be doing nuthin, you see . You take that and you throw it over your left shoulder jes ' as they pass your place, and you throw it over your left shoulder. Even if - it would be more better f or you if they would come into yo ur home and you could catch 'em in there and just as if he be walking out , you stroll there be­hind.

Yellow corn me al . You take you some yellow corn meal and Ep som salts. You take that yellow corn meal and catch her when she is asleep. You see? You be sure now and watch dat she be asleep -don't you fix your ownself thataway. You watch her when she be sleeping, and let her urinate in the slop jar and take her urinate and that yellow corn meal, and you put it into a place - any kind of a bottle, it don't have to be black. You put it in any kind of a bot tle and put it under yo ur back step , see. She'll go out and buy whatsomever she got to buy , but for down here she won' t have no feelin ' to wo rry with nobody . She'll be just wishing for you to come on - to come on home . She 'll be true to you, you under­stand. (While - when he leaves home she will be true to him while he is gone.) She won't have her mind on nobody- couldn 't be no other m an could come there and hold her no kind of - see , that corn meal controls her down there and her water. Put it under your back steps, turn your bottle like that . (How do you turn it?) You see the neck of the bottle? Put it down in the ground. (I see. Put the neck of the bottle down.) Yes, sir. You put it down in the ground and you don't have to wo rry for no­body coming there worrying her and talking foolish. She ain't going to fool with no man, only yourself. I heard many people come around and say that. [While machine was stopped she evidently said something ab out menstPate (some-times called minustPation).] (When she menstpates? What about that?) Can put that in there -it' s the best in the world. (Do you put it in the bottle or a separate place?) Put in there with the corn meal- it 's the best in the world. (It 's better to use that menstpate rather than the urine?) It sure is - if you can get it . (You can take that out of the bottle, if you want to?) Yes, sir. After it dries , you can catch her menstPate. You see hit going to dry with that corn meal, and wh en it dry up in the corn meal , you know, just like if you wet corn meal, the water's still in there but it's just dry. Well , you see , that going to be still in there and it going to be dry. You can take it out from there then and take you a little bag about that big_, and fill it up full of, sew it up , put your silver dime in there and put it in your pocket [making a hand of it]. You got her in your pocket-don't worry about nobody else, you got her. (You can either leave it in the bottle or we ar it in your pocket, either way.) Either way you want it, it works. Get some -fixed it on scorpion or rattlesnake . But you got to catch the rattle snake. You got to take that rattlesnake and make it bite i tself. Jog him until he bite . He going to be biting at you but he go ing to miss you and bite hisself. And then you kill him right there , and when you kill him you catch his blood - not his rattles . You take his blood and you nuse that, you see, and you nuse that jes' like if ah come to your house and say, \"Give me a cup of coffee.\" Well, you got some of that rattlesnake blood. [End of A263 . A question almost always starts a new cylinder.] •(Now, what would you do with that?) Now, just like if I'm knock at your door.

Will you come in and have a cup of coffee?\" Now, that 's for you to get me right there . And I say , \"Yes , I surely would be glad\"-won't be thinking that you have evil to do me nuthin. I say, \"Yes , I"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"1636 -Memoirs of Alma Egan Hy att Foundation -certainly will have a cup of coffee.\" All right, then. Now, y ou fix the cups yourself.

Now, you wan�o tell me , \"I'll put a little sugar in there for you. \" But you have long fingernails, say , \"I'll put a little sugar in there.\" Se e, she puts a little sugar in there but under her nails - that rattlesnake dry blood is under her nails �d she drops it off in the coffee. And from the heat of that coffee - and when you drink it, it heats it up. It heats that blood right back up again and you drink it down in you. In from nine to ten days you got little young �attlesnakes growing up in you. It's the blood. You can [get rid of them] . (How can you get those snakes out, if you get them in you? Is there any way of getting them out?) Now, there w as a ole lady took a scorpion out of me. She went to a mare -ah couldn't, ah cain't pull up this sleeve . Ah kin show you the hole right now where the scorpion cut me. It was a long scorpion like that [demonstrates] - he was fixing to have little young scorpions, little young scorpions. (He was what?) He was fixing to hatch little young scorpions. So it drawed - she drawed it out with a simple thing . My old daddy - he daid and gone now - he asked her, he say , \"Will you show me and tell me what did you use so if any more of. my people in the home get hurted, ah know what to do . She was on her dying bed then, and I really believe she told the truth, because w hen you are dying you going to tell the truth. · (Did this happen here in New Orleans?) Yes , sir. (Oh , SIT right.) So, s he said, \"Well, what I did to take that scorpion away from y our girl, your d aughter Olivia- what I did to take it away.\" She went to a place they call Atgiers and they g ot some horses and things and mares, but you got to get a mare with colt - you know, she with a colt. (She is ca rrying a colt?) Yes, sir. And you cut that hair from right under her tail, and she goin' to put one of them hairs - two-three strands of them hairs, she going to tie it around here wheresomever that thing workin' at . She goin ' to tie it round there , and in about - anyhow, in three days times, that thing whut got in you going to begin to get sick, jes ' from that mare hair. You see, it going to begin to get sick and it going to draw a little hole there where he wants to come out from there -that mare hair running him out from there. And he going to come out from there, and that hair going to turn jis' as green as this here . (Just as green as that.) [She must have touched or pointed to something green she was wearing - scarf, sweater, coat.] Just as green as this, yes sir , where hit done drawed - jes ' a simple thing as a mare hair from under her tail. But you got to get it when she with a colt. If you don 't get it like that, you don ' t get rid of that. And they burns that. Just like if you go to the drug store and say , \"Give me some incense.\" You take that incense - now there's diff' rent kind of incense. There' s the incense for luck and there's the incense what's for bad luck. See , you burn that bad luck incense for that. (What do you do with th at photograph?) Put th at photograph , turn that photograph - ain't you done hear talk of hair grass , wire grass? (Wire grass?)"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -Wire grass . You take that and get you some wire grass off a grave. (Off a grave.) Off a grave. (Wire grass off a grave.) Off a grave. (All right.) [I finally end the exchange of words!] 1637 And you wrap that pitc hure up in that wire grass and a looking glass. Buy you a brand-new looking glass that you ain't never looked in yourself, you put that pitchure in there but let that pitchure be upside down. And when that pitchure be upside down in there, and her using it and going on; and what she want to do with it, it'll do the work. (I see, keep it in there.) Keep it in there for nine days straight and you'll see the difference - it'll do the work. (And she burns incense with that too, then?) You burns the bad luck incense with that. Jes' like if somebody done took your pitchure and you don't know they got your pi tchure, or else, jes' bring it to you like this. If you done give a girl-friend your pitchure, and you figure that she is doing somethin' with your pitchure, you take one of your other pit­chures right back and have that wire grass, and put it in a close corner and put St. Raymon d with it, with your pitchure, and talk to it. Ask him for to not let no harm or evil or animosity to come against you. What she done with that pit­chure, not let it work, and \"In the Name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Ghost.\" And throw your hands - just have your handkerchief to make it go more better - over your left shoulder ni ne times [demonstrates]. And if she is doing anything, that going to pass away - it gon'a die, die right down and do nuthin. But you got to start in them thfngs in time. (You make this motion back over your left shoulder nine times?) Yes, sir. Now, you see, me and you - ever'body a-walkin'. We got our thoughts, you know. It's spirit comes to us and talks into us - just like, you done have some mind, somethin' come into yo u and tell you get up and go on such-and-such a place. You get there, and you have done got no more than such-and-such a place, when the mind come to you, well, that's the spirit talkin' to you. If you wants to do a heap of things, the spirit will come in to you to do, you be going right to be starting them things on time. You see, the Lord, He don't leave nobody no food. If you ever - ah'm been truly born to starve. Myself, I'm careful. He don't leave you no food. If the spirit goes with you -you got three spirits, you got a evil spirit and you got a good spirit. (How many more spirits? Evil and good, and what's the third spirit?) And the th ird s pirit is - ah done forgot what it is [guardian angel?], but three spirits follow you. (Three spirits follow you, I see.) Three spirits follow you - the good spirit and the evil. They say that it's the evil spirit, but anyhow ah knows the good spirit must be following. Well, now I have seen that done. I have seen that did with my own eyes and I know that to be true. If you read the papers of about twenty years ago, a Negro ki!led a man they called Wesley. (Westly?) His name was Westley. They was looking for him. He had got away and they was looking for him. You put - you take gunpowder and garlic, they say and - the blood ho unds was on your trail - put that gunpowder in your tracks as you run. You stop and the first track you make, take a chance and stop and put that gun-"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"1638 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -powder with that garlic. You see, that garlic is [like] assafitadee [asafetida]. You know what [it] is assafitadee does. Well, they got that [garlic?] dry - it 's dry just like a powder. You put that in that track . It goin' to make 'em hounds lose trail of you , and you ain't goin ' to go from water. [Stay near water.] You got to cross water. And when you cross t he water, you throw all of it behind you . You'll see them dogs clean off your trail - they don't smell your track no more, they just smells that stuff and they's got [ c onfused] and they d on 't know which way to go. If he killed someone , sure you can make him come back - if you know his name. If you don't know his name , you cain't make him come back . And it's a simp le little thing. If you have chickens in the yard and they lay, you take you a hen aig- take two, and put [one] in each hand [of t he murdered person] . Write his [murderer's] name on it and put that corpse on its face - lay it out on its face with them eggs in its hand. And when them eggs break, that man or woman, or who­somever done the murder, goin' to come right back to that same spot and the ·law goin' to get 'em. They got many of them like that right there in the pa rish prison right now in jail - goin' to send them up the road or somewhere. Ah don't know they goin ' to send them, but there's many of them done done that. No longer than week before last there was a man caught like that -killed a woman's daughter. (Just put the eggs in the hands and put the name on each?) Put the name on with a' indelicate pencil. You get a kind of little thing in the drug store looks like a brand-new - you know that black pepper you have to grind , it looks like that [Guinea pepper or paradise seed-see p.570f.] (Like the big round peppers?) Yes , sir. (Black pepper.) But it ain' t no pepper. They call it something else. Ah done forgot what they call it but ah know it when ah see it . You gets that and just like if you going to walk up to the boss man. You walk up to him and you tell him good morn­ing or good evening - wh atsomever the hour that you come there. See , now, you chew them seeds and spit. Spit one over your shoulder and one time over your shoulder going in - just as you into the building , y ou spit over your shoulder and spit in front of you. Now, when you get up to him, you going to say, \"Ah come for a job.\" He going to tell you , \"Well , I'll see.\" He is going to study a long time and the first time you catch him a-going with his head turned, you spit again - spit over your shoulder and spit down in front of you , and he 'll come back and he 'll tell you, \"Well , you come back here tomorrow.\" And when you go back tomorrow, he' ll look you over. Hit won't be in his intention to fire somebody else and put you on, but by you using them seeds and the Holy Ghost 's name with it, that' ll jus t turn his mind right to you first thing. First thing it 'll reveal to his mind will be, \"I 'm going to take him . I am going to fire so­and-so and [or] so-and-so - ah done have him a pretty good while . Ah goin ' to fire him and take him -it look like he more bet ter to me .\" That's go in' to be talking into him and he 'll take its word. (You have to go back three da ys?) Yes, sir.• And he'll take you to work the last day. It makes confusion in the home, I know. (How do they do that?) You beats that up and puts black pepper and red pepper and salt with it . (In this mud dauber's nest.) Yes, sir, in them old stinging wasps nest. And then some of them make them"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1639 nests of the dirt daubers, just make them nests . You done see wasps nests.

(Cause confusion in the house.) Yes, sir. They take that and they walk into your home, and they'll have it in a little handkerchief or something- it ain't going to do them nuth in [no harm]. They take that just like if they come to your home and say , well, \"How are you?\" But it don't take long for strangers to do you that - it takes your close friends to get to you. They come in your home and say, \"How you feeling?\" And you say, \"Well, I'm feeling all right.\" They say, \"Oh , ah sure is warm.\" You see, they pass that handkerchief on their face but still and all they got that little stuff in there and they going to do like that [flips an imaginary handkerchief] . They got it in your house - all over. And whensomever your family going to come in or what, it ain't goin' to be no fun - nuthin you do can satisfy them. There'll come confusion -breaking up dishes and all, just get rid of things . He won 't know whats the matter with him. It's that stuff done run him like that. They can stop a person from drinkin' if he is a purty [good] drinker. (How do they do that?) You take a catfish and catch it -[or else] jes' go to the market and buy a fresh catfish and split his tail three times, and it's goin' bound to be - you get -well , anyhow, you gets about four or three drops of blood by splitting his tail. You see . And jes ' be - take that blood and you have you a little clean handkerchief - going to let your handkerchief be clean so that blood can drop on that. If that blood dries on there, it's all right. Now you get what a person who has been drinkin' likes to drink -loves to drink. Well, you get with him and you want to break him from drinkin '. Always keep that handkerchief in a cl ean place so you can get to them parties and you get him to drinkin'. Now, them three or four drops of blood what's on that handkerchief, you just take that handkerchief middleways wheresomever that blood is at and - don't let them see it, 'cause if they see you, they won't drink 'cause they'll see it's something right there ; and you won't have to tell them nuthin , they'll see that. You jes' take that handkerchief and you hold that handkerchief like that, right where that blood is at, and you catch 'em all from not looking at you and you drop that handkerchief down in there [liquor] , and let it in there and take it up before they can see you. And after you do that , throw that handkerchief away. You see , now they goin ' to go home - they ain't goin ' to get sick and die or nuthin. They going to get sick from drinkin' t hat stuff - just one glass of it. And the next time you offer them some or they goin ' to a place and see you drinkin', they'll cuss and it 'll just turn up their stomach - they don't want it, they don't want to see it. See, that catfish blood is against drinkin' and it makes' them sick. That's a hoodOo. You see, them books will teach you more than I could. Right at mah home ah kin do dat. (I see .

And the minute that candle go out, you kin feel relief -you feels yourself without hurtin'. The minute you cross dem straws, that hurtin ' would go away. Dey don't want chew to die, but dey just goin' to fix you in a condition you be on this earth and you ain't nuthin . They catch y ou - they goes to the toilet, anywhere where you goes, just like out in the country. You know they ain't got toilets like they got here. Well, they goes out there in the c ountry and they watch you when you goes to the toilet , and they go there and they get some of your, not your urine, your mess what you mess, and they take and they stop it up in a dime tin bucket and bury it at the root of a tree. Well , that 's going to cause you - your bowels going to get like they're locked . Sometimes you can go and sometimes you can 't. First thing you know, they going to commence to hurting you , and from hurting you it going to grow a knot , and that's going to be nuthin but a knot of your own mess going into you . And it jes ' go like that in little ball until it grow up meat around there, jes' by you can't make your passing , 'cause they got it stopped up in that tree. First thing you know you have a big old stomach just with you stopped up. It'll just continue like that until you die. Or if the doctors operate on you- they' ll operate on you and cut you , they'll find that piece of meat in there with that mess or hair. I�ve done seen people operated on have big ole ball hair in 'em from that - after this hoodoo is on them, a nd the doctor cut 'em for somethin' else and it 'll jes ' kill ' e m, you �· It kills many people. They cut on 'em for somethin' else and they hoodooed to death . (I see , I see. The doctors can't cure them.) The doctor can 't cure you , you see . It takes a lot of hoodoo first, or else if you know the things to do . And it 's a simple little thing , if you is really hoodooed and everything, and ain 't been hoodooed too long that will work. You take you a silver dime and you grate that silver dime - g rate it up . Just like if you been hurt for two days , w ell you grate that silver dime up and some garlic and sweet milk and just drink it on down -if you been hoodooed for two days, not going on to the three ; b ut if you been hoodooed for two days, you grate that up and drink that. That milk going to co me up just as green , green , green as grass . Well , that show where they had somethin ' in your stomach. It comes out choo then. (End of 780.) COUSIN OF JULIUS P.

Even so, a few came, excused themselves and did not return - somewhere I mention t he doctors in Norfolk and Charleston. He, informant, is also one of several persons confirming the purpose why I was among them -to write a book (see also p.l290, title quotation). Julius P. Caesar was named for a white man, not the Roman dictator Caius (or Gaius) Julius Caesar. Informant's material is on cylinders A356:1 -A361:2 = 1172-1177.] (Well , now, supposing they burn this black candle against me - just what would be the ceremony involved?) Well, now, I'd have to recite, relate the foundation of hoodooism to get to that. It's a p retty long story. Now, for instance, if I were King of the Hoodoos like my cousin was for 30 years - he was King of the Hoodoos. We'd call all our co-workers which would be 13 - 12 co-workers with him would make 13 . We'd go to work and surround all the skulls - we may have 6 or 7 dead-folk skulls out of the graveyard -and we'd have in those skulls, why, we'd have all those skulls lined up all the way around [in a circle]. He dresses himself in a big red gown. (Your cousin?) Yeah, dresses himself in a big red gown. And everybody goes around, walk around there [circles the skulls] 13 times. And when they walk around there 13 times -everybody's setting their mind direct on one thing, now. They are all setting their mind direct on that most partic'lar thing. And in doing that the re will be a light will appear in there. (Be what?) Be a light will appear in there. (A light will appear in the skull?) Yeah, the light will appear. [For smoke from skull, see p.282, No. 819; for power from skull, p .283, No. 820.] .And the first skull that's on the end, and when that light appear in that skull, y ou got your answer. That's be the most partic'lar remedy for that. Now, even as such, at de hoodoo ball, wish to have 'em make a carnival -every carnival they have a hoodoo ball, you know, on ca rnival night.

(How' d they go?) He [informant's cousin] sings a song . [Informant, who is speaking , then begins to sing.] (My transcriber notates that he is singing \"in French?\" She me ans Creole, though her question mark shows uncertainty. But on my checking the cylinder all I could hear was a sing-song succession of syllables.] [My informant resumes speech.] And as he'd be singing that song , you know, he'd be walking. [My notation here and made at the time reads:] (\"He danced around the room.\") [The informant danced.] And then we 'd all be around him singing that song , as he walk around. [He demonstrates .] (He' d walk back and forth.) And round and round. Everybody be dancing , you know, dancing around. Then after while when we'd sing , the whole building would shake - she'll vibrate, she 'd shake. Well , everybody that made their wish -the people in there make diff' rent wishes for diff'rent things . They'd go on home and they'd accomplish their wish . (I see. Well, now, do they have that ball any more?) Do they have it now? Well, now. Well, ah -there isn't but two of us ever know anything about that ball . (What was - was your cousin born in this state?) Well, no , he from Richmond, Virginia. (Oh, he 's from Richmond, Virginia. I see.) Richmond, V irginia. He was the top hoodoo in this city . He left ab out $150, 000 worth of real estate when he died. Now, here' s another thing what happened to him , which isn' t much, but. (What was his name?) Caesar . (Caesar? What was his last name?) J. P. Caesar - Julius P. Caesar. Well, I stayed in that house fifteen years. (I see.) Now, he has a secretary. I want to tell you the story about the secretary to show you what happened, as much as he knew. She had been working there four years. W ell , they had become intimate - that was his girl friend. She used to take the rags off and put 'em up on the top of the safe and leave 'em dry - you know , quite naturally it dry up there. And he always had to have a pork chop at each meal. Well, she 'd jus t take it, you know, and scrape some of it in there - y ou know, put some of the dust in there. He eat that and finally, while he was eating that, he was going plumb nuts about her. Sometimes he wouldn't go home to his family and stay. So finall y , he told a lady one day , he says, \"Why, hell, there 's something going on wrong around here, we got to clean up.\" He say, \"The re' s something wrong.\" So finally his eyes had • taken so, he went on to the Charity Hospital and - they have a good many white folks believe in that, he was colored and he was well known there -and they treated his eyes and everything . So, he went up to a fortuneteller and this fortuneteller told him that, \"The girl is feeding you on something .\" He came on back and he called me and another colored man upstairs and he said, \"I want you all to get on your job . There's something going on around here and I want"},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1643 you all to watch Julie while she is cooking - watch her close .\" Well, when I would be around there, I'd go back behind the toilet or else go out by the rail­road track and lay down and peek through the fence. So, finally one day we set a trap for her. We went on back out there -I and Joe - laid down looking through the fence like that. So he went on upstairs and she had put the meat on . When she got up on the chair and reached up on the old country safe and reached- we saw the rag , you know, that rag which she tie around, kind of long . We made it right around and caught her shaking it right in there, powder right into the. Here's what happened. He fires her and she stays away 14 months and he sent for her. That's how much a tendency , that the effect is supposed to have on him . (Now , you learned your work from your cousin? ) From my co usin. (Well, now, after you learned your work , did he initiate you in any particular way? Was there any sort of ceremony or initiation or what?) Oh , yeah - oh , yeah. (What did they do when they performed the ceremony? They don't do that any more, do they?) [The second question is leading, but it did not matter - I being a little un­cert ain about some of his testimony.] Well , n o. That 's the last hoodoo of all our old people . Me and Miss Murray was talking about it yesterday. That the last hoodoo of all our old [some­thing?]. Now, when the firm is ag reed up on one of the co-workers, why they 'll have a chicken, what you might call g�ee-gree out of - fixed up with tomatoes, macaroni, raisins. You know these raisin what you eat, kind of a raisin-like , a little small thing comes from Central America . (From grapes?) Yeah , looks like a grape , yeah . (Dried grapes?) Yeah , yeah. And they take that and they mix all that. That 's g�ee-g�ee -you know, it's a mixture and they mix all that up together. Mix all that up to­gether and they'll put that table - set that table right out there . Then when­somever that person -he takes a book and he reads a ceremony to 'em, and when she swears that she'll n ever divulge any secret of the hoodooism, why then they swears her in. And sometimes they ask them this question -wh ether they want the good side or the bad side , whether they want to deal with t he ast�az pZane or deal with Luci[e� �o�k. The re1s two sides to everything. Well, you'll find a good many of 'em will say, \"Well , I want to do the devil's work.\" Well, after they start to marching around, they call Lucifer. (And he comes?) Yeah . Now, whensomever he comes, he come with a chain. You can hear that chain - l ook like he's coming - I don 't know where [whether] he's coming but you hear that chain. When that chain come, well, then they all sit right down there and eat and drink and have a good time , sing these different hoodoo songs , and eat and drink. (Did your cousin have an altar in his place of business?) No , no altar . • (How did he conduct - now suppose you give me this example. Suppose your cous in were alive and I came over to consult him ab out something . What would be the ceremony they -the procedure I'd have to go through?) Well, if you'd come in , \"How you do , Do�.\" Well, Do�, I came over here to see you ab out I'm having some trouble with my old lady and she won't stay there, she' s running around, and I really love her and I don't want to quit her and I"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"1644 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -don't want to kill her . I wants to break that .\" All right. Soon as he tell you, \"All right,\" why he might say, \"Why, it will cost you $25.15.\" They always carry that 15¢ you know . If his fee is $50, the 15¢ must come out . (Why?) Well , that's a key- that'd be a key, that 15¢. And I never did get in the 15¢ key , myself, even. But if it was $100, it would be $100.15. You see . And he 'd tell you, \"All right . Why , hell, yes , we going to fix you up.\" All right. [He demonstrates.] Take her name and write it down seven times and he 'd turn it to the east and he'd write your name down - make you write your name down over it seven times. And he'd take it, turn it to the east and fold it that way , turn the other part -the other fo ur corners - fold it that way , turn that part ' till it strike the four corners . Then you would take that and put oil of Lorraine[?] in it . Oil of Lorraine, that costs about $5.00 a ounce . (Oil of Lurren?) Lorraine, Lureen. (How do you spell that?) Well , I just don't know. (All right, go ahead.) You take that oil of Lureen and you would drop seven drops of that oil of Lureen on that, and take it up , and you wrap it 21 times with wh ite silk thread and make seven knots in it [demonstrates] . (And as you do that, you wrap it toward you, just as you were doing it there .) [He is acting out everything he does ; sometimes with explanations, other times in pure pantomine. I conunent along the way.] Ya -yeah , wrap just like that 21 times and you take it and you make seven knots in it. And after you make those seven knots in it, why you take it and place it on the altar [demonstrates]. (Right here where this picture is .) Yeah, that would be the altar right there. This would be his real place of business, where all his secret work go on . That would be the outer door and whensomever you'd get in there you done consult him, and you go on direct in here to do business. Now, you take that and you place it on the altar . You take � green candle, one white, and one red. Now you take you, in front of that, in front of this altar , you ta ke you - right in front of the altar , you make your stand right up in front of the altar . There's the red candle , there's the white right in the center, and there 's the green . (Now, wait a minute! The red candle is at one side of the altar , at the right side of the altar ; the white's in the middle.) And the green over here. (And the green at the left hand side of the altar . All right.) The green's on the left-hand side . And you stand right up there and you take out three drops of this oil of tureen and rub it and make your wish. [He demonstrates.] (Wait! You drop three drops of that oil of tureen on your head and you rub it like that, and you rub it on your face.) Yeah, just rub it on your face [continues]. (Over yourJ>ody .) Your body and everything. And take temple incense out of that small little jar -just let , drop it - you take it and seal down in there - a little pinch of it - you open it up and just - three times. (Take three pinChes of it.) Three pinches - you can take that afterward, after you light it. And after you light it , why just go all 'round him praying [demonstrates]."},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conj uration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -(You w�k around him. ) Walk all around him seven times .

And you tell him to hold his mind direct on her , and his main desire - what he wants , h old his mind direct on her. And that's smoking like that - s moking good. (You make a circle and hold this little lid [of temple-incense jar] down , and making circles, you walk around him seven times.) Yeah, yeah. And after you do that , you take him and make him stand on his tiptoe s, like that [demonstrates]. (He stands on his tiptoes.) And he 'll give you his hand like this . He 'll be just turning round like that to his right. He's jest be going 'round like that [demonstrates] . (I see . Oh , you circle him around .) Tum him around just like that . And he stops and turns back like that and you ask him how he feels , \"Oh , I feel pretty good.\" Well, that's supposed to work from ten to twelve days . (That will settle up the [my] wife question?) That will settle that wife question. (I see. Well, now , tell me how was the room decorated? Anything particular?) Well , he have all different saints. He might have St. Peter, St. Michael , Lady o f Perpetual Help , St. Anthony , Jesus Christ , the sweet Virgin Mary . He have all those saints around there and he have all kind of - every one of your client come in, they going to bring you a nice fl ower and you beautify that with flowers. (The altar?) The altar. And you keep a light [taper in oil] continually burning on that altar from one year to another. (What kind of a light would that be?) Well, you keep a pure white light going all the time . Now , when he leaves at night, round nine or ten o'clock , he sets a pure white light. (That burns all night long?) Burns all night long. (Does he himself wear any particular garments?) Well, he wears -you might say he wears a seal, which he makes up there him­self. I had the book at home on seals once - one of the seals, but I . (Pardon me , but I meant , did he wear ordinary clothing wh en doing this type of wo rk?) Well , he wears the clothing -each month yo 're born in, that [book?] tells you just what you should wear - whether you should wear diamonds or sapphires or just what you should wear . But the most of his clothes was blue clothes. (Well, sometimes they wear robes , don 't they?) [A leading question, but it no lo nger made much difference.] Well , he had robes wh en he was at his altar . (Oh , I see.) When he's using his altar , he 's got his robe on . • (I see . What kind of a robe would that be?) That 's a black robe. (That 's a black robe. Does he wear a hat or any thing?) No. Wears a cap on the order of a hindu cap [a turban] . (What color is that?) That's green."},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"1646 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -(Oh , that's green.) And the night they going to have the performance , that is, to make some of the co-workers, then he dresses all in red, from head to feet. Then everybody bare­feeted. Everybody be barefeeted at the hoodoo ball. (Well, now why are there only 13 in this band? Was that the only band in existence or is this one band among other bands?) Well, why we have 13 in that band , when we get rid of seven of them, there are seven more co-workers , waiting to come in the band. Now , you might take the queen of the hoodoos. She might have , say 15 of 'em up there of a carnival night. She was in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] . Well, she 'd bring them down. You get the idea? And there'd always be 13 at the time . See, there might be 40 or 50 of 'em going to be made there - may be some from Chicago or different places of that kind. Well, they make seven at the time. Well, after they'd make that seven or eight , they'd just add on and make 13 more and they'd go ahead round -that way it only about , say ab out 25 minutes or half an hour to make the co­workers. (Did you ever hear of a man called Doctor Buzzard?) [This was bait to bring out any workers he had heard about. It didn ' t work, but I would try again, later.] I' ve heard of him . (I met a fellow called Doctor Buzzard, but I don't know whether he was the original Doctor Buzzard. [He was not .] You've heard of North and South Carolina?) I've heard of hit, yeah. (He came from over there.) I -ah - we had a fellow - a preacher walking round here was supposed to be his brother, a preacher supposed to be his brother. (Doctor Buzzard?) Supposed to be his brother . (Do those people do hoodoo work , too? Some do and others don't?) That's the idea- you grasp the idea- some do and some don't. Now , there is some of 'em deal direct with nothing but the Bible. Then, they got some of 'em do clairvoyant work , or all that kind of stuff. They make hands, you know, � you up a little bag, and put some cayenne pepper and different stuff in there and tell you to go ahead and wear it, why you going to have luck. Then they got some of ' em actually can fix a hand up with a Zucky bean , so it has a tendency to make a man go ahead and have luck. That's the way that's worked. Now , in the healing service , when they opening up at night to go on through the real ceremony at a church . After they get through with that healing service , well, they line up all the co-workers . They line up all round there . They al­ways have what you call twelve disciples, just as Jesus Christ had . They line up around their mother and they line up around their mother, why, they'd si ng hymns, you know, and after they'd get through singing that hymn lining up there , then she 'd say to 'em then, she 'd say to 'em, \"Whosomever have pain about their body , come in the heaUng aircZe.\" It's a circle . Well, they'd all get in there and just -the co-workers would get 'round 'em like that [demonstrates]. (Rub down.) Rub that o� 'em - yeah , rub down. They'd go in the middle of their back -cast it off, cast it off, like that. [With each downward stroke , the hand is cast away, casting away the pain.] (I see.)

I just couldn't hardly walk when I got here , but the pain has l eft me now.\" Then another fellow will get up and say , \"Well, I had a pain in the knees • \" Another fellow get up and say, ''My stomach was hurting me and the pain done left.\" Well, after that, they take up the real collection. They pass a basket round and pi ck up the little pennies and dimes and go back there and empty it all in the holy water. And after they emp ty it in the holy water and get through with that, then they pr ay over it and bless that money. Then they coming out to broadcast - that is, to tell fortunes. Well, they'll line up around there -all get in a line like that, and they 'll just sing a hymn. [He sings the hymn himself.] Then, somebody out there in the public will take to moaning after while. �. the spirit's going in 'em and they'll walk - walk around, walk around like that. They're looking around like that , with that other fellow over there singing , you know. [Then she, the leader says ,] \"Have you got a sister named Dinah , .Q.!. Louise, or Sadie in the other world?\" Well, n aturally , I didn't hear no names and I may have somebody who passed out by the name of Mary Jones , and you say, \"Yes. \" \"Well,\" she says to us, \"you better be very good, and she got something she want to tell you- she's looking out for you over yonder in the other world.\" Well, the next day , you coming. You come in the next day and you put the dollar in. Now, she will tell you a few words for nothing , and the next day you come and put that dollar in and get the whole thing . Well, I was to three or four and they couldn't tell me just straight. They going to call some different man done passed out or something of that kind. But some of 'em are good, will come right up to you and tell you , \"I get you . Have you got a brother named Andrew Mitchel? I see him far off. He's not dead -he seems to be far off in Texas . \" \"Gawd knows you 're telling the truth .11 And get that right on - some of 'em g ets that summons. She 's just telling 'em. \"And your brother is roaming around in trouble and you'll get a letter in three days.\" You get that letter in three days, too. Some of 'em gets that strong and some of 'em weak. Some are strong, they go right on through that -that the process they go through. Now, some of those co -workers , why they wouldn 't know as much as some of them e le t in to et u here [to see me , the author to get to this [room] to get something to eat . They don 't know as much as those people [waiting downstairs in the hotel lobby to see author] but they dress in that uniform, you know. They get nice white robe and everything and they come on out there . But they got more evil than t he fellow out there on the street , that's hustling gin and going on -there more evil existing in that class of people. That 's the way that work out. (Well, you say that [here in New Orleans] the old-time hoodoo doctors are passing away?) Well, I want to tell you. Doatol' Mareene[?] • • [Transcriber calls her Mareene everywhere instead of Marie (Laveau) .] (Who? Was she an old-time?) Old-time . (Wait a minute now.) Marie Laveau [see p.794] lived down in the French part of town.

That why all t he young girls went to her when she were living . She's supposed to have a graveyard of her own. And when she was dying , she was about two years. Somebody come to her and say, ''Marie, you going dead.\" She just suffered, she just laid there and suffered, and - why she looked just like a monkey. My cousin went and saw her and said, \"It's a shame.\" And that's the way she passed away. But if she come - if you went to her and she told you - if you went to her for a law - for instance, if you went to her for a lawsuit case, or if a f ellow had killed another person, and you'd go to her and tell her , \"Well, my brother done kilt a man and he killed him in cold-blooded murder and I want to find out what can be done about it,\" she say , \"Well, you got to go out to St. Roc, St. Roc graveyard.\" (Where' s that?) That 's downtown , the St. Roc graveyard. (Is that the old graveyard?) That's the old graveyard. (That little chapel near there? ) No, that little chapel named after St. Roc, but St. Roc graveyard is down near - about 25 blocks from here. I been to it a couple of times . The most of the people go there. They got St. Roc's picture up there and you see about five thousand crutches over there, what people going and pray in St. Roc's graveyard, and after they get through and after their prayers, why quite naturally they get right up and walk right out of the graveyard. That's the way - that the way St. Roc 's graveyard are handled. (You say she sent them there? What did she do about the law case?) Well, she 'd go there and make her wish in this most particular case. (This Marie?) Yeah, ye ah. She'd go and make her wish there -you there with her - and when you'd go on back out there, she'd quite naturally get the name of the judge, the district attorney whosomever he is , and she'd go ahead on back and she'd fix up a little bag and put it on you, or else she would get in with the police , give him ten or fifteen dollars , tell '1m, \"Now you get this to so-and-so-and-so.\" She was pretty well in with them. And theys go there and hand it to whosomever in jail, and he put that in there, and it wouldn't be nothing but mistrail , mis­trial, mistrial until it makes the judge just get mad and discharge it. The case never come up . (Didn't she have some fellow, a nephew or something , Marie?) Yeah , she had some nephews. (Didn't someone carry on her work or No, I don't know of anybody carrying used to be right in the house with her . man Louis was next to her. (What was his name? Louis what?) Louis - Louis. something of that sort?) on her work.

Well, I tell you how it would be fixed. I would explain to you and then you will have your judgment about it. See. The way to fix that house, like I would be in this room, and I would just have to move out -no one disagreeable with me, and neither the landlord, might be the next-door neighbors . Well, anyhow, we 'd get the move on, a nd I just would have to move out and you wouldn' t want no money. Well, I couldn't s tay in the house w ithout paying him . You wouldn't give me your property to live in without some kind of funds. Well, I would go to the grocery store , or would go to a hardware, or I may find nails into the home or something like that.

You' ve got a good house over there and you'd like for them to rent it. Well, they might go in there and they couldn't stay. Well , now, I would come along . We would get confused and no up setting or no back-rent or nothing. I'd just have to move. You'd see where I couldn' t stay, where I'd get up set and confused - I couldn 't stay. Well, I would take a second thought . I'd say, \"It 's something wrong about this house.\" I'd likes it and all but no mind for staying . The landlord's all right and everything. Well, I might get to looking around the house, see. Well, I'll understand it. You wouldn't understand it , your wife wouldn 't understand it . I would speak to you ab out those nails . You wouldn't wanta upset your prop­erty. You wouldn 't want to go to work and put out no expenses, or you might laugh at me and take it for fun . Well , I would go to the drug store, myself -this is myself. I would get a scrub or a wash fo r that house. You'd g et one box of lye - a box of lye -you'd move that vanity - open that box - open that vani­ty. You'd put a portion of that lye in there like tonight - in that co rner.

[She's pointing to the vanity and the four corners of the room in which we were sit ting .] (In the four corners of the room.) In the four corners of the room . Now, y ou wouldn't scrub it that night. You'd put enough water on that lye to dampen -you know, just to wet, damp it. It gets in the sockets and the holes, crosses into the four corners, starting rooting up the cPOss [spell someone put on the room or house]. The next morning you 'd get up and get you a bottle of ammonia. You 'd put lye into the ammonia, you'd get blueing and you'd put alcohol in it; you 'd put cinnamon, put spice . You put clove in there. Well , now, you'd start from that room on back or on front, wheresomever way the lead-out goes . Scrub it out-and-out. You have to do that your own personal self, o ut-and-out , and wash up with that lye and that dope and everything. Well, now, your mind -you light you a green light [candle] to St. Peter. Now , your mind would commence to gettin ' quartified. [I suggest quarti�ed = cut into four parts like the old-fashioned pie, or a log quartered, or the term may have been made up on the spur of the moment. ] He'd say, \"Well, how is everything now?11 You say, \"Well , things is getting kind of straight.\" He say, \"Well, you didn't take my [door] sills up ?\" You say, \"No, I didn't take your sills up , but I h ave a remedy that I think will work on it all right. I don't know how it is .\" Well, the main purpose is to uncross that house. Well , now, say that if you move out, somebody else will move in it. Somebody else will move it. Everyone come in , they just goes that much further. Well, now, you come to be lucky with the house . Well , that 's the way they cPOsses a house, that you can't rent it. (I see. Did you say it was the vanity -sort of a bureau or a chiffonier?) Yes , sir. You move that out, say out of the corner - you know, you gotta get to the corners.

Don't let it go down in your eyes; but you let the hydrant run on your head � right on there. Then you wash your face .

(Do you have to - in addition to putting the water on your head, you have to light some candles, t oo, d on't you?) No, no ! (To make those other c andles go out?) No , no ! (I see. You simply have to bathe before six o'clock because those other candles are lighted.) Yes . [My informant here uses an agile you , pretending I'm both victim and evil­doer. The latter lights the candle at six , twelve , and six; the former washes his head before six , before the candle is lighted- \"it can't stay lighted.\"] A black candle is not [so] dangerous as a red candle - no . To burn a black candle , you burns - you writes a person name nine times : 'cross straight and upside down, nine times ; three times up , three times 'cross and three times up­side down. Now , y ou get you a black candle. You write on that black candle [with pin or pencil -latter need not show] three times . That's twelve times, you see, the person name's wrote. You write the nine onto a paper - a ny kind of pape r-and you write three times onto the candle . That's twelve times . Now, you cut this ca ndle, the end off [demonstrates]. It 's like this is the stem [wick] , you cut that off. Then, you turns it upside and make a stem on there [the bottom] - cuts a portion off and you kin light i t. And you puts it on this name. [The name 9 times on a piece of paper is usually f lat in a dish, the can­dle is set on this paper \"to burn a candle on you , \" and various ingredients are put ab out the bottom of the candle.] Then you puts your cayenne pepper, put your [ordinary] vinegar. Then there 's a black vinegar in the drug store they calls vin-[I failed to understand the word, as did my transcriber later, who writes vin ••••• ] • (What?) Vin ••• •• [my transcriber again] . It's black as that coat you got. [I was evidently wearing a black suit.

[And my informant answers .] Vinaigpe - vinaigpe. [For these three words my transcriber writes vinaig. ] [Why is the vinegar black? I would guess a very dark French vinegar - wine of course, which would be blackish compared to the American apple vinegar.

(You said a red candle is worse than the black.) The red candle is worse than the black candle. (How do they handle that red candle?) Almost the same way. Yes , the red candle rules the black one. Well, St. Rita is a good saint , but St. Rita don't like a man. (Why?) Well, because she had a husband . She did everything in the world to please him -that husband - a kind affectionate wife and everything , but she never could please the husband. And if the husband says he didn't want bread , that [then] she'd have to cook rocks - wouldn't give her bread. Well, of course, that hard­ened her heart and feelings towards men, but she's good for women. And if I'm in love with a man, or another woman loves a man , she do's a portion of favors but not all the way through. (Well , how would you go to St. Rita, for what particular thing? Give me an example .) Well, you could go to her because y ou' re a man. She'd do all the favors in the world for you, just through kindness of her . But she gotta know if it's for me [a woman]. [She'll] do it for me. Like I would go to her and say, \"Well, my husband's such-and-such a thing and I want him to come home. I wants him to do such-and-such a thing towards home, or he is not affectionate towards home.\" She turns her back on that, she don 't wanta hear that. St. Expedite is a good saint. He's a quick saint , the minute saint. (What do you mean by that?) In three days he ' ll get a success. That 's if you go with all your heart and main and means what you say. St. Roc , he will do evil in this way. He will give flesh. (What do you mean?) If you wants - if you didn't have a wife , or you seen a lady you wanted, you wants her , you would go to him and ask him to give you this woman. You wants her just for your us e, so you'd just want to be with her - you don 't know if it' s to stay or not. Well, this woman might no t want you . She may want you but then she will prete nd she don't want you. That's to bear you off just to see how far , how deep you care for her, or what could she have you for or what could she get, or try you out maybe. She might love you better than you do her. Well, you ' d go to St. Roc. You would light a light, you'd make your wish and your desires , you 'd pay for your light. All right. You may go a week or you may go over a week. You'd get that desire, but St. Roc will take you -you promise him and you give him what you promise , he'll g ive you your desire . But he'll take the one that you love dearer than what the Lord does. He give flesh but he'll take flesh. (What do you mean , he'll take flesh?) Well, somebody will die . (Somebody in your house?) Why , sure - the one you love . (In exchange for this favor?) Yes sir . You take a�erson's shoe -that's if you wanta harm 1\\DD. You takes that -there 's a piece into the shoe, you take that piece clean out. You put you some lye in there , lye , and [sugar] cane syrup , cane syrup . Don't pour the syrup till it be lickrish [liquid] - a few drops into the lye . Lye eats anything . Lye eats anything you put it on. You puts - let it [insole] dry.

They'd put on that shoe. Their feet would begin to get sore . Something the matter with the feet - tender feet, can't walk far. Keep on , keep on and gradually , gradually their feet will commence to swelling up and it wi ll swell up until they can't wear that shoe no more.

Yes , sir, but you ' ll have to go to the graveyard yo urself. That's what they call the graveyard dirt. (What do they do with that?) Well , it's a bad powder, it makes confusion and evil spirits . You gets a June bug, you gets John de Conker root, you get John de Conker oi l. You gets a aontrol powder - aontrol pO/JJder -and then you kin get the aontrol liakrish [liquid] -it 's a green . In lickrish it's green and in the powder it's a brown. And they both is the same but it 's just a lickrish [and] the powder. And you get guinea seed. You get lodestone . You get lodestone - now there t hree kind of lodestones. You get the blaak lodestone like a stone aoal. Then you gets the white lodestone -it's like a root, it's almost like a ginger or John de Conker root, but it's a stone - it's the co lor of that stone . And you gets a luak pol.t)der. (Well , now, that's two lodestones -two stones . What's the other variety?) Well, they's another - a dust lodestone -like a powder, like gunpowder [in color}. And you puts a portion into - put it all together- a portion . Then , whatever perfume you like or wherever your mind leads you, you dresses it with this perfume - say, Jockey Club or Lucky Dog or Violet or White Rose, or any other kind of perfume your mind's on . You dresses this whole dope and then you puts it into a little sack or a little bag . Sew it up and then you takes and you gets you a piece of shammy, because shammy when you - s ay , you have to fe ed it. One rain don't make no arop and one bottle of mi lk don't raise no baby. So by you 'nointing it with that perfume , wh enever it gets dry -the powder that 's got it, take and anoint it. Well , the shammy, see , it'll be we t but it won't make no stains or nothing on the clothes. See . You sew it up and make a bag out of it. Well, that's for a gambling hand, or say a suaaess hand , if it's any business deal or anything like that. [She now prepares an elaborate sarub for business. Many kinds of sarubs will be found under BUSINESS, pp . 669-744 .] Get some red antses , many as you kin get.

Cover them up and then when you get 's where you going , take sug ar or syrup or honey to draw the ants out of the dirt. Like say, you would get some of those ants in that bottle . Well , you 'd stop them up , dirt and all . Now, say, like this table, you wouldn't be using this table . You would pour that portion of antses and the dirt in a pile , just pour it out up side down. Now , you would have this syrup, either some honey or sugar , off a distance from this dirt. Well then, when you get 'em into a lot, commence to mingling around, they can 't crawl out of the syrup and they can ' t crawl out of the honey, but they could crawl out of the sugar, but they wouldn 't - they'd go down into the sugar. You understand? Well, now, you could use the sugar and all. Just rake them into a bucket or can or something, whatever you are going to scrub with. Then you get you same white roees - white roses out of a garden. You could get you some codfish. You would boil that.

You would get you a bunch of thyme - that's what they uses for seasoning . You would get a bunch of green onions or two . You'd cut that up into that codfish whilst it's boiling . Make-a just a gumbo out of it. Now, yo u'd take a strainer and you would strain that. You wouldn 't want people to be passing around your place and saying , \"What is that?\" and \"What is that back in back?\" You would strain that into your bucket or your tub - what­somever you are going to fix you to scrub with . You'd get you a bunch of bay leaf -that grows on a tree in the woods, but they sells that in the market. And you'd put ab out a pound or two pounds of brown sugar ; brown sugar, not the white - the real brown cane sugar, it's damp-like . I know you mus t have seen some of it. [This is the old-fashioned brown sugar, raw sugar before it was refined to death and bleached pure white; brown sugar which in my boyhood and up to the First World War was sold everywhere in gPOae�y sto�es from a large barrel. Unl ike modern granulated brown sugar , which is almost tasteless, damp-like brown sugar had a sugar-cane taste - mildish maple to some.] You use that . After you use that - say that you got a business. Sunday is the best day in the year , in the month or in the year , of any a day is , to scrub for luck. Sunday . On a Sun­day , because in the Ten Commandments, Sunday is the first day of the week. Sat­urday is the Sabbath day, Saturday , but Sunday being the first day of the week, it's the luckiest of the year if anybody with a business is to scrub . And scrub at night - scrub at night. You can take your own time and your own mind, who­somever is scrubbing , and ain't got to wait to let this one pass and the other one pass. You go on through with your business. Well, just like you be success­ful in going on through with your business without stopping and chatting and talking and this one stopping you. That's where your success will come in. You understand? Like I was going out , leave here and go home , I'd go right on away through whatsomever I had to do - go to supper or whatsomever - well , I'm suc­cessful in my trip . But if I meet this one and stop a nd meet the other one and stop , you couldn't keep your business before you. You gets the law's name - you get their name , who ' s on the beat or who's got a tip-off on you. You gets a can of Karo Syrup, can of Karo Syrup , and you get you a bottle of honey. They say, \"What's sweeter than honey?\" It's love . You understand? Then you get you a dime of ammonia - a bottle . You pour that into a quart bottle - into a quart bottle . And like you got a private room or cellar or pantry, you puts that away back in a corner in the dark. Put that name over there, pour that honey on there . You pour that anmonia on there and you sets this three 'gredients (syrup , honey, ammonia], you sets it back into a corner ­a dark place . The law will pass there . You 'll have a fight out there in front of your place - not you, but your customers might get afighting . They see it all and don 't say anything ; they go on about their business. Somebody may go and report it - such-and-such a thing happened over there . \"Well, I don't never see no trouble over there.\" They'll keep away from the place . Well, now, you git a b eef tongue , a beef tongu e . You goes into a butcher shop on that morning before that [court] case. Say, like you gotta go in front of the judge nine or ten o'clock, you be in that butcher shop at four o'clock in the morning . Have all your other things there because the grocer and things is not open that early . You gotta always be at the head. (You have lo go down to the market -that's the big market?) Open all night. (I see . All right.) Yeah. You be's in there at four o'clock. You have your lights [candles] and you have your ice and have everything overnight. Now in the morning at four o'­clock you be in the market getting this beef tongue . You gets that beef tongue ,"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1657 the guzzle and all, just like it is. You get that - if the guzzle too long, cut a piece of that guzzle off. You gets a ice pick and you make a trench in that ice - a hole like a trench with the ice pick. Now, y ou set that ton gue level with that trench and just level it there - put it down into this i ce. There ain't nothing, but the ice what you took off of that, fallen off. Just gets the trench and level. Then you digs nine holes into this ice all around this tongue - nine of them. Put plain white candle s in them. (In those holes?) Yes, nine of them. Now you light them but don't burn them but two hours. You burn 'em two hours. If you light them at six, let them burn until eight. Now you going to court by ten or eleven. When you going out, you light them ag ain. You understand? Burn them two hours. And you g.ets - get the ice and dig them nine holes in there and you put the candles down in there. Now yo� put a littl e candle [melted wax] - let it drip down in there, kind of steady 'em and if that don't steady them, you have to get you a piece of paper or something to make a stand, you know , 'cause ice melts and of course that makes the hole sharp. But you gotta watch that - keep it or it'll set your house afire. (After those first c andles go out at the end of two hours, what do you do, get some more candles then?) Oh, no, no! You burns 'em when you in court. But don't get them little short ones. You get 'em about that long, see. You put the name of the judge. Find out your judge's name. If it's Section B or Section A, find out what Section he's in. You puts that under your ice. You understand, under your ice, and let it burn. If I'm a witness against you, or if you a witness against me, when the judge call your name, you'll answer him and when you get before him, y ou can't open up. (Why not?) Well, you're chilled - your tongue is chilled. Yeah, you name that tongue whatsomever this person what's prosecute against you. When you get that tongue in there you name that tongue. You say, \"Ida.\" That's me. You name 'em. Well, when the judge call my name, I can answer and go before him, but when I go to testify, I can't open my mouth - don't know what to say. Well, they'll tell you to set down; if you don't [know] nuthin, wha t you come there for. You git down and go. The case is dismissed. Two. Two, and when you get those two black-hen eggs, say like I'd be killed today, don't put them in my hands today. If they going to bury me tomorrow, to­morrow morning at six o'clock you put one in each hand and close my hands. And you close my hands - I'm going to the cemetery now and I'm holding evidence against him going to the grave. When you put them in my hands, you say what you put them in there for and make your wishes whatever you want done. And even if a man hasn't left town, he can't leave; but if he done left, he'll come back. I had a big Christm as dinner, a big Christmas dinner on some friends. There was two wine-head womens come along. (What kind of women?) Wine-head women. (Wine-head women?) �es, drunk women. They'd go anywhere for a drink. So my little daughters -one was twelve and one was fifteen - I had went and bought two overcoats for their Christmas, thirty dollars apiece on the installment plan. And one was a gray and one was a blue. So they had went o ut for a little w alk and their dad had brought ' em back in the truck for a little ride - he was still working, hadn't knocked off until twelve o'clock that day. Those wine-heads stopped and come back there looking for something to drink. I said, \"I haven't got anything"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"1658 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -to drink. We got some wine,\" I said , \"but what we got, that 's only for dinner,\" I said, \"because none of us here are no liquor haters ,\" I say, \"but we take a little drink on a holiday like, just eating, and my husband brought it in, \" I said , \"and I wouldn't go to work and give it out , dish it out and then go to set the table and not have a glass to serve .\" I said, \" It wouldn 't be right.\" \"Oh, we wants a drink , we' 11 pay for it.\" I say , \"Nope, go right across the street.\" Well, now, they had a piano in the hall and they started to playing and going on. They slipped in the room and took the blue coat - that was the biggest girl's - and when we got ready to go out later, after dinner, we looked for the coat. And the coat say, ''Look for me , look for me .\" I cried and I worried. I didn't enjoy my dinner. We went everywheres where we knowed they was , or where they went -tried to locate the coat and we couldn't locate the coat. So, that was at Christmas time . All right. I went to church - I goes to St. Anthony -went to church after leaving the store. I went to St. Anthony , I put a light and I made my wish and I p rayed. I went for nine days. I didn' t see no success or didn't get no success. I had success and didn't know it. There was the piano in the hall and there was a 'mode, old-time ' ammode [commode] , wardrobe. (Something like an old-fashioned cupboard?) Yes sir, into the hall and the piano was in the hall - standing, was standing at the piano one night talking . I saw something on the edge of the ' ammode, I know didn 't have no business up there cause I hadn't put nuthin up there. So the next morning it come to me . I got on a c hair, but I was too low. I couldn't see on top of it . I rolled the sewing machine out the room into the hall and got on the sewing machine and there was my child's coat. (Had they brought it back?) Brought it back. He 'll bring things back. (The going to St. Anthony nine times makes this a magic rite.] And he goes to a pasture where there's a mare horse. They carried a colt �lve months , a year -that's a year. A woman carries eight or nine months -seven months. I 'm a seven-month child, but my mother got hurt coming through a fence in the country. She hurt herself. I was horned at seven months - no fingernails, no hair on my head , carried me on a pillow for a year. You goes and you - say for instance if the horse is not tied on the pasture , becau se some horses in general , you know, you have to tie them. You goes on this pasture and you buy a rope, a small rope. Say if a horse is out there , well to leave her out there for almost time for her to co me in, or maybe the colt may be born in the pasture - that's country places. You ties a piece or rope around this mare 's neck, say for about a week or ab out a week and a half. Then you goes and unties it , if someone don't steal it off or unties it. The owner may take it off. But if they have luck enough that it ain't took off, they takes this rope off of this mare and they ties nine knots in that -that 's for the limit of carrying the bab� nine months. Then they'll tie one at the end , each end - that's eleven. Then, wheresomever this party be's or crosses , maybe it might be a step or stairway , they puts that rope cross there - under that step - and every time that woman crosses, it ties that cord around that baby's neck. She can 't have it unless the doctor takes it. (I see. H&w long will she carry it?) Eleven or twelve months. She can 't carry it that long overtime. [For pro­longed gestation caused by horse or mare, see FA CI , 2nd ed. , p.l32 , Nos . 2927-2930.] It will only be a few days overtime and they'll have to take it. (Oh , I see.) Yeah.

Like you'd get it and it wouldn 't be wh ite, you'd have to set it in the sun somewheres where it would dry and be white. Make a powder out of it. Then you put war powder in it. (War pouder?) Yeah, you puts fighting p owders and you would put moving powders. [Three ingredients.] And course anybody will see that if you throw it in front the door. You have to throw it the first part of the night and let it stay there all night . (Then what happens?) We ll they kill off one 'nother. That red onion, you load it with bluestone , cayenne pepper, dirt dauber [three ingredients] -that 's a wasp - makes a daub on a wall or a fence or board. It [the nest] be 's like a beehive -well that's dirt. You takes one of them [one cell from the ne st] and·you make a powder out of it. You loads this into this onion. You put this party's name - if it's one person you want be evil against, you put that one name ; if it 's two, for separation you put the two names. And [put] the onion under the dirt dauber [nest]. And just the way that wasp hums, wanders around, circles around, that's just the way those people mind will be. Then you takes and you put a white pepper -it 's just like the black pepper, but it's white - white pepper, a black pepper, and a pod of red pepper that grows on a bush like a finger. [Three ingredients .] Open that and get the seeds out if and you put the hull and all in there. That piece what you cut off of that onion to get in to it , dig out, you put that navel back of this onion. (You put th is onion navel back in.) Back in - that's to hold the packing in , but you have to take a candle or either wax -blue wax - and you wax· that onion round and round before you puts that navel on . And put it on there wh ilst it dissolved. When you put it on the re it be wet but then it will dry out and it will never come out , unless you cut the onion or either hull it out again , cut it in half and hull that stuffing out. Now, you takes this onion, a black spool of No . 8 thread -not a white one, a black - and you wrap that thread , make a wh ole cover. While you are wrapping �' you are making your wish. You wrap that round like that, to you -to you, this way. You wrap un til you wraps - you may get tired. You rest up on the thread and you put it down. See, you fixing some other things or have some other case on hand . You take a recess on it. You go back to it and you wrap every bit of the thread offa the spool. It 's a hard task, but then they ain't filling the spools of th read as much now as they used to in the olden times . They don1t put as many yards on the spools as they used to . They cheats you on spools of thread �· And you wrap every bit of this thread on that one onion. Then you make a loop - leave enough space on that thread to make you three loops to tie that thread, keep it from working loose. You put that onion in a oven - the ap ron of the, at the oven - or [put it in] the ashes. You put it into the front of the stove or anything. You might not have a stove in the home, who the party of . You put it into a grate of the fire hearth, where the ashes falls.

And that onion, it only be the one layer around the hull, then the thread will hold the heat, hold the heat until it dries inside and it come to a perfect shaving - just'll dry up and wither . And that 's just the way the people be wan­dering away, even drying up and will never know what 's the matter with 'em. And finally it'll be nuthin but a carcass.

And afterwards, the thread'll commence breakin' -dry-baked- commence to breakin', and well, finally , it'll come to ashes . Well, then that's the end of it - that case. (How can a woman bring a man back who's left he r?) Well, a man can be - oh , say , can be anywheres in the world, anywheres in the world. First, there 's a trick you 'll play on him. Take his name - you write that name three times on a piece of canvas like a·bottom of a shoe, like the lining of the sole . You take that [inner] sole or that paper [inner sole] wh at that - put that name on canvas [inner sole] with an indelible pencil , not no lead pencil, and then you write it three times , three times straight up and down, eithe r to the feet [toes] or e�ther to the heel . You don't put the writin ' on the top, you turns it down to the shoe [you write on the bottom of the inner sole] , then you puts that piece of sole inside. It's a white piece [of paper or cardboard] or eithe r it be 's a piece of leather or oil [oil cloth] or something like tha t. Sometimes in a cheap shoe it's cotton. You put that back. (That inner sole.) Yes, sir. And put that back , but have that canvas in between with the name up side down [so that it will not be seen or the indelib le pencil stain the bot­tom of the socks or feet] . Then you we ar this shoe. Don't put nuthin on th at but the name , both shoes -three times in both shoes , that's six times. Put your name on the top [of the three names] one time , either straight up or either across. (How are those names written, those other names? His name is pointing to the heel or toe?) His name six times, your name once - th at on each feet [his name three times and yours once in each shoe] . And now you walking daily , and it may be the shoes you wear at night, nightly , or just a stationary sh oe . Keep it in there. And if you would change the shoes - if you are going out, putting on a different shoe -have to take it [inner sole ] out and transfer it and put it in that other shoe. That is to keep his - every t·ime he ' 11 walk, he 's right under your feet, the heat from your feet keeps his name hot. Now, you-it won't take no effect on you cause you know what you are doing; and you mind 's on him all the time, because you know what you are doing . Every time you walks he 's walking ne ar to you - or if it's a woman, it's the same , walking near to you. All right, you may get a letter or someone may come along and tell you they saw him - such-and-such a thing, here or there. Well , that's about fifteen or sixteen days. Now , you'll come and you 'll light a blue light [candle] . You keep that name in there [the shoe] . You light a blue light with his name three times, the same as the shoe. (What do you write that name on? ) On the candle [usually printed on by pin] , and you turn that candle and you rob the Zash of it [you rob it of the lash] . Take that lash [wick] off. A per� son go to a grocery store and buy a light or they go to a drug store and buy a light . That's not the way to burn a light , because the man that makes it or the woman that makes it , it 's made in a mold, and when they make it , they not making it for their own use , they making it for my use or your use or anybody else's use. Well, niw, it' s left to you to study your interest to burn this candle -what you burning it for. A candle that 's made for anybody , everybody -well, if you want to work on everybody in the world, my goodness, you have to spend all the money you get. But if you wants to work on one person, you make that special light. You know what you are doing and what you are lighting it for. You know what you are working for. You know what your desires is and you want the"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conj uration -Witchcraft - Rootwork -results. You gotta make your own lash. Cut . (Your own lash?) Your own lash . You cut that lash what they made - cut it clean off. (That's the wic k?) Yes sir. (The cord in the candle?) 1661 Yes sir -cut that clean off. Now, you use the bottom of the candle - you making your own lash . You cut it [remove the bottom] to a length that will catch a light from a match . And melt it to [at] the bottom. Put his name nine times on a paper, your name once. You light this light -now , hold your match under­neath and make a little melt. You stick it [candle] on to this paper. Then , your 'gradients is already in there - if you 'gradients ain't in there , you put your ' g radients in afterwards. The proper way is to put your 'gradients after you put the name. Put your 'gradients on the top . (What ingredients do you put there?) You use whatever 'gredient you like, but the right 'gredient that you use -we that's making it , you see , we use differ ent things. My opinion -your opin­ion -somebody else's opinion - is different opinions - and the best 'gradients is to use the quickest desires , the quickest wishes, the quickest revenges . [Here speaks the master craftsman, the real doator, not the sma ll-time prac­titioner who depends entirely upon a hoodoo manual.] You get you a pack of Bugler Tobacco . That 's a little slim package just about . (Is it chewing tobacco or smoking tobacco?) Chewing tobacco-no , smoking tobacco, moss-like [she me ans Spanish moss] . It's a little package, little red package with the bugler-man on it. That 's the quick est and you get quicker results out of it . You use a whole paCkage on a pink candle .

Or are you still doing the same thing to bring the man back? ) The same thing , yes. (You leave this blue candle burning?) Leave it off now , and you light you a pink candle now with this tobacco. (Oh , you don't -what ingredients do you put on that blue candle?) Well, if you want to put bay rum, you. (You can put anything you want?) Anything you want. (Well, what would you put around it, if you were doing that. What would be your choice?) If I were doing that, I would use Jockey Club [perfume], I would use bay rum, and I would use Lucky Dog [perfum e] . That 's thre e 'gradients. (In the saucer?) Yes, sir. (That's the way you would prepare the blue candle?) Or either a plate. (Or a plate - put this in a plate. That's for the blue candle. Do that with a blue candle. Now, you are going to prepare a pink candle, you say . ) 4With the tobacco . (With this Bugle , Bugler Tobacco . All right, now. Now what do you do?)

It's the less expensive but qu icker results. Some oil of cinnamon, you pour that round this light - right close around it. Now it going to melt all through this paper - it 'll go clean to the edge of this pan, circle around. All right. Now you pour you some , say half a pint of the b est whiskey, a half pint, and just as quick as you put that whiskey in there - th at's all that 's being used now, that and the pink candle, and the Sacred Heart.

I am commenting for my own benefit, not asking a question or making up the size.] Yes , sir, that's the Sacred Heart. Now, you tack it. (What kind of a saint do you put in there? What saint do you use?) The Sacred Heart. (Oh , the Sacred Heart saint . All right.) Yes, sir . You nail it about from there to the floor. (Where do you nail it?) Right into the wall.

You gets this tapestring and you'll have connection with this man -say two times - but you wouldn 't have to digree [agree] with him [have an orgasm]. Ketch him. If you will use a towel, you use that cord - course he could wipe on the towel , but you use the cord. The woman would use the cord, else [but] you [a man] would use the towel. And she'd have to ketch t hat ab out three times , and then the three times take that cord and stretches it open to dry out, and ties nine knots about that distance [demonstrates].

Now, you name this man t he man you working on , h is whole name. You puts that paper back down in the bottom of th at box on the dirt, worms and all. Not your name. Them worms will sip all that writing off. (What was th at last?) Sip it off. They'll sip it off and in them sipping that writing off, his name and his form, they's purgi ng him. Now , they gets all that - sip all that name off j ust as clean as a towel, or shirt you got on. There won't be nothing on there , not a speck of writing or nothing - just sip it off to a sifter [something full of holes]. This man'll come in feelin ' sick, be all but dead . But he ain 't going to die. He 'll confess to what's wrong, he 'll confess to what 's right. And he come home to die . He ain't g oing to die, he 's just alive. He's not going to die , he's done run till he can 't run no more. He 'll come home, he 'll be sick awhile, he 'll c ome to stay. Now, that's a simple thing as - that won't cost you a nickel because you always g ot a pencil [have a piece of paper and can dig worms]. He'll come home and he'll stay, because when he gets sick, feeling bad and ain't working , that other woman out there , she 's [only] got him for what she can get out of him . Her man got a job and he makes money and he brings it home, and this, that and the other , he's her man, her husband. Now, when he [victim] gets sick, she going to throw him out . He going to come home, at his home where he left a home. He going to come there and confess that he ' s wrong and every­thing else.

It's just like if a woman is after a man and the man is in that house there, and she trying to make a disturbance between him and -his wife and him, y ou see. If you bust that egg on there, it going to create disturbance. Or if you put it under the house, it going to be making disturbance until it do bust itself. They do that with a rotten egg. They kin use a chicken foot to -Doctor Lamson used a ch icken foot for the boy who had commit a crime in Missi ssippi, you see. He comm it a crime in Mississippi and the p eople came down - the other party - just like in my case, they came down and they was trying to get him back. So he told him to get me a black hen. Well he got the black hen and he'd taken the two foots and he'd taken the two foots and he cut 'em off and he crossed th em - you know, cut 'em off at the top there and he crossed them cross there, and he tied a thread on 'em and he wrapped them up in a linen paper with this boy's name on there nine times. And told him to go ahead and bury this chicken fo ots at the back door. Well, the boy was d� there at the time. Well, he stayed down there about thirty d ays. When he went on back intending to see his mother - and they trapped him there with the chicken foot there at the back steps. (What did this boy do over there?) He kilt a fellow over there. (He killed somebody?) And they guessed he camed over here, but they didn't know exactly where he was. And so after he. (What did he do first before he cu t t he feet off that black hen?) He ki lled the chi cken first before he cut those feet off that black hen. (He stabbed the Chicken.) The Chicken wasn't dead and was akickin' when he cut them legs off. (How do you spell his name?) Lamson - L-a-m-s-o-n. If you wanta make a person drift out of the city, you take their name and you write their name down nine times, and you take two needles and you cross them you see, and you wrap it up tight and you put it down in the toilet ho le, if yo u got a big city you see and it close to the river, and you flush that toilet. If it runs and they'll just go on - on like that water goes, run them out of town. You kin take a lemon and - go take a [lemon] and you squeeze all of the juice out of it, you see. Now, the lemon is for the spirits. You take salt and pepper and you put it in that lemon and you put - if it's a woman's name, Clarence John­son and the wife's name is Mayme Johnson, you put that in th at lemon and you stop that lemon and you throw it under the house. See, that more for creatin' a dis­turbance, you see, and stuff and just keep them aboiling up between the two people together. But you gotta have their name stopped up. But this onion here is when a woman has quit a man, you understand, and the woman, you don't want her, but you just want her to drag, you understand. Now, you take this onion and you wrap it up in a cloth with this woman's name on it, and you put two pins and stick them in that onion, and you boil that onion. You boil that onion until it gets soft, soft, soft. And after that onion gets soft, soft, soft, at night you take that onion and you take the juice, and you just take that jftice and you squeeze it - include with the paper and all. And after you squeeze it, throw it out in the street, you see , like this, but you gotta do it three times. And she will just - she will get around but she w ill never have no success. (How do you put those pins in that onion?) Oh, them pins is mostly cross her - that's to cross her. When you make th ose"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1675 two pins , you put them like a cross. Stick them in there to cross her, but you put her name down and you put that cross in there , you see. Just like the name is written like this, you put a pin like this and you put a pin like that with the name in there - just a�ssing her with the pins. To get you to move out of that house . Well, they'd sprinkle your house. They'd get some graveyard dirt. They 'd get some river sand and they'd get some red pepper and cut up , and get some war powder, see , mix with it, and sprinkle your door before day in the morning. And as you walk over it, it'll put you in straits - so bad luck that you won't be able to keep in your rent and the land­lord will put you out. (With a photograph you do what to get a what?) [He had said something about a photograph while machine turned off.] You take a pe rson's photograph and you take a cigar box and make you a little wooden coffin . Take and put that picture upside down in that coffin. Write that person's name on a piece of brown paper nine times . Put it there. Put the top on it and drive nine little nails in and carry it to the graveyard, and bury it on the shady side of the graveyard. And in the long run, that will kill 'em. (What do you mean by the shadYside of the graveyard?) The side where the sun is not shining • . If you wanta kill somebody - like you got it in for dis person and you wanta kill somebody , well you take and you write their name down and you burn black candles on it. You burn 'em for nine days straight . After den, they 'll go to gettin ' ill - gettin' sick and just pine away. White candles and blue candles, that's for luck and doing good; but black candles and red candles is for death and harm . (When you are going before the judge?) Why, like you got a case in court and you wanta go to the judge to get dis­charged. Well, y ou take and you get you a tub . You put you a piece of - a big piece of ice in it. You get you a beef tongue. You split it open . You write that judge's name down. You put it in that beef tongue . You sew it up and you get you a pan and set on - put that tongue on top of the ice and get you a pan or something and set on top of the ice and get you some blue candles or white candles. And you burn them before you go to court. As you light 'em, you make your wish. You take your underclothes, you changes 'um wrongsi de out; and you will put needles from your navel up as far as you kin get in your underclothes , straight 'cross, and go to court. I guarantee that the judge will dismiss you. (You mean you put these n eedles in a cross all the way up like this - just like buttons?) Yes , sir. (Well, now, what do you mean - you put that pan on the - you don't put any­thing on that tongue - just leave that tongue right there?) That tongue just on the ice and that pan there on the side of the tongue , with the candles on it . • BOY-GIRL OR GIRL-BOY I'M WHAT YOU CA LL A FREAK I GUESS YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE \"FIXED\" LIKE THAT NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA"},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"1676 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -[I knew informant 864 was a boy-giPZ only because my contact man Edward through our local m an Mack told me before bringing in him-her. The two hermaph­rodites I interviewed - the only two I ever met -were called boy-girZs, possibly because both wore slacks and pretended to be men . Remember, women at this date before World War II had not started wearing slacks publicly. The term girZ-boy I also heard, but whether this meant a dress-wearer I do not know. The second quotation deserves comment -the belief that he-she before birth had been fixed like that by hoodoo. Be it said to the credit of my unfortunate informant, God was not accused of sending the deformity as a punishment of the parents. The material is on cylinders A574:2-A580 :5 = 1390-1396.] I know two methods of doing th at . One of the methods is - take a fresh hen �· take the Holy Bible, take the twelve apostles name out of the Bible, write it on the egg, let it be on the first Friday of the month . Go to that person 's house midnight on that Friday night and break the egg and if it' s a man, you say, \"Go, go , go , \" and if it 's a woman , you say , \"Go , bitch , go.\" Now, the other method is - if it's a person in the house that you wanta move, you go to the graveyard at midnight on a Sunday night, you take some graveya:rd dirt off seven persons' grave. --(A seventh perso n's?) Anybody 's grave , it doesn ' t matter, and take it off of seven of 'ems grav e. (Oh , I see. ) And when you go there you take the dirt and you get some l odestone and cayenne pepper and some bull manure [3 ingredients], and you mix it all up and dry it out -that's on a Sunday night. Then on the com ing Friday night you go to this person 's house and you throw it down on that property , place of business or what­ever it is, and you get inside that business and you put some down, and you put some cockroach down inside the house, and they'll leave the house and v acate the premises within nine days . (I see. You put some copper in there, you say?) Cockerel. (You mean like a [copper] pan?) No, cockerel what you get dogs - you know, that kind. (Cokerels. Oh, all right , I unders tand.) [I understand it was copp eras , but my trans criber always had trouble with the word. So did I at time when it was called aopas and j ust ab out everything pos­sible . The dog-test question was useful.] You wants a tenant with this house? (I want some body to rent my house, yes.) Now , why I come to know all these things - I know you are curious how I come to know, being such a young fellow , but I 'm 25 years old and my grandmother was a spiPituaUst woman. (I see.) Now , you have a vacant house and you wants to rent it. You want to rent it to a white person or colored person? It doesn't matter who you rent it to? (It doesn' t matter.) It doesn't matter. You take your house and scrub it out with cinnamon and sugar and sweet m ilk and burn three blue candles in the house at midnight and your house will be rented within twelve days . (I see . You don ' t burn those candles any special length of time or?) Any sp ecial -burn the candle unt il it's down. It's not like a candle you are burning on a person -you burn it awhile and you put it out and make y our wishes;"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"- Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1677 it's not that kind of candle. You just get three blue candles and burn them in the house until they burn down. (I see. I understand.) And the house will be rented within twelve d ays. (Does it make any difference whether I want to rent that to a colored person or a white person?) Yeah , it makes a diff're�ce . If you wanta rent it to a Negro, y ou should use a pink candle - just one pink candle. B ut if it's a white person, you should use three blue candles. (I see.) If you don't wanta move or you wanta fix it where no one else will rent the house? (Yes , OPOSS it up .) You wanta aross it up where no one else will rent t he house? (That's right.) You take sulphur and burn it and oil of lodestone. That 's the lodestone you buy at the drug store. I don't know what this lodestone is made out of , but my grandmother always used it. You take sulphur and a box of lye , a nd at the proper time that you moving out, sprinkle the house thoroughly, and burn the sulphur and close the windows up and the house will not be rented within six months . (I see. That's arossing up the landlord.) That's arossing up the landlord. And it's another method of arossing up the landlord. You should throw cayenne pepper in his backyard and drop a whole box of salt in the [outside] toilet. (That will do the same thing? ) Do the same thing. (Well now, if they wanted you to move and you didn' t want to move out, how could you stay in the house?) If you didn't want to move out of the house -whenever someone put anything down , just take a handful of flaxseed and throw it over whatever you -if you suspect anything has been put down you just take a handful of flaxseed and throw it over it and it will kill anything anybody else have put down for you to have you harmed with. (I see.) There are many way - methods of doing something when you go out to the forks of the road . Now, for instance , if you in love with a girl or if you wanta kill a woman. If you in they country - well , all country roads has forks to it. Well it's nothing for us saying people go out to the road to kill folks , but my gra nd­mother never did teach me that - to go out to the road to kill people. She always taught me to go out to the road before the sunrise in the morning and make the sign of the cross three times and. (Wait a minute ! You mean make it on yourself?) On yourself - just like this [demonstrates]. (All right. I understand , all right.) Make the sign of the cross three times before yourself and throw dirt over your shoulder -left side, th ree times and make a wish and your wish will be granted. • (Where did your grandmother do her work?) My grandmother does her work right in the city of New Orleans, on Drive between Natchez and Girard - i t's 611 Drive Street. (What was her name?) Her name was Henrietta Joseph. (I see . Was she called - known by any special name?)"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"1678 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -Madam Joseph. (Madam Joseph. I see.) That' s a way to protect yourself from anything people plant down for you to walk in, and if you walk in it, it means injury to yourself. You take saltpeter and sugar and crumble it up in your shoes and wear it in both shoes and no harm will befall from the evil that they have planted for yo u. I kin take the trim of your fingernails and get me a tin burning lamp - what I mean by tin, it 's a little brass-looking lamp that you get -and put it all in a pinch of your hair, and I could control you from the time that I b urn the lamp on you until the time I put the lamp out. (I see.) Put all that - take all that together and put it in the lamp and burn the lamp on you. Long as the lamp continues to bum I can control you - the whole time that that's burning. (I understand.) What I'm talking about - the dirt that you get off their heel. (Yes, that's it.) Yeah , that's another aontPOlling method. You kin take that method and tie it up and wear it around your waist and the person that you love, you can control them with that -by taking it all together and tying it up and wearing it around your waist continually. But do n't let anyone touch it. If anyone touches j_.t, it will become dead . Your foot tracks - it's five or six methods for that, but I only know one of 'em about taking your foot track mostly . You can take and scrape the dirt that's in the foot track. The foot track is made something like that, you can scrape the dirt that's in the foot track [demonstrates]. (From the toe back to the heel.) From the toe back to the heel -towards you. If you making the footprint thataway [demo nstrates] , scrape it back thisaway , and then you take the dirt that's in that and you burn it in a can, and take and wrap it up in a bag and throw it in the river , and that'll make you move out of that town. Just long as that bag continues to go, you go; when the bag stops and sinks in the river, you will stay in the town where the bag sinks at. (I see. You simply burn that in a can - an old can?) In a old can . I got hold of your chamber lye, you couldn 't have a heart to have intercourse with any one but me - whether it was a man or woman, either one. I could take it and wrap it up with cinnamon and oil of ammonia -that something like Jockey Club. You kin get it right here at the drug store - at the Crackerjack Drug Store . (What do you call that?) Jock-0-Day . (Jock-0-Day?) Not Jockey 0-Day , but Jock-0-Day [spells it] . (I see,) And you tie all of it up together and wear it -it's something you wears the corn off the foot- around the waist. You can't raise the heart to have inter­course with a. man or woman outside of myself. (I see. This Jock-0-Day is a perfume?) Jock-0-Day is a perfume. It smells continuously .

(What can you do with a photograph?) You can take a ph otograph if it's white or colored. If it's a white man, you can take his photograph and you can put it up some place if it's not a negative. If it's a negative, I can kill you with it -either one. You take the photograph and put it up - you put flowers around the photograph and you burns a pink candle , but before you burns the candle, you have to turn the candle bottomside upwards. Cut the right end off and sharpen the bottom end and then you write the man' s name nine times with a sharp-pointed needle-� times towards you on this candle , and then you roll it in honey and sulphur, E.,!!! towards you, and you set it up and burn it. And you can comm and the name of the picture to do what you wanta do. And when the picture is moving around the can­dle , the pe rson supposed to be thinking about you . The picture moves just like wind is shaking the picture. And when the candle burns completely down, the person will appear at your house that you desire to see. (Now, you have that - you just put that picture up?) Just like that gl ass there . (Put it up against the glass?) Yes. (You see anything?) Anything . (And put the candle before it?) Put the candle 'fore it. (The picture is face up?) Face up. (In normal position?) Normal position. (I see.) (You said, maybe you could kill a person . How would you do that?) Well, a negative - the negative of a picture before you draw the picture off. A little negative - something ma de out of tin . [Informant is speaking about a tintype.] You get this picture, turn it upside down in the cPease of the rainy side of the house - you know how the rain drip off the [eaves of a] house [and makes a little ditch which is called crease]. You bury it right in that cPease at least a halfa foot down. And when the rain washes all the paint off the neg­ative, the person will die. That's a true fact - I have committed that sin. [The preceding word cPease is a variety of the w ord crest. There is a crest, an ornamental ridging , of a roof; but this is the only time I have ever heard of cPease being the word, a descriptive one , for the ditch made in the ground by dripping eaves. The term is too good to be personal.] If you would write me a letter and you wouldn 't write me any more , I could take - if you a white person -I could take your handwriting and burn it under a white candle , and demanding you to write me again constantly, and you would write me for the next nine days . It's nothing to it but just take the white candle and all the letter and demanding you to write me until the next next nine days. (Suppose I was colored?) 'f you was colored, I would take a blue candle. (Burn a bl ue candle .) (You use white paper, then?) The same letter -just take the letter. (Oh, the same letter. I see. ) See, in some instances, if it's a Negro , you use a pink candle. [An example"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"1680 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -has already been given .] And in some instances , Negroes use a blue candle. (I see. I understand.) See, if you committed murder, when the person is in the coffin on the day of the death , you take and open up his hand and put a egg in his hand, and when the egg bursts, the person will appear to the court. And even, you could take the dead person and turn htm bottomside over and bury him on the face , and that will make the murderer give up. On the headboard, not the footboard . Iffen you kill a person and wants the person to appear, upon the headboard write that person 's name- on the headboard and watch the grave . The person will come to that person's grave. (You never did that?) Never have. [I ask ab out a graveyard rabbit.] That's not a rabbit. (Well, what is that?) That's a rabbit - t hat's a rat looks like -something like a possum , but only it gets smaller than a possum. You can take that and continues to keep it - if you kill it and take its heart out , it 's a good joomoo [or jomo] for gambling . (I see. And they call that a graveyard rabbit?) A graveyard rabbit. (I see. But it isn't a rabbi t?) No, it's not a rabbit. They take and take a bat - you know what a bat is. You take a bat and kill it and take the heart out of the bat, and stretch the hide out and dry it. And when the hide dry, y ou take the hide and chop it up -just like you would parsley , and you put the heart back in it and you feed it with oiZ of Zodestone and sew it in a leather bag and wear it around your left thigh, and you'll always be lucky and successful while you are gambling . But if you remove the bag off your thigh, your luck will be just as long as the next fellow's luck will be. [Even I the skeptic can agree that your luck will still be as long as the next fellow's. But informant means this hand is lucky no matter where you keep it.] One lesson that I know according to the moon - when a woman is become meni­stratin' - and when the moon is full most w omen menstrate. And you kin ketch the menstrate in a bottle, if you desire to kill the woman. And you bury the bottle upside down and when the moon grows to be an old moon and when the moon thining out and when a new moon coming in, well the top will come out of the bottle and the woman will die. The woman is sick all the time if you have this menstratin ' in the bottle. That's a novena you ask me for now. She's a household saint , she's not a evil saint at all . (Well, tell me something about her .) About St. Rita? Well, St. Rita, she was a holy saint and she always be' s, make your household lucky and successful. And whenever mishaps come on de house­hold, get you a fig-in the wintertime get a can of figs, because you kinnot find the figs on de tree in the winter. And put one fig in a dish and one where it in a row. In placin ' de fig in a row, then your wife and your children will always be happy and successful and healthy during the winter. And when those figs in that.row gets withery, refreshen them again and de household be's healthy and happy during the winter. ' When St. Rita died she had a sore in her forehead and before she died, she told the nuns, if they came to visit her, she says, \"Go to my co't in Belgium and bring me the rose. \" They said, \"St. Rita, there 's not a rose in no garden - it 's too c old.\" She said, \"Go look and find the rose that's in my garden.\" So they"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo -Conjuration -Witchcraft -Rootwork -1681 went to her rose bush and it was in full bloom with one rose on it. When they brought the rose back to her , she told them to go look in her orchard and bring her the figs off the tree. And they says , \"No , there's none in the wintertime.\" She said , \"Go look and bring the figs off the trees.\" And they went to her orchard and there was two figs upon the tree . And she died holding the figs in one hand and the rose in the other, and the sore that was in her forehead healed up and appeared as a star. (Can you tell me why St. Rita doesn 't like men?) I never heard that. She don't like womens - I've heard of that. [There being nothing to record, I turn to St. Expedite.] (Tell me about that .) St. Expedite? Well , you can go to St. Expedite and you kin -it's a prayer, I don't remember the prayer, but anyway I will see I get it and bring it to you some day if you desire it . I know a girl that has it. Well [informant recites a petition] , \"St. Expedite, don 't care for me. St. Expedite put her in hard luck. her past and her future, make her life miserable , make Expedite, I put all my trust in thee.\" the woman whom I desire St. Expedite do away with life unbearable . St. But you must says the prayer before you says those words . I know those words because I've read the prayer often to Expedite. [If those words are part of a prayer to a saint , they are pure hoodoo!] (And you burn any particular color candle?) It's no particular color candle , it's a candle come in a cup and burn to him. It's called a seven day aandZe and you light the candle while you saying the prayer. (I see. And St. Expedite doesn't like women?) Don't like women. [St. Peter ] supposed to open your home to you. Whenever you have a request to be granted, always go to his church and take a key and give it to St. Peter , and demand him to do so forth for you , and light a candle to him for nine days, and your request will be granted on the tenth day . (Ever heard of St. Anthony?) Yes , I heard of St. Anthony. I know a prayer to St. Anthony: \"O, St. Anthony, the mighty son of God, have mercy upon us , trust in us , open the gates of glory to us . 0, St. Anthony, deliver us out of this trouble . Deliver us into good health . 0, St. Anthony let the • • • nothing tempt me. 0, St. Anthony , bless me. Keep all danger and evils away from me . Please , St. Anthony, please, St. Anthony , I pray you.\" (I see.) [When a woman is] hustZin ' more, then you are constantly throwing white men, which most men have been thrown like that , whether [white] or not; if they haven't, they wiZZ be thrown. When you throw white men or colored men -doesn't matter 'bout the nationality - that is to cause you no fuss. You take the holy water after the last one out the door, you throw it and you say, \"Go - go - go -and don't come back,\" and sprinkle your house with holy water. Holy water will ns; permit the men of the law to enter the house. Holy water does not draw the laws - holy water keeps the law away. No men today in high positions can come where holy water is and do evil. (What do you mean by - when a hustling wcman is throwing a man.) It's throwing a man - just like you having intercourse with a woman - you jazzing a woman? And while you's jazzing this woman, some woman comes in the room and steals your money out of your pockets. Well, naturally , the first thing pop into your mind is the law. That's true . Then when you get up , you going to"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"1682 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -get the law. Someone throws the water on [you] and let the water touches you. And when you go out, well, naturally, you say, '�ell , I'm white and that's a nigger woman; I won't go back there with the law, because there would be too much publicity and scandal.\" (I see. I see.) If you bootleggin ', that'll [holy water will] keep the law away also. And if you have a trial to go to court, you take a piece of sage -you get the whole leaf sage, and you take that old Bible and you write all twelve of the Apostle's Creed names off - you have to have all twelve - not seven or not ten -you must have twelve. And you write the name on it [12 names on 1 sage leaf!] and you wear it in your right shoe . And you take the name of the judge and write it on a piece of parchment paper and you wear it in your left shoe, and when you go to court that morning your case will be put off. And the third time you go to court, your case will be thrown out . Nine day p()b)der. (Yes.) You buys the powder and you put it in anything they eating or drinking and when you gives them nine doses of it - it 's a dose each day - they 'll have no more desire and be dope addict at all, hasn't any desire for alcholic drink. (It stops all these?) All alcoholic or addicts - it breaks the habit of it. (I see. Doctor Goldberg puts .) Puts this powder out. (Is he a druggist?) He's a druggist. (He has a drug store here in town?) No, he hasn't one here in town , but his merchandise is sold in town - his merChandise is sold at the Crackerjack Drug Store. (Where is Doctor Goldberg 's place of business?) Doctor Goldberg is in Pennsylvania -Pittsburgh , Pa. (I see.) Like they- well, if you went in the drug store , it wouldn 't be polite to take and burn cinnamon and sugar around the house nor any kind of incense.. But if you hust ting now, I would advise you to use incense and sugar and sweet milk. Scrub in sweet milk, burn the incense and sugar and cinnamon all together at once. It's the incense they have in - the Catholic religion puts it out. Also the Catholic things might be of great interest to you. [Therefore informant con­tinues the subjects.] You kin also go there and get what you call Jerusatem incense. It has stars all upon the box - it looks something like a hot water contain er, something like t hat to put in your bed. It's a box from Jerusalem­not no make-out, it's really from Jerusalem. The Priest will tell you. You goes in there and you makes all your wishes and your wishes will be granted. And it's the incense they call charcoat incense -it's shaped just like an incense. If you should desire, I'd get you some before you leave and let you see it or either let you take it back with you. And you burn this incense on a Friday - it doesn't matter about which Friday of the month. And after you burn it, you make your wish knd be confident - have faith in yout wish. It will be granted and your business will pick up enormous. (Any kind of business at all?) Any kind of business, it doesn't matter. If the person is burning a candle, you would have to find the kind of candle they are burning and burn three like it on them, and their candle w ill go out they are burning .

It's more than one method now of putting out the candle, but that's my method. You may get some [something ] because they tooken away the black candle, but I only know that's one particular way of putting out because I have put them out myself . I've never he ard of crossing up a chile so she [mother] have a hard delivery, but I've heard of killing a baby before it's born. (How do you do that?) You take a herb , it's called anmonia herb . It 's a herb that grows in - any­body kin name the herb for you and show you the herb . You take the herb and make it into a tea or either coffee . You invite that particular person that 's in the family way and pregnant, I might say, with the child, and have them to drink some ; and if tqey don't get to drink any, have some cooked up in some kind of food that they might get the [essence] of that herb , and the baby will be born dead. [I ask ab out gunpowder -having ab ortion in mind.] I've used it but it's my own way of using gunpowder for luck . It's a Zucky piece you call Lucky Dwnas. You also buys that. And it's a -it's a platinum­looking, funny midget, and you �ake gunpowder with that and you tie it up con­stantly in a piece of sateen , not satin , and you rub s it and rub it until it wears the sateen -wears a hole in the sateen . And you shakes the gunpowder out and you takes the gunpowder that comes out and you put it in your shoes, and you' 11 be just as Zucky as gunpowder. (I see . Well, this [is] a little thin [image]?) Little image , yes. You put it in the sateen - make a little s ateen square out of it [add the gunpowder] and you'll just constantly rub it until it burns. Nat­urally , sateen ' ll burn through any kind of edge, but this [is] aluminum or plati­num-like see. And you rub it like that until it rubs like -put it between your two palms of the hand and rub it until it rubs a hole through i t. [Whether this friction would ignite the gunpowder, I do not know.] And then you shake the gun­powder out and wear it in both shoes and you '11 be just as Zucky as gunpowder. (And what ab out that? What did you say the name of that statue was?) Lucky Dumas. (Lucky Dumas? How do you spell Dwnas?) Dumas -D-u-m-a-s. (I see.) [I ask how your house can be protected while you are ab sent .] Sprinkle your house with holy water - to keep anyone from coming into your house at all -before you leaving. Most all of the Louisiana people have what you call a altar in their house. And whenever anyone is entering a house , they always light their light and sprin­kle the particular room with holy water, that they desire nothing to leave out of that room. And you kinnot do any kind of evil at all over holy water. Holy w:ter will not permit any kind of evil at all. (Y ou say most of these people have that altar. What do you mean , they Zight?) They light their altar and sprinkle their holy water in the most particular room that they have - and don't want the merchandise to leave out of that room. (Well , they blow out the candle before they leave?) �' they don't blow it out . I tell you , never blow the candle out -you"},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"1684 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -always pinches the candle out. (You mean to say they would leave those candles burning while they're gone?) [Only one candle.] Burning, because the candle is in a dish and there's no way for it set afire. Have you ever been to a Catholic Church and see the oandZe au.ps? Well, those are the kin d of cups that we have here. We have those same particular kind of cups. You can buy them out of the druggist or get in the store here [store selling Roman Catholic supplies]. (I see. There's no chance of fire.) No chance of fire. If you've been able to rent a house out to someone and the person get in the house and they don't want to move. You take a dirt dauber's nest. You take nine of them and you crush them up int o a powder. You take black pepper and cayenne-­pepper and go to that house and sprinkle it. They will be fussing and fighting in that house the whole time that the cayenne pepper's [and black pepper's] down and the dirt dauber's nest [three ingredients], until someone discovers it and scrubs it up. But if they should happen to scrub it - perha ps they won't see it beca use i t's such a small powder - you mash it into such a small powder. And perhaps they scrub it up. You put more down, and each time you put it down they will be fighting - and it doesn't matter how wealthy or how nice the people are, if you put it down, it's a sure sign of jail and a f ight. It's like if I commit a murder and you see me. Well, I just use your name­like, \"that Mr. Alfred Nichols there.\" I take a beef tongue - that's a cow -tongue's beef meat . You take and you split the tongue from the root toward you. You open the tongue and you write Mr. Alfred N�chols' name [on paper and put it] down in there - whatever name [the person] you saw - perhaps its you. And you write his name nine times -on a piece of white paper, if it was a white man; if it's colored man, like I 'fore told you, use pure brown paper. Use paper that hasn't been u sed in the past for anything at all, no more than you pressing it out. Because w hat he touching he don't know, but from the time that he buys it, he know what he touches it. And you write his name nine times and you put it in the beef tongue's head, and you stick nine needles in it. What I mean by nine needles [you stick] five one way and four the other. Make it have a cross -� angle [angle] like th at. And yo u bury this beef tongue right where the person can walk ov er it, and when the time comes for trial, this person will leave town rather than have anything to say about you, because that's what you call sewing up a person 's tongue, to keep them from telling what they saw and what they know. (I see. You put these needles and the pins like this.) [I demonstrate.] No, like this [demons trates]. (Like that?) Yes, you [demonstrates]. (You cross them -you make \"X' s\" - you keep putting them on top of each other, like making a series of \"X's\" on top of it.) Series of \"X ' s\" on top. For instance, if you have me arrested and you go like - you got me in jail already. Well I'm going to tell someone out of the jail, if I can get hold some­one at all, I'll have someo ne to do this for me. To go to the river and fish and ketch a fresh catfish, and you take and write your name nine times with blue ink, this time -l've also told you ab out the red ink, too. You take and write it with blue ink this time - n ine times. Y ou take cayenne pepper and you just rub it on this name on the paper and you say, \"This town is too goddam hot for you -go - go - go.\" And you take the live fish - you don't kill the fish - and you take the hook out of his mouth and you put this paper down into th e fish's belly."},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"- Ho odoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1685 Takes a good deal of time - but you can go through with it - to take a live fish and push this n ame on parchment down into h is stomach. And sew his mouth up. It's very terrible to do such thi ngs, although the fish w ill not die. You throw the fish into the water and don't look back and the person will leave town with the fish, because the fish wil l not stay t here after it has had it's mouth sewed up. It will go out into deep water to drown itself. It's a certain thing that the fish will not stay th ere after it has had it's mouth sewed up - it will go out into deep water to drown itself and the person will le ave there, u ntil the fish's dead body starts floating around and someone sees it and picks it up . (I see. You use this person's name - who put you in jail.) Who p ut you in jail. (You write it nine times just one over the other?) Just one here - doesn't matter what way you write it. Yo� take cayenne pepper and steel dust -you could also bu y th is steel dust. See, you also use the Lord's Name when you say \"goddam\" - that'll make the person get real angry with you and go. And you roll it up small as you possibly can get it and p uts it down past this fish's gills, beca use it will come out the fish's thare - see, the fish passes water through him here, and you puts it down into the fish stomach and then sew his m outh up with needle and thread. I could take a lemon and make�all of your toenails come off with it, or either your fingernails come off with it. I could take the lemon and take your toenails and fingernails and put them in this lemon and stir them into a mixture and let the lemon eat it up - for instance, try it sometime with a button. Lemon juice will even eat up a button. You can put lemon juice on a steel knife and it will eat it up. And you put lemon juic e on the fingernail or the toenail in a dish or a bottle, and when it eat it all up your fingernails and toenails will begin to have sores on them and they'll rot off. It's very queer but a lot of people goes through with those things. Take a a pple - and you kin take a fresh apple and carve a hole in it and write your name nine times - this time on parchme nt paper. You know parchment paper -real thin paper -used in Egypt - the Egyptians used to use that. You write Lhe name nine times on parchment paper and you sew it up in this apple and put the meat back in it and put it up over th is person's door - not under the door, any particular place th is person walk under. And as this apple dries up, this per­son will become sickly; and when this apple rots, the person will die. I t's a very hard task to go through, but it's very cr uel to do such of those things; but when we gets paid for it, why we does it. A hus tling �oman takes a onion. (Just a moment! What do you mean by a hus tling �oman?) [I wanted a better statemen t than the previous one.] I just told you about the hust ling �oman -a woman that's having each man she kin for a dollar, or two dollars or five dollars. (I see.) Just like you wanta jazz a woman. (I see. Well, you see, hust ling is a word -we don't �se it in New York. Thit 's a new word to me.). Well, what do you use there? (Sporting �oman. What do you say a sporting �oman is?) [I avoided a few old English terms.] A sporting �oman and hus tling �oman is the same thing, but we lower class of people use hust ling druther than to say sporting� because the smaller people out here, they are not educated. Some of them are educated and when you say sporting"},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"1686 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -woman, well they think that's something they going out to play golf or fishing or s omething. You see . (They do t hat for money?) Yeah , and you'd have to say a hustZing woman down here. But I' 11 just say sporting woman if you wish. [The attitude that I had criticized informant, surprised me momentarily .] (Oh , no! I want you to just - don't use - just use the ordinary words that you use right here - all of those.) Well, they use hustling woman, the words down here for sporting woman -what you call it in New York . (What do you mean by jazzing?) Ja zzing is fucking - see, they call it jazaing . Well, that's j ust a little -instead of saying fucking because that is so vulgar. So they say jaazing. Well , a jaaaing woman uses a onion. She takes one up over her door and she chops the other up and makes a small batter out of it and puts onions in it and sugar and holy water and she burns it in the oven. The holy water will soon dry out but the steam will be in the room and will make the room holy and lucky . And you can. (I see. That's to bring in trade to her?) That's to bring in trade for herself. (And she takes two onions, you say?} Two onions. (One over the door?) And it 'll grow. (It'll grow.) Yeah, just take one and stick it up on that nail up there . It'll grow while you in here . (I see . And the other onion she chops up and puts this mixture in it.) Yeah, and makes a batter with sugar . (Sort of a batter-like.) Batter-like and mix it like this and it will burn . It will make a terrible smoke, but she's got all the windows down while this smoke is burning and she 's got that window down, and when the room gets full of smoke, she opens all the windows and doors and lets the smoke go out, and then her trade will start coming in . (I see.) And you can use garlic for gambling . Whenever you going to get in a hand, you take garlic and rub it in the palm of the hand, see, when you go there . Now, if someone there hasn't got it on 'em already , and you knows they had it - if some­one there has this joomoo I told you about, you take a toadfrog when you go there and you put this toadfrog down. Well, that toadfrog stays there five minutes , then their joomoo is dead. Then you go out again and you take that toad/rag out and you bring your joomoo back there and your joomoo will be lucky joomoo and their doomoo will be dead. (I see. Did you say something about Joe or John or something?) That 's a frog. I said frog. [I was a-tually referring to joomoo, usually called jomo. ] (Yes. Well, I understand the story.) [I did not want any more hurt feelings !] You takes the frog and writes the name on parchment p aper again. This is the second time you use parchment paper. I've never told you about parchment paper but once. You take the parchment paper and you do with the frog the same way that you do with the fish, but only you perish the frog to death with the person"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"-Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork -1687 �· You put the person 's name in the frog 's mouth and sew it up and keep it chained up until the frog dies. And the person will die when the frog dies with the name. It's something like the apple , but all the apple roots and you perish the frog to death yourself. That's all. I' ve used the snake myself. (How do you prepare that?) You take the snake and you kill the snake, if it's a blacksnake - that's the only snake I know anything ab out is the black snake. You will the snake like yo would a human and you skin him and you take the person's hair- this time out of the mole [mold] of the head . The mole of the head is the knob of the head. I'm sure you know ab out that. And then you take and you put - y ou stuff this snake hide with this and then you go to a well that hasn't been used- a fresh well, and you throw this down in there - dip it in this fresh well water and you draw this bucket of water out. And you take this snake hide and stuff it in a bottle and put this water on it and that snake hide will rot in the bottle , and the person will die when the snake hide rots . Well , if you have a desire to put a snake in somebody. You take the snake egg and boil it �nd le t the person eat it. It 'll make it ha tch in 'em. It's no such thing it 'll kill 'em, the snake egg . You take two snake eggs. You eat a snake egg and the snake will be in you. And if you wanta ketch a person and put frogs in 'em. You know how frogs lays their eggs on the water. Didja ever see frog �? (I've seen frog eggs .) Well you take the frog eggs and you give them to ' em in some oyster cocktail -you know oyster cocktail is kinda sticky - either in some tapioca . Tapioca looks something like frog eggs . Well, they won't know tapio ca from the frog's eggs and they'll eat it and the frog's eggs will hatch , because once frog eggs gets inside you, they'll attach to your intestines and the more your intestines dry , the tighter the frog eggs will stick. Now, [ ALGIERS ] Louisiana IS MOSTLY A HOODOO TOWN (see p.745) . ALGIERS IS THE PLACE WHERE MOST OF THE WITCHES ARE because those people over there, they have enough money , b ut we out here , we don't have enough money . We just does anything we kin get money for. Anything we possibly can. Now, it 's some more ab out the witches. For instance , some people say it 's high blood pressure. But it's a lie - it 's really witches. Because you kin take a sifter and put it under the bed. It's the proper time - say, every night ab out ten o'clock , this witch come there. You may no t be home 'till ab out a quarter to ten and you'd get up and you put the sifter under the bed. Well, the witch come ab out ten or ten-thirty . If she get on you -instead of her getting on you, she going to say, \"What is this under this bed?\" Well t she going to go there and try to count all them holes. Now, what I mean by she done use that - she is afraid . Well, say for instance , say it might be a roach. If you ketch a roach in that sifter, you just kill that roach , and a couple of day s later you'll hear tell of Miss So-and-So or Mr . So-and-So died. Well, that was the person that go to bed every night concentrating on - \"To­night I'd like to go over to Johnny's and just ride -· just make him suffer in his sleep.\" You see , THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL CONCENTRATING . Well, your whole soul will be •on that when you go to sleep . Well , YOU JUST IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE OVER THERE AND REALLY YOU REALLY ARE OVER THERE. That be the truth . That's facts ab out that . That's no lie. Some pe ople say that's all lies , but that's not lie ab out it - it's the truth. You can concentrate on somebody that night and they will always do just what you say do . That's if they have a weak mind. But if they have a strong conscious, they very hard to control."},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"1688 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -And you get up in the morning and that bug will be in the sifter walking all the way round to all those holes. You 'll think it' ll be trying to get out, but it will be counting all those holes. And you get that and you kill it. In the next, two or three days , you'll hear tell of someone dying . If a man leaves home and you know he 's got another woman, and he won't stay at home at all . You take some charcoal - you take and beat the charcoal up . You take seven teaspoons of charcoal, five teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoonful of salt. Some woman - it 's going to strangle you, but you gotta go through with it, if you want it to come true . Y ou take and you make a fire o ut of it , just like you do in the furnace , and you walk around your bed seven times because you got seven spoons of charcoal in there. And you tell him, you say, \"Henry, p lease come home. Henry, p lease come home.\" And after you goes around the seventh time , you put it under the bed and you get in the bed, and the smoke wi ll fumi­gate the room and you'll just strangulate - drowsy - but you stay until it burns out . And then you take it and put it in your dresser drawer - a drawer that you don't never go in , and when he come home at night, you throw it out. But let it stay there until he gets in the bed. When he gets in the bed and goes to sleep, you get up a nd throw it out. You say , \"Please, Henry , stay home,\" and you throw it out after you say, \"Home.\" And anoth�r way of drawing a man home - like this. Now, I've been -I'm what you call a freak. I guess you know that , huh? I guess you know that? (You what? Oh , yes .) Well, another way to bring a man home is to take a pink candle, if your man is light skinned. You take a white and pink candle. You write his name nine times on it. and you put it on a glass of water, this time, and a glass of honey. You have half water and half honey. The honey's going to the bottom and water coming to the top . And you burn these cand les half on a Friday and you pinch 'em out. You don't never blow out a candle . As you burn the next half that Sunday. � it down 'till it gets to the water and the water covers the candles, and you make him come home when the water comes to the candles. And he will be just as sweet as honey. A man wants to keep his wife's mind constantly over him . Now , he take one of her menistratin' rags with him - keep it in his pocket , but it ain't any good if he don 't keep it in his pocket though. His wife's natu� won't be for anybody but him until he gets back. (Well now , what about your work - your personal work?) [He-she was said to do a little hoodoo doctoring but my question is misunder­stood. 1 Person work? Well, now, I had a man once upon a time -not onae upon a time -that's a story -doesn't say once upon a time . I was going with a fellow one time and he was very mean to me . I was staying right here in this room - this is No. 17. Ask Mr. Patterson didn't I stay here. [Patterson managed the hotel, the Patterson Hotel.] This was a little dago, and I had his picture . So I went to my grandmother and I explained everything to her - all my people knew what I was . So then she took me in her confidence and she told me how to use this picture to bring him back. Well , I brought this boy back. And it was so hard to make this boy give me money. The boy wouldn 't give me no money. He was making plenty money as a bartender. All kind of nationalities down here - Portuguese , Spanish, Italians - all of us mixed in together as one down here. Well, you are fixed [by hoodoo] like that . And so this boy wouldn 't give me no money, so my grandmother told me. She says, \"You get him to give you a dollar.\" So this boy gave me a silver dollar. His name was Salvador C.

I was paying the rent my own self, cause he wasn't giving me no money at all. So he gave me this silver dollar and I give it to my grandmother. She say, \"Come here, \" she say , \"I 'm going to take this file.\" She took a hand file and g rated this dollar down to one side . She took a teaspoon of milk and put it in with that and took some cigarette ashes off one of the cigarette butts that he was smoking and throwed down. And she says, \"Now, here, y ou put this in your lamp.\" I had a little lamp as I've told you ab out -a little tin lamp . And she s ays, \"Bum this and as long as you bum it - if there's anything you ask him for, he' ll give to you.\" But I say , \"Grandma, \" I said , ''but he ' ll see that lamp burning all the time and wonder why I bum it.\" She say, ''Well, bum it when he ' s not there and when he come, put it out.\" So I say, \"Oh, no, grandma, I don't want a bum the lamp.\" She say , \"Well , I tell you wh at to do -when he come home tonight , ask him for a dime . \" And so when Salvador came home, I said, \"Salvador, g ive me a dime.\" He gave , me a dime.

That was three years �. And so she says, \"Now you give him that dime back and tell him to go by the store and bring you five cents salt and five cents washing powder.\" And when he went to the store and brought it to me - she said, ''When he come back y ou open the washing powder and waste it , and have him to pick it up .\" And I say, \"Oh, Salvador, pick it up for me while I go in the bathroom.\" And he picked it up for me . And she says , ''Now, anything you ask him for, he' 11 give it to you.\" And right now, anything I ask Salvador for, he 'll give it to me right now. (Do you still go with him?) I still go with him.

She didn't know nuthin 'bout dat. So when she came down heah -'er he came down heah, says he goin ' send 'er some money de minute he leave - yo' know, soon as he git some money made. Well, he wus heah three long months when he hadn 't sent 'er one penny , a n' she had six head of children an ' dey all of 'em wus undah age - couldn't work tuh help her one bit an' she couldn 't git out tub do anything .

And after while he told John to get all his garments washed clean, he was gon'a sold him. And he [John] never could change his [Mastah's] mind. So a fellow says to him, he says, \"You go down and see a fellah they call Cunjure Joe,\" says, \"and ah think Cunjure Joe will do you a little good.\" (Cunjure Joe?) Cunjure Joe . So he goes on down to Cunjure Joe and says to him, says, \"Joe, I want you to do me a little job for me.\" He says, \"All right.\" He says, ''What is it?\" He says, \"I'm go ing to be sold and I ca n't change the M astah' s mind ••• I been pray in' go in' on 33 days and haven't changed his mind yet.\" He says, '�ell, you bring me two hams a nd a peck of sweet potatoes and I will change your boss's mind.\" So he said he w ould change his mind.

He said, ''Now, after you get it, I want you to get his sock •.•• \" (Sock?) \"Get this dirt from the grave and a sock.\" And he had taken dis and he car­ried it to - wrote Ole Boss's name on a paper and put it in dis sock and throws it overboard. When the tide come in [and] it went out, why that changed his mind. So the next morning, he come out there, he says to him, he says, \"John, I had it in my mind to sell you but I won't sell you •••• I come to find you is a good fellow and you is a nice worker, so I'm go ing to keep you.\" So Ole John went to tellin' people from then on - said that if you want a j ob did, he said to go see Cunjure Joe .

Now dese ridges - now 'long in de daytime he rests pretty well; but at night, de time she have her rages. [Why the alligator moved about in the woman only at night , I do not ask in­formant. But he does say the ridges of the reptile 's hide caused the rages .] Well, she got dere in de afternoon. Now, de day befo' dis woman got dere to 'im - come - he tole me about it. In de afternoon he 'd laid down an ' taken a nap of sleep . An' de day befo' dis woman even come, he tole me dat she wus goin ' be dere.

Ah asked him-yo' know, children is very 'quisitive - ah said, \"Grandfather, how yo ' kin tell dat people 's comin' an' yo ' ain 't nevah seed dem befo'?\" He say, \"Well , �·\" says , \"dat 's a gift from God.\" He says , \"Ah sees dat.\" Ah say, \"How yo ' see dat fur off - two or three hunderd miles?\" He says, \"Well, ah sees de individual .\" He says , \"Dat wus gived tuh me.\" He"},{"pageNumber":817,"pageContent":"1742 - Memoirs of Alma Egan Hyatt Foundation -�· 11Dat 's de secret part of a man. 11 An' he sa id, \"Befo' ah dies ah 'm goin' give it tub yo'.\" He said, \"Whatevah yo' do,\" says, \"don't give it away. 11 He says, \"Co'se, ah don't figure dat chew'll evah treasure it,\" said, ''but it will do yo' good in de future.\" He said, \"But if yo' should take a notion to give it away\" -he says, \" co'se ah know yo' won't give it away - but if yo' should take a notion tub give it away, an' won't treasure it, i t's wuth somepin.\" He said, \"It is wuth thousands an' thousands of dollahs.\" He said, \"When ah wus takin' mah first step in witchcraft,\" he say, \"ah didn't have a dime.\" He said, \"But n ow ah got aplenty.\" He says, \"Ah gi ts mah powah from above. \" [The purpose of the preceding financial talk is quite obvious.] An' so ah wus goin' tell yo' 'bout de woman wit de alligator. Now, she came dat next day. An' dey brought her dere on stretchers an' befo' she come he wus drinkin' a cup of coffee by de fireside. He looked up at de ole clock - one dem ole-f ashioned clocks yo' see, tickin' slow. He says, \"Well, in about seven min­utes from now ah' 11 have company,\" he says, \"Rachel [so;ebOdy] , her husband an' her two sons will be heah.\" He say, \"She on stretchers in de wagon -dey drivin' a ole ox.\" Ah looked at 'im. An' so in about thirty minutes ah looked down de road an' ah seed dem coming but ah didn't know who it wus yo' know. Ah didn't give it a thought, but ah jes' looked yo' know. An' so atter while dey drive up an' hailed him. He says, \"Yes, yo' all like tuh been too la te.\" Says, \"Bring ole Rachel on in an' see whut Jones kin do fo' her.\" So in dey come. [The doatoP's greeting, \"Yes, yo'all like tub been too late,\" is st andard consultation technique -see p.307f. Somewhere I call it scare-hell-out-of-them technique. ] So dey put her in de bed, yo' know, an' so he had everybody tub 'scuse de [excuse themselves from the] room but me. So he stripped her an' so yo' could jes' look up an' down her side. Yo' couldn't see nuthin but yo' could jes' see her skin movin' - kinda like -up an' down her side. Den it would stop an' when­evah it did stop why she'd be quiet. An' when it move like dat yo' could hear her two or three blocks screamin'. Well, he goes tub work den an' he has some oil. It wusn't zactly oil whut chew could po' but it wus between - it jes' would drop yo' know - jes' kinda lak a salve but it a bottle, y o' know, or somepin like dat - like tallow. If yo' put it by de fire hit wo uld dissolve jes' enough fo' yo' tuh git it like dat where yo' could rub it like dat an' grease yo' all ovah. Well, he got some of dat . Well, he had a little man - it wus in a bottle ah guess about lak dat. (A littl e what?) A little man. (A little man?) A little man. (Like a little figure of a man?) In a bottle, yes sir. An' at times dis man would be black as sut, a n' at times he be jes' as bright as de mawnin' star. An' so he tole me tub give it to him. He jes' set it up anywhere. He said dat wus his bodyguard.

Yes, dat's whut he called - it wus his gardybard [sort of Spoonerism for body­guard] he said. · An' so he'd taken dis bottle an' give it tub her, but when he give it tub her, dis fellah wus jes' as white as anything yo' evah seen.

So he 'd taken it back an' set it up on de shelf an' Uwus black right on . [The preceding bottle is an interesting example of bottle divination (see BALLS EIGHTEEN, p.l66), used here to diagnose whether or not the patient is triaked. Since the old man calls this bottle his bodyguard, he considers it a companion , a Jaak (see JACK, p.l90f.). Informant does n ot tell everything about the bottle. You will remember that grandfather \"had a little ball an ' he had somepin black dat he put ovah it ••• an ' he tuk it off\" (p . l739) . Now here is what could have happened. Grandfather put in patient 's hand a small cylindrical bottle containing a clean fluid in wh ich the figure of a diminuative man, pure white, f loated . He laid a black cloth over the woman's hand and bottle. He may have held both in his hands, praying over them. Then he lifts the bottle from the woman's hand, not removing the black clo th , but carefully wrapping up the bottle in the black cloth . He lays this bundle on the table, takes out his watch , timing something . Finally he unfolds the black cloth . Instead of the wh ite man and clear liquid, the bottle now contains a black man and a dirty liquid. This meant that someone had triaked the woman. I t also means to us that the woman had been triaked twice , the last time by DoatoP Jones. Here is the old two-bottle triak (see BOTTLE SUBSTITUTION , p.265f.). What a bout the room turning dark? A little addition by informant . The dark room , possible only if electricity were available , would not have increased patient's faith . Few things and simp le things are best .] So she says , \"Well, DoatoP Jones , whut is mah trouble?\" He say , \"Well, '\"'SiSter, yo ' j es ' been tri aked.\" She say, \"Well, how it happen? \" Well, he tole her it wus worked de same l ike de lizard wus worked dat ah 'fore tole yo ' jes' now. See, ah'm jes' tellin' yo ' personally whut ah knowed 'cause it growed in me , 'cause ah wus right dere an ' seen it all. Ah had tub wait on him after he'd passed 100 - he lived tuh be 104.

An' so he tole me dat dis woman -yo ' know dem little 'gaters when dey first born dey like dat, chew know- little bitta things [demonstrates], yo' know, when dey first hatch.

(Well , tell me something ab out old Doctor Buzzard . ) [See DOCTOR BUZZARD, pp . 891-905 .] Ole Doctor Buzzard, well, Doctor Buzzard wus all right father top him .

(How long has he been dead?) but ah seen mah grand-Oh , he died 'long in '28 or '27 -somewhere back in dere. (Didn't somebody carry on his work -his son or his daughter or something?) Yes sir, but ah think dey up de country now - d own in New York . But mah grandfather wus stronger den Doator Buzzard . Dey had a dispute one time ab out de cattle -yo ' know , y o' seen a line fence . Ah 'll tell yo' dat . Jes' lak yo' got a farm ovah heah an ' ah got one ovah heah , an ' yo' cattle git in mah farm -understand , an ' dere come a dispute. Well, dey got in a argument. Now, Doator Buzzard he had a walkin' cane - course it might seem like a story but it's not . Mah father -grandfather had a walkin ' cane an' Doator Buzzard had one . [Doator Jones' walking aane now becomes Aaron 's rod (Ex.7:9-12).] Well, dey got in a argument right at mah grandfather 's house an ' so Doctor Buzzard , he cuss mah grandfather. Well, m ah grandfather wouldn ' t cuss him , but mah grand­father tole him , say, \"Well, me [my] young man,\" says, \"ah won ' t cuss yo '.\" He said, \"But dis one thing ah kin say.

So mah grandfather chunked his 'n out dere an' it turned to a snake , an ' mah grandfather's snake killed Doctor Buzzard 's snake . An ' so after den dey shook han ' s an ' come tuh be friends .

So de white man says, \"Well , as wise as yo' is , dat 's wort ' hund 'ed dollahs.\" [Wise is a lingering vestige of wise man-see INTRODUCTION .] An' mah grandfather tole him , says , ''Well , is yo 1 got confidence in me?\" He say, \"Yes sir. Ah don't know nuthin bettah dat chew kin do fo ' me no mo ' den jes ' fix it where ah kin ketch dis fellah.\" An' he tole right where tuh go git him . Dis fellah had stole dese cattles.

So mah daddy [grandfather!] made a hund 'ed dollahs offa dat in less time den ten minutes . So he went on back an' captured dis fellah. An ' so ah 've seen mah fa theP [grandfather ] give han 's fo ' gamblin' . (How would he do that?) Well, now, hit's 'cardin ' tuh whut size hand yo ' want an ' how strong yo ' want it. He didn't sell none at no less den $15, an' if yo ' wanted a big one it would cos t yo' $50 or $75 or $100 - ' cardin ' tuh whut kinda gambler. If yo ' wus a big gambler, why yo 'd git a big hand an ' he would make it stronger . Ah've sit down an' fix all dat fo ' him . (Well, tell me about fixing the small hand-or the big hand.) Now, de small hand, he would always use dis heah -git somepin look like a part of charcoal. Ah guess yo' know whut dat i�. It looked like charcoal but it ain't. Yo' know whut it is . (What?

Dat's one thing in pa'tic'lar he would always keep de lock an ' key on dat . He had him a little chest - ah reckon jes' about de size of dat radio ovah dere. He would keep dat locked up all de time . So when anybody come dere fo' a hand, why he would always run de cards on 'em. Run de de ck of cards an ' read de cards an' put dat nightwood oiZ ovah dere hand an' rub it jes' so it would be thoroughly clean, an' den he would look in dat ball .

Den he goes tuh work den an ' put his nightwood oil on it, an ' den yo ' ain't supposed tuh put chure hand on it. An' den yo ' take a fellah dat gambles an ' be out all de time at night , it 's quite natural de law goin ' rnn up on yo ' somewhere an' likely search chew anr-put dere han ' on it.

Now, in takin' de jomoos, dey cost big money -now , dat's de fifteen or twenty dollah one. Now, yo' take dem jomoos dat cost big money, he nevah did wrap dem. He nevah would put dem in no bag - he always put it in a little bottle, an' he put lodestone in it . He had one special root dat he put in dere , an' dat wus Eve-an '-Adam. He 'd put Eve-an.

De fellah pick him up on de way comin' [to grandfather] , yo' know. An ' so he jes' dumped him out an' he jumped up on mah grandfather 's lap . An' he petted him an ' rubbed him on de back an' fiah jes ' spark from his back. So he looked up at de clock -it wus 'round ten-thirty den, an ' he says , \"Well,\" says , \"yo' say yo ' got plenty nerve .\" Say , \"Ah'm goin' try yo' out.\" Say , \"Ah ain 't goin' wit chew ­ah'm goin ' send yo '.\" Said, \"But ah 'll know how eve ' thing come out.\" So he give him de ole pot an ' he filled it up wit water. An' he give him some matches an' he went out tuh de woodpile an ' taken a ole axe an ' chipped him up some fat lightwood. [Lightwood, sometimes called !atwood, fat-lighter, lighter pine , etc., is several kinds of pines used for lighting fires - often the Georgia pine . All terms from Southern U.S.A. ] So he went on down tuh de fo 'ks of de road . Well, now de watah got tuh be boilin ' by twelve, an' de cat has gotta be put in dere at twelve, an' he gotta cook until he jes' - jes' put him in dere 'live . An' dis cat gotta be cooked until he come tuh be well done where yo' kin j es ' take de meat an ' jes' pull it off de bones . Dat's whut he tole dis fellah tuh do. Den he tole him some words tuh say tuh cuss God -yo' know , all dem things. An' dis fellah said dat it wus al l dat he could do tub stay dere. Suddenly, he said, while he wus doin' de cookin' of dat cat , he said dat he know dat cat had been cookin' at leas ' a hour, an ' he said, it look like he could hear dat cat whinin ' right on . He said it thundered an' lightnin'ed, an' hogs an ' cows, goats an' eve ' thin.' jes ' runnin 1 all round dere an ' barkin' an ' tryin ' tuh run him away from dere - an ' it jes ' athundered an' lightnin 'ed an ' flashin' jes' lak dat .

Ah sot an ' looked at dat. An' so mah grandfather he 'd taken all de bones out an ' he so»ted it an' he got de right bone . An' after he got de right bone, why dis fellah stood de test right in de room. After he got dat right bone mah grand­father dressed it fo' him . It wus a bone ah guess 'bout dat long -it wus small in de middle an' it 's large on each end , an ' jes' as white an' purty as it kin be.

She took dat heart, she driv it fulla needles - all through dat, needles. Now , ah - she buried it. But where she buried it, ah don't know.

(Can you tell me something else about how it started? How hoodooism started?) HoodOoism started way back in de time dat Moses days, back in ole ancient times, nine thousand years ago . Now you see, Moses, he was a prophet j is ' like Peter, Paul an' James. An' den he quit bein ' a prophet an ' started de hoodoo­ism-what we call de Seven Book o[Moses.

Now, if you got a mind to take it from me an ' de othah fellahs had a mind to take it from you -but you jis' rathah stay at home. You see , you have to go dere wit one mind - one intention . An' if you take your own an ' I take mine - not one fellah to beat de othah fellah out of anythin' because you won 't do any good. You see. But dat is done at de ahur of twelve a'clock. An' den you dig dere. Sometimes you hit it an ' don't git it. I see one night we hit a chest up here in Missippi [Mississ­ippi] at a place dey call in Missippi-five miles above Picayne , Miss. , on de Southern [Railroad] dey got a place dey call de Di'mon ' [Diamond] Hill. (Diamond Hill?) Yeah . Di'mon' Hill, Miss. Dat's six miles from Picayne, Miss. Well, dey started diggin' an' aftah d ey started to diggin' , de closer you git de more trou­ble you gon'a have. Now , dey got one spirit - he's wuser 'an any othah spirit. Dey got a gang of little spirits. You r ead de Bible dere some of 'em in it. Dey got a spirit wit his haid cut off. Now, it's all spirit haven't got de haid off. Dey some spirit walks jis ' like you -jis' look zackly like a man. An' den dey got one spirit wit his haid off.

'Hind - just like it's a hidden place. (Oh , some kind of a mirror or some kind of bureau or some thing?) Yes , yes -anywheres I hid so nobody can't see it. (Then wh at do you do?)

(And you g o there no particular number of mornings -just?) No, just somet ime when you feel like making a novena to him. But I just go for three mornings straight -you know, it' s odd, and he's a saint do all things. Well, I go to him three mornings straight and maybe I talk to him - I don't pray to him, just talk. And he do's things for yuh. (Wh at did you say about St. Peter?) Well St. Peter, he's a saint all righ t -but St. Peter is mostly for business. He got a key in his hand - he kin shut and he kin open. But chew [have to use] a plen ty green and a plenty thyme wit St. Peter. You know what thyme is don't you? (Thyme -herb , it smells?) No, it's -it's a pure plant grows here they call thyme. You can get it out the markets, anything. (Plenty green what?) Yes, uh -green, like parsley. Now you take St. Peter, he got the keys. If you got your place of business, you take yo u some thyme, you take some p arsley, and if there's any way to even get you some mis tletoe -you know what mist leto e is? If it's any way you can get you some mistletoe, you take that and put that together and fix it up, and take and get up early in the morning before the sun rise and you wash. You star t -just like you got your place of business in front -well y ou start right from your front door, from your front door with your water and sprinkle it. Keep your light burning to St. Peter, go on in backwards, make your wish, promise him what you wanta promise him. Keep your water right straight back, and when you scrub all your corners out , you get th at incense, that g reen incense and you burn it, and that d raws your business. He's really for business. He can close now, just as good as he can open -he can close. Now, i f you f ail to do as you promise to him , he going to shut you up and you be in so much trouble till you have to shut up. (What color candle do you burn to St. Peter?) White and red. (White and red.) A dark red. (Either one?) Either one -white or red. Now for luck, to St. Peter you burn your reds. The most of the people have their candles burning a distance from him, you know. (Why is that?) That's to draw -that's to draw . Those candles draws you see and you gotta honor him, but not so close. You honor St. Peter , but you don't honor him close as you would St. Raymond, and you keeps your candles away from him and that's to draw. [Informant has the wrong reason . Candles are kept at a distance from St. Peter because he is a pyromaniac (see 3034-3040 , p.874f.).] (Did you ever hear of them using holy water?) Well, the holy water is something to keep -to keep all evil just from around. You get you a bottle of this holy water f or instance, if you're worried and dis-• satisfied and your mind's upsetted. I pass by every morning and washes my hand in holy water.

Now , that 's in that cross- that cross you done made with their name. Well, then, that black candle is still burning. When that candle get low , it's going to make a big oil around, you know, like that candle melt - going to kiver that name plumb up , but it still going to be burning on that name. Well, you take that candle and you put a new candle in there, and you keep it burning just as many days as you want -nine or ten days , long as you wanta. And long as you keep that candle burning you can keep 'em lingePing and dragging, but the moment you want 'em to go, just let that candle burn completely out and they goes out with the candle.

And peace abides with you 'cause you burn in front of Jesus and He know you wants peace. (I see.) You wears your clothes , as I first to ld you, on the wrong side - wear your shoes on the wrong feet. And then when that candle is strictly burning on you and you know it's burning on you, you - every night you awoke when that candle is lit - now , for instance , they have three candles started. They'll burn that candle on you round twelve o'clock in the day , round five o'clock in the morning .

And you put it there and give to him to drink , and the first drink he gets he will never drink another drink as long as he live. That's if you wanta break him up . A person steals something from you and you wants them to bring it back. You could go to St . Raymond and make a nine day novena.

You go to him and make the nine day novena and promise him what you going to give him for that , and in the ninth day those th ings supposed to be returned back to you -if there 's any way for it to get back, it supposed to be turned back to you. Now, I had a watch taken from me - was brought and laid on my bed by St. Raymond. Nine tacks . You can take nine nails and you kin take them nails and taCks and you can put 'em in people 's drink to make 'em drink off it, and that kills them spells people put on them .

And you can take it - and take it and burn it and make a dust and it's the best remedy in the world for piles . You know what piles are . Some people don 't believe in piles - they afraid to hurt. But if you take chicken feathers and burn it and mix it with fresh lard and put just a little alum in it, that draws your piles. But this here smoking for asme - that cures asme, smoked feathe rs . Dirt dauber's nest is confusion , too. (How do they handle that?) You take a dirt dauber nest and you go and pull it down, and you break that dirt dauber's nest up and you mix it with graveyard dirt. And you take whosom­ever you want to get in trouble , you get you some war water. You put that dirt dauber' s nest in the bo ttle [of war water] and that graveyard dirt and you shake it up, and you cuss that dirt for everything you can think of and you bust it [bottle] down at a person 's place.

See , chicken feet -those curly chicken feets - they kills any kind of thing that they put down. For instance, you could take one of those chickens what's curly [a frizzly chicken , pp. S9-61] and put him out there in that baCk yard, and if anybody put anything out there for you, he going to scratch [it up ] and the next morning he'll have a form [of the scratch­up ob ject] on his leg that big - the stuff they put down there for you.

Just like they put something down for you to ketch in your jints , that chicken going to scratch -see, he scratches all day and all night practically , that big curly chicken. And in the morning you ' ll see something wh at you would've caught that chicken ke tched. They keeps that [chicken] for to get up things like that - that chicken scratches anything . Apples , orang es, bananas , grapes is the fruit -you keep that always on the table . That was used on the table when Christ was betrayed so that bound to be lucky, you see. You keep that there because there's thirteen of them there at the table . But on that table you didn't see nothing but a big dish of fruit and those candles and a little wine. Well, wine is a lucky drink, but those fruits, if you keep those fruit in your house, you will be always happy , lucky and suc­cessful .

She tie nine knots in it and she curse every knot she tie , and she put some lodestone on it and she 'll wear it around her waist. (Wait a minute. Does she wear the big piece or just a little piece?) It's a little piece - a string. (Oh, just a little piece she tore off . All right.) The string . Well, she will wear that around her waist or even pin it in here or anywheres close to her body . And the other piece that's left, every time she go with him she'll take that and she 'll put it in the bed where she sleep, and she sleep on top of that.

The pack­age containing it would be ao bigger than that. At twelve o'clock in the day when you - well, just you be on some neutral ground where it's earth just before twelve. Just as the clock strikes twelve , you make your wish, say, \"Oh, I wish my man would come back to me, I'm going to try to get him if I can.\" And at that time when the whistles start to blowing - during the whole time it's ringing , you be burying that down in the earth and kiver it up . And in less time - in three days he'll be walking in your door. (If you want this man to leave you?) If you want him to leave you and you don't want nothing to do with him at all, you take you some roed foot powdero.

You could bring a beautiful bouquet of flowers -probably have some bad ones or dead ones in there. Well, if something bad on your mind when you get a bouquet of flowers , there is something dead in it. Now , long as you get a beautiful set of flowers and all of them is all beautiful and pretty, well, it's no harm there - it 's nothing but loveness , kindness , and happiness. But you get a bouquet of flowers - you go buy a bouquet of flowers and you look all over those flowers - some of them is dead and some of them is wilted. Well, your mind runs just like those flowers do . You got all kinds of bad i deas and mean things.

After a long search he was ab le to locate one for which he had to pay $37.50 -the original having cost $7.50. Within 20 years, perhaps less , an edition of 2000 books had become a collector's item. We will soon learn that Western Illinois University failed to obtain a volume . Did Arthur Godfrey cause the disappearance? Years ago he read sections of FA CI over the radio, giving the name and address of the New York City printer. A number of persons all ov er the country discovered me . I saw one of their letters some months ago. What has happened to the second edition of FA CI -much enlarged in subject matter - I have already described (see p.XLI) . Because Dr. D uncan Emrich and I have been discussing a possible abridged edition in paper back, I thought it might be convenient to list a few comments made by Librarians. Remember, most universities accept by formally printed card or shee�: Oxford, Cambridge, London , Edinburgh , Paris (the Sorbonne) , Munich , Vienna, Basel, Rome , Madrid, Mexico, Capetown, Sydney, Tokyo , Princeton , Yale, Columbia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan , Texas , etc. What follows will be quoted from typewritten letters and notes : \"Harvard College Library gratefully acknowledges receipt of your gift to the Library of FoZkZore from Adams County IZZinois.
