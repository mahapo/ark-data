It was an experience ofhorror and pain, combined with a certain ghostly terror, yet at the sametime it was the key to the purest and holiest spiritual ecstasy that exists.(Crowley, Confessions 109)WkiTiNG AN ARTICLE about the relationship between AugustStrindberg and the British writer and occultist AleisterCrowley (1875-1947) may at times resemble an account ofparallel lives. If taken out of context, the excerpt above could fit intoStrindberg's Inferno just as well as into the book to which it belongs,the autobiography The Confessions of Aleister Crowley. Crowley^s magicalexperience, which took place in Stockholm on 31 December 1896, wasthe first in his life and became a turning point in his esoteric develop-ment. Meanwhile in Lund—not far removed and at about the sametime—Strindberg was beginning his studies of Swedenborg, whoprofoundly influenced his mystical ideas (Brandell, Paris 231-2). Moregenerally, it appears that Crowley, even though he was twenty-six yearsyounger than Strindberg and had never met him, went through similarpersonal, spiritual, and artistic experiences in the decades between thetwo centuries. Both were born into religious, middle-class families;both experienced wealth and economic trouble; both ttirned to intenseand heterogeneous writing afrer troubled university studies; and bothexperienced bohemian hfe in Paris and enjoyed contacts with the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"324 SCANDINAVIAN STUDIESartistic avant-garde. Both went through personal crises and eventuallyfound a guardian angel, as they each formulated it: Strindberg turnedto Swedenborg {Inferno 202) and Crowley to the preternatural entityAiwass, from which he claimed to have received the Liber Al Vel Legisor Book of the Law in 1904, the text that became the foundation of hisesoteric thought, Thelema (Pasi, \"Varieties\" 156-60).The aim of this article is to investigate Crowle/s acquaintance withSttindberg's work and to explore its esoteric, scientific, and literaryimplications. I will concenttate on die review of Inferno (and, to a lesserdegree, on that of Sow of a Servant), which Crowley published in hisjournal TheEquinox in 1913. These reviews provide important material forunderstanding the literary and/or esoteric productions of both authors.They offer evidence of the reception of Sttindberg's works in occultcircles after die Inferno period.' Such a reception based on his occultassociation invites a reconsideration of his inttoduction in Britain as awhole. Accordingly, a significant number of the early Sttindberg ttansla-tions were either done or published by esotericists, a fact that sttonglyaffected the horizon of expectations of his readers, Crowley included.Most importantiy, Crowle/s review questions Inferno's reliability as anautobiography—an unusual developement in Sttindberg's early recep-tion in Britain—and invites rather a reading informed by Crowle/s\"scientific illuminism\" and anti-Victorianism, two currents which weredeeply rooted in the avant-garde and radical discourses of the age.2. STRINDBERG'S EARLY BRITISH RECEPTIONBy 1913, when Crowley reviewed Sttindberg, Sttindberg's reputation inBritain was based mainly on an isolated ttanslation of The Father and ahandful of obscure productions of his plays (The Stronger in 1906 and1909, The Eather in 1911, Miss Julie and Creditors in 1912). A few articleshad followed J. T. Grein's unsuccessful attempt to stage The Eather in1893, which presented Sttindberg primarily as a pessimist and misogynist(Rem, \"Premature\" 151). Twenty years later, this was still the predominantI. Although the study of Strindberg's reading of esoteric texts and their influence ofthese on his work has a long and flourishing tradition (see Lamm; Brandell, StrindbergsInfemokris; Stockenström; Gavel-Adams, The GenericAmbiguity; and Szalczer, only to citethe major ones), the way esotericists looked at his texts is still an underexplored matter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OE STRINDBERG 325view when as many as twelve Strindberg transladons were issued between1912 and 1913, possibly capitalizing on the attention surrounding theauthor's death in 1912. However, the numerous transladons must not beequated with success, since Strindberg's reception continued to sufferfrom hostility and accusations of misogyny (Ewbank 7-25; Robinson10-9). Arguably, Strindberg's legacy suffered from a lack of committedcritics and translators such as William Archer and George Bernard Shaw,who had managed to introduce his colleague Henrik Ibsen on the Bridshstage. A difficult acting style, discontinuity of genre, and generally poortransladons might also have discouraged potendally interested actorswho would easily turn to Archer's carefully wrought translations andto the structural consistent' of Ibsen's bourgeois drama. Ibsen's suc-cess in Britain was pardy an obstacle for Strindberg, who was receivedas \"simply another Scandinavian writer, someone not quite of Ibsen'sstature\" (Rem, \"Premature\" 150-4; Robinson 11-2).The wave of Strindberg translations in 1912 and 1913 occasionedtwo peculiar developments. Since about half of the works publishedwere autobiographical, Strindbetg was seen primarily in that context,a fact that encouraged the identification of him with his characters(Rem, \"Premature\" 152,156).^ About one third of these translationswere either issued by a publisher of esoteric literature (Rider) orwere done by a translator who specialized in esoteric matters (ClaudField), a situation that spread the idea of Strindberg as an \"esoteric\"author. Both aspects influenced the horizon of expectations of Britishreaders and are of crucial importance for understanding Crowle/sreading of Strindberg.3. ALEISTER CROWLEY'S REVIEW OE INFERNOAleister Crowley is arguably one of the most influendal figures inmodem occultism. His magical pracdces and esoteric writings, which hecultivated alongside a rich literary producdon, \"have heavily influencedcontemporary new religious movements of a magical and neo-paganbent\" (Pasi, \"Aleister Crowley\" 281).

A prolific author of poetry,drama, novels, short stories, articles, and essays, as well as a painter,Crowley had the capacity to assimilate and inttoduce himself in severalkey literary and artistic currents of his age, and his literary productionand position in the European avant-garde are still awaiting properrecognition. He started his literary career with poetry in the vein ofBritish romanticism and decadence while a student at Trinity College,Cambridge (1895-1898) and had the occasion to measure his produc-tion against that of Wilüam Buder Yeats, whom he met in London in1899 as a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. A fewyears later, in 1902-1903, Crowley was part of the literary circle of theParis restaurant Le Chat Blanc, where he met, among others, WilliamSomerset Maugham (Kaczynskiii2-5). Ini9i2-i9i3—the period duringwhich he wrote his reviews of Sttindberg—Crowley was active at theLondon cabaret The Cave of the Golden Calf, which had been foimdedby Strindberg's ex-wife Frida Uhl and was a catalyst for the Englishand international avant-garde movement (Buchmayr 269-92). He wasa well-connected person in the European avant-garde and very up-to-date with regard to European cultural Ufe.Crowley's reviews of Inferno and Son of a Servant were publishedin the tenth issue of his journal The Equinox in September 1913(Kaczynski 265). Whether Crowley had read Strindberg before 1913is urdoiown. In the Confessions (104) he mentions Strindberg whenspeaking of his holidays in Scandinavia in the 1890s, but this referenceis of litde consequence since the book first came out in 1929- In anycase, Strindberg was surely known in the circle of The Equinox since acontemporary poem by Crowley's disciple Victor Neuburg mentionsStrindberg's plays (Neuburg 251), and Frida Uhl sat on the editorialboard of the journal (Crowley, \"Waite's Wet\" 233-4).' What undoubt-edly played a role in Crowley's choice to review Strindberg was thepublishing house that issued his translations. William Rider & Son3. The relationship between Crowley and Uhl has not been previously researched. In anote from early 1912, Harry Graf Kessler mentions Crowley as Uhl's \"mystisch sexuellenFreund\" (786) [mysterious sexual friend]. Uhl's biographer Friedrich Buchmayr (289)mentions a manuscript, probably of a play, that Crowley had submitted for performanceat the Golden Calf, and Crowley himself recalls Uhl as a \"Danish siren\" in his 1922 novelDiary of a Drug Fiend (20)."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OF STRINDBERG 327had been foimded in 1908, when it took over from occult publisherPhilip Welby (\"About Rider Books\"). Under the direction of RalphShirley, Rider developed an impressive catalogue of esoteric booksand also published a monthly journal. The Occult Review, with whichCrowley often collaborated. Crowley was well acquainted with theRider catalogue, as is evident from the frequent reviews of its booksin The Equinox.The paratexts of Rider's edition oflnfemo offer a significant frameworkfor understanding Crowle/s reading of Sttindberg. In the catalogue atthe back of the book, the novel is not listed imder the heading \"fiction,\"but rather \"philosophy.\" Infemo is presented as \"an autobiographicalwork by the celebrated Swedish author, similar in character to OscarWilde's De Frofundis\" (6). The peculiar profile of the publisher and itsplacement in the catalogue clearly show that the novel was imderstoodand sold as an esoteric work. On the other hand, its presentationconfirms the reception of Strindberg as an author of autobiographies.In his inttoduction, ttanslator Claud Field also insists on the autobio-graphical and esoteric aspects of the novel. The two peculiar elementsof Sttindberg's British reception are therefore clearly evident and biasthe horizon of expectadons of the reader.At a first sight, Crowley's judgment of the novel seems utterly nega-tive. The review opens with a polemical remark: \"I have already had tospeak to publishers about cheap production. In this case I must pro-test emphatically against the employment of a ttanslator who makes asolecism nearly every time he touches Paris\" (Crowley, \"Inferno\" 227).Crowley is reacting against the imprecise \"domestication,\" to borrowa term from ttanslation studies, of Parisian place names, which he alsolists in the review.* Here he seems to lack a precise reproduction ofthatfragmentary landscape that makes Infemo a \"modernist tale of confu-sion\" (Stenport 95), where Parisis ... not constructed as a bustling metropolis of industrial and culturalproducdon, nor as a spectacle of consumption already mythologized4. Crowley does not seem to have read the book carefully, as many of these malapropismsare actually not present in the English transladon or derive from Strindberg's French text,which was the source of the transladon. The proof that Field translated from Frenchand not Swedish lies in an error—which Crowley righdy points out—in the spelling ofa French street. While the French text (and Field's) mendons \"rue de Madame\" (138/82),the Swedish text correcdy reads \"rue Madame\" (139)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"328 SCANDINAVIAN STUDIESby the end of the nineteenth-centur)', but as an intriguing formalamalgamation that combines late nineteenth-century transnational anddisplaced mythologies about urban modernity, occultism, and literaryaesthetics with subversive defiance. (98)In Inferno the experience of the city goes hand in hand with the eso-teric experience; Crowley, who had lived long in Paris and had led asimilar bohemian life to Strindberg, is pointing out and advocatingone of the elements that makes Inferno one of Strindberg's most avant-garde narratives. The tie between the urban and the esoteric is in facttoned down in the English translation, both with the domesticationof place names and extensive cuts and summaries, which—curiouslyfor a publisher like Rider—leave out entire passages focusing on thedevil, Swedenborg, astral bodies, gold synthesis, and Satanism.^ Tosome extent, therefore, domestication seems to turn into bowdleriza-tion. Then Crowley goes on to attack the author:The constant chemical absurdities are perhaps Strindberg'sown and may have been made intentionally, as the book por-trays the ravings of a melancholic with delusions of persecution.What sublime and septuple ass calls this Strindberg's autobiography?Strindberg was too lazy to find his incidents in other people's lives;that is all. (Crowley, \"Inferno\" 228).Here Crowley goes into the issues of alchemy and autobiography,which I will discuss in the next sections. Finally, he sums up the plotof what he calls \"a perfect clinical picture of a typical case\" (\"Inferno\"228) by joining and pardy anticipating a critical approach that flour-ished between the 1920s and the 1950s (Gavel Adams, \"Kommentarer\"330-2). He concludes with the esoteric interests of the main character:\"For refuge he ranges from Papus to Swedenborg, and ultimately, as hismental disease increases on him, he clutches at such straws as Péladan,Annie Besant, and the Church of Rome. In this dementia the bookends\" (\"Inferno\" 228).The dismissal of the book seems total, but one must read betweenthe lines and interpret Crowley's criticism in the light of his religious,esoteric, and cultural thought at that period. In order to do so, wehave to start with an inquiry into the relationship between Strindbergand esotericism.5.

STRINDBERG, ESOTERICISM, OCCULTISM, AND THEFRENCH AVANT-GARDEThe term \"esotericism\" has a long and complex history, and there is stillno complete scholarly agreement on its defiiiition (Pasi, \"II problema\").According to Antoine Faivre's definition, esotericism is a \"form ofthought\" that originated in the Western world during the Renaissanceand is concerned with a body of ancient works essentially focused onthree \"ttaditional sciences,\" i.e. alchemy, asttology, and magic. Esoteri-cism differs from mysticism as the former is interested in the mediations(such as rituals, symbolic images, and intermediary entities) that creativeimagination reveals to the inner eye of the esotericist in order to reachGod or a supernatural entity. The latter, on the conttary, is concernedwith eliminating these mediations perceived as obstacles to union withthe divine (Faivre 4-8). Furthermore, esotericism differs from occultisminsofar as the second is a modern variant of the first \"referring to thespecifically French currents in the wake of Eüphas Lévi, flourishing inthe 'neo-martinist' context of Papus and related manifestations of fin-de-siède esotericism\" (Hanegraiff 888).Based on these terms and oppositions, one could infer that Sttindbergdeveloped an interest in occultism that lasted from his first contactswith theosophy in 1884 until the end of the Inferno period and histurn to mysticism in conjunction with his studies of Swedenborg andthe writing of Till Damaskus. It would be misleading to consider hima practicing occultist if his relatively short period of active alchemicalexperiments in Paris in 1894-1896 is excluded. This view is corroboratedby a series of other considerations. Strindberg showed littie inclina-tion toward the most ritualistic (and Crowle/s favorite) of the threettaditional esoteric disciplines (i.e. magic). His interest in the works ofEliphas Lévi focused on La clef desgrands mystères (1861) and on Levi'sdiscussion of the astral body and astral plan (Carlson 199-202), butnot on his far more practical Dogme et rituel de haute magie (1854-1856).FtuiJiermore, although Strindberg claimed (through the protagonistof Inferno) to have studied black magic {Inferno 103) and briefly usedthe adjective \"occultist\" to describe hknsdíQJaturvetenskapliga 456-7),there is good reason to believe that he never took a decisive step intomagical practice.

Encausse was also the leader of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"33O SCANDINAVIAN STUDIESL'Ordre Martiniste, but Strindberg was never initiated into this orderand was harshly cridcized for having, more or less openly, claimed tobe a member (Gavel-Adams, \"Guldmakaren\" 140).*Strindberg's interest in occultism and its expression minfemo must,therefore, be put into its proper perspecdve. It was a personal andspiritual research that yielded him fruitful literary results, but he wasnot a fully committed occuldst. It was also, to some extent, Strind-berg's attempt to position himself in the French avant-garde. The riseof French occuldsm deeply inspired local ardsts and men of letters andtowards the end of the 1800s it permeated a large sector of the Frenchavant-garde, the symbolists inprimis. The figure of the artist was oftencompared to that of the alchemist (Moffitt 13-63), and Strindberg'sself-presentation as an alchemist in Infemo and other works, whichculminated in his portrait as alchemist on the back cover of the Swed-ish edition of Antibarbarus, is entirely consistent with this view. ForStrindbetg, becoming \"Ockuldsmens Zola\" {Brep 307) [The Zola ofoccultism] meant being part of the avant-garde, but it was also a shortand instrumental infatuation. In one important sense, in fact, Infemowas a marketing move, a \"position-taking\" (Bourdieu 214, 231-4)in the French literary field, an attempt to become part of the trendof novels with occult motives that had been growing in the country(Gavel-Adams, \"Strindberg\" 125-6). This was crucial for Strindberg inthe 1890S when he was trying to present himself as a French, Europeanwriter as opposed to a \"provincial\" Swede.Inferno's des to French occultism were surely evident to Crowley asmany of the occuldsts he picks up (and dismisses) from the book wereleading representatives of that movement. At the same time, Strind-berg's scant knowledge of pracdcal occultism glares through the pagesof the book. The protagonist says that he has studied the methods ofblack magic but does not mention a single ritual he performs. On oneoccasion, he is even worried about having unwillingly and clumsilycast a spell on his wife's grandmother {Inferno 216). He often also refersto his contact with the French occviltists but rarely elaborates on hisinvolvement with them. Although Crowley's reading of Infemo is farfrom autobiographical, the fact that Strindbetg mainly remained on6. According to Infemo (198), it was Strindberg who kept them at a distance with hisresistance to any subordination to their societies, but this statement is clearly contradictedby the reprimand of the Martinists."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OF STRINDBERG 331the boundaries of a mild occultism and mysticism affects the book'sesoteric capital and explains in part Crowley's delusion. Crowley,who had been a practicing occultist almost since he first cultivated anesoteric interest, had litde sympathy for amateurs. But was this theonly reason for his dismissal of the occult choices of the protagonist?5. STRINDBERG, CROWLEY, AND EUROPEAN OCCULTISMAs was just mentioned, Crowle)''s review of Inferno includes a list ofoccultists mentioned in the book, whom he dismisses one by one callingthem \"straws\" at which the protagonist \"clutches\" when \"his mentaldisease increases on him\" (228). The first \"straw,\" Gérard Encausse(Papus), was a physician and occultist who had co-founded, togetherwith another \"sttaw,\" the writer Joséphin Péladan, the Ordre kabbal-istique de la Rose-Croix in 1888. Although at times Crowley seemed tohave tteated Encausse with respect, he later dismissed his and Péladan'sRosicrucian order as \"lack[ing] full knowledge and authority\" {Magickch. 12, pt. 2). As for Annie Besant, the third \"straw\" and president of theTheosophical Society, Crowley simply considered her 1907 appointmentas an \"unscrupulous usurpation\" {Confessions 847). In Jime 1913, shordybefore writing xhe Inferno review, Crowley had harshly attacked Besantbecause she attempted to influence the election of the Grand Masterof the Masonic Rite of Memphis and Mizraim and move it into thesphere of influence of the Theosophical Society {Confessions 760; \"InMemoriam\"; Kaczynski 262-3). Crowley's excoriation of these occult-ists from the book is evidendy the basis of a personal polemic. This isparticularly evident in the case of Péladan and Besant since Sttindbergonly briefly touches upon them at the end of Inferno (301). These twofigures also had the disadvantage of being interested in Christian eso-tericism, a highly disfavorable characteristic in Crowley's eyes.Sttindberg was ttapped in a row between British and French occultistsas is evident in the publication history of Inferno. Rider was the officialpublisher of the esoteric scholar Arthur Edward Waite, who had beenthe first to recommend esoteric readings to Crowley as early as 1898(Kaczynski 40-1). In spite of this early acquaintance, Waite came to bethe object of frequent violent criticisms from Crowley, who did nothold his scholarship in great esteem. The main reasons were his Chris-tian faith and his former membership of the Golden Dawn, which"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"332 SCANDINAVIAN STUDIESCrowley considered to be fuU of \"poseurs and pretenders to magicalattainment\" (Asprem 146, italics original). 1912 and 1913 saw the peakof a campaign Crowley waged against Waite, which included slander,a false obituary, and a slaughtering review of his translation of Lévi'sLa clef des grands mystères. Both articles were published in the sameissue of The Equinox barely pages apart from the Strindberg reviews.In other words, it would have been difficult for a book published byRider to win Crowley's favor at this juncture, and the Inferno reviewfitted perfecdy into this integrated system of public slander. Moregenerally, Crowley's attitude can be explained by his attempt, espe-cially strong in 1913, to estabhsh his position in the field of Britishoccultism. Through The Equinox, he wanted to mark his distance andalleged superiority with respect to other occultists and especially theformer members of the Golden Dawn (such as Waite and Encausse).Strindberg and Inferno found themselves squeezed in this struggle.If the book showed that Strindberg was just posturing in magicalpractice, his position in Crowley's eyes worsened as a result of hischaracter's search of occult knowledge from precisely the occultistsCrowley disdained and from whom he wanted to distance himselfAnother important point in Crowley's criticism concerns Sweden-borg and the Roman Church. It is well known that the reading ofSwedenborg, whom Strindberg discovered during his stay at the Uhl'shome in Austria and took up again upon his setdement in Lund, wasone of the crucial steps of his \"rebirth\" after thelnfemo crisis. The lastpages of Inferno (302-11) also show the main character's interest inCatholicism (filtered through Besant and Péladan), to which Strind-berg also returned in the following years although he never converted.This turn to Christian mysticism must have deeply baffled Crowley,who since his years at the university had progressively abandoned theChristian education he had received from the Plymouth Brethren. Asfor Swedenborg, the fact that Crowley almost never mentions himin his works is indicative of his judgment. The only mention I havebeen able to trace is in the poem The Sword of Song (1904), where hecalls Swedenborg an \"idea-monger of Christianit)',\" and, addressinghim and other mystics, he laconically states: \"I wish to immask thesepeople : I perfecdy agree with nearly everything they say, but their claimto be Christians is utterly conftising, and lends a lustre to Christianitywhich is quite foreign\" (III)."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OE STRINDBERG 333In reading the Inferno review in the light of The Sword ofSonß, itis tempting to draw a parallel between Crowley's judgment of theprotagonist of the novel and the Swedish mystic. They both tried tobe esotericists, and they both failed: the reason was their choice of theChristian religion. Christianity is the issue for which Crowley is mostcritical of Strindberg zná Inferno. It is on this matter that he expresseshis most radical views. This is also the point at which Strindberg andCrowley part ways as esotericists: while the former, already an amateuroccultist, chose the way of Christian mysticism, the latter started a processof radicalization of his anti-Christian thought. In addition, one shouldnot underestimate the threat that the Christian undertone of the endof Inferno could represent for Crowley in the British occult milieux.As Rider was presenting the book as an esoteric novelty, the process ofthe Christian redemption of the protagonist was a direct challenge toCrowley's own anti-Christian agenda and his plans for hegemony inthe British occult milieux. Such a threat had to be crushed.6. CROWLEY, STRINDBERG, AND AUTOBIOGRAPHYCrowley's final word on Strindberg seems to be one of dismissal, buta closer look at the review suggests it is more complex, especially ifone bears in mind that Crowley's statements shotild never be takenat face value. He had—not unlike Strindberg—a highly contradictorypersonality with a strong tendency to \"transformism\" and to assumepositions apparendy impossible to reconcile with one another (Pasi,Aleister Crowley 49-50). If this tendency makes his writing and state-ments highly imreliable, it also opens the door to a range of differentinterpretations. In the following sections, I will address this problemby focusing on three main aspects of Crowley's review of Inferno, i.e.its autobiographical, scientific, and radical implications.The review of Inferno openly questions one of two main assumptionsof the British reception of^ Strindberg, i.e. the autobiographical nattireof his works. Crowley seems very skeptical about this point and asks inthe review \"what sublime and septuple ass calls this Strindberg's autobi-ography? Strindberg was too lazy to find his incidents in other people'slives ; that is all.\" As he continues, the \"chemical absurdities... may havebeen made intentionally,\" and the protagonist's visionary experimentscontribute to the moulding of the character, who is \"a melancholic"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"334 SCANDINAVIAN STUDIESwith delusions of persecution\" (\"Inferno\" 228). Following Crowle/sreasoning, one could argue that the character's frequent contradic-tions, var}'ing moods, and questionable alchemical experiments (beit the product of Sttindberg's conscious choice or not) are natural forthe kind of weak and ignorant character the protagonist seems to be.Rather interestingly, Crowle/s rejection of the autobiographical aspectof the novel seems to anticipate Olof Lagercrantz's reading of Infernoas a work of fiction, as tiie porttait of an \"inner Strindberg\" and not asa proper autobiography (336-9). According to Lagercrantz, Inferno isa sort of mise en scène of Strindberg's self that is masked by the illusionthat the protagonist is the same person who wrote the scientific essayspubUshed in Sttindberg's name. The protagonist, whom Lagercrantzcalls \"en arm stackare, vidskeplig, lättskrämd\" (337) [a poor weakling,superstitious, easily scared] is the same person suffering from \"mentaldisease\" whom Crowley criticizes. Furthermore, Lagercrantz points outthat, imlike the protagonist, the narrator \"har ett bröst sa högt välvtatt han formar springa kapp med hästar och är modig och ofÖrvägen\"(337) [is puffing his chest out so much that he could challenge a horseto a race, he is brave and daring]. Crowley makes a similar point aboutthe end of the book: \"In this dementia the book ends. But Strindbergdid not end. He went his cheerñil and polygamous way as a free-thinker\" (\"Inferno\" 228). Crowley, who knew well the psychologicalpressure and the possibly dangerous consequences of occult practice,does not find continuity between the protagonist's inner journey andStrindberg's post-Inferno life, and this fact causes the autobiographicalaspect of the novel to collapse.The same rejection of the work as autobiography is found inCrowle/s review of Son of a Servant, which is a more conspicuouslyautobiographical book and was presented as such in the inttoductionto the Rider edition. In his review, which is Htde more than a satiricalrewriting in dramatic form of two episodes from the book, Crowleycriticizes Johan but does not make a single reference to the fact that hemight be Sttindberg. Instead, he ridicules him in ways similar to hisapproach to the protagonist of Inferno. He has \"a soul of a servant\" andsuffers from victimization : \"He is always being 'bullied' and tteated witii'injustice,' however kind people are to him\" (Crowley, \"Son\" 231). Thechoice of reviewing Son of a Servant in dramatic form serves to mockthe protagonist, which in turn fimctions as a reprimand of his discipleVictor Neuburg. The dramatic form also fosters the idea of a mise en"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OF STRINDBERG 335scène of Strindberg's self through literature. As he does with Infemo,Crowley looks at Son of a Servant as a disguised fictional work.This fictional aspect is also one of the reasons why Crowley, in theend, reappraises both books. The appreciation of Inferno's narrative—especially of its rhythm—is evident in his summary of the plot in thereview, and, as far as Son of a Servant is concerned, the review closeswith a positive tone: \"As the book consists of litde else but episodes ofthis kind [i.e. of self-victimizadon], it will be seen that the entertainedattendon of the judicious reader need never flag\" (Crowley, \"Son\" 232).At least, it seems, the book is entertaining.7. INFERNO AND \"SCIENTIEIC ILLUMINISM\"In the very last sentence of the Infemo review, Crowley states that\"until Strindberg's life is utterly dissociated from his art, the latter willnot be truly valued\" (228). He does not direcdy say of what this \"arf'needing to be \"valued\" consists but gives some hints by insisting onthe \"scientific\" qualities of Strindberg's narrative: Infemo, as he puts it,\"is a perfect clinical picture of a typical case\" (228). This opens the doorfor a reading of Infemo in the light of Crowley's occult thought of theperiod, i.e. his \"scientific illuminism.\"In late Victorian and Edwardian England, the rise of rationalism andscientific naturalism had not managed to establish a system of valuesstrong enough to replace Christianity, which was undergoing a deepcrisis caused by Darwinism and positivism. The result of this impasseleft many unsatisfied with both religion and science. Christianity hadbeen dismissed as irrational, but science alone did not manage to satisfythe spiritual exigencies of the individual (Pasi, \"L'andcristianesimo\" 52).It was in this spiritual gap that psychic research, spiritism, occultism,theosophy, and oriental philosophy gained ground in Europe. Crowleywas not immune to this wind of change. As a student in Cambridge,he came into contact with scientific naturalism and agnosticism,and in 1900 during a stay in Ceylon, he started studying Buddhism,which he considered for a period a valid and \"rational\" alternative toChristianity (49-52). Such a series of events had two consequences:firsdy, the exacerbation of his view of Christianity, and, secondly, theassimilation of the scientific method, to which he repeatedly returnedin his occult studies and practices, especially those relating to magic(Asprem and Pasi, \"Varieties\")."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"336 SCANDINAVIAN STUDIESThis course was not uncommon among occultists at the turn of thecentury, who were profoundly preoccupied with the scientific aspectof their docttines, a position not considered incompatible with theiresoteric beliefs, but rather a necessary component. As had happened toChristianity, occultism was running the risk of lapsing into the irrationaland being crushed by rationalism and scientific naturalism. Occultiststried, therefore, to gain a new legitimacy by insisting on their docttinesas rationally and scientifically acceptable (Pasi, Aleister Crowley 96).The protagonist of Inferno also seems to be concerned with thisparticular aspect of occultism of the^» de siècle. This excerpt from thefourth chapter is exemplary:Initié dans les sciences naturelles depuis mon enfance, plûtard adhérent deDarmn,j'avais découvert l'insuffisance de cette méthode scientifique qui recon-nût la mécanisation de l'univers sans admettre le mécanicien. La faiblessedu système se révéla par une dégénération générale de la science qui s'étaitposé une ligne de démarcation au-delà de laquelle on ne devait avancer...Or, cette année iSps la découverte de l'Argon confirma mes suppositionspréconçues, et donna un nouvel élan à mes recherches interrompues par unmariage étourdi. La science ne banquerouta pas, mais la science surannée,dénaturée fit faillite. (52)Dedicated from my childhood to the natural sciences, and later on adisciple of Darwin, I had discovered how unsatisfaaory the scientificmethod is, which accepts the mechanism of the universe without pre-supposing a Mechanician. The weakness of the system showed itself inthe gradual degeneration of science; it had marked off a boundary lineover which one was not to step.... Now in this year, 1895, the discov-ery of argon has confirmed my former hypotheses, and given a freshimpulse to my investigations which had been interrupted by a foolishmarriage. It is not Science which is bankrupt, only the antiquated,degenerate science. (28-9)The excerpt is typical of the approach that brings the protagonist ofInferno to discover alchemy: behind his occult interest lies a sdentijicway of thinking. The protagonist seeks to demonsttate scientifically thepresence of other elements in sulphur. This is a scientific as well as aspiritual process—a duality which is one of the pillars of alchemy. Thisaspect of Inferno can successñilly be read autobiographically. Strindbergalso sought a third way to resolve the struggle between science andreligion, by using a scientific method to approach occult studies Heexplained this in a 1896 letter to the Norwegian painter Frits Thaulow:\" [Jag] slutade ... med att bli ockultist; det vill saga: jag erhöll faktiska"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OF STRINDBERG 337bevis genom naturvetenskaperna, att själen var huf\\aidsaken, det mate-riela endast en tilfällig omklädnad, att vi voro odödliga, skapade, styrdaefter en viss plan\" (Sttindberg, Brev 285) [(I) decided ... to become anoccultist, which means that I, through the natural sciences, obtainedfactual evidence that the soul is the core, that the material world isbarely an occasional covering, that we are immortal, created, conttolledaccording to a given plan].''Occuldsm was for Sttindberg a scientific current focused on bothspiritual life and humanit)''s place in the cosmos {Inferno 342), a disci-pline that allowed him to avoid the pitfalls of the \"degenerate\" sciencethat does not \"presuppose a Mechanician\" {The Infemo 28) and thattried to explain scientifically the matters of the soul. This is the pointwhere Sttindberg's thought comes closest to Crowley's, who, whileediting The Equinox (1909-1913), was as well experiencing a particularlyfruitftol moment in his scientific study of occultism, which he called\"scientific illuminism.\" Quite programmatically. The Equinox's subtidewas \"The Review of Scientific Illuminism,\" and the cover of each issuecarried the motto \"The Method of Science—the Aim of Religion.\" AsCrowley—not without self-flattery-puts it in the Confessions,The Equinox was the first setious attempt to put before the public thefacts of occult science.... It was the first attempt in history to treat thesubject with scholarship and from the standpoint of science. No previ-ous book of its kind can compare with it for ... the rigidit)' of its rulenever to make any statement which could not be proved as preciselyas the mathematician exacts. (655-6)This excerpt clearly shows that Crowley and Sttindberg, in this respect,shared the same view on occultism. They surely differed in their intellec-tual grasp of the matter and in the outcome of their studies: the formerrejected Christianity and devoted his whole life to occultism, the latterabandoned occult practice and embraced Swedenborgianism. They were,however, at the end of the day, fellow thinkers. Inferno^ Chrisdan threatand its \"straws\" had to be crushed, but Crowley's choice of reviewingStrindberg is an expression of interest in his work.The praise of the scientific side of Infemo also opens the way foranother reading. If Infemo is \"a perfect clinical picture\" of the \"mental7. In the same letter, Strindberg gives a (vague) definidon of occuldsm as \"studiet af aliade fenomen som ej kunnat fbrneckas, men icke heller kunnat forklaras\" {Brev 285) [thestudy of all the phenomena which cannot be denied, but nevertheless remain inexplicable]."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"338 SCANDINAVLAN STUDIESdisease\" of the protagonist, his clumsy esoteric studies and search forknowledge from charlatans end up ruinous for both him and his sourcesof inspiration, i.e. for Crowley's enemies. Here Crowley's rhetoric isperfect in its ambiguity: he dismisses his adversaries while at the sametime saving the scientific foundation of Strindberg's esoteric approach,thus bringing grist to his own mill. Crowley's appreciation of Strindbergalways goes hand in hand with his personal interests.8. CROWLEY, STRINDBERG, AND RADICALISMThrough his years at Cambridge University and in the Golden Dawn,Crowley was gradually emancipated from his bourgeois background.This led him toward a critical attitude to his country and his societyon both rehgious and political levels; he started developing radicalpoints of view and found his arch enemy in Victorianism. Crowley'sdismissal of Christianity went hand in hand with his disdain for Vic-torian morality, which he often and violentiy attacked. As he puts it inthe Confessions, \"To us Victoria was sheer suffocation. While she livedit wotild be impossible to take a single step in any direction. She wasa huge and heavy fog; we could not see, we could not breathe\" (214).Even in his satirical sketch of Johan in the review of Son of a Servant,where the boy pretends to know everything about Gustavus Adolphusand then cannot do other than insult him, Crowley's unseemly refusalof the authority shines brightiy*Crowley's anti-Victorianism is evident in his reception of the worksof another Scandinavian writer, Henrik Ibsen. The space of this articledoes not allow for an accotint of the frequent references to Ibsen's worksin Crowley's writings, but a quick look at Ibsen's reception in Britainoffers some good interpretive keys and parallels with Strindberg's.Ibsen's British reception, which reached its peak in the early 1890s,8. It would be tempting to elaborate on the parallelism between Crowley's and Johan'srefusal of the traditional and patriarchal authority incarnated by the Swedish king andQueen Victoria. On tliis occasion, it might suffice to mention the episode of Crowley'sdiscover)' of Victoria's death. During a trip to Mexico in 1901, he and the mountainclimber Oscar Eckenstein \"went... to pay our respects to [a] Jefe Politico.... When hesaw us he assumed an air of sympathetic melancholy. We wondered what it could mean.By degrees he brought himself to break to us gently the terrible news. Queen Victoriawas dead! To the amazement of the worthy mayor, we broke into shouts of joy and animpromptu war dance\" (Confessions 214)."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OF STRINDBERG 339was polarized by a struggle between conservatism and radicalism. The\"Ibsen conttovers/' of the early 1890s mainly focused on Ibsen's immoraland decadent—if not explicidy feminist, atheist, and socialist—views,most of which were litde more than labels put on him by \"Ibsenites\"and \"Ibsenophobics.\" On a broader scale, the reception by Ibsen wassymptomatic of the struggle against the Victorian system of values,which would mount in Crowley a few years later. The British Ibsenwas made an icon of this movement, and his critique of the Europeanbourgeoisie was turned into a critique of Victorianism (Rem, Henry17-38). For Crowley, Ibsen was an ally in his batde against Victorian-ism {Confessions si, 44o), a batde which he often turned into a derisionof England and Englishmen—the \"natural-born fools in all matters ofthe soul\" (228), as he puts it in his review of Inferno. On the conttary,Ibsen \"had realised the changed and infinitely more complex conditionsof Hfe; our self-appointed spiritual guides notwithstanding, or, rather,withstanding in vain\" (Crowley, Tannhduser XII).Crowle/s reception of Ibsen allowed for a positive reading ofSttindberg, and the Swedish author had several advantages over Ibsenin the eyes of the English occultist. Sttindberg had a clear interest inesotericism, which Ibsen did not share, and diis interest was largelyinformed by science. Crowle/s scientific illuminism was but anotherform of his revolt against the Christian religion and Victorian, bourgeoissociety: on the one hand, the application of the scientific method tooccultism enabled him to overcome the pitfalls and dogmas of Chris-tian transcendence. On the other hand, claiming the primac)' of thescientific method in occult practice was a radical standpoint against apetit-bourgeois, amateurish approach to magic that he had experiencedamong the \"muddled middle-class mediocrities\" (Cow/£í5¿ow 169) of theGolden Dawn (Asprem 146). In addition, Sttindberg was a \"freethinker\"and had been married several times. For Crowley, freethinking and alibertine attitude were necessar}' conditions for spiritual and esotericdevelopment. If being a freethinker was the first step in a personal releasefrom the Christian yoke (and here Crowley positively assesses the factthat Sttindberg never converted to Catholicism), polygamy was hispreferred way of living and a way of magical practice. From 1912 on, infact, Crowley dedicated almost hiis entire occult effort to experiments inand die practice of sexual magic with the assistance of a great numberof lovers and adepts of botii sexes. Rather obviously, such experimentaland magical sex-ual activity went hand in hand with a liberation from"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"34O SCANDINAVIAN STUDIESChristian and Victorian morality. Crowley obviously did not viewStrindberg's turbulent series of marriages and relationships (on whichhe had probably received first hand and biased information from FridaUhl) as practices of sexual magic, but he supported it as a way of living.Crowley's remark on Strindberg's freethinking and multiple marriagesalso supports his anti-autobiographical reading of Son of a Servant andInfemo. The protagonist of Infemo might well have \"converted\" toSwedenborgianism, but, judging from Strindberg's later life, Crowleydoes not seem inclined to believe that this would be the case for theSwedish author as well. This is also evident in the exclamation \"Thereis no God!\" (\"Son\" 232) that Ctowley puts in Johan's mouth at theend of his rewriting of a scene from Son of a Servant. The exclamation,which is not present in the book, gives the passage a marked atheism.Crowley's skepticism about the authenticity of Strindberg's Christianfaith is what, in the end, saves Strindberg's reputation in his eyes: hemight have been an amateur occultist, he might have liked Sweden-borg, but at least he did not become a fervent Christian like his ficdvecharacter in Infemo.Crowley's judgment of Strindberg is ultimately, thus, more positivethan what appears in thelnfemo review. Strindberg's scientific approachto occuldsm and his free way of thinking were elements that made hima fellow thinker. If the protagonist's weakness and scant knowledgeof occultism failed to convince Crowley, this does not diminish theimportance of Strindberg for Crowlej^'s esoteric and radical agenda. Theharsh criticisms contained in the review must not be misunderstood assigns of dismissal—Crowley's contradictory nature did not distinguishbetween slander and appreciadon—but as reprimands to an ally in thesame batde. In 1912 and 1913, while Crowley was busy editing The Equinoxand quarreling with most of the French and British occultists, a greatsdt against Strindberg was mounting in the British press. As a result ofthe posthumous wave of transladons Strindberg was constandy beingattacked for being a misogynist and for the \"bmtality,\" \"fur)',\" and \"filth\"of his books (Ewbank 24). These remarks could not have done otherthan appeal to Crowley, whom Bridsh tabloids would later dub \"thewickedest man in the world\" (Kaczynski 394). If Chrisdanity broughthim away from Crowley, Strindberg's \"malaise... soul-searching, [and]psychological dissadsfaction\" {Confessions 104) still came from a kindredsoul in the spiritual and intellectual development of \"a man who soughtto be a Prophet for a dme that would have none\" (Sutin 419)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"AN OCCULT RECEPTION OF STRINDBERG 341APPENDIX• Aleister Crowley.
