Kadosh hat in der Gründung mehreren Freimauerlogen teilgenom-men und stand mit einer Reihe von wohlbekannten esoterischen und literarischen Persön-lischkeiten in Verbindung. Als sein System eine eklektische Mischung darstellte, wo dergriechische Gott Pan beispielsweise mit Gnostizismus, Freimauermystizismus und Lobprei-sungen von Luzifer verbunden wird, können verschiedene möglische Influenzen auf seineLehre angeführt werden. Es ist ganz unwahrscheinlich, daß Kadosch in seiner Zeit mehrereAnhänger gewonnen hat. Heutzutage sind aber seine Idéen von einer Gruppe rehabilitiertworden, die hauptsätzlich in Dänemark und Schweden aktiv ist. Wichtiger für die Anhängerdieser Gruppeerscheint die Verwendungvon Kadosh als ein Werkzeugum ihre eigene Wirk-samkeit Legitimität und historische Würzeln zu geben, als für die eigentliche Fortsetzungseiner Gedanken zu sorgen.KeywordsSatanism; Luciferianism; Denmark; Lucifer; Pan; GnosticismIt is often claimed there were no systematic attempts at creating a satanicideology before Anton LaVey founded the Church of Satan in . However,several such examplescan in fact be found, as I have shown in my bookMörkretsapostlar().Here I will focus on one of these pioneering early Satanists, the undoubtedlyobscure and marginal Danish dairy salesman, alchemist and Luciferian freema-son Ben Kadosh, whose real name was Carl William Hansen (–). Iwill also discuss how the teachings of Kadosh have undergone a somewhatunexpected renaissance in the satanic milieu of today."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –. A Luciferian PamphletKadosh was born in Copenhagen in , and came from a poor working-class background. His mother started receiving welfare checks when her sonwas nine years old, and was continuously on welfare from  until her deathin . For her funeral, the state paid the burial fee of  Danish crowns. Allthe same, her son apparently managed to acquire a certain level of educationand in his late twenties secured a job as a bookkeeper.1A few years later, he wasinitiated in the esoteric groupL’Ordre Martiniste,thefirstofavastnumberofsuch societies he would join in his life.2In , Kadosh published the pamphletDen ny morgens gry: verdens-bygmesterens genkomst(“The Dawn of a New Morning: The Return of theWorld’s Master Builder”). This unstructured and highly eccentric text presentsa type of Satanism that remains both original and confusing to this day. Mostcommentators agree that Kadosh was being deliberately obscure, one authordescribing his work like this: ‘It is written in a rather muddled language, andwhen the author in addition evidently has tried to give his words an abstruseoracular disguise, one understands that for the non-“illuminated”, i.e. the non-initiated, it is difficult to comprehend.’3The syntax of the text is odd, to saythe least, and the risk of misinterpretation thus becomes grave. Therefore, thefollowing “exegesis” must be read with these particular difficulties in mind.The purpose of the pamphlet is stated to be the spreading of the cult ofSatan/Lucifer, ‘the recruiting of proselytes’, hopefully leading to ‘the formation1)De tre søjler,Ved frimurerlogen, , Pedersen & Madsen, ‘Den Hellige Søn’, –.2)Lomholt,Vinkelfrimureriet, –. As Lomholt points out, it is perhaps doubtful ifKadosh received all of the initiations personally and in the cities he himself stated (Lyon,Berlin, Vienna, etc.), as it would most likely have been too expensive for him to travelso extensively. Lomholt directs several snide remarks towards Kadosh, making fun of hiscollection of Masonic patents and charters, and relates how he once asked Kadosh if he couldacquire a Chinese Masonic patent as well, something the latter deemed not unthinkable.Nothing more was then heard of it, and Lomholt wryly comments that perhaps the languagebarrier hindered correspondence with the Chinese Masons.Ibid., –.3)‘Den er affattet i et temmelig knudret sprog, og når hertil kommer at forfatteren bevidsthar forsøgt at give sine ord en dunkel orakelmæssig forklædning, forstår man, at den for deikke “illuminerede”, d.v.s. de ikke indviede, er vanskelig at fatte’. In the manuscript from theMasonic lodge De tre søjler, it is described as being authored in ‘an incredibly affected andpartly incomprehensible language’ (‘et usandsynligt forskruet og delvis uforstaaeligt Sprog’),whilst his other pamphlet is said to be written in ‘unreadable and hopelessly incorrectlanguage’ (‘ulaeseligt og haabløst ukorrekt Sprog’).

What, then, is this entityin fact? Lucifer, Kadosh lays down, ‘is the “Sum”—or Ego—of the materialnature, the creating Logon and Force!’, and both ‘personal and impersonal’,‘a true physical reality, though of a semi-material nature’ and ‘the potency ofthe forces in living matter, in an individually personified form, the “Sum” ofthe creating nature.’ Kadosh further states that ‘If one is in possession of thenecessary keys or knowledge’, it is possible to evoke or call him forth. Thoseinterested in these keys are encouraged to call on Kadosh personally in hishome, on Hjørringgade .5Later in the pamphlet, Kadosh quotes a long passage verbatim from CarlKohl’s bookSatan og hans kultus i vor tid(“Satan and his cult in our time”,), a popularly written overview of ideas about Satan and Satanism.6Withreference to Kohl’s description of Gnosticism, Kadosh states that his goat-godis a demiurge, the Father and Creator of this world. Then he makes a boldleap, identifying Satan with the Grand Architect Hiram from Masonic lore.7Such a correspondence is certainly not traditional in the Masonic context,and is a novel invention of Kadosh’s, perhaps with some inspiration from aninfamous French prankster (more of which shortly). According to Masoniclegend, Hiram was the master builder who erected the temple of Solomon,and was in possession of a secret word, or the secret correct pronunciation ofGod’s name. Early Masons made a rhetorical jump and identified Hiram withGod, the latter metaphorically being the “master builder” of the universe. Thecorrespondence with Lucifer, however, is entirely unknown amongst real-life4)‘hverve Proselyter’, ‘Dannelsen af en lukket Cirkel, nærmest i Form af en nyesoteriskFrimurer-Orden, der helt vilde hellige sig en Kultus i Lighed med de Gamles’, Kadosh,Denny morgens gry,.5)‘ganske uhjemlige i den kristelige Laere’, ‘De høre begge ene esoterisk Kultus og Magi til’,‘er den materielle Naturs “Sum”—eller Jeg—den skabende Logon og Kraft!’, ‘personelig ogupersonelig’, ‘en sand, fysisk Virkelighed, omend af halvmateriel Natur’, ‘Potensen af denlevende Materies Kraefter i individuel, personificeret Form, den skabende Naturs “Sum”’,‘Er man i Besiddelse af fornødne Nøgler eller Kundskaber’, Kadosh,Den ny morgens gry,–.6)Kadosh,Den ny morgens gry, , Kohl,Satan og hans kultus,–.7)Kadosh,Den ny morgens gry, ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –Masons.8In the realm of fantasy and satire, though, it had been heard of before.There is a possibility that the idea of Satan and Hiram being connected comesfrom Kohl’s recapitulation of the practical joker Leo Taxil’s first book, one ofmany he wrote to make fun of Catholic gullibility, where Hiram is crownedby Satan.9It is peculiar that Kadosh appears to have taken up some of Taxil’sfantasies about Masonic Luciferianism, in spite of the fact that Kohl details thebig scam and prank it all turned out to be.10Another passage in Kohl’s bookthat might have influenced Kadosh is his summary of Jules Bois’ description ofa Satanic temple, where a picture of Lucifer, designated “the world’s builder”(“Verdensbygmesteren”), hangs above the altar. This is followed by a footnotequoting a Catholic Abbé’s assertion that the Masonic Grand Architect is in factthe demiurge of the old Gnostics, Satan.11Kadosh’s Lucifer is hardly a character one would recognise from any real,practised esoteric system of his time. Nor would any of the antique Gnosticshave viewed the demiurge as his helping deity (but rather as an evil pseudo-God, or ignorant hinderer). The idea of a benevolent demiurge is a contradic-tion in terms in a Gnostic context. Most forms of Satanism that are heavilyinspired by Gnostic ideas tend to regard the demiurge as identical with theChristian god, whose enemy Satan is.12The Lucifer-demiurge ofDen ny mor-gens gryis thus an entirely original and odd figure, uniquely the creation—orrather, creative amalgamation—of the eccentric Dane.Lucifer is portrayed by Kadosh as a sort of rebelliousand “criminal” initiator,giving man access to mysteries that the Christian church has tried to keephidden. He is, according to Kadosh, a phallic and expansive personification ofenergy, which is why he is the nemesis of all attempts to confine and limit.13This vitalistic element links him to Eliphas Lévi’s Baphomet, whom the Frenchoccultist identified with the astral light, a sort of cosmic energy that flowsthrough the entire universe. It could also be considered part of the period’s8)On Hiram in the Masonic context, see Bogdan,From Darkness to Light, , –.9)Kohl,Satan og hans kultus, .10)Ibid., –.11)Ibid., –.12)Interestingly, a partly parallel view of Satan as abenevolent(if somewhat harsh)demiurge,can later be found in the writings of German esotericist Gregor A. Gregorius (EugenGrosche, –). It is unlikely, but not impossible, that Gregorius was aware ofKadosh’s ideas. It would, however, appear more likely that they could have a mutual sourcein some obscure neo-gnostic esoteric tradition, or that they came up with these thoughtsindependently of one another. On Gregorius, see Faxneld,Mörkrets apostlar, –.13)Kadosh,Den ny morgens gry, ."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –broader interest in vitalism, which had as its basis ideas formulated by FranzMesmer (–) and Carl Reichenbach (–). The source of alllife is, according to Kadosh, Lucifer’s father, ‘that which language does not haveany understandable pronounceable word for’. Lucifer himself is ‘the expressionof the unpronounceable’, i.e. his father, and the Luciferian cult should beviewed as centred on ‘the worship and adoration of [an] eternal,hidden, mightyor omnipotent force in nature’.14Satan, in other words, is the vehicle of thehidden, unknowable God, and the appropriate path for man to approach thismystery beyond words. God can only be known through his vessel, Lucifer.The fact that the latter is maligned by Christianity is therefore a tragedy thatKadosh sought to undo. In another section of the text, it is emphasized thatLucifer is not the ugly creature of man’s imagination, but ‘in fact he is beautifulin his dark apparent obscenity’.15. Pan the Goat GodBefore the actual text commences, there is a quotation from an Orphic Hymn,in which Pan is invoked.16Throughout the pamphlet, Lucifer/Satan is equatedwith Pan, and the resurrection of the ‘no longer dead’ great god Pan is a keytheme.17Kadosh’s description of Pan has characteristics—for instance, wings on hisback—which clearly signal that this is not simply the Greek god Pan, but amixture of this deity and the Devil of Christian lore, who also incorporatesfeatures of the Baphomet figure as conceived by Eliphas Lévi.18Equating Pan with Satan is nothing new. The Greek shepherd god, beinghalf man and half goat, is often considered the origin of the goat-like featuresof the Devil in Christian iconography.19A view of Pan as a demon can be foundalready in the writings of Eusebius (d. ce), and in Jean Bodin’s famousDela démonomanie des sorciers(“On the Demon-Mania of Witches”, ) he isnamed prince of the so-calledincubi, male sexual demons. Henry More, in his14)‘den som Sproget ikke ejer noget forstaaeligt udtaleligt Ord for’, ‘det uudtaleliges Udt-ryk’, ‘Dyrkelsen og Tilbedelsen af evig, forborgen, maegtig eller alt formaaende Naturkraft’,Ibid., .15)‘i Virkeligheden er han skøn i sin mørke tilsyneladende Obskønitet’,Ibid., .16)Ibid., .17)Ibid., ,passim.18)Ibid., .

A connection between Pan and Baphomet wasthus established.22The figure of Pan was immensely popular as a motif in poetry and prosearound the time whenDen ny morgens grywas written, especially in GreatBritain and the USA. Keats and Shelley had written about him back in theirday, and around the turn of the century Swinburne (in three of his late poems)and Wilde were hymning him. Occultists like Aleister Crowley were alsowriting Pan-poems, and practised an actual cult of Pan.23In short, Kadosh’spassion for Pan was something fairly typical for his time.Through an antique misunderstanding of the etymology of the word Pan,the god’s name was understood to be derived from the Greek word for “all”,and thus Pan came to be perceived as the soul of the world.24Such a view livedon past antiquity, and clearly influenced Kadosh. There was an ample literaryheritage concerning Pan available to him, and he was probably familiar withtexts like Coleridge’sBiographia Literaria(), where he speaks of Pan as amysterious god representing ‘intelligence blended with a darker power, deeper,mightier, and more universal than the conscious intellect of man’,25aphrasingstrikingly similar to some that can be found in Kadosh’s text.20)Merivale,Pan the Goat-God, –, –, , , .

Literary Friends and a Sinister ReputationWhat sort of a man, then, was this Satanic innovator? Perhaps the richestsource of information regarding Kadosh as a person is a lengthy memorialarticle by a friend of his, the writer Aage Welblund, published in the DanishnewspaperSocialdemokratenin . Here we can read about how Kadoshtried to persuade the Danish section of The Society for Psychical Research toassist him in summoning a salamander (fire elemental), as well as a delineationof the many interesting personal contacts Kadosh had.One of his acquaintances by correspondence was the Swedish author AugustStrindberg (–). Unfortunately, the letters they exchanged have allbeen lost, but there is documentation of their discussions in other lettersStrindberg wrote. In a letter addressed to Kadosh’s esoteric mentor, the Finnishnobleman August Walleen-Borneman, Strindberg complains that the secrecysurrounding Kadosh’s pleading for monetary assistance for his gold makingsmacks of humbug and charlatanism.26The main point of disagreement be-tween Strindberg and Kadosh would seem to be the latter’s insistence on keep-ing alchemy firmly grounded in classic esoteric-mystical speculation, whereasthe Swede propagated a gold-making process entirely based on methods glean-ed from contemporary natural science. On the last page of his pamphlet,Kadosh explains that the alchemical gold is in fact Lucifer, or is at the veryleast closely tied to him.27Therefore, the alchemical striving to create gold mustin Kadosh’s mind have been the equivalent of struggling towards or evokingLucifer, or embarking on a Luciferian quest for Satanic enlightenment. Such aview of things was naturally far removed from that of Strindberg.28Kadosh does not appear to have received any money from Strindberg, buta Danish nobleman in deep monetary trouble, grasping for straws, financedhis experiments for a while, and let him use a huge oven in the basement ofhis estate suitable for such proceedings. When the hoped-for results failed toappear, the alchemist was kicked out. According to him, this happened right on26)Strindberg,Brev, .27)Kadosh writes, among other things, that Lucifer is the “original principle” (“Urprincip”)of gold. Kadosh,Den ny morgens gry, .28)Strindberg did show some sympathy for the Devil in the mystery play incorporated inMäster Olof() andInferno(), and actually stated at one point that he used tobe a Satanist, but his alchemical practice bears no mark of these ideas.

Sadly, none of these letters are preservedeither. Authors were not the only celebrities Kadosh came into contact with.When Rudolf Steiner (–)—the founder of Anthroposophy—visitedCopenhagen, Kadosh paid a visit to his hotel room to discuss esoteric mat-ters. Steiner is supposed to later have said that ‘surrounding Kadosh’s personthere was an aura, that fully revealed that he was in communication with thepowers of darkness’.30Sinister stories also circulated about Kadosh being ableto magically attack his enemies regardless of distance, and it would seem hehimself did nothing to quench these rumours, since he actually rather enjoyedthem. Welblund confirms there was indeed a dark streak in Kadosh’s person-ality:Something demonic could occasionally come over his person and especially showeditself in his oral laying out of people’s horoscopes, where he revealed a very sharp eyefor people’s weak sides, which perhaps was connected to his predilection for the darkand disharmonic side of things.31Further such dark streaks appear in another source, in a passing mention of“psychic experiments” performed by Kadosh, where the intervention of otherparties was necessary to avoid a murder and a suicide.32Kadosh was some-what infamous in his own time, due to his pamphlet, the many rumours abouthim, and writings like Carl Kohl’s article in a daily newspaper, entitled ‘Er dersatanister i København?’ (“Are there Satanists in Copenhagen?”). Welblundquotes from the article, where we can learn how a Luciferian celebrates Christ-mas:29)Welblund, ‘Den sidste guldmager og kabbalist’.30)‘omkring Kadosh person stod en aura, der til fulde afslørede at han havde forbindelsemed mørkets magter’,Ibid.31)‘Noget dæmonisk kunne lejlighedsvis komme over hans person og kom i særlig gradfrem i hans mundtlige udlægninger af folks horoskoper, hvor han afslørede et meget skarptblik for menneskers svage sider, hvad der måske hang sammen med hans forkærlighed fortingenes mørke og disharmoniske side’,Ibid.32)De tre søjler,Ved frimurerlogen,."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –I can certify that there are also those here at home, who in the deepest earnestness havesummoned and conjured, and who believe to have seen and worshipped, the Church’sSatan, Baphomet, who is the black god of Kabbalah. While I write these lines I havebefore me a letter from a Danish Satanist and in it I read amongst others the followinglines: ‘While Europe celebrates Christmas for the “white Christ”, I celebrate it as a feastfor the highest one, the buck’s head ... I celebrate it as a feast for Baphomet, the hiddendivinity, whom I worship and worship again’.33Such Christmas-time celebrations of Baphomet would have been conductedin a rather prosaic home environment (if they took place in the family home,that is). Kadosh’s wife ran a small dairy store in the house where they lived,earning the family’s upkeep. Her husband devoted his time to occult activitiesand chemical experiments of a secular nature. In the kitchen of their smallapartment he tried, unsuccessfully, to manufacture, for instance, colour bandsfor typewriters.34Kadosh was unrelenting and firm in his convictions: In a national cen-sus of , he stated his religious affiliation to be “Luciferian”. The restof his family, his wife and two children, answered “Lutheran” to this ques-tion.35In , Kadosh issued another pamphlet,Rosea-Crucis: Rosen-Korset:Ars-Sapiens-Philosophia-Vita(“Rosea-Crucis: The Rose Cross: Art-Thinking-Philosophy-Life”), stating the author simply as “en Frater” (“a brother”). Herethere are no Satanic references, and the imagery is instead Christian for themost part. The wording regarding God—for instance the exhortation to ‘direct33)‘At der også findes dem herhjemme, der I deres sjæls dybeste alvor har påkaldt ogbesværget, og som tror at have set og tilbedt den kirkens Satan, Baphomet, der er kabbala’ssorte gud det kan jeg bevidne.

Their find-ings are presented in their introduction to the  edition ofDen ny morgens gry(Pedersen& Madsen, ‘Den Hellige Søn’). However, some slight inaccuracies can be found there; forinstance they state (pp. –) that the national census where Kadosh stated that he was a“Luciferian” took place in , the correct year in fact being  (as I found out when Ichecked the records myself)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –the flame within you towards God’36—is non-specific enough to be interpretedas referring to the master builder Lucifer of the previous pamphlet. And indeedthis last published writing ends with the Latin words ‘Per tenebres ad lumen!’(“Through darkness towards light!”),37which tie in nicely with his older ideasabout the dark entity Satan as a way to reach the true God.. Kadosh and Organized EsotericismIn William Hartmann’sWho’s Who in Occultism, New Thought, Psychism andSpiritualism(), Kadosh is listed as:Chemist, Author, Kabbalist, Astrologer, Patriarch and Primas, Naassenic Gnostic Syn-ode (Scandinavia), Grand Master General, Grand Orient of Denmark, President Al-chemical Society of Denmark; General Delegate and Hon. Member, Società AlchemicaItaliana; President, Kabbalistic Order (Denmark); Grand Master and General Delegate,Martinist Order, etc., etc.38It is interesting to note that Kadosh was also a member of Theodor Reuss’O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis), before the position as O.H.O. (Outer Headof the Order) was taken over by Aleister Crowley, and he eventually became itsleader in Denmark. Neither under his leadership nor under his successor didit however become Crowleyan.39Unfortunately, it is difficult to find detailed documentation concerningthe practical consequences of Kadosh’s involvement with the O.T.O. and thegroups mentioned in Hartmann’s book, but it is decidedly something worthpursuing in further Kadosh scholarship. For the time being, this aspect of hisactivities remains more or less veiled in obscurity due to a lack of availablesource material. It does not appear unlikely, however, that further archivalinvestigations will sooner or later yield more correspondence or other relevantmaterials pertaining to the matter. At the moment, we shall have to makedo with ascertaining that he was well-connected in the esoteric milieu of histime, and had many international contacts. A detailed comparison, discussinga possible influence on Kadosh from ideas propagated in these orders is beyond36)‘ret Flammen indenfor Dig mod Gud’. “en Frater”,Rosea-Crucis, .37)“en Frater”,Rosea-Crucis, .38)Hartmann,Who’sWho in Occultism, . There is also a separate listing for “The Naassenic(Ophitic) Gnostic Synode”, whose Patriarch & Primas is Kadosh,Ibid., .39)http://user.cyberlink.ch/~koenig/sunrise/hansen.htm"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –the scope of the present article, but also something that ought to be treated infuture scholarship.There is no direct indication that any of the many other orders Kadosh wasinvolved with had Luciferian leanings, except perhaps for the Naasenic GnosticSynod. The antique Naasene Gnostics considered, if we are to believe thedescriptions we have of them, the serpent in the Garden of Eden a messengerof the true god, sent to help mankind break free from the illusions and liesof the demiurge. In other words, they had a positive view of a Biblical figureconsidered by mainstream Christian tradition to be the Devil. Since the Neo-Gnostic group that Kadosh led as “Patriarch & Primas” took their inspirationfrom the Naasenes it is not a wild assumption that there might have existedcertain receptivity in this context for his Luciferian ideas. However, how manymembers Kadosh’s group had is not known, and it may very well have beena minuscule synod consisting of one or two persons, with no actual “church”to rule over (the term synod usually denotes the ruling body of a church). Amanuscript from one of Kadosh’s Masonic lodges states, in a passage regardingthe Luciferian pamphlet, that ‘His goal was to establish a Luciferian-Gnostic“congregation” with himself as “patriarch”, but he naturally never managedto.’40There is a slight possibility that this statement may not be entirely true, if weconsider the small occult circle (“et slags okkult broderskap”) Kadosh launchedtogether with two other men: the Swedish shoemaker N.A. Wessmann, whowas attempting to build aperpetuum mobile, and the student of astrologyVilhelm Jespersen. They were later joined by the illustrator Niels Wivel (–), famed for his humorous drawings.41Whether or not this little groupwere heeding the call fromDen ny morgens gry, to create a Luciferian ‘closedcircle, almost under the form of a newesotericOrder of Freemasons’,42andwere in effect a Satanist clique, is not possible to tell from Welblund’s account.40)‘Hans Maal var at faa oprettet en luciferiansk-gnostisk “Menighed” med sig selv som“Patriark”, men det lykkedes ham naturligvis aldrig.’ De tre søjler,Ved frimurerlogen,.It appears he might occasionally have tried to sneak some Luciferian elements into themore conventional Masonic groups, like when he was allowed to invoke the high Demiurge(“Høje Demiurg”)—in Kadosh’s worldview of course meaning Lucifer—at an opening andclosing of the lodge De tre søjler in .Ibid., .41)Welblund, ‘Den sidste guldmager og kabbalist’.

Kadosh as a Character in Literary WorksNot only did Kadosh correspond with famous authors in other countries, healso got portrayed several times in literary works by his countrymen. He firstappeared in J.I. Kronstrøm’s novelDen gyldne kunst(“The Golden Art”, ),and then in J. Anker Larsen’sDe vises sten(“The Philosopher’s Stone”, ).One of Denmark’s most famous authors, Hans Scherfig (–),48immortalized Kadosh by depicting him in his two novelsIdealister(“Idealists”,43)Lomholt,Vinkelfrimureriet, –, –, . Lomholt’s hostile retelling ofevents should perhaps be takencum grano salis, but even if Kadosh would appear to havebeen a sincere mystic in many respects, thereis also doubtless some truth to Lomholt’sdescription of him as an opportunistic peddler of irregular Masonic patents. On Lomholt’svitriolic attacks on (according to him) irregular Masonic groups in Denmark, launchedmainly through the evening press, and the eventual outcome of his actions, see De tre søjler,Ved frimurerlogen, .44)Circular letter addressed to all Danish Masonic lodges, .

InIdealisterwe can read about how Kadoshgets carried away by his esoteric rituals, conducted in an attic room abovethe family’s dairy store, wildly swinging a little sword made out of cardboardand wearing a hat fashioned from an old margarine container, decorated withpentagrams and magical characters. His loud incantations sometimes disturbthe customers who come to buy dairy products, and his wife tries to persuadehim to calm himself—but to no avail, as her husband keeps struggling withthe invisible powers and swinging his cardboard sword, which he pompouslyrefers to as “Shibulah”.49Welblund states that much of the novel’s depiction of Kadosh is based onreal facts, but of course it is after all a literary text first and foremost. Thisgoes for the portrayals by Kronstrøm and Larsen as well. The portraits have allthe same become part of the legend surrounding Kadosh, and he emerges assuch an uncommonly ridiculous guru that you would think it unlikely anyonewould want to revere him as his or her esoteric master.. A Luciferian RenaissanceReading Kadosh’s pamphlets further strengthens the impression that this per-son was, to put it bluntly, a somewhat laughable eccentric. His writing style isdecidedly obscure and incompetent, the ideas bizarre (or very original, depend-ing on your point of view) and his way of reasoning often difficult to follow (orvery mystical and profound, again depending on your perspective). A num-berofpeopleinourowntimehavechosentoadoptthepositivestanceinthis question, and a small group of esotericists—Michael Bertiaux and BjarneSalling Pedersen, with assistance from I.M. Berg—formed The Neo-LuciferianChurch (hereafter the NLC) on Candlemass . On the NLC website, itis stated that in certain circles there had been a wish ever since the s‘to re-establish a Danish Luciferian Church and carry on the magical cur-rent from Carl William Hansen’.50Bertiaux is an author who is well-knownin the Thelemic and left-hand-path sections of today’s esoteric milieu, andwho is head of a staggering number of interrelated organizations (not entirelyunlike Kadosh, in this respect). There are Luciferian elementsto be found in histeachings, and some of these may have their origins in the nineteenth-century49)Scherfig,Idealister, –. InIdealister, Kadosh is one of the main characters. InFrydenholm, on the other hand, Kadosh’s appearance is limited to a single page.

Even now, things appear not tohave gotten off to a flying start immediately back in . But Kadosh’s namedid start to become better known, especially among Scandinavian esotericists.Thus, the ground was to some extent prepared for starting an organisationbased on his creed. In  a new Danish-language edition ofDen ny morgensgrywas published, and a Swedish translation is presently in preparation. TheNLC has managed to attract a handful of members in Denmark since it firststarted, and recently a Swedish congregation was established as well. In total,the number of members is around –. Membership is by invitation only,and most members are people in their s and s, typically with an educationin the humanities at university level.53It is interesting to note how strong the cult of Kadosh’s person appears tobe, and also how this necessitates an ironical approach from his followers—heis after all a rather ludicrous character.54The Church sells coffee mugs andnotebooks with a photo of Kadosh on them, stating that the first of these51)Lewis,Satanism Today, –. Bertiaux is a fascinating and original (some would saybizarre) writer, who is yet to receive any real scholarly attention. Lewis’ brief mention ofhim is one of very few in scholarly literature.52)Fr.

(E-mail to the author from Rev.Proprophegge, --).54)This is the impression one gets when perusing the material, though it is worth notingthat Pedersen, when I asked him what role Kadosh plays, answered: ‘Kadosh plays no role asa special “saint” or anything similar. We’re equally inspired by such people as Herman Hesse,Bulwer-Lytton, Aleister Crowley or Eliphas Levi + dozens more.’ (E-mail to the author fromBjarne Salling Pedersen, --) Another member, Rev.

Proprophegge, --). Itmay seem inappropriate for a historian of religion to label an object of study a ‘ludicrouscharacter’ (even if this fact is fairly evident and uncontroversial, and he was considered so"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –items is intended for ‘the occult geek’.55Humour permeates other areas ofthe Church as well, and certainly not every Satanic order would have a quote(from one of the members) like ‘Come join the dark side/we’ve got cookies’on their homepage.56Atthesametime,theNLCispayingfortheupkeepofKadosh’s grave, and seems to perceive his ideas in deadly earnest. Neither isthere anything particularly humorous about their Luciferian creed, which iswritten in a typically bombastic Satanic style.57. Strategies of Legitimation within the Neo-Luciferian ChurchWhat, then, can be gained from having a guru who died way back in ?For one thing, we have to remember that Satanism as a systematic teachingcannot really be found prior to the ideas presented by Stanislaw Przybyszewskiaround the year , and no one has yet tried to appropriate him as aprominent predecessor. Therefore, having a holy writ published as early as makes a Satanist group remarkably and uniquely grounded in traditionand history. Kadosh’s pamphlet could even reasonably be said to be the veryfirst consistently Satanicesoterictext (Przybyszewski’s Satanism was of a morephilosophical type).58Many Satanists, such as the ONA, claim to be thecustodians of an ancient tradition. But in fact, none of them have solid evidenceto back these claims. The NLC actually do have a canonical writing that is over years old. In a way, they could thereby be said to be the “most traditional”Satanist group in the world, since they have a (relatively speaking) genuinelyold Satanic teaching as their basis. However, it is not a case of an unbrokenline of transmission, but rather of reviving an esoteric heritage that had lainby many of his contemporary peers), but I do so here to make a rhethorical point: that the(obvious) tragicomical aspects of Kadosh’s person necessitate a special approach when he isappropriated by today’s esotericists.55)http://www.cafepress.co.uk/nlcmarket, where it is also possible to buy things like a‘Satanic BBQ Apron—for the true gourmet’ (could do double duty as a Masonic apron,perhaps?), a ‘Neo-Luciferian Cap of Invisibility’ and ‘Anti-Christian Boxer Shorts—f*ckingsexy’. Even if Pedersen underscores that Hesse, Crowley et al are just as important to theNLC, things like the merchandise on offer make it clear that Kadoshdoeshave a specialposition.56)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/members/members.html57)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/text/creed-english.pdf58)Though there are sympathies for the Devil in the writings of Blavatsky and to someextent Lévi, neither of them develops this into a major theme. On Lévi and Blavatsky, seeFaxneld,Mörkrets apostlar, –."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –dormant for a couple of generations. The oldest Satanist group, if we countage in terms of unbroken tradition, still remains the Church of Satan, foundedin .59The NLC recommends ‘all members and applicants to start a general studyin the Western Occult Tradition’, naming authors like Eliphas Lévi, MichaelBertiaux, Dion Fortune, S. MacGregor Mathers, Israel Regardie, AleisterCrowley, Francis King, Kenneth Grant and Austin Osman Spare as suitablereading.60Crowley in particular seems to be of great importance, since  ofhis texts can be found translated into Danish on the NLC homepage. Also,Crowley’s most famous dictum (‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of theLaw.Loveisthelaw,loveunderwill.’)isdisplayedonthefrontpageoftheweb-site, which is also decorated with the Crowleyan unicursal hexagram.61This isone of the many modifications and additions to the teachings of Kadosh thatwe can observe. It is obvious that he is certainly not the sole source of inspira-tion for his present-day heirs. This would naturally be a bit difficult, given thathis writings total no more than  small pages (counting both pamphlets), arather slim canon for any religion to make do with.Somewhat surprisingly, there are few explicit references to Kadosh’s writingson the homepage (the only one is in fact a quotation fromDen ny morgens gryat the top of “The Neo-Luciferian Manifesto”),62but quite a few to AleisterCrowley, as well as scattered references to the writings of authors like theMason Albert Pike, the amateur folklorist Charles G. Leland and EliphasLévi. It is possible to find some parts of the actual ideology that seem to bevaguely inspired by Kadosh, though. In “The Neo-Luciferian Manifesto” thefifth item (“Lucifer is a primeval force”) talks of Lucifer as ‘a personified, aswell as abstract, reality’, echoing what Kadosh writes in his pamphlet.63In“The Neo-Luciferian Creed” (note ) it is stated that: ‘Lucifer is the deity offreedom and a natural enemy towards them that enslaves [sic] man and beast.59)That is, unless one would want to categorize Fraternitas Saturni as still being Satanists. Itwould seem, though, that they have distanced themselves from such ideas since the death ofGregor A. Gregorius, who was probably largely responsible for the strongly Satanic contentof some early texts and ritual practices.Ibid., –.60)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/members/members.html61)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/text/text.html. As mentioned, Kadosh was a mem-ber of the pre-Crowleyan O.T.O., but never became associated with the later Crowleyanversion of the order.62)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/manifest/nl-manifest-uk.pdf63)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/manifest/nl-manifest-uk.pdf"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –Lucifer has some element of rebellion and anarchy, a kind of civil disobedienceagainst claimed authorities.’64This is similar to Kadosh’s words about Luciferas the opponent of those, for instance the Christian church, who want to keeppeople in ignorance, but it is also a phrasing of such a general nature that itdoes not necessarily point towards an influence from him.65It would thereforeseem that the function of Kadosh, at least judging by the material on displayfor the non-initiated, is mostly as a link to history, one of many strategic toolsemployed to underline the authenticity, legitimacy and high age of the spiritualcurrent represented by the NLC.The NLC claims to be the successor to a number of different churches, someof the gnostic-magical variety and some belonging to traditional Christian-ity. Twenty-one such churches are listed on their homepage, among them theVintrasian Carmelite Church, the Boullanian Carmelite Church, the LiberalCatholic Church and, surely to the surprise of some, the Russian OrthodoxChurch and the Syrian Orthodox Church. The  succession lines are meticu-lously documented on the homepage, with a detailed separate PDF documentavailable for each of them.66This underscores the great importance attachedwithin the NLC to tradition and ancient lineages as a means to create legiti-macy, something that is in fact rather typical of the esoteric milieu in general.67It is mainly as yet another such instrument that Kadosh seems to be utilized.64)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/text/creed-english.pdf65)Pedersen is, of course, right, however, when he writes (in response to a question fromme regarding to what extent the ideology of the NLC is inspired by Kadosh): ‘to be lookingfor Kadosh in the written material of the NLC is like looking for a ghost—not least becauseKadosh’s work ain’t exactly filled [with] plain statements suited for quotation’ (E-mail to theauthor from Bjarne Salling Pedersen, --). Rev. Proprophegge answered the samequestion by stating that ‘Kadosh’s writings have influenced us I would say primarily throughthe luciferian ideology, which we have translated into our rites and rituals, ceremonies andconsecrations. This can be seen e.g. in our statement of faith’ (E-mail to the author fromRev. Proprophegge, --).66)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/church/church.html67)Rev. Proprophegge underscores that ‘even here we have divergence among the membersof the church, where some have a preference for the gnostic illumination per se and say thatthe lineages are of lesser value to the personal illumination, there are others that put a valuein the apostolic and gnostic consecrations as means of boosting the personal illumination (akind of initiation, or perhaps more correctly a ‘consecration’), and see a value in being a linkin the chain of wandering bishops in order to continue moving the light through the agesfor current and future generations (a kind of “illuminator custodian” if you will)’ (E-mailto the author from Rev. Proprophegge, --)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –In his groundbreaking bookLegitimating New Religions(), the firstfull-length study of the topic, James R. Lewis draws on Weber and groupslegitimation strategies into charismatic appeals, rational appeals and traditionalappeals.68To some extent,Kadosh, even if he is a historical figureand long sincedead, could be said to possess charisma as a visionary. Rationality is not overtlyinvoked by the NLC, but tradition very much is, as we have seen. Lewis doesnot underscore continuity as an essential element of tradition, but the NLCdoes seem to attach great importance to this, considering their preoccupationwith succession lines. On the other hand, they freely admit to having revived adormant tradition when they elevated Kadosh as one of their most importantgurus. The comparatively (in the context of Satanism) high age of his teachingsmakes him important for reasons thay may be, in Lewis’ words, ‘based ona deep pattern in the human psyche that tends to regard ancient origins asparticularly sacred.’69Other Satanist groups have tried to bolster their teachingswith references to archaic religions from ancient cultures (Egypt, Sumeria, etc).But as far as actual Satanism (understood as a religious system celebrating theDevil) goes, Ben Kadosh is as ancient as it gets.When Anton LaVey wroteThe Satanic Bible(), he constructed hislegitimacy primarily by basing his religion on a rational secularist worldviewunderpinned by natural science, coupled with suggestions about mysteriousforces that today may seem like magic, but will eventually be scientificallycomprehended. In the development of the Church of Satan after LaVey’s death,the focus shifted to tradition instead, and the writings of LaVey have acquireda status as quasi-scripture.70The NLC use Kadosh in a considerably freermanner, and no member is ever likely to bash someone over the head withacopyofDen ny morgens gryin a debate. But even if the NLC stress thatthey are undogmatic and unhierarchic, for instance describing their creed as‘a work-thesis rather than a dogmatic comprehension of reality’,71it is worthkeeping in mind Olav Hammer’s words that ‘the construction of traditionis indeed a question of taking the right to speak authoritatively.’ Hammerfurther explicates that when ‘a spokesperson uses a discursive strategy’, such astradition, ‘rather than a more formal demonstration to support the claim thathis or her interpretations should be a valid grid through which others could68)Lewis,Legitimating New Religions, –.69)Ibid., .

The NLC, firmlyplanted in the same section, also take a more “oldfashioned” approach. Still,tradition is by no means the only strategy of legitimation employed by theNLC. Some references, mostly vague, to the other two strategies discussed byHammer—(narratives about) experience, appeals to rationality and science—are also present. Still, the appeal to tradition is by far the most prominent strat-egy visible to an outsider. Worth noting in this context are also the referencesto Secret Chiefs or Hidden Masters in the Neo-Luciferian creed: ‘Thus, fromtime to time, Prophets arise on earth, claiming to have had contact with theseSecret Chiefs or Hidden Masters, and with their results and success, renderprobable that they have had access to non-human intelligence and insight.’74However, a discussion of this interesting motif, well-known from Theosophyand several later groups, goes beyond the goals of the present article, whichfocuses specifically on the legitimation strategies related to Ben Kadosh (evenif he, of course, implicitly can be assumed to be one of the prophets mentionedin the quote).. ConclusionThis article has shown that, contrary to what is often stated, there existedsystematic attempts to formulate a Satanic teaching long before the Churchof Satan was founded in . It is plain, however, that such early Satanismshad extremely limited long-term influence, and clearly Ben Kadosh did notcreate a Satanism anywhere near as influential as LaVey’s.72)Hammer,Claiming Knowledge, .73)Ibid., .74)http://www.neoluciferianchurch.org/text/creed-english.pdf"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –As has often been the case with Satanism, authors of fiction have played animportant part in nourishing and preserving the legend of Kadosh. He himselfseems to have drawn on fictional accounts of Satanism, in his likely borrowingsfrom Taxil’s books. Kadosh’s Satanism is, as has been demonstrated, very mucha product of its time, with components lifted from vitalism, masonic lore, andthe contemporary enthusiasm for Gnosticism and the Greek god Pan. Theresulting conglomerate is highly idiosyncratic, obscure and difficult to grasp—even for an esoteric system. In part, this is caused by an exceptionally oddwriting style.It is surprising to note that Kadosh appears not to have been universallyscorned and rejected by his peers in spite of being a fairly outspoken Satanist.This indicates an unexpected potential openness to such ideas in the esotericmilieu of his era, that suggests a greater probability that systematic Satanismmay have deeper and wider historical roots than is commonly assumed.Ultimately, as far as Kadosh is concerned, it should still be stressed that hewas a local eccentric, whose ideas did not, it seems, during his lifetime spreadmuch further than his hometown. His specifically Satanic ideas perhaps didn’tattract any followers at all. But it is definitely possible to imagine there mayhave been others like him elsewhere around the same time. As Satanists con-tinue to search for their historical roots, and scholars with an interest in olderforms of Satanism could be said to be assisting them,75it appears likely thatother rare specimens of the Kadosh variety will eventually be found. Hereby,unprecedented possibilities will be created for Satanists to look backwards inhistory for inspiration, in a more tangible way than making vague referencesto Satanic witch cults in the Middle Ages (that historians doubt ever existed)and secret (previously unheard of and in all likelihood imaginary) hereditarytraditions, as has previously typically been the strategy of choice.Judging from what we can observe in the case of the NLC, such more orless newly unearthed predecessors need not have an ideology that is fully suitedto the needs of our time in order to be useful as a strategic tool for sataniclegitimization. It is fully sufficient that they were praisers of Satan and had atleastsomeideas that are deemed appropriate.75)I have spoken to several Satanists who had never heard of Kadosh before they read abouthim in my bookMörkrets apostlar, but who were now very enthusiastic about his work.Scholars should not underestimate the impact their writings may potentially have on thereligious groups they are studying (in this case, though, the impact is most likely marginal,but it still strikes me as both somewhat amusing and potentially problematic)."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Per Faxneld / ARIES . () –As Lewis’ study of the Church of Satan after the demise of LaVey shows,tradition provides legitimacy in the Satanic milieu just like in most othercontexts. Such legitimation strategies are always closely bound up with issuesof power, even in the case of a nonhierarchical and undogmatic group like theNLC. This should not be misconstrued as a claim that this group’s leadershipis exceedingly hungry for power and wants to gain uncritical followers bowingto their word. Rather, an appeal to tradition is a completely natural part ofan emerging religious group’s endeavours to establish the legitimacy neededto solidify their position and emphasize what makes them (more) valid andworthwhile in comparison to their competitors in the field.BibliographyBogdan, H.,From Darkness to Light: Western Esoteric Rituals of Initiation(diss.), Göteborg:Institutionen för religionsvetenskap, Göteborgs Universitet .Clymer, R.S.,The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America: Authentic and Spurious Organizations,Volume II, Quakertown, PA: The Rosicrucian Foundation .Coleridge, S.T.,Biographia Literaria, Vol. II, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton UniversityPress .“en Frater” [Hansen, C.W.],Rosea-Crucis: Rosen-korset: Ars-Sapiens-Philosophia-Vita,Kø-benhavn: Eget Forlag .Faxneld, P.,Mörkrets apostlar: satanism i äldre tid, Sundbyberg: Ouroboros .Fr.
