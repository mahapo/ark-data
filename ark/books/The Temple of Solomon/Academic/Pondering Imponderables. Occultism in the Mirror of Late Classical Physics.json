Selon tant des porte-parole de l’ésotérisme moderne que certains«scholars», cette rupture aurait, en outre, rendu la science davantage susceptible d’accueillirfavorablement la spéculation ésotérique. Comme d’ordinaire, les choses ont pu se présen-ter de façon un peu plus complexe. Le présent article, qui repose sur l’historiographierécente des sciences physiques, montre que ce ne fut pas seulement après Bohr, Heisen-berg, Pauli, et al., que des ésotéristes se sontmontrés capables d’établir un dialogue serréet semi-convaincant avec la physique de pointe. Contrairement à l’idée reçue, la vision«mécaniste-matérialiste» de la physique du XIXè siècle peut n’avoir pas été aussi fermée àla spéculation métaphysique que sa réputation le laisse entendre.

For instance, Olav Hammer has noted that ‘the mesmerist use ofthe vocabulary and theories of physics’ and the abundance of references toquantum mechanics and relativity theory in New Age discourse are quite welldocumented trends, while ‘[t]he history of the intermediate period ... is anunder-explored theme’.2This gap, which also spans the ‘intermediate period’between “classical” and “modern” physics, is certainly conspicuous, for it isa period which spawned some syntheses of esoteric and scientific discoursethat have been highly influential in modern esotericism. Hammer concernshimself mainly with writers in the neo- and post-Theosophy movements,especially Charles W. Leadbeater (–), Alice Bailey (–),and Edgar Cayce (–). However, one could easily expand the list,first by including associated figures such as Annie Besant (–) andRudolf Steiner(–),thenby going backwardsin history totheclassicalTheosophy of Blavatsky, Olcott, Sinnett and others, and lastly by looking atneighbouring discourses such as spiritualism and psychical research.31)See especially Wouter J.

Hammer elucidates this largelyunder-researched current by lookingparticularly at Alice Bailey’sThe Consciousness of the Atom(), writtenas a series of lectures for her schismatic Arcane School in –, andrelating it to the original Theosophy of Blavatsky and the neo-Theosophy ofLeadbeateret al. What remains missing from the analysis, however, is a deeperengagementwith the actual scientific context in relation to which these authorswere positioning themselves.Providing scientific contextfor this “intermediaryage” is the main objective of the current article. First, however, we should takea closer look at the “atomic metaphysics” observed by Hammer.InThe Consciousness of the AtomBailey considers some of the scientific devel-opments in descriptions of the atom, which, at the time of writing, was beingsubdivided into the constituent parts of electrons and nucleus, and she makesan effort to harmonise these models with her take on Theosophical cosmology.5In the process she quotes several th-century physicists. Indeed, Hammerobserves that Bailey’s esoteric exegesis of atomic physics rests on two centralideas, which later enjoyed very different fates in esoteric discourse: ‘the con-cept of the aether as the primeval stuff of the cosmos’ on the one hand, and‘the belief that the concept of matter itself is being superseded by the conceptsof force and energy’ on the other.6Following her neo-Theosophical predeces-sors, Bailey interpreted the physical atom as being ultimatelya manifestation ofa more fundamental etheric substance, a substance which was the intermediaryseat of all the energy in the universe.7As Hammer rightly notes, the referenceof Telepathy.

Meanwhile the concept of “energy” (and itscorresponding plural) would reach inflationary levels in New Age and relateddiscourses.Hammer goes on to comment about Bailey’s interpretations of matter that‘[i]t is as if a linguistic revision of the term “matter” would exorcise materi-alism’.8At this point, a couple of objections arise. As I will demonstrate inthe present article, the revisions are not really novel to Bailey, not even toTheosophists or other occultists; rather, the redefinition of matter in terms ofmore fundamental substances or processes arose within physics proper. Fromthis it also follows that the revisions were notmerelylinguistic tricks. In thecontext of physics, attempts to understand matter in terms of ether or evenelectromagnetism resulted from physical models based on mathematical for-malisations, theory-building, and the challenge of puzzling experimental data.Duringthedecadesbeforetheestablishmentof therelativitytheoriesandquan-tum mechanics, several research programmes existed which tried to reducematter to more fundamental processes. In the English-speaking world, etherphysics was a strong and highly successful programme, ultimately giving rise toMaxwell’s equations and the foundation of classical electrodynamics. Towardsthe end of the th century and well into the th various attempts were madeby continental physicists to get rid of the primacy not only ofmatterbut alsomechanics, by developing a worldview in which matter was reducible to purelyelectromagnetic phenomena. Furthermore, it is important to note that ideaslike these were closer to the “centre” than the “margin” of scientific discourse;9Lord Kelvin (William Thomson; –) was a central reference point forether models of matter, while Hendrik A. Lorenz (–) promoted theelectromagnetic worldview.10This, of course, does not mean that Theosophists were inscribed in thesame programme as these esteemed scientists. The goals, methods, and modesof reasoning were clearly different. Hammer is entirely correct in noting the8)Hammer,Claiming Knowledge, .9)A good discussion of the centre/margin distinction in th-century science is availablein Alex Warwick, ‘Margins and Centres’.

To do this, we need tomerge the literature on esotericism with the history of modern science. Thepresent article is a contribution to this wider project.In part one I will describe the birth and development of Victorian etherphysics, leading up to the many puzzling discoveries in late-classical physicsaround the turn of the century. In this discussion, I will particularly look at therelation between three conceptual developments, namely ether, matter and theemerging concept of electromagnetism—which itself subsumed the three con-cepts of electricity, magnetism, and light. As was already signalled, the devel-opment of these concepts in late-classical physics is a largely overlooked con-text for esoteric thought in the th and early th centuries. Part two moveson to connect the scientific and esoteric discourses, by focusing particularlyon the concept of ether. The concept of ether and the various theories of itsrelation to matter and electromagnetism in late-classical physics provided anentry point for occultists, spiritualists and (especially) psychical researchers atthe end of the th century. In the third part this focus continues by look-ing in more detail at a specific blending of scientific and esoteric discourse,namely the development of the concept of “etheric bodies”. While coming outof an esoteric discourse on subtle bodies with ancient roots, the concept ofthe etheric body made use of specifically th-century scientific discourses onmatter, ether and electromagnetism, even profiting from the occasional directcooperation of some distinguished physicists.11)Hammer,Claiming Knowledge, .

Ether and Matter in Victorian PhysicsThe Birth of Ether Physics: A Short OverviewIt has been argued that the word “ether” sums up all that physics was aboutin Britain during the second half of the th century.12Ether had been re-habilitated by natural philosophers to support the wave theory of light, whichgained the upper hand on the corpuscular models around . Luminiferousether, the purported medium of light, was thought to extend everywherein theuniverse, undetectable and subtle, yet mechanically active. Its supposed spatialomnipresence soon made it attractive as a heuristic entity to other disciplinesthan optics. Over the course of the century,the etherconcept came to permeatevarious theories of matter, electricity, and magnetism as well.The concept of ether has a long and varied history, stretching back toGreek antiquity.13Aristotle conceived of the substanceof thesupra-lunar worldin terms ofaithér, understood as the “first body” and thequinta essentia,akind of perfectUrstoff. From antiquity throughout the Middle Ages, intothe Renaissance and the Early Modern periods, different kinds of ethers wereinvented and invoked to perform a great variety of cosmological and physicalfunctions. Here we should restrict ourselves to the immediate backgrounds forthe th-century debates.Newton’s works at the close of the th century are generally consideredthe culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the settlement of classicalphysics. Although Newton’s natural philosophy gave models that were farmore complete than their predecessors, there were still some significant gaps.Even despite his famous claim to “feign no hypotheses” (hypotheses non fingo),Newton’sOpticks(), especially in queries added to the  edition, had12)See Goldberg, ‘In Defense of Ether’, . For discussions on the scientific theories ofether in the th century and its many possible functions, see Daniel M. Siegel, ‘Thomson,Maxwell, and the Universal Ether in Victorian Physics’; P.M. Harman, ‘Energy, Force, andMatter’; Hunt,The Maxwellians. The standard historical studyof scientific ether theoriesgenerally remains Edmund T. Whittaker,A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity(two volumes), but should be supplemented by the essays in G.N. Cantor & M.J.S. Hodge(eds.),Conceptions of Ether. In addition a number of articles discussing the wider culturalsignificance of Victorian ether theories have cropped up in recent years. See especiallyNoakes, ‘Ethers, Religion and Politics in Late-Victorian Physics’; idem, ‘The World of theInfinitely Little’; Grean Raia, ‘From Ether Theory to Ether Theology’.13)For a concise discussion of the history of ether theories, including the antique context,see Cantor & Hodge’s elaborate ‘Introduction’ toConceptions of Ether."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –left natural philosophers with several underdeveloped ether theories to explainthe reflection and refraction of light, even attempts at a theory of gravity usingether as the sustaining concept.14During the following century, theories onvarious “subtle fluids” flowered. Benjamin Franklin (–) postulatedan elastic ether to account for electricity, while George Le Sage’s (–)kinematic ether was offered as explanation for a wide range of phenomena,from gravity and weight to chemical affinity. The result was a tapestry of ethers,performing a range of different and poorly understood functions.15Despite all these attempts it was only in the early decades of the th cen-turythat a more consistent and, with time, unifiedresearch programme of etherphysics started to take shape. As mentioned, this development was intimatelyconnected with the re-emergence of the wave theory of light, sparked by thework of Augustin-Jean Fresnel (–), Siméon Denis Poisson (–) and Thomas Young (–).16Whilewavetheorieshadbeenpro-posed earlier, notably by Christian Huygens (–) and Leonard Euler(–), until now the Newtonian corpuscular model had enjoyed thefavour of natural philosophers in the field of optics. By the s, however,proponents of the wave model could claim new experimental data to back uptheir views, namely Young’s celebrated double-slit experiment,which hadsuccessfully produced an interference pattern between two beams of light.Common sense dictates that any wave needs a medium, and the establish-ment of the wave theory came with the philosophical problem of explaininghow wavesof lightmay propagate through seeminglyemptyspace. Tosolve thisproblem it became increasingly attractive to infer the hypothesis of a “luminif-erous ether”, an unseen, subtle optical medium through which light wavestravel. The scientific legitimacy of ether was thus reinforced by a process ofhypothetical inference and deduction, rather than direct observation.While it arose as a supporting hypothesis for optics, the ether soon attractedadditional significance. The development of electromagnetic theory aroundthe middle of the century greatly expanded ether physics’ area of application.During the first half of the th century researchers in a number of countrieswere experimenting with electricity and magnetism, pushing towards a unified14)See, e.g., P.M. Heimann, ‘Ether and Imponderables’, .15)For overviews, Cantor & Hodge, ‘Introduction: Major themes in the development ofether theories from the ancients to ’.

Faraday’s experiments with elec-tromagnetismwereof greatimportancein this development,butthe realbreak-through came with James Clerk Maxwell’s (–) suggestion that lightwaves were reducible to electromagnetic activity.17With the unification ofoptics and electromagnetism, Maxwell’s programme could assign new func-tions to the luminiferous ether: the ether now became the seat of all electricand magnetic activity, most fundamentally the phenomena of the electromag-netic field. After , physicists were using the ether to rethink the wholerange of basic physical concepts, including matter, energy and force.18The Maxwellians and the Heyday of Mechanistic Ether ModelsThe Maxwellian research programme facilitated new and sophisticated modelsof how the ether worked.19Some of the key figures of Maxwellian physics,notably George Francis FitzGerald (–) and Oliver Lodge (–), were dissatisfied with the mathematical austerity that characterised thework of their colleagues on the continent. Calculus and differential equationswere not enough for them; they wanted physical analogies, images, and modelsthat revealed the tangiblemechanismof the ether and the workings of theelectromagnetic field, making it possible to form a clear mental picture.20The result was models presenting the ether variously as a system of spinningcogwheels, or wheels connected by rubber bands.21The French physicist PierreDuhem (–) famously stated that the reader felt like he had entered afactory: ‘In [Lodge’s textbookon electricity]thereare nothing butstringswhichmove around pulleys, which roll around drums, which go through pearl beads,which carry heavy weights; and tubes which pump water while others swell andcontract; toothed wheels which are geared to one another and engage hooks’.2217)For a detailed discussion of Maxwell’s ideas and their implications as explored by hisfollowers, see Hunt,The Maxwellians.18)See Siegel, ‘Thomson, Maxwell, and the Universal Ether in Victorian Physics’; Wise,‘German Concepts of Force, Energy, and the Electromagnetic Ether’; Howard Stein,‘“Subtler forms of Matter” in the Period following Maxwell’.19)Cf. Hunt,The Maxwellians, –.20)Lodge complained about the lack of emphasis on imagery during his entire carreer,advancing it as an argument against the “new physics” of quantum mechanics and relativitytheory in his  exposition,My Philosophy.21)See, e.g., Hunt,The Maxwellians, –, –.22)Duhem’s review of Lodge’sModern Views of Electricity, as citedin Hunt,The Maxwellians,."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –Although Duhem complained that the‘ordered abode of reason’ could beso vulgarly industrialised, it is important to understand the rationale behindthe British physicists’ approach. While Duhem may have seen the English-men’s representations as naïve and clumsy, the English found the mathemat-ical formalism of the French to be cold, unimaginative, and lacking in anyreal explanatory power.23The ether mechanists wanted to go beyond nakedequations and show, by visual and mechanical representations,whyit was thatelectricity behaved the way it did.24At this point we should pause to make the important point that the mech-anistic worldview of the physicists must not be confused with philosophicalmaterialism. Although popular even with some historians, sharp distinctionsbetween th-century “classical” physics and the late modern physics of quan-tum mechanics where the former is portrayed as cold, mechanistic and mate-rialistic, while the latter supposedly has “loosened up” the scientific world-view, is in large part an anachronistic construction which stems in part from asegment of science’s th-century discontents.25In reality, th-century physi-cists, especially in the British Isles, were to a considerable extent opposed to thecrude materialism propagated by hardliners among the “scientific naturalists”.Although there were physicists (notably John Tyndall) among the naturalistswho launched attacks on the authority and validity of religion, largely for thesake of establishing legitimacy for the newly-created scientific profession, theirmainstay was the life sciences.26Overall, the physics community seemed moresympathetic to the strong British tradition of natural theology, as developed23)For this and other conflicts about representations and models in modern science, seeMary Hesse’s classic study,Models and Analogies in Science.24)Hunt,The Maxwellians, –.25)Including New Age science books, like Fritjof Capra’s best-sellingTao of Physics,andhisfollow-up,The Turning Point. These argue that modern science was now coming to (non-deterministic and holistic) conclusions about the ultimate nature of reality that were similarto notions held in Indian religion and philosophy. The strict distinction also seems to bedue to the philosophical and ideological leanings of some of modern physics’ founders,especially in the Copenhagen school of quantum mechanics. For this point, see Forman,‘Weimar Culture, Causality, and Quantum Theory’; idem, ‘Kausalität,Anschaullichkeit,andIndividualität’.

While Cartesian mechanism had posited that the exter-nal world could be accounted for by pondering pieces of extended matterin motion, the Victorian physicists typically concentrated on motion alone.Rather than assuming matter to be a fundamental substance, there was muchdiscussion as to what was the substance which constituted matter itself. Theether mechanists tended to prioritise the all-pervading ether of space; particu-larly, matter could be accounted for by various kinds of motion in the ether.The assumption that Victorian physicists were not only mechanists, but alsomaterialists, is therefore fundamentally flawed.With a philosophical nuance, we could say that they were allphysicalists,butnot necessarily of the materialistic type. While everything isphysical,muchof what is physical is notmaterial.28In fact, many notable Victorian physi-cists also manifested a certain impetus fromidealism.29The most notable con-nection between idealism and ether mechanics is found in the case of Irishphysicist George Johnston Stoney (–), FitzGerald’s uncle. Stoneyguarded against materialism and atheism by grounding his physical theories inan idiosyncratic version of George Berkeley’s subjective idealism. The positionwas taken up by his nephew FitzGerald.30Their argument for linking ideal-ism and mechanics starts with a consideration of motion. As mentioned, theclassical mechanics of DescartesandNewtonhadbeenbasedontwobasicprin-27)E.g., Paley,Natural Theology.28)In modern physics, for example, gravity is a physical effect, but it is not material.Instead it is a geometrical property of the curvature of spacetime. Spacetime certainlyincludes matter, but is not itself material. Similarly, the ether had physical properties (e.g.mechanical agency, in some models elasticity), which ultimately “caused” matter. Notethat physicalism has been defined in many ways in modern philosophy, e.g. the idea that“everything supervenes on the physical”, or the principle of “causal closure”. The latterprinciple, which implies that every event has aphysical cause, is almost indistinguishablefrom the mechanistic philosophy which most Victorian physicists held very dearly. Fora philosophical overview and discussion of what physicalism may imply, including whatdistinguishes it from materialism, see Stoljar, ‘Physicalism’.29)Hunt,The Maxwellians, –; cf.

In Stoney’s mechanistic account, however,only motion is fundamental; it is stated that ultimately, all phenomena, fromelectromagneticand optical phenomenato the material objects themselves,canbe accounted for by variances in motion. This leaves one tricky question: whatis really moving? At this point, Stoney and FitzGerald appealed to thought andconsciousness. According to the two physicists, the only place we can even fig-ure out the ‘inner aspect of motion’ is ‘in our brains’.31Furthermore, in ourconsciousness it is clear that thought is the internal aspect of motion. ‘Can weresist the conclusion that all motion is thought?’, FitzGerald asked.32In otherwords, could it be that the phenomenal world is produced by motions in thegreat universal “Mind of God”? Or, as FitzGerald put it, ‘that all Nature is thelanguage of One in whom we live, and move, and have our being’?33This idealistic background encouraged looking for models where matteritself was explained by the motion of something more fundamental. Stoneyfound the most primary physical phenomenon to be the ‘elemental ether’,which he considered to be ‘space itself regarded as movable’.34In other words,space was seen differently from both the empty void of the atomists and theaprioricategory of Kant, considered rather as a kind of liquid plenum: theether.35Even besides Stoney and FitzGerald’s idealist projects, a promising aspect ofether mechanics was its prospect of developing a “unified field theory” encom-passing matter, electromagnetism, and light, which could replace the idea ofmaterial atoms clashing like billiard balls in a void.36Models attempting toexplain matter as essentially an epiphenomenon of ether go back to the s,when William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) enunciated his vortex theory ofthe atom.37Kelvin’s “vortex theory of matter” sparked a current of theorisingamong physicists, spawning several related models, including by FitzGeraldand Lodge, picturing atoms as vortices with rotational force in a subtle fluid31)FitzGerald quoted in Hunt,The Maxwellians, .32)Ibid.33)Ibid., .34)Stoney quoted in Hunt,The Maxwellians, .35)For a tidy (philosophical) introduction to the changing philosophical and scientificnotions on space and time, see Kennedy,Time, Space, and Einstein.36)E.g., B.G.

The phenomena of electricity, magnetism and thermodynamics (Kelvin’smain field)wouldarise mechanicallyfrom the strain produced by suchvortices,allexpressiblethrough establishedhydrodynamic models. Theponderablemat-ter of the visible universe arose from the arrangement and play of singularitiesin the non-material, non-visible ether. Lodge later held Kelvin’s vortex modelto be such a ‘highly beautiful’ theory that ‘one may almost dare to say that itdeserves to be true’.38The vortex model of matter was highly influential on Lodge and theMawellians, including FitzGerald and Oliver Heaviside, but also on otherprominent physicists who touched on the question of the nature of matter.One examples is (the young) J.J. Thomson, who promoted something akin toa theory of everything based on dynamic fluctuations in the ether in his cele-brated  Adams prize essay. Later attempts in the same vein are found inthe work of William Hicks, not to mention the curious “ether squirt” theoryof Karl Pearson.39The latter postulated that atoms were singularities in theether similar to those proposed by Kelvin, but added that they squirted newether, continuously flowing in all directions of space. Interestingly, in lightof more recent cosmology, Pearson’s theory balanced out the squirting pointswith “ether sinks”, a kind of negative matter which eliminated ordinary mat-ter.40The highly successful research programme of the Maxwellians engagedyounger scientists to venture into new and uncharted territories at the turnof the century. The invention and discovery of the electron, a term introducedby Stoney in , and used by Joseph Larmor (–) in his attempts todevelopyet anotheralternativeethermodelin ,41suggestednewdirectionsfor electromagnetictheory and particle physics. During the sa remarkablearray of strange discoveries were claimed; some of them, like x-rays, radioactiv-ity, and electrons would become accepted parts of physics, while effects suchas N-rays and “black light” would turn out to be premature or spurious.4238)Lodge quoted in Hunt,The Maxwellians, .39)For a brief overview and discussion of all these theories, see Helge Kragh,QuantumGenerations,–.40)The notion of matter and antimatter in contemporary physics is to a point analo-gous; however, whereas matter and antimatter are asymmetrically distributed in our uni-verse, according to present cosmology, Pearson’s “ether sinks” were thought to keep thebalance.41)Hunt,The Maxwellians, –; Kragh,Quantum Generations, –.42)Kragh,Quantum Generations, ; cf.

Lorentz.44The ensuing quest for understanding the struc-ture of atoms and elementary particles, undertaken by people like Thomson,Lorentz, Max Planck, Einstein, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, WernerHeisen-berg, Wolfgang Pauli, and many others, sent physics straight into its “modern”phase.45Eventually, these lines of inquiry would lead to the downfall of ethertheory as well as the continental electromagnetic worldview. Nevertheless, theether was a resilient idea which, despite the common notion that Einstein’s spe-cial relativity exorcised it as early as , survived the emergence of “modernphysics” for several decades.46. The Esoteric Edge of Ether Physics: Occultism, Spiritualism, PsychicalResearchSo far we have seen that the th-century physicists were not afraid of makinghypotheses and conjectures concerning imponderables. We have also seen that,despite its reputation, “materialistic” is precisely what th-century physicswas not. Instead of taking matter to be the fundamental stuff that the worldis made of, physicists were driven by an attempt to find out what matter itselfreally was. In their search for the ultimate physical entities of matter—or whatthe chemist-physicist Sir William Crookes (–) termed “protyles”—physicists were led to theorise that matter might be but an epiphenomenon ofetheric motion, the more fanciful even allowing for the possibility that suchmotion consists of thoughts in the mind of God. In short, physicists readily43)For some examples, see, e.g., Lodge,Modern Views on Matter;Fournierd’Albe,TheElectron Theory; cf. McCormmach, ‘H.A. Lorentz and the Electromagnetic View of Nature’.44)McCormmach, ‘H.A. Lorentz and the Electromagnetic View of Nature’.45)For a good overview of the scientific development, see Kragh,Quantum Generations,–.46)Especially in the British Isles and in the US. An indispensible overview of the regionaldifferences in the reception of special relativity and the status of ether theory is available inStanley Goldberg, ‘In Defense of Ether’. Oliver Lodge, perhaps the most ardent supporterof ether theory, defended a complex system of ether physics which intruded into the realmsof philosophy and theology, as late as . See Lodge,My Philosophy—a book which onescholar described as ‘a Victorian work in the midst of the twentieth century’ (see DavidB. Wilson, ‘The Thought of Late Victorian Physicists’, )."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –lent the ether to philosophical and theological speculation, providing a basisfor a continuation of the British tradition of natural theology in physics.47In another vein, the controversialUnseen Universe, published anonymouslyin  by physicists Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Taite, used the etherto defend the existence of vast realms beyond this world, sustaining Christiannotions of deity, the spiritual body, and an afterlife, even attempting to makesupernaturalism consistent with thermodynamics. Such ideas were stretchedfurther by the leading Maxwellian theoriser Oliver Lodge, who would laterdescribe the ether as ‘the living garment of God’.48The idea of an all-pervading, universal, invisible substance, linking all theuniverse, soon became a powerful conceptual resource for esoteric thinkers.In the following I give a (necessarily brief) summary of the introduction andimportance of the ether in occultism, spiritualism and psychical research in thesecond half of the th century, and indicate the connections with the physicsof the day.The Ether in OccultismThe Theosophical Society (founded ) was one of the most importantlaboratories for refining the ether to suit esoteric purposes. H.P. Blavatsky(–) dwelled extensively on the theme inIsis Unveiled(), whichcarried a critique and synthesis of science and religion. Chapter five of thebook bears the title ‘The Ether, or “Astral Light”’. The term astral light hadbeen introduced by Eliphas Lévi in his seminalDogme et rituel de la hautemagie(), where it signified the subtle “magical agent” permeating nature,whichthemagicianandthemesmeristtappedintoanddirectedthroughexertions of will. Blavatsky’s overall argument was to indicate that this magicalagent, which became fundamental to th-century occultism both in Franceand abroad, was really a form of etheric force. In the process of makingthis point, the chapter demonstrates the syncretistic, synonymising tendencyof theosophical speculation, e.g., in the search for, andde facto creation of,concordances between disparate religious, esoteric, and scientific knowledgesystems.4947)See, e.g., Cantor, ‘The Theological Significance of Ethers’; cf. Noakes, ‘Ethers, Religionand Politics in Late-Victorian Physics’.48)Lodge,Ether & Reality, .49)Cf. Asprem, ‘Kabbalah Recreata’."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –The chapter starts by stating that ‘[t]here has been an infinite confusionof names to express one and the same thing’.50The chaos of the ancients, theZoroastrian fire, thepentecostal fire-tongues,the akasha of the Hindus, and theAstral Light of Eliphas Levi were all manifestations of one and the same thing.These esoteric concepts were furthermore brought together with the many newforce phenomena uncovered by contemporary physics: Blavatsky could citeFaraday, Edison, Graham Bell, Crookes, and even Tyndall as witnessesfor otheretheric effects like magnetism, electricity, telegraphy and telephony. In light ofsuch discoveries and innovations, Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s fictionalvrilforce,described inThe Coming Race(), was also mentioned as something notaltogetherunfeasible.Furthermore,Crookes, himself dedicatedto spiritualism,and a pioneerof theBritish psychical researchtradition, had recentlypostulateda “psychic force” to account for the physical phenomena of spiritualist mediumDaniel Dunglas Home.51These may in turn have been influencedby the occultforces posited by mesmerists and post-mesmerists, from animal magnetism tothe “od force” of industrial chemist Karl von Reichenbach.52Blavatsky’s base argument was that perennial esoteric philosophy had alwaysknown what science was just now beginning to discover:Ether, with all its mysterious and occult properties, containing in itself the germs ofuniversal creation; Ether, the celestial virgin, the spiritual mother of every existing formand being, from whose bosom as soon as “incubated” by the Divine Spirit, are calledinto existence Matter and Life, Force and Action. Electricity, magnetism, heat, light,and chemical action are so little understood even now that fresh facts are constantlywidening the range of our knowledge. Who knows where ends the power of thisprotean giant—Ether; or whence its mysterious origin?—Who, we mean, that deniesthespiritthatworksinitandevolvesoutofitallvisibleforms?53Bringing together Indian thought, Lévi’s idea of magical agency, and the sci-ence of ether, she could triumphantly state that ‘Akasa is the mysterious fluidtermed by scholastic science, “the all-pervading ether”; it enters into all themagical operations of nature, and produces mesmeric, magnetic, and spiritual50)Blavatsky,Isis Unveiled, Vol. , .51)See Crookes,Researches into the Phenomena of Spiritualism.52)See von Reichenbach,Odisch-magnetische Briefe; cf.

Furthermore, it is brought into concordance with a wide range ofdisparate knowledge systems, presenting it as the core subject of an allegedperennial philosophy.55While her synthesis is obviously speculative and, in all its expansionistvigour, questionable from the scientific point of view, it is nevertheless worthpointing out that Blavatsky’s use of scientific references does not amount tosimple cherry-picking. Even if the fictionalvrilforce and Crookes’ psychicforce were marginal, they existed within a realm of speculation where thepossibility of discovering such exotic effects remained at least plausible inprinciple. The subsequent discoveries of x-rays and nuclear radiation suggestthis very point.56In general, the effects and speculations Blavatsky referred towere at the heart of mainstream physics, and indeed she could have found evenstronger corroborative statementshad she beenaware of the thoroughly idealistposition of someone like Stoney or FitzGerald.As I shall show in more detail in part three, Blavatsky’s successors would takethe alignment of Theosophy and ether physics even further in the s. Thesuccess of Maxwellian electromagnetic theory, the breakthrough in discoveriesof yet new wave and ray phenomena, and continued speculations about theultimate nature of matter provided post-Blavatskyan Theosophists like AnnieBesant and Charles Webster Leadbeater with important resources for updatingthe metaphors, models and analogies of Theosophy. These developments leadstraight up to the “atomic metaphysics” noted by Hammer.Spiritualism and Psychical ResearchSpiritualism and psychical research also benefited from a close connection withVictorian physics. Spiritualists had attempted to claim scientific validationfor their belief-system more or less from the first rap in the s. Broadlyspeaking, however, the legitimation they had sought in science was not so54)Blavatsky,Isis Unveiled,Vol.,(footnote).55)Cf. Faivre,Access to Western Esotericism, .

Nye, ‘N-Rays’."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –much theoretical and conceptual as experimental and empirical.57Relying onassumptions loaned from positivistic empiricism, the whole range of séancephenomena (including rappings, trance-utterances, levitations and the sort)were claimed as simple verifications of the hypothesis that our personalitysurvives this life and that there is constant interaction between this worldand the next. With psychical research the interaction with the sciences, andparticularly physics, became more profound. The historian of science RichardNoakes goes so far as to suggest that psychical research may be considered ‘anepisode in late-classical physics’ in its own right.58With the rise of organised psychical research, physicists themselves didmuch to enhance the scientific legitimacy of at least some of the claims sur-rounding spiritualism. William Crookes was an early example, applying pres-sure gauges to D.D. Home in  to measure the exact amount of “psychicforce” expended by his body during the séance.59When the Society for Psy-chical Research (SPR) formed in , it was with an impressive number ofprestigious physicists on board: William Barrett and Oliver Lodge assumedimportant functions in the Society, and later Nobel laureates J.J. Thomson andLord Rayleigh were listed as members. Even though the latter two were largelysceptical of the claimed phenomena, their names provided the membership listof the Society with extra scientific prestige.While psychical researchers were largely prepared to take spiritualism seri-ously from a scientific point of view, this does not mean that they were will-ing to certify the truth of whatever spiritualists claimed. Especially during theearly decades of the SPR, the explanatory models proposed by physicists andother theorisers in the Society were at odds with those of the spiritualists’ own.While spiritualists were eager to demonstrate the survival of the soul, psychicalresearchers largely concentrated on various forms of extra-sensory perception(telepathy and clairvoyance in particular), and advanced these as alternativemodels for explaining the apparently privileged information uttered by medi-ums in “trance”.60Lodge, an expert of electromagnetism and ether physics, anda pioneer of radio technology, played a leading role in enunciating telepathy as57)Note, however, the use ofanalogiesto concepts popularised from science. E.g., Oppen-heim,The Other World; Noakes, ‘Spiritualism, Science, and the Supernatural in Mid-Victorian Britain’.58)Noakes, ‘The “World of the Infinitely Little”’, .59)Crookes,Researches into the Phenomena of Spiritualism; cf. Medhurst, ed.,Crookes andthe Spirit World.60)The classic example of this sort of explanation is in Gurney et al,Phantoms of the Living."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –a form of anomalous cognition supervening on a mechanical physical founda-tion. He offered a suggestive analogy in response to telepathy tests reported inthe SPR journal of :Just as the energy of an electric charge, though apparently on the conductor, is not onthe conductor, but in all the space round it; just as the energy of an electric current,though apparently in the copper wire, is certainly not all in the copper wire, andpossibly not any of it; so it may be that the sensory consciousness of a person, thoughapparently located in the brain, may be conceived of as also existing like a faint echoin space, or in other brains, though these are ordinarily too busy and pre-occupied tonotice it.61This is essentially an application of Maxwellian field theory to telepathy. Lodgethought mind-to-mind communication to be possible in principle, appar-ently viewing “consciousness” as a function of the electromagnetic field, withthoughts identified with waves in the ether—‘faint echoes in space’. The pan-psychist implications of this thesis were not worked out, however.This line of theorisation became increasingly popular in the s ands, borrowing from the persuasiveness of new technologies of radio wavetransmissions and wireless telegraphy. Although it did suggest that mediumswere extraordinarily gifted “super-psychics”, and that there could be spon-taneous entanglements of two minds at a distance (as with the apparitionof dying loved ones), the telepathic theory could not by itself validate post-mortem survival. Interestingly, this started to change at the beginning of theth century. The reasons were twofold: on the one hand, the demise of thesceptically-minded leader of the SPR, Henry Sidgwick, and others of his gen-eration who had become increasingly disenchanted with fraudulent mediums;on the other hand, an experimental anomaly in the mechanistic models oftelepathy brought the survival hypothesis into the game again. On top ofthis, of course, one should mention the pivotal importance of the Great War,which brought a general revival of spiritualism lasting well into the s andbeyond.62The experimental anomaly was that the mechanical electromagnetic theoryof telepathy required the effect to obey the inverse square law, as any otherphysical effect: for example, if telepathy supervened on mechanical principles,one would expect it to diminish with distance. This, however, did not seem to61)Lodge , ‘Experiments in Thought Transference’, .62)E.g., Jenny Hazelgrove,Spiritualism and British Society between the Wars."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –obtain. At the dawn of thenewcentury,therefore,thefailure of themechanistictheory of telepathy prompted individuals like Lodge, acting then as presidentof the SPR (between –), to reconsider the thesis of survival. But hewould still insist on staying within the realm of physics. The contours of anastonishing theory were expressed in Lodge’s presidential address to the SPR in. Here he suggested that the extraordinary features of the medium mightbe due to the possession and control of an “ether body”, and even speculatedthat completely discorporate, etherial beings might exist in multitudes, parallelto our ordinary visible existence.This model would be a great step in the direction of validating the spiritu-alist hypothesis: spirit manifestationsduring séances, even spirit photographs,might be due to partial “materialisations” of the etheric bodies of deceasedpersons. Nevertheless, Lodge remained quite open about the origin of ethericbeings; they could equally well be discarnate, “extraspacial” beings, or evenextraterrestrials from far off inhabited planets!63At any rate, both Lodge andthe physicist who succeeded him as the SPR’s president, William Barrett,seemed to agree that the brain-wave model had failed, that mediumistic phe-nomena were likely to be purely ‘spiritual and psychical events’,64and thatthought possibly ‘transcends both matter and space, and has no relation toeither’.65In the decades to come, Lodge assumed the role of triune prophet ofspiritualism, liberal Christianity, and ether physics.66The concept of the etherbody would play an increasingly central part in the campaign: in this concept,all three discourses were knitted together, as a knot of threads that most wouldhave preferred to keep apart. Here, ether physics finally forms a completecircle with esoteric thought. Where the imponderables of physics had providedconundrums fit for esoteric speculation, the physicist Lodge now adoptedwhat was essentially an esoteric concept vested with scientific language, andattempted to claim it back on behalf of an increasingly metaphysical etherphysics.63)Lodge, ‘Presidential Address’, .64)Lodge, ‘Presidential Address ()’, .65)Barrett, ‘Presidential Address ()’, .66)See, e.g., Jolly,Sir Oliver Lodge;cf.Bowler,Reconciling Science and Religion, –."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –. Etheric Bodies: Self, Soul, and Cognition in the Mirror of Esoteric EtherPhysicsEsotericism and the Metaphysics of Ether: Some DistinctionsTheories of ether have served as a connecting point between physical and psy-chical science on the one hand, and various modern esoteric systems on theother. With the background firmly in mind, we should now briefly revisit the“atomic metaphysics” which Hammer observed in the writings of Alice Baileyin the s. Following the argument of this article, I suggest that Bailey isreally writing within a current of esotericether metaphysics,adiscoursewhichhas deep roots in th-century Theosophy and its relation to spiritualism,physics and psychical research. As will be shown more clearly in this chapter,the main spokespersons of the Theosophical segmentof this discourse were sec-ond generation Theosophists, particularly Annie Besant and Charles W. Lead-beater. Broadly considered, however, ether metaphysics stretches much fur-ther,and encompasses non-Theosophists, including (as suggestedalready) non-esoteric spokespersons in the physics community, adherents of natural theol-ogy and promulgators of liberal Christianity writing on the conflict betweenreligion and science.67In the present chapter I shall particularly look at theesoteric metaphysics of ether as found in second generation Theosophy, and inthe physics-oriented segment of psychical research.Just as ether was made to perform a vast range of tasks in th-centurythought, the esoteric metaphysics of ether also has different facets. We maybroadly differentiate between acosmologicaland ananthropologicalstrand. Inthe cosmological sense, esoteric spokespersons depart from the physical spec-ulations of the relation between ether, matter, and energy in order to arguean esoteric worldview, typically amounting to some sort of idealism, panpsy-chism or vitalism. The ether may be seen as the world soul, the mind of God,or an impersonal, all-permeating life force. Cosmological ether metaphysicsconnects to questions asked in physics, chemistry, and (occasionally) biology,as well as to other esoteric systems, as is clearly the case in Blavatsky. I sug-gest it was this cosmological side of ether metaphysics that Hammer observedin Bailey’s speculations on the ultimate nature of atoms, describing them asin some sense “etherial”, as was a common notion among late-Victorian etherphysicists.67)See, e.g., Bowler,Reconciling Science and Religion, –."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –Considerations of the role of ether in the cosmos almost inevitably led toa consideration of the role of ether in the constitution of man. It may startfrom questions of psychology or biology, but will often end up encompassingquestions of a more philosophical, religious or esoteric form, pondering man’shidden nature, faculties, and subtle bodies. The concept of the “ether body” isthus the centrepiece of the anthropological side of esoteric ether metaphysics,and is heavily informed by long-standing esoteric, religious and philosophicaldiscourses on subtle bodies. I shall suggest that we may distinguish thesespeculations into three main areas, considering questions of the soul, the self,and cognition.As we have already seen, the ether body has performed an important func-tion for spiritualists and psychical researchers in shedding light on the age-oldquestion of the existence and nature of the human soul and its (im)mortality.The perhaps most sophisticated and consistent example of this type, connect-ing theetherof physics to thesoul, is found in the lateoeuvreof Oliver Lodge.68But discourses of subtle bodies, including those of the etheric type, may alsohave ramifications for conceptions of the self, and particularly its extensionand boundaries. Thus the doctrines of subtle selves suggest that human exis-tence extends in a continuum from the gross and physical to the increasinglymore subtle,and even divine. This continuous existencefurthermoreasks ques-tions of subjectivity and intersubjectivity, as well as of humanity’s connectionto the cosmos at large.69Finally, the discourse on subtle bodies has reper-cussions in the fields of cognition and epistemology. Here we find connec-tions with all the typical denominators of models of esotericism, e.g., esotericclaims to higher knowledge, forms of thought, intuitive gnosis, mediation, etc.In the period we are looking at here, we should mention such claimed fac-ulties as clairvoyance, astral travel, and telepathy. In the jargon of psychicalresearch, subtle bodies will have a bearing on various types of “anomalous cog-nition”.68)E.g., Lodge, ‘Ether, Matter, and the Soul’; idem,My Philosophy; cf. Grean Raia, ‘FromEther Theory to Ether Theology’. Note, however, that history had at this point run awayfrom Lodge in many ways; his increasingly speculative and expansive use of ether physicswere uttered at a time in which new generations of physicists were concentrating on newcosmological models, based on the relativity theories and quantum mechanics.69)Similar topics were recently explored in Jay Johnston,Angels of Desire, but throughthe conceptual machinery of Irigaray, Deleuze, and Derrida.

During this final section we shall see that all the above three areasenter into the discourse on the subtle ether body.Occultism and Subtle BodiesWhen Eliphas Lévi set forth the doctrines and rituals of “high magic” andsparked the modern occultist reception of ritual magic in the middle of theth century, it came with a full theory of the “sidereal body” and its manyfunctions. The basic theory tallies for the most part with the Neoplatonictripartition, known from Proclus, Iamblichus, Plotinus, Porphyry and others,where the subtle body—whether called “astral”, “ethereal”, or “sidereal”—isprimarily the envelope of the divine soul, oraugoeides.70In this position it isresponsible for mediating the animating powers of the soul to the organs of thebody.71This idea seems to have reached Lévi through the “occult sciences” ofthe Renaissance; he particularly references to Paracelsus as a proponent of themodel.72Similar to some (but not all) of the Neoplatonic models, Lévi’s astralbody was a perishable entity: it was forged when the soul entered this world,but would be cast away on reascending to the heavenly abodes.73But theastral body also causedsuchvaried phenomenaashauntings,polyap-pearances, werewolves, and the apparitions conjured up by necromancy. It wasconnected with apparitions of the dead because of its semi-materiality. Léviexplains that the astral body evaporates instantly after death if a man has liveda virtuous life; but if he has lived in sin, the astral body will continue to betied to his passions and desires, and continually “haunt” the objects of unful-70)See E.R. Dodds, ‘The Astral Body in Neoplatonism’.71)Lévi,Transcendental Magic, .72)Ibid., . For an accessible discussion of the concepts of “body” and “matter” in Paracel-sus, see Dane T. Daniel, ‘Invisible Wombs’.73)Lévi,Transcendental Magic, . Dodds notes that there were two parallel theories ofthe astral body in Neoplatonism: one in whichit was permanently attached to the soul (theopinion of Iamblichus and others), and another where it was thought to be acquired duringthe descent of the soul to earthly existence (due to attraction of moisture and matter), anddiscarded at its ascent. The latter modelwas held by Plotinus, Porphyry, and theChaldeanOracles, and it is this that we see replicated in occultism through Lévi’s interpretation. SeeDodds, ‘The Astral Body in Neoplatonism’, –. It is also to be noted that Doddshimself spends some time in the opening of his article to combat the theosophical doctrineof subtle bodies."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –filled desire: ‘It torments the dreams of young girls, bathes in the stream of spiltblood and floats about the places where the pleasures of its life elapsed’.74Thedivine soul is trapped and tormented in the astral body, sometimes for decadesor centuries, until it finally dies a second time. Furthermore, Lévi explainsthe polyappearance stories connected to Alphonse Ligouri (–) andFrancis Xavier (–) in terms of the projection and apparition of theastral body during ecstatic prayer.75Similarly, werewolves,whose existenceLéviconsidered well documented, were caused by the unrestrained dwelling of theastral body during sleep, undergoing transmutations into animal forms madepossible by the creative powers of the “magical agent” which Lévi termed the“Astral Light”.76Lévi also produces explanations of mesmerism with referenceto the controlled exertion of Astral Light through the astral body, thus inscrib-ing himself in the post-Enlightenment discourse on subtle and occult forcesoperating from “the night side of nature”.77Lévi’s work was immensely influential on later developments in occultism,both on the continent and in Britain.78This goes for the ritual magical current,represented by such groups as the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor and theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as for the theosophical currentsparked by Blavatsky and Olcott’s Theosophical Society. Meanwhile, fictionalaccounts of astral travel fuelled an ever richer and accessible mythology ofsubtle bodies: Edward Bulwer-Lytton’sAStrangeStory() and EmmaHardinge Britten’sGhost LandandArt Magic(both ) were particularlyinfluential examples.79The Theosophical Society presented ‘a mission to correct the misapprehen-sions of spiritualism, to expand the horizons of science, and to oppose dog-matic Christianity’.80All this it wanted to achieve by providing a forum forstudying Hermeticism and Western esoteric doctrines, but also by promotingBlavatsky’s position on occultism, posed as a challenge to, and reinterpretationof, spiritualism.81In this latter project, Lévi’s ideas on the astral body became74)Lévi,Transcendental Magic, .75)Ibid., –.76)Ibid., –.77)Ibid., –.78)E.g., McIntosh,Eliphas Lévi and the French Occult Revival.79)For the importance of fiction in the development of occultism, see especially Faivre,‘Borrowings and Misreadings’.

With thismove, the concept of subtle bodies likewise expanded in various new direc-tions.The first clear example is found in an  article inThe Theosophist,writ-ten by A.O. Hume (–).83Purportedly based on esoteric knowledgeimparted by Blavatsky’s “spiritual master”, Koot Hoomi, the article proposeda sevenfold structure for human subtle bodies.84This skeletal form was elabo-rated further by Alfred Sinnett (–) a few years later, in his tellinglyentitled bookEsoteric Buddhism(). The book argued that the key to theuniversal, esoteric doctrine underlying all exoteric religion is most accessiblethrough the author’s detraditionalised conception of Buddhism. A practicalresult is the incorporation of Sanskrit terminology and reinterpretation of pre-vious doctrines in light of the models found in Buddhist cosmologies andanthropologies. Thus, through sections on ‘The Constitution of Man’ and ‘TheAstral Shell’ we learn more about how human beings possess seven bodies,instead of the Neoplatonic three.85The physical body has two parts: therupa,or ordinary material body, and thepranaorjivabody, which is the vital bodymediating vital force to living things. These are joined by more subtle bod-ies: the astral (linga sharira),kama,manas,andbuddhibodies, crowned by theatma,orpurespirit.86This sevenfold reorientation became the esoteric cur-rency of Theosophical discourse on subtle bodies, as canonised in Blavatsky’s magnum opus,The Secret Doctrine.8782)Blavatsky,Isis Unnveiled, Vol. I, –.83)Hume, ‘Fragments of Occult Truth’.84)For an analysis of the development of the so-calledSaptaparña, see Julie Hall, ‘TheSaptaparña: The Meaning and Origins of the Theosophical Septenary Constitution of Man’.85)Sinnett,Esoteric Buddhism, –.86)All these terms are capitalised in the original, but have been simplified in the presentnotation.87)For a detailed discussion, see Hall, ‘The Saptaparña’."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –It was only in the neo-Theosophical phase after Blavatsky’s demise thata conceptual shift would fully take place, which aligned the theosophicaldoctrine of subtle bodies more firmly with ether physics and science. After theschisms of the mid s between the “original” Adyar society, led by Olcottuntil his death in , and the American faction headed by William Q. Judge,Annie Besant emerged as a key figure in the development of Theosophicaldoctrine. She would eventually succeed Olcott as president of the society; butin the meanwhile, Besant served as chief editor of the Theosophical journalLucifer, with G.R.S. Mead as co-editor from .From this influential position Besant assumed centre stage in what is some-times termed the “Neo-Theosophy” of the Adyar society.88As editor ofLucifershe started a publication campaign that updated the strategic alignment ofTheosophy with modern science. Through her column “On the Watch-Tower”Besant discussed recent events and debates, including discoveries and advancesin the world of science, usually cast as confirmations of Theosophical doctrine.Also during the s, Besant teamed up with the self-professed clairvoyantCharles W. Leadbeater, whom she first met in London in , and embarkedupon the curious Theosophical research project known as “occult chemistry”:the attempt to investigate the structure and make-up of molecules, atoms, andether by way of clairvoyant perception.89I shall have more to say about this ina moment.Besant’s readings of an ether physics that was at its peak of respectabilityprompted her to attempt a synonymisation of the Theosophical subtle bodieswith the theories of the subtle substance of ether. Here, too, she was followedby Leadbeater; togetherthey reinvented the Theosophical discourse on the sub-tle body, preparing its cultural diffusion in the process. When Arthur E. Powellwrote a compilation of what had been said about theEtheric Doublein  hecould cite no fewer than  works, the bulk of which were written after the year.90Five of these were by psychical researchers (W.J. Crawford, W.J. Kil-ner, and Baron von Schrenck-Notzing), while the rest were by Theosophicalauthors, particularly Besant and Leadbeater. Their influence in creating thisparticular discourse cannot be underestimated.88)For standard biographies of Besant, see Arthur H.

The programme of occult chemistry, withits theoretical foundations and links to other parts of the theosophical system,constitutes a clear case of the interconnections of the various types of esotericether metaphysics, as described above. In important ways the programme waspresented as a system of knowledge, and a method ofacquiringknowledge,which complemented and fulfilled current physical science. At the same time,the main project remained to continue and update a line of Theosophicalspeculation on higher realities and hidden aspects of man that had alreadybeen initiated by the early society.The project of occult chemistry was first signalled in an article inLuciferinNovember .91The article, written by Besant, embarked by observing quiterightly that physicists were spending much time speculating on the nature ofthe chemical elements and the existence of the ether.92But the physicists couldindeed only speculate; the very existence of the ether was nothing more thanan inference to the best explanation. Their instruments could not detect etherdirectly; in fact, a series of advanced experiments had been performed since thesthathad attemptedtoisolate effectswhich couldsolelybeduetoether,ofwhich the Michelson-Morley experiment of  remains the most famous.93These had met with little success, causing much confusion in the physics com-munity. To theosophists, however, ether was not only a hypothetical impon-derable entity, postulated by reason and wanting in verification; it was a quitereal and evenobservablesubstance. As Besant put it, to ‘astral vision ether is a91)For a recent scholarly examination of Besant and Leadbeater’s occult chemistry, seeMorrisson,Modern Alchemy, –.92)Besant, ‘Occult Chemistry’, .93)The experiment tried to measure variances in the speed of light depending on the relativemotion of bodies in the supposedly stationary ether. It is sometimes described as the mostfamous failed experiment in history, marking the start of the decline of ether physics. OliverLodge was actually responsible for conducting follow-up experiments on his own, tryingto verify another hypothesised etheric effect which would explain away the failure of theMichelson-Morley experiment, namely “ether drag”—that heavy bodies drag some of thesurrounding ether with it. This too failed, however, but would inspire one of the otherstrange concepts later incorporated and sublimated by Einsteinian relativity, namely “lengthcontraction”."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –visible thing, and is seen permeating all substances and encircling every par-ticle’.94What ‘Western’ scientists can only assume by inferences, ‘Eastern sci-ence asserts as a verifiable observation, for as a matter of fact ether is as visibleas a chair or a table, only a sight different from the physical is needed to seeit’.95Science is essentially correct, but it remains speculative. The Theosophi-cal research programme of occult chemistry, on the other hand, sets forth toprovide direct empirical and positive proof of entities invisible to the physicaleye. Here, what I have called thecognitivefeatures of an esoteric anthropologybased on subtle bodies and ether metaphysics become visible. As Mark Morris-son has argued, the epistemological possibility of perceiving an invisible worldaligned occult chemistry with the contemporaneous attempts to make systemsfor visualising atomic level physical processes.96However, it did so by reformu-lating a discourse on supernormal vision and cognitive abilities in the contextof an esoteric anthropology based on ether metaphysics.To begin with, Besant and Leadbeater put their clairvoyant skills to the taskof analysing the chemical structure of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. In thefirst published “pilot study” of  they showed how the three ordinary phys-ical states of matter (solid, liquid and gaseous) were complemented by fourdifferent types of etheric states, named E , E , E , and E , significantly (inthe context of Theosophical number symbolism) adding up to seven.97Theirinvestigations attempted to “split” the molecules of the three elements intotheir constituents on the four “etheric subplanes”, and trace their increasinglycomplex chemical makeup down to the “ultimate physical atom” on the mostsubtle “Ether ” plane. If one continued to split the atom from E , Besantexplained, one was left with a set of yet finer constituents of “astral matter”,now entirely beyond the ordinarily ponderable physical world.98This is cos-mological ether metaphysics, “discovered” by the special cognitive powers of“astral vision”.9994)Besant, ‘Occult Chemistry’,  (my emphasis).95)Besant, ‘Man and His Bodies’, .96)Morrisson,Modern Alchemy, –.97)Besant, ‘Occult Chemistry’, –.98)Besant, ‘Occult Chemistry’, .99)It should be noted that this ether metaphysics only forms a part of the total (neo-)Theo-sophical cosmology. The new details inspired by ether physics mainly concern the interme-diary place between higher and lower worlds in the total Theosophical “chain of being”. Anoverview of the Theosophical scheme of cosmology, which particularly focuses on the roleand position of ether, is available in Powell,The Etheric Double."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –In February , Besant published the first in a series of articles inLuciferon ‘Man and His Bodies’, republished as a book later that year.100This tookup the corresponding anthropology of the ether metaphysical research pro-gramme, namely the exploration and reinterpretation of the subtle bodiespostulated by Theosophy. Broadly speaking, Besant followed the “Oriental”arrangement of her predecessors, by postulating a total of seven bodies. How-ever, she was also prepared to do some conceptual changes and metaphoricalupdates, especially regarding the lower bodies. While the Sanskrit terminologywas largely retained for describing the higher parts of man, the lower ones werefashioned anew by realigning them with occult chemistry and its appropria-tion of ether physics. Besant’s description of these lower bodies deserves closerattention.We already saw Besant and Leadbeater attributing seven states to mat-ter: the three ordinary states recognised by science at the time, with four“etheric” states added. This arrangement is applied to the constitution of manas well. Man has, in fact, two physical bodies: one is a mixture of solids,fluids, and gases, and is called the “gross body”. The other is composed ofthe four states of ether, and is known as the etheric double. Besant explainsthat in the Theosophical literature these two lower bodies of man used to gounder the namessthûla sharîraandlinga sharîra; however, now she arguesthat it is time to stop referring to the double by this latter term. As Besantexplains, the wordlinga sharîrahas been used ‘since time immemorial’ byHindus in a different sense; additionally ‘it is better to have English namesfor the subdivisions of the human constitution, and thus remove from ourelementary literature the stumbling-block to beginners of a Sanskrit terminol-ogy’.101Butapart from issues of respectfulnessto theHindus and accessibility to newstudents, Besant had more profound reasons why a change in terminology wasapt:thenameethericdoubleexactly expresses the nature and constitutionof the subtlerportion of the physical body, and is thus significant and therefore easy to remember, asevery name should be; it is “etheric,” because made of ether, “double” because an exactduplicate of the gross body—its shadow, as it were.102100)Besant,Man and His Bodies.101)Besant, ‘Man and His Bodies’, .102)Besant, ‘Man and His Bodies’, – (my emphasis)."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Egil Asprem / ARIES . () –This paragraph is important because it clarifies that the term “etheric” isnot merely a convention or a metaphor: the double isreallymade of the samestuff that physics talks about. The attempt at synonymy is emphasised whenBesant exhibits a fair command of the reasoning of late Victorian ether physicsto corroborate the existence of the ether body: ‘Modern physical science’ holdsthat all bodily changes in the muscles, cells and nerves are accompanied byelectrical action, she states, before making an appeal to the conception inMaxwellian physics that electrical activity has its seat in the ether. In Besant’swords, ‘[w]henever electric action occurs ether must be present, so that thepresence of the current is proof of the presence of the ether, which interpen-etrates all, surrounds all’.103Therefore, too, it is legitimate to speculate aboutan etheric counterpart to the “gross body” where this vital, electrically chargednerve activity takes place.The main function of the ethericdouble in theneo-Theosophical system washowevertocarryamoreprofoundtypeofenergy:prâna, or the “life force”. Theetheric body is often spoken of as the ‘vehicle of Prâna’, Besant explains.104Theether is thus not only associated with electricity, but also inscribed in avitalistdiscourse.105The connection of the ether body to vitalism makes Besant’s reflections onits role in death unsurprising. She notes that during sleep the “Ego” slips outof both physical bodies and roams around in the realm of the astral (whichis the third body Besant attributes to man, connected with sensation andperception). This happens during death as well, the only difference being thatthe Ego (or the totality of the higher subtle bodies, including that whichbrings consciousness of self) takes the etheric body with it. When the ethericand the gross body are thus separated, the supply of vital effluvia is cut off,and the organism dies.106The ether body here plays a role almost identical toLévi’s astral body: The Ego and the etheric body may travel around for sometime together after death, but will always stay close to the gross body. Thisactivity, Besant entrusts her readers, is responsible for the apparition of thenewlydead tomourningrelatives,or evenfor wandering ‘churchyardghosts’.107103)Besant, ‘Man and His Bodies (continued)’, .104)Besant, ‘Man and His Bodies (continued)’, .105)Oliver Lodge would argue a very similar point a couple of decades later, this time furtherallied with the early th-century neo-vitalist discourse.

Since it is so closely connected with the vital functions of theorganism it is not normally possible for people to separate the etheric from thegross body while alive. But there are some especially gifted persons who canstretch it a bit, so that it may perform functions at a slight distance. This iswhat Besant recognises in some materialisation phenomena, where the ethericbody of the exceptionally gifted medium is extended to produce visible effects.It is made possible by the extended notion of self that comes with the con-cept of subtle bodies; with the physical but non-material etheric counterpart,this takes on a peculiarly concrete form. Extending the etheric body from thematerial in this way remains a dangerous practice, Besant warns, and may leadto nervous trouble, lethargy, and, if strained too much, death.108The ideas connected to the ether body are, as we have seen, far from new.The notion of subtle bodies is an inheritance that has gone through numerouspermutations, and the specific phenomena connected to them seem rathercommonplace in occultism long before Besant’s active days. But the ethericbody as it emerged on the pages ofLuciferin the s did add a scientificcredibility of another order than previous attempts, allying the speculationswith exciting frontline reports from the contemporary physics of ether andelectromagnetism, as well as new physical theories on the nature of matter.In the ether body the various threads of an esoteric anthropology are tiedtogether and brought into alignment with the most speculative branch oflate-classical physics. Etheric existence is brought to bear on the spiritualistquestion of survival, but it also implies an extension of the self: spatially andsemi-materially, as in the case of the explanation of the physical mediums, butalso epistemologically or cognitively. Besant and Leadbeater’s occult chemistryrested on an epistemological foundation built on “micro-clairvoyance”, orthe direct perception of sub-microscopic entities. Through a conspicuouslyrecursive logic, this very faculty is explained by reference to the ether, while itis alsothroughthis faculty that ether itself is, supposedly, directly observed.109108)Besant, ‘Man and His Bodies (continued)’, –.109)It is notable that the programme of occult chemistry never really died out.

As this article has aimedto demonstrate, the late nineteenth-century physics of ether provided invalu-able resources for esoteric spokespersons. The physicists themselves, despite alater reputation of having been staunch materialists, were in reality producinga number of different theories which sought to reduce matter to other, moresubtle substances or processes, sometimes even offering these models as partsof an idealistic cosmology. Viewed in this light, the metaphysical ambitionsof theosophists and other occultists seem less alien, less heterodox, and theirappeal to educated men and women, including professional scientists, moreeasily understandable.BibliographyAsprem, Egil, ‘Kabbalah Recreata: Reception and Adaptation of Kabbalah in ModernOccultism’,The Pomegranate International Journal for Pagan Studies: (), –.———, ‘Magic Naturalized?
