Nelle intenzioni di Lullo, tale Arte doveva servirecome evangelo esoterico per Christiani, Ebrei e Musulmani attraverso l’istituzione di unaforma di conoscenza assoluta e indipendente dall’autorità dottrinale. La forma esotericadi evangelismo cristiano elaborata da Lulla traeva ispirazione da varie fonti del Neoplato-nismo cristiano, del Sufismo, della filosofia musulmana e forse della Kabbalah presenti nellaSpagna del tardo XIII secolo. Il pensiero lulliano, nutritosi in questo modo di una varietàdi tradizioni, offre un perfetto esempio medievale do come diverse correnti dell’esoterismooccidentale potessero trovare un’armonizzazione e una concordanza. La sua condordanzapuntava fungesse da strumento missionario per la conversione al Cristianesimo di Musul-mani e Mongoli, in un’epoca di grave instabilità globale. L’Arte lulliana esemplifica esote-rismo occidentale in fuzione di una specifica finalità politica, che investiva evangelismo eimpegno militante.

Lull’s esotericform of Christian evangelism drew on varied sources of Christian Neopla-tonism, Sufism, Moslem philosophy, and possibly Kabbalah in late twelfth-century Spain. Thus resourced by multiple traditions, Lull’s thought offers afine medieval example of how different currents of Western esotericism couldbe harmonized and brought into concordance, thereby anticipating a classicfeature of Renaissance esoteric philosophy.3Western esotericism has been characterised as the combination of Alexan-drian Hermeticism, Neoplatonism and related religious philosophies of lateantiquity and the traces each has left in the three Abrahamic religions. Thiscombination of legacies was intrinsic to Ramon Lull’s late medieval project forinter-faith dialogue. His concordance was intended to produce a logical andmetaphysical system to act as a missionary instrument for the conversion ofthe Moslems and the Mongols to Christianity at a time of acute global insta-bility in the late thirteenth century. In this sense, Lull’s Art exemplifies theform and content of Western esotericism in relation to an explicit politicalpurpose, involving evangelism and a frontline battle for hearts and minds. Theeclecticism and coherence of Lull’s concordance also help explain the durabil-2)The standard modern work in English on Lull is Hillgarth,Ramon Lull and Lullismin Fourteenth-Century France.

Lull’s esotericconcordance, his mission to the Moslems, and his vision of a new global orderare highly prescient in the present context of resurgent Islam.Geopolitical Survey from  to The Eurasian world of Ramon Lull in the thirteenth century was essentially athreefold international order, involving Christendom, Islam and the Mongols.Global security and international peace was one of Lull’s objects in his questfor a unifying, absolute knowledge, so it is helpful to review the balance ofpowers, their origins and prospects in his own era.Christianity was the dominant religion and culture of Western and EasternEurope. Christendom had been first divided by the differing fates of the EasternRoman Empire (Byzantium) and the barbarian invasions and destruction ofthe Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. Cut off from Byzantium, thesuccessor Germanic kingdoms had made their own way as early Christian statesuntil Charlemagne (–), king of the Franks, was crowned emperor ofa new Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III in . This created a parallelimperial jurisdiction and the rift between the emperors and popes in Romeand Byzantium grew wider until the great schism of  between the LatinWest and the Orthodox churches of the Greek East. Islam prevailed across thesouthern and eastern Mediterranean territories embracing the Asia Minor, theLevant, Syria, Egypt, North Africa and Andalusia.Whereas Christianity was the religious and political legacy of Hellenism andthe Roman Empire since the late fourth century in Europe and the Near East,Islam was a relatively more recent force. The seventh century had witnessedthe rapid expansion of Islam as a militant religion of the Arab tribes underthe first four caliphs (–) into the Sassanid empire of Mesopotamia andPersia in the East and across Africa. After crossing the Straits of Gibraltar in, Moslem armies invaded Spain in the West with further conquests underthe Ommayad caliphs (–), until they were checked by Charles Martel,king of the Franks, at Tours in .

However, the Christianreconquistafrom the ele-venth century onwards led to the establishment of the Catholic kingdoms ofLeon, Castille, Navarre and the Crown of Aragon in the northern part of theIberian peninsula, while the fissile nature of Islamic sovereignty led to the disin-tegration of the Ommayad caliphate. Its small states were then overwhelmed bythe Almorávides and Almohádes Moors from northwestern Africa from onwards. The Almorávides (–) and Almohádes (–) empiresperpetuated Moslem rule and culture across southern and central Spain wellinto the mid-thirteenth century, by which time a further retreat of Islam wasevident. Thereconquistacontinued with further enormous Christian gains tothe kingdom of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, the kingdoms of Valenciaand Majorca up to .Meanwhile, Moslem power in the East had been strengthened by the arrivalof the Seljuks, a Turkic people from the northern steppes converted to Islam,who became protectors of the Abbasid caliphate in , destroyed a Byzantinearmy in  and advanced into Anatolia and Syria. The Seljuks waged a warof conversion and threatened access to Christian pilgrims, thus provoking theFirst Crusade. However, their empire stretching from their capital Konia toCentral Asia, from Armenia to the Persian Gulf restored Islamic unity andrevived its arts and commerce. However, within two centuries Islam suffereda massive onslaught from the Mongols, whose hordes had first swept acrossAsia from Karakorum in – under their first chieftain Genghis Khan(†). The great trading cities of Bukhara, Merv and Samarkand weretorched to ashes in days, entire populations of men, women and children slain.The Mongols had overrun Persia by , destroyed southern Russia in –, and ravaged Poland, Silesia and Hungary in . The Mongol cavalryraids and battle-trains were the latest force in global politics, terrible in theirspeed and destructiveness. Advancing into the Near East, the Mongols nowrepresented an enormous challenge to European and Moslem security. Thesuccessor khanates of Ghagatai and the Golden Horde occupied Central Asiaand southern Russia, while the Ilkhan empire took over Asia Minor, Georgia,Syria, Mesopotamia and Persia, sacking Baghdad in  and finally destroyingthe Abbassid caliphate. A century later, Tamerlane emerged from Samarkand to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –resume the Mongol scourge of the Middle East, establishing a massive empirefrom Syria to India throughout the fourteenth century while Moslem power inthe East was reduced to the Mameluke sultanate (–) in Egypt and theLevant. Moslem sovereignty also dwindled in the West to the rump Almohádeskingdom of Granada, which would finally fall to King Ferdinand and QueenIsabella of Spain in .Articulated in the frontier zone of the western Mediterranean betweenChristendom and Islam, Lull’s esoteric evangelism was not solely directed at theconversion of the Moslems to Christianity but addressed the much wider andpressing issue of rampant Mongol power across Eurasia in the late thirteenthcentury.Ramon Lull’s Life and Works: An overviewRamon Lull was born in  in Cuitat de Majorca (now Palma) in theKingdom of Majorca, which had only been recovered from the Moorish powerstwo years earlier. The population was still one-third Moors with a strongJewish presence ever since the diaspora first settled under the Roman empire.Nowadays a sunny holiday island destination for the working populations ofnorthern Europe, Majorca was in the medieval age of sail a major mercantile,banking, insurance and shipping centre for persons and goods travelling withinthe western Mediterranean and for longer voyages from the Byzantine portsand Moslem world. Majorca lay at the centre of a commercial and intellectualnetwork that reached from the Crown of Aragon, to Pisa and Genoa, to thePapal States and Sicily. The Kingdom of Majorca itself covered an incongruousterritory comprising the Balearic Islands of Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza, theland of Roussillion in the eastern Pyrenees with a capital in Perpignan, and thecity-state of Montpellier.4Lull was born into a landed family, ultimately inheriting the estate recentlyconferred upon his father for services rendered during the victorious Christianexpedition in  of James the Conqueror (–), King of Aragon,Count of Barcelona and Lord of Montpellier, against the Almohádes Moors inthe Balearic Islands. Ramon also had good connections to the dynasty and wasmarried in  to Blanca Picany, a relative of Prince James (–), theyounger son of James the Conqueror, who became King James II of Majorca in4)The political background is drawn in Bisson,The Medieval Crown of Aragon, –.For studies of the confessional groups and their relations, see Hames,Jews, Muslims andChristians In and Around the Crown of Aragon."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –. As a wealthy young Majorcan landlord, Lull led a sensual life with fewconstraints. He composed poetry in his native Catalan tongue and became atroubadour, travelling widely and indulging the fashion for courtly love. Byhis own account, Lull led a dissipated life until  when, on five differentoccasions, he beheld the vision of Jesus Christ crucified, which brought abouthis conversion and a vision of vocation. A later account in theBreviculumofRamon describes this vocation:O Holy Virgin Mary, mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, you are closer to the visionof your Son and more elevated in the empyrean heaven than all the saints! Here onthis earth, where you are greatly honoured, called upon and sought out by so manypilgrims, I, your pilgrim, come to you with my vows, which I intend to pursue duringmy whole lifetime in this world, for the honour and praise of your Son and his holylaw and doctrine. Our most compassionate advocate, obtain from your Son that it mayplease him if certain things needed by the Christian clergy in this world were suppliedthrough my vow, namely, to make an Art, by the generosity of your great wisdom,whereby the truth of the divinity of your Son and of his holy law and doctrine couldbe demonstrated to unbelievers through necessary reasons. Secondly that devoted menof letters be found who know well the said Art which I propose to make, guided by theaction of your Son’s grace. Third, that the pope, the emperors, the kings, the princesand barons provide places where these men of letters can learn the Arabic and Hebrewlanguages, so that their voice may go out throughout the whole world, preaching thetruth of your law, and that protected passage be granted universally to the said men ofletters, and that spiritual weapons as well as the deterrence of corporeal weapons serveto establish agreement between Christians and Saracens, so that the clergy of both cometogether in agreement on what the truth is, because they are already so close to eachother.5Initially unsure how to pursue his newfound vocation of philosophical studyand missionary work, Lull went on a pilgrimage in  to Rocamadour andSantiago de Compostella. At Barcelona he met Raymond of Penyafort whoadvised him to conduct his studies in Majorca rather than at the schools ofParis. Lull then bought a Moor slave to teach him Arabic and began nine yearsof linguistic and philosophical self-education. In identifying Lull’s sources oflearning, it is significant that his scholarly studies were primarily conducted inArabic and that he knew little if any Latin. Lull’s principal object was to developan Art or system of knowledge, by means of which he could prove the divinityof Christ and the truth of Christian doctrine to the heathen, as he called theMoslems, to write an exposure of infidel errors, and to promote the teaching5)Latin caption in first miniature translated in Lull,Breviculum, –, –."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –of foreign tongues in seminaries in order to advance his missionary objects. In– Lull published his first works,Logica d’AlgatzellandThe Book ofContemplation. After the death of his slave in , Lull neglected his practicalaffairs to such an extent that, at the request of his wife and family, an officialwas appointed to administer his estate in . He withdrew to Mount Randa,a peak in the centre of the island, where he underwent a further illuminationand wrote the first version of his Art (Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem).He next visited Montpellier on the mainland, where he persuaded James II ofMajorca to build a Franciscan monastery to train missionaries on the island. In a papal bull confirmed the foundation of monastery of Miramar on thenorthwestern coast near Deja, financed by the king, where thirteen FranciscanmonkswouldstudyArabicandtheArt.LullactedasprofessorofArabicandphilosophy at Miramar for ten years, composing many controversial treatises.In  (aet. ), Lull set himself to write various works, including thenovelBlanquerna, which containsThe Book of the Lover and the Beloved,amystical text which earned him the reputation of a Christian sufi. After a visitto the papal court at Rome in  to drum up further support for his work,frustrated by the recent death of Pope Honorius IV, he journeyed on to Paris,where he met King Phillip IV (the Fair) of France. Lull remained at Paris until expounding his Art, but his teaching at the university was a failure, sincethe educated schoolmen were as much amazed by his lack of Latin languageas they were bewildered by his arcane theories of knowledge. In  Lullreturned to Montpellier, and reformulated his Art in theArs veritatis inventiva.In  he dedicated his first work on the Crusades to Pope Nicholas IV.A crisis arose in  at Genoa where Lull agonized over whether to entera monastery, but he decided on missionary action in the Islamic world andsailed for Tunis where he publicly preached Christianity to the Moslems for ayear, before he was finally imprisoned and expelled. In January  he reachedNaples where tradition alleges that he studied alchemy, an apocryphal referencebased on the many pseudo-Lullian alchemical works composed in the four-teenth and fifteenth centuries. In  and  he travelled between Naples,Majorca, Barcelona and Rome, but his efforts to interest Pope Clement V andBoniface VIII in his favorite project of establishing further missionary collegeswere unavailing. He visited Paris again in , dedicating hisTree of Phi-losophy of Loveto the king and queen of France, but was disappointed in hismain object. In  at Barcelona, however, his efforts bore fruit as he receivedpermission from King James II of Aragon to teach in all the synagogues andmosques within the kingdom. Incensed at news of renewed Mongol attacksin the Near East in , he sailed to Cyprus to expand his plan of teaching"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –oriental languages for missionary purposes in the East. He journeyed onwardsto Lesser Armenia (Gulf of Iskenderun) and possibly reached Jerusalem. AtBarcelona he received grants from the king and at Montpellier he attended ameeting between Pope Clement V and the kings of Aragon and Majorca. In he wrote his famousLiber de ascensu et decensu intellectus,whichsum-marised a Christian Neoplatonic gradation of cognitive levels.In his quest for an absolute knowledge capable of persuading by reason,Lull combined Moslem philosophy (his first formal education) with ChristianNeoplatonism, and possibly Jewish mystical sources in order to produce anideology that could unite the three creedal religions and ultimately convert theMongols. His first goal remained the conversion of the Moslems and in he crossed over the Mediterranean a second time to Bougie (Bejaia) in Africa toengage in philosophical discussion and preach the gospel, and was imprisonedthere for six months before expulsion. On being released he wrote theArsbrevisat Pisa in  and at Marseilles he met the notable alchemist Arnoldof Villanova (–). From  to  he lectured with increasingsuccess at Paris and attended the General Council at Vienne (), where hisproposals were nominally adopted. Although nearly eighty years old, Lull’s zealwas unabated. He carried on his propaganda at Majorca, Paris, Montpellierand Messina, and in  crossed over once more to Africa. At Bougie heresumed his philosophical crusade against Islam, but his measured discourseonly provoked the quick fanaticism of the Moslems.6He was stoned by anangry crowd outside the city walls and died of his wounds either on his returnvoyage or in Majorca on the  June . He was buried at the Church ofSan Francisco, Palma.The circumstances of Lull’s death caused him to be regarded as a mar-tyr, Majorcan patriotism helped to magnify his merits, and his esoteric doc-trines found many enthusiastic partisans. Thedoctor illuminatuswas veneratedthroughout Catalonia, and afterwards throughout Spain, as a saint, a thinkerand a poet. However, his doctrines were disapproved by the powerful Domini-can order, and in  they were formally condemned in a papal bull issuedat the instance of the inquisitor, Nicolas Emeric. The authenticity of this doc-ument was warmly disputed by Lull’s followers, and the bull was annulled byPope Martin V in . The controversy was renewed in  and again in. The general support of the Jesuits and the staunch fidelity of the Major-cans saved Lull from condemnation. His originality lies in his Arabic sources6)Miniatures IX and X in Lull,Breviculum,op.cit."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –of philosophy and other eclectic inspiration and his break with the scholasticsystem. The subtle ingenuity of his dialectic has compelled the admiration ofmen so far apart in opinion as Giordano Bruno and Gottfried Leibniz. Lullwas beatified by Pope Benedict XIV in , and his cult confirmed by PopePius IX in .The Art of Ramon Lull: The Quest for Absolute and Universal KnowledgeLull considered his Art as a transcendental method of production, meantto provide, not an Aristotelian abstract science (as in Latin Scholasticism),but rather an Aristotelian productive art as developed in the Arabic traditionthat he had learnt though studying Arabic literature and philosophy fromhis Moor slave. By learning Arabic, Lull had privileged access to this kindof logic and the production ofmaxima, perfections which are infinite orapproaching infinity. He believed that these provided proofs beginning notwith propositions as in Aristotelian methods of proof, but taking conceptsas the principles of a new generalised discipline applicable to all realms ofknowledge and nature (cosmos). Concepts calleddignitates(Latin) oraxiomata(Greek) were neither axioms in the sense of an Aristotelian science, nor thetranscendentals (cf.unum, verum, bonum)ofStThomasAquinas,butthebeginnings or roots of successful productive action. Lull’s Art is a method ofproduction corresponding to God’s great work of art in Creation.7Why was theArt so important? Lull believed he had discovered a method of thinking whichwas infallible because it was based on a spiritual logic based on the absolutestructure of reality which followed the true pattern of the universe. It wasthe application of logic in the theological sphere capable of demonstrating thetruth of the Incarnation and the Trinity to unbelievers. As a logical method, itwas applicable in law, medicine, and science. It was truly a cosmic knowledge.It was also based on something that engaged the strong interest of Moslems:geometry and Neo-Pythagorean ideas corresponding to these basic signs. Lullwould develop a very powerful logic based on the forms of geometry andmathesisto produce a qualitative science which does not need content: thecircle equating to the Heavens, the square equating to the Elements, and thetriangle equating to the Trinity.87)This discussion of Lull’s Art is indebted to the masterly presentation in Yates, ‘The Art ofRamon Lull’, –.8)The logic of Lull’s Art is extensively analysed in Johnston,The Spiritual Logic of RamonLlull, and in Charles H. Lohr’s numerous studies."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –As Lull’s Art progressed through several stages, the quaternary, ternary andshort, he finally named nine such principles, dignities or axioms:bonitas(good-ness),magnitudo(greatness),duratio(eternity or duration),potentia(power),sapientia(wisdom),voluntas(will),virtus(virtue),veritas(truth),gloria(glory),attributing to them an alphabetical sequence BCDEFGHIJK, which letterscould enter a logical machine that enabled them to be computed with a sys-tem of algebra, again derived from Arabic system.

Similarly, correspondences werederived for a scale of metaphysical and cognitive states from God, through theangels, planets, and man and so through descending realms of imagination andanimal sensitivity, to vegetative, elemental, and instrumental levels of being. Afurther scale offered moral correspondences with nine virtues and nine vices.With this system, enormous computations are possible. In his most simpleand final edition of the Art, Lull stressed two basic circular figures, with whichthese correspondences could be generated by moving the annular rings and thepoints of the triangle around.The first Figure (A) arranged the dignities in a circle with nine points aroundthe centre marked as A. The Figure (T) of theArs Brevis, the most simplifiedversion of his Art, involved the triangle of the Trinity turning around the circleof the heavens against the square of the four elements. In hisArs demonstra-tiva, the triangle turned round to demonstrate certain propositions within aplethora of complicated computational boxes. What were the sources of Lull’sinspiration and, most importantly, the applications to the historical situationin which he found himself?

If the dignities or principles BCDEFGHJKwere theabsoluta, divine attributes, subjects of a ladder, so germane to esotericsystems, then A was the unmoved mover at the centre, which Lull identifiedas the Trinity. The dignities BCDEFGHIK are divine attributes, each arisingthrough the primitive elemental world (elementativa), stones, through veg-etable world (vegetativa), the animal world (sensitiva), into the human world(homo), and thence through the celestial world (coelum) and to the angelic andDivine worlds (angelus, Deus).The Esoteric Sources of Lull’s InspirationLull’s initial training in Arabic language and philosophy, his background inMajorca, so recently liberated after centuries of Moslem rule and accultura-tion, together with long-standing Jewish influences in medieval Spain, offer apotential treasury of eclectic influences in his elaboration of esoteric philoso-phy. These various influences will be discussed under four principal headings:(i) Sufism; (ii) Jewish Kabbalah; (iii) Moslem philosophy and its mediation ofGreek Neoplatonism; and (iv) Christian Neoplatonism.According to the leading Arabic scholars (Arabistas) of interwar Spain,Julian Ribera y Tarrago and Miguel Asin y Palacios, Lull was effectively aChristian Sufi, whose thought and works indicated the strong influence ofthe Muhyiddin Ibn#Arabi (–), the Islamic Sufi mystic and saint.12Born in Murcia, Spain, then within the Almohádes Moorish empire, Ibn#Arabihad studied in Andalusia and North Africa, where he encountered other Sufisand experienced mystical visions. Around  he moved east and settledin Damascus, Syria. As the author of the -volumeal-Futuhat al-Makkiyah(Meccan Revelations), he created a monumental synthesis of Sufi doctrine,while hisFusus al-Hikamcombined classical Sufism with Neoplatonism and11)Lull,Liber de ascensu et descensu intellectus.12)Olabarrieta,The Influence of Ramon Lull on the Style of the Early Spanish Mystics, –."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –Islamic theology. Ibn#Arabi wrote over  works and was renowned as apoet, “El-Akbar” (“The Greatest Sheikh”) and one of the great Sufis of theMiddle Ages. According to theArabistas, it is very likely that Lull assimilatedmuch of his thought from Ibn#Arabi’s works, mediated through his study. Onerecalls that Lull learnt philosophy from Arabic sources and knew little Latin.His philosophical system was anticipated by Ibn#Arabi’sal-Futuhat,whiletheabsolutaof the “Dignities” closely related to Ibn#Arabi’s idea ofhadarat(“presences”). Finally, most convincingly, Lull composed his major work, theBook of the Lover and the Beloved, in imitation of Sufi poetry.13Jewish Kabbalah provides another potential source of Lull’s esoteric thought.Kabbalah had only recently emerged as a distinct current of Jewish mysticalphilosophy in Provence in the late twelfth century. TheSefer ha-Bahirhadintroduced the Tree of Life as a cosmological hierarchy ofsefira(spheres)alongside Merkabah mysticism, a Jewish version of the Gnostic idea of powersof God concealed within the Divine Glory (Kavod). Isaac the Blind (fl. –) of Narbonne had practised meditation on thesefira, and attracted manyJewish disciples in Provence and northern Spain. This early phase led to theSchool of Gerona in Catalonia, more theosophical and neoplatonizing, whoserepresentatives were Asher ben David, Azriel, Ezra ben Solomon, Nachmanides(b. c. ). There followed a School of Segovia in Castile, as a Gnosticreaction, with Jacob of Segovia, Moses ben Simon of Burgos, Todras ben JosephHalevi Abulafia (c. –). Finally, in Lull’s time, came a new movementof ecstatic Kabbalah, combining currents of German Hasidim with Sufismfrom the East, whose best known practioners were Abraham ben SamuelAbulafia (–), sometime at Barcelona, and his pupil Joseph Gikatillaben Abraham (fl. ).14Moshe Idel has offered some tantalizing pieces of evidence to suggest thatLull’s speculation bears the mark of contemporary Jewish Kabbalah, in partic-ular Abraham Abulafia’s ecstatic Kabbalah.

After an illumination at Barcelona in, he went to Italy, published a prophecy at Urbino in  and tried toconvert Pope Martin IV to Judaism in . Imprisoned and condemned,he escaped thanks to a minor earthquake, which his disciples took as divinesign, and went on to receive messianic revelations in Sicily in , laterfounding a millenarian-kabbalistic movement with thousands of followers inMalta. Besides the possibility of Lull and Abulafia meeting at Barcelona andelsewhere in their many travels and interfaith dialogues, Idel discovered thatcombinations of letters, states of union, and rotation were present in Picodella Mirandola’srevolutio alphabetorumbearing a strong resemblance to Lull’sconcentric circles of logical and metaphysical production. The fact that Picodella Mirandola (–) was the first figure in the Christian reception ofKabbalah in the Renaissance suggests that his sources reflect a medieval SpanishJewish model, which in turn could have been known to Lull two centuriesearlier in Spain.15Lull’s inspiration in Moslem philosophy was not limited to Sufism, obviousthough its influence was in theBook of the Lover and the Beloved. Charles Lohrhas shown how Lull was familiar with Islamic theology and knew theQur\"anand theHadith.Thereweremorespecificsourcesforhiswork.MuhammedAl-Ghazali (†) from northeast Iran, provided the basis of Lull’s first bookon logic (Logica del Gatzell). This Moslem author should not be confused withhis brother Ahmad Al-Ghazali (†), the Sufi ecstatic, whose work Lull mayhave also known. Furthermore, Ibn Sab\"in of Murcia (–) wrote themysticalBudd al-\"arif (Escape of the Gnostic)which was a definite inspirationto Lull’sLogica nova().16Although Ibn#Arabi’s Sufism was suffused with Greek Neoplatonism, theremay be another crucial source of Lull’s metaphysical speculation in Neopla-tonism, that fundamental current of esoteric philosophy that runs through allthree Abrahamic religions. Frances Yates identified a major source of Lull’s eso-teric thought in Christian Neoplatonism. Her studies in Renaissance Lullismin the s had suggested Lull’s legacy of Neoplatonic currents passed to Picodella Mirandola, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (–),Giordano Bruno (–), and Johann Heinrich Alsted (–), the15)Idel, ‘Ramon Lull and Ecstatic Kabbalah’, –, figures a-e, p. .

At King Charles’s request he translated the writings of Pseudo-Dionysiusand his commentator Maximus the Confessor. Erigena’s own philosophicalspeculation is contained in theDe divisione naturaeand the fragmentaryDeegressu et regressu animae ad Deum. Erigena was perhaps the most learned manof his time and a remarkable thinker. His thought, based on that of Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus the Confessor, the Greek Fathers, and St. Augustine, isNeoplatonic, whereby philosophy and theology are identified; all thinking andbeing begin and end with God, who is above all being and thought. Erigenamakes a fourfold division of the things that are, or nature—that which createsand is not created; that which is created and creates; that which is created anddoes not create; that which neither creates nor is created. The first is God, thesource of all things. The second is the Logos, existent in, and coeternal with,God, in whom are the primordial causes and types of things. The third is theworld of space, time, and generation, which came into being from the primor-dial causes by emanation through the successive genera and species. The fourthis again God, but regarded now as the end of all things; for just as creatures haveemanated from God, so they will return to Him.19Yates found a definite clueto Lull’s “Dignities” in Erigena’sDe divisione naturae, in which she discernedthe seminal influence of Pseudo-Dionysius’Celestial Hierarchieswith its nine-fold hierarchies of angels and being. Dionysius the Areopagite (fl. ) wasmost likely a Syrian monk who may have studied with the Greek Neoplaton-ists Proclus and Damascius before the closure of the pagan school of Athens andhis own conversion to Christianity. His transmutation of Neoplatonic meta-physics and hierarchies of being and ascent into Christian angelic orders hasremained a seminal text of esoteric spirituality and philosophy. Through Eri-gena’s Latin translation it entered the medieval Latin West and subsequentlyinfluenced German medieval mystics, the Florentine Neoplatonists, and thebirth of Chritstian theosophy in the late sixteenth century.17)Yates,The Art of Memory, passim.18)Yates, ‘Ramon Lull and John Scotus Erigena’, –.19)Carabine,John Scottus Eriugena, –, –, –."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –The Christian Origins of IslamWith Lull’s debt to Erigena and the latter’s to Pseudo-Dionysius, we findwe are returning from late Moorish Spain in the century before Lull’s birthto the sources of Moslem philosophy and science in the East. Pioneeringscholars such as Margaret Smith, De Lacy O’Leary and Julian Baldick haveeach shown the crucial importance of the eastern Christian churches such asthe Nestorian, Jacobite and Syrian Churches to the origins of Islam. It is awell-known thesis that the Moslem Arabs east of the River Jordan so muchadmired the Christian desert monks and hermits for their ascetic fervour andsolitary prayer, that they adopted their woollen (suf)garbandthusbecameknown as Sufis. Others have noted the common link stressed between Godand men, and prayers in Remembrance of God. Paul Fenton has noted thecontemporary parallels between the Hesychast tradition of Mount Athos, theJesus Prayer, the Sufidhikr Allah, and the Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia withits ecstatic repetitions, as repetitive phrases invoking the remembrance of God.These experiential traditions suggest the ecstatic and practical influence of earlyChristian mysticism at the heart of Islam.20The Christian influence on the origins of Islam is well established. As Mar-garet Smith has stated: ‘Syria and Palestine had been the first home of Chris-tianity, and from its first foundation in Jerusalem, Damascus and Antioch,the Church had extended itself as far as the Arabian desert. Bishoprics wereestablished beyond the Jordan, and in Palmyra and the district east of Jordanwere to be found many Christian hermits, who influenced many of the desertArabs, and won numbers of them to Christianity’.21In the Christendom of, the church had largely adopted the institutions and administrative prac-tices of the Roman Empire. However, in the eastern borderland areas of Arabia,Syria and Mesopotamia where the Arab tribes first entered history, Hellenismwas a potent and continuous cultural force. ‘Muslim theology, philosophy, andscience put forth their first luxuriant shoots on a soil that was saturated withHellenistic culture’.22As De Lacy O’Leary has argued, the Hellenistic heritagewas continuously diffused in the borderlands of Syria, Mesopotamia and Persia,first through the Seleucids (bc – bc), then through the Romans in theircontinuous wars with the Parthians (bc – ad) and then through Chris-20)Fenton, ‘Rabbi Abraham Abulafia’s Method of Kabbalistic Meditation’.21)Smith,The Way of the Mystics, .22)Nicholson,Mystics of Islam,."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –tianity.23In the Roman frontier provinces of Syria, Palmyra and Mesopotamia,which regularly fluctuated between Roman rule and the Parthian kingdomand (after ) Sassanian Persia, the Nestorian Church had established largechurches and congregations at Nisibis, Edesssa, Jundishapur and Seleucia. Herein the East, while still subject to persecution in the Roman empire, Chris-tianity had been tolerated by the Sassanian kings of Persia, who allowed theirRoman captives and subjects to build churches and develop congregations.Moreover, there was less centralization in respect of governance and doctrine.Later, the Nestorian and Monophysite (Jacobite) churches would become evermore detached on account of their distance and removal from the great ecclesi-astical centres of Antioch and Constantinople, their doctrines assimilating localcoloration in response to oriental congregations. In due course, Constantinoplewould declare the Churches of the East schismatic and later heretical but theyessentially mediated Hellenistic and Christian thought, science and medicineto the Arab tribes in these territories.24Islam readily adopted a great deal ofChristian and Persian traditions. By the time Mohammed appeared on theworld-stage, Christianity was well established in Arabia, Mesopotamia andPersia and Christian Neoplatonic mysticism came to play an important partin orthodox Islamic philosophy. Jundishapur, Nisibis and Edessa remainedpowerful bishoprics in the Christian East and Mohammed sought not seekto eradicate Christianity; rather, Moslems were only too happy to learn sci-ence, architecture medicine and philosophy from the Christians and the Per-sians.The savage Mongol invasions through Central Asia in the early thirteenthcentury swept away the Church in the East at its historic centres of Samarkand,Bukhara, Merv, Seleucia-Ctesiphon and Jundishapur. Vine reports that ‘TheMongols were not hostile to Christianity as a religion itself, but neverthelesspresented an acute danger to Christian peoples. This was due to the rapidityand savagery of the invading hordes’. A contemporary source described theMongol horsemen ‘clothed with skins and riding the wind and tempest, theyoverturned in the twinkling of an eye the strongest towns’. Within minutes ofthe bells tolling in the Christian cities of Central Asia ‘they seemed to spring up23)O’Leary,Arabic Thought and Its Place in History, ; idem,How Greek Science Passed tothe Arabs, .24)Vine,The Nestorian Churches,Stewart,Nestorian Missionary Enterprise, –, –.

They covered the earth like the waters of a flood andno one could resist them’.25Rich communities on the Silk Road were reducedto ashes and cinders within a week.By the second decade of the thirteenth century the Jacobite and Nestorianchurches had disappeared under Mongol fire and pillage in Central Asia andBaghdad had also been sacked in . But the Church of the East haddisseminated the Hellenistic and Christian legacy to the Moslem world in itsascendant phase of the seventh to eighth centuries. Five hundred years later, inthe West, Ramon Lull constructed an esoteric synthesis to convert the Moslemsand the Mongols, now a clear and present danger.Why did Lull launch his mission of esoteric evangelism?As Lull had recorded in his vision of vocation, he sought agreement betweenChristians and Saracens, ‘because they are already so close to each other’.Indeed, there was much commonality: early Sufism of the eighth and ninthcenturies had combined with mystical Christian spirituality and Neoplaton-ism, while Judaism provided the legalistic boundaries of Islam. Aristotelian andNeoplatonic themes were common to both Islam and Christianity. As JulianBaldick has suggestively phrased it, ‘Islam both is and is not Christianity’.26InLull’s view, there was a need to overcome creedal and theological disagreementthough the examination of the philosophy and logic shared by the great faiths.His quest for a logical and metaphysical system based onabsoluta,the“digni-ties” or axioms, was intended to demonstrate to Moslems that Christianity wasa logical map of metaphysical order. Just as Islam’s cradle had lain in the Eastwithin Hellenism and Christianity, so he in the West proposed their reunionfor there now existed the threat that, without strong united resistance, theywould both be destroyed. The Mongols had already destroyed more than halfthe Moslem world in a graphic clash of civilization in the thirteenth century.In Lull’s view, there were two world civilizations and the hordes. Against Mon-gol catastrophe, mass slaughter and the collapse of Islamic power, Lull saw theneed for the combination of Islam and Christianity to generate a world ref-ormation and global redemption from barbarism in Eurasia. Christianity hadto convert the Mongols but they were presently blocked by Islam. Moreover,Lull saw that if the Mongols were not converted to Christianity they would beconverted to Islam; an accurate prediction of what ultimately occurred among25)Vine,The Nestorian Churches, –.26)Baldick,Mystical Islam, –."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke / ARIES . () –the populations of West and Central Asia.27Ramon Llull took the view that heshould concentrate his attention on Islam as the most coherent and importantnon-Christian religion in the medieval world. In some ways he resembles thecontemporary world strategist Samuel P. Huntingdon writing just a few yearsbefore .., who evaluated the Sinic and Islamic challenges to the West.28While Huntington asserted the core values of the West in its classical legacy,the separation of spiritual and temporal authority, social pluralism, representa-tive institutions, the rule of law, and individualism, Lull also believed that suchqualities, the legacy of Hellenism and Christianity, could be demonstrated byhis esoteric Art. Such universalism embracing both faiths, underpinned by love,will and deterrence, could secure a new world order and security.BibliographyBaldick, Julian,Mystical Islam: An Introduction to Sufism, London: I.B.
