The events that led to the charges againstGoossens were initiated by the discovery of a series of letters he hadwritten to Rosaleen Norton (1917-1979), the ìnotoriousî Witch of KingsCross, an occultist and esoteric artist, which detailed his practice of sexmagic with her and her companion Gavin Greenlees (1930-1983). Thecorrespondence, which can be dated betweenc.1953-c.1955, had beenstolen from Norton and Greenleesí flat in September 1955 by Joe MorrisSenior, a crime reporter forThe Sun. Morris handed over the letters tothe police who subsequently placed the unsuspecting Goossens undersurveillance prior to and during his time abroad.Detective Sergeant Bert Trevenar of the Sydney Vice Squad, the chiefinvestigator of the events of 1956, kept a copy of the correspondencein his Ashfield home until his death in 2003.1The originals were lost,possibly destroyed by the police, when they failed to gain permission toprosecute Goossens on an additional charge of scandalous conduct.The latter charge was dropped because of the intervention of theAttorney General and Minister of Justice, Mr R. R. Downing, who,according to Carole Rosen (1993):... instructed the Commissioner of Police to take no furtheraction against him on the grounds that the evidence did notdisclose any criminal offence with which he could be charged.Premier Cahill, when questioned as to his future, emphasisedthat he had been fined under a Federal Act. The Crown lawauthorities had examined the police report of the case anddecided to take no further action against him.

The apparent absence of scholarlydiscourse may be partially in response to the subject of sex magic andthe esoteric in general that has until recent years remained as a subjectworthy of enquiry only outside the academy (cf. Owen 1997). The trioísoccult interests, particularly in sex magic, have, however, been treatedin three separate genres: the print media, creative works anddocumentaries. In most instances, the letters have been utilized tovarying degrees ranging from direct quotation to artistic interpretation.David Salter, in his 1999 lead article for theSydney Morning Herald,ìTheStrange Case of Sir Eugene and the Witch,î discussed the letters andquoted from them. In the research for the 1990 fictionalized account ofthe relationship between Goossens and Norton for the novelPagan,Inez Baranay accessed the correspondence and utilized it, particularlyin Chapter 28 entitled ìThe Letters.î There have been four plays: BarryLoweísRosaleen ñ The Wicked Witch of the Cross(1983), Timothy DalyísComplicity(1998),The Witch of Kings Crossdirected by Jocelyn McKinnon(2003), and Louis Nowra and Mandy SayerísThe Devil is a Woman(2003).2The latter was promoted as a documentary-drama based onextracts from diaries, letters, poems, fiction and non-fiction althoughthe authors later claimed that references to the letters were removedowing to legal threats over alleged breach of copyright.

Partially inspired by the letters,Crawford was also threatened with a legal injunction, but, as with Nowraand Sayerís play, the show went on.4It is the subject of Goossensí letters ñ his practice of sex magic withNorton and Greenlees ñ that constitutes the theme of this essay. Farfrom contributing to the scandalous reputation of the three individualsinvolved, it is anticipated that this research will augment the limitedacademic material available on magic in Twentieth Century Australia.It is an exegesis of a personal experience and represents Goossens,Norton, and Greenlees as serious adherents to an occult system thathas been, and sometimes remains, quintessentially misunderstood. Italso makes use of Nortonís writings and artwork to augment theexamination of her life as an occultist and to complement Goossensídescriptions of sex magic with her and Greenlees.The analysis begins with a survey of the practices of Aleister Crowley(1875-1947)5whose multitudinous writings (seldom read by hisdetractors) reveal another side to the man popularly regarded as wicked(cf. Sutin 2000). This paper does not seek to defend Crowleyís ethicsand certain ritual activities but aims to discuss his philosophical systems,particularly sex magic. This will provide a basis for the assessment ofthe rites of Goossens, Norton, and Greenlees, whose magical practicespaid significant deference to Crowleyís work."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"238 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5Crowley and Sex MagicHugh Urban (2003) notes that ì[Crowley] stands out as one of thoseremarkably enigmatic characters who has had a tremendous impact oncontemporary new religious movements, esotericism and occultism, evenas he has been almost entirely ignored by academic scholarship.î (p139). Indeed, it is Crowley, as opposed to, for example, Gerald Gardner,who served as the major influence on Norton, Greenlees and Goossenswhen it came to sex magic.Crowley is exceptionally well-known among scholars and practitionersof magic and related traditions and is usually regarded as infamous,immoral, if not terrifying by those among the general public even vaguelyfamiliar with his name. Arguably, Crowleyís most significant contributionto western esotericism was the theory and practice of sex magic, acomplicated system that was partially developed in 1904 as a result ofseveral visits he and his wife, Rose, made to the Boulak Museum inCairo, during which they experienced communications with an entitycalled Aiwass (or Aiwaz), a messenger of Horus. A well-documentedepisode in the life of Crowley, the Cairo experience led to theLiber Alvel Legis(1936), a text in which he chronicled and analysed the significanceof the encounters, the result of which was the beginning of hisphilosophies on sex magic:Now ye shall know that the chosen priest and apostle ofinfinite space is the prince-priest The Beast, and in his womancalled The Scarlet Woman is all power given. They shall gathermy children into their fold: they shall bring the glory of thestars into the hearts of men. For he is ever a sun and she amoon ...

Sex magic was intended to notonly bring about the conception of ìa child mightier than all the kingsof the earthî (Crowley 1936, III.44-45) but also to lead to the attainmentof absolute consciousness.The intrusion of Karl Theodor Reuss (1855-1923), founder of theOrdoTempli Orientis(O.T.O.), into Crowleyís London apartment in May 1912is sometimes regarded as the unofficial ñ and unceremonious ñ revelationof a deeper significance of sex magic to Crowley (for a discussion ofthis event and its chronological problems, cf. Kaczynski 2002, pp. 202-3; Sutin 2000, pp. 225-26; and Owen 1997). According to RichardKaczynski (2002), Reuss ranted about Crowleyís unauthorised use ofì[t]he magic secret of sexî (p 202) contained in the secret documentsof the O.T.O. Crowley was bemused until Reuss placed a copy ofCrowleyísThe Book of Lies(1913) before him. The text contained theìThe Star Sapphire,î a ritual that included the following: ìLet the Adeptbe armed with his Magick Rood [and provided with his Mystic Rose]îand ìLet him drink of the Sacrament and let him communicate thesame.î For the first time Crowley became aware of the sexual symbolisminherent in his writing as it applied to the IX∞ initiation of the O.T.O.

Crowleywas astonished (he had, for example, taken the rood as the cross) ñ notso much about the allegations of plagiarism and breaking the code ofsilence of the O.T.O. ñ but by the revelations Reussí arrival had heralded.According to Lawrence Sutin (2000), the two spent the following hoursin intense discussion, resulting in Reuss conferring upon Crowley theIX∞ and, later, the X∞ along with the title of ìSupreme Rex and SovereignGrand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britainsî (p 226).Crowley assumed the magical title Baphomet, an idol believed to beworshipped by the Order of the Knights Templar, to whom the O.T.O.claimed occult lineage. The origin of the name is uncertain: a corruptionof Mahomet (Mohammed); a combination of the Greek wordsbapheandmetis(ìabsorption of wisdomí); or, in the system devised by EliphasLevi (1910), a symbol of the ìUniversal Agent,î the all-powerful forcein ìNatureî that the adept can adapt and guide. Leviís artisticinterpretation of Baphomet, entitledThe Sabbatic Goat, clearly inspiredsome of Nortonís work. For example, there is a photograph printed intheSydney Truthon 7 September 1952 that shows Nortonís mural ofBaphomet on the office wall of her publisher, Walter Glover. Likewise,Nevill Druryís ìIntroduction to the Second Editionî ofThe Art ofRosaleen Norton with Poems by Gavin Greenlees(1982) notes that ìTherewere other major deities too [besides Pan]: Lucifer, Baphomet, Hecate,Jupiterî (p.8).Crowley had experimented with sex magic prior to this revelation, asexemplified by the Cairo sojourn and also the time he spent in the NorthAfrican desert in 1909. Accompanied by his novice Victor Neuburg(1883-1940), Crowley performed a series of rites, spiritually terrifying"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 241and dangerous, which involved crossing the thirty Aethyrs (or Aires) ñmetaphysical spirit spheres surrounding the earthly plane. Kaczynski(2002) states that Crowley had attempted this in Mexico in 1900 butcould not ìpass through or comprehend any Aethyrs beyond the firsttwoî (p 71). Crowley understood the meaning of the Aethyrs in termsof the system of magic practised by the Elizabethan scholar and occultistDr John Dee (1527-1608) and his diviner Edward Kelley (1555-c.1593)and the adaptation thereof by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,of which Crowley had been a member (1898-1900). This involved angelmagic based on the Kabbalistic tradition as adapted by Henry CorneliusAgrippa (1486-1535), which Dee had modified to develop his Enochiansystem: a cosmology of angels and demons as well as thirty otherworldlyrealms, which he called Aethyrs.In 1909 Crowley aimed to regress through the thirty Aethyrs over aperiod of several days with Neuburg assisting and recording the visions(as a Kelley to his Dee). During his attempt at contemplating thefourteenth Aethyr, however, he experienced an obstacle in the form ofan angel who ordered him to depart (Crowley 1911). On descent fromMount D·leh Addin, where the rite had been attempted, Crowley wasinspired to build an altar to the god Pan and offer a sacrifice. This sacrificetook human form: to experience the fourteenth Aethyr the magussacrificed himself via submission to Neuburg in the form of homosexualpassivity.The theme and concept of offering oneself for sacrifice, an ancientMediterranean tradition, was a keystone of anthropological works thatinspired Crowley, such as James FrazerísThe Golden Bough. The practicepermeated the occult revival as epitomized by Rosicrucianism and the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"242 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5Golden Dawn, as well as featuring in Masonic rites, which in turn hadinspired the aforementioned magical societies. Crowleyís experience inthe North African desert, where he attempted to enter Deeís fourteenthAethyr, exemplifies the magical connections he made between accessingvarious esoteric planes, encountering angelic and demonic entitiestherein, and negation of the conscious self through sexual ritual in orderfor this to be achieved.After the sexual ritual with Neuburg, Crowley again embarked on hisEnochian quest and encountered Chorozon (the Dweller of the Abyss).The Abyss is connected withDaíath, the so-called eleventh sephirah onthe Tree of Life. Alex Owen (1997) describes Crowleyís understandingof the term, after the time in the desert: ìIt represented Dispersion: aterrifying chaos in which there was no centre and no correspondingconsciousness.î (p. 111).The episode of 1909 is a salient example of Crowleyís understandingof sex magic. What he and Neuburg experienced in the desert ìprefiguredhis elaboration of the techniques of sex magicî (Owen 1997, pp. 99-100), which he was to consciously pursue ñ especially after Reussí arrivalon his doorstep in 1912. The quest for heightened imagination and powerthrough self-sacrifice and the subsequent obliteration of the ego cameto underline Crowleyís system of sex magic. The rites that evolved,which included autoeroticism and homoeroticism in addition toheterosexual sex, became a significant component of Crowleyísreworking of the various degrees of initiation in the O.T.O. under hisleadership (which he assumed in 1922 and held until his death in 1947)and the main focus of his own order, theArgenteum Astrum(Silver Star),established in 1907."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 243Crowleyís legacy, most notably sex magic, has had a profound impacton practitioners of magic, quite often through direct means via hiswritings or through the conveyance of his work via interpreters. Crowleyísfamous mantra, as quoted below, was to inspire occultists into theTwentieth Century and beyond:I personally believe that if this secret [of sexual magic], whichis a scientific secret, were perfectly understood, as it is noteven by me after more than twelve yearsí almost constantstudy and experiment, there would be nothing which thehuman imagination can conceive that could not be realized inpractice.

Despite her adult poverty, living insquats and impoverished flats in Kings Cross and other inner-city suburbs,Nortonís family was well-off and she lived a comfortable, middle-classchildhood until she chose to leave it behind and make her own way inthe world at the age of 16. While working in an assortment of jobs inthe city, then hitch-hiking along the north and south coasts of Australia,Norton developed her artistic talents and read various occult texts. Onreturning to Sydney, Norton dedicated her time to her art and burgeoningmagic activities. Her pictures were published in the alternative journalPertinentduring the early 1940s and her first exhibition in 1949, held atthe Rowden-White Library at The University of Melbourne, suggested"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"244 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5a promising start to a public career had it not ended in a court case forobscenity (cf. Drury 2002, pp. 39-40). Undeterred, she continued topaint and draw, and in 1952The Art of Rosaleen Norton with Poems byGavin Greenleeswas released to extensive media coverage for its allegedvile nature. Another court case ensued.After the drama of Goossensí arrest in 1956, Norton continued to beinterviewed by various tabloid journalists and her life was extensivelychronicled, almost always in an exaggerated, voyeuristic manner for theprurient interests of the Australian public. During the late 1960s anduntil the early 1970s, however, she tended to shun publicity, living quietlynear her beloved sister, Cecily, surrounded by an assortment of animalcompanions. She left the earthly plane on 5 December 1979, herdeparture the result of colon cancer. Greenless followed her, four yearslater to the day.Norton was clearly influenced by Crowleyís work, most notably hisMagickin Theory and Practice, although she also refers to the writings of EliphasLevi (1810-1875), Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891), Alice Bailey (1880-1949) and Dion Fortune (1890-1946).6Nortonís determination not onlyto explore and develop her belief system, but also to publiclyacknowledge it, occurred at a time when witchcraft was still illegal inAustralia (cf. Hume 1997, p. 224). Although dubbed a ìwitchî by thetabloids and eventually embracing the title herself, Nortonís religionwas far from stereotypical witchcraft (for example, Satanism, gross formsof sacrifice and other related inversions of Christianity). Her worshipand beliefs were intense, complex, and eclectic; in addition to theaforementioned authors, her system of magic drew on the Kabbalah,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 245Theosophy, and world mythology articulated through her readings andinterpretations of Sigmund Freud and, more significantly, Carl Jung.In contrast, Greenleesí early occult experience is not documentedalthough his precocious poetic talent reveals an early interest in surrealistliterature and visionary or mystical poetry. The major influences onGreenlees included Comte de LautrÈamont (1846-1870), ArthurRimbaud (1854-1891) and Peter D. Ouspensky (1878-1947).LautrÈamontís work was characterized by its overtly obscene imagery,which created visionary, nightmarish scenes peopled by blasphemouscharacters intent on evil. Rimbaud, like LautrÈamont, was regarded as aprecursor to the Surrealists and experimented with free verse andsynethesia(the representation of one sense experience in terms ofanother). He urged fellow poets to become seers by the submission ofthe self to a total derangement of the senses. Ouspensky was also anexperimenter in alternative states of consciousness and promoted theoccult teachings of the Armenian mystic Gurdjieff (1878-1947). Thesesources of inspiration are present in the poems Greenlees was writingby the age of thirteen, as evidenced in his work forPertinent, whichincluded the dreamscape pieces entitledPoem(May 1944) andThe Square(June 1944). As Nortonís artwork was also published and reviewed inPertinent(for example, October 1941), the pair may have sought outeach other as a result of a perceived ìconnection.î Drury (1988)suggests that it is ìlikely that Roie and Gavin first met one another inthe last year of the war, when Beresford [Nortonís husband at the time]was away in New Guinea and Roie was living in the stables in BayswaterRoad [inner Sydney].

In a letter to C. S. Lewis dated14 November 1952, Norton referred to Pan as ìthe unfallen one whoexpresses Itself throughî the ìpowers of Earth:î ìgeological activity,îìanimals, vegetation, [and] place intelligencesî (Norton in Drury 1988,p. 76).7Her definition of Pan was closely aligned to her interpretationsof Gnosticism and the Kabbalah in particular: she worshipped the god,ìthe Elemental,î (Norton in Drury 1988, p. 76) who functioned as aìneutralising powerî (Norton in Drury 1988, p. 79) juxtaposed to AdamKadmon (the archetypal human; the body of God), ìthe fallen Ö theone who expresses itself through the human raceî (Norton in Drury1988, p. 76). Norton articulated her system, beginning with Pan:A being whose state has been supreme delight and harmony,who has expressed nothing but goodwill ñ and knew of noother ñ and who had reached for still higher forms ofmanifestations Ö Adam K. would have destroyed all hiscreation Ö and any other under his influence, except for theneutralising power of Pan the Elemental. (Norton in Drury1988, p. 79)Norton and Greenleesí worship of Pan may have been partiallyinfluenced by Crowley, whose rituals to the god played a significant rolein the workings in 1919. InMagick(1929 [1973]), Crowley included anelaborate hymn to the god prefaced by an excerpt from the Greek tragedyAiasby Sophocles (496-406 BC). Owenís work on Neuburg andCrowleyís time in the desert references CrowleyísConfessions, in whichCrowley defines the god as ìAll devourer, all begetterî (1997, p. 130)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 247For Crowley, to understand Pan is to understand ìPanic,î and ìto knowìPanicî is to experience both ecstasy and terror at the hand of the godî(Owen 1997, p. 130). Owen goes on to write:Pan, representative of a pagan Greece that had specialsignificance for Victorian homosexual men, and longassociated in the Christian imagination with the devil, was apowerful signifier of the sexualized magic initiated by the twomen. When Crowley and Neuburg speak of Pan, the imagery isredolent with heat and violence; a god, half man, half beast,who rapes and ravishes men and women alike. (Owen 1997, p.130; cf. also Newman 2004, pp. 36-61).In addition to Crowleyís profound experiences of the god, and hisnarratives elucidating these, Fortuneís work, particularly her 1936 novelThe Goat Foot God, ìdid honour to Pan as the prime symbol of a paganismneeded to heal the modern worldî (Hutton 1999, p. 85). Here we detectan alternative comprehension of Pan in comparison to Crowleyísexperiences of the god; an understanding which, nevertheless, was ofinterest to Norton:Some occult theories hold the stars and planets to be thebodies of great beings and so do I. I think the God Pan is thespirit whose body ñ or such of it as can be seen in these fourdimensions (the fourth being time) ñ is the planet Earth, andwho, therefore, in a very real sense, is the ruler and god of thisworld. Perhaps that is why he was given the name ëPan, whichin Greek means ëAllí, for he is the totality of lives, elementsand forms of being ñ organic, ëinorganicí and otherwise,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"248 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5comprising the planet as a whole: much as an animal body is atotality of myriads of cells, bacteria etc, in which orderedwhole these live and function, having their own forms ofìintelligenceî and perception, according to type.Such a bodywould be the ìworldî to any of its micro-organisms, and theintegrated consciousness of the bodyís owner would exist inanother ìworldî, and on a different plane from theirs. (Norton1957, p. 15)Nortonís understanding of ìdifferent plane[s]î is highly relevant to anappreciation of the magical content of the letters she received fromGoossens. Her practice of self-hypnosis as a means of artisticenlightenment (begun inc.1940) was the beginning of a process thatindeed carried over into the realm of astral travel (mentioned byGoossens in several correspondences).Her development of trance art techniques, partially inspired by thepractices of the Surrealists, notably Salvador Dali and Yves Tanguy (cf.Drury 1994, p. 106), had a profound effect on her art and life. As meansof example, the following is an extract from an account she wrote topsychologist L. J. Murphy in 1949:Eventually I decided to experiment in self-induced trance; theidea being to induce an abnormal state of consciousness andmanifest the results, if any, in drawing. May aim was to delvedown into the subconscious and, if possible, through andbeyond it.[A description of the trance process follows.]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 249The drawings were quite different in form from previous ones,and full of symbols, many of which were previously unknownto my conscious mind Ö prominent symbols being crescent,fish, ram-headed mask, cornucopia, swastika, 6-pointed star,triple sign, tower, etc.Each of the drawings at this period were compositions havinganother significance not realised until much later, since theyprophesied in symbolic form a future subjective experience formyself.Numerous other things took place which I need not recordhere: my consciousness, however, was extremely exalted overthe entire periodñabout five months in all. I seemed, whileexperiencing a great intensification of the intellectual, creativeand intuitional faculties, to have become detached in acuriously timeless fashion from the world around me, and yetto be seeing things with a greater clarity and awareness thannormally. I was working day and night, having very little sleepor rest, yet a supply of inexhaustible power seemed to flowthrough me. (Norton in Drury 1988, p. 30)As the following passages from the same account reveal, the practicethat enabled astral communication with higher beings involved morecomplex magic, of which Norton became an adept:I had heard that it was possible to achieve transition to adifferent Realm of existence and live consciously the type oflife that is generally experienced after physical death.[There"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"250 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5follows passages describing Nortonís preparations forthis event, her various experiences leading up to it, anearly experience and finally an explication.]I doubt if any impression of the actual initial experience couldbe conveyed in words, so I shall not attempt to describe it,beyond saying that there was a sensation of ecstasy, duringwhich my entire being seemed to dissolve and disintegrate,then gradually re-form into a new whole.[The descriptioncontinues, and then Norton describes the physicalsensations.]Far from being devoid of sense enjoyments, aplasmic body of this type contains the very essence ofsensuousness to a degree that renders the physical sensoryorgans utterly negligible by comparison.[This is elaborated.]ëThere,í the body is completely a reflection of the mind, sothat any type of pleasure, whether emotional or intellectual,engenders as part of itself a corresponding sensuousenjoyment.[This is elaborated.]Contrary again to the usual idea of such states, sexualsensation still exists in an equivalently more advanced andintensified form.I have been asked how a purely intellectual activity such asabstract thought could be attended by sensual enjoyment. It is,nevertheless, for instead of feeling interested one ëbecomesían embodiment of Interest itself. It is rather difficult toexplain what I mean by this since a sense or state ofConsciousness peculiar to the other realm is concerned.

There, ëthoughtí orrather the energy generated by such is felt as a tangible thing, acurrent of living force which assumes palpable or visual form.I had been told, earlier, that ëentities in the Plane assumedform at willí. This is literally true; one actually changes shapevery frequently, since the new ësenseí referred to is that whichcould be described as ëbeingí. (Norton in Drury 1988, pp. 34-35)Nortonís descriptions of her psychic travel through inner and outerworlds or planes of consciousness are, as she noted, difficult to describein written form. Her letter to Murphy, nevertheless, raises some keyinterpretations, particularly when juxtaposed to her artisticrepresentations of these experiences.Prior to meeting Goossens in 1952/1953, Norton (with Greenlees) wasalso a practitioner of sex magic. The work entitledWitchesí Sabbath,included in Nortonís 1949 exhibition at the Rowden-White Library atThe University of Melbourne, exemplifies her experience with such ritesñ albeit in exaggerated form (the rituals did not include bestiality, forexample). Here a demonic animal and witch embrace in an ecstaticmoment of joyful lust while a crucified, naked nun (top left) and asensuous, winking Virgin Mary (top right) look on. Police confiscatedthis picture, along withLucifer,TriumphandIndividuation, after twoofficers attended the exhibition in response to alleged complaints."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"252 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5Norton explained to one of them, Detective John Olsen, thatBlackMagic(another name forWitchesí Sabbath) ìwas a ësymbolisticí drawing:the female figure depicted was a witch, the panther personified thepowers of darkness, and their embrace represented the initiation of thewitch into the ëinfernal mysteries.íî (Norton in Drury 1988, p. 40).Despite the fact that Norton was charged under the Police OffencesAct of 1928 and appeared before a court hearing while the remainingworks were still being exhibited, she included a revised version of thework, re-entitledBlack Magic(Plate I) in the 1952 publication,The Artof Rosaleen Norton with Poems by Gavin Greenlees. This confident decisionmay have been motivated by the fact that the court case was resolvedin her favor. Such confidence, however, was misplaced, as the artisticcollaboration between Norton and Greenlees was to cause anotherobscenity charge.8In the book (p. 42),Black Magicwas accompanied by one of Nortoníspoems, which elaborates on the theme of the piece and points to hererotic sacred rites; an excerpt follows:Lightís Black Majesty: Midnight Sun: Lord of the wild andliving stars:Soul of Magic and master of Death;Panther of Night Ö enfold me.Take me, dark Shining One; mingle my being with you,Prowl in my spirit with deep purring joyLive in me, giver of terror and ecstasyTouch me with tongues of black fire."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 2531.

Her experiences thereforediffered from the standard Jungian interpretation of the CollectiveUnconscious that entailed an interpretation of other-wordly beings asìprojected thought formsî (Drury 1994, p. 109); she believed that thedeities and demons of these planes were real and could be contacted.In view of her statements concerning her earlier experiences of trancetechniques, which inspired her art and supplied her with ìinexhaustiblepower,î the more highly developed practice of astral communicationmay be interpreted as enabling her to access a more exalted level ofconsciousness and creativity.Nortonís artwork remains the best expression of her experiences, asfurther demonstrated by the work entitledAt Home(Plate 2) includedinThe Art of Rosaleen Norton with Poems by Gavin Greenlees. This piececombines a comfortably comic home setting with a figure depicting theartist experiencing a psychic visitation from a range of beings.

Brother Jannicot also hasother names known only to his most intimate friends; and it isbelieved that he is an extremely important Personage.Certainly he is to me since he manages most of my occultactivities, supervises trances, escorts me into other planes ofBeing, and sometimes assists the Sphynx in selecting visionsfor me. (p. 74)Asmodeus, the chief conveyor of Norton to her astral planes, referredto as Abaddon in The Apocalypse (ix.11), features in a narrative in theapocryphal Book of Tobias (iii.8) and is also mentioned in the Testamentof Solomon. InThe Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon the King, translatedby S. L. MacGregor Mathers with an essay by Crowley, Asmodeus (calledAsmoday or Asmodai) is the thirty-second spirit of the seventy-twolisted:He is a Great King, Strong, and Powerful.

Otherssay that he was the Demon of impurity.î As Goossensí letters show,Asmodeus was to play a part in their rites.Goossens had occult interests and possibly practical experience prior tomeeting Norton and Greenless. Born in England to a musically giftedfamily, Goossens came to Australia in 1947 to become the firstpermanent conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and assumedirectorship of the Conservatorium. He wrote to Norton in response tothe publication released in September 1952, which he had purchased atthe Notanda Gallery; Norton subsequently invited him to tea. Thissuggests a meeting sometime late that year or during the following year.In addition to being well-versed in occult writings, particularly those ofCrowley, Goossensí circle of friends in England included composer andpianist Cyril Scott (1879-1970) and Philip Heseltine (1894-1930),composer, critic, and editor, better known as Peter Warlock.9Scott,described by one his teachers, Iwan Knorr, as ìbrilliant andrevolutionary,î (cited by Rowena Pearce) and by Goossens as the ìfatherof British modern music,î (Tame 1984, p. 264) was an occultist whopublished extensively on Theosophy, theology, philosophy, and various"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"258 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 53. Examples of Goosensí Letters"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 259other esoteric matters. The series of works known collectively as TheInitiate Books, penned under a pseudonym, reveals Scottís activeinvolvement with Theosophy, expressly the work of Blavatsky and herphilosophy of the ìGreat White Brotherhood,î an assembly ofHimalayan masters who possessed the mystical powers to connecthumans with the masters of the divine cosmic hierarchy.Scott actively explored occultism, particularly the connection betweenesotericism, music, and literature although, unlike Heseltine andGoossens, he openly articulated his research and practices. InMusic: ItsSecret Influence Throughout the Ages,10Scott expounded his Theosophicalbeliefs in a discussion of the ìtwo types of composers; those we mayrefer to as the inspired ones, in that they possess qualities which permitof their being used by the Higher Powers, as opposed to these, theuninspired ones, who, lacking such qualities, cannot be used as mediumsî(1933 [1958], p. 28). In turn, it is not only the esoteric forces that inspiregreat works; great works inspire humanity and its spiritual awakening.As with Heseltine, the direct influences of Scott on Goossens in termsof occultism cannot be traced owing to the absence of directcommunication between the men on the subject. Goossensí circle ofclose friends, which clearly included these men, nevertheless point to afriendship not only based on music and composition, but also on a sharedpersonal philosophy despite its different manifestations.11According to Goossensí younger sister, the celebrated harpist DameSidonie Goossens-Millar, her brotherís interest in the occult can be datedfrom the time of his friendship with Heseltine (cf., Rosen 1993, p. 339and also Smith). Goossens and Heseltine were close companions during"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"260 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5their youth, and in his autobiography released in 1951 Goossens recordsa summer spent in the company of Heseltine in 1915:Sometimes Philip and I, on a decrepit motor-cycle, wouldexplore together the neighbouring countryside for old parishchurches and hostelries: the former to sketch, and the latter tosample the local Cotswold brew. Twice we encountered staidfriends of mine on these trips Ö Later we sustained apuncture opposite Marie Corelliís home during a tea-party onthe lawn, which we were promptly invited to join ñ and did.The charming, rather eccentric authoress ofThe Sorrows ofSatan, whom I had previously met professed little love forcontemporary music or musicians. (Goossens 1951, pp. 111-12; cf. also Rosen 1993, p. 45)12Extant letters from Goossens to Heseltine reveal an intense relationshipof shared intimacies:I miss you muchly ñ on your return we must have manyevenings at the Savoyard ñ or elsewhere. Thereís lots I reallywant to talk about ñ as youíre quite the most ëunderstandingíperson where Iím concerned. (Goossens to Heseltine, undatedin Rosen 1993, p. 46)Prior to the summer of 1915, Heseltine had become increasinglyabsorbed in occult matters. His meeting with musician and composerFrederick Delius (1862-1934) in 1911 was to prove significant in relationto this interest, as the latter was experienced in astrology and the castingof horoscopes and was a collaborator onAnatomie et physiologie de líorchestre"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 261(1894) with renowned French occultist Dr GËrard Encausse (1865-1916), better known as ëPapusí (cf. Smith 1996, p. 117). This pamphletplaced the four instrumental groups into a Kabbalistic system thus:strings: God, the head, the nervous system; brass: man, the chest, arterialsystem; woodwinds: woman, the chest, the venous system; percussion:nature, the abdomen, the lymphatic system (cf. Jensen 1994). Althoughin later years Delius made light of his occultism, passing it off as thefolly of youth, Heseltineís biographer writes: ìIt is more than likely thatat some stage he would have discussed his opinions and experiences[on occultism] with the young and impressionable Philipî (Smith 1996,p. 118).Heseltineís friendship with the unorthodox composer Bernard vanDieren (1887-1936), whom he met in 1916, has also been cited as havingan influence on him. Of the latter, Heseltineís son, Nigel, wrote: ìOfhis own Satanism we know little except by inference and analogy. Butwe do know that he captured and held Philipî (Heseltine 1992, p. 81).13Yet Heseltine, by his sonís own admission, already knew Crowley inLondon (c.1914):... it was Aleister Crowley who had the most immediate effectand who no doubt (to quote Augustus John) ëheld me by hisglittering eye as any bore is apt to do,í arousing in Philip acuriosity for the history and practice of magic, which hepursued for several years, and which eventually destroyed him.(Heseltine 1992, p. 75)."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"262 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5Heseltine continued his study of the occult, meeting and striking up afriendship and literary partnership with Neuburg in 1922 after the latterhad ended contact with Crowley.The associations between the occult and music influenced Heseltine,as revealed in the following letter of 22 August 1918 to Colin Taylor(1881-1973):Ö in my view individuals in artistic matters (as elsewhere) arebut tools of certain tendencies and forces.

(Smith 1996, p.155).In view of the fact that 1918 was the year in which Heseltine producedìthe songs that made him,î14the letter to Taylor appears to be anacknowledgement of the power of occult practice in the production ofgreat works.15While Goossensí friendship with both men was more than likelyinfluential on his own belief systems, Salter refers to an earlier fascinationwith the occult: ìEven as a child, Goossens seems to have had an almostcompulsive interest in pagan symbolism. Sidonie remembers the fixationemerging through young Eugeneís talent for drawing: ëWhen he was 11years old, he was doing etchings which were quite beautiful. Littlecaricatures and things. He always loved to draw pictures with gargoyles.He had a sort of mania about gargoyles.í î(Salter 1999, p. 17). As anadult his private reading on witchcraft and related matters were allegedto have disturbed his third wife, Marjorie (cf. Rosen 1993, p. 339). Ifone considers Goossensí musical output there is an additional indicationof his fascination for and familiarity with the occult. According to thefamily biographer, these interests ìhad inspired the magical atmospherehe conjured up in the First Violin Sonata andDon Juan de MaÒara;anextreme sensuality of sound expressed in constantly changingchromaticism and a shimmering orchestral palette.î Rosen continues:ìHis was the world ofFaustandThe Tempest; his search was for thesecret formula that would enable him to reconcile his Catholic conflictbetween desire and conscience and engender perfect harmony betweenbody and mind.î (Rosen 1993, pp. 239-40)."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"264 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5But it wasThe Apocalypse, Goossensí masterwork that best representshis attempts to combine the esoteric, the religious and the occult; it ishis exploration of the musical coalescence of the sacred and the profane.Its world premier was at the Sydney Town Hall on 22 November 1954after some eleven years of contemplation and writing. Based on TheRevelation of St John the Divine, the concluding book of the NewTestament, the opera chronicles the eschatological visions of the saintincluding the deliverance of the New Jerusalem. Rosen posits that theopera even popularised magic for a while: ìSince the performances ofThe Apocalypse, interest in the occult had become far more widespreadamongst the fashionable circles of Sydneyís prominent citizens. A littleindulgence in Pantheism with sexual overtones made a welcome contrastto barbecued ribs on the North Shore or cocktails in Katoomba.î (1993,pp. 364-65).16The LettersThere are eleven extant letters written by Goossens to Norton andGreenlees although one takes the form of instructions in the use of anunguent, which suggests it may have been included in one of the otherletters or in a lost piece of correspondence; one is incomplete with onlypage three intact. Each of the letters extends to approximately two-and-a-half handwritten pages; they had been composed in Australiaand overseas; seven open with a greeting to Norton; four either refer toand / or send greetings to Greenlees (one is actually a postcard fromLord Howe Island addressed to Greenlees);17three are signed withGoossensí magical name, ìDjinnî (discussed below); five includereferences to caution and anonymity; six contain small sketches, two ofwhich are sex magic images (cf. Plate 3 for reproductions of Letters I"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 265and II). The letters are not dated, although one has an intact envelopestamped 4 June 1953 with a Canberra postmark. Another includes aseries of potential meeting times, which suggest four possible dates:March 1952 (too early), August 1953, May 1954 or January 1955. Eachletter deals with magic and sex magic is expressly mentioned in all ofthem, with two particularly lengthy descriptions, which begin thefollowing analysis.In one letter Goossens describes an erotic magical experience with bothNorton and Greenlees:Ö as promised, you came to me early this morning (about1.45) and when a suddenly flapping window blind announcedyour arrival, I realised by a delicious orificial tingling that youwere about to make your presence felt in a very real sense!Seriously you were very definitely here, and you weredoubtless enjoyably aware of what took place.

Astrange hoofed creature was in the room with us ñ upper andmiddle parts female, lower centaur, and a pretty crustaceancreature with large milky breasts also appeared. I will draw itfor you when I see you. All night I was in s.m. delight, and myofferings were, by results, more acceptable to the beings ÖMore of this later.Your description of the triple s.m. rite (you, G. and me) wascurious because I was aware of you both as female (G. always"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"266 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5comes to me as a female,) and I was fully present, also inchanging form.[Letter One]It is evident that Goossens believed in astral travel and it appears thathe understood this occult experience in a similar way to Crowley, namelythat astral travel ìwas conducted within Ö [oneís] own mindî (Owen1997, p. 106). Crowley had perfected astral travel and was in the processof instructing Neuburg in the practice during his sojourn in the desert.What Crowley had experience with, and so too it appears did Goossens,was a form of psychic travel akin to that studied by the Golden Dawn,namely accessing ìAstral Light,î ìseparate planes or orders of existencewhich interpenetrate the world of earthly perceptions.î (Owen 1997,pp. 105-106).18Here we also detect the influence of Norton whoseexperiences (as described above) would have been discussed withGoossens.Earlier in the letter Goossens refers to travelling to Norton via ìaerialcoven,î which establishes an appropriate tone for the description ofpsychic or astral sex magic that follows. Goossens states that prior tothe ìarrivalî of Norton he was preparing to perform the ìosculuminfameî (the obscene kiss) to ìA.î The abbreviation could refer toAsmodeus, named in full in another letter and discussed in some detailby Norton (as quoted previously). As the ìDemon of impurity,îAsmodeus is an appropriate guide to the realms involving sex magicrites. The ìosculum infameî that Goossens was about to administer toìA.î refers to the standard practice accused witches in the early modernEuropean age were believed to perform on the devil, namely the kissingof his anus. Within the rites as practised by the trio, however, the actmay well have been fellatio and cunnilingus. The reference to Nortonís"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 267ìarrivalî and her performance of the same act on Goossens is indicativeof the sex magic they shared. This may be comparable to Crowleyísoffering of himself to Pan (Neuburg): the submission of the self as thenecessary ritual in order for an esoteric experience and subsequentenlightenment to manifest.The reference to Nortonís ìdescription of the triple s.m. rite (you, G.and me),î clearly refers to the trioís shared participation in magical sexon the aforementioned alternate plane. Goossens notes that Nortoníswords were ìcuriousî because he experienced both partners as ìfemale.îThe theme of shared correspondence is a feature of the letters, and theexchange of ideas and events that occurred to each writer during theotherís physical absence is common. In this context, Nortonís descriptionof a rite involving the three of them, in Goossensí physical absence, isindicative of an active communication about sex magic rites. Nortonísnon-extant correspondence, in view of Goossensí response, appears tohave indicated she came to him in both male and female form (note hisreference to ìI was fully present,alsoin changing formî [my italics]).The mutability of both gender (male ìbecomesî female and femaleìbecomesî male) and sexual roles (active becomes passive and vice-versa) is another feature of such rites as R. J. Stewart articulates:In magic the relationships or exchanges made are undeniablysexual; polarised energies are exchanged, entities react withone another. But they are not sexual in the commonlyaccepted illusionary sense of personal gratification, or of thebasic breeding drive that perpetuates the species. Magicalpsychology does not limit sexuality to gender-orientedinteraction; ultimately it emphasises the balanced androgyny"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"268 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5or total being reflected through mankind (Stewart in Hume1997, p. 75).Norton understood the sexual philosophies penned in Goossensí letter.She was aware of (what Stewart refers to as) ìbalanced androgynyîthrough her extensive readings of Jung in particular whose theories onIndividuation she had represented in her artwork, including one of herbest known pieces that bears the Jungian term as its title (cf. Plate 4).Drury writes of the work,Individuation,thatitisìaworkwhichwasintended to demonstrate a universal mystical principle: the cosmic unionof opposites. The title itself presents the key, for ëindividuationí wasJungís term for psychic unity or inner wholenessî (Drury 1988, pp. 121,124; cf. also Jung 1968). As Crowley interpreted the philosophy of theunion of opposites, so did Norton, as this excerpt from one of herjournals reveals:Individuationñ The unified Self which contains all theopposites (such as the conscious and unconscious minds,masculinity and femininity, the animus and the anima etc.) inpolarisation symbolised by the Hermaphrodite figure.Whenever the Hermaphrodite is shown it indicatespolarisation (unity of opposites) and/or equilibrium. (Nortonin Drury 1988, p. 124).In another letter, written on an aeroplane, Goossens refers to ìa pleasantunguentî that he procured from ìone familiar with these thingsî in Parisìwhere they are by no means uncommon.î The instructions on the useof the unguent is described on a single page and written in uppercase. Itreads as follows:"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 2694.

I re-read themagain recently. So far, they merely touch on the future sequelof operations which culminate in what A used to term ìilmagico della s-xî (or what may be referred to as s.m.).

While the words here are somewhat coded, the meaningmay be interpreted as Goossensí desire to be ìmount[ed]î by Norton ina ìs.m.î rite in keeping with his understanding of the term ìDualism.îBasically defined as ìtwofold,î dualism seems to be associated byGoossens with the merging of male/female identities in the context ofsex magic. Crowley interpreted dualism in the context of the ìthreemain principles of the Universe: Dualism, Monism and Nihilism.î (1929[1973], Part III.O). The destruction of Dualism, right and wrong, goodand evil, male and female, was the aim of high magic according toCrowley:Any idea that is thus in itself positive and negative, active andpassive, male and female, is fit to exist above the Abyss; anyidea not so equilibrated is below the Abyss, contains in itselfan unmitigated duality or falsehood, and is to that extentqliphotic and dangerous. (1929 [1973], Part III.VIII.I)On the term ìqliphoticî Crowley writes: ìQliphoth generally suggestthe vice characteristics of the Sephiraî ([1912] 1973, p. 58). The wordliterally means ìhuskî or ìempty shell.îNorton, in recorded psychological records penned by Murphy in 1949,discusses her bisexuality and fantasies of penetrating women. She alsospoke of her encounters with male homosexuals: ìThese men are softand rounded, and they let me do what I like with themî (Norton inDrury 1988, p. 47). Indeed, her understanding of sexual/gender fluidity"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"272 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5is associated with her interpretation of the Jungian concept ofIndividuation.Despite Nortonís public reputation as a witch that has maligned herand cast her as the initiator and malevolent influence on Goossens inthe material to-date, the letters occasionally revealhisrole as the occulteducator. This is best illustrated in a third piece of correspondence:Yes, Iíll instruct you in the grimoire. The diagrams arenecessarily crude but none the less effective, being all fromunimpeachable sources. You will be my best ñ and only ñpupil, and I shall appoint you keeper of the seals. (You nearly/ really[?]hit the nail on the head in your bit about A.C. andself in letter).Unfortunately, I didnít bring the book, but shall bring it nextweek for lesson one.[Letter Three]The composition of a grimoire, a handbook of magic, has an ancienttradition as illustrated by the Greco-Roman material collectively knownas theGreek Magical Papyridiscovered in Egypt in the Nineteenth Centuryand covering a history of beliefs and practices dating from the FirstCentury BCE to the Fifth Century CE. Such manuscript traditions werecontinued during the Early Modern and Renaissance ages. The co-production of the aforementionedGoetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon theKingby Mathers and Crowley in 1904, attributed by them to the legendaryruler, exemplifies the extension of the tradition into the TwentiethCentury. Goossensí reference to the ìgrimoireî appears to define it as apersonal record of the practices that he devised from his own studies"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 273(note the somewhat self-deprecating line: ì[t]he diagrams are necessarilycrude.î The reference to ìA.C.î (Crowley) that immediately follows thediscussion of the grimoire points to him being one of Goossensíìunimpeachable sources.îIn the first letter quoted, there is also attention paid to the creativeoutput of the three practitioners:Tell G Iím thrilled by the conclusion of the H. of U. Itís betterthan I had hoped for!! Also Iím equally thrilled by hisdrawings, which will go in the witch book.[Letter One]This alludes to the planned opera,The Fall of the House of Usher, basedon the short story by Edgar Allan Poe: Goossens would write the musicalscore and Greenless the libretto, while Norton would provide the artisticdesign. It appears that the sex magic had paid off.19On this theme, oneis reminded of Crowleyís mantra (previously quoted) that points to oneof the prime reasons for such practice, namely the attainment ofimaginative, indeed artistic, epiphany that would lead to the productionof master works of illumination. As Urban (2003) writes: ìSex magic,particularly in its transgressive, non-reproductive forms, can thus unleashthe supreme creative power: the power to create not an ordinary fetus,but a magical child of messianic potentialî (p. 166). It was most probablywith this aim in mind that Goossens, a conductor and composer, Norton,an artist, and Greenlees, a poet, combined their magical forces to enhancetheir creative ones.The use of magical names is consistent throughout the letters.

Thedjinniwere created fromthe flame of a smokeless fire (Koran 15:27), and it was believed theycould be summoned by an Arab magician (muqqrribun) to attainknowledge and acquire power. According to the Islamic scholar IbnTaimiyah (b.1263 CE), thedjinnialso possessed humans, notably thoseinclined to be wrongdoers, those who indulge in lust, and interestingly,musicians (cf. al-Ashqar). In Arab myth they were also associated withinspiring artistic powers, again through possession or madness. Crowleyalso mentions thedjinniand refers to them as beings an adept magicianis able to summon and as forces able to copulate with humans, whichaligns them to incubi, vampires, and similar sexual entities.Magical practices performed by Goossens independently of Norton andGreenless are also noted, including a reference to his experiment withCrowleyís Cakes of Light:I LEFT THE SECONDHAND COPY OF THE ìG.B.îPROPPED AGAINST YOUR DOOR, AND HOPE YOUFOUND IT SAFELY THERE ON YOUR RETURN.

Thebook referred to may be John Symondsí biography of Crowley,The GreatBeast: The Life of Aleister Crowley, which was released in 1951.The Cakes of Light were a delicacy of Crowleyís, and a recipe wasincluded inLiber Al vel Legis:24 For perfume mix meal & honey & thick leavings of redwine: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften& smooth down with rich fresh blood.25 The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the freshblood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then ofenemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of somebeast, no matter what.26 This burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me.

(III)Crowley intended the cakes to be used in the ìMass of the Phoenix Ömixed with the blood of the Magusî (1929 [1973], Part III.XX.I). TheCake or Eucharist, consumed daily, enabled a magus to replace matterwith spirit, the human with the divine, thereby becoming capable ofany task.

The accounts of sexmagic within the realms of astral planes are juxtaposed to everydayobservations, updates on Goossensí travels, and requests for updatesfrom Norton, such as the enquiry concerning her cat, Gray, whoapparently went missing[Letter One]. Amid these commonplacesnippets are some fascinating pieces of information, which concludethis analysis.Goossens reveals his contact with Heseltine in one brief note, clearlyin response to an inquiry by Norton:Yes I knew P.H. in both phases:- remind me to tell you aboutour doings together![Letter Five]The reference to ìboth phasesî may indicate his friendship with PhilipHeseltineandPeter Warlock, while the allusion to ìour doings together!îsuggests several possibilities: their time in the summer of 1905, a same-sex relationship, and / or the practice of magic together. As lovers ofmusic, particularly the classical repertoire as the reference to ìP.H.îindicates, Norton and Greenless had yet another passion to share withthe conductor and composer. Goossens in fact, as several letters show,invited them to dress rehearsals and performances and Norton ìwasoften to be seen on guest tickets at his concerts in the Town Hall.î(Rosen 1993, p. 341).Goossens also reveals the extent of the friendship with the pair, whichinvolved the exchange of family histories and anecdotes. For example,Goossens refers to the family nickname for him, Zenny (Rosen 1993, p."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 277119), which in reference to Nortonís slight lisp in its pronunciation,entices him:I see your argument about changing over from Djinn, butanonymity is still best served by sticking to it Ö than themore familiar family name. Yet let it serve you in our privatespeech, if you will, but never in written. It would soundwonderful from your little tongue ñ the hiss of the Z would beintoxicatingly perverse.[Letter Six]He writes of his acquaintance with Yusapov, the Russiannoble who killed Rasputin[Letter Seven], his love of castles[Letter Seven]and his delight in Nortonís gift of theinfamousBlack Magicpainting[Letter Five].It seems superfluous to note that the activities of Goossens, Norton,and Greenlees were decidedly against the normative sexual practicesand values of Australia during the 1950s, a reality not lost on Goossens:And how I agree with you about all that normality ìpapî!

It would beintolerable if the conventional set-up of ìsocial sexî fastenedeven a shadow on our transpirings ñ of all kinds!![LetterSeven]Despite this defiant tone, Goossens consistently pleads that all thecorrespondence be destroyed. Homosexuality or more specificallysodomy was illegal20and the 1950s saw ìthe sharp increase in the numberof people charged and convicted for what was officially labelledunnatural offencesî (Willett 2000, p. 10). This increase was a result of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"278 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5the intensification of policing ordained at ìthe highest levelî (Willett2000, p. 10). The New South Wales Commissioner of Police at the timeof Goossensí apprehension at Mascot Airport, C. J. Delaney, was acommitted campaigner against homosexuality, ìcalling it in 1958 ëthegreatest social menaceí facing Australiaî (Willett 2000, p. 10). Delaneyísrhetoric is in keeping with that ìdirected against homosexuality duringthe Cold Warî that connected it with ìdisease, decadence or securityriskî (Murphy 2000, p. 62). While gays and lesbians were obviously apresence during the 1950s, they were an invisible and silent one,represented in the meagre media coverage usually in the context ofcourt cases concerning sexual misconduct. In this environment the sexualrelations between Goossens and Greenlees, which a more sophisticatedreading would reject as equating to homosexuality, were against themale hegemony that characterised Australian society, culture, and sexualmores at this time.Bisexuality was, like sex magic, unfamiliar to the average Australian.Indeed the very concept of sex magic was almost unheard of, and whenNorton was covered in the newspapers of the day, her beliefs and artwere not only regarded as Satanic but also perverted and pornographic.Nortonís individuality and personal independence ñ let alone her sexualityñ were also at odds with the traditional female role that was essentiallyconfined to the idealized image of the homemaker or the ìcareerî nurturersuch as teacher or nurse. The expression of female sexuality was notabsent or necessarily repressed in the 1950s, but it was predominantlyconfined to marriage and marriage that was preferably sanctioned bythe Christian Church.

In this context, Norton, an artist, bohemian,divorcee and witch who lived intermittently with a male who was, forall intents and purposes, identified as homosexual, was the antithesisof the widely held stereotypical image of ìwoman.î Such an image ofNorton was consistent in the multifarious reports on her in the printmedia as summarised in the memoirs of crime reporter Bill Jenkings(1992):Iíd encountered her on many occasions and I reckoned she wason the lowest rung of humanity. She was the epitome ofdepravity, but she must have had some sort of diabolicalcharm, because she had a large circle of devoted worshippersaround her. Norton was a self-styled high priestess of blackmagic, who led a coven of witches and warlocks in thebohemian Kings Cross area. She exuded evil ñ I used to feellike sprinkling holy water whenever I was in her presence. (pp221-22)Jenkings was at the airport the day Goossens was arrested (his memoirsalso detail this event), and while his words may strike the modern readeras hyperbolic, they do encapsulate the mediaís representation of Nortonduring the late 1940s and 1950s. One is here reminded of the similarreception of Crowley, particularly in the English press, the mostinfamous description of him as ìthe wickedest man in the world,î asdescribed in LondonísJohn Bullmagazine on 24 March 1923."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"280 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5Goossensí letters to Norton and Greenlees speak of sex magic but ofmany other things besides. Contained herein is a documented friendshipbetween three practitioners that broke social and class barriers not onlyin the pursuit of sex magic but of the achievements it promised.Goossens came to Australia as a prominent musician and composerwith a world reputation. He also came as an experienced occultist whofound in Norton and Greenlees a partnership of equals, two individualswho could match his knowledge and were prepared to explore thepossibilities of artistic genius. The rituals never reached the ultimateaims the practitioners sought; potential rites were unrealised andTheFall of the House of Usherremained unfinished. After Goossensí publichumiliation in1956 and his subsequent return to England, the lettersstopped.21Notes1Copies of the letters came into my possession through contact withfilmmaker Geoff Burton in 2003. Burton obtained copies fromTrevenar during a series of interviews with him for the documentaryentitledFall of the House.As the letters are now in the public domainand the incorporation herein is selective, the use of them is regardedas fair dealing.

The venue,then the only performance space for drama students at this smallcampus, a satellite of The University of Newcastle, was closed severalyears ago owing to its state of ill-repair. The production was stagedfor three nights and had full-capacity crowds in its small space (seatingroughly 60 people) - a triumph considering the cold winter nights andthe demography of the region (albeit most of the attendees wereconnected to the university in some capacity).3Burtonís film was first screened at the Sydney Film Festival on Sunday20 June 2004. The ABC (Australian Broadcasting Commission)documentary ìSir Eugene Goossens: Sex, Magic and the Maestroîaired on Sunday 5 September 2004 onRewind.4Pamela Main, Goossensí companion in later years and the beneficiaryof a will he wrote 11 days before his death, threatened legal action.No official proceedings eventuated.5Prior to the work of Aleister Crowley, Paschal Beverly Randolf (alsospelt ìRandolphî) (1825-1875) developed and practised a form ofsex magic (cf. Deveney 1996). In addition to Randolf, Karl Kellner(originator) and Karl Theodor Reuss (founder) of theOrdo TempliOrientis(O.T.O) organized initiations (the seventh, eighth and ninthdegrees), based on sex magic.6Cf. Drury (1988, pp. 136-37) and Richmond (2000, p. 2). Druryconcludes: ìRosaleenís main occult sources, books one could actuallyuse, were the occult manuals prepared by writers like Dion Fortuneand Aleister Crowleyî (p. 137)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"282 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 57Interestingly, Drury has claimed: ìAs far as we know, Rosaleenreceived no reply to her letterî (p. 80). There was, in fact, a reply,which as been preserved in a private collection. Lewisí reply is rathershort, distanced and clearly intended to curb any furthercorrespondence Norton may have been contemplating.8As a result of the book, Wally Glover was charged with producing anobscene publication and appeared at Central Court on 25 November1952. The prosecutor Mr D. J. Vine-Hall singled outBlack Magic,Esoteric StudyandIndividuationas particularly offensive. Glover wasfound guilty and fined £5 plus costs. Two works from the book,FohatandThe Adversary, were blacked out in remaining copies; forrelated details on the Post Office and Customs ban, cf. Drury (1988)and Coleman (1962, pp. 58-59). In September 1955Black Magicwasexhibited at the Kashmir Cafe, Macleay Street, Potts Point. Themanager of the establishment, David Goodman, was charged withìa breach of the Obscene and Indecent Publications Actî and in theensuing court case, Mr Dash SM describedBlack Magic,BeelzebubandBelphagorthus: ìI deem that all three pictures emphasise matters of sexunduly and as tending to corrupt the morals of unsophisticatedmembers of the general public, and, in consequence, they areobscene.îBlack Magicwas further described by Dash as ìlewd, lustfuland erotic.î (Anonymous 1955, p. 45). Goodman was found guiltyand fined £5 plus costs (cf. also Drury 1994).9In November 1916, Heseltine published an article on Goossensíchamber music inThe Music Student, which marked the first usage ofHeseltineís pseudonym, Philip Warlock. Heseltine wrote to Goossensexplaining that ìfor very important reasonsî he had to conceal hisidentity from the editor of the journal, Walter Wilson Cobbett (cf.Smith 1996, p. 103). While it is unwise to accredit too muchsignificance to what may be a coincidence, this nevertheless may pointto a mutual understanding and sharing of occult beliefs that haddeveloped during the previous summer.10 Cf. also, Scott (1969) where he discusses his friendship with PercyGrainger (1882-1960), also a friend of Goossens. Grainger was avirtuoso pianist and innovative composer as well as a sexualadventurer (cf. Bird 1976). He and his wife Ella were among"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Issue 5 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 283Goossensí few supporters during the crisis of 1956 (cf. Rosen 1993,p. 361).11 One of the positive results of Goossensí return to England was hisrenewed closeness with Scott. When Goossens died, Rosen (1993, p.387) reports that Scott telephoned his sister Sidonie and offered thefollowing condolences: ëìItís all right. Eugeneís with Percy Graingeron the other side and theyíve already formed their own orchestra!îí12 This summer of 1915 was not in its entirety as idyllic as Goossensrecalls; cf. Smith 71-73. Novelist Jean Rhys (1890-1979) recorded theholiday in her short story ëTill September Petronella;í cf. Rhys 1960[1987].13 It is noteworthy that Nigel Heseltine equates magic with Satanism andhis intense dislike for the occult is evident throughout this account ofhis fatherís life.14 Taylor (cited in Smith 1996, p. 154). Taylor, Heseltineís piano teacherat Eton, remained a mentor and friend throughout his life.15 Smith (1996, p. 154) also suggests the influence of the medium HesterDowden at this time.16 Rosenís reference to the North Shore is to the Goossensí residence atWahroonga, a most well-appointed locale, and to Goossensíìgetawayî in Katoomba in the Blue Mountains some 100 km N-Wof Sydney. Goossens refers to his cottage in Mount Victoria in theBlue Mountains in Letter 3 and provides Norton with directions forgetting there, writing: ìObviously a pied-‡-terre is necessary, hiddenand private Öî17 Lord Howe Island, off Australiaís east coast, is the closest islandresort to Sydney.18 Cf. Crowley,MagickPart III.XVIII. Fortuneís system was also inkeeping with Crowleyís; cf. Fortune (1935, pp. 180-81).19 As noted by Rosen (1993, p. 341), there were sketches forThe Houseof Usherfound among Goossensí papers after his death, but thesewere for a ballet not an opera.20 Australia had inherited its sodomy laws from the United Kingdomthrough colonization. During the Nineteenth Century, these laws were"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"284 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 5maintained in the criminal codes of colonial parliaments, and by thestate parliaments in the post-Federation era. In response to theWolfden Report in Britain (1957) that initiated change to the SexualOffences Act (1967), the Dunstan government of South Australiaintroduced its ìconsenting adults in privateî defence in 1972 andrepealed the stateís sodomy law in 1975. Between 1976 and 1990,with the exception of Tasmania, the other states and territoriesrepealed the sodomy law.
