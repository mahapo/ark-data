[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 155The Human Body inSouthern Slavic FolkSorceryAndrija Filipovic and Anne M. RaderIn many charms, as in other rites, we often express a need to know withwhat part of the body one should commit a certain action: do we spiton the fourth finger of the left hand, do we touch something with a heelof the left foot, or cut hair from the back of the head? I have found withinSlavonic sorcery that there is a principle of systematization that with itsdiscrete rules does or doesn’t allow communication of what we will. Theinstigation of will can be determined by a set of rules. These rules rise aboveone’s will and function as rules of use, as rules of verbal language-of will.In magical-religious texts, the body is not usually seen as a biologicalorganization comprised of organs with specific functions, but above all it isseen as a spacious organized whole, with it’s parts having a certain symbolicmeaning. Thus, certain parts of the body become signs by which mythiccontents are expressed.The view we hold, based upon the above parameters allows a creation ofanalogies between the human body and other forms of the real world. Thismeans that man, in his creation of the model of the world that surroundshim, puts forth his body as a measure of the universe. When bringing in the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"156 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2connection of the human body and universe, we create a base for the creationof cosmogonical myths, in which the body of the mythic hero, the FirstHuman, gives birth to the universe. In the Upanishads, the cosmos is createdfrom the parts of the body of Purusha: - from his mouth exited words; fromhis eyes came light, from light sun was made; from ears, the ability to hear,from this ability came the cardinal directions; from his skin grew hair, fromhair plants were created; from heart came spirit, from spirit the moon wasmade; from the navel came apana, from apana – death; from his phallusflowed sperm, from sperm, was water created. In ancient India, theybelieved Purusha was a synonym for human.Visantians interpreted the name of Adam as an abbreviation (ADAM),created of the Greek first letters in the words for East, West, North andSouth, concluding that man is a little universe (microcosm). In an apocryphalmanuscript from Bosnia, “Skazanije popa Ilije Ilica”, the creation ofhumankind is considered God’s work; all was created of parts of the universe.God created body from earth, eyes of the sea, blood from dew, mind fromclouds, strength from wind, bones of stone, hair of grass, spirit of theHoly Ghost.1Formation of the symbolic picture of the human body is based on a series ofbinary oppositions, which are present in the texts of traditional culture as anoperative aspect of mythic thinking, as I will explore in this article.Naked – ClothedImmediately after the birth of a baby, the child is considered to be on theborder between culture and nature, and that is why it is not dressed butswaddled. The previously worn shirts of the mother or father are usuallyused for the first swaddling. This way, the marginal status of the child in thefamily is bridged. The swaddled child is not the same as the dressed, becausethe diaper wraps around the body, making it an undivided whole, and thecloth is sewn by the measure of the child’s body. Until the baptism, the childis called goljca, golco, kuslja (meaning naked little thing), emphasizing hisor her different status in his relationship to other people. Upon his/her baptism,the baby gets their name from their godfather and their shirt from theirgodmother, and with that, he or she is initiated from nature into culture."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 157One’s name and clothes are seen as a measure of a human being and that iswhy they may be hidden when there is danger from malevolent spirits.Because the opposite of the human world from the wild can be seen as anopposite between clothed and unclothed (naked) in terms of magicalcommunication, where the direct contact of human with demonical beings isrequested, man has to be unclothed when participating in magical rites. InBulgarian history, men who “banished” the dragon from their village werenaked. Also, among the Serbs, the blacksmith and his wife made tiny toolsof iron, naked, at midnight, for magical protection.Body-SoulThe idea that humans consist of body and soul is present in Slavic, as inmany othercultures across the world. After the death of the body, the soul leaves it andgoes to the other world and the body decays. The relationship between thesoul and body can be seen in dichotomies: inside/out, permanent/changeable,invisible/visible.Among southern Slavic nations, the belief that the soul of some people canleave the body and return to it after some time is very widespread. Accordingto this belief, such leave-taking can happen during the night at a specifichour. The people who have the power to do this usually have demoniccharacteristic, according to folklore, and they are theenemies of humankind, called witches, or mora. But, they can also workfor the benefit of the human race, such as the Zdhuaci, for example, whofight against the daemons of hail clouds. As a proof of the folk belief thatsome people with demonic characteristics can separate the body and soul,many people will testify to how they have seen how a witch can be stoppedfrom Macva-separating her soul from her body. During the day, they say, ifone suspects that a woman is a witch, a needle with a red string should bethrust in her shadow in the area of the head. If a woman is truly a witch, it isbelieved that she can’t move from that place until sunset.2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"158 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2There is a less-known traditional understanding of the soul leaving its body.In the Serbian-Bulgarian-Macedonian tradition of spellcrafting, a very archaic form ofmagical behavior has survived, in which the cunning man or women banishesa demonic force with her/his soul.3 This is done with a movement of themouth-a yawn. That is why cunning-folk yawn during a healing ritual. If thecunning woman doesn’t feel like yawning, she hasn’t found any disease. Insome charms involving children, a cunning man or woman may threatendemonic forces with the soul of a child’s mother.Everyday people cannot cast spells for themselves, only cunning folk cando it for them, often older women, among Serbs called bajalice, Croatiansin Herzegovina - mole and lice, in Kotari in Dalmatia - vidigoje, inMacedonia - basmarici, bajalici, bajaljki, in Bulgaria - bajacki, basmarki,in Slovenia - zagovarjalki, Russia - zagovoscici, etc.4 Those who can doharm with spells are called in Serbia - vracarice, vrazalice, cinjarice,Monte Negro - madjionice, carovnice, Croatia - coprnice, Russia -koldunje.5 Knowledge of spellcrafting is transmitted only within the family,from elders to young, and according to this tradition , a young cunningwoman begins working only after the old one stops. There are commonways of transmission of spellcrafting knowledge (in some cases bajalicetransmit knowledge before puberty; in Bulgaria the old bajalica spits in themouth of young one.) According to sayings of some cunning-folk, they havestarted to cast spells after the order of God’s Mother, St. Petka, faeries,etc. which have come to them in dreams or during long illness and havediscovered their ways of spellcraft. In some areas (eastern Serbia, Banat,western Herzegovina), a cunning woman, during a spell, falls into somekind of altered state of consciousness – a very sleepy trance-like state,losing consciousness. From this it is traditionally believed that, her soul,while in such state, is fighting with a demon of disease or visiting the faeriesasking them for the return of health to the ill person. A Cunning woman hasthe obligation to keep a secret of spellcrafting and to always say any verbalpart of spell correctly even if she sometimes does not understand it. Spell(“basma”) is understood as an “instrument” of a special kind, which carriespower since the Old Times and which assignment is to return balance. A"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 159Cunning woman often does it in a symbolical way, creating some kind ofparallel model, in which existing conditions, using specific magical procedures,translate into another - wanted state. According to assignation, spells canbe sorted into spells for medical, economic and social life. As for the structure,spells can take the form of established phrases, prayers, beseeching or adeveloped, more complex, scheme.6 For every occasion a unique spellexists but, in some cases, the text of one spell can be modified to suit adifferent need, with the cunning woman simply improvising. Duringspellcrafting, bajalica uses some tools, which have magical functions. Theycan be part of the non-verbal message of the spell - on one level, and onanother – an illustration of cunning woman’s intention (usually expressed inthe form of a threat). The first group consists of: salt, eggs, flour, objectsconnected to fire, dead-man’s things, parts of some animals and plants. Thesecond group consists of: sharp tools (knife, axe, thorn, spindle), objectswith strong smells (garlic, incense), cleaning tools (broom). Commonly, partof casting spells is the unusual behavior of participants. This behavior is, insome way, different than every-day, normal behavior. It is characterized byinverted behavior , such as silence, taking off clothes, spitting or swearing.Dragging some objects through a hollow tree, or their measuring has animportant role in magical casting. Spells are cast in specific time and specificplace, some cast during full, some during waxing moon. The day of theweek is of some importance (very often spells are cast on Wednesday,Friday and Sunday); time of day (often some borderline time of day ischosen - morning just before sunrise, and night immediately after sunset,however some spells are cast in the middle of the night). Special markedplaces with some kind of ritual importance are often chosen for spell casting.Such places represent the boundary between common and alien space,starting from fireplace, doorstep, roof, fence, etc. Borderline places betweenland and water can be used as places for spellcrafting (wells, rivers, springs,watermill, bridge). “Unclean” places such are pig stys and graveyards arealso used. Places with some kind of vertical line constantly present (chimney,standing stones, trees) are used for such activities too. In some instanceSlavic ways of spellcrafting have been influenced by written magical literature(apocryphal prayers, curses, magical formulas). There are three lines of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"160 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2influence: Visantian (via Greek language), Roman-Germanic (via Latin andGerman) with only a little influence from Turkish, Arabian, Islamic sources.The most archaic form of spell craft is present among Slavs in the Balkan-Carpathian area and in Northern Russia.Horizontal Division of the BodyThe body is divided into three parts horizontally: – head, chest and legs.There are many forms of magical healing which work using this system. InMacedonia, to heal irrational fear among children, a cunning woman placesnine horseshoes near the head, chest and then knees. In Levca and Temnic,the cunning woman “replaces a cock for a man”, for the magical healing ofepilepsy. A midwife does this when the epileptic falls asleep. She will tearoff the head of a young black cock that hasn’t sung yet and bury the cock’shead beneath the epileptic’s head, while the body of the cock with thewings is buried beneath the epileptic’s waist, and the cock’s legs are buriedbeneath the epileptic’s legs.7Waist-BeltThe symbolic view of the human is usually based upon the clothed man.Clothing in traditional Slavic culture holds an importance for the belt, whichseparates the body into two parts: – the upper (clean) and lower (unclean)half. Because of this separation, the belt has a very important meaning; itbecomes a medial element, which brings together two opposites. From thisidea originates the very important role of the waist-belt in Slavic magictradition. The cultural idea of girding one’s waist has become a key elementof cosmological Slavic myth, within which people believe that there is aworld above us and underneath us. Those who live above us put the belt onjust below their armpits, and those beneath us, put the belt around theirthighs. But we, since we are in the middle world, gird our waists.8Among simple folk in Russia in the 19th century, the belt was considered asacred object because it was gifted upon baptism. It was considered rudeif one prayed to God, ate and slept without the belt. In Herzegovina therestill exists the custom of burying a child who has died with a belt around its"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 161waist. It is believed that if the child is buried without the belt, it couldn’thave anything of its own in the other world.9Because the belt is a boundary between two opposite principles, it has avery important role in magical practice. In eastern Serbia, if one wants to beprotected from bullets, one must shoot down a piece of mistletoe from atree and sew its twigs into one’s belt.10 In Bosnia, a child who cries a lot isthought to be cursed. The cursed child’s waist is girded with a string wovenwith four colors – red, yellow, black and orange.11 As a protection fromnight demons, known as mora, people put a belt over themselves duringthe night. When a domacin, who is a large property owner, suspects thatthere is cuma (an evil night spirit) in the village, he orders everyone to takeoff their belts, tie them together, and wrap them all around the houses. InMacedonia, for protection of the whole village, twin brothers till the groundaround the village with a plough and twin oxen.With the girdling of one’s waist the opposition of up/down, clean/unclean,human/inhuman, is neutralized and thus, the possibility of conflict withmalevolent spirits is neutralized too. For the same reason, Montenegrosgirdled their waists with a belt when they walked through the cemeteriesand let it drag behind them.12 People from Serbia, Bosnia and Macedoniathink that if they approach a wolf, they should unbuckle their belt and theywill surely save their lives. Other than the neutralization of the above saidopposites, this custom makes the human himself a zoomorphic being, becausethe belt is used as a tail, and with it trailing behind, the difference betweenhuman and animal is negated.The belt is also a horizontal axis and because of that it can take attributesfrom the female paradigm. The belt, together with a vertical axis; i.e. theheight of a woman, creates a cross which point of intersection is the navel.Because of that, a belt is used in magical actions connected to giving birth.Encircling a man, the belt is his measure too, and in archaic texts a man’smeasure can replace a real human. For example, if a man to whom Fatessend illness cannot go to a doctor or nurse, he sends his belt.13 In Kosovo,the rainbow is called “the belt” and it is thought that if one passes underneath"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"162 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2it, s/he will change into the opposite sex: male will become female and viceversa.14The LegsThe symbolic function of the legs is usually based on their connection toearth. A very important element is that they are seen as an ending of thebody, since the head is the body’s beginning. Because of that, a charmbegins from the head, gradually banishing illness into the legs and from there– out of the body:“Bezi urok iz glave na prsa,“The curse runs from the head into the chest,iz prsa na trbu,from the chest into the belly,iz trbua na bedra,from the belly into the thighs,iz bedra na tabane...”from the thighs into the soles...”There is a belief that above the head of a dying man, there is a guardianangel and below his feet, the devil, and each of them calls his soul.16 Theattack of malevolent beings usually begins from the legs. Here is a descriptionof an attack of the night demon, mora from Herzegovina:“First, beginning from the toes on the left foot, a man feels somevery heavy presence there: - something is pulling the toe and hefeels it climbing on the leg; it feels like a huge stone falling on theleg. From the leg it goes into the stomach and, then, into thechest.”17Knees, heels, sock and shoes are also very important in magical actions.When people suspect that a strong wind is caused by the devil, they say:“Under the left knee!”18 to banish the wind. In Bosnia, people believe thatthey can see witches if they, during the Easter dinner, spit the first bite of thedinner in the hand and look around. They believe that then they may seewitches flying around glowing like sparks.19 In Slavonia, some believe that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 163if an old woman falls, it is because a male witch hit her in the knee.20 Thereare many charms that use the touch of the heel for healing. The curses usingthe heel are usually used to cure diseases connected to the stomach. Themost powerful heel is the one with which a cunning woman or man haskilled a snake. The connection between shoes and the abundance of theearth can be seen in some Christmas customs – on Christmas Eve everyonetake their shoes off before they go to bed so the crops grow evenly.21 Toprotect oneself from spells, one should wear one red and one green sock.22Vertical DivisionLeft and RightOf all the opposites of the body, the most noticed one is the one concerningthe left and the right side of the body. The right side is seen as a good,favorable, positive and as a male side; the left is marked as bad, unfavorable,negative, and a female side. Because of the communication with an uncleanforce, which goes with the same paradigm as the left side, spells are oftencast with the left arm. “The left arm doesn’t hold a cross”, is a commonexpression in charms. For enhancing the powers, a cunning man would,when he sees the first snail in the spring, touch his head with the fourth fingeron the left hand and say: “Whatever you are, go back!”Front side  Back side of the BodyIn spell crafting and divination, the front side of the body has these attributes– mine, human, and favorable, while the backside of the body is connectedto the alien and inhuman.For better communication with the spirit world, elements from the backsideof the body are used: for an example, a sick man is wiped with the backsideof his shirt. In love magic, cookies are made with water that has been trickleddown one’s spine and has been collected on one’s bottom.23 In the makingof an amulet against ill luck, the hair from the backside of the head is used.The opposite front/back side of the body can be translated into the wideropposition of forward/backward (going backwards, spitting over the leftshoulder while doing the spell).24"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"164 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2Center – Periphery of the BodyHair and NailsIn folk magic, the nails and the hair are often used; sometimes hair from thebeard and eyelashes too. All these elements can be sorted into peripheralopposition. The hair and the nails symbolize continuous birth and dying(expressed through constant growth and cutting) and through this, the symbolof perpetual change is expressed which is the goal of cunning-folk.The hair is associated with the negative principle and the chthonic world.Because of that, there is a belief that one should not throw his hair into thewater or else it will turn into snakes.25 Among Serbs, after a death there isa custom that men must go without hats until the deceased is buried. Afterthe burial ceremony they do not shave for 3 or 7 days.The hair, like the nails, according to the pars pro toto principle, can be asubstitute for humans. In a spell to cause a man’s death, one has to takesome of his hair, three nails from his toes and three from his fingers, a pieceof his clothes and all is put into a rag doll made of the man’s clothing andburied in the grave of an anonymous person.26In charms, when an illness returns to a person, first, the cunning woman orman will hit him/her in the nails, then joints, body and head (from theperiphery toward the center), and when the illness is banished from theperson: - then it goes from the brain into the bones, from the bones intothe flesh, from the flesh into the skin, from the skin into the hair, andfrom the hair into the grass (from the center toward the periphery).27Almost identical practices can be found among Germans: “A Germanadjuration addressed to a worm enjoins it to “go out” from the patient’smarrow into his veins, then from his veins into his flesh, and so forth until isoutside the body altogether.”28The picture of the world that surrounds humans is created by the sameprocess of thoughts, which are also used for observance of one’s own bodyand its situation in that same world. The key for understanding the world inmytho-poetic text is created on the perception of the human body and its"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 165status in the world space. The body becomes the heuristic model for theunderstanding of the cosmos.The VoiceThe Voice and the LightThe voice has had a very important role in the history of the Slavic culture.In cosmogonical myths, the voice is the beginning of the creation of theuniverse, because the light and the voice are opposites of the dark andsilence. The first sign that a newborn baby has come into this world is itsvoice; and the first sound it hears is its voice. The voice separates it from thedark womb, but it leads it into the coldness of the world and risk. And later,as an adult, when this world threatens him or her in any period of his life,when it makes him or her incapable of dealing with hard situations, s/heraises their voice – in screams, cries, and pleadings. By spellcrafting; i.e.with the help of the words; that is the voice, the disturbance of the order inlife, which is threatening to humans, is removed.Among Slavs who live on the Balkans, the verbal part of the charm is called“basma”. This word is of ancient Slavic origin and its root is *bha-, whichforms two major groups of words – one with the meaning “to speak”, andthe second “to light”.29 Independent of the hypothesis of semanticconnections of these two verbs; in charms there are two opposite paradigms– the first are the light and the speaking (the sound) and the second is thedark and the silence. The first paradigm is attributed to humans and theirsocial space, and the second – the wilderness and the chthonic world.30In formulas for banishing unclean forces, the places to which those forcesare sent are described as dark and where no voice can reach them (thevoice of the rooster, the bell and the sound of an axe hitting the tree, mostoften).31 During contact with such beings, accidental or otherwise, the personis obliged to be silent or else she can be severely hurt.The spirit forces such as ala, werewolves, witches, and devils, are believedto endanger even the main sources of light – the Sun and the Moon. That iswhen there is an eclipse. People defend themselves during an eclipse with"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"166 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2shouting, ringing bells, hitting pots and other things, or else completedarkness would reign.32The Whispering and the SingingCharms are often realized in vocal form, and, according to the rule, in aspecial vocal way. The most often way is whispering. Among Poles, thecunning woman lowers her head and very quietly whispers the charm. Thisway of spellcrafting was present even among ancient Assyrians and amongother nations also; for example, the Hebrews. The whispering has a symbolicfunction. It can be seen as a spirit speaking i.e. the cunning woman is “aninstrument”, transmitter of an entity’s language/speaking. In other words,she is “the gateway” through which, by speaking, a super-human forcetravels. It is enough for her to make contact with the power, which helpsher, and to mark the cause of action. She describes the present situation,names the diseases, etc. in the charm. The helping power is often the ChristianGod, but among the Serbs the older system has survived and besides God,the helpers may be the Virgin Mary, and fairies who are like sisters to thecunning women.There are other forms of spellcrafting also. In southern Serbia, some cunning-folk speak their charm in a monotone or even voice, which sounds morelike singing than speaking. They fall into trance and, through the song, saythe cure for the ill person. Some of them, after coming into the usual state ofconsciousness, cannot remember what they said while singing.33 Somecunning-folk call for the help of their sister fairies, or even the soul of adrowned person.34Here is an example of the concept of a charm having supernatural powers.This is the charm against the bite of poisonous snakes and it comes fromMacedonia. As a charm, the song heard in a dream is used. Beforespellcrafting, the person says: “My rooster lays the red eggs.”35 With thisanti-behavior, the “upside down” model of the world is created, which shouldbring the neutralization of the human-snake’s poison to a position ofopposition, where the snake’s poison is seen as an unclean spirit from thewild space."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 167Based upon the above listed examples, cunning-folks’ singing and whisperingcan be connected because both transcend the simple, one-sided function ofspeaking as a social act, extending the possibility of communication withbeings outside of the human world. The only difference is that one form“lowers below” the normal speaking (the whispering), and the second “risesabove” it (the singing). Both forms demand a special emotional state (ecstasyor deep gravity. Among southern Slavs there are traces of the cunning-folkfalling into trance similar to shamanistic journeying while whispering. In suchforms of healing, the voice and tears have special symbolical meaning.The Voice and the SoulIn a description of a charm against a curse, the cunning woman starts toyawn and tears start to drop from her eyes if she finds the disease she hasbeen looking for. In Herzegovina, a cunning woman falls into a feverishstate, sweats and bursts into tears. Sometimes even foam starts to fall fromher mouth and cascades to the ground.36 The usual rule is that the cunningwoman speaks the charm with untied hair or, as among Vlahs in easternSerbia, she is completely nude.37 If this picture of a cunning woman is incontrast to the picture of some female mythological beings that cause diseaseslike the forest or mountain mothers and babice, one can see some strikingsimilarities, also. These creatures are often depicted in the state of extremerage and anger, with wide-open eyes and bared teeth. By sometimes bringingthemselves into a special state of fury, cunning women take the “wild” uponthemselves as the most convenient way to deal with the malevolent spiritforce. In some charms, there are traces, which show that the cunning womanfights against the unclean force with her own soul, because of that, sheconstantly yawns and speaks the whole charm with the “whole voice”, i.e.without a pause. Numerous examples show that the voice is seen as anouter manifestation of the spellcrafter’s soul, which hunts down demonslike a hunting dog.The Voice and the Tears as the Axis MundiThere are specific type of charms spread over the central Balkans amongthe Slavic population and partially among the Vlahs, which can be called“the story about suffering and healing of a man”.38 According to the contents,it can be divided into several groups."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"168 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2The first group includes the charms against infected wounds, inflicted bysharp objects accidentally. These charms are present in eastern Serbia andwestern Bulgaria. They are formed by this model:1. The person goes outdoors to collect herbs and hurts him/herself on some sharp object;2. The wound gets infected and the person starts to crybecause of the strong pain;3. His/her voice goes high, up into the sky and the Virgin Maryhears it and asks about his/her trouble;4. After the person repeats his/her story, the Virgin Marysoothes his/her pain and promises that a cunning man orwoman will show up and ease the trouble.The sharp objects are plants like Dispacus silvester, Genistra germanica,Hawthorn ( Crataegus sp.). and things like the bone of the snake, the toothof the wolf, the claw of an eagle, etc. These plants and parts of the animalshave special magical function in other charms and magical rituals too.The second group consists of charms, which differ from the first group bythe cause of disease; in this group, the disease is caused by a malevolentspirit force on which a person stumbles upon in the field. Because of that,the circle of diseases is much bigger, and so is the action of the charms.Dangerous beings, which cause illness, are named thus: ala, babice, thethree headed snake, and fairies. The sick man will also cry and his prayersare answered by his patron saint or even Christ.39Except for the permanent structure, there is an archaic formula tied to thevoice and the tears in these charms. The Virgin Mary or the saints help thesuffering person only when she “screams up to the sky, and cries down tothe earth”. With this formula the symbolic union between the sky and theearth is created: - the endangered person builds up the cosmic axis, whichmeans an expression of a need for correction of disturbed order. The creationof an axis means the bringing to life, the sacred time of the beginning, that isan archaic order in which everything has had its steady place and where nohuman being has been threatened by beings from an alien world. There is"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 169another level of symbolism here too: the axis is built up by real things, whichare also the attributes of the Thunderer (the voice) and Mother Earth (thetears, moist). It is interesting that in some charms, the cosmic axis issymbolically created by the voice of a rooster and crying: “Roosters arecrowing on the earth, while the crying goes high up to the sky”.40Magical Function of GenitalsThe symbolic picture of the human in texts about folklore and ethnographicwork is created on a binary principle. In the vertical perception; the strongestexpressed opposition of the head/the legs, which is seen as binary oppositionup/down, that is the beginning/the ending is translatable in the oppositionclean/unclean. Because the final points on the human body are on the headand the legs, they become a person’s “measure”. Considering that it isbelieved that some people are capable to take away someone’s “measure”with their evil eye; covering the head (with the hat or scarf) and wearingshoes (besides its pragmatic function), has the opposite symbolic effect -that of hiding “the measure” of the human body, as a way of protectionagainst curses.Under the much more severe rule of covering, which is very old and presentin almost all nations worldwide, are the parts of the body from the navel orwaist down including genitals and anus which must be covered at all times.These parts of the body have special status in the culture and except for thecovering they are also forbidden to be spoken of in public. Some magicalactions are, however, based on the intentional breaking of the rule of notshowing and not naming the genitals.41 The complete understanding of thisphenomena would require an in depth discussion of marriage customs andbeliefs connected to sex and birth giving but since that is not the topic, it willbe only mentioned in passing here.Mystery of ConceptionAs many researchers have noted, in some traditional cultures conception isa great secret. Among other “primitive” nations the connection between sexand conception is not understood, or conception is ascribed to unknownforces.42"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"170 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2In Serbian folk stories and poems there exists an international motif of“miracle conception”, where the woman gets pregnant without sexualintercourse, usually when she tastes the powder of a dead man’s skull.43Among Bulgarians the motif of becoming a hero from stone is widespread.The late V. Cajkanovic, an eminent Serbian folklorist, showed theunbreakable connection between marriage customs among Serbs and thecult of the ancestors.44 He noticed that behind the diversity of marriagecustoms lies an inauguration of the bride into a new family unit, which consistsof three parts: leaving the old family unit- coming into a new home- enteringinto a new family unit. The primary meaning of these rituals lies in gettingconsent from the ancestors, the protectors of home, and for the enlargementof family. The second part of marriage customs is the protection of the newcouple from the forces of malevolent spirits. There’s a connection betweenthe ancestors and malevolent spirits. A couple can get in contact with themin spite of the boundary between the living and dead through the sexual act.With certainty one can say that contact is made during the first sexualintercourse. The defloration of the bride means opening the way into theworld of the ancestors and direct contact with them because the femalegenitals are associated with a hole/abyss, and along with that, with the “gate”of the other world.That is why, in a folk riddle, the bride is called “pracijepaca” and thegroom is called “pracijep” (the one who’s making cleft, who opens with asharp and hard tool): “Pracijepaca and pracijep, between them a niceflower (couple and godfather).”45The forcing of sex on a woman is called shattering.46 Virginity is thus veryimportant because the first sexual intercourse is seen as opening the way forthe ancestors. Otherwise some other ancestors, who can be dangerous,may have already made contact and in such cases the bride is returnedhome with a broken ewer in her arms. This is a symbolic way to say that sheisn’t “whole”. If the groom’s family has decided to accept her, it is thefamily’s duty to publicly announce, in a ritual way, that she isn’t a virgin.These announcements are equal to those done when a child is born with acaul over its face. If the family does not ritually announce it, the child becomesa witch (as in demonic being, not a village cunning person)."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 171So, the groom’s first sexual intercourse with a bride means opening the gateof the chthonic world in a symbolic way. This is very risky for him, his familyand community in general because some demonic dangerous force mightcome from that other world. This is why the bride is ushered into a groom’shome accompanied with noise and uproar-to scare away any lurkingdaemonic forces.In Bosnia, when people make noise around the bride and groom’s roomthey are called wolves.47 When we know that wolves are “keepers” of theboundary between wild and social space and that they are enemies ofmalevolent spirits, this magical action is then understandable.The ancient symbolic view of a male’s genitals as “penetrator” and thefemale’s genitals as “abyss” shows that they are the only condition ofconception which is seen as a gift of the chthonic world. At the same time,these body parts, symbolized, on a macro level, place the touch of thishuman world and the other world (shadow of ancestors) between cleanand unclean and tabooed space-their showing and usage are controlled bycommunity laws. Such a thought pattern dictates a fear of a possible irregularrelationship between the living and dead, and an uncontrolled breakthroughof evil souls (unclean force) through the female abyss.The Penis – The Devil – The StoneFor the reconstruction of the ancient beliefs about the genitals there is someimportance of the paradigm of the penis – the devil – the stone, which canbe noticed by comparing certain phraseological constructions in the Serbianlanguage. There are some obscene expressions and vulgar names for thepenis, with which the idea of “destruction” is expressed, similar to theexpression “Go to hell”.48 A similar but emotionally stronger idea can befound in cursing followed by hitting a rock with another rock.49 The wishfor destruction of the cursed one is expressed as capturing into the stone.It should be stressed that the stone has a very wide usage in the charmswhere it has the function of the mediator between the humans and an uncleanforce. Certain cultic stones in southern Serbia and Macedonia are famousbecause women who cannot have children will come to them and perform"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"172 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2certain rituals such as crawling underneath. Symbolically, it could mean an“exchange” of the worlds – crawling underneath the stone a woman “travels”to the Otherworld and “dies” to return again to this world as a new womancapable of having children of her own. There is also another level ofsymbolism in this ritual. By crawling underneath the stone, a woman breaksinto the chthonic space, imitating the entering of the penis into the vagina.Since the times of ancient Greeks and Romans, the usage of the hag stonein magic is widespread, and its chthonic characteristics are shown in thoserituals where it is used.50From medieval and later descriptions of “the meetings of the witches”, veryoften obscene scenes are mentioned, with the devil presiding over them.Eroticism and temptation are the most important characteristics of this being.In one description, he is blamed for the spilling of semen during sleep: “Hecomes whenever, and the semen is spilled because of the dirty thoughtswith which he fills the head of the one who dreams”.51 A euphemism for thewitch is the stone lady.52The motif that connects, at least on the first look, very different words/worlds, is the symbolic connection to the abyss and chthonic space.The Genitals in the Model of WonderIn the folk charms of the Slavs from the Balkans, from both Muslims andOrthodox Christians, there is a circle of certain charms which are createdon the model of wonder; where actors have huge genitals and use themoutside of the parameters of normal usage: - use them as a wand, as adress, wearing them as bags over the shoulders. It is interesting that theirreal name is used despite the fact that it is very uncommon to use the realnames of genitals in patriarchal society. This shows that these charms shouldbe seen as a special form of magical speaking which is used only in specialsituations and only by the special person in question – the spellcrafter. Theones who usually have huge genitals in these charms are dogs, wolves,odd-looking and old men. All charms are against the evil eye. The model ofwonder is created in them and this picture of wonder is produced to distractthe attention of the one with the evil eye. Other than this, we can also speakabout the older level of symbolism – the presence of an androgynous dog-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 2 173like being who exists by itself and has no need to make contact with others.Thus the cursing (evil eye) is a form of taking someone’s quality and withthe breaking of the curse, it becomes formless.ConclusionMagic and religious notions of Slavonic custom show the human body as aspatially organized entity divided according to binary opposition. The bodyis divided into the upper (pure) half, which holds the head and chest, andthe lower (impure) part, holding the rest of the body. The waist marks theboundary between the two parts, and thus has developed as a mediator,and has an important function in magic rituals. The body is also divided intothe right (favorable) and left (unfavorable) side, the front (“one’s own”) andback (“another’s”), the central (stable) and peripheral (changeable) part.The latter parts of the opposites (lower, left, back, peripheral) play a moreimportant role in the performance of magic rituals, as they are associatedwith the space and spirits of the chthonic world. For this reason, specificparts of the human body are preferred above others in magic, such as thefoot, left arm and leg, back of the head, back, heel, hair, nails, and bodysecretion.The principle of symmetry is present in the perception of man – he is asingle with pairs (eyes, ears, nostrils, arms, legs), as opposed to demonswho are often represented as asymmetric. Man is comprised of body andsoul, and differs from demons by his ability to speak, that is, his voice. Insome incantations, voice and tears are elements that build the axis of theworld (axis mundi) in a symbolic manner. Culture develops patterns thatcontrol contacts between the living and the dead. Since the dead affectfertility and fecundity, land and cattle, and the continuation of the familylineage, consummation of the marriage of the bride and groom is important,as a “clearing of the way” to the tree of the forefathers, thus the insistenceon the virginity of the bride.Notes-Editor’s note: where an English translation of a book or journal title is providedthe authors have made this translation"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"174 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 21 Dusan Popovic, Tragovi bogumilske jeresi u srpskom narodnom predanju (TheTraces of Bogumil Heresy in Serbian Folk Tradition) (Beograd: Karadzic IV,1903), 178.2 Sava Majstorovic, Caranja u Macvi (Spells in Macva) (Beograd: Raskovnik X,1983), 19.3 Vlastimir Stanimirovic, Basme (Charms) (Beograd: Arhiv SANU, 1993), 209.4 The term ‘cunning man or woman’ is used after consulting Owen Davies,Cunning-Folk, Popular Magic in English History (London, Hambledon andLondon, 2003), see Ch.7 European Comparisons.5 For comparison of cunning-folk names in different South Slavic nations seefootnote number three in Joseph L.
