Auf Grund ihresumfangreichen Lehrmaterials und wegen der hoch qualifizierten Mitglieder (darunter Alt-philologen, der Begründer der Freudschen Psychoanalyse in Italien, Literaten, erfahreneMitglieder anderer magischer Gruppierungen sowie die Spitze der Anthroposophie in Ital-ien) muss die Gruppe von UR zu den interessantesten magischen Bünden des . Jahrhun-derts gerechnet werden. UR veröffentlichte zur Zeit ihres Bestehens regelmäßig Monat-shefte, die insgesamt auf über eintausendzweihundert Seiten konzentriertes praktischesMaterial aus allen Epochen und Weltgegenden vorlegte. Das Ziel der Gruppe war nichtMystik oder schöngeistige Philosophie, sondern einen tatsächlicher Zugang zu transzen-denten Bereichen aufzuzeigen. Dazu wurde ein nachvollziehbarer Stufenweg vorgezeichnetund in möglichst klaren Worten erläutert. Praktische Texte aus der Alchimie, dem Tantris-mus, Buddhismus, der antiken Theurgie und der Sexualmagie wurden zusätzlich beigezo-gen. Der Stufenweg sollte zu einer echten Gottwerdung (nicht Gottähnlichkeit) führen nachdem Satz Meister Eckharts: “Soll ich Gott unmittelbar erkennen, so muss ich schlechthinErundErmuss ich werden.” Die Möglichkeit dazu bot der Aufbau eines unzerstörbaren“Diamantkörpers”, der auch den physischen Tod überstehen sollte. Die Gruppe von URwar in zwei Fraktionen aufgeteilt. Die eine, die praktisch verwertbare Texte übersetzte undkommentierte und eine zweite innere, die diesen Weg praktisch verfolgte und die dabeigemachten Einzel- und Gruppenerfahrungen in unmissverständlicher Sprache beschrieb.KeywordsJulius Evola; the UR Group; magic; deification; Italian occultism; Arturo Reghini;UR;KRUR; immortality; alchemy; theurgyAlthough the central focus of this essay is the magical UR Group, it will also benecessary to provide an introduction to the philosophy of Julius Evola (–) in this context.

In addition, by the second year of their collaboration heand Reghini had parted ways, and Evola assumed the sole responsibility forleadership. In this role he reformulated many of the essays from other URmembers, and very likely revised some of them according to his own ideas. Thisrevision is particularly conspicuous in the three-volume editions of –and , in which the original essays from the monthly issues were partlyrewritten by Evola, or even replaced with other material. These two differentrevised editions are the basis for all the available versions of the texts in recentdecades.2As to Evola’s influence, it is impossible to understand the beginnings of theUR Group without a more detailed knowledge of his spiritual developmentup to that point.3Particularly important is the connection between his philo-sophical endeavors and the magical conceptions that are present at the outsetof UR.Julius Evola’s Youth and His Artistic PhaseBorn in  in Rome,4Evola was raised a Catholic but struggled against thisand was drawn to writers such as Oscar Wilde, Gabriele D’Annunzio, andArthur Rimbaud. At university he pursued technical and mathematical studies.The writings of Friedrich Nietzsche and Otto Weininger were a great sourceof influence, as was Evola’s personal acquaintance with the young philosopherCarlo Michelstaedter.The impact of these three thinkers cannot be overestimated, as Evola oftenthoroughly identified with them and based his fundamental convictions uponthem. Even later in life they still remained of paramount importance. From1)The two most important works about Reghini are Roberto Sestito,Il figlio del soleandNatale Mario di Luca,Arturo Reghini.2)The description of the magic of UR in this essay is based on the original texts of –.

This seems to concern not only Evola’s attitudes toward the female sexor toward the Jews, but also includes ethical precepts (“truth, purity, loyalty,honesty toward oneself: that is the only conceivable ethic”)7and even politicalviews (the rejection of populism in the broadest sense). Above all, it is Evola’scharacteristic emphasis on virility that essentially derives from Weininger.Carlo Michelstaedter (–) came from a Jewish family in the bor-der region between Friuli and present-day Slovenia.8Michelstaedter studiedmathematics in Vienna, but took his own life at the age of twenty-three, theday after completing his bookLa persuasione e la rettorica(Persuasion andRhetoric). It appears that he felt he could add nothing more to his philo-sophical insights. Michelstaedter’s termpersuasione(‘persuasion’) refers to anabsolute self-sufficiency of the I. Evola explains: “As long as the I is not exclu-sively based upon itself, but is dependent upon an ‘other’” it is subordinateto ‘necessity’ and as a result there is no freedom and “no true persuasion, onlydeficiency” and ‘rhetoric’. And these will never represent an inner ‘value’, forValue is found only in that which exists for itself, which demands the principle of innerlife and personal power from nothing and nobody—in autarchy.9This is how Evola describes the core of Michelstaedter’s philosophy. It is a viewthat remained of central importance for his entire life.Evola called these three thinkers the‘holy damned’ because, despite theirbrilliance, not one of them was psychically strong enough to endure thestrength and force of his own ideas. Two had committed suicide when theywere still young and the third had gone insane. Evola was convinced that theyhad been destroyed by their own heightened internal tension, because theylacked the immovable, unshakable, and therefore superior spiritual element:5)Evola,Il cammino del cinabro, .6)For an overview on Weininger consult Abrahamsen,The Mind and Death of a GeniusandSengoopta,Otto Weininger: Sex, Science, and Self in Imperial Vienna.7)Weininger,Geschlecht und Charakter, .8)A concise reference work is Michelis,Carlo Michelstaedter.9)Evola,Saggi sull’idealismo magico, ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –the connection to transcendence. It was exactly this decisive impulse towardtranscendence that Evola thought had “manifested itself” in him “from hisearliest years”10and which he uncompromisingly strove after.After his return from the First World War, in which he had served as anartillery officer, Evola had similarly fallen into an existential crisis and wasprepared to commit suicide. He only lost his ‘cupio dissolvi’,11as he called it,his ‘desire for dissolution’, when he profoundly understood a passage in theBuddhist Pali canon. It states that the person who believes that the extinctionof life is truly extinction, who then views this extinction as true extinction,who ruminates on this extinction, who indeed believes the extinction ishisand rejoices about extinction, has not understood true extinction at all.12It was through mental and meditative experiments, fortified by the inhala-tion of ether, that Evola finally achieved a transcendent experience of the Selfwhich changed his life and provided him with the firm grounding that wouldhenceforth remain unshaken. Evola described the expansion of consciousnesshe experienced at this moment as a final, shattering, absolute certainty andadded:In order to clarify the difference [between this and] my previous and usual conscious-ness, I can only employ an image: The clearest and most crystalline vigilance in contrastto the state of the deepest, most hypnotic, dullest sleep which brings the greatest pos-sible loss of awareness.13Evola’s extensive hiking and mountaineering experiences in the Alps, andespecially in the glacier regions, were all that was needed to deepen this spiritualattitude. Scaling the peaks was for him a symbol of the spiritual ascent to thedivine, toward what is ever purer, clearer, and more crystalline. Evola speaks ofthe mountain as a holy mountain, a seat of the gods, a medium between heavenand earth. Climbing mountains as mere sport, on the other hand, signified forhim a degradation of the divine.Evola soon came into contact with the artistic circle surrounding the Futur-ists Giovanni Papini (–) and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (–).14Papini introduced him to Eastern wisdom teachings and, most impor-10)Evola,Il cammino, .11)This expression goes back to Tertullian,De patientia,.12)Majjhima Nik ̄ayaI, .13)Iagla (i.e., Evola), ‘Esperienze: La legge degli enti’, .14)Gentile,The Struggle for Modernity: Nationalism, Futurism, and Fascism;Crispolti,Futur-ismo –,andGodoli,Il dizionario del Futurismo."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –tantly, to Meister Eckhart. Eckhart is one of the very few Christian mysticswhom Evola continued to hold in high esteem until the end of his life. In hisSaggi sull’idealismo magico(Essays on Magical Idealism, ) he quotes, forexample, the following passage:Based on this innermost foundation you should perform your works,without a reasonwhy. I state decisively: so long as you perform your work for the realm of Heaven, forthe sake of God or for your own blessedness, in other wordsfrom the outside,youarenottrulyproceedingfromwhatisright.15This statement could be called the leitmotif for Evola’s entire life—actionwithout concern for success or for the acceptance or rejection of others—and itis also a key to Evola’s magic, which is oriented toward achieving a transcendentstate of being.Eckhart is also the source for the following quote, here taken from theedition that Evola himself studied:Being is God ... God and Being are identical. If I am to recognize God in an immediateway, thenImust becomeHeandHemust becomeI... so completely at one, that thisHeand thisIare one, and will become and be one, and exist and act eternally in thisway and form of being.16This is the path to deification, a central concept for the UR Group. That whichsome commentators criticize as hubris on Evola’s part and as a doctrine of‘superhumans’ thus also finds expressionin Meister Eckhart. Plotinus expressedit even more pointedly with his saying “It is for the Gods to come to me andnot for me to go to them”, a phrase that was repeatedly quoted by Evola, andalso in contexts relating to UR.17Evola soon broke with Futurism, a movement whose iconoclastic, revolu-tionary, and polemical assaults on the bourgeoisie had been so attractive tohim. He had come to recognize Futurism as little more than intellectualismcombined with exhibitionist outrage; it lacked a genuinely spiritual, transcen-dent basis. As a result he turned his attention to Dadaism, which was justemerging. A friendship with its main founder, Tristan Tzara (born Samuel15)Evola,Saggi, .16)Meister Eckhart,Deutsche Predigten und Trakate, . Italics from Evola.17)Porphyry,On the Life of Plotinus, .

This represented a worldview in which the drive for total freedomsought to topple all logical, ethical, and aesthetic categories. The Dadaistsdemanded a total abolition of discipline as well as morals. And similarly toteachings from the Far East, they even asserted that the I and the not-I wereidentical, as were affirmation and negation. In the brochureArte Astratta(Abstract Art), written by Evola in , he expresses it in this way:I see art as an interest-free creation that comes from an individual’s higher consciousnessand is therefore capable of transcending the passions and the crystallizations that arebased upon common experiences, and which is independent of them.19These words again indicate Evola’s striving toward transcendent experience.Evola’s Dadaist poetry and paintings, as well as his theoretical essays, makehim the primary representative of Italian Dadaism today. Yet Dadaism couldnot quench his metaphysical thirst, and as a result by  he ceased not onlyhis Dadaist activities but also his artistic career (poetry and painting) in general.The break was as abrupt as it was final.20He was twenty-four years old. His urgefor transcendence drove him to philosophy and metaphysics.Magical Idealism and Influences from the Far EastAccording to Evola himself, his ‘philosophical’ phase dates from the period of to , although due to a lack of publishing opportunities his two pri-mary philosophical works appeared between  and .21His philosophycan be traced to German Idealism (mainly Fichte and Schelling) and furtherback to Plato. From the very beginning only an idealistic philosophy was possi-ble for Evola. In contrast to philosophical realism, this only recognized a worldand nature which are dependent on consciousness, on the I, on the spirit; a phi-losophy according to which everything that we externally perceive represents a18)Valento,Lettere di Julius Evola a Tristan Tzara.OnTzaraseeRichter,Dada.OnEvolaand Dada see Schnapp, ‘Bad Dada’.19)Evola,Arte astratta,.20)In his later years Evola repainted some of his earlier works, but this seems to have mainlybeen at the instigation of a gallery owner.21)Evola,Teoria dell’individuo assolutoand Evola,Fenomenologia dell’individuo assoluto."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –creation of our own spirit, our own I. For Evola, the establishment of theworld through the I (Fichte) is therefore evident and fundamental fact. Ofcourse, for him this does not concern the mundane I, but the transcendentprimordial foundation of one’s own personality. This primordial foundation—which Evola described as the “absolute individual” and equals the Indianconcept of the ̄atman—is not only “the center point of universal responsibility”22but the expression of a complete and abundant power that inevitably grows outof the total realization, as well as the actuallived experienceof this ‘Absolute I.’At the same time the ‘Absolute I’ comprises an unlimited freedom, for it isbased upon itself alone and does not depend upon any external factor.This insight arose from the extremely unsatisfying realization that the philo-sophical idealists simply divided the I into two parts: a powerful, creative, tran-scendental I that could only be understood as purely abstract and speculative;and a different, real I that stands impotent in the face of the mundane worldand can act upon very little that is external to it. In contrast to this, Evolaplaced them both in a single category, a realization that was made possiblefor him through hisexperienceof the Absolute I while under the influence ofdrugs. At that moment he had directly experienced the complete, abundantpower and freedom of the Absolute I, needing only to break through the bar-rier of the illusion of an I that was separate from the cosmos.23Here we find thesource of his ‘magical’ ability of imagination and power—an ability that wasnot just the product of philosophical postulations, but one that was actuallyfeared and admired.In the writings of the French ‘personalist’ philosopher Jules Lagneau (–),24Evola found a sentence which he placed at the beginning of his bookSaggi sull’idealismo magico:Philosophy is the train of thought which, in the end, realizes its own inadequacy andrecognizes the need for an absolute action that has its starting point from within.25With this he hoped, through active and consequential effort, to forge a bridgeto the Absolute.2622)Evola,Teoria del Individuo Assoluto, .23)Iagla, ‘Esperienze: La legge degli enti’, .24)Letellier, ‘Jules Lagneau’.25)Lagneau,RevuedeMétaphysiqueetdeMorale, March , ; here quoted by EvolainSaggi,.26)See Evola,Saggi, f."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –This same impulse toward the overcoming of the ‘conditio humana’ appearsagain and again in Evola’s writings. Taken as a whole, Evola’s philosophy thuspresents itself as a propaedeutic for transcendent ‘initiatory’ realms that are,however, not accessible to everyone but demand a certain qualification.Evola had borrowed the term ‘magical idealism’ for his philosophy fromNovalis’s writings. There he had found not only this term, but also a furtherstrengthening of his thesis regarding the central position of the I. That whichfor Fichte and Schelling is the principle of all philosophy becomes for Novalisthe principle of magic.27Among the latter’s fragments one can read: “Magic is= art to utilize arbitrarily the sensory world”,28“Magic: madness based on rulesand in complete consciousness”,29and finally, “will is nothing but the magical,powerfulability to think”.30Novalis’s magical idealist is someone who is able toturn ideas into external things, as well as to turn external things into thoughts.These considerations and experiences fit completely into Evola’s conception ofmagic.During this phase Evola was also delving into the wisdom teachings of theFar East, which accordingly exerted a strong influence on his philosophicalwork. Evola’sSaggi sull’idealismo magicoalready shows how important theChineseTao Te Chingwas for him.31He cites the following lines from chapter I,asamaximforrightaction:Thus the awakened one, because he puts himself behind, steps in front; because he givesaway, he gains; because he cares not for himself, he is maintained. That is it: becausehe is selfless, he achieves self-fulfillment.32From this brief quote one can see that Evola’s philosophy goes beyond the usualacademic perimeters of the field and reaches deep into spiritual traditions.Equally important were his studies of the HinduBhagavad-Gîtâ,whosedeclarations fortified Evola’s natural predisposition toward the warrior type27)Birven,Novalis, .28)Novalis,Schriften, vol. II, .29)Ibid., .30)Novalis,Schriften, vol. III, .31)Evola also published two very different translations or rather Italian adaptations of theTao Te Chingstrongly based on a German translation by Alexander Ular,Die Bahn und derrechte Weg des Lao-Tse:Evola,Il libro della via e della virtù di Lao-Tzeand Lao-Tze,Il librodel principio e della sua azione. The first text was interpreted according to the philosophy ofGerman idealism, the second according to guidelines based on the Tradition in a Guénoniansense.32)Evola,Saggi, ."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –(Sanskritkshatriya). Evola was aware that external warfare was simultaneouslya symbol of internal warfare, that is, the battle against one’s own personalweaknesses and negative characteristics.33In connection with Meister Eckhartthe lines ofBhagavad-GîtâII,  became the prime model of his thinking:“Perform your actions loyally, abandon any worldly attachment and becomeindifferent to success or failure. Keep your equanimity”.34Evola was particularly drawn to Indian tantra. In , as a result of hisengagement with Taoism Evola became acquainted with Decio Calvari, theleader of an independent theosophical organization in Rome.35Among othersin this lodge he met the Sanskrit scholar Carlo Formichi and most prominentlyGiuseppe Tucci, who would later be recognized as the greatest Asian scholar inItaly. Calvari was the first person to inform him about tantra. Shortly afterwardEvola made contact with Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon), one of theleading experts. Woodroffe’s translations of the original tantric texts along withhis own commentaries supplied the basic material for Evola’s bookL’Uomo comePotenza(Man as Power) which appeared in .36This was, incidentally, thefirst Italian work on the subject of tantra.This particular book forms the link between Evola’s philosophical period andthe one that followed, which could be called his ‘magical’ period. Mere theorywould no longer suffice: he was already striving toward an active and practi-cal breakthrough to transcendence.L’Uomo come Potenzais still strongly influ-enced by his philosophy of magical idealism and its aim of a fully autonomous,all-encompassing, and all-powerful ‘absolute individual’. Up until this point,Evola had only been able to formulate this aim in a theoretical sense. Now, byproviding the tantric texts that contained precise courses of exercise, Woodroffehad given him the ‘technical means’ for a breakthrough to transcendence thatwas practical as well. The emphasis on thepower(shakti) aspect and on thetantric exercises was just what Evola, with his inclination toward action ratherthan contemplation, had been seeking. And it was exactly in this sense thatEvola spoke of a ‘magical self-realization’ in the subtitle of his book.33)In this regard see Evola,Revolt against the Modern World, f.34)These lines are rendered here in the sense that Evola used them.35)The important role of this lodge is discussed in Pasi, ‘Teosofia e antroposofia nell’Italiadel primo novecento’.36)In his workImperialismo Paganop.  Evola spoke about his personal relationshipwith Sir John Woodroffe.

It was through hisstudies in philosophy, however, that his conception of magic first achieved itstrue form. It was only when this structure had been erected, and when Evolarealized—despite his bold speculation regarding an ‘absolute individual’—the inadequacy of even the most daring philosophical constructs in his drivetoward the active overcoming of human limitations, that he turned to a ‘tech-nique’ understood as magic. Only this sort of technique seemed suited forconferring ‘power’ and for attaining the transcendent realm that lies beyondthe mundane human one.A few words are necessary here concerning Evola’s central issue of ‘magicalpower’, since this also characterizes the theoretical conception of magic in thewritings of the UR Group.38For him, power was something that did not merelyderive from the earthly plane, but which had a higher reference point. Asa result, in the practical sense it can also be seen as a ‘divine’ or ‘demonic’attribute with which one can identify. Power operates ‘as if by its own accord’.Power is a necessary characteristic of someone who is truly (spiritually) strong,who is unshakable, who need not even be concerned with it (power). It isbound to such a person by necessity, just as the power of water surges arounda strong bridge pylon in a river, without the pylon itself doing anything. Truepower is unquestionable and operates on its own, it is the unity of subject andobject. This is exactly what is meant by the ‘magical imagination’ which willbe discussed below.Evola employed the same concept of power in his political writings.39Heinterpreted it in the sense of tantra and Tao and disassociated it very strictlyfrom ‘violence’. For Evola, power and violence rather represent opposites.‘Power’ loses its proper essence when it is forced to take refuge in materialmeans, in other words, in violence. When this occurs it is no longer fullyacting ‘magically’ from its own basis, from its own inner superiority. In his firstpolitical book,Heidnischer Imperialismus(Pagan Imperialism, ), Evolatherefore emphasized that37)Regarding this transitional phase between philosophy and magic, see Hakl, ‘Die Magiebei Julius Evola und ihre philosophischen Voraussetzungen’.38)This does not necessarily mean that all members of the UR Group held the same ideas,but it is a fact that the known UR texts that deal theoretically with magic were mostlywritten by Evola.39)Mainly Evola,Imperialismo Paganoand Evola,Gli uomini e le rovine."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –superiority is not based on power, but rather power is based on superiority. To usepower is impotence, and he who understands this will perhaps understand in whichsense the path to a certain renunciation (a‘masculine’ renunciation based on ‘notneeding anything’ and on ‘being satisfied’)40can be a condition for the path to thehighest power, and he can also comprehend the concealed logic, according to which... ascetics, saints, and initiates suddenly and naturally develop suggestive and supra-sensual powers which are stronger than any power of human beings and things.41Power is simply thepurestrength of a spiritual act in which spiritual visionand action meld into one. Whereas the ‘power’ of modern technology merelyuses the existing laws of nature (anyone can flick a switch and the light willcome on), action that emanates from the power of magic presupposes an innerchange of being for the person acting. This change has already elevated him to ahigher level, from which he ‘stands above [material] things’ and has commandover them from the realm of the spiritual.In order to attain such a power, in order toattract42such a power, the spiritand the I must strive toward perfection, toward unification with the ‘gods’.According to Evola, the following Buddhist formula applies here: “In thisbody, eight measures high is the world; [it] contains the origins of the world,the dissolution of the world, and the path to the dissolution of the world”.43And, in a passage that is crucial for understanding Evola’s view of magic, hewrites: “it thus depends uponachieving the direct consciousness that one is thebearer of cosmic, immaterial forces—forces of which Nature represents only thesensualization and petrification”.44Evola seems to have actually achieved some ‘magical power’ in the abovesense, for in his younger years he had the reputation of being a ‘born magician’,a situation which caused Mussolini to take precautionary measures againsthim.45One of Evola’s temporary magical and intellectual companions onthe path was Massimo Scaligero (pseudonym of Antonio Massimo Sgabel-loni, –), a figure who even today attracts a considerable number of40)The strong influence of Carlo Michelstaedter is unmistakable here.41)Evola,Heidnischer Imperialismus,f.Imperialismo Pagano, the earlier Italian version ofthe book from , differs from this expanded German version.42)Evolatakestheideafromtantrathatpower=shaktiand is something ‘feminine’ whichis drawn to the ‘masculine’ unmoved mover, just as eddies in a river form around the bridgepylons.43)Evola, ‘Die drei Epochen des Gewißheitsproblems’.

Scaligero remarked in his esoteric personal historyDallo Yoga allaRosacrocethat Evola already possessed, right from the start as a natural gift, the“original inner quality, the imaginative magic that is the final goal for the mod-ern seeker”.46He further explained that since the “imaginative consciousnessis the precondition for magical consciousness, the art of the student consistsin rediscovering this original imaginative light behind the reflected thoughts”.In contrast to most human beings who are fixed and ‘materialized’ in reflexive(i.e., reflected and not original) and therefore ‘powerless’ thinking that sees theworld dualistically as something lyingoutsideof the individual person, Evolawas already capable of moving on the imaginative plane where the subject andobject are one. For Evola, (operative) ‘power’ therefore precedes knowledge, asScaligero describes it. In other words, Evola did not need to know: he was ableto operate before knowing.Count Pio Filippani-Ronconi (–),47discussed Evola’s magic andcorroborated the statements of Massimo Scaligero in his  presentation at aMilan symposium on the occasion of Evola’s hundredth birthday.48Filippani-Ronconi became acquainted with Evola and other members of the UR Groupin  when he was only  years old,49and at his request Evola showedhim a path to inner realization. This was primarily characterized by constantreference to ‘direct experience’, the Indian concept ofanubhava(‘becoming themeditated-upon object’). The aim of these excercises was “to liberate habitualthinking from the power of the senses and the power of logical and discursiveabstractions”.50Evola’s continually recurring admonition to release oneself from reality andgo beyond it might give the false impression of irrationality. But as even thecritical Thomas Sheehan notes, “Evola’s assertion of the supra-rational over therational is emphatically not a flight to a supra-sensible Beyond, but alwaysremains inner-worldly”51because the origins of the supra-rational lie within46)Scaligero,Dallo Yoga alla Rosacroce,f.47)Filippani-Ronconi was Ordinarius for Indian Religion and Philosophy in Naples andthe author of numerous scholarly works dealing with religious and philosophical topics inconnection with the Near East, Persia, and China.

Evola indeed points out that it is onlyfromlife thatone can achieve superiorityoverlife. Therefore the human being does not haveto take leave of this world: it must simply be extended. Sheehan concludes hisdiscussion with a sentence from one of Evola’s later books: “The other world... is not another reality; it is only another dimension of reality”.52The UR GroupWhen discussing the UR Group one should not imagine a ‘magical’ order witha hierarchical grade system which regularly met for rituals. More likely it was aloose organization in which everyone made individual contributions that Evolathen attempted to pull together. The group also had two different facets. Onthe one hand there was the UR Group that supplied articles for the journalsURandKRUR. Non-members contributed to these journals, which also featuredtranslations of texts from various wisdom traditions. I will initially deal withthis facet of the UR Group, as there is more historically solid material thatrelates to it. On the other hand there was the magically active UR Group,which involved a smaller number collectively (as well as individually) engagedin esoteric exercises and rituals on a regular basis in order to actively pursueinitiatory goals. Naturally there was some overlap between these two groups,with members involved with both facets, the most important such being Evolahimself and Arturo Reghini.Reghini has already been mentioned. Without question he was one of themost important Italian esotericists of the twentieth century, and without himEvola’s rapid spiritual development would probably not have even been possi-ble. Reghini was highly educated in esoteric studies; he was a mathematicianand a neo-Pythagorean. At the same time he was active in the vanguard ofItalian Freemasonry. In , together with Edoardo Frosini and others, hehad founded the Rito Filosofico Italiano, which had the primary intention ofrestoring the original initiatic function to the Freemasonry of his time, whichwas mostly engaged in political and cultural activities, and orienting it towardspiritual values.53Evola had Reghini to thank for his introduction to alchemyand above all for contact with René Guénon (–), who led Evola tothe Integral Tradition. As Evola himself wrote, he owed Reghini a debt52)Evola,Cavalcare la tigre, .53)Sestito,Storia del rito Filosofico Italiano e dell’Ordine Orientale Antico e Primitivo diMemphis e Mizraìm."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –first of all [for] the final liberation from my own chains that ... stemmed from occultgroups and secondly [for] the definitive realization of the transcendence of initiatorywisdom and its completely different nature in comparison with profane culture.54The Reghini expert Gennaro d’Uva recently revealed documentation thatReghini was also a leading member of a magical group inspired by a lit-tle known master with apparently powerful healing abilities called AmedeoArmentano (–). This group, which definitely predated the URGroup, probably took part in the founding of UR’s practical magical workand strongly influenced some of its rituals. It is certain in any case that it sur-vived the unfortunate breakup of UR in , and may have continued activeuntil .55Reghini began publishing the journalAtanòrin  and the journalIgnisin. These two publications dealt with esoteric topics in a rigorous and almostscientific manner that was unusual for its day. They also published writingsby René Guénon, sometimes even before they appeared in French. Evola alsowrote for them and even served as one of the editors ofAtanòr.Withouttheprecedent set by these journals, the appearance of the publicationsURandKRURwould scarcely have been possible.Evola met Reghini, a man twenty years his senior, in Decio Calvari’s inde-pendent theosophical lodge in Rome. Benito Mussolini had taken power inItaly in . Although many freemasons had been involved in the early yearsof the Fascist movement, a law was passed in November  forbidding secretsocieties, and the freemasons consequently came under attack. Because Regh-ini’s involvement in freemasonry was well known, it was impossible for him tocontinue working as the director ofIgnis. As a result he had to cease publica-tion of the journal, but did not want to relinquish the spiritual influence thathad gone along with it. So Reghini and his younger but highly gifted studentGiulio Parise (–), joined forces with Evola to establish a new eso-teric journal, and in January  the premier issue ofURappeared.56Despitethe fact that he was only twenty-eight years old, Evola became the journal’seditor and was solely legally responsible for its content; his was also the only54)Evola,Il cammino, .55)d’Uva, ‘Il pitagorismo iniziatico e magico di Arturo Reghini’.56)Evola traced the word ‘UR’ back to an archaic root which had a connection to ‘fire’ [i.e.,Hebrew], tying in well, then, withIgnisand the alchemical wordAtanor. Along with thisthere is the meaning of ‘primordial’ that the prefixur- has in the Germanic languages.

Parise assisted with financing and wrote articleswhile Reghini worked in the background and also wrote articles.57Since thecontributors had chosen to publish their work under pseudonyms—followingthe example of the Pythagoreans, Rosicrucians, and Hermeticists, in order topreclude personal judgments and vanities—Reghini was able to write for thejournal without problems.In its first yearURcarried the subtitle “Journal with Directions for a Scienceof the I”. From this it is evident that Evola was still attempting to upholdremnants of his philosophical belief in the ‘absolute individual’.58This was aconcept that neither of his partners, interested as they were in purely esotericstudies, were inclined toward, because they saw Evola as being in danger offalling prey to ‘I-mania’. They felt that Evola’s philosophy, despite its referencesto ancient wisdom traditions, was profane, whereas they viewed their ownefforts as being based in the sacred. By the second year the publication’s subtitlehad been changed to “Journal for Esoteric Sciences under the Direction ofJ. Evola, P. Negri, G. Parise”. P. Negri was the pseudonym of Arturo Reghini.Additionally, the character of the journal was unmistakably described in aneditorial remark as “initiatic, hierarchical, traditional, Western, and elitist”,and consequently based on a rejection of purely philosophical theories.59Thediscord between Reghini and Parise on the one hand and Evola on the otherescalated when Evola published hisImperialismo Paganoin the second half of. Reghini had already published an essay of the same title in  and thenrepublished it inAtanòrin . The basic premise of this essay correspondedto that of Evola’s book. Reghini was understandably incensed and felt thatEvola had undermined him.6057)Roberto Sestito, who represents an anti-Evolian viewpoint (see Sestito,Il figlio, ),described the original allocation of work as follows: Reghini was to take charge of thespiritual leadership, Evola was in charge of the political and administrative aspects, andParise had the function of secretary and treasurer.58)In the original version of Evola’s  essay ‘Sulla visione magica della vita’, he writes:“We affirm theIndividual. For us the individual stands at the center point, as a reality, asa value, as a goal, and nothing stands beyond it and nothing is a condition for it”. In latereditions Evola deleted such passages.59)InIl figlio, –, Sestito makes use of unpublished correspondence to inform aboutthis tense relationship between Evola and Reghini.60)This book met with great resistance from Christian circles. It spoke out vehementlyagainst Christianity and condemned the negotiations between the Fascist regime and theVatican which ultimately resulted in the Lateran Accords of ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –There were further grounds for their dissension. Evola found the pro-freemasonic stance of Reghini and Parise too provocative in light of the legalsituation, and for this reason bowdlerized some of their texts, which in turnenraged them. Roberto Sestito even accuses Evola of having removed Reghiniand Parise from the editorial board under some pretense. But Gianfranco deTurris, the director of the Julius Evola Foundation in Rome, also reports anattempt to oust Evola from the editorial directorship by bringing a man intothe equation who was allegedly willing to finance the publication. This even-tuality would have cost Evola his position as editor.61From the start, though,Evola had been appointed as the editor and proprietor responsible forUR.Acompromise was therefore arrived at whereby Evola was allowed to continuepublishing the journal but was obligated to change its name. Evola chose thenew nameKRUR, which he created from the Sumerian rootk-r,k-u-rwith themeaning of ‘dwelling place, house’ together with the added phonetic element‘ur’.So as not to be entirely left without a mouthpiece, Parise and Reghini revivedthe journalIgnisin ,62butwereonlyabletopublishasingleissuewhichwas mostly filled with polemics against Evola. Evola in turn reported in hisautobiographyIl cammino del cinabro(The Path of Cinnabar),63that thoseon the “side of freemasonry”64had attempted to depose him and, when thiswas unsuccessful, to force him to cease the publication ofUR. The argumentsfinally led to mutual legal complaints from both parties, with allegations ofplagiarism on the one side and slander on the other. A reconciliation was nolonger possible. But this was not all, for the conflict also meant the demiseof the actively cooperating magical group in which Reghini, Parise, and Evolawere the primary participants. Evola himself confirms this in his autobiographyat the location cited above.AlthoughKRURretained its magical character with numerous essays thattouched on practical magic and personal experiences, it developed into moreof a philosophical and cultural magazine. Its aim was to lay the spiritualfoundation for a national renewal in Italy, and in this regard it reflected Evola’snew interests.

Having fulfilled the“tasks relative to the technical mastery of esotericism”, there was now a desireto dedicate oneself with renewed vigor to Western culture and to the problems“that, in this moment of crisis, afflict both individual and mass consciousness”.The political had now been introduced, and out ofKRURemergedLa Torre(The Tower), a “combat journal” published every fourteen days which aimed“to erect an unbreachable bulwark against the general decline of every value inlife”65and to reach a broader audience.66However, on Mussolini’s orders this‘combat journal’ was shut down after the tenth issue.The Members of the UR GroupIt should be clearly established from the outset that only men could becomeactive members of the UR Group.67The reasoning behind this was simple:esoterically, only men are bound with the ‘sky’ and thus with transcendence,whereas women are bound with the earth. Just as a man is responsible forspiritual ‘fertility’, a woman is responsible for earthly fertility. A man is nomore in a position to bear a child than a woman is to ‘storm heaven’. Bothsexes have their assignments and these should never be intermingled. Therewas no further discussion about this.As mentioned earlier, the members of the UR Group exclusively used pseu-donyms or symbolic names so that only the inherent value of the individualcontributions would receive consideration and not the author per se. Addition-ally, the teachings presented should not be the product of fantasy or the sub-jective notions of the individual authors, but derive from an ancient fount ofcommon wisdom. The identities of some of the anonymous authors soon cameto be known, while others remain cloaked in obscurity up to today. In his bookJulius Evola e il magico “Gruppo di UR”,68Renato del Ponte, the founder and65)Quoted in del Ponte, ‘Julius Evola and the UR Group’, xxi.66)URhad a print run of about ,, whereasLa Torrewas published in an edition of, copies (del Ponte,Julius Evola e il magico “Gruppo di UR”, ).67)Maria de Naglowska (–), the notorious Russian sex magician (and probablyone of Julius Evola’s former lovers), was not in fact a member of the UR Group, althoughshe wrote one small contribution in one of the issues ofUR.68)This book collects the most important historical knowledge about the UR Group andincludes the ‘Communications to the Readers’ which were printed either as an insert or onthe inside panels of the original journal covers.

In most instances the unsigned inserts to the journals,the introductions, and the glosses were also written by Evola or collectivelyauthored under his direction.In general, del Ponte divides the most significant UR members into threedifferent esoteric ‘schools’. Alongside these schools there were naturally someautonomous authors as well. The Pythagorean school, which was also sympa-thetic to Freemasonry, was primarily represented by Arturo Reghini (pseudo-nym ‘Pietro Negri’) and Giulio Parise (pseudonym ‘Luce’). Both were excep-tionally well trained in magic and wrote correspondingly interesting articles.Also part of this current was Aniceto del Massa (–), an art critic andauthor who contributed an essay toKRURunder the pseudonym ‘Sagittarius’.The most prominent school—and maybe surprisingly so—was that ofAnthroposophy, whose primary representative was the physician GiovanniColazza (–) (‘Leo’). He was one of the founders of the Anthropo-sophical Society in Italy as well as a close confident of Rudolf Steiner and oneof his few personal students.70Because he allegedly did not wish to personallywrite out the teachings that had been handed down to him, thereby disseminat-ing them to the laity, Evola transcribed his essays according to the informationColazza provided. Above all Colazza emphasized the necessity of discardingthe outer husk of general materialistic petrifaction and opening oneself up tothe energies of nature and the cosmos—notions which seem to have consid-erably influenced Evola.71The Anthroposophical school also included CountGiovanni Colonna di Cesarò (–), a democratic politician in whosejournalL’Idea democraticaEvola had published his first political article. Hishas made some important historical research material available. Renato del Ponte’s essay‘Julius Evola and the UR Group’, which appears as the foreword toIntroduction to Magic(the English edition of the first volume of UR texts), is a revised and abridged translation ofhisJulius Evola e il magico “Gruppo di UR”but does not include the documentary material.69)There are, however, objections to del Ponte’s attributions. These mainly come fromAurelio Perenne (probably a pseudonym of Piero Fenili, one of the most knowledgeablecritics of Evola in the political sphere), who made a number of corrections in his reviewentitled ‘Renato del Ponte, Evola e il magico “gruppo di UR”’.70)von Platho, (ed.),Anthroposophie im .

He wrote under the name ‘Gic’. There were probably otherAnthroposophical authors in the group who have not yet been identified (e.g.,‘Alba’).OneofthemostimportantcolleaguesofURandtheauthorofnumerousrevealing and praxis-oriented articles was the classicist Ercole Quadrelli, whocalled himself ‘Abraxa’. He also provided material that Evola then transcribed.Unfortunately we know very little about Quadrelli, except that he belongedto ‘Myriam’, an important initiatory school which was founded and led byGiuliano Kremmerz (pseudonym of Ciro Formisano) (–). Of par-ticular importance are Quadrelli’s two texts relating to sex magic.73Under thepseudonym ‘Tikaipos’ he also published a number of excellent translations ofancient texts and alchemical writings inURandKRUR.A person who exerted a great personal influence on Evola was Guido deGiorgio (‘Havismat’) (–).74After receiving his doctorate he emi-grated to Tunisia, where he came into contact with a local Muslim group.In Paris he met René Guénon, who liked him very much as is evident fromthe many letters which Guénon wrote to him.75Guido de Giorgio was a rareexception in being someone whose criticisms Evola accepted unconditionally.The reason for this was his immensely strong but at the same time instable per-sonality.76After returning to Italy he lived mainly in solitude in the mountains.Along with Nicola Moscardelli (–) (‘Sirio’ and ‘Sirius’), a Catholicauthor and philosopher, Guido de Giorgio was the only other member of URwho leaned toward Catholicism, albeit in his own way.In the scholarly arena Emilio Servadio (‘ES’ and perhaps ‘APRO’) (–) is by far the most well-known member of UR.

He was equally wellknown for his advocacy of scientific recognition for parapsychology. In orderto escape racial persecution during the Fascist period, he chose India as a placeof exile. He was led there by his search for enlightenment and his interest inthe Orient. As he revealed in an interview, he was not involved in the magicalactivities of UR but wanted to write articles for the journals.77He came intocontact with the group because he had known and admired Evola for a longtime.78Servadio also worked on Evola’s journalLa Torre, which came in thewake ofURandKRUR.Another collaborator still to be mentioned, although only in the contextof the journalKRUR, is the alpinist Domenico Rudatis (‘Rud’) (–),the man who introduced the sixth grade (of difficulty) in mountain climbing.Rudatis was a co-author, friend, and also teacher of the world-famous extrememountain climber Reinhold Messner. Corallo Reginelli (‘Taurulus’) (–) is the last UR member to be mentioned here. For a time he was involvedin the Anthroposophical circles under the leadership of Giovanni Colazza. Aquestion that still remains is how the names of other contributors such as‘Arom’, ‘Nilius’, and ‘Zam’ should be treated. Are they real people who havenot yet been identified or are they “purely symbolic names that simply embodycertain specific spiritual directions”, as Evola wrote?79In – and in  new editions were published of the essays fromURandKRURwhich Evola had thoroughly revised and assembled into threevolumes. They appeared collectively under the titleIntroduzione alla magia,quale scienza dell’io(Introduction to Magic as a Science of the I) and with nomention of Evola by name.80In revising this edition Evola deleted materialhe thought was no longer relevant or which had already been published inbook form.

However, in the new revised editionof –, and therefore after Guénon’s death, in the third volume ofthe collection there surprisingly appeared an article by Guénon under thepseudonym ‘Agnostus’; this article,though, dealt merely with symbolism.87In the same volume Evola also published a sharp reply to Guénon’s bookAperçus sur l’initiation. Here he questioned the chain of initiatory transmissionfrom master to master which Guénon believed necessary, and suggested “self-initiation” as a possibility in extraordinary circumstances.88Another important author is the aforementioned Massimo Scaligero (Mas-simo), whose work did not appear until the revised edition of –. Atthe time the UR Group actually existed he had been too young and did noteven know Evola, though he later became one of his best friends and even partof the security that protected Evola from the fascistsquadristi.

Natale Mario de Luca,who represents an anti-Evolian, pro-Guénonian, and pro-Masonic viewpoint,went so far as to say that withUR, “the overall picture that results from a firstreading, and unfortunately a second reading as well, is that of a hodgepodgecollection, where heterogeneous and in the end terribly disparate views andefforts which cannot be reduced to any common ground are found side by sideand to which is added some practical information in fragmentary fashion”.89This is a harsh judgment that cannot be taken at face value. To be sure, a collec-tion of material from independent intellectuals and esotericists of the caliberfound in UR inevitably yields very heterogeneous results. For example, if wewere to transpose this situation to a cultural-philosophical plane, an anthol-ogy that dealt with the decisive questions of human existence and includedcontributions by theologians, sociologists, philosophers, literary figures, andpsychologists would result in similarly disparate views.Nevertheless, the collaborators inURharbored common goals and theirstrivings stemmed from a shared feeling of theexperiencedinadequacy result-ing from a merely cultural, philosophical, and bourgeois religious position. Asa result, the first volume began with a truly stirring analysis of the existen-tial situation facing a human being who seeks meaning in the modern world:someone for whom all spiritual certainties are gone, since all extant religiousand philosophical theories have shown themselves as flawed human produc-tions, and who is cast back in despair to his own naked I and forced to ask theterrifying question:What am I?This analysis, simply titled “To the Readers” and probably composed byEvola himself, already reveals the essential characteristics that led to theresounding success of theURanthologies.90Whenthefirstvolumewaspub-lished in an English translation, Joscelyn Godwin remarked: “This is a powerful89)Luca,Arturo Reghini, f.90)Following the publication of the original journals and the two revised editions by Evola,there have been numerous Italian reprints of the final edition from .

One can be quite certain that it will stillhave readers centuries from now”.91The justification for such an assessment is simple: the individual mono-graphs are all written by authors who had actually experienced with their ownbodies the things they describe—by enduring, practicing, and then simply andtruthfully reporting about it. The approach is a ‘no-nonsense’ one which ruledout any ‘esoteric’ games from the start: it is simply based on the author’s ownpractical experience which is then immediately to be put into practice again.No one spoke of an invented tradition of ancient masters as precursors, norwith the pretention of having been personally initiated by such fictional fig-ures. Also absent were any embarrassing posturings of ‘infinite love’ as a motivefor the transmission of ‘higher realizations’ to a needy flock. Instead one findsmaximum clarity and an often masterful choice of magical terminology, allow-ing the readers to place themselves imaginatively (and also emotionally) inthe spiritual situation being discussed. There was no heavy-handed attemptto overwhelm the readers or to forcefully persuade them of anything. The per-suasion had to arise solely from the inner strength of the essays themselves,which can be astonishingly effective even today.To ensure such a standard also meant a certain lack of compromise. Oftenthe reader must make an accommodation to the texts, and initial effort isalso necessary to comprehend the pictorially configured language, which inmany cases was based on the example of hermeticism. This was, however,continually illuminated in a methodologically adroit way through mutuallycomplementary articles. Suitable words and terms are for the most part lackingor misleading when describing a progressive spiritual path. Precisely becauseof their polyvalence (multitude of meanings), images and symbols are often‘more clear’ and ‘on target’ than any allegedly clear-cut, and therefore strictlydelimited, logical terms. The human spirit also operates far beyond logic; forexamples of this one need only consider its expressions through poetry ormusic. Renato del Ponte sums up his assessment as follows: “In conclusion wewould emphasize that the treatises found inIntroduction to Magicare definitelynot designed for the general public, but for a few qualified people ...”.92Weaker contributions can also of course be found among the texts, but thesewere very few.

Thisthread was something to which everyone concerned could connect, and it musthave been so auspicious that they were all willing to make the effort of writinglong essays for publication in this common forum. Many of these decidedlyautonomous people also consented to work together in the magical circles,which they called ‘chains’, for higher goals.In principle UR wanted to enlist people who did not retreat from thepreviously described existential crisis, who did not evade it, and who wouldnot accept false solutions to it. For such people the ‘alternative’—what theysawasdyingaslowspiritualdeath—wasjustasunacceptable.Intheendthisrequired those who were firm of purpose “to dissipate the fog and blaze atrail”,93“without trembling before the darkness”. Their radically formulatedcommon goal was: “the realization of oneself, in itself, and of existence. Thator nothing”. This goal, kept clearly in sight, was understood as a transcendentexperience—not something dependent upon divine grace, but a state which hadto be achieved on one’s own. To achieve this entailed struggle, a battle againstone’s own weaknesses, as well as asceticism in the Greek sense of hard ‘practice’,and not at all in a Christian-moralistic sense.As in modern science, moral and ethical questions do not play a role in UR.The path was goal-oriented and presented without moral value judgments.94Inthis sense it was not immoral, but amoral. This attitude had nothing whateverin common with the ones held by modern so-called satanic groups. The latterprimarily base themselves on the ego, as well as overtly on the judgmentsand desires of the individual, whereas the path of UR (at least in theory) wassupposed to proceed in a way that was transpersonal and ‘ego-free’, as well asbeing ‘ascetic’ in the sense described above.The transcendentalexperienceand knowledge being striven after in turn pre-supposes a transcendent spiritual ‘change of one’s inner being’, a prioropustransformationis. This requires nothing less than a merciless transformation ofone’s own instinctual nature, for according to UR it is only such a fundamental‘mutation’ that makes it possible for the human being to gain access to highertranscendent realizations and experiences. Abstract-philosophical or emotionalconsiderations were no more relevant than were ‘good’ or ‘evil.’ Spiritual atti-tudes based on a faith or philosophy could only scratch the surface. The trans-93)This and the quotations that follow come from the introduction in the first issue ofURentitled ‘To the Readers’.94)See also EA, ‘L’esoterismo e il superamento della morale’."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –formation had to come on a much deeper level. “You must transform yourself.You must overcome yourself. You must make yourself whole and lift yourselfup to a higher honor”.95The demand was not merely for self-awareness, butfor self-creation. Only in this way could the personality ascend toward tran-scendence.For UR, this magical process of self-creation was no mere ‘myth’ or ‘pleas-ant fantasy’, nor was it a dry intellectual goal. It was bursting with life andexperience. Underlying this was the conviction that such a path had existedsince primordial times, even if it repeatedly fell into obscurity and was troddenonly by solitary and often unknown ‘initiates’. Numerous testimonies and ref-erences from wisdom literature around the world were believed to corroboratethis.A process of ‘clarification’ or ‘cleansing’ was seen as paramount for this ‘self-creation’. This entailed the gradual shedding of mundane traits—similar to thepath through the planetary spheres as described in antiquity—until one wasfinally able ‘purely’ and with open eyes to confront the ‘divine’ (the sphere ofthe ‘fixed stars’).96It was a straight and thoroughly practical path.The task of the UR Group, then, was to make this path viable again in themodern era. To this end they thoroughly scrutinized the mysteries of antiq-uity, ancient theurgical texts, as well as the hermetical and alchemical works ofthe Middle Ages and the early modern era. The teachings of yoga, tantra, Tao-ism, and Buddhism were likewise studied. The realizations and ‘signposts’ theydiscovered were compared with one another and brought together in order toreformulate them into ascience—allegedly in line with an ancient tradition.“A science—a precise, strict, and methodical science, that was passed on fromflame to flame, from initiate to initiate in an unbroken chain, even if it becameonly rarely manifest to the outside world”. Just as profane science arrives at itsknowledge on an experimental path and only by taking objective and imper-sonal criteria into account, so too should this spiritual path advance in the samemanner. Opinions were of no consequence on this path; all that mattered wereverifiable results and knowledge based upon personal experience. This surely isa realistic and modern attitude, and one which can be traced back with somecertainty to the influence of Arturo Reghini and Giuliano Kremmerz.9795)This and the following quotations come from the aforementioned editorial in the firstissue ofURentitled ‘To the Readers’.96)Evola later described this spiritual clarification process very precisely in the light oforiginal Buddhist teachings and terminology in his bookThe Doctrine of Awakening.97)Contrary to a number of opinions, Evola himself can also be basically characterized"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –And yet it was amagicalscience: one that did not focus on external phenom-ena or results, but concentrated on the inner human being and on awakeningspiritual energies necessary to navigate the path. And it was an initiatic sciencebecause it opened the ‘gateway’ to transcendence, to the ‘divine’, and even didso by necessity, because the person who was ultimately ‘initiated’ had grownupward toward the divine and had become one with it.The path of UR did not entail ‘ceremonial magic’ in the sense of theOrder of the Golden Dawn or what might be found in medieval grimoires.That was viewed as ‘lower’ magic. UR strove toward ‘High Magic’ which canbe defined as a ‘practical metaphysics’ with the goal of self-deification. It ischaracterized by a sovereign,dominatingattitude with regard to the spiritualrealm. A humble, passive, or personality-effacing demeanor, such as might benecessary for spiritistic98or shamanic practices, was therefore ruled out. To beawake was everything.In other words, the ‘ultimate goal’ of UR was to elevate man to sucha level that he transformed himself into a god. Here one might recall thestatements from Meister Eckhart and Plotinus which were quoted above inconnection with Evola’s philosophical studies. Taken together it was anopuscontra naturam, an operation against one’s own inner human and dependent,passive nature, a work of liberating the body, soul, and spirit from their ‘natural’material characteristics. It is a goal that in Christianity might well correspondto the only unpardonable sin, the ‘sin against the Holy Spirit’. And only fewpeople are probably capable of seeing it as anything other than a terrible act of‘hubris’ against God.99as a modern thinker. Modernity is a necessary prerequisite to his anti-modernism. Seealso in this regard the very instructive article by Gianni Ferracuti, ‘Modernità di Evola’.Concerning Evola’s modern methodology, which is present in nearly all of his books, itshould be emphasized that it is conjoined with a particularly fine intuition when he isinvestigating ancient or foreign religious language and symbolism. This is clearly pointedout by Stefano Arcella in ‘Julius Evola e la riscoperta dei Misteri di Mithra fra influenzeesoteriche e letteratura storica-religiosa’, .98)Emilio Servadio has, however, pointed out that theKRURarticle ‘Esperienze di catena’showed the existence of spiritistic-psychic phenomena. In this regard see also Giuli, ‘J. Evolae le polemiche sull’esoterismo’. In an anonymous article (but most probably written by Evolahimself) ‘Fenomeni magici e fenomeni psichici’ inKRUR, the author counters Servadio’sarguments stressing the ‘intentionality’ of the Ur group as opposed to the psychic automa-tisms reigning during séances.99)Also to be kept in mind here is the ‘daimon’ in the ancient Socratic sense or theconversation with the ‘Holy Guardian Angel’in the teachings of Aleister Crowley, both"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –Particular attention was paid by UR to the doctrine of ‘conditional immor-tality’. A belief that an immortal soul existed in every human being or a beliefin reincarnation were both considered exoteric illusions. Instead, a person hadto create an absolutely stable core of consciousness for himself by his ownstrength, a core that was invulnerable and capable of withstanding even thetrauma of ‘physical’ death. Around this core a ‘diamond body’ was then to beconstructed which would replace the deceased fleshly body as a new vehiclein more subtle realms of existence.100It is only under these circumstances thatimmortality is possible. A parallel notion is evident in theCorpus Hermeticum(X, ): “Therefore we must dare to say that the human on earth is a mortalgod but that god in heaven is an immortal human”.101The path to this goal corresponded exactly to the aforementioned cleansingprocess and began with the liberation of the self from its ‘earthly chains’.Initially this concerned one’s own emotions, in particular fear and especiallythe fear of death. This was described in ancient hermetic style as the struggleagainst the ‘waters’ which primordially and powerfully surge against us, tearingthe ground from under our feet and carrying us away if we do not develop thecharacteristics of ‘centeredness’ and ‘stability’. We must be bridge pylons in theviolent stream of life, then the waters cannot harm us. One must bear these upwith the powers—in alchemical language—of ‘our steel’: hard, tough, and yetflexible.102A further step was the liberation of the self from its usual limited self-image.Only in this way could the view be opened to higher realms. The goal of theentire cleansing process—expressed in hermetic language—was to separate the‘dense’ from the ‘subtle’, until the ‘inner sun’, the ‘gold’, the ‘divine spark’ or the‘incorruptible core’ was liberated and formed the center of an absolute stableconsciousness.One of the key exercises to clear the way through the initial darkness wasthe sun exercise. Before falling asleep the practitioner imagined an inner sunof which concern a communication between the everyday I and the ‘higher self.’ A modernpsychologist would probably speak of a direct access of the I to the unconscious. The initiatein the sense of UR has, however, totally integrated his I into the ‘higher self.’100)Here, too, the influence of Kremmerz’s teachings is evident. See d’Uva, ‘SapienzaErmetica e Magia in Giuliano Kremmerz’, . This influence is certainly present, althoughKremmerz—in contrast to the official stance of the UR Group and especially of Evola—wasdisposed toward the theory of reincarnation and the ‘progressive.’101)Copenhaver (trans.),Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepiusin a new English Translation, .102)Luce, ‘Opus Magicum: La concentrazione—il silenzio’, ."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –that arose to illuminate the dark of night; upon awakening this sun was thenallowed to set again, because now the physical light could illuminate the world.The goal was to achieve a continuity of consciousness so that one was constantly‘awake’, also in an increasingly higher sense of the word. Ultimately a point wasreached at which this ‘divine’ core of consciousness could lead the candidate,completely ‘awake’ in the ‘diamond body’, to ‘immortality’.103Exercises utilizing the imagination and the creation of inner images104accompanied the entire magical path. But the development of the ‘magical’imagination had (and has) nothing to do with arduous efforts or a ‘strong will’,for it comes about by itself. It is at once both ‘visionary gaze’ and ‘action’. It isthe unity of subject and imagined image. The imagination fixates the image,unifies itself with it, grasps it fully, and can do nothing else but take the magusto where the imagined image indicates. For according to magical belief, as soonas the image is imagined in the right way, the spiritual-‘supernatural’ presup-position for the attainment of the imagined content is already set. At this pointit ‘only’ needs to crystallize in the earthly ‘realm’.105‘Magical’ knowledge arises in exactly the same manner. Here, too, thepresupposition is an identification with the object to be known. For only then,when one is unified with it, can one truly ‘know’ it—in other words, knowit from the inside out. Evola describes this as ‘active identification’.106Thehighest ‘object’ for active identification was the ‘divine spark’, the Self that mustassume the place of the everyday I. At this stage one has ‘finally’ reached thetranscendent ‘divine’ realm. Immanence and transcendence have then becomeone.Image magic, mirror magic, breathing techniques, astral travel, the expe-rience of the ‘subtle bodies’—all these things would be taught on the path,although not for their own sake, but always in subordination to the highergoal of ‘becoming divine’. This is likewise the case with the sex magic of URwhich had been introduced by ‘Abraxa’ and derived from the teachings of Giu-liano Kremmerz.107Itsultimatepurposewastheovercomingofsexualityper103)EA, ‘La dottrina del ‘corpo immortale’’, .104)A very interesting comparison of the work with the inner images by UR and inautogenic training appears in Cardinale, ‘Il Training Autogeno di J. Schultz e le technichepsico-fisiologiche del Gruppo di UR’.105)The parallels here with Evola’s philosophical period are unmistakable.106)EA, ‘Come poniamo il problema della conoscienza?’, .107)SeealsothesectionontheURGroupinHakl,‘TheTheoryandPracticeofSexualMagic, Exemplified by Four Magical Groups in the Early Twentieth Century’, –."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –se, so that one could, in terms of the cleansing process, dedicate oneself entirelyand freely to the actual goal of one’s own ‘divinity’.One highly relevant and specific point only appeared in symbolic form108in the original publications ofURandKRUR, although it surely representedan essential, albeit hidden, premise for UR—or at least for Evola himself. Thegroup’s magical path of illumination was predicated on an absolute certaintythat admitted no doubts whatsoever regarding the existence of an incorruptible‘divine’ core of consciousness in the human being. And Evola had arrived atthis certainty through the all-eclipsing drug experience of his youth. This factis pointed out by Franco Landriscina in an informative essay where he alsoemphasizes the sobriety and clarity that are evident in Evola’s description ofthis experience. As Landriscina notes, only decades later would writings aboutdrug experiences begin to show these qualities.109There are two notable texts which would be ill received or even seen asbizarre by the majority of people today. Both of them were written by Evolapersonally. The first of these is an essay in which Evola takes a firm posi-tion against the theory of evolution, for he always conversely upheld a ‘the-ory of involution’. The second essay, which affirmed Evola’s theory of anAryan-Nordic primordial homeland, was inspired by the symbology of Her-man Wirth, the matriarchy researcher and co-founder of the ‘Ahnenerbe’department administered by the SS.110In general, however, the issues ofURandKRURcomprised a collection ofreports on magical experiences along with practical exercises and backgroundmaterial, the likes of which can scarcely be found elsewhere with the samedegree of precision and clarity. Those who engage with the texts will likely findin them the outline of a path that others (probably) have trodden before andwhich is claimed to have the potential to lead serious seekers and practitionersout of the ‘earthly’ realm and into the ‘transcendent’ one.A unitary ‘integral’ Tradition was postulated as the fundamental presump-tion for the path. Although this Tradition might well have assumed different108)Iagla (probably Julius Evola), ‘Sulle Acque corrosive’. Only in the third revised editionof  did the anonymous author (probably Evola himself) of the article entitled ‘Sulledroghe’ speak in clear language and analyze in detail the use of drugs in the initiatic realm.At the same time he issued a warning against aprofaneuse of drugs because the complexphysiological and psychological interplay that this involves can be destructive for people.109)Landriscina, ‘Il Gruppo di UR e la via iniziatica alla psichedelia’.110)Arvo, ‘L’origine delle specie secondo l’esoterismo’ and EA, ‘Sul simbolismo nordico-atlantico dell’anno’."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –outer manifestations, in its essence it allegedly always expressed the samething.111It is said to recur among all peoples and may manifest among themartial, royal, or priestly elites. It can be found in ancient symbols, myths, andrites, the origins of which stretch back into prehistoric times. The ideas of RenéGuénon are clearly in evidence here—ideas which Evola continued to adoptand later expand upon. And there are alsoURessays which contain the centraltheses for two of Evola’s books, namelyRivolta contro il mondo moderno,112which is inconceivable without the influence of Guénon, andLa tradizioneermetica.113All in all, the journals ofURandKRURsought to present the ‘science’they offered through articles that organically built upon and complementedone another, thereby laying the foundation for a systematic form of higherdevelopment. In stark contrast to the equally impressive journalsAtanòrandIgnis,URandKRURdid not only deal with metaphysical questions, historicalexplanations, and symbology. The members of the UR Group had already beenintellectually educated and committed to esoteric knowledge for a long time.What was important for UR was to show the path of direct personal andexperiential knowledge. Rather than writing about “dusty scholarship” theystrove “to awaken inner powers, to clarify, and to guide”.114A characteristic of the journals was to follow the individual essays with theso-called ‘glosses’ in which difficult aspects in the articles are worked through,so as to avoid obscurity as much as possible. As proof of intellectual honesty,some essays were also included which recounted failed experiments, so thatlessons might be learned from them.A further distinctive feature of the journals came in the form of the numer-ous and often quite lengthy texts from a wide range of esoteric and religioustraditions. These were not presented for the sake of cultural education, but cho-sen primarily on the basis of their utility in conveying information about theinitiatic path. To this end, qualified contributors provided commentaries that111)Without this basic assumption it would not have been possible always to deduce thesame meaning and practical instructions from the most varied traditions ranging fromBuddhism to alchemy.112)First edition:Rivolta contro il mondo moderno(Milan: Hoepli, ).

Here, for example, many Italian translationsof sacred texts were published for the first time. Already starting in the first vol-ume these included an excerpt from theKularnava Tantrabased on the trans-lation by Arthur Avalon (John Woodroffe), even before this had appeared inEnglish, as well as excerpts from the BuddhistMajjhima Nik ̄aya(the so-calledMiddle-length Discourses of the Buddha) and from the TibetanShri ChakraSambhara. Of particular importance was a philologically flawless translation ofthe only completely preserved magical ritual of antiquity, namely the MithrasLiturgy from the “Great Magical Papyrus of Paris”. There were also excerptspublished fromDe Mysteriisby Iamblichus as well as translations of alchemicaltexts. Even though the scholarly aspect of these presentations was not empha-sized, they were nevertheless in accord with the academic standards of the day.In the second year ofURnotable translations that were published includedthe PythagoreanGolden Verses, texts by Milarepa, and the famousTurba Philo-sophorum.InKRUR, excerpts appeared from Plotinus, Giovanni Pico dellaMirandola, and Gerhard Dorn’sClavis Philosophiae Chemisticae. Other textswere published from a range of contemporary writers including Gustav Mey-rink, the esteemed specialist in Middle Eastern and Oriental studies PaulMasson-Oursel,115and the Czech symbolist poet Otokar Brˇezina.The Inner Core, or the Magically Active GroupUnfortunately there is very scant information available about the inner core ofthe UR Group. Besides the main group in Rome, there was at least one branchin Genoa which existed until  and was comprised of five members whoseidentities remain unknown.116The main Roman group may have at least con-sisted of Evola, Reghini, Parise, Quadrelli, and Colazza. Whether or not therewere others who participated will probably remain forever uncertain.117While115)Masson-Oursel was in contact with René Guénon (see the letter dated June , ,from Guénon to Guido de Giorgio reprinted in de Giorgio,L’instant et l’éternité, f.)which in turn could have paved the way for Evola.116)Gruppo di Genova, ‘Esperienze di catena’, f., and del Ponte,Evola e il magico‘Gruppo di UR’,f.117)del Ponte, ‘E come esoterismo’, ."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –some members were satisfied with simply reading the journals, others under-took the individual exercises described in them and supplemented these withgroup work. They came together in groups called ‘catene’ (‘chains’), in whichthe ‘links’ were not supposed to fuse but to continue working as individu-als.118The meetings began with the members concentrating on ‘silence’ or innertranquility. After this a state of ‘sympathy’ with the other ‘links in the chain’was invoked and finally, in a dynamic magical working, they collectively drew agreat pentagram in the room. The members themselves then sat well protectedin the center of the pentagram.The actual purpose of the gathering was the creation and vivification of a‘fluidic stream’ that could then be used for magical purposes. This stream wasmainly to serve the individual development of each participant. But there wasalso a further goal of creating a collective ‘psychic’ entity, a so-calledegregore,which would be formed in such a way that it could actually attract ‘higher’energies to itself. With the help of this egregore the group hoped to exert a‘behind-the-scenes’ influence on the political situation of the day.We know about this plan because Evola himself spoke of it,119and thereis also a strange case history published inKRUR. The enigmatic ‘Ekatlos’120who signs this is shrouded in considerable mystery. Some have speculatedthat ‘Ekatlos’ might have been Count Leone Caetani (–), a socialistpolitician (Mussolini was also originally a socialist!) and renowned Orientalistscholar.121It now seems probable, however, that this essay was written by awoman who came from the Kremmerzian milieu.122And what does this report from ‘Ekatlos’ say? In the period around Decem-ber , , a group of esotericists was said to have found ritual objects,together with instructions for a rite, in an ancient grave near Rome. This ritewas then performed every night for months until—probably clairvoyantly—“martial powers promising victory” allegedly made themselves manifest,118)Anon., ‘Istruzioni di catena’.119)Evola,Il cammino, .120)Ekatlos, ‘La ‘Grande Orma’: La scena e le quinte’.121)See, e.g., G.M., ‘Guénon, de Giorgio et la “réorientation” de Julius Evola’, f.122)There are a number of investigations into this question. The most important of theseare probably Arcella, ‘L’enigma della grande orma’; Capiferro and Guzzo, ‘Le Quinte, lascena, la grande orma’; and last but not least del Ponte, ‘Quando il Gruppo di Ur cercòd’influenzare il Fascismo’."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –powers possessing knowledge of a prophetic nature about the political futureof Italy. This esoteric group was said to have then informed the future dictatorBenito Mussolini that he was destined to be “consul of Italy”. This was in and therefore three years before Mussolini’s actual takeover. In ,when Mussolini became Prime Minister, this same group presented him witha fasces containing an ancient Etruscan axe.123According to this report by‘Ekatlos’, then, forces “from beyond” had designated Mussolini as the leaderyears beforehand.The active core of the UR Group now wanted to support these forces withrituals. The goal was to influence Mussolini to resurrect the ancient paganImperium Romanumand to sharply curtail the Catholic Church. The successfulsigning of Lateran Accords between the Fascist Italian state and the Vatican inFebruary  completely destroyed this attempt, and could only be seen as asign of the abject failure of the magical endeavor. This was probably one reasonwhy Evola created the social and political paperLa Torreout of the esotericjournalKRUR.In conclusion it should be mentioned that at the end of the s a ‘Gruppodei Dioscuri’ (Dioscuri Group) formed in Rome, the members of which dedi-cated themselves to performing magical exercises and rites in emulation of theUR Group. In addition to developing the magical abilities of its members, thisgroup also strove for the resurrection of ancient Roman glory and greatness.But this endeavor also went awry, and there were even members who ended upcommitting suicide. The magical currents set in motion seem to have becometoo powerful—even uncontrollable—for them. Years later, a Dioscuri membernamed Luigi Moretti revealed details about the group’s practices and expresslywarned against such exercises.124Another known member was Dr. Placido Pro-cesi, Evola’s personal physician for many years.125There are, however, individual filiations of the UR Group whose effortscan be seen in a positive light. One of these existed in Messina under Sal-vatore Ruta, who created the Centro Studi Tradizionali Arx out of this group.Together with his fellow comrades-in-arms Ruta then established the Movi-mento Tradizionalista Romano, which continues up to the present under the123)The fasces, an ancient Roman imperial symbol consisting of a bundle of rods and anaxe, was carried by the so-called lictors (civil servants) in front of the highest dignitaries.124)Moretti, ‘La dinamica del respiro’.125)On the Dioscuri Group further information can be found in Fenili, ‘Il Gruppo deiDisocuri come tentativo di ripresa dell’esperienza del Gruppo di Ur’."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Hans Thomas Hakl / ARIES  () –direction of Renato del Ponte.126The group performs ancient Roman rites, butnothing more detailed is known about their magical exercises and rituals.Allegedly there have been further, more marginal attempts to revive theUR Group, but since these completely lacked any great personalities like theoriginal members of the s, they have failed miserably. According to thelatest rumors, two or three small groups may still exist. They are said to be ledby former members of the Dioscuri Group and to operate in complete secrecyin the vicinity of Rome and in Sicily.But now as ever, the fundamental ideas and key exercises of the UR Groupare still available via the collective volumes that Evola edited and which havehad a broad distribution. As a result, there is nothing—save individual incom-petence—that stands in the way of new attempts to tread the path laid by theUR Group.BibliographyAbrahamsen, David,The Mind and Death of a Genius,NewYork:ColumbiaUniversityPress, Agnostus (René Guénon), ‘Su due simboli iperborei’, in:Introduzione alla magia,editedbyGruppo di UR.
