H anegraaff Professor, History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands Abstract Fiction dans le désert du réel: la mythologie Cthulhu de Lovecraft En partant d’une note de Mircea Eliade (1976), cet article qui porte principalement sur l’œuvre de fiction de H.P. Lovecraft entend marquer que l’existentialisme nihiliste a connu, sous certains de ses aspects, un prolongement au sein du milieu “holiste” et occulte depuis les années 1960. Dans un essai long et pénétrant paru en 1991, l’écrivain français Michel Houellebecq a mis l’accent sur le nihilisme radical qui sous-tend les écrits de Lovecraft . Or, le présent article veut montrer que la perspective radicalement “désenchantée” qui sous-tend l’œuvre lovecraft ienne n’est nullement incompatible avec le fait qu’il utilise certains thèmes tirés de l’histoire de l’ésotérisme occidental, non plus qu’avec le fait que, depuis les années 1960, des occultistes ont embrassé avec un grand enthousiasme son univers de fiction. Selon la perspective de l’auteur, la suite d’histoires racontant la “quête de rêve” (dream-quest) du protagoniste Howard Carter, d’une part, et les histoires d’horreur fondées sur la “mythologie Cthulhu”, d’autre part, sont les deux aspects d’une même médaille, en ce sens que cette suite représen-terait le désir de Lovecraft de “fuir la réalité” pour un monde de rêves, tandis que ces histoires d’horreur suggèreraient que derrière l’écran vide et prosaïque de la réalité désenchantée se cache une réalité plus profonde encore, faite d’horreur pure. Dans sa partie finale, l’article traite de ce phé-nomène surprenant qu’est le “chaos magick” lovecraft ien, avec ses rituels d’invocations de divinités ou de démons lovecraft iens. Ces invocations ne sont pas l’expression de quelque croyance naïve selon laquelle les entités de Lovecraft existeraient réellement au lieu d’appartenir à la fiction; elles sont plutôt l’expression d’un refus bien plus radical, “postmoderne”, de la distinction même entre fiction et réalité. Et pourtant, les magiciens du chaos ne peuvent pas toujours s’arranger pour main-tenir cette position de façon constante; sous leur déconstructionisme radical on peut voir poindre ici et là, en eff et, une aspiration romantique, celle d’un ré-enchantement du monde.

They believe that death is stronger than life, and therefore dead things must be stronger than living things.1 1. Introduction In a well-known article published in 1976, Mircea Eliade devoted some pages to the ‘unexpected and incredible success’2 in the 1960s and 1970s of the French magazine Planète, and of the bestselling book written by its two editors Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, Le Matin des magiciens (1961). Eliade argued that the success of Pauwels and Bergier’s book and magazine could only be under-stood as a reaction to the French cultural milieu of the late 1950s, dominated by what he called the ‘gloomy, tedious, and somehow provincial’ atmosphere of existentialism.3 Planète had ‘the eff ect of a bombshell’ because its entire orienta-tion was so completely diff erent: . . . what was new and exhilarating for the French reader was the optimistic and holistic outlook which coupled science with esoterism and presented a living, fascinating, and mysterious cosmos, in which human life again became meaningful and promised an end-less perfectibility. Man was no longer condemned to a rather dreary condition humaine; instead he was called both to conquer his physical universe and to unravel the other, enigmatic universes revealed by the occultists and gnostics.4 Although there is much truth in Eliade’s analysis, it might easily have the eff ect of obscuring the other side of the coin, which will be the main focus of this arti-cle: the continuation of (elements of ) existentialism within the very kind of 1) Chesterton, ‘War of the Gods and Demons’. Chesterton is referring to the war between Rome and Carthago, with Carthago and the worship of Baal or Moloch standing for absolute evil. Read-ing his description of Hannibal (“the Grace of Baal”) marching towards Rome, one realizes that it must have been among the direct inspirations for Tolkien’s picture of Mordor versus Minas Tirith in The Lord of the Rings (Chesterton’s influence on Tolkien and C.S. Lewis is well known), and his general description of Carthago and its Moloch cult looks like a direct model for Lovecraft ’s ancient civilization of the “Old Ones”, on which more below. 2) Eliade, ‘Cultural Fashions’, 8. 3) Eliade, ‘Cultural Fashions’, 10. 4) Eliade, ‘Cultural Fashions’, 10.

Lovecraft (1890-1937) and his reception by occultists since the 1960s. 2. Contre le monde, contre la vie Largely due to the influence of Pauwels and Bergier, who were fascinated by Lovecraft and published many of his stories in their magazine, Lovecraft ’s so-called “Cthulhu mythos” has come to play an important role in the esoteric imagination since the 1960s,5 as will be seen; but quite interestingly, it has proved no less fascinating to readers whose perspective could not be further removed from anything esoteric. As a particularly clear example, I will begin with the French writer Michel Houellebecq, whose 1991 essay on Lovecraft remains one of the most perceptive analyses of the man and his oeuvre. Houellebecq became famous as a novelist a few years later, and is now arguably the most successful (and controversial) writer in contemporary French literature.6 His 1991 essay is subtitled “Contre le Monde, Contre la Vie”, and emphasizes how Lovecraft ’s fiction is based upon his radical rejection of the world and of human life in general: He [Lovecraft ] finds the world disgusting, and he sees no reason to suppose that things might present themselves diff erently, by taking a better look at them. . . . Few persons have been so strongly impregnated, permeated to their very bones, by the absolute nullity of all human aspiration. The universe is but a furtive arrangement of elementary particles.7 A mere phase of transition towards chaos, which will finally engulf it: the human race will disappear. Other races will appear, and disappear in turn. The heavens will be glacial and empty, traversed only by the feeble light of half-dead stars. Which, too, will disap-pear. Everything will disappear. Human actions are as free and empty of meaning as the free movements of the elementary particles. Good, Evil, Morality, Feelings? Nothing but “victorian fictions”. Only egoism exists. Cold, intact, and brilliant.8 5) See Colavito, Cult of Alien Gods, 130ff . on the diff erences between the French and the American reception of Lovecraft ’s oeuvre. Of great importance for that French reception is the fascinating volume on H.P. Lovecraft published in the series “Cahiers de l’Herne” (Truchaud, H.P. Lovecraft ). Cf. furthermore the recent French collective volume H.P. Lovecraft (2002). 6) On Houellebecq, see the excellent study by van Wesemael, Michel Houellebecq, and id. (ed.), Michel Houellebecq.

Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109 The antecedents of this perspective are of course well-known. In a famous essay, Hans Jonas interpreted gnosticism as a predecessor of modern existentialism and nihilism, and mentioned Pascal as the first herald of existentialist Angst: ‘Cast into the infinite immensity of spaces that I do not know, and that do not know me, I am afraid . . .’ .9 No less evocative is Jonas’s quotation, in the same essay, from Nietzsche’s poem “Vereinsamt”: Die Welt—ein Tor zu tausend Wüsten stumm und kalt! Wer das verlor, was du verlorst, macht nirgends halt.10 Jonas argued that the existentialist experience of Geworfensein is essentially the same as the ancient gnostic experience of having been “thrown” into an alien and indiff erent world of blind matter, and therefore saw a direct connection between gnosticism and modern nihilism. The main weakness in his otherwise brilliant essay is that he interpreted the experience of alienation as the very essence of gnosticism, thereby ignoring the fact that whereas for the existentialist no escape is possible, the gnostics11 in fact believed that by means of a salvational gnosis they could overcome this world and return to their spiritual “homeland”. Lovecraft believed no such thing, nor did he play on spiritual beliefs in his fiction.12 Instead, by taking the existentialist/nihilist perspective one step further he lift ed Pascal’s fear to a new level, and in the process created a new kind of hor-ror fiction. In a way, this extra step could be seen as a reversal of the gnostic posi- 9) Pascal, Pensées, 68 (Lafuma ed.; = brunschvicq ed. 205), quoted in Jonas, ‘Epilogue’, 322 (the translation diff ers from mine). Pascal’s complete text reads: ‘Quand je considère la petite durée de ma vie, absorbée dans l’éternité précédant et suivant, le petit espace que je remplis et même que je vois, abîmé dans l’infinie immensité des espaces que j’ignore et qui m’ignorent, je m’eff raie et je m’étonne de me voir ici plutôt que là. Qui m’y a mis? Par l’ordre et la conduite de qui ce lieu et ce temps a-t-il été destiné à moi?’. Interestingly, Jacques Bergier, in his contribution to the Cahiers de l’Herne volume, quotes the same passage (Bergier, ‘H.P. Lovecraft ’, 122). 10) Nietzsche, “Vereinsamt”, quoted in Jonas, ‘Epilogue’, 324. The lines could be translated approx-imately as follows: ‘The world—a gate / to a thousand deserts mute and chill! / Who once has lost / what you have lost stands nowhere still’. 11) Here I do not go into the important question of whether, on the basis of current research, one may still speak about “the gnostics” at all (see notably Williams, Rethinking “Gnosticism”; King, What is Gnosticism?; and for a condensed discussion of the problem, cf. Hanegraaff , ‘Gnosticism’). 12) For a useful short overview of Lovecraft ’s philosophy, including his radical materialism and his rejection of ‘the primitive and irresponsible myth of “spirit”’ or immaterial soul and of any teleolog-ical concept’, see Joshi, A Subtler Magick, 29-50; cf. Joshi’s H.P. Lovecraft for a book-length discus-sion of Lovecraft ’s philosophy.

There may indeed be a “beyond”, but it has nothing to do with a spiritual realm of goodness, truth and beauty; on the contrary, behind the empty and meaningless world of material reality, there lurks something even worse. As for-mulated by Houellebecq: From his travels in the doubtful worlds of the unspeakable, Lovecraft did not return with good news. Yes, he tells us, perhaps something hides behind the veil of reality, and can sometimes be glimpsed. Something revolting, in fact. It is possible that beyond the limited domain of our perception, other entities exist. Other creatures, other races, other concepts and other intelligences. Among these enti-ties, some are probably much superior to us in terms of intelligence and knowledge. But that is not necessarily good news. What is it that makes us think that these creatures, so diff erent from us, have some kind of spiritual nature? There is no reason to assume a transgression of the universal laws of egoism and malice. It is ridiculous to imagine that, on the margins of the cosmos, beings full of wisdom and good will are waiting for us to guide us towards some kind of harmony.13 On the contrary. Lovecraft has begun several of his stories with programmatic statements about the essential horror behind the screen of the visible: Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of it peer daemo-niacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous.14 We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences . . . have hitherto harmed us little; but one day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revela-tion or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.15 Before taking a closer look at Lovecraft ’s Cthulhu mythos, let us note that we have now already touched upon no less than four diff erent perspectives: 1. An optimistic and holistic view of man “at home” in the universe, and actively participating in spiritual evolution, here mentioned with reference to Planète. 2. Pascal’s and Nietzsche’s pessimistic existentialist view of man’s homelessness in a wholly indifferent universe. 13) Houellebecq, H.P. Lovecraft , 19-20. 14) Lovecraft , ‘Arthur Jermyn’.

Lovecraft’s fiction, based on the suggestion that there is indeed such a “beyond”, but it is inhabited by a horrific world of unmitigated evil. By the end of this article, we will consider yet a fift h possibility. 3 . Lovecraft ’s Dream-Quest Contrary to many of his admirers, Lovecraft 16 was a radical materialist who saw all religions (including esotericism or occultism of any variety) as self-evident delusions. He does not ever seem to have been tempted to embrace any kind of religious or spiritual belief. On some level of his personality, however, he appears to have experienced the disenchantment of the world as deeply painful and dis-appointing, and in this regard it is interesting to first look at his sequence of “Randolph Carter” stories. This protagonist, in many ways an alter ego of Love-craft himself, is presented as an extraordinarily gift ed dreamer. “The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath” narrates Carter’s long and adventurous travels through the land of dreams, in desperate search of the secret that will enable him to enter the marvellous city he has beheld three times in his dreams, and which he can never forget. He finally reaches the castle of The Great Ones, ‘outside the ordered universe, where no dreams reach’, the place where abides the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffl ed, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed flutes; to which destable pounding and piping dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic Ultimate gods, blind, voiceless, tenebrous, mindless Other Gods whose soul and mes-senger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.17 When he finally meets Nyarlathotep face to face, he learns from him that his dream-city is nothing but ‘the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth’. To find it back, ‘you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood’.1816) The foremost modern Lovecraft specialist is S.T. Joshi. Among his many writings, see especially H.P. Lovecraft : A Life; A Subtler Magick; H.P. Lovecraft : The Decline of the West; and (ed., with David E. Schultz), Lord of a Visible World. 17) Lovecraft , ‘The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath’ (HPLO I, 365). 18) Ibid. (HPLO I, 484).

Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109 91 But it seems that Carter does not succeed, for in “The Silver Key” we read what happened to him years later:19 When Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams. Prior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly excursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely, unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age hardened upon him he felt those liberties slipping away little by little, until at last he was cut off altogether. . . . He had read too much of things as they are, and talked with too many people. Well-meaning philosophers had taught him to look into the logical relations of things, and analyze the processes which shaped his thoughts and fancies. Wonder had gone away, and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is no diff erence betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreaming, and no cause to value the one above the other. Custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly ashamed to dwell in visions. Wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and child-ish, and even more absurd because their actors persist in fancying them full of meaning and purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something and from something back to nothing again, neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or exis-tence of the minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darkness. Having lost the key, but not his desire to escape from everyday reality, Carter turns to the dark mysteries of the occult. “The Statement of Randolph Carter” (in fact an almost literal transcript of one of Lovecraft ’s own dreams)20 and “The Unnamable” refer to ‘weird studies’ of ‘strange, rare books on forbidden subjects’, nightly visits to graveyards and horrific encounters with unspeakable monsters. “The Silver Key” describes this period of his life in the most negative of terms: . . . he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace. Most of these, however, soon showed their poverty and barrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as dry and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem them.21 Finally, when Carter is fift y-two, his grandfather tells him in a dream about a silver key hidden in an antique box by one of his ancestors. He actually finds the 19) See Joshi, H.P. Lovecraft : A Life, 410 for this implied chronolog y: at the time of the “Dream-Quest” Carter is presumably in his twenties; at the beginning of “The Silver Key” he is thirty; aft er this follow the events described in “The Statement of Randolph Carter” and “The Unnamable”; and “The Silver Key” describes how he finds the key back at fift y-four. 20) Joshi, H.P.

What we find in the Randolph Carter sequence is a radical dualism between the enchanted world of dream, and the disenchanted world of reality; and hence the process of growing up is described as a painful process of disenchantment. While Lovecraft himself kept to the “adult” view of seeing dreams as illusionary, his alter ego describes the dream world as ultimately more real than mere “real-ity”. Hence it is not just that Lovecraft ’s fiction fulfills a role of “compensation” for the dreariness of everyday life; in addition, one of his main protagonists func-tions as a fictional compensation for his own positivist worldview, for Carter draws the conclusion that Lovecraft himself never drew in his own life: that ‘there is no diff erence betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreaming, and no cause to value the one above the other’. 4. The Cthulhu mythos Lovecraft ’s lasting fame is based not on his many fantasy stories set in an imaginary dreamworld, but on his stories of fantastic horror that unfold within a prosaic and naturalist setting. In most of these stories the main personality, always male and mostly solitary, discovers a glimpse of something that “should not exist”, and yet does. Lovecraft has repeatedly emphasized the centrality of such a radical break with the expected and imaginable: ‘the crux of a weird tale is something which could not possibly happen’.23 The sense of dread and horror results from ‘a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of umplumbed space’.24 The so-called “Cthulhu mythos” central to most of Lovecraft ’s mature horror fiction25 is based upon the idea that in very ancient times our earth was inhabited by a race (or several races) of intelligent beings who are utterly alien to anything 22) Ibid.

Note also that the term “Cthulhu mythos” was invented not by Lovecraft but by one of the members of the Lovecraft circle, August Derleth (see Harms, ‘H.P. Lovecraft and the Necronomicon’, 17).

Sometimes it is suggested that these beings, whose culture and civilization was highly developed and whose science was superior to ours, in fact created the human race by artificial genetic experiments, to provide them with slaves. In several of Lovecraft ’s stories, the protagonist discovers the remains of a gigantic city that was built by these mon-sters, and the final horror comes when he discovers that they are not dead. In other stories, it becomes clear that these monstrous beings did not originate here on earth, but have arrived from far-away stars, being able to survive in interstellar space: The blasphemies which appeared on earth, it was hinted, came from the dark planet Yug-goth, at the rim of the solar system; but this was itself merely the populous outpost of a frightful interstellar race whose ultimate source must lie far outside even the Einsteinian space-time continuum or greatest known cosmos. . . . The main body of the beings inhabits strangely organized abysses wholly beyond the utmost reach of any human imagination. The space-time globule which we recognize as the totality of all cosmic entity is only an atom in the genuine infinity which is theirs. . . . There are mighty cities on Yuggoth . . . The sun shines there no brighter than a star, but the beings need no light. . . . Light even hurts and hampers and confuses them, for it does not exist at all in the black cosmos outside time and space where they came from originally.26 The beings are oft en described as “fungous”, even as regards their means of repro-duction; and they were able to invade our world by traversing interstellar space in the form of spores.27 They lived on earth in ancient times; they are still lurking in secret places; and they are waiting for their chance to return to earth, ‘when the stars are right’, and regain their former dominion. In many of Lovecraft ’s stories, the protagonist discovers horrific “blasphemous cults” of human beings who worship the “Great Old Ones” as their gods and are secretly preparing their return; and in stories like “The Dunwich Horror” or “The Case of Charles 26) Lovecraft , ‘The Whisperer in Darkness’ (HPLO 3, 179-180, 196, 213).27) Cf. Lovecraft ’s long poem ‘Fungi from Yuggoth’, and see e.g. ‘At the Mountains of Madness’: ‘The beings multiplied by means of spores . . . but, owing to their prodigious toughness and longev-ity, and consequent lack of replacement needs, they did not encourage the large-scale development of new protophallia except when they had new regions to colonize’ (HPLO I, 87; and cf. ‘The Whisperer in Darkness’, HPLO III, 195, 217). The idea seems to have originated with Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius’ theory of panspermia, first proposed by him in 1907, and was taken up by Olaf Stapledon in his science fiction novel Last and First Men (1930), from where Lovecraft could have picked it up (I wish to thank Matthew Rogers for this information). Psychedelic author Terence McKenna could be indebted to either Stapledon or Lovecraft for his notorious idea that psychedelic mushrooms have their origin beyond our solar system, having arrived here by means of spores that have traveled through space.

If succesful, it is implied, they will unleash a reign of horror too terrible to imagine. Information about these demonic beings and about how to invoke them is available in a number of rare “forbidden books”, the contents of which are so shocking that people have gone insane merely by reading them. Among the many titles mentioned by Lovecraft we find quite some books that actually exist (e.g. witchcraft manuals such as Joseph Glanvil’s Saduscismus Triumphatus or Nicolas Remy’s Daemonolatreia), but these are mixed with invented titles including Lud-wig Prinn’s De Vermis Mysteriis, von Juntz’s Unaussprechlichen Kulten, and of course the most famous one by far: the Necronomicon written by the mad poet Abdul Alhazred.28 As is well known, many readers over the years have refused to believe that the Necronomicon was invented by Lovecraft , insisting instead that he must have been revealing occult truths under the guise of fiction; others have played upon and amplified such beliefs by creating intentional mystifications (for example by publishing book reviews of the Necronomicon); and over the years, quite an amazing number of Necronomicons have been written and published.29 Finally, among the most fascinating aspects of the Cthulhu mythos is its pan-theon of nightmarish demonic beings, somehow representative of the “Great Old Ones” or equivalent races described in the novels.30 Most frequently men-tioned are Shub-Niggurath (‘the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young’), the “crawling chaos” Nyarlathotep, the daemon sultan Azathoth, Yog-sothoth (the ‘key and guardian of the gate’ through which the “Great Ones” broke through to our world), the toad-like Tsathoggua, and of course “great Cthulhu” himself.31 As could be expected, there have been many attempts to give 28) According to the Lovecraft ian mythos, Abdul Alhazred died in 738 in Damascus (devoured alive in broad daylight by an invisible monster), and his book was originally titled Al Azif. It was translated into Greek by a Byzantine scholar known as Theodorus Philetas in 950, and from Greek into latin by Olaus Wormius in 1228. 29) On the details of this phenomenon, see Harms & Gonce, Necronomicon Files. 30) To my knowledge, the relation of these “demons” or “gods” to the great mass of monsters that have lived and are still living on earth is never really clarified by Lovecraft . The monsters in general are venerated as “gods” by certain secret cults, but the beings specifically mentioned by name would seem to have a special status. 31) The Wikipedia internet encylopedia is particularly useful for information about all these enti-ties: the entries are clearly all written by the same author, and provide excellent overviews of how these beings are described by Lovecraft , with references to the relevant stories and passages.

Thus, in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith, Lovecraft speaks with a mixture of amusement and irritation about a marginal member of the Lovecraft circle, William Lumley: He is firmly convinced that all our gang . . . are genuine agents of unseen Powers in distrib-uting hints too dark and profound for human conception or comprehension . . . Indeed—Bill tells me that he has fully identified my Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep . . . so that he can tell me more about ’em than I know myself.32 Clearly Lovecraft found this ridiculous, and he would have been amazed (and probably worried) to see how many occultists would come to hold similar views especially from the 1960s on. The extent of Lovecraft ’s familiarity with Western esoteric traditions is a somewhat controversial issue among specialists. John Wisdom Gonce III, to whom we owe the most thorough discussion to date, argues that while Love-craft ’s knowledge of esotericism was certainly much more limited and superficial than imagined by some of his occultist admirers,33 yet it was more serious than one would conclude from authoritative specialists like S.T. Joshi. Apart from a simple lack of familiarity with the field, these scholars tend to underestimate the importance of esotericism, firstly because they personally share Lovecraft ’s mechanistic/materialist worldview34 and have trouble perceiving “the occult” as something that should be given much weight, and secondly because too much emphasis on the occult might throw an unfavourable light on Lovecraft and thus work against their agenda of getting him recognized as one of the great American 32) Lovecraft , Selected Letters IV, 271, as quoted in John Wisdom Gonce III, ‘Lovecraft ian Magick: Sources and Heirs’, in: Harms & Gonce, Necronomicon Files, 99. 33) Similar conclusions are drawn by Menegaldo, ‘Le méta-discours ésotériste’. Note that Gonce speaks of “the occult” rather than “esotericism”. 34) Joshi is in fact a militant atheist and skeptic: see his God’s Defenders, which includes a chapter on G.K. Chesterton, whose name is absent from Joshi’s books on Lovecraft . ARIES 7,1_f6_84-109.indd 95ARIES 7,1_f6_84-109.indd 951/17/07 1:55:40 PM1/17/07 1:55:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"96 W.

Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109authors of the 20th century.35 A further problem in evaluating Lovecraft ’s debt to esotericism is the fact that he may well have been the most prolific letter-writer in history (estimates of his total output run between 75.000 and 100.000 pieces of correspondence), and nobody has an even remotely complete overview of all his correspondence.36 Taking into account these limitations, Gonce provides us with a list of main influences on Lovecraft regarding “the occult”: The Arabian Nights—which he first read as a child, and which kept fascinating him throughout his life—provided him with many stories of medieval Islamic magic; from an early age he was fascinated by the pantheon of classical mytholog y; among contemporary writers with occult interests who influenced him are Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen, Sax Rohmer, and various author asociated with French Deca-dent literature, such as J.K. Huysmans; much information about “primitive magic” and witchcraft he took straight from E.B. Tylor’s articles on magic and demonolog y in the 9th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, J.G. Frazer’s Golden Bough, and Margaret Murray’s Witch-Cult in Western Europe; and among the esotericists, occultists and historians of magic and demonolog y with whom he was somewhat familiar are notably Eliphas Levi, Montague Summers, Grillot de Givry, Lewis Spence, A.E. Waite, H.P. Blavatsky, Scott-Elliot, Nicholas Roerich, and Aleister Crowley.37 Many other authors relevant to esotericism are mentioned here and there in his stories, but mostly these are clearly just cases of name-dropping. One of the best examples is “The Case of Charles Dexter Ward”, where we learn how the library of Ward’s sinister ancestor Joseph Curwen was described by a visitor: Mr Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemi-cal, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to 35) Gonce, ‘Lovecraft ian Magick’, 85-86. Joshi’s 708-page biography of Lovecraft is extremely thor-ough and detailed, but Gonce notes that nevertheless, ‘in spite of all his careful research, Joshi over-looks Lovecraft ’s letter to Clark Ashton Smith asking for source material on the occult, and ignores his subsequent studies of historic grimoires . . . In the same book, Joshi devotes three pages to the theft of Lovecraft ’s suits from his New York apartment!’ 36) As explained by Gonce (‘Lovecraft ian Magick’, 87), only a small percentage of his letters has survived, even less of them have been published, the five published volumes of Selected Letters have been heavily abridged and censored by August Derleth, and most manuscript letters are spread over a variety of university and private libraries. 37) But although many occultists since the 1960s have seen Crowley and Lovecraft as closely related, in fact Lovecraft seems to quote him only very rarely: Menegaldo found no more than a single refer-ence in a letter (Menegaldo, ‘Méta-discours ésotériste’, 266 nt 12).

In an earlier article published in Aries I argued that our perception of Western esotericism as a more or less coherent tradition is in fact the historical result of what I call the “Grand Polemical Narrative” of Western culture.39 Starting with the invention of monotheism, and continuing through Christianity and the Enlightenment, Western culture has been defining its own identity by creating an imaginary domain of the demonized “other” that repre-sents and contains everything “we” consider unacceptable and incompatible with our own basic values. The construction of identity always takes places ‘by means of telling stories—to ourselves and to others—of who, what and how we want to be’;40 and such stories can only be told by simultaneously construing an “other” who represents whatever we do not want to be. In other words, the con-cept of “Western esotericism” is itself a fictional product, and must not be confused with the reality of the historical currents associated with it. By the 18th century, the long cumulative process in which Western culture had been construing and re-construing its complementary “other” had resulted in the exis-tence of a space in the collective imagination that contained everything we now-adays associate with the field of “Western esotericism”: this is where modernity vaguely but consistently locates a variety of “pagan superstitions”; the entire domain of witchcraft and demonolog y; heresies like gnosticism; occult sciences like astrolog y, alchemy and magic; the mystical speculations of theosophical and kabbalistic hermeneutics; the “enthusiasm” of “irrational cults”; and various real or imagined “hidden traditions” or secret societies inspired by and connected 38) Lovecraft , ‘The Case of Charles Dexter Ward’ (HPLO 1, 160-161). 39) Hanegraaff , ‘Forbidden Knowledge’. 40) Hanegraaff , ‘Forbidden Knowledge’, 226.

Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109with such ideas.41 This entire domain in the collective imagination is clearly a fictional product: any historian of Western esotericism knows how far the his-torical reality of all these various currents is removed from how they appear in the popular imagination. It is from this very reservoir of “the other” in the collective imagination of Western culture, and of Enlightenment culture more in particular, that Love-craft drew his basic materials. All his stories linked to the Cthulhu mythos rely for their eff ect on the presence in the reader’s mind of obscure chains of associa-tion grounded in the Grand Polemical Narrative. The “unspeakable” monsters, and the rituals in which they are venerated and invoked, are constantly referred to as “abominations” and as “blasphemous”, “unholy”, “unhallowed” or “godless”: terms that do not presuppose any religious belief on the part of the author or the reader, but are eff ective simply because they invoke the feelings of horror inspired by pagan deities and demonic beings in the minds of traditional Christian doc-trine.42 The same goes for various other “esoteric” elements: in the above quota-tion from “The Case of Charles Dexter Ward”, the mere spectacle of “occult” books, filled with “forbidden” secrets, and involved in “dark” traditions such as magic or alchemy, is enough to inspire feelings of fear and “loathing”. Lovecraft plays upon popular perceptions of such domains, but raises them to an extreme degree: whereas some conservative Christians might feel uncomfortable and even somewhat afraid in being confronted with “occult” grimoires, the charac-ters in Lovecraft ’s stories go literally insane merely by leafing through the Necro-nomicon, and while missionaries or explorers might react to “pagan”, “superstitious”, “primitive” or “barbarous” rituals with feelings of revulsion and disgust, those who behold the Cthulhu rituals in Lovecraft ’s stories are touched to the very core of their being by the “unspeakable” horror of it all. 41) Cf. Hanegraaff , ‘The Study of Western Esotericism’, 513; and idem, ‘Magic V’, 741, on Western esotericism as a “waste-basket” category in which scholars in the wake of the Enlightenment dumped everything that did not fit the relatively neat categories of “religion” and “science”. And see idem, New Age Religion, 382 for some examples of how concerned scholars imagine this dangerous “other”: Christoph Schorsch discussed New Age as ‘die Rückkehr zum Dunkel der eingeschränkten Bewusstheit, zum muffigen Dünkel spiritistischer Ratifikationen und zur undurchdringlichen Nacht, in der die Gespenster umgehen’ (o.c., 223) and Gottfried Kuënzlen ‘kann und will es nicht glauben, dass ein gnostisch-esoterischer Verschnitt, dass Okkultismus, ja Obskurantismus, dass heidnisch-magische Versatzstücke, dass wabernde Mythologismen als neuen Kulturmuster öff entli-che Kraft gewinnen’ (o.c., 38). Such statements go back to the mid-1980s and I am cautiously opti-mistic that nowadays most scholars will find them merely amusing. 42) Chesterton’s picture of Baal worship in the chapter from which I took the quotation above this article, is a case in point.

Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109 99 Not only does Lovecraft play upon the various “others” of monotheism and Christianity (paganism, magic, demonolog y, witchcraft and so on), he does the same with those of modern rationality and science. The “alterity” of the mon-sters and what they stand for is raised to an extreme degree by a systematic emphasis on its complete und utter incompatibility with anything known by means of the senses or reason, understandable by logic, or expressible in discur-sive language. Thus in “The Colour Out of Space”, a spot of land is infected by an alien influence that makes its presence felt, among other things, by a colour ‘unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum’: it was ‘almost impossible to describe; and it was only by analog y that they called it colour at all’.43 In various stories we hear that the aliens emit a stench that defies description but inspires an unspeakable horror. Elsewhere, the “alien” and “unnatural” nature of the horror derives from a radical transgression of geometry. Thus in “The Call of Cthulhu”, we hear of a geometry that is ‘abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redo-lent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours’;44 and particularly strong exam-ples are found throughout “The Dreams in the Witch-House”, where we read about ‘lines and curves that could be made to point out directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond’, and even about ‘alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos’.45 And finally, there is the chilling eff ect of “barbarous” and almost unpronouncable words: Ph’ng lui mg lw ’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fh tagn46 Ygnaiih . . . yhnaiih . . . thflthkh’ngha . . .

Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109 Some scholars might be tempted to draw parallels here with the “barbarous names” and apparently meaningless strings of vowels known from mystical litur-gies and magical formulas of late antiquity, but my point here is another one: if discursive language stands for rational, civilized discourse and communication, “unspeakable” words spoken by intelligent beings evoke associations with the sub-human, barbarous, archaic, irrational and demonic “other”. In this instance too, Lovecraft succeeds in creating horror eff ects by drawing from the popular “imaginary” of the occult as created by the Grand Polemical Narrative. 6. Lovecraft ian Chaos Magick At the time of his death, Lovecraft was unknown to the general public, and admired only in a small circle of readers and fellow-authors. But from the 1960s on, and largely in the wake of Pauwels and Bergier’s publications, not only did he become one of the most influential writers of horror literature, but he also laid the foundations for a range of new developments in popular culture, occultism, and alternative spirituality. To understand this latter phenomenon, it is essential to emphasize (in contrast to Eliade’s interpretation referred to above) the conti-nuity of existentialist/nihilist perspectives within the countercultures repre-sented by a journal like Planète. It seems to me that Houellebecq has, again, noted the essential here. Having described Lovecraft ’s cosmos—ruled by fear and malice, populated by monstrous beings, and without even the tiniest suggestion of anything moral or good, let alone spiritual—he writes: For us as people of the end of the 20th century, this cosmos without hope is absolutely our own one. This abject universe, where fear is piled up in concentric circles up to the unnameable revelation, this universe where our only imaginable destiny is that of being pulverized and devoured—we recognize it absolutely as our own mental universe. But the paradox is that we prefer this universe, hideous as it may be, over our reality. . . . Satan or Nyarlathothep, whatever—but we cannot stand one more minute of realism. And frankly, Satan has become a bit devalued by his endless connections with the shame-ful detours of our ordinary sins. Compare that with Nyarlathothep: cold, evil and inhu-man as ice. Subb-haqqua Nyarlathothep!49 When Houellebecq calls Lovecraft ’s cosmos and mental universe ‘our own one’, of course he means that, at the very least, it is his one: all his own novels are per-meated by the same extreme spiritual desolation and hopelessness which he 49) Houellebecq, H.P.

Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109 101highlights in Lovecraft . Nevertheless, it seems to me that he is essentially right in how he explains the core reason of Lovecraft ’s popular appeal. In his own novels, Houellebecq shows with merciless precision how and why the day-to-day “real-ity” of his protagonists becomes so empty of any meaning and purpose as to be virtually unbearable. Imprisoned within a wholly impersonal and inhuman sys-tem of global economics—a “social” reality as blind and indiff erent as Pascal’s cosmos—, his protagonists are desperately looking for “the possibility of an island”:50 something , anything , that will provide them a momentary refuge from “reality” (including that of their own egoism and lovelessness). Houellebecq’s “islands” are mostly erotic, whereas Lovecraft ’s are located in dreams and the imagination, but their foundation is the same. I would argue that post-1960s occultist appropriations of Lovecraft , known as “Lovecraft ian magick”, have this same foundation as well: these particular types of contemporary esotericism are not really based upon the ‘optimistic and holis-tic’ outlook described by Eliade in his article of 1976, but are much closer to an “existentialist” and nihilist perspective that has given up on finding any deeper “meaning”, “truth” or “purpose” in either material or social reality, and therefore looks to the imagination as the only remaining refuge or route of escape.51 Inter-estingly, we will see that on the basis of this dualism of reality versus imagination, these Lovecraft ian occultists develop a perspective that is neither gnostic in a traditional sense (i.e., based on the dualism of our material world against a spiri-tual world of harmony and light), nor fully in line with Lovecraft ’s fictional con-cept of the dualism between ‘the normal human world and the infested Outside’52 (i.e., neither option 3 nor 4 of the list on page 89, above). The phenomenon of “Lovecraft ian Magick” appears to have originated in 1972, as a result of two books published in that year: The Magical Revival by Kenneth Grant, and The Satanic Rituals by Anton LaVey, which could be seen as representing its theoretical and its practical side respectively. It was Grant who 50) Thus the title of Houellebecq’s latest novel. 51) Such an interpretation does not need to carry pejorative connotations, for reasons eloquently formulated by J.R.R. Tolkien. R.J. Reilly discusses the issue of “escapism” in his wonderful (and strangely forgotten) study of Tolkien and the other “inklings”, and describes how the English author responded to those who criticize fantasy literature as “escapist”. Tolkien refused to interpret “escape” as a bad thing : ‘The word, he thinks, has fallen into disrepute because its users too oft en confuse “the Escape of the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter”: Why should a man be scorned, if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it’ (Tolkien, ‘On Fairy-Stories’, 79, as quoted in Reilly, Romantic Religion, 207). 52) As felicitously formulated by Davis, ‘Calling Cthulhu’, 61.

Specialists agree that the “grandfather” of Chaos Magick was the English art-ist and occultist Austin Osman Spare (1886-1956), whose ‘hardcore Surrealist theurg y’56 sought to access the powers of the subconscious mind by means of transgressive sexual and mind-altering techniques, and laid the foundations of what has been called a “postmodern shamanism”.57 Contemporary Chaos Magick, popularized in particular by Peter J. Carroll’s Liber Null and Psychonaut of 1987, is based upon a radical rebellion against ‘the tyranny of reason and its ordered universe’,58 and against the dualisms of all traditional systems of morality in general. Chaos magicians advocate a radical epistemological and moral relativism.

The occultist traditions of modernity are no exception to the deconstructivist/postmodernist maxim that ‘all systems of knowledge are socially constructed and culturally biased’, so that ‘no one belief is more true than any other’;60 hence, Chaos Magick’s interior logic ‘creatively erodes the distinction between legitimate esoteric trans-mission and total fiction’:61 For today’s Chaos mages, there is no “tradition”. The symbols and myths of countless sects, orders, and faiths, are constructs, useful fictions, “games”. That magic works has nothing to do with its truth claims and everything to do with the will and experience of the magician. Recognizing the distinct possibility that we may be adrift in a meanin g less mech-anical cosmos within which human will and imagination are vaguely comic flukes . . . the mage accepts his groundlessness, embracing the chaotic self-creating void that is himself.62 Against such a background, the radical refusal to distinguish between fiction and reality makes it possible for Chaos magicians to invoke, and allow them-selves to be possessed by, demons and deities that they know have been invented by Lovecraft : the objection “they don’t exist, for Lovecraft made them up” has no power, for it presupposes the very distinction they reject. A preference for pre-cisely the kinds of beings described by Lovecraft —entities that have come from other-dimensional ‘spaces between the stars’—fits very well with the importance to Chaos Magick of Spare’s concept of “Kia”, described as “the space between the worlds”, or the “neither-neither” realm beyond the duality of objectivity and sub-jectivity (and hence beyond the duality of fiction and reality as well).63 Rituals of Lovecraft ian Chaos Magick use any transgressive technique available to allow Kia to manifest itself, including drumming, chanting, psychoactive drugs, sexual techniques, and the emotional arousal created by contemplating ‘horrific or gro-tesque imagery’.64 60) Houston, ‘Chaos Magic’, 55. 61) Davis, ‘Calling Cthulhu’, 61. 62) Davis, ‘Calling Cthulhu’, 59. 63) Davis, ‘Calling Cthulhu’, 56.

At the occasion of the fourth ritual, the members met at night in a woodland area north of London, and dressed in black robes.

You may serve me by being what is truest to you, by doing your truest nature, your truest will. Finding that for yourself, you may serve me.72 Frankly, the ritual conversation is mildy amusing. The horrible, unspeakable, unnamable, blasphemous “abomination” Shub Niggurath of Lovecraft ’s fiction seems to have turned into a soft and Romantic pagan nature god (‘my will is the sound of the trees, of the rivers . . . ’), who apparently cannot think of anything really shocking or transgressive to ask from his devotees, and therefore merely repeats the most obvious of all things in this context: Crowley’s maxim “do what thou wilt”. As if the Haunters could not have thought of that themselves. Even more disappointing is Nyarlathothep’s New Ageish advice in another ritual quoted by Woodman: ‘Seek for me within’.73 One cannot help being reminded of Tanya Luhrmann’s remarks about the Chaos Magicians she met in London: ‘They reminded me of boys boasting of wild sexual exploits: far too well behaved and nervous to kiss a girl they claimed they should have raped’.74 Far more interesting than the rituals themselves is the countercultural philos-ophy behind them, which reflects a radical rejection of “the world” and every-thing it stands for. Still, here too, one detects a strong nuance of Romanticism completely absent from Lovecraft himself, or from contemporary Lovecraft ian nihilists like Houellebecq. In describing his Chaos Magicians, Woodman speaks of ‘the incursions of chaos—the violation of established cultural codes and cate-gories’, radical threats to ‘our entire system of thought and, by implication, the society which generates it’, and the need ‘to embrace madness as a radical meta-morphosis of awareness’ that ‘confers total autonomy from the values and judge-ments of society at large’;75 but he also notes that In contrast to Lovecraft ’s bleak nihilism, the group held that . . . an “apocalypse” [of con-sciousness] would force the human species to abandon its petty moral, ethnic, religious 72) Woodman, ‘Alien Selves’, 22. 73) Woodman, ‘Alien Selves’, 23 (emphasis in original). 74) Luhrmann, Persuasions of the Witch’s Craft , 97. 75) Woodman, ‘Alien Selves’, 26-27.

In other words: in spite of all the talk of radical epistemological relativism, “embracing darkness” and chaos, and transgressing all moral and societal norms and values, these Chaos Magicians seem to hold at least some beliefs about a possible future evolution of consciousness that will transform society and create a “better” world. 7. Conclusion: Fiction and Contemporary Nihilism Does this mean that Eliade was right aft er all? Does even the “dark” phenome-non of Chaos Magick belong on the side of the ‘optimistic and holistic’ counter-culture, over against the existentialist nihilism of Lovecraft himself or contemporaries like Houellebecq? Rather, it seems to me that if we attempt to apply such distinctions too radically and consistently, we find that they break down: radical pessimism is possible neither logically nor psychologically with-out at least a remnant of optimism, and the reverse. It is more useful to think in terms of a scale of gradations between two theoretical polarities. To put the atti-tudes of Chaos Magicians, Lovecraft , and even Houellebecq in perspective, it may be useful to compare them to the truly radical nihilism represented by Nietzsche’s “last man”: ‘Wehe! Es kommt die Zeit, wo der Mensch keinen Stern mehr gebären wird. Wehe! Es kommt die Zeit des verächtlichsten Menschen, der sich selber nicht mehr verachten kann. Seht! Ich zeige euch den letzten Menschen. “Was ist Liebe? Was ist Schöpfung ? Was ist Sehnsucht? Was ist Stern?”—so fragt der letzte Mensch und blinzelt. Die Erde ist dann klein geworden, und auf ihr hüpft der letzte Mensch, der Alles klein macht. Sein Geschlecht ist unaustilgbar, wie der Erdfloh; der letzte Mensch lebt am längsten. “Wir haben das Glück erfunden”—sagen die letzten Menschen und blinzeln’.77 76) Woodman, ‘Alien Selves’, 24. 77) Friedrich Nietzsche, Also Sprach Zarathustra (‘Woe!

J. Hanegraaff / Aries 7 (2007) 85-109 107 Houellebecq is the only one among those we have discussed, who comes somewhat close to what Nietzsche describes here. Most of Houellebecq’s pro-tagonists (including, I am convinced, Houellebecq himself ) are deeply Roman-tic nihilists, who suff er because they desperately want to find something to love. It is only in his most recent novel, The Possibility of an Island, that we actually do encounter Nietzsche’s last man: a future race of clones, genetically created to be happy and live forever. They suff er no pain or discomfort and are living what looks like a life without any purpose or direction; but they are not conscious of being unhappy, for the very concept of meaning is alien to them. Interestingly, there is a Lovecraft ian connection here as well: in Houellebecq’s novel, the breakthrough to genetic immortality is made by a scientistic sect called the Elohim, and based upon the UFO religion of the Raelians: a radically non- metaphysical and scientistic new religious movement whose belief that human-ity itself was artificially created by aliens happens to have its ultimate origins in . . . Lovecraft ’s fiction.78 Provided that we look at oppositions such as optimism versus pessimism or world-affirmation versus world-rejection in terms of polarities rather than strict dualisms, we may conclude that the popularity of Lovecraft in modern and contemporary esoteric/occultist contexts reflects not a sunny, optimistic and holistic belief in a meaningful evolutionary universe, but an apparently widely-felt sense of nihilism, world-rejection and profound pessimism about what in the popular movie The Matrix is called “the desert of the real”:79 consciously or not, Lovecraft ian magick is ultimately rooted in Houellebecqian soil. In all the cases discussed in this article we are dealing with a Romantic nihilism, which finds a contempt for himself. / See! I show you the last man. / “What is Love? What is creation? What is nostalgia? What is star?”—thus the last man asks, and blinks. / The earth then will have become small, and on it there hops around the last man, who makes everything small. His race is inex-terminable, like fleas; the last man lives longest. / “We have invented happiness” the last men say, and blink’). 78) About Lovecraft as the origin of the so-called “ancient astronaut theory” (associated with Erich von Däniken and a whole range of similar authors), see Colavito, Cult of Alien Gods, which also shows how Pauwels and Bergier served as the crucial mediating link. About the Raelians, see Palmer, Aliens Adored. Interestingly, although in Houellebecq’s novel the religion’s leader is killed and his “resurrection” as a clone is described as a hoax, the Raelians appear to appreciate the largely sympa-thetic way their religion is portrayed (in sharp contrast with the anti-cult perspective of the French media) (Schofield, ‘Cult backs New Houellebecq Novel’). 79) The directors of The Matrix adopted the formulation from Jean Baudrillard’s essay “Simulacra and Simulations”. There now exists a small library of studies about the philosophical backgrounds of The Matrix. For an excellent discussion of its “gnostic” character, see Flannery-Dailey & Wagner, ‘Wake Up!’.

The significance, from such a perspective, of “imaginary worlds”—such as virtual realities, fantasy role playing games, or psychonautic traveling—in popular occulture requires much more research than is currently available, and might teach us something significant about contemporary society in general.80 Love-craft ’s Cthulhu mythos would be an excellent focus of such research.
