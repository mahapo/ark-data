[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 33Shadow over Philistia:A review of the Cult ofDagonJohn C. DayThrough the centuries, pantheistic deities have often been assimilatedinto different religious systems, a classic example being that of theGreek and Roman pantheons. With the advent of extensive occultactivity at the turn of the nineteenth century, initiated by such individuals asH.P. Blavatsky and Aleister Crowley, a number of pantheistic deities werereintroduced into European minds and actively incorporated into magicalacts. It is often impossible to identify key events leading to the integrationof a deity into the religious framework of a society, or the evolution a deityhas undergone to perpetuate its own existence. Here is presented a possibleexception, that of the deity Dagon. Although primarily regarded as a Philistinegod, Dagon was assimilated into their religious practices but moreimportantly has re-emerged as a key archetype in what has been describedas the Cthulhu mythos.This essay aims to examine the historical evidence surrounding the worshipof Dagon in biblical times and, following the demise of the cult of Dagon,explore its influence on twentieth century writing and esotericism. Fromthis body of work has emerged a mythos of Elder Gods from, what hasbeen described as, the ‘preeval aeons’ - of which Dagon as a god of the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"34 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1Deep has been attributed. This mythos has been employed as a foundationfor the current manifestation of the Cult of Dagon and herein is present asummary of the history of the Order and its current position in the UK.The Early History of the Cult of DagonDagon (} w g d)1 is most frequently described as one of the chief deities ofthe Philistines, although worship appears to have been extensive, for Dagonappears in a number of geographical place names beyond the Philistinecountry.2 It has been claimed that the god Dagon originally belonged to aprehistoric and pre-Semitic people of the Upper Mesopotamia as the namewas probably derived from Dagan. Dagan is a West-Semitic god, probablyof Amorite origins and evidence for the cult of Dagan begins in the thirdmillenium Mesopotamia, continuing for nearly two thousand years.3In the Bible the god Dagon is mention three times: firstly in Judges 16:23where a great sacrifice to Dagon was made by the Philistine lords; secondlyin 1 Chronicles 10;10 where is described the placement of Saul’s head inthe temple of Dagon; and thirdly the story in 1 Samuel 5 where Dagon isconfronted with the Ark. From these biblical texts it can be establishedthat the worship of Dagon among the Philistines appears to have beencarried out with a highly developed and elaborate ritual, possibly involvinghuman sacrifice.It is commonly held that the name Dagon is derived from the Semitic rootdag (g dg dg dg dg d), and means, accordingly, ‘fish’, and thus Dagon appears to havebeen worshipped in the form of a fish-shaped god. This is supported in theBible by an account of Dagon worshipped in the temple of Azotus, ‘he hadface and hands and a portion of his body resembled that of a fish’, inaccordance with the most probable interpretation of ‘the stump of Dagon’.4In the Septuagint (LXX),5 it is suggested Dagon possessed feet, leadingsome scholars to infer that Dagon could not possibly be a fish deity.6However, it is not inconsistent with the representation of Dagon asichthyomorphic, as pictures of a fish god show human face and hands, andin some examples, legs, on Mesopotamian cylinders and other monuments.7"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 35Certain coins of various Philistine or Phoenician cities support the descriptionpresented in the Bible, where Dagon is represented as a composite figure,with a human upper body and a fish-like lower body.8 From this it maywell be inferred that Dagon was a fish-god. Furthermore, he seems tohave been the primary deity of such maritime cities as Azotus, Gaza (theearly sites of which are supposed to be buried under the sand-mounds thatrun along the sea-shore), Ascalon, and Arvad. This has led to the suggestionthat, with such a maritime history, it would be natural for the Philistines toconnect their main god with a fish.9However, another school of thought considers Dagon to be an avatar ofagriculture. This opinion they rest upon the writings of Philo of Byblos whoattributes Dagon with corn and discovering the plough. Philo lived at theend of the first and the beginning of the second century A.D. and claimedto have translated from Phoenician into Greek the work of Sanchuniathon.He further tells us (in Eusebius, Praep. Evang., I,6) that according to anancient Phoenician legend, Dagon was one of four sons born of the marriageof the lord of heaven, Anu, with his sister, the earth. Philo identifies El, themost common Babylonian-Syrian-Arabian name for God and the supremedeity of the Canaanites, with Kronos in his account of Phoenician mythology.However, in the Etymologicum Magnum, Dagon is identified as thePhoenician Kronos, supported by Ugaritic sources that corresponds Dagonwith Kumarbi, the Hurrian Kronos.10Philo goes on to characterise Poseidon explicitly as the god of Beirut whilsta Palmyrene inscription identifies El with Poseidon.11 Lipinski12 poses thequestion ‘if Kronos corresponds to the old Semitic god Dagon, whilePoseidon is identical with El, why did Philo then distort these traditionalidentifications and identify El with Kronos? Lipinski fails to offer asatisfactory answer. However, a suitable answer can be found if El isidentified with Dagon as proposed by Joseph Fontenrose.13 Thus, if Dagonis El, both are identified with Kronos, and subsequently Dagon can beidentified with Poseidon enforcing the association as Gods of the Deep."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"36 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1Dagon and literature: HP Lovecraft and the CthulhuMythosAlthough mostly attributed with the biblical texts, Dagon makes a numberof appearances in English literature through history, with references to thePhilistine God ranging from the works of Milton (1608-1674)14 to HerbertGorman’s The Place Called Dagon.15 Other than in the Bible the mostdramatic and influential depiction of Dagon can be found in the works ofH.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s literary reputation rests on a very small bodyof work, consisting of around sixty short stories that have been placedalongside the works of Edgar Allen Poe and Arthur Machen. These storiesare interwoven with a complex body of ancient, monstrous mythology thatLovecraft manifested in his writings, composed of destructive deities fromstrange realms clambering to find egress to our world. These gods arecollectively known as the Cthulhu mythos.Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, at his familyhome in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. Lovecraft was a precociousyouth, reciting poetry at age two, reading by the age three, and writingstories by the age six or seven. His earliest enthusiasm was for the ArabianNights, which he read by the age of five; it was at this time that he adaptedthe pseudonym of ‘Abdul Alhazred,’ who later became the author of themythical Necronomicon in Lovecraft’s published stories. From 1908 to1913 Lovecraft was a virtual hermit, doing little save pursuing hisastronomical interests and his poetry writing. It was in the amateur worldof ‘pulp’ magazines that Lovecraft recommenced the writing of fiction,which he had abandoned in 1908. Friends, noting the promise shown in hisearly tales, urged Lovecraft to begin writing fiction once more and this hedid. One of the first pieces produced was that of Dagon16 a story set in astrange nightmare landscape ‘putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish’.Dagon was partly inspired by Lovecraft’s dreams and openly describeshis own plight in the dream: ‘He pulls himself along in the detestable ooze,tenaciously though it clings to him. I know, for I dreamed that whole hideouscrawl, and yet feel the ooze sucking me down!’.17 It is interesting to notethat Lovecraft also had a deep disgust of eating seafood.18 From the texts"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 37of certain ancient writers it can be found that for religious reasons most ofthe Syrian peoples also abstained from eating fish, possibly in order toappease a fish deity.Dagon again appears in a second story by Lovecraft called Shadow OverInnsmouth.19 In this tale Lovecraft envisioned a cult devoted to an ancientsea-god. The members of the Cult of Dagon interbreed with sea creaturesresulting in an amphibian chimera born human in appearance but graduallybecome more fishlike over time, eventually retiring to the ocean fully formed.It is interesting to compare these avatars of Dagon with an interpretation ofthe Septuagint. One of the arguments against the depiction of Dagon as afish god is based upon the description in I Samuel 5.4 of the SeptuagintLXX that describes Dagon with both arms and legs.20 Fonterose13 interpretsthis depiction to mean Dagon’s human members fell away and only hisfish-body remained, thus revealing him for what he was, a fish. It appearsthat Lovecraft thought along these lines, but on a more eugenic fashion.Kenneth Grant and the Cthulhu MythosHalf a century after the Esoteric Order of Dagon was envisioned byLovecraft in Shadow over Innsmouth, the Order materialised on themundane plane as a working magical lodge composed of a small handful ofinitiates. The current incarnation of the Esoteric Order of Dagon beganwith the Announcement in 1982 of the imminent reification of the ‘Aeon ofCthulhu Rising’. Formulated by a then unknown Oregon student of theCthulhu Mythos, this formal Announcement was published in various occultjournals worldwide initiating a chain of connections of devotees of the‘Lovecraftian Gnosis’.A key figure of the Cthulhu mythos during this time of change was theoccultist Kenneth Grant, Outer Head of the Order of the ‘TyphonianO.T.O.’. The Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) is the name applied to anarcane tradition that, in the 18th century, appeared under the leadership ofAdam Weishaupt (1748-1830) then known as the Order of the Illuminati."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"38 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1In the late 19th century Karl Kellner an Austrian magical Adept gave to ita new impetus and the name by which it is now known, the Ordo TempliOrientis. In 1923 the English magician, Aleister Crowley, took the Order’sleadership, becoming the third Grand Master. After his death in 1947 theaffairs of the O.T.O. were conducted by its Treasurer, Karl Germer. In1955, Kenneth Grant assumed leadership of the Order, dissolved itsMasonic structure, although not the Order’s Masonic affiliations, andrealigned it with the Stellar Wisdom Tradition and it was therein known asthe Typhonian O.T.O. He also initiated within the Order an independentcell, known as the New Isis Lodge, for the purpose of channelling extra-terrestrial transmissions. The Lodge operated between 1955 and 1962,during which period the Stellar Wisdom was fully aligned with the magicalCurrent of Thelema (93) with which the Order had first been inspired underCrowley’s leadership.In a series of books known as the Typhonian Trilogies dating back to the1970’s, Kenneth Grant initially presented a series of affinities between thewritings of H.P. Lovecraft with aspects of Crowley’s Cult.21 Later on,Grant’s writing provides qabalistic associations between deities of theCthulhu mythos and the Tree of Life, although warning thesecorrespondences are not absolute, and gives strange recollections of occultworkings based upon the deities made manifest by Lovecraft, known asthe Cthulhu mythos, with which the New Isis Lodge operated.In the Typhonian Trilogies Dagon is associated with Neptune and theworship of which ‘was a survival into historic times of the vastly ancientcult of the Deep Ones.’ Furthermore it is suggested that the symbol of theDragon of the Deep may have been introduced into ancient mythology by‘actual encounters on earth between amphibious extraterrestrials andprimitive humanity’.22 Grant employs a qabalistic method known as gematriain his occult studies and many references to this are found in his work.Gematria is based on the relative numerical value of words with each letterhaving a numerical value. Words of identical numerical value are consideredto be thus associated and explanatory of each other. Grant describes Dagonas the Chief Atlantean deity and uses gemantric methods to equate Dagon"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 39qabalistically to the number 777. In this, Grant is using an alternative spellingof Dagon, } u g d, as opposed to the more conventional form of } w g d.Replacing n with the more guttural u presents a perfectly viable alternativeand subsequently results in Dagon as 777 corresponding toj j j j j w f y l q÷h m l f y l q÷h m l f y l q÷h m l f y l q÷h m l f y l q÷h m l w u u u u u, ‘the World of the Qliphoth’, a qabalistic termdescribing the regions of the Tree of Life that are inhabited by soullessentities known as the Adverse Tree.23 Grant makes a further connectionwith Dagon as 777;Aiwas, as 418 (AiFass), is the active form of Spirit. 359(Shaitan) is half 718 (the number of the Stele of Revealing,and of Aossic-Aiwass). Shaitan-aiwass is therefore theformula of Pan, or All (i.e. AL), the Baphometic Goat ofthe Templars and the Cock of the Yezidi, as well as Shaitan-Aiwass and also the total number of the Paths and Power-Zones of the Tree of Life.23The Revival of the Cult of DagonBy the mid-1980s, invitations to join the Esoteric Order of Dagon hadbeen issued by the pseudonymous ‘Randolph Carter’,24to such individuals already privately working the Mythos,and the structure of the Order had begun to cohere into anetwork of semi-autonomous Lodges. Each of these Lodgesoperated under the control of its respective Lodgemasteror Lodgemistress (designated XIII*), all in turn under thecentral Directorship of Frater Zkauba XXIII*.26In 1987 the office of Director passed to Soror Azenath XXIII* whenZkauba entered into his ‘Greater Magickal Retirement’27 and a new phasein the evolution of the Order began. Soror Azenath made contact with ayoung Englishman deeply influenced by the Typhonian Trilogies of MrGrant and engrossed in the iconography of the Cthulhu Mythos. It was tothis man that the Directorship passed. Subsequently, the Grand R’lyeh"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"40 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1Lodge found a new home in the United Kingdom under the guidance ofFrater Nephren-Ka XXIII*.After five years, Frater Nephren-Ka entered into his Retirement.Having been unable to make the transmission of the XXIII* to a newDirector, he took the decision to place the Order into a Period ofSilence, of indefinite duration.26In 1997 an ex-Initiate of the Order of Dagon, known as Frater Bokrug,successfully petitioned the Yaddith Lodge for permission to open a newLodge of the Order, thus ending the Period of Silence. In due course,Bokrug assumed the office of Director left vacant by Nephren-Ka, takingthe name of Frater Eibon XXIII* and re-establishing the full Degree Systemand Lodge Structure of the Order on the Outer. Following the resignationof Frater Eibon, the Directorship was transferred, by the three members ofthe ruling Yaddith Lodge, to Frater Tutulu XXIII*. As a result, for a numberof years now the E.O.D. has been affiliated with the Typhonian O.T.O.with some members active in both Orders although each has retained itsown identity and programme of magical work.28Members of the EOD regard the imagination as a mental realm not restrictedto the individual but essentially forming a boundless collective unconsciousvaguely analogous to the Amenta of the Ancient Egyptians,29 the ElysianFields of the Greeks30 and the Mauve Zone of Kenneth Grant,31It is the work of our initiates to explore this realm of thecosmic Imagination, to forge their own connections withthe forces and entities which lie beyond human awareness,and hence to incarnate strange children in the matrix ofimagination. How they do this is conditioned by their inherentmeans of expression - writing, painting, carving, drawing,etc. The Esoteric Order of Dagon is a magical order, butrecognises that magic covers a much wider field than mightbe immediately apparent. All creation is magical, in that it isthe reification of an impulse, a primal dream.36"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 41This has opened a new chapter in the history of the Esoteric Order ofDagon, ‘with a concerted commitment to the re-earthing of the current ofmagical creativity which had originally inspired Randolph Carter, twodecades ago’.26ConclusionThe early history of the worship of Dagon remains shrouded in mystery.The etymology adopted by Philo Byblius is possibly due to amisapprehension of the name. The true origin of Dagon is open to questionand a great weakness of the human mind is to ‘reconstruct the wholedinosaur from a single bone’. However the majority of evidence points toa fish deity of the Deep. Yet along the Mediterranean shore a twofoldconception and representation of Dagon was probably developed in thecourse of time.In twentieth century Western occultism, Dagon along with othermanifestations of ancient deities, clearly re-emerged as a direct result ofthe writings of H.P. Lovecraft and such leading occultists as Kenneth Grant.The subsequent manifestation of the Esoteric Order of Dagon is a testamentto the survival and the powerful presence that an ancient Mesopotamiangod has in contemporary society. The cult of Dagon has undergone whatcan only be described as punctuated evolution but the existence of thecurrent manifestation means that Dagon will be extant for some time tocome."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"42 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1Notes1.
