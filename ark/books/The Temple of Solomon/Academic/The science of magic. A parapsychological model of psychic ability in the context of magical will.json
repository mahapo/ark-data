There has been much written about the art ofmagic, but very little of the abstract science of that art has taken ontruly empirical edicts. The following paper describes a parapsychologicalmodel of psychic ability in terms of its intrinsically magical undercurrent,thereby providing a bridge between science and magic that has seldombeen remarked upon, save for occasional discussion (e.g. Roney-Dougal1991). The model, termed ‘psi-mediated instrumental response’ (PMIR),seeks to explain the unconscious everyday use of ‘psi’ (precognition,telepathy, clairvoyance, or psychokinesis) as a means of serving theneeds and desires of the organism. While the model is based on theprinciples and research of cognitive, behavioural, and para- psychology,it is intended that by extending the inferences of this model and bysubtly re-orientating it to a magical perspective it can serve as a useful"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 91psychology of magical operation, or an aspect of it at least, in a trulyscientific sense.Solve...Coming from a purely psycho-biological perspective Rex Stanford initiallyput forward his PMIR model of psychic functioning in 1974, and thengently tweaked it and supported it over a period of successivepublications spanning sixteen years, but fundamentally altered it little(Stanford 1974a, 1974b, 1977, 1982, 1990). Synchronously, with thepublication of SSOTBME by Ramsey Dukes 1974 also heralded theformation of the bare principles of chaos magic (Dukes 2000;Illuminates of Thanteros 2002), to which Stanford’s propositions havean uncanny resemblance, as will be demonstrated, although, PMIRcorresponds most closely with the works of Austin Osman Spare, whichpreceded them both. Nevertheless, from the lack of correspondingliterature it is apparent that Stanford was not even covertly familiarwith such work (a matter confirmed by personal communication –Stanford 2005), nor occultists with his, despite the similarities. His model,while even now remaining somewhat obscure, straddled the theoreticalany-man’s land of the period by relying largely on the then newlyflourishing foundations of cognitive science while simultaneouslyrepresenting vestiges of the aged and declining school of behaviourism.The behaviourist aspect is apparent from the model’s name, which offersthe concept of there being an ‘instrumental response’ to a given stimulus,albeit in this case the stimulus, desire, is internal. Furthermore, thecorresponding behavioural response to the stimulus need not be physicaleither but, according to Stanford’s model, can be psychic too, as inpsychokinesis – the ability to affect matter directly with the mind."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"92 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4The model also assumes a particularly evolutionary flavour byconsidering psychic ability as an adaptive function, which is madeavailable to serve the needs of the individual. Taking this needs-servingfunction of psi as a basic assumption allows the model to offer a usefulaccount of why psi works, and this acts as a forerunner to explaininghow it works. By making the theoretical assumption that psi is need-serving Stanford was able to break down the concept of need into sometestable psychological mechanics. For example, according to PMIR, theprimary motivating factor for psi to occur depends on both ‘need strength’and ‘need relevance’. Such that the greater need there is for psi to servethe organism then the more likely it is to occur. So, for instance, thoughsomewhat banally, your need to stay alive is probably strong enough towarrant your using psi to find a restaurant when you get hungry, but therelevance of the food incentive may prevent you from detecting a greasyfast-food outlet when a tastier option also lies within equal reach.For Stanford (1974a), the needs-driven supposition also incorporateddesires under the rubric of needs, although he later altered theterminology of this proposition to additionally include mere‘dispositions’ (Stanford 1977), thereby covering a far looser range ofmotivating factors, semantically at least. Yet, for all its inclusivity ofexpression, by 1977 Stanford had constricted his earlier generosity andredefined his ‘dispositions’ so that they only actually amounted tobiological tissue needs, learned needs, and conditioned responses,thereby distilling human desires down to a rather reactive robotic brewof behavioural drives. However, this quite Skinnerian view rather chokesthe spirit out of being, and it need not be fundamental to the PMIRmodel. If we instead focus on Stanford’s original central concept of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 93desire, rather than the purely behaviourist images of need that camelater, the model can be seen as a useful psychological framework for themagical function of the will. By considering PMIR’s needs and desiresin equivalence to the will of the magician, Stanford’s followingpsychological portrait of the psychic organism takes on a wholly thelemichue. Thelemic, that is, primarily in the sense that it relates to magicalwill, and less in the sense of the Crowley-ian magical current, becausehere I have chosen to parallel the model mostly to the magical doctrinesof Austin Osman Spare.“What is desired of the Self is given – eventually. The desireis sufficient.” (Spare 1921, p 3)In essence, what Stanford’s model suggests is that desire is the solerequisite for ensuring that the organism tacitly and psychically attractsits desire towards itself, and itself towards its desire. Be it through thepsychic reception of information relevant to the desire, or through thepsychic exertion of one’s will upon the environment. By this means wesee that ‘need strength’ and ‘need relevance’ are psychological correlatesof psychic attraction. Somewhat like magnetic metrics for magicalmanifestation of the will, if you will. The greater the desire, and themore relevant the object or event is to that desire, then the more likelyit is that there will be a psychic response to ensure the two unite. In anevolutionary sense this is born out of the needs basic to the survival ofthe organism, such as sensing immanent danger, or preventing animpending accident from occurring. On a fundamental level though,this equates to the satisfaction of the needs and desires of the individual,and here we see that this ‘goal-orientated’ concept of psi is literally"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"94 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4‘thelemic’ in nature because it defines a psychic reality contingent uponthe will alone.“...That which is indeliberate is the more vital and is will.”(Spare 1921, p 7)The twin functions of the magician’s perception and will, which Carroll(1987) used to define Spare’s Kia, could here equate to psi. Yet, the realharmony in equating PMIR to magical divination and manifestationcomes through the model’s following assumptions. The first of whichstipulates that no conscious awareness of the psychic act, or awarenesseven of the desire, is required for the PMIR to occur. Stanford alsoproposed that psi works through the most economical means available,because it serves a purpose by attending to the needs of the individual.That is, the psychic agent may well be an unwitting wizard, butfurthermore, the PMIR actually works better where the individual isunwise to its action. To this end, Stanford offered that humans tend toreact more successfully to their unconscious primary drives rather thantheir conscious cognitions, an idea which is supported by the notionestablished in cognitive psychology of ‘implicit knowledge’ commonlydriving behaviour. For Stanford, the individual reacts to psi informationin the same way as they would react to subliminal or other ‘implicit’information. So conscious awareness of psi-accessed information, forexample, is redundant if the function of that information can be betterutilised unconsciously, and therefore directly, through a ‘psi-mediatedinstrumental response’. Or quite simply put, you don’t have to knowpsi is working for it to work, and it actually works better if you don’t,because there’s less interference that way. The same might be said ofmagic."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 95Receptive magic – perceiving the web outside of timeand space Focusing here on the case of ‘receptive psi’ serving the organism(telepathy, clairvoyance, or precognition, terms that have, perhapsmisleadingly, been called extra sensory perception, ESP), psi is proposedto function better unconsciously because the conscious cognition ofthe psi information may easily get confabulated and distorted by ongoingcognitions, and this is obviously counterproductive. Expressing this indata language, the information is more likely to become degraded bydata noise if it becomes conscious and, according to Stanford, it wouldmost often be better responded to instead by unconscious alterations tobehaviour, memory, thinking, emotions, or even desires. This sitscomfortably with the techniques used by the practitioners of thedivinatory arts, who may endeavour to clear their mind of consciousthoughts before they scry, or at least settle them, yet most will also usetools flexible enough to channel through the subtleties of the signalbefore they even attempt to cognise it. Elsewhere, in parapsychologicalresearch, free association of one’s stream of consciousness in an alteredstate seems to be the favoured method of eliciting divine information(as in the Ganzfeld method), although this also gives a lot of superfluousverbal flotsam. Yet, bypassing the conscious mind completely by tappingdirectly into the unconscious psi information has been superblydemonstrated by research recently demonstrating the apparent psychicanticipation of arousing images. This psychic anticipation was indicatedsolely by psychophysiological markers, such as galvanic skinconductance, a general measure of physiological arousal (e.g. Beirman2000; Radin 1997). This research has shown a small but quite distinct"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"96 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4bodily presentiment to arousing stimuli several seconds before theirdelivery, strongly supporting Stanford’s unconscious psi hypothesis.Going a little beyond Stanford’s vision, others have noted that theconscious awareness of psi information has the added hazard of havingto contend with that most ingrained rationalist abhorrence common tomodern wo/man, the fear of psi (e.g. Braude 1993; Tart 1984). Givenall the terrifying psychotic implications of psychic transparency thatare loaded within the idea of our being latently omniscient, and thenmixed with the quite blasphemous possibility that we may also be latentlyomnipotent too, the fear of psi would seem a well buried yet determinedphobia of our own psychic abilities, no doubt common to many, evenmagicians. Given this fear of psi, any conscious psi cognitions, assumingthey can be recognised as such, would cause a ‘cognitive dissonance’between subconscious belief and experience in all but the most mentallyliberated individuals, rendering the information useless. The logic inthis cognitive dissonance concept combined with Stanford’s cognitivedistortion of conscious psychic information seem jointly more thancapable in accounting for why only the most extreme incidences of psi-information make themselves known spontaneously to the individual,such as in crisis apparitions (e.g. visions of absent relatives as they die).“Magic, like Science is reluctant to shatter our basic beliefs.”(Dukes, 2000 p 24)However, in the usual case, Stanford proposed that everyday psi-information attempts to satisfy its desire-driven goal by expressing itselfthrough unconscious behaviour, thought, desires, memories, emotions,and even psychokinesis, in such a way as to be maximally economical."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 97To do so, the PMIR manifests itself through ‘ready responses’, i.e.processes which are very likely to happen, so that no major deviationsin conscious action are necessary, merely the subtle alteration of a normalimpending action. This occurs through various mechanisms such asunconscious timing changes, so, for example, that you may unconsciouslyspeed yourself up to ‘serendipitously’ bump into someone you hopedto see. Alternatively, the response may be expressed through one’smemory, by forgetting to do something, or remembering something else,or it may happen through an unconsciously psi-mediated mistake.Additionally, the PMIR may exert itself through association, either madeemotionally or through a train of thought. Psi-information may even bebest expressed through unconscious psychokinesis. But only in theextreme case, as explained already, does psi-information naturallymanifest itself to the conscious mind. Through these means ‘magic’occurs very much more frequently than is ever actually noticed by thecasual observer, and this resembles Dukes’ (2000, p 78) point that, “wemight not see magic only because we are taught not to believe in it”.Here perhaps, knowledge of PMIR would help the aspiring mage tospot when such subtle magic is happening.“Instead of defying causality, modern Magic tends to stretch itslowly, within the operator’s subjectively conceived world”(Dukes 2000, p 23)For Stanford, what mattered most was that the PMIR occurseconomically, and for that, it is best expressed unconsciously and inaccordance with the individual’s current action. This concept may havemore accord with the tacit practicalities of reality than with establishedoccult doctrine concerning the economics of magic, but it has pragmatic"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"98 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4appeal for the demands of both the will, and the imagination, if magicexpresses itself often through mundane and invisible means, save forthe end results. This is akin to the Robert Anton Wilson adage that‘reality is what you can get away with’, and lets face it, it should be adamn sight easier to get away with profound, but little, tweaks in thenormal construction of reality than straining to summon an enormousvisible Cthulhu-type entity to eat your foe in the living room. Not thatI’m being pessimistic about the bounds of possibility I just recognisethat magical manifestation in general, and any ordinary unwitting magicparticularly, is seemingly limited by a Reality Violation Principle. This,I propose, is nothing more than the sense that whatever one wills ordesires to happen can only occur within the limitations of one’s willand imagination. Given that these are suitably focused and capable ofcompletely convincing the mind of the magician, gaining their absolutebelief, and possibly those of others involved, then theoretically anythingis possible. But it’s a far tougher job cutting across the grain of perceivedconsensus reality than it is working with it. This idea is self-evident inthe peculiar and often unexpected way that desire tends to manifestitself magically. As noted by Dukes (2000, p 23) “Nowadays theMagician...is unlikely to find his spells will defy causality – e.g. insteadof materialising gold coins, he might have ‘luck’ on a state lottery”. It isprobably easier to change consensus reality enough for the magic tooccur than it is to transgress its integrity, and this is the basis of creatingtemporary yet complete magical belief during group ritual.Expressive magic – the manifestation of desire“The desire determines, and no later belief will alter it onewhit.” (Spare 1921, p 6)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 99Applying his model to so called ‘active psi’, Stanford (1974b) looked toresearch of spontaneous cases of psychokinesis (PK) primarily, andfound these reflected the same unwitting expression of desire specifiedby his model for receptive psi. In one-off cases, such as the stopping ofa clock at the time of someone’s death, the PK appears to beunconsciously concocted, yet always expressive of something relevantor important to the person involved. In cases of recurrent spontaneouspsychokinesis (known as RSPK), such as so called poltergeist activity,there is always a central person around which the activity occurs, andalso ceases in their absence. In such instances, the poltergeist activity isseen as the expression of suppressed hostility towards others, which,because it rarely hurts anyone physically, is a safe form of harassment.This is because the agent has no conscious control, and therefore noownership or responsibility for the events. A prime example of such acase involved torrents of water gushing inexplicably from the ceiling,whilst all the vessels in the house containing liquids spilled themselveson the floor (Auerbach 1996). These events occurred to a family whoseson was forced by his father to stay in the swimming team against hiswill, thereby demonstrating RSPK as a poetic manifestation of anger.Despite the scarcity of spontaneous PK cases, laboratory PK has proveneven more rare and difficult to manifest on a visible (macro) scale,although there is very good laboratory evidence to suggest the influenceof PK on randomly controlled micro systems, such as the outcome ofdice rolls or other random event generators (e.g. Radin & Nelson 1989).In such research, the results seem to suggest that the greatest effects,usually measured statistically, occur in the moment when the agent stopstrying to cause the PK to happen, and this is called the ‘release of effort’effect."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"100 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4“Conscious desire is the negation of possession: theprocrastination of reality. Make thy desire subconscious; theorganic is creative impulse to will.” (Spare 1921, p 3)That visible psychokinesis occurs so rarely and is never owned by theindividual is, for Stanford, a fundamental feature of the necessity forunconscious active psi. The fact that efforts to manifest PK in thelaboratory are much less dramatic than those occurring spontaneouslyreflects the hindrance of consciously aware and owned attempts at PK.This quirk has been aptly demonstrated by the likes of Batcheldor (1966),who was able to demonstrate remarkable table tipping phenomenaduring experimental pseudo-séances. Batcheldor accounted for thesepronounced PK effects with the explanation that ownership inhibitedPK, but could be bypassed by abdicating responsibility to the group.Furthermore, by invoking the mercurial trickster and utilising a‘deliberate deception technique’ to get things started, Batcheldor wasable to overcome what he called ‘witness inhibition’ to PK by deceivinghis group into thinking that the table tipping was caused by unseen,normal forces, which it was - initially at least. Once witness inhibitionhad been overcome, amid much humour, by the spectacle of observingoneself performing pseudo-PK in a group, the deliberate deception wasunknowingly (i.e. deceptively) ceased and real PK began; unwittingly.Thereby demonstrating that you may need to ‘fake it till you make it’ tosurmount the barriers of belief.That such barriers of belief exist makes unconscious, un-owned,unknowing, and released desire near essential to the spontaneousmanifestation of will as psi, or perhaps even magic? This has beenexpressed nowhere more succinctly than by Spare (1913/1975, p 2)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 101when he wrote that “Unless desire is subconscious, it is not fulfilled, nonot in this life. Then verily sleep is better than prayer.” Indeed, to supportthis notion of unconscious nonattachment Stanford cited research byMcConnell (1955) that demonstrated a successful attempt to affect dicerolls during sleep. Furthermore, despite his clearly non-occult academic-psychology stance, Stanford (1974b) also drew upon parallels fromprayer, spiritual healing, and religious or magical rites to further informhis model. Stripping down these rituals into constituent parts Stanfordbegins to seem like an early chaos magician searching for the bareprinciple components of spell casting when he identified that, for thedesire to manifest, an appeal must be made to a supernatural agencythrough the use of ritual. However, more importantly he informed usthat the ritual is necessary but not sufficient to produce the effect, butthrough this action the responsibility becomes mediated to a supernaturalagency. For the magician, this supernatural agency can be the angel,demon, god, spirit, element, or even just ‘sympathy’ that is evoked orinvoked.Dukes (2000, p 53) has noted that magicians have long since identifieddemons and angels as being part of their own mind but regrets “theimplicit Scientific deduction that being part of our own minds meansthat they ‘don’t exist’”. Yet for Stanford, whether the supernatural agencyexists or not was largely irrelevant, perhaps because it went beyond therealms of his field. What was important is that the agency serves todisplace any inhibitory ownership, a matter which is convenient inpreventing the magical or religious belief system from collapsing shouldthe ritual fail. Yet astute as this observation is, here Stanford failed toalso recognise that the displacement of ownership insures against the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"102 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4surfacing of those submerged fears of omnipotence that provoke theinhibitive fear of success, and furthermore, should the ritual actuallybe successful, it also prevents against inducing megalomania.“The soul, proud and blighted... is a civil war of desire”(Spare, 1921, p 8)It was further offered by Stanford that intentional psychokinetic researchanecdotes teach us that a seemingly paradoxical sense of hope, yetcomplete abandonment, creates a psi-conducive balance of beliefs.Recent research has shown that the most psi-conducive volitionalstrategy in tests of intentional psychokinesis is best described as an‘effortless effort’ (Houtkooper, 2004). Stanford offered that such acontradictory condition is necessary because otherwise ego-involvementleads to a fear of failure, which only induces desperation and scatteredefforts. This is a point aptly delivered by Spare (1913/1975, p 51) withhis art of sigilisation. “The sigil, being a vehicle, serves the function ofprotecting consciousness from the direct manifestation of the(consciously unacknowledged) obsession, conflict is avoided with anyincompatible ideas and neither gains separate personality”. Here conflictapplies to the contrary urges reflective of the original desire competingagainst its corresponding distortions that may emanate as the fear ofsuccess, the fear of failure, or any other such competing desires.“Complex desire is the further creation of different desire, notthe realization of (particular) desire.” (Spare 1921, p 3)In generalising about the function of ritual in manifesting desire,Stanford offered that the act of manifestation should be ‘ego-alien’,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 103because this prevents the ego misdirecting the will, abnegates personalresponsibility, and provides a sense that the outcome will be meaningfuland comprehensible. Despite offering no further explanation on thislatter point it is presumed that the miraculous outcome is meaningfulbecause it occurs within the context of the magical or religious beliefsystem, although even a parapsychological belief system such as theone implied by this model should do. Here Stanford also pointed outthat the dominant belief system conditions the specific nature of thephenomena produced, and gave the example of the cold war Russianpsychokinetic star, Nina Kulagina, who couched the cause of her rareskill in terms of ‘bioplasma’ (Pratt & Keil 1973).“To will well, to will long, to will always, but never to lustafter anything, such is the secret of power”(Levi 1856/1968, p 245)Before influencing the external object, Kulagina would build up greatphysical stress, and Stanford used this as an example of how intenseritual focus also serves to absorb the attention of the agent so that theego becomes detached from the operation. However, Stanford speculatedthat in most other situations focused attention on PK targets inhibitsits manifestation, which he called ‘attention wishing inhibition’, andhence the release of effort effect. This release of effort is thepsychological equivalent to Spare’s quiescence, the art of letting go ofthe desire and releasing the will. It is also the act of banishing, whichseeks to detach the mind of the magician from the act.“Why is belief always incarnating? Though oft times not evena sincere wish?” (Spare 1921, p 10)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"104 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4Conversely to the ‘attention wishing inhibition’, Stanford also proposedthat even focused attention on desired events that are about to unfoldnaturally can cause a counterproductive PK inhibition or retardation ofthe event. As an anecdotal example you need only think about urging-on a sluggish piece of technology whilst desperately requiring its slickperformance in a moment of need, such as the observed malfunctionof one’s printer while dancing on the edge of a deadline. Essentially,direct attention on one’s desire, although initially necessary, is inhibitiveof its manifestation, so truly a watched pot never boils.“The will, the desire, the belief, lived as inseparable, becomerealization.” (Spare 1921 p 3)In essence of PMIR, for the desire to manifest itself outside of thebody, the desire, or need, should be suitably strong and the will shouldbe appropriately focused. To best achieve this, Stanford suggested thatother avenues of action must seem unavailable and a supernatural agencymust be invoked and appealed to properly, thereby abnegatingresponsibility to the agency and reducing concern, and focusing theattention prior to releasing it. In magical terms, “The sorcerer should beable to deliberately forget, or at least become consciously detached from,the outcome of the rite” (Humphries & Vayne 2004, p 13).“What is there to believe that is free of belief? What is thereto wish that is safe from reaction?” (Spare 1921, p 10)Whatever the formula, conscious manifestation requires a belief systemupon which to hang it and the manipulation of the delicate intricaciesinherent within its technique, so the PMIR model indicates that"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 105unconscious focus itself works best, freeing the agent from some of theparadoxical pitfalls that arise when desire encounters belief. For example,as Lee (2003 p 108) notes, the path of belief, intrinsic in attempts ofconscious manifestation, can be a sceptical cul-de-sac, because “the wholegame of questioning reality, if taken as a game of doubting, puts theissue of belief in the foreground.” Indeed, Spare (1913/1975) rathersuggested that belief is merely counterproductive and that even to haveneed of belief diminishes the purpose.“Every man is a God, in whatsoever he will his belief.”(Spare 1921, pp 13-14)Regardless of belief factors, Stanford has offered a set of principles forthe realisation of the magical will, dressed as it is in the cloak of psychicexpression, and spoken in the language of academic psychology ratherthan an occult dialect. In its inception PMIR is a means of explainingpsi and delineating its contours, and in doing so it paints an image ofpsi as an everyday ability that most often secretly serves the unattended-to desires of the individual, and in quite subtle and sublime ways. AsDukes (2000 p 84) notes “...the modern Magician can hope for runs ofluck or some ‘amazing coincidences’, but he should not expect too manygold coins to materialise from thin air.” It is rather a hidden angel thana rowdy demon doing one’s bidding. Yet it is clear that there are also anumber of limiting factors to the true expression of the will, preventingthis conceptual guardian angel from always creating a perfectenvironment for the unknowingly blessed. Yet, in PMIR most of theselimitations are actually eliminated when the will acts without theobserver, making the somnambulist potentially omnipotent and"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"106 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4omniscient, so Stanford has been judicious in noting other factors thatobstruct the free expression of unconscious psi.Given that PMIR most often functions through the ready responses ofthe individual, particularly with receptive psi, then these responses mustbe suitably flexible to allow for the subtle, implicit redirection of theagent towards its goal. The principle is, again, simply one of expressiveeconomy. If the behavioural repertoire of the individual is overlyrestricted or determined, then the expression of unconscious goal-directed mistakes, mistimings, associations, and memory omissions ortriggers become much less fluid or available. Examples of this restrictivebehaviour include the use of rigid schedules and plans; rational,determined, and un-impulsive actions; and repetitive responses, whichStanford respectively termed behavioural- rigidity, inhibition, andstereotyping. Response chaining, the tendency to follow familiar eventswith habitual actions, was also noted as being restrictive, as were strongpreoccupations, which suppress the expression of the sublime will. Takentogether these factors form the model’s supposition numbered byStanford (1974a) as the eighth PMIR component, which, appropriately,relates it to the mercurial nature of Hod in kabalistic terms.“Chaos magic is results magic, designed to get you what youneed” (Ellwood, 2004)Collectively these psi-inhibitive behaviours and compulsions areantithetical to what Braud (1980) termed psi-conducive ‘lability’, whichmay be seen as the desired personality substrate of chaos that lurkswithin the magical current of that name. To the discordian, this translatesinto the Church of the Subgenius’ power of slack, or more eruditely,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 107this relates to what Weibel (2003) refers to as the disorder intentionallycreated within situations to make them compatible with the use of magic.It is those ambiguous states of in-between, the undecided conjunctionat the crossroads where, in the language of physics, consciousness hasnot yet collapsed the state vector. And it relates to what Vayne (2001)reminds us is the ‘liminal’ state. It also vindicates the Spare-ian reasoningbehind transmuting the identity into a metamorphic ensemble ofeffluvious ‘selfs’. How better to conduct the chaotic current of Kia?No doubt unwittingly, Stanford (1978) further offered himself as a chaos-magic theorist when he suggested that the body-brain system functionsas a random event generator necessary for the reception of psi. He alsolater supposed that chaotic EEG traces would be psi-conducive, therebyimplicating chaos as the primary medium through which magic manifestsand announced ‘readiness for change’ as a central tenet of PMIR (Stanford1990).“One thing is desired, another is thought; and a differentbecomes. Everything loved obtains an obscene disease.”(Spare 1921, p 8)While the PMIR model outlined so far is encompassing enough toaccommodate the conditions both favourable and anathema to psi, themodel also comes equipped with a breakdown feature to account forinstances where psi manifests desire counter to the needs of theindividual using it. Here Stanford (1990) proposed that when individualsare disposed towards negative self-esteem (or self-concept, or self-imagerespectively in Stanford, 1974a, 1982), neuroticism, or conflicting needsor desires, then psi may manifest itself in ways counterproductive tothe needs of the organism."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"108 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4“What man can prevent his belief from incarnating? Who isfree of filth and disease? All men are servile to the greatunconsciousness of their purpose in desire” (Spare 1921, p 11)In some instances this counterproductive expression of psi is somethinglike psychic masochism and can occur in combination with guilt andthe unconscious desire to be punished. Indeed, as Spare (1921, p 9)intoned “What man prohibits and then commits will certainly causesuffering, because he has willed double. Born of complex desire, resultsof actions are dual, multitudinous virtue and vice.” Such conflictingdesires, as when they are prohibited, were clearly unhealthy for WilliamBlake (1994, p 181) when he wrote “He who desires but acts not, breedspestilence”. Similarly, although he speculated upon the precise wording,Stanford was certain of the centrality of negative aspects of ‘self’ inmanifesting maladaptive consequences through psi, just as they wouldthrough non-psi behaviour. Extending this notion to desire’s oppositepole would then include the metaphor that “Fear attracts bullets” (Levi1856, p 34), which may be taken quite literally. For as Spare (1921, p 2)asks, “Is fear of desire?”...et Coagula“Will to pleasure is the basic function underlying all activitywhether conscious or not, -and whatsoever the means.”(Spare 1921, p 7)Evaluating the PMIR model, Stanford (1990) was able to report areasonable body of evidence to support most of his suppositions,although he urged for further research to shore-up these claims. Centralto his ideas is the notion that psi is driven by the needs, desires, or"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 109dispositions of the individual, and in achieving these aims psi is solelygoal-orientated. That is, only the desire and the goal – the object ofdesire – are in themselves sufficient to cause psi. In terms of receptivepsi this means that the need-serving psi-information is automaticallysought out and that there is no need to scan the entirety of theinformation available, and this makes it far simpler than the alternativebecause, empirically, psi appears to have no outer limits in space ortime so the available information is essentially infinite. As such, any‘informational’ system of psi would seemingly have problems processingthat much data without any known boundaries, so a goal-orientatedmodel is also advantageous. So rather than an informational, orcybernetic model of psi, PMIR is fundamentally teleological, because itis concerned with the direct consequence of purpose. Yet, Stanfordalso recognised that, once the psi information had actually been received,it was then processed cybernetically, so that it then became subject toall the usual processing trends known to cognitive psychology.Nevertheless, the fundamental process for the occurrence of psi wascontingent solely upon teleological factors. In terms of magic, this makesPMIR primarily thelemic, in the true sense of the word as being ‘of thewill’, rather than techgnostic, in the way that Davis (1999) visualisesinformation, or McKenna (1991) visualises language, rather than will,as the official substrate of magical reality.Yet despite the intuitive appeal of a teleological model Stanford hadbecome slightly suspicious of it by 1990 and, thinking that the definitionof ‘goal’ was a bit vague, he hoped to distance himself from its ‘magical’connotations.

This argumentitself becomes quite complex when considering expressive psi (i.e.psychokinesis), but there is a good theoretical argument that alllaboratory psychokinesis so far, which is largely demonstrated on a microrather than a macro level, can be explained conceptually in terms ofprecognition (e.g. see May, Spottiswoode, & Utts 1995). Precognition,unlike psychokinesis, can easily be conceptualised cybernetically.“According to Magical theory, the outcome of an act will beinfluenced by the intent of the actor, so any Scientificexperiment or measurement carried out with a desire to provesomething will be affected by that desire...”(Dukes 2000, p 39)To make the whole theoretical complication a bit saltier, Stanford’sPMIR, like any concept of unconscious psi, implicates the actualexperimenter as a cause of the results of psi experiments just as muchas the participants, if not more so. As Stanford (1990) noted, in criticismof others’ work, it is often the experimenter who has the strongest desireto get positive results. This has rather distasteful implications for anyscientist because it means that the desires of the experimenter may beresponsible for any results that occur. Mainstream psychology has longbeen aware of the potential, non-psi, ‘experimenter effect’ and has oftenresponded to its threat with seemingly adequate blind controls. But itspsychic equivalent, experimenter psi, rather upsets any hope of obtainingobjective scientific results because blind controls become quite"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 111meaningless. This is probably the main reason why parapsychology haslong been so unpopular amongst its bigger scientific peers - psychologyin particular. The philosopher of science Karl Popper was also unpopularfor suggesting that objectivity was a subjective illusion. Returning tothe issue of Shannon entropy, because of experimenter psi it may wellbe that this apparent cybernetic behaviour of psi is, quite literally, justwishful thinking on the behalf of the experimenter.“...Scientists, understandably, would question this assertion”.(Dukes 2000, p 39)Devoting an entire paper to the topic of experimenter psi, entitled ‘Arewe shamans or are we scientists?’, Stanford (1981) had already becomequite concerned not just with the tacit science of magic, but with thegrowing implication of science as magic. Like most parapsychologistsStanford (1990) has, however, been quite dismissive of experimenterpsi. Reviewing the evidence, he invoked the god of Occam’s razor andsuggested that it was more plausible that experimental psi was due tothe participant rather than the experimenter, because of the complexityof psi involved otherwise. While the law of parsimony elsewhere hasits elegance, Stanford’s (1990 p 98) attempts here to “...put down themyth of almost omnipotent experimenter psi” are reminiscent of DoctorFrankenstein trying to kill his own monstrous creation. It also seems tobackfire because issues of psi complexity and parsimony becomeobsolete when it is remembered that, in PMIR, psi is goal-orientated –the desire manifests directly without heed of the process."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"112 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4“In the Science sector an open, skeptical mind is a virtue thatone aspires to, in the Magic sector it is an inner emptiness oneseeks to fill with meaning”. (Dukes 2000, p 46)In the end, Stanford (1990, p 113) finally back-peddled over hisreservations about goal-orienated psi but still remained somewhatequivocal of his concept, accepting it for the time being – “It is probablytoo soon to dismiss entirely the earlier formulation of PMIR that assumesthe goal-oriented character of psi...but I confess to uneasiness aboutthe magical quality of such a formulation...”. It is here ironic to hear ascientist, in attempting to deny his own model, eventually discuss itless logically and rather more in terms of his ‘feeling’, a mode ofoperation which Dukes (2000) has pointed out is definitively magical,not scientific (see also Snell, 2004).“In fact a scientific investigation which came to anyconclusion in favour of Magic would be as disturbing to me asto other Scientists”. (Dukes 2000, p 56)It is perhaps not surprising that as a scientist Stanford had some difficultyaccepting his own model, despite its empirical cohesion, given theintrinsically magical nature of it, as has been shown throughout thisessay. Magicians too can be reluctant to accept scientific explanationsof magic. Nevertheless, PMIR is based upon the findings of a greatwealth of psychological and parapsychological research and has itselfbeen tested empirically to some extent, largely fulfilling all its hypotheses– experimenter psi aside. It is by dint of being empirically testable inthis way that makes Stanford’s model a genuinely scientific model ofpsi, and, by extension, of magical reception and expression too. Being"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 113empirically testable in this way is what distinguishes a scientific modelfrom a pseudo-scientific theory, which I suspect, is partly what PhilHine objects to.“...magick has become obfuscated under a weight of words, awelter of technical terms which exclude the uninitiated andserve those who are eager for a ‘scientific’ jargon with whichto legitimise their enterprise into something self-important andpompous.” (Hine 1995, p 11)Yet, for all its obfuscation to the scientifically uninitiated, PMIR, as amodel rather than a theory, does not attempt to explain what psi is, merelywhy psi works, and, more importantly, how it works psychologically. Thewhy – that it is evolutionarily needs-serving – might be wrong, butregardless of this the how can only be useful, because, for the magician’spurposes, it need not be right if it works. As Dukes (2000, p 34) haspointed out, for the magician “...the theory is being accepted onlybecause it is ‘working’, not because it is ‘true’...”Nevertheless, it would help to further our understanding and help inspireconfidence in those who would choose to use this model magically ifscientific ‘evidence’ can support it. Furthermore, Dukes (1992, p 128)has offered that “...occultists...are still asking permission of scienceto belief in magic”. Apparently, magicians are still experiencing ahangover from the enormous influence of science and its obsessionwith causality and, particularly, falsification (Dukes 2000). Ideally,magicians are concerned with association not causality, and should onlybe interested in verifying rather than falsifying their temporary magicalbeliefs. However, such subjective magical conviction about reality is"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"114 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4apparently proving problematic to new-millennium magicians because“Magic...inherits unconscious scepticism from Science. Just as the ‘openminded’ Scientist is deep down a total believer in material reality, soalso the ‘gullible’ Magician deep down does not really believe in anything.”(Dukes 2000, p 45)“What so many un-evolved Magical thinkers are trying to do isconvince themselves of the reality of Magic which, deepdown, they do not believe can really exist” (Dukes 2000, p 46)If Dukes is right, perhaps PMIR can help the struggling un-evolvedmagicians, seeking to shed their sceptical skin, to realise that magic canexist and to help them know where to spot it. Having the conviction ofempirical reason behind it, perhaps a model such as PMIR can offeraspiring mages a solid scientific basis for belief in magic, as anintermediary part of the process of weaning them onto much moreflamboyant modes of thought. As Dukes (2000 p 84) noted “...it isinteresting to wonder whether it is the strength of Scientific beliefswhich gives them their power to unify our experience”. Yet whilst flirtingwith the power of scientific belief, Dukes also warned that, whilstmagical thought is complete, scientific theories all too often becomeoutdated and those ‘chaoist’ mages who are dressed in a lab coats areleft feeling somewhat ridiculous when the science moves on.Nevertheless, new millennium magicians are reminded that ‘nothing istrue, everything is possible’ and that beliefs are there to be borrowedtemporarily as befits the purpose. Whether or not science is built uponshifting sands, those with winged feet may find that “...in order to bean effective and practising magician in contemporary times one must"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 115utilize the most practical and cutting edge technology and theories ofthe era” (P-orridge 2003, pp 113-114).“...the irrational feeling which haunts some of us – the feelingthat Science is shrinking the world and making it more boringand empty – is possibly a betrayal of a suppressed inclinationtowards the magical way of thought” (Dukes 2000, p. 29)Regardless of his fears, Dukes suggested that the dominant scientificway of thinking is nevertheless experiencing a fundamental shift towardsmagical thinking, for reasons too numerous to include in this essay.That this may well be the case has begun to be shown here because,whilst scratching rather covertly at the surface of a science of magic,parapsychology has already unearthed some unpopular signs of scienceas magic, with methodological paradoxes like experimenter psi, forexample. Indeed, Roney-Dougal (1991) supposed that the scientificexperiment is little different from a magical ritual, with the experimenteras the high priest/ess. This concept is now being taken seriously, asMario Varvoglis (2003) in his presidential address to theParapsychological Association suggested that researchers should refineand amplify their experimenter effects, like shamans. So rightly Dukes(2000 p 40), in looking to the future, has predicted that “...it will stillbe called ‘Science’ but it will amount to a choice of belief systems,which is pure Magic”. However, in the meantime, PMIR can serve as auseful scientific model of the psychology of magical manifestation anddivination, offering a usable scientific belief system to those magiciansinclined towards science, and a testable model of magic for thosescientists inclined towards magic. It is possible that both disciplinesmay also learn from the other."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"116 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4“...early anthropologists tended to overlook the positiveaspect of what gets lost in the transition from magic toscience...(and that is) the resonating worldview thatorganically bound the perceptions and procedures of themagician to the holistic web-work of cosmic, animal, andancestral forces.” (Davis 1999, p 173)Finally, although PMIR might be limited in its conception of conditionsfavourable to psi, because, for instance, it omits to consider the role ofaltered states, it is a particularly useful model of the factors necessary forpsi. Similarly, although psi in no way equates entirely to what may beconsidered magic, and is actually only considered by some magicians tobe an unimportant side effect (e.g. Nema 1995), it relates directly tosome of the most basic functions of magic. Psi, in essence, is theanonymous numen of a scientific magic, denied of spirit or personalitybut still recognised by some by its secret names, such as mana(Winkelman 1983) or Kia, it is the expression of the scientific currentof magical thought.ReferencesAuerbach, Loyd M., 1996, Mind over matter, Kensington Books, New York.Batcheldor, Kenneth J., 1966, ‘Report on a case of table levitation andassociated phenomena’, Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, 43, 339-356.Beirman, Dick J., 2000, ‘Anomalous baseline effects in mainstream emotionresearch using psychophysiological variables’, Journal of Parapsychology, 64, 3,239-240.Blake, William, 1994, The works of William Blake, Wordsworth Editions Ltd,Ware, Herts."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 117Braud, William G., 1980, ‘Lability and inertia in psychic functioning’, in B.Shapin & L.
