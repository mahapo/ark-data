I exclude the ‘evocation of spirits’ etc here as outside of currentscientific understanding, though not necessarily beyond future scientificinterpretation. In doing so I shall be opposing the great tide ofphilosophical and scientific bias in favour of Realism - the doctrine ofa physical, mind independent and causally closed, objective reality -and hope to reveal this as a prejudiced dogma through its exposure torival possibilities.The way I shall do this is through an analysis of our present understandingof quantum mechanics, with special reference to magic, and anexploration of those interpretations that might allow magic, or arebelieved to by those with little knowledge of the subject.

It will also ofnecessity touch on the probable relationship between physics and thatother great enigma, consciousness. As such this may strike some asworthy of the classic retort of ‘attempting to explain one mystery interms of another’. However I hope to demonstrate that the possibleinterpretations of quantum mechanics are narrower than many believe,and that its nature might only be regarded as ‘mysterious’ when viewedwithin the framework of the current Realist metaparadigm.1 I concludemagic is indeed possible within a scientific framework and may even bea necessary consequence of the best explanation of quantum cosmology.What follows is a beginning and should be considered as an openinginto a deeper study and possible research project"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"122 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4What is Quantum Mechanics?Quantum mechanics is essentially a mathematical model for predictingthe behavior of subatomic phenomena. It was adopted in the face of aseries of bizarre experimental results that could not be understood withinthe context of any of the existing models of physics, or indeed withinthat of any rational explanative theory - the famous superposition ofparticles and a general defiance of the basic ‘laws of physics’. It wasfound, largely through trial and error, that the form of mathematicsnow utilized in the standard quantum mechanical equations was theonly formulation capable of producing accurate predictions. Theaccuracy of these predictions over the course of nearly a century hassince shown to be 100%, an unheard of degree of accuracy within anyscience. What’s more much of our everyday electronic technology hasbeen based on the consequences of these equations. Quantummechanics, hence forth referred to as QM, has thus been sometimesdubbed the “only true science”.The main philosophical problem with QM is that it appears to make norational sense whatsoever, and arguably its mathematics can not bevisualized. The breakdown of reason inherent is largely due to the factit uses a different mathematical model to that subconsciously deployedin our intuitive judgments of the world, as well due to the relatedredundancy of classical concepts, such as position, motion, time andidentity, within its domain. This has been often interpreted in the contextof a Neo-Kantian notion of the conceptual construction of the worldof everyday experience being distinct from a non-conceptualisableunderlying reality. The problem is accentuated by our relative inabilityto visualize what is being represented by the QM equations. Whereas"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 123the mathematics of Newtonian mechanics could be visualized in termsof billiard balls no such visualization is possible with QM, again due toits apparent departure from ‘common sense’ perceptions of ‘reality’.Two approaches have been taken in dealing with this. One extreme isto argue that the formulation is simply a function that outputs results,that is it is not representing anything, in the way geometry is supposedto, it is in essence a kind of ‘rule of thumb’ for producing results. Anyvisualization we might achieve in such a scenario is thus at best anexplanatory metaphor for understanding the equation rather than adescription of reality (something often also held to be the case forGeneral Relativity Theory and its ‘curvature of space’). The other optionis to argue that the QM formalism is indicative of something ontological,but is enigmatic due to its incompleteness. The amazing degree ofpredictability it produces is said to mitigate against any ‘rule of thumb’,and an ‘exact model’ which ‘does not represent anything’ might bejustifiably regarded as contradictory. I shall be taking the latterperspective in this paper.There are two forms of mathematics used in QM, one is referred to asMatrix Mechanics, the other Wave Mechanics, both have beendemonstrated to be mathematically equivalent and are usedinterchangeably in standard QM. Wave Mechanics is sometimesrepresented as ‘easier to conceptualize’ than Matrix Mechanics, but thelatter is easier to describe in my view and appears to be morefundamental. In very simple terms Matrix Mechanics represents asimulation of the world in which all the possible states of an object orsystem under investigation are represented as vectors (often used torepresent forces in classical physics) within an abstract state space, which"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"124 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4includes a representation of normal space-time (using the FourDimensional Space Operator). This is formulated as a series ofcoordinates for each vector visualisable as a graph-like map, in whichfour axes represent space-time referents and the rest the possible statesof a system. Most of the oddities of the model occur due to the factthat the apparent properties of the object are not representable withinvector space at all, but only within variables representing the operationsthat alter that vector space - the primary operation actually being themeasurement of the property. That is the perceived ‘redness’ of a ‘redobject’, to use a simple archetype, is not the state ‘red’ recorded invector space but is given by the operation that measures that propertyof the object. The operation is represented by a matrix of numbers thatrepresent the operational ‘influences’ on the vectors, and the propertiesof the object have to be coded here in order to match experimentaldata. This seems to imply that the act of measurement, and possiblyother operations on the object, are required for it to actually have anyobservable properties at all! Note this is not saying that these cannot bemeasured without measurement, which would be trivially true. It is sayingthere are no properties without measurement or some similar operation.That is, the operation profoundly changes and defines the state of theobject. No other form of mathematical representation fits theexperiments. Another oddity is that only so called ‘eigenvectors’ withinvector space have fixed values in relation to an operation, such asmeasurement. To understand what this means we can propose a ‘handrule’. Hold your hand out and point forwards with your index fingerwhile your thumb is vertically raised, then rotate your thumb to ahorizontal position on the axis of your index finger. If your fingers werethe vector axes of the vector space, your index finger would be an"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 125eigenvector (it is unchanged) while your thumb is not (it changes). Nowrotate your index finger up or down vertically on the axis of your thumb.In this operation your thumb is now an eigenvector (it is unchanged)and your finger not (as it moves). The motion of your hand is an operation,measurement is an operation in which only the ‘stationary vectors’ havefixed measurable values, while the moving vector does not. The directionof the index finger up or down is a random event and defines theoutcome of the measurement as say ‘up spin’ or down spin’. This is thecore of what the maths of Matrix Mechanics is describing. The restbasically consists of a more detailed description, one that dovetails intothat large array of equations that constitute physics as a whole. Thiscore formulation describes why a particle whose momentum is measuredhas no position until a position measurement is made. It also describeshow the measured position will have a random outcome based on aprobability formula. Wave mechanics essentially describes the samething, but actually represents the probability curve in a mathematicalwave description. A wave that has direct correlations with theelectromagnetic waves involved, being based on a probability that isobjective or deterministic, rather than subjective or epistemic. Finallywe need to mention the phenomena of entanglement, where theoperational result on one object simultaneously affects the another inthe same complex system or two ‘linked systems’. This can bedemonstrated by performing the hand maneuver with two hands, withthe thumbs touching and the index fingers pointing in opposite directions.This systemical connection seems to suggest the two objects areinterconnected in someway, however they can be light years apart intime and space - a fact that arguably indicates a non-local acausal relationif not a holistic underpinning of the cosmos. That’s quantum mechanics"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"126 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4in a nutshell, or at least all of it needed for the purposes of this paper (amore detailed but simplified outline of the formalism can be found onby website, see bibliography). The process modeled by Matrix Mechanicsis not really a conceptual problem, however what all this actually meansontologically is a huge problem!Quantum Mechanics and ConsciousnessThe most obvious response to the so called ‘problem of measurement’in QM is to assume that a measurement is an observation or a perception.Indeed this idea was first put forward Eugene Wigner in 1960, “Mychief scientific interest in the last 20 years has been to somehow extendtheoretical physics into the realm of consciousness — consciousness isbeautifully complex. It has never been properly described, certainly notby physics or mathematics” (Cited in Szanton 1992, p 309). He arguedthat consciousness was the key factor in the act of measurement. Thatis the effect of measurement on an observed system is the effect ofconsciousness on it, or that the properties of an object need to beperceived in order to exist. This seems fair enough, how can one measurean event without observing it and so being conscious of it? But wehave to be very careful with this as the situation is not as straight forwardas this view might imply. For some the basic notion that ‘propertiesrequire observation’ implies the Berkleyan notion that ‘to be is to beperceived’, and from there leap head long into the absurdities ofontological idealism. Worse still this has been taken onboard by NewAgers who believe ‘we create our own reality through our perceptions’.The easiest counter argument to such a patently false notion would beto throw its proponents out of very high window and ask them toperceive gravity differently. Fortunately we don’t have to take such drastic"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 127steps to reveal that this view is misguided. The simple fact is that evenobjects in superposition are ‘real’ in some way, as they react with eachother and with defined particles according to the same laws applicableto any particle. They just appear to be in a ‘ghost-like’ state that enablesthem to be in two places at once, and do apparently impossible things,such as appearing from nowhere and just as mysteriously disappearingagain. If consciousness does anything at all it merely modifies the stateof the object, fixing it into a definable classical one. But there is noempirical indication that the final results of this ‘random fixation’ are inanyway influenced by consciousness. Therefore consciousness does notappear to have any influence on the actual outcome, which remainsentirely probabilistic. But beyond this it is by no means certain thatconsciousness is involved in a determinating operation such asmeasurement anyway, which may be one observed type amongst manyother observer less operations. Worse, even if it was we would then befaced by the question of ‘whose consciousness and why’ which maylead us towards solipsism. The alternative view is that the key factor inmeasurement is the quantum object’s connection with the wider world,by becoming part of an interactive system that includes the measuringdevice, it’s operator and their entire environment. It is quite possiblethat other operations that involve connecting the quantum system witha larger macro-system might also have the same effect as measurement,even when consciousness is not present. However this is difficult todemonstrate experimentally as all experiments involve observation atone stage or another. Thus the properties of a system would only existby virtue of a set of holistic relations."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"128 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4Another closely related idea to this is that of the ‘wave function collapse’.As said earlier the wave function is basically a complex variablecontaining all the possible superimposed states of an object or system,as well as their respective probabilities. When a defining operation suchas a measurement is performed the wave function is sometimes said tohave ‘collapsed’, meaning the wave function is no longer applicable tothe situation, as the state of the object is now determinate and classicaland no longer in superposition. Here the measurement operation, andoften consciousness, is typically said to have ‘collapsed the wavefunction’. However what this means is by no means clearly understood.This shift from probability to certainty is sometimes said to simplyrepresent a change in our awareness of the situation, however as wehave already observed the wave function only makes sense if it codesan objective probability (the likelihood of an indeterminate situationbecoming the case) not a subjective one the likelihood of a belief beingtrue, which implies a determinate situation), so this purely cognitiveinterpretation of probability does not seem to fit the picture. Themathematics represents actual situations not mere knowledge ofsituations.Part of the motivation for this belief in a ‘collapse’ is the commonsense assumption that quantum mechanics (perhaps) applies at themicro-level and classical mechanics definitely applies at the macro-level,with some cut off point between them. Thus either the connectionbetween the quantum system and the wider world brings it into theclassical domain, or alternatively consciousness does the trick, and thewave function is no longer representational. However there is nothingin the core mathematical formalism of QM to suggest any demarcation"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 129between quantum and classical domains, it is simply introduced as a‘fiddle factor’ in the equations, the so called ‘correspondence principle’which indexes the wave equation to Planck’s constant (which definesthe smallest quanta2), thus solely linking it to quantum scales. There isno reason why this should be the case however. Thus the principle isquite contrary to the descriptive elements of the equation which attemptto map a bizarre set of data, in that it does the opposite and tries topreserve ‘common sense’. Many contemporary interpretations of QMthus reject this and argue that the formalism applies at every scale eventhe macro-level. The real mystery is in this view why large objects donot behave as weirdly as quanta, and many speculative reasons havebeen posited. The whole idea of the ‘wave function collapse’ is nowoften rejected and rightly in my opinion. If an equation in physicsdescribes an objective situation it always does so, the mathematicallaws do not change according to perspective or scale. After allSchroedinger’s equation is essentially a variant on Newtonian laws, asis Relativity Theory, and it would be bizarre to say these are changedaccording to scale, mass or statistics (this should not be mistaken for anignorance of Relativity Theory, as we are talking of the consistency ofthe laws themselves not their application or form). Thus the wavefunction almost certainly constantly applies and never ‘collapses’. I wouldsuggest this seems a basic truism from our understanding of the closeparallelism between mathematics and physics.Two closely related interpretations of QM currently incorporate thisnon-collapse assumption, referred to as so-called Relative State Theoriesby Hugh Everett.3 One is the Many Worlds Theory, the other isDecoherence Theory. The way the first model represents this is well"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"130 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4known, the wave function always applies to the universe as a whole,but the universe is a multiverse, it branches into alternative possibilitiesand we can only exist in one. From an internal perspective each of thecomponents of the wave function is instantiated in a world of its own,and we only experience one world. When a measurement is made wethus enter one of several ‘parallel alternative worlds’. Whether theuniverse splits, our minds do, or reality itself does, varies betweendifferent versions of this theory. There are several reasons this approachis popular, apart from doing away with wave collapse, one is the potentialfor bridging quantum mechanics and Relativity, the other is that it isentirely Realist. A Realist metaphysics in which conscious plays no roleand the world is entirely physical and causally closed to the mind. Realismis still the dominant metaparadigm amongst Physicists, a paradigm shiftfrom classical to quantum physics is one thing, but a metaparadigmshift in the deepest metaphysical assumptions of science is quite another!The branching of worlds is purely a mechanical process in which all thepotential futures split off from each other and our awareness randomlyfollows one timeline. It is perplexing and not a little irritating to readsome New Agers take up this idea of the multiverse and give it theircharacteristic Idealist spin, as if our minds choose the future world,something very far from the truth. But this theory is not without itsproblems. What the branching actually means, and how separate branchescan interact, and later remerge, is a mystery that seems to add evenmore confusion to the situation. The popular idea of parallel universesor space-times is totally absurd, and not what any serious physicistbelieves at all. Interaction across disconnected spaces being impossibleas there is no continuum or medium between them. It is rather as ifsome abyss opens up between the alternative states of a system, and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 131seems to imply some non-space on which the branches supervene, andwithin which neither classical nor quantum laws could apply. This wouldobviously seem to make the ‘branches’ incapable of causally interactingand they most definitely can, as numerous experiments havedemonstrated. Another serious misgiving many have with this theory isthat it implies an infinite or innumerable number of parallel worlds,something that seems excessive even to the most ardent critics ofparsimony and energy conservation!One thing is certain, ‘magic’ would not function within its context. Thismay not be the case with Decoherence Theory however. This secondthesis is a little harder to grasp, essentially it says that superposition,and all the quantum weirdness that goes with it, is the normal state ofthe universe and always remains so. Classical physics is an illusion inthis model, but there really is one universe rather than a multiverse aswe shall see despite attempts that have been made to make Decoherencea mechanism within one version of the Many Worlds Theory. Whathappens in the clearest version of this interpretation is that when wemake a measurement we simply reduce the superpositional possibilitiesof the system and make a quasi-classical world more probable. This isbecause whereas conventional quantum mechanics assigns a uniquevector space to each ‘isolated’ system, the Decoherence model istheoretically rooted in unifiable vector space, where entanglement isthe norm, and spaces representing defined systems can fuse together assubspaces of a higher dimensional vector space mutually interacting.Thus when an isolated quantum micro subspace, full of superpositionalpotential, connects with a measuring device, or any other environmentalmacro subspace, it merges with it and shifts it into superposition, with"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"132 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4all the components of the new vector space combining into a muchlarger entangled array of superpositions. However the large size of thenew space disengages the superpositional elements from each other,‘spreading them out’, by entangling them with the more ‘separated’elements in the macro space, thus negating their mutual interference, orcoherence. This creates a non interfering quasi-classical situation, whichis further modified by the history of the macro system it entangles with.That is a consistent history is imposed on the measured superpositionscreating the coherent ‘classical’ world of everyday experience. Howeverall the superpositions still remain but we can only measure one consistentquasi-classical set of them with each measurement. There are an infinitenumber of such potential sets and so each measurement will be a uniquequasi-classical perspective on a single universe in eternal superposition.Whereas the previous interpretation had an observer entering one ofmany possible ‘classical’ worlds on each measurement, this one has onesuperpositional world with several possible ‘classical’ observations ofit, rather like Relativity Theory, with which it is hoped it will merge. Allthe perspectives are assumed to be ultimately consistent with each other,though simultaneously incompatible, as the quantum mechanical historyof the entire universe, its ‘quantum cosmology’, should be consistent(otherwise we have the possibility of alternative universes again). Thisis somewhat like a non-collapse version of Bohr’s Complimentarity, asingularly incompatible but mutually completing set of situations.One remaining problem with Decoherence Theory is the absence of aSuperselection rule that would predict which one of many possibleconsistent sets of histories is selected and maintain the overallconsistency. In other words why we experience a particular consistent"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 133history of the world. Some speculate on a kind of logical essentialismthat predisposes the necessity of a coherent and consistent reality, butwhy this should be so is inexplicable and smacks of a crypto-mysticalPlatonic ‘order’ that transcends everyday reality. One interestingalternative possibility however is that this relates to the AnthropicPrinciple, the idea that our very existence depends on a consistent historyin a coherent world which we ourselves thus ‘impose’ on the universe.Thus it would be the necessity of some future human situation ratherthan individual observation that figures the human into the equation.This idea currently exists only on the vaguer speculative fringes oftheoretical physics however, and so it is at this point we must leave thephilosophy of physics and embark on a more metaphysical analysis.The Metaphysics of Magic?The Anthropic Pinciple was once thought to be wild speculation insome quarters, but today seems forced on us by another consequenceof modern science. This consequence involves the mystery of the initialconditions and precise constants of our universe. It is now widelyaccepted that the constants of the equations representing natural lawsare incredibly finely tuned to form the kind of universe we exist in. Atiny difference in any one of them would make the universe unable tosupport our existence. Examples range from the charge on an electronto the cosmological constant. This has led to many to argue that such asituation could not have come about through random chance. Solutionsto this problem have been sort by invoking parallel universes and thebig bang / big crunch cycle, to argue for many sequential universes,with our universe a necessary rarity among a great many possibilities.However from our understanding of objective probability (Popper 1959)4"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"134 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4we can not really apply what appears to be a particular objective propertyof our universe, with its own laws, across all the, very different,disconnected universes, any more than we could apply NewtonianMechanics. The only recourse appears to be Theology or the AnthropicPrinciple. Personally I am convinced by the many atheistic argumentswithin the philosophical literature of the absurdity of theism and deismto believe the latter is the only option.The mystery of the particular consistency in experience posed byDecoherence theory is also found in arguments for Idealism, here someordering principle is usually posited to solve the problem, be it variousGod concepts, shared language / narrative or the ‘human collectiveconsciousness’. We seem to be faced with a similar situation with theAnthropic solution to the QM Superselection problem. Interestinglywithin Decoherence Theory it is also said that the initial conditions ofthe universe at the Big Bang must meet a certain requirement for theconsistent history theory to work and perhaps some parallel lies here.With the Anthropic Principle what all this adds up to is the idea thatour future or current existance somehow constitutes a telos or goaltowards which the past has been drawn. Such teleology has been madeunpopular by historicist theories which claim to be able to determinesuch a telos, however this is not a necessary part of the theory, and Iwill argue does not apply here. How the telos works depends on thenature of the universe, a deterministic, finite cosmos might have an‘omega point’ towards which events are directed, a less deterministicmodel might have several possible ‘omega points’ whose probabilitychanges with events, while an infinite cosmos might have many teloithat form a chain of teleological focal points stretched out in time."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 135Whatever the case, the telos reaches back with reverse causation, a realpossibility in a quantum cosmology, to engineer the very events thatlead to those existances. Such a state of affairs being perceived by anysituated observer as a mysterious historical process leading towards acertain end result. From a magical point of view one necessarycomponent of the world is ‘free will’ of course, and to account for thisa multiplicity of possible time-lines must be taken into account, andthe less deterministic variety of the principle adopted. Such time-lineswould probably manifest as a series of coincidences, such as theconvenient extinction of the dinosaurs, a kind of purposefulsynchronicity. With which we seem to already be approaching a magicalviewpoint. Whether all this requires the temporary presence of humanity(or any other collective of sentient life forms) at time T, or whether itrequires the stronger requirement of a specific historical situation attime T depends how strong the Anthropic Principle is taken to be. Formagic to have a place in this hypothesis it would have to be very strong.One of the problems with such a strong application of the AnthropicPrinciple is that it seems to imply that certain specific future situationshave a high probability of occurring. Which would seem to indicate avery tight net of causal interactions extending in both directions acrosstime, and, given the quantum mechanical aspects, it also indicates atight net of limited acausal entanglements too. This however is quitelikely within the context of a possible form of what I would dub a Hi-Strength Anthropic Decoherence Theory (HADT), that I would suggestmay underlie any possibility of magic. Of course this is purely ametaphysical thesis, as such a theory has yet to be devised. Anothermajor problem for this kind of Anthropic Principle is the fact that it not"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"136 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4only appears to be having a reverse causal influence, or even just anacausal influence, but rather appears to be influencing the very constantsof the universe and therefore the laws of nature themselves. That is theway the pre-geometry of the universe came together to fix the constantsis also being influenced - something that seems a lot more than a causalinfluence or acausal influence. This is not only like building your ship inthe middle of the ocean, but even in the absence of any ocean! Howcould such a thing be possible? What could be the possible position thiswas performed from?What would appear to be required would be a continuum of influencebetween an ‘ordered space’ and a ‘non-ordered space’, something outsidethe range of causation under natural laws of any kind. An obvious answeris a greater dimensionality, a ‘higher dimensional space’ in which orderemerges, a stratification running from the pre-geometry of the universeto the realm of quantum mechanics and the probability laws, down tothe quasi-classical level of a unified set of consistent histories andapparent classical reality. Such a dimension might be considered a logoicdimension, one in which order emerges to fit the end result defined bythe telos under the control of a logos or ordering principle. Theteleological influence would thus be working backwards along the timeaxis, shaping events and defining the consistent histories, andsimultaneously acting along the logoic axis defining the mode of orderingof those events. Including the ‘random’ structuring of space-time frompre-geometry that defines those mysterious constants and the nature ofthe ordered universe. Such a higher dimensionality would be visualisableas a projected hypercube (either with the time dimension ignored or thefirst three space dimensions collapsed into a 2D ‘flatland’), in which"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 137the ‘pre-ordered’ domain was the ‘outer cube’ and the ‘inner cube’ therealm of ordinary physics. It also likely that this ‘pre-ordered’ domainalso corresponds at least in part to the quantum realm that makes upthe universe as a whole. Because what is interesting then is that ahypercube can be more easily analyzed by way of a set of 3D crosssections which produce self contained geometric forms, and such amathematical approach seems close to the quasi-classical perspectivaldomains isolated from the quantum universe through measurement. Itis also not hard to see a parallel in this with David Bohm’s theories (seeendnotes), and this approach could be a way of combining Bohmianand Decoherent Models. However there is still a missing factor in allthis if the both events and order are shaped by the telos, what is itbefore these realities are shaped? In imagining a Anthropic universebased on (a)causation alone we can overcome the linear time paradoxby positing a bootstrap cosmos within quantum mechanical framework,but when we talk about an influence of a pre-ordered universe wearguably have a completely different situation. One in which at leastpart of the telos must lie outside of the ordered physical universe ofspace-time in order to interact in a hypothetical logoic dimension. Butwhat could be the nature of this existance?The solution I would suggest, is one that also makes a scientific theoryof magic possible. That is the extra dimension hypothesized above maybe identical to the fourth or fifth dimension suggested by P D Ouspenskyin 1912, in his controversial work Tertium Organum - in other words, adimension of consciousness. Contemporary Philosophy of Mind nowtakes very seriously the possibility of a non-reductive, panpsychic theoryof ‘potential awareness’ (many of us would in fact suggest this is the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"138 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4only rational possibility given the evidence. See Chalmers 1996). Oneway of making sense of this would be to posit that the very capacity ofobjects in space-time (‘us’ for instance) to have ‘qualitative experiences’is through the medium of an extra dimension of consciousness in whichsuch things exist. That is just as within an Einsteinian view of space-time an object can exist in a certain spatial coordinate, but not ‘exist forus’ until it also exists in our temporal coordinates (the block theory ofspace-time), so might an object exist in space-time but not ‘exist for us’until it exists in our consciousness, that is within our consciouscoordinates within an extra dimension. Ouspensky explores suchpossibilities in the early chapters of his book, as well as relating this toa Neo-Kantian phenomenal conception of reality (though unfortunatelyhe later drifts off into some bizarre speculations based on this insight).But within the context of quantum Physics it could be said that thedifference between being or not being in our conscious coordinates isidentical to the domains of quantum superposition, i.e. reality, and thequasi-classical domain of consistent history. Thus the idea of adimension of consciousness begins to sound very much like the logoicdimension postulated earlier. An important note to make here is this isnot a conscious coordinate based on perception, as is deployed in the‘observer effect’ of a single measurement, it would be based on acollective cognition or awareness of reality based on belief systems. Orto put it another way on the ‘information field’ of this dimension (akinto the gravity field of normal space). Such a field may correspond towhat Bohm called the ‘information field’ of the super-implicate order.Thus the measurement itself, as Decoherentists rightly claim would notneed an observer, and a measurement may be only one form ofDecoherence, however the consistency necessary for a HADT type"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 139theory would require a shared cognitive information field to order it,and that field could reside in an extra dimension of shared consciousness- the ultimate origin of that information field being the telos of theAnthropic Principle. Empirical indications that this might be the caserange from the effects of mind on probability distribution recorded bythe famous MIT experiment and the alleged effect of scientific consensuson the ‘impossible’ crystallization of glycerine.5 It should be noted thatwith this hypothesis we might also close the gap between subjectiveand objective interpretations of probability, where subjective beliefincludes conceptual and cultural ‘possibilities’, as the gap between beliefand actuality narrows to a hair’s breadth in this model.Admittedly this is a bold hypothesis and as yet underdeveloped, howeverit may be a fertile starting point for a more detailed scientific researchprogram. One of the interesting and testable things about is that itperhaps also facilitates a bridge between a Decoherence Theory, firmlyrooted in the quantum mechanical formalism, and the more speculativeinsights of David Bohm with his Implicate and Explicate Orders. For itto be a serious theory of course it would need to be formalized. Thisposes a serious problem however with the full extent of the hypothesis,in that how could the content of a dimension of consciousness berepresented? It is not hard to see how the mysterious subspace baseshift in Matrix mechanics could be tied into an entanglement with anothersubspace in a higher dimensional vector space, but the exact result ofthe entanglement remains random in this formalism. It may be that thiswould be the limit of science a mysterious pseudo-randomness thatactually masked a hidden order that could not be represented in anyformalism. Even if we extended the Four Dimensional Space Operator"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"140 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4from a 4 x 4 array to a 5 x 5 array it is hard to see how this could help. Intheory there may well be a way of codifying the effects of the extradimension on the mechanics but the system would be so complex as tobe incalculable. A typical chaos / complexity theory situation. Normallywhen this situation is met science turns to modeling and simulacra ratherthan calculation, but here we may have to model the entire timeline ofthe universe which would be quite hard to say the least. Science mayhave to eventually accept its limits and embrace an essential mystery. Apossible limited formulation might involve subteloi however. Given thatthere will be an indefinite number of paths between now and any finaltelos, or teloi, we might speculate that a number of subteloi may existalong these paths. This would be like the various routes we could takebetween say Charing Cross (now) and Kings Cross (the telos) on theLondon Underground with a variety of lines used and stations (subteloi)passed through. We could project a range of possible future subteloisay a fraction of a second in the future and formalize these through afifth Dimension, however this would still be a probabilistic solution.But how does all this relate to magic? Well in terms of cosmology it isnot hard to imagine the extra dimension of consciousness as beingequivalent to the entity Occultists have poetically referred to as theAstral Plane, the Imaginal or the Dreamworld etc. It is highly temptingto equate the quantum realms of this dimension with these occult ideas,as well as with the more modern concept of the Collective Unconscious.Of course such imaginative speculations, though fascinating, wouldhave to be constrained to fit the logical consequences of any moredeveloped HADT formulation. Given this speculation however a morepractical explanation of magic arises, one in which the teleology of a"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 141HADT model was being exploited. If as seems likely one or more teloiin history are shaping and drawing events in particular directions,perceived as synchronicities by participants in these timelines, and thatthis influence is operating in part through an extra dimension ofconsciousness, than any manipulations of this extra dimension wouldmodify the directions such timelines take. In other words we may havethe ability to generate subteloi that steer events in a certain direction,that is create synchronicities, within the context of the overall telos.This raises problems for the testability of magic however, as from anexperimental perspective any ‘magical effect’ would appear as a set ofrandom coincidences and the causal factors themselves would be entirelyexplicable by relatively conventional physics. A testable consequenceof this theory however might be the failure of magic to avert a majorhistorical event, if we commited to the hypothesis of ‘real magic’ as anexperimental stance. The deviation from the primary teleology mightbe too great. Given known magical techniques it seems likely thatsubteloi might be generated by the imagination but need some form of‘mental energy’ to actualize them. This could be compared with theindentation of space-time by gravity and the amount of energy requiredto do this. Images in the fifth dimension might be understood as anequivalent ‘indentation’ or ‘impression’ in a malleable medium requiringenergy. The energy concerned from studies of magic (Austin OsmanSpare’s orgasmic sigils and abstinence practice, and the infamous blackfast of witchcraft) seems to be one of great psychological tension orwill, and often is linked to a necessity for survival, the black fast beingan obvious example, but addiction might be another (one ponders onthe potential of ‘crack magic’!). This might indicate that the drivingforce of the teleology is indeed the necessity of survival however"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"142 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4perceived. Such an idea would not be far from the necessary humanexistence postulated by the Anthropic Principle, which if taking theform of a particular outcome, as necessary in this theory, might wellrequire the existence of a certain pre-existence of precursor events andancestors. Such metaphysical speculation could go on and on, but itwould be folly to get too far ahead of the useful limits of our, laggingbut crucial, experimental physics.In conclusion I would sum up the essence of this paper by saying contraryto popular philosophical prejudices there is really nothing ‘impossible’about magic within the context of modern science. Whether the thesisoutlined here is true or partly true or false, it at the very leastdemonstrates a possible mechanism for magic within contemporaryphysics and a starting point for a more detailed philosophical analysis,within what might be dubbed the Philosophy of Magic, and perhaps aneventual scientific research program.Endnotes1. The term Metaparadigm, or Metadigm in popular usage, refers to themore stable paradigmal assumptions shared by different Kuhnianparadigms. For example both the Newtonian and Einsteinian Physicsparadigms are Classical in nature, while both Relativity Theory and theMany Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics adopt a Realistmetaphysical foundation. It is much harder for Scientific Revolutions toshift metaparadigms than paradigms.2. Planck’s Constant is a consequence of early Quantum Theory, thediscovery that energy was not emitted continuously from objects butrather in continual quantifiable bursts of radiation. The smallest burstbeing the size of this constant, and all other values being multiples of it.This was explained in terms of EM energy particles, or photons. It wassubsequently found the subatomic particles also correspoded to thisscale, which was thus defined as the smallest possible size for any entity."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 143Planck’ Constant thus featured legitimately in many subatomic andelectromagnetic equations.3. I have excluded one other possibility here the Implicate Order Theoryof David Bohm, as like many I feel its significance is as yet unclarified,and following Bohm’s death such clarification may be a long timecoming. Though reference is made to it in conclusion so a basicunderstanding will be useful. Essentially Bohm argues that theprobabilistic wave function describes an ontological wave of propensity,a ‘force’ which governs the distribution, movement and localization ofparticles. Moreover such ‘waves’ are manifestations of a universal ‘field’that governs such probabilities in the same way light waves are anoscillation in an electromagnetic field. Beyond this the particles that aredetermined by this field are in fact a localized ‘unfolding’, ormanifestation, in what Bohm calls the explicate (directly connectingcausal) order, of an ‘enfolded’ or hidden holistic order, universallyextended in spacetime as an implicate (indirectly connecting acausal)order, that is experienced as non-local relations of entanglement andpropensity. The ‘universal field’ is regarded as a way of modeling howthe implicate order unfolds as the explicate order. Bohm thus appears toimply that each photon is a local manifestation of a universalelectromagnetic field, and all photons essentially manifestations of thatone field, and so universally interconnected through it, and that electronshave the same relation to a universal electric field, and so on into unifiedfield theory. With the ‘implicate field’ being the primary foundation ofthese, as well as the source of propensity. He describes how particlesunfold from this field through metaphors of vortexes and mostdetailedly through the example of an ink drop suspended in a containerof glycerine, that can be stirred anti-clockwise, thus defusing the dropand making it disappear into the glycerine, but can also then be stirredclockwise making the inkdrop reappear, its order or structure havingbeen secretly ‘preserved’ diffusely in the solution. These ideas arefascinating and arguably aesthetically appealing, however Bohm fails toexplicitly relate these metaphors to the formalism of quantummechanics, the core of the the physics, or any other foundational model,other than to say that the wave function refers to the implicate order andclassical physics to the explicate order (and perhaps to imply the vortexof unfoldment is related to the rotational parallels of measurement.Remember the hand rule). He does say that the idea was inspired by"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"144 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 4Green’s Function, an acknowledged part of quantum mechanics,however inspired and derived are too different things. Instead he merelyuses them to describe his intuitive understanding of quantumphenomena. Where he does use mathematical formalization to describehis theory the maths just appear to be algebraic definitions of hismetaphors, notably the defusing inkblot. For this reason he has had littleimpact on mainstream physics and more importantly what all thesemetaphors are supposed to actually represent within established physicsis very unclear.4. Karl Popper demonstrated that Physics required a singular objectivemeasure of probability to completely model events. Before thisprobability was either measured in terms of subjectivity (how certain wewere in our knowledge) or objectively, but collectively, in the FrequencyTheory (which formulated the ‘rules’ of probabality, i.e those stating thefamiliar averaging of heads and tails for large numbers of coin throws).But Physics required individual probabilities for singular ‘random’ events,to explain which required the concept of Propensity. That is forexample a coin has a ‘tendency’ to be either heads or tails and thismanifests evenly over time. Popper argued if this theory matches reality,as it appeared to, this propensity was very much like any force of naturethat determined a physical result. Thus Probability had ‘natural laws’.5. The mystery around the crystallisation of glycerine is still controversial.The phenomena was first popularly reported in the book Lifetides byLyall Watson. In this account liquid glycerine was regarded asuncrystalisable until 1923, when it was found in crystalline state by chancein various locations, Watson highlights a dramatic tale of a ship carryliquid glycerine being caught in storm which seemed to catalyze thecrystallization. On the news of this reaching other scientists, and inparticular of crystal samples reaching them, Glycerine suddenly becomescrystalisable, despite previously failed attempts, Watson claims in onecase, “that soon after their first crystals arrived in the mail and were usedsuccessfully for inducing crystallization in an experiment on one sampleof glycerine, all the other glycerine in their laboratory began to crystallizespontaneously, despite the fact that some was sealed in airtightcontainers” (p 47). This story has been used to support claims such ofthose made by Rupert Sheldrake in his now discredited MorphogeneticFields theory, however the key point is that it is the knowledge of andbelief in the crystallization that triggers the possibility of crystallization."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Issue 4 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 145However things are not this simple, skeptics have pointed out that thecrystallization could have easily occurred through the seeding ofglycerine by microscopic fragments of the mailed crystals, whetherpurposefully or accidentally. The issue turns on the details of the events,and unfortunately Watson relies on an ambiguous paper in a rare Journalof Chemistry published in 1923 as his only factual source (this wasformerly available on the Internet but no longer seems to be available).The sober paper roughly corresponds to Watson’s more dramaticaccount, but simply says glycerine crystallized within ‘sealed containers’.No reference is made to their air tightness or whether they had beenpreviously opened. Read through a conservative mindset this is not aconclusive case therefore. Though does correspond to less dramatic andscientifically documented anecdotes of a similar nature. The case is thusstill open. The MIT experiment is well known and involved a cascadeof ball bearings being allowed to freely drop one at a time and form aphysical even probability curve within a precisely engineered sealedmechanism designed to create this effect. Experimental subjects wereasked to concentrate on the mechanism and attempt to change theprobability curve. According to the experimenter’s conclusions a veryslight shift was detected.ReferencesA Popular Science Essay on Anthropic Principle and Constants, 2005, [On-line], http://www.2001principle.net/2005.htmAlbert, D.Z. ,1992, Quantum Mechanics and Experience, Harvard UniversityPress, Cambridge, MA.Ash, Steve, 2006, Matrix Mechanics for Dummies, [On-line], http://blackcatpress.co.uk/QM/QMintro.htmBarrow, John and Tipler, Frank, 1986, The Anthropic Cosmological Principle,OUP, Oxford.Bohm, D.,1980, Wholeness and the Implicate Order, Routledge, London.Chalmers, D., 1996, The Conscious Mind, OUP, Oxford.DeWitt, B.
