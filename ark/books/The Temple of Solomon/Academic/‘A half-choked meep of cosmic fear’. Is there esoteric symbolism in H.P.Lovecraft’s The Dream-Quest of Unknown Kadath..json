They include Aleister Crowleys heir, Grant and his followers inEngland; Michael Aquino, Anton La Vey and Michael Bertiaux in the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 177USA; and Wolfgang Muller in Germany, who dubs Lovecraft TheAlchemist of Providence, and sees him as an adept of the highest rank.I have always found this intriguing but unsubstantiated, feeling thatthese occultists were reading into Lovecraft things that he would nothave been aware of, and indeed would have denied any knowledge of.John Gonce (2003, p 85) discusses the apparent reluctance of Lovecraftscholars to consider HPLs knowledge of the occult, leaving a lacuna inwhich occultists can wildly speculate. In what follows I shall suggestthat a reading of The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath raises the intriguingpossibility that Lovecraft was aware of the symbolism of occultism; ina discussion following the analysis I shall consider how well substantiatedthat claim may be.The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, according to August Derleth (1966,p 7), was very probably conceived and written ... sometime in the earlyor mid-1920s, but ... it was evidently never extensively revised. It wasnever revised, or considered a commercial proposition  it is composedunder no illusion of professional acceptance, wrote Lovecraft in a letteron 19 December 1926. As a result, we are able to study the originalimagery of The Dream-Quest. S.T.Joshis chronology (1980, p 37) datesits writing more precisely, and later, from autumn 1926 to 22 January1927. This puts it just after The Call of Cthulhu and just before The Caseof Charles Dexter Ward, part of what Burleson (1983, pp 115-160) callsthe Homecoming Burst of Creativity - the creation of the Mythos byLovecraft, back home in Providence from New York, from 1926 to1928. That period certainly shows also Lovecrafts literary interest inthe occult: The Call of Cthulhu begins with a voodoo cult in Louisiana,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"178 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3while in The Case of Charles Dexter Ward Lovecraft uses some cabbalisticincantations and the lunar nodes known as the Dragons Head and Tail.The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath is a strange and yet seminal text inthat it pulled together many themes begun in earlier short texts of thedream-cycle - Polaris, The White Ship, The Statement of Randolph Carter,The Cats of Ulthar, Celephais, Nyarlathotep, The Other Gods, The Hound,Pickmans Model. These texts are generally thought of as belonging tothe period in which Lovecraft was influenced by the Irish fantasy writerLord Dunsany, whose writings were popular following the success ofThe Gods of Pegana in 1904. If S.T.Joshis chronology is correct, itcontradicts the common perception that this Dunsanian Dreamlandsperiod was over and done with before Lovecraft began work on hisMythos cycle.As a fantasy story, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath  to adopt theterms used by Clute and Grant (1997) - takes the form of a Quest for aDark Tower, the haunt of a Dark Lord (in this case, Nyarlathotep). AsWetzel (1980, p 84) points out, while the world of The Dream-Quest is adream-world explored by the sleeping Randolph Carter, it is also anafterworld, where one might meet the dead (as one sometimes does indreams too), with both an Elysium and a Tartarus, where Carter meets,for example, King Kuranes and Pickman the ghoul, respectively. Wetzelcompares The Dream-Quest to the ancient Greek otherworld, with whichLovecraft was familiar through his reading; Dante also comes to mind -perhaps the illustrations of Gustave Dore to Dante and Milton, whichimpressed so Lovecraft as a child (letter of October 24, 1936). In termsof the Cabalah, Tartarus or Hell is represented by Olam ha-Qlippoth, the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 179world of empty shells or demons; and in some of the more unpleasantspots of Carters dreamland the Qlippoth do indeed seem to appear.An esoteric reading of The Dream-Quest of Unknown KadathUnlike Dante, Carter had no Virgil in the text of The Dream-Quest toguide him around the Dreamlands, which include sites that may bedescribed as infernal, purgatorial and even paradisal. We may perhapsbe justified in seeing Carters journey as a sort of pilgrims progress,into the sleepers subconscious mind, through various vicissitudes,temptations and dangers, until he achieves true knowledge and reacheshis own private paradise. But Carter was the persona of Howard PhillipsLovecraft, who may not have been composing as freely as we mightsuppose: in the analysis that follows, we see Carter following the Pathsbetween the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life of the Cabalah. This gives astructure to the universe of The Dream-Quest, whether it is seen as theinner space of the subconscious mind, the outer space of the ascent toand return from Kadath, the interior of the Earth, or the other world ofthe after-life - for it can be all these things. There is, however, one majoranomaly immediately obvious in this case: because it is giving a structureto the underworld, or the subconscious, the Tree of Life is growingupside-down. As Denning and Phillips (1988, p 100) say, a progressfrom the Malkuth to the Kether of the qliphothic Tree ... is really adescent ... It does lead to the Abyss. Where the Qliphothic forcesoutweigh those of the Sephiroth, their attributes distort the usualcharacter of the Sephira affected. To cite Wetzel (1980, p 84) again, Itis in the novel, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1926), that theHell of H.P.L.s Cthulhu Mythos is fully described and made the localeof a story."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"180 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3There is one other peculiarity which might be explained by the authorspsychology, not unrelated to the previous breakdown of his short-livedmarriage: there are no women, no goddesses, no females at all, not evenapparently among the animals. All the paths of the Tree of Life linkedto Tarot cards depicting female figures are somehow avoided, or notmentioned. There is, however, another explanation for this, whether aconscious or unconscious reflection of his personal situation. As Epsteinwrote in 1969, An ever-functioning system of opposites, mediated byharmony, rules over the mental and physical universe, whose newcreations emerge from their fusion. Balance and harmony throughcreation are perpetuated by means of sex. Equilibrium is thereby equatedwith love, and love is personified in the female form of the Shekinah, orthe mystery of Gods everlasting presence ... It is the absence of theShekinah that denotes the presence of evil ... if a man cuts himself offfrom God, the Shekinah will leave him to Satan, who will drag himfurther into the pit until he suffers the torments of hell in his life. In thiscase the Sephiroth are reversed and form instead a tree of death whoseroots emanate from the Kelipah (i.e. the Qlippoth) (p 26-7  my italics).The journey begins on Earth, the waking world, which is the Sephiraof Malkuth, or Kingdom. Carter is desperate to revisit and freely wandera marvellous city he has glimpsed thrice in his dreams, and prays in vainto the tyrannous, hidden gods of dream that brood capricious abovethe clouds on unknown Kadath, in the cold waste where no man treads.Finally, ... Carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man hadgone before, and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknownKadath, veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars, holds secretand nocturnal the onyx castle of the Great Ones. In light slumber he"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 181descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame ... ... and thinkingshrewdly on his course, he boldly descended the seven hundred steps tothe Gate of Deeper Slumber and set out through the Enchanted Wood(Dream-Quest p 107).The cavern of flame and the Gate of Deeper Slumber appear to be butway-stations on the Path between the Sephiroth of Malkuth and Netzach.The 70 and 700 steps may be a clue: Netzach is the seventh Sephira. Inhis Sepher Sephiroth, Aleister Crowley (1912) gives the followingequivalences in Hebrew gematria: 70=Night; 700=The Veil of the Holy;770=going forth, all of which, particularly the last, seem to beappropriate. Netzach is related in its symbolism to the planet Venus,and the Roman Venus is a typical example of the deities, usuallygoddesses, representing nature, life and fertility, which are typicalattributes of the character of Netzach. The Enchanted Wood, inhabitedby Zoogs (animals by name and nature), is thus appropriate for thiszone, as is the colour green of the trees and mossy stones, for green isthe colour of this Sephira. In the wood is a stone circle, suggesting thatthe Zoogs are perhaps the Qlippoth of Netzach, the Seirim or Satyrs.Carter parleys with the Zoogs, accepting a gourd of moon-tree wine,grown from a seed dropped down by someone on the moon. The reasonfor this reference (the word moon appears thrice here) is that the Pathbetween the Sephiroth of Malkuth and Netzach is traditionally allocatedto the Tarot trump The Moon, the image of which - a path between twotowers - may also have suggested to Lovecraft the Gate of DeeperSlumber. The card depicts drops of dew falling from the moon, whichmay have suggested the seed dropped down by someone on the moon.The Hebrew letter associated with the Path between Malkuth and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"182 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3Netzach is Qoph, meaning the back of the head, and is particularlyrelevant to Carters dreaming. As Case (1947, p 175) wrote: This is thepart of the skull which contains the ... medulla oblongata ... The cellsof this organ remain awake when the rest of the brain is asleep ... Sleepis the function assigned to Qoph. Sleep is the period ... during whichthe cells of the body undergo subtle changes which make the advancingstudent of occultism ready to experience and understand facts andphenomena concealed from ordinary men.Carter leaves the Enchanted Wood, leaving Netzach on the Path toHod, the next Sephira. At noon he walked through the one broad highstreet of Nir ... and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridgeacross the Skai ... ( A glance at the diagram of the Tree will reveal thebroad road crossing the river below: the Path from Netzach to Hod,which passes over that from Yesod to Tiphereth, represented in thestory by the River Skai. Hod (or Splendour), related to the planet Mercury,is represented by Ulthar in the story. Carter heads for that venerablecircular tower which crowns Ulthars highest hill - the Path he has justtaken is allocated to the Tarot trump of The Tower. There he conferswith the old priest Atal, who advises him to see the mountain of Ngranekin the isle of Oriab, where there is a great carved face, perhaps bearingthe features of the gods. Not knowing how to get there, he advisesCarter to follow the singing Skai under its bridges down to the SouthernSea, to the port-city of Dylath-Leen. Then twilight fell, and the pinkwalls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic ... and sweet bellspealed in the temple tower above: violet is the colour of Hod on theKing Scale, and the bell is regarded as a suitable, although not exclusive,symbol of Mercury."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 183As he admired the pleasant scene, Carter swore that Ulthar would be avery likely place to dwell in always, were not the memory of a greatersunset city ever goading one onward (Dream-Quest p 113). Thistemptation recalls the fact that, according to Denning and Phillips (1988,p 129), in its qliphothic ... aspect, Hod becomes the sphere of Samael,the Tempter of Eden.In the morning Carter joins a caravan of merchants, and for six daysthey rode on the smooth road beside the Skai ... the placid river: interms of the Tarot, Temperance, which depicts an angelic figure standingbeside a river (a road running off into the distance). (To get to this path,Carter presumably retraced his steps along the Tower path to the bridgeof Nir, but Lovecraft does not dwell on this, getting him there in oneshort paragraph). On the seventh day a blur of smoke arose on thehorizon ahead, and then the tall black towers of Dylath-Leen, which isbuilt mostly of basalt. Dylath-Leen with its thin angular towers looks inthe distance like a bit of the Giants Causeway, and its streets are darkand uninviting (Dream-Quest p 113). This is the next Sephira, Tipherethor Beauty, related to the Sun: but here, on the inverted Tree, there isneither sunlight nor beauty. Perhaps Lovecraft has left us a clue, however:Tiphereth is the sixth Sephira, and basalt forms hexagonal, six-sidedcolumns, as on the Giants Causeway in Ulster. Moreover, the journeytook six full days. The thin angular towers may even suggest the acuteangles between the many Paths that meet here.Eventually one of the black galleys docks, bringing rubies from anunknown shore, and Carter tries some moon-wine on one of themerchants who came aboard it. He is hoist with his own petard, however,for after a sip of wine from a ruby bottle he loses consciousness, and as"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"184 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3Carter slipped into blackness, the last thing he saw - but he awakes tofind himself alive and fairly well on the deck of the galley. This littledeath is not surprising when one sees that they are sailing along the Pathof the Tarot trump Death, past the charnel gardens of Zura. Moreover,according to Sturzacker (1971, p 90), On this path the student or initiateis in the sphere of the dark night of the soul commenced inTemperance. A ship is visible in the background of this card in theRider-Waite pack, as are two pylons framing the setting sun in thebackground, which might account for this:before the day was done Carter saw that the steersman couldhave no other goal than the Basalt Pillars of the West ...which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 185cataract wherein the oceans of earths dreamland drop ... andshoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and otherstars ... (Dream-Quest, p 116).The ship has now turned on to the Path of The Star, marked by a femalefigure pouring water from two jugs, and also by one large star and sevenother stars. Carter soon saw that the helmsman was steering a coursedirectly for the moon, and the Path of The Star leads directly to Yesod(or Foundation), the fifth Sephira, which is related to the moon.According to Sturzacker (1971, p 61), This path is the link betweenthe waters above the firmament and the waters below the firmamentof Genesis. Carter finds the moon to be inhabited by creatures variouslydescribed as a sort of toad, toad-things,or toadlike moonbeasts, thetoad being linked in magical symbolism with the moon. The toadlikemoonbeasts may represent the Gamaliel, or obscene ones, the Qliphothof Yesod. (Carter is then rescued by the cats of Earth and Ulthar, whospirit him back to Dylath-Leen on a furry bridge of cats, the secondtime Lovecraft sends him there in a few words).Carter is once again able to take ship for the Isle of Oriab, and for twodays they sailed eastward. They are following the Path of The Devil onthe Tree, but no reference is made to it until Carter reaches hisdestination. There he sees a wall-drawing in which there is a crowd oflittle companion shapes ... with horns and wings and claws and curlingtails, which leaves little doubt of the source of his inspiration. TheDevil card depicts not only a large traditional devil with all the attributesmentioned above, but also two smaller companions sporting horns andtails too."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"186 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3The story continues: But on the third day they turned sharply south;having sailed east and turned sharply south, they are now following thePath of The Hanged Man, which provides us with an origin for one ofLovecrafts most startling images. The ship drifts over the ruins of asunken city, clearly visible in the moonlight: ... and Carter did not blamethe sailors much for their fears. Then by the watery moonlight he noticedan odd high monolith in the middle of that central court, and saw thatsomething was tied to it. And when after getting a telescope from thecaptains cabin he saw that the bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 187of Oriab, head downward and without any eyes, he was glad that arising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea(Dream-Quest, p 123).The Hanged Man of the Tarot is also hanging upside-down, and,although it is from a tree or cross, the Golden Dawn title for the trumpis The Spirit of the Mighty Waters: it is linked astrologically to the elementWater, and also to Neptune. Oddly enough, T.S.Eliot also representsthe Hanged Man by a drowned sailor in the Death by Water section ofThe Waste Land (1922), raising the question of a possible common source.Carter then arrives at the port of Baharna in the great isle of Oriab,where mount Ngranek rises jagged and snow-crowned in the distance.This is the next Sephira, Geburah, representing strength or severity, andrelated to the planet Mars. Ngranek is an extinct volcano, thinly coveredwith ... ash trees, upon which a great carved face gleams red in thesunset. Carter has a good, curved scimitar in case of any trouble. Fire,the god Volcanus, the ash-tree, the colour red and the sword are allattributes of Mars / Geburah, as are the rubies carried by the blackgalleys on which Carter first attempted to sail here.As the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beaconsThon and Thal gleamed a welcome, and in the millionwindows of Baharnas terraces mellow lights peeped outquietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in thedusk, till that steep and climbing seaport became a glitteringconstellation hung between the stars of heaven and thereflections of those stars in the harbour (Dream-Quest, p 124)."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"188 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 189Lovecrafts description of Baharna may owe something to the Tarotcard of The Chariot, which represents the next Path he attempts totake: a glance at the card shows towers on either side, perhaps the originof the twin beacons, while the chariot is covered by a hanging awningmade of cloth covered in stars. As in the background of the card, thecity rises in great stone terraces. Moreover, a mighty warrior in hischariot is also the magical image of Geburah. On the card the chariot isdrawn by two sphinxes with zebra-striped head-dresses, which mayaccount for the fact that Carter hires first one and then another zebrafor transport. The first zebra is killed during the first night, with itsblood all sucked away through a singular wound in its throat ... and allaround on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints - signs perhapsof the Qetebim, or Destroyers, the Qliphoth of Geburah, the pestilencethat walketh in darkness.In the face carved on the far side of mount Ngranek Carter recognisesthe features of sailors he had seen (in previous dreams) in Celephais,and he decides to retrace his steps, via Dylath-Leen, the Skai, and Nirto the Enchanted Wood (i.e. via Tiphereth to Netzach), and from therenorthward along the river Oukranos to Thran, and thence to Celephais.A glance at the Tree will show that he could have taken a Path straightfrom Oriab / Geburah to Thran / Chesed. The reason why he did not isperhaps because the card linked to the Path to Chesed, Strength, featuresa lady dominating a lion: as noted above, Lovecraft has avoided femininefigures. Another reason may be that it is apparently the occult wisdomthat, according to Sturzacker (1971, p 23), The foolish rise from Hodto Geburah only to fall back, so that Carters progress at some pointsresembles a game of snakes and ladders. The question is academic, in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"190 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3any case, for Carter is whisked away from mount Ngranek by night-gaunts, which take him to the Abyss which lies between and below theSephiroth.As they flew over it, far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominouspinnacles which he knew must be the fabled Peaks of Throk. Awfuland sinister they stand in the haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths(Dream-Quest, p 131). This haunted disc of sunless and eternal depthsis the hidden, occulted Sephira of Daath (Knowledge). As the bandflew lower the Peaks of Throk rose grey and towering on all sides, andone saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impressive graniteof the endless twilight. Carter is deposited in the Abyss of the vale ofPnoth below the Peaks of Throk, but a rope-ladder lowered by his ghoulfriends enables him to climb up to the top. There the ground is scatteredwith gravestones and other sepulchral monuments filched by the ghouls,and Carter realized with some emotion that he was probably nearer thewaking world than at any other time since he had gone down the sevenhundred steps from the cavern of flame to the Gate of Deeper Slumber(Dream-Quest, p 133). Daath has a close relationship with Malkuth: inCabbalist lore, but for the Fall, the Sephira of Malkuth would be in theposition of Daath. If we imagine hinges at Hod and Netzach on thediagram of the Tree of Life, we can see how Malkuth could be easilyswung up into the position of Daath. It seems that Lovecraft envisageda three-dimensional model here: Malkuth above Daath, and Daath belowthe general level of the dreamlands, in the grey air of inner earth.Carter and a few companion ghouls surface in the city of the giantGugs: they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearlyas high as the eye could see ... and seen through aisles of monoliths,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 191was a stupendous vista of cyclopean round towers mounting upillimitable into the grey air of inner earth (Dream-Quest, p 135). Theymake their way to the biggest tower: this was the central tower withthe sign of Koth, and those stone steps just visible through the duskwithin were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamlandand the enchanted wood. (Lovecraft also speaks of the sign of Kothabove the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in the twilightin The Case of Charles Dexter Ward). They climb the spiral staircase ofthe Tower of Koth, and emerge through the exit, covered by a greatstone slab in the Enchanted Wood. No Path corresponding to this routeis visible on the Tree, but, according to Hulse (1994, p 333), there arealso sixteen invisible paths running between the Sephiroth. Thecompanions seem to have joined the one running from Inquanok / Binahto the Enchanted Wood / Netzach, which is linked to a Tarot Courtcard, the Queen of Cups: it may only be coincidence that kothon is Greekfor a drinking cup. Lovecraft may give us a clue later, too: when Carterfinally reaches Inquanok / Binah, he finds that on a hill in the centrerose a sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest ... the Temple of theElder Ones ... nothing was more splendid than the massive heights ofthe great central Temple of the Elder Ones with its sixteen carven sides(Dream-Quest, p 152-3).Back in the Enchanted Wood, Carter parts from the dog-like ghouls,shaking the paws of those repulsive beasts; thinks sadly of the zebrashe hired in far-away Oriab so many aeons ago; and helps to forestallan attack by the Zoogs on the cats of Ulthar - all of which is perhapsappropriate in the realm of Netzach, relating to natural animal life. Heleaves the Enchanted Garden this time by way of the singing river"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"192 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3Oukranos, through a flowery paradise: Carter heard only the murmurof the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walkedonward under an enchanted sun. This Path is linked to the Wheel ofFortune - the Lord of the Forces of Life - which is related to the elementof water; the descending serpent on the card may also have suggestedthe winding river. The divinatory meaning of this card is good fortuneand happiness, so it is appropriate that A blessed haze lies upon all thisregion ... so that men walk through it as through a faery place, and feelgreater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember (Dream-Quest, p 142). It is also linked by some, such as Zain (1994, p 144), withthe planet Uranus: remove the k from Oukranos and one has Ouranos,the Greek original of Uranus. In Greek Cabalah, according to Barry(1999, p 253-4) Ouranos has a value of 891; add the k, which has avalue of 20, and 911 is the value of the words for axle, wheel, joy, grace,and bloom of youth - all highly appropriate here.As the sun sets, Carter sees the white towers and gilded spires of thecity of Thran, galleons of cedar anchoring at its marble wharves: cedaris an attribute of Chesed, or Mercy, the next Sephira, which Thranrepresents. Carter does not linger, but boards a galleon bound forCelephais the following morning. They continue down the river, pastthe perfumed jungles of Kled, to the port of Hlanith on the CerenerianSea. They are taking the Path from Chesed to Chokmah, which is relatedto the Tarot trump of The Hierophant, or High Priest: it is linked to theastrological sign of Taurus, and among its attributes are naturally bullsand all other bovines, plus the Taurean quality of strength. Carter goesashore, and not surprisingly sees ox-carts, and bulls-eye panes in thetavern windows; while Hlanith is noted for its rugged granite walls and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 193oaken wharves, and is prized for the solid work of its artisans (Dream-Quest, p 145).From there they sail across the Cerenerian Sea for two nights and twodays. Then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead thesnowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slope,and Carter knew they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and themarvellous city of Celephais. This is the Sephira of Chokmah, orWisdom. Lovecraft had previously written of Celephais and its wiseruler, King Kuranes, in Celephais (1920), and in both that piece and inThe Dream-Quest he mentions the turquoise temple of the deity Nath-Horthath: turquoise is one of the gem-stones attributed to Chokmah.On the following day Carter walked up the Street of the Pillars to theturquoise temple and talked with the High Priest: the High Priest refersback to the Path just travelled from Chesed to Chokmah, that of theTarot trump of The Hierophant, or High Priest. Carter also visits theLord of Ooth-Nargai, King Kuranes, with whom we may link the Pathof The Emperor, which connects Ooth-Nargai / Chokmah with Dylath-Leen / Tiphereth. The Emperor is enthroned, just as Kuranes sat pensivein a chair; the throne is decorated with rams heads, and Carter, afterleaving the turquoise temple, had sought out the market of the sheep-butchers (Dream-Quest, p 146)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"194 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3["},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 195The colour violet is attributed to this Path, and in both texts (Celephaisand The Dream-Quest) Kuranes, who was previously a dream-questerlike Carter, meets with Sngac, a being in the form of a violet-colouredgas. This Path is also related to the element of Air, and Kuranes is alsoLord of the Sky around Serannian, where he reigns in the turreted cloud-castle of sky-floating Serannian. Likewise, Chokmah is related to Uranusas the sky or heavens, the primeval god of Greek myth rather than themodern planet: according to Bias (1997, p 17), Chokmah is ... the Sphereof the Fixed Stars ... Uranus as the Starry Heaven. Carter followed theRiver Oukranos most of the way from Netzach to Chokmah: asmentioned above, remove the k and one has Ouranos, the Greek originalof Uranus.One starlit evening, a ship from Inquanok puts in: the sailors facesresemble the face carved upon mount Ngranek, and, although excitedby this, Carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen. He didnot know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memorymight fill those children of the Great Ones. The word supernal is aninteresting choice: the three highest (or in this case lowest) Sephirothare known as supernal, and Carter is about to sail from one of them,Chokmah, to another, Binah. (The word is also used in the openingparagraph: a fanfare of supernal trumpets, and towards the end:supernal Kadath in its cold waste). The fact Carter is now in thesupernal regions is symbolised in the story by polar symbolism and Poe-like reminiscences of Arctic exporation: night came with gorgeous stars,and the dark ship steered for Charles Wain and the Little Bear as theyswung slowly round the pole ... Each day the sun wheeled lower andlower in the sky, and the mists overhead grew thicker and thicker. And"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"196 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all, only a weird grey twilight...  (Dream-Quest, p 151). There seems to be some inconsistency here:the ship should be westering, too, if our interpretation is correct, andyet Inquanok appears to the east ... perhaps, as in polar regions, thecompass has become unreliable! More to the point, it may be that theship took a long, curvaceous, route, rather than sailing straight acrossalong the Path of The Empress, since the latter is (of course) nevermentioned in any way.After a voyage lasting twenty-two days (the number of the Tarot trumpsand the visible Paths), they reach the black onyx city of Inquanok, withthe sixteen-angled tower (the number of the invisible paths) of theTemple of the Elder Ones. Although the Path just taken (or avoided) isthat of The Empress, it is not surprising, in view of Lovecrafts exclusionof the feminine from this text, that Inquanok is ruled by a Veiled King.Inquanok represents the Sephira of Binah, which is related to the planetSaturn - as are onyx and the raven, which are mentioned several times,while black is a colour related to both Binah and Saturn. As would beappropriate to Saturn, the planetary god of the seventh day, there isseptenary symbolism: the Temple garden has seven gates, seven lodges,seven doors, seven paths, and seven columns of bowl-bearing priests.Binah is known as the Great Sea, and its symbols include the cup, thechalice, the well: In the garden of the great central Temple of the ElderOnes there are fountains, pools and basins ... all of onyx and having inthem small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers ofocean (Dream-Quest, p 151).But always to the east ... rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless andimpassable peaks across which the hideous Leng was said to lie.

He seesonly the miners and an occasional raven, but is pursued and abductedby a squat slant-eyed trader of evil legend who had spied on him inDylath-Leen and Inquanok, leading on a noxious horde of leeringShantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the netherpits. The Shantak-birds - huge, horse-headed scaly flying beasts thatlurk in caves in the mountain-sides - are a form of Qlippoth. Accordingto Denning and Phillips (1988, p 103), The Cohorts of the Qlippothbeyond the Abyss are collectively known as the Sataroth, or Concealers... the Sataroth have been compared to huge, foul, voracious birdsbrooding on the slimy and fog-covered steeps of an unscaleable cliff.Mounted upon a shantak, Carter and his captor fly over that hauntedplace of evil and mystery which is Leng ... finally they came to a wind-swept table-land which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantlessworld. Seeing a squat windowless building, around which a circle ofcrude monoliths stood ... Carter surmised from old tales that he wasindeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places, the remoteand prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the High-Priest not to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask over itsface. The High-Priest represents The Magician, the Tarot trump relatedto the Path just taken, from Inquanok / Binah to Leng / Kether; itssymbolic colour is yellow. Kether is the topmost Sephira (polarity havingchanged), and thus may be seen as the very roof of a ... world. In thenormal Tree of Life, Kether is the Crown, the fountainhead of all good;here, in this infernal Tree, it may fairly be described as that most dreadfuland legendary of all places. Instead of light, we have a windowless"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"198 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3building, which is encircled by monoliths: a point within a circle is asymbol of Kether. There were no lights inside, so, ironically, a lamp,which is also a symbol of Kether, is mentioned several times in thisepisode, being much needed in the prevailing darkness (Dream-Quest, p161).Carter escapes from his captor and reaches Sarkomand, the city ofdreadful night on the coast of Leng. Here he meets up again with theghouls, and together they defeat more of the moonbeasts. The ghoulsand their night-gaunt allies agree to escort him on the final stage of hisjourney from Leng to Kadath, approaching unknown Kadath eitherthrough the desert of carven mountains north of Inquanok, or throughthe more northerly reaches of repulsive Leng itself. Crossing the GreatAbyss to the Supernal Sephiroth changes polarity, so that what wasformerly south is now north, as Lovecraft makes abundantly clear:Everything focused toward the north; every curve and asterism of theglittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurryfirst the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret andterrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretchedendlessly ahead (Dream-Quest, p 180).As they fly north, they pass a range of mountains, carved into shapesby no human hand: All in a great half-circle they squatted, those dog-like mountains carven into monstrous watching statues ... It was onlythe flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads tomove ... ... There they squatted in a hellish half-circle ... sinister, wolf-like and double-headed (Dream-Quest, p 179). Soon they notice to theirhorror  bringing to the lips of the ghouls a half-choked meep of cosmicfear - that these gigantic beings have got to their feet and are paralleling"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 199their course. This striking image of Lovecrafts has a cabalistic origin:as Waite (1924, p 256) makes clear: Thaumiel, the doubles of God,said to be two-headed and so named, because they pretend to be equalto the Supreme Crown. This is properly the title of the averse Sephiracorresponding to Kether.It also becomes clear that Kadath cannot be located on the Tree, sinceLeng was apparently located in the utmost Sephira of Kether. Kadathmust then be identified with the next element, the Ain Soph Aur, theLimitless Light, the Radiant Darkness in the words of Bias (1997, pxxii): but once again in this inverted Tree it is the opposite: a realm ofeternal night, as Lovecraft takes pains to emphasise:At length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead,thereafter rising steadily as they approached, and havingbeneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars. Carter sawthat it must be some beacon on a mountain, for only amountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious aheight in the air ... Higher and higher rose the light and theblackness beneath it, till half the northern sky was obscuredby the rugged conical mass ...No mountain known of man wasthat which loomed before them ... Scornful and spectralclimbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven, black in eternalnight, and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars ... Ghoulsmeeped in wonder as they saw it (Dream-Quest, p 182).The description plainly shows that Kadath is no earthly mountain, butis, like Mount Meru, the great mythical mountain in the north whichrepresents the polar axis, here conflated with the Ain Soph Aur, on the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"200 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3edge of infinity: hence the increased power of the writing, striving toexpress what is inexpressible except in the language of symbolism.DiscussionThe above analysis of The Dream-Quest seems at first sight to indicatethat Lovecraft was familiar with some of the symbolic structures ofmodern magic: the Tree of Life of the Cabalah, with the system ofmapping the Tarot (specifically, the Rider-Waite pack) on to the Pathsof the Tree, and with some of the associated symbolism: attributessuch as colours, animals, plants, stones, artifacts, astrological signs, andnumbers. In addition, he appears to have been cognisant with the systemof gematria (i.e. the numerical values) of both Greek and Hebrew letters,and also with the Qlippoth, the demons of the Cabalah.On the other hand, it must be admitted that such an interpretation isinevitably based on a selective reading of the text, choosing what fitsand omitting from consideration what does not. Are we simply seeingpictures in the fire, shapes in the clouds, canals on Mars? It could beargued that the Tree of Life and its modern occult accretions form apoetic model of the universe which naturally includes everything, so itis not surprising if we find what we are looking for. Structuralistinterpretations of this kind are now seen as problematic, in that manypossible structures can be deduced from a reading of a text. Positingthe existence of any one structure within some material can influencethe interpretation and hence its outcome.In response it could be argued that some of Lovecrafts most arrestingimages appear to have an esoteric origin: the Hanged Man / drowned"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 201sailor, and the mountainous two-headed Thaumiel, for instance. Inaddition to such isolated images, there appears to be a fair amount ofconsistency in the overall structure (which we have identified with theTree and Tarot), as when Carters ship sails east and turns sharply south,on to the Path of the Hanged Man. True, there is not always a total fit,but the story can be mapped onto the structure to quite a large extent how large is a matter of opinion.Some might object that the bleak mechanistic and materialistic view ofthe universe which Lovecraft espoused in his letters contradicts thetheodicy, the providential cosmology implicit in the Tree of Life as apoetic structure of the universe. Our interpretation, however, postulatesan inverse, Qliphothic version of the Tree, in which the universe canindeed be seen as one bereft of providence, order, meaning, love andhope - until Carter (and Lovecraft) are rescued by a return to their rootsin New England - Carter in Boston, and Lovecraft (of course) inProvidence.Another objection to such a Cabbalistic interpretation is that it couldbe applied to any science fiction or fantasy novel. Perhaps we shouldtake two other Quests for Dark Towers as the closest candidates forcomparison: J.R.R.Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings and Stephen Kingsseries The Dark Tower (I have not yet finished studying the final twovolumes). The results are intriguing, but much less convincing than forThe Dream-Quest. In Tolkien, for example, the Elven-kings have threerings, the Dwarf-lord seven; mortal men have nine, the Dark Lord one:twice ten, the same number as the sephiroth on a double Tree of Life,one normal and one infernal. King has a structure reminiscent of theTree - a Beam that the companions follow towards the Dark Tower,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"202 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3which at one point crosses an Abyss, and he also has an idiosyncraticand partial version of the Tarot. Various locations can be tentativelymapped onto the Tree, especially the lower sephiroth, but with manyquestion marks. Tolkiens city of Minas Tirith and Kings City of Ludmay be seen as the equivalents of Dylath-Leen on the sephira ofTiphereth, for example. Minas Tirith was originally Minas Anor, theTower of the Sun, while Lud is at one point associated with the rose-pink colour of Tiphereth (on the King Scale!). It is difficult, however,to map either text on to the Tree very consistently or convincingly. Thismay be due to the complexity of these multi-volume epic-romances,with many journeys by different characters. It would seem, however,that neither author was following the same magical pattern that wesuggest Lovecraft was; this not surprising, for why should a good Catholiclike Tolkien or King, writing a generation or two later, be expected todo so? It might be better, in any case, to regard the mythopoetic structuresthat they do have as their own cabbalas or symbolic systems.While many works of fantasy and science fiction can be analysed alongdifferent lines - psychoanalytical, apocalyptic, sociological, archetypal -they do not all yield to a Cabbalistic interpretation as well as The Dream-Quest does. Some do not seem at all fruitful, whatever the level ofanalysis: much fantasy appears to be literary whimsy only - not thatthere is anything necessarily wrong with that. An interesting comparisoncan be made with Brian Lumley, who seems to follow Lovecraftsgeography of the Dreamlands pretty faithfully in his Dreams series, butappears to have no esoteric awareness or resonance: except for thefollowing quotation, which suggests he might unwittingly have stumbledupon the possible Cabbalistic structure of The Dream-Quest: A tale of"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 203paths between the spheres, dim corridors leading to equally dim andconjectural lands of elder myth ... (1978, p 10). Unless, of course, MrLumley knows more than he is letting on ... Another comparison couldbe with Lovecrafts mentor Poe, who displays a similar apparentcontradiction, between the author of Eureka and the author of his fiction.If we grant that The Dream-Quest may contain a possible Cabbalisticstructure, more than other texts, the question arises as to why Lovecraft,if he knew what he was doing, never (to our knowledge) admitted to it,and instead usually maintained an attitude of scepticism and evenignorance towards such matters. This is a major objection to ourhypothesis, and one that is perhaps ultimately unanswerable until someother evidence may be found to support or refute it - unless, of course,you agree with Kenneth Grant (2002, p xxix): It sometimes happensthat non-Initiates are used by the Outer Ones as vehicles for therevelation of hidden knowledge in a manner inexplicable to those sochosen, which they cannot explain to themselves or others  Such asituation was exemplified in the case of H.P.Lovecrafts persistent refusalto admit of any value attaching to his tales other than of a purelyimaginative kind. It might also be pointed out that Lovecraft, the anti-Semite who married a Jew, was quite capable of maintaining a doublestandard. In the meantime, some further rebuttals can be offered, asfollows.One is that an author can have a literary interest in using esoteric materialwithout necessarily being a believer or a practitioner. It is undeniablethat Lovecraft had such a literary interest, if nothing else, as displayedin The Call of Cthulhu, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, and SupernaturalHorror in Literature, to mention only a few. Part of the growing academic"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"204 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3interest in the occult has been an increasing recognition of the numberof modern authors who have used the esoteric as a source of inspirationand imagery - perhaps for the very reason that they do not believe in it,but can use it freely and imaginatively. In this literary context, Lovecraftsapparent knowledge of the occult would not have been not unusual:parallels may be found with Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood,who had been members of the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn, andwhom Lovecraft regarded as his masters in the art of weird fiction.Another influence with an interest in the occult was Sax Rohmer, whoseRomance of Sorcery (1914) may have been a source on the history ofmagic for Lovecraft, while Batwing (1921) could have influenced TheCall of Cthulhu.Such authors need not be practising occultists, however; the esoterichas been mentioned (by Materer, 1995) in connection with T.S.Eliot,Ezra Pound, H.D., Robert Duncan, Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, and JamesMerrill, among modernist poets. Modern novelists include John CowperPowys (see Krissdottir, 1980); Malcom Lowry (see Epstein, 1969); Zola,Verne, Breton, Proust, Mann, Hesse, Joyce, Meyrink, Lindsay Clarke,Yourcenar, Eco and Butor (see Meakin, 1995).One might also conjecture that Lovecraft, having used this material inThe Dream-Quest, abandoned it as too constrictive, and thereafterdeveloped his own mythos in his fiction. A parallel might be drawn inthis case with W.B.Yeats, a former member of the Golden Dawn, wholikewise developed his own mythos, published as A Vision in 1925.Communicated via his wifes automatic writing, the sources said, Wehave come to give you metaphors for poetry, which Yeats usedthenceforth. And, of course, a parallel to that is the channelling of The"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 205Book of the Law to Crowley in 1904, following his wifes priorcommunication. (Did Mrs Lovecraft have a hand in The Dream-Quest?Perhaps it is not impossible that Sonia knew something of the Cabalaor the Tarot). Interestingly, Crowley had, like Yeats, given up on GoldenDawn style magic before receiving The Book of the Law: All that he hadattained, he abandoned. The intuitions of the Qabalah were cast behindhim with a smile at his youthful folly; magic, if true, led nowhere(Crowley, 1936). One might tentatively draw a parallel with Lovecraft:if our hypothesis is right, he too might have said his farewell to theGolden Dawn style of magical symbolism in The Dream-Quest, andthereafter developed his own mythos in his fiction, as did Yeats in hispoetry and Crowley in his magick. In that sense, if no other, KennethGrant (1972, p 114-7) would have been right to draw attention to theparallels between Crowley and Lovecraft.(As noted above, Joshis chronology (1980, p 37) argues against a water-tight distinction between the Dreamlands and the Mythos fictions;nevertheless, one clearly follows the other).Lovecrafts letters shed some light on his attitude: for example, onOctober 9, 1925, Lovecraft had written to Clark Aston Smith askingfor help, as he was appallingly ignorant, in finding sources of materialon magic. But this can be taken two ways: at that date, he was ignorant- but he was also interested. (Smiths reply no longer exists, but perhapshe came up trumps, as it were, by sending some unusual material thatwas later returned or lost - but this must remain mere conjecture). Wehave to bear in mind, however, that Lovecrafts publishedcorrespondence is only a small proportion of the total, and the SelectedLetters were often abridged by August Derleth - some might say censored"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"206 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3(Gonce, 2003, p 85). Moreover, they lack many of Lovecraftsaccompanying illustrations: Derleth himself, in his introduction to thefirst volume of the Selected Letters (1965, p xxii) states how sometimeshe drew signs of cabalistic ritual or magic. Needless to say, however,we cannot rely on the notional support of unpublished and perhapsnon-existent letters by Lovecraft; but it is to be hoped that furtherresearch among any remaining unpublished papers may shed furtherlight on this matter.If we accept that Lovecraft had some knowledge of the esoteric, thequestion remains as to the source. Lovecraft is often said to have derivedhis esoteric knowledge from one book in particular, Lewis SpencesEncyclopaedia of Occultism (1920), which he owned. While Lovecraft wasno doubt familiar with this work, a glance reveals it could not havesupplied him with all the details mentioned above. While this knowledgecan easily be gained today by a visit to almost any large bookshop, thiswas not so in the 1920s. Lovecraft could have learned some of it fromonly a few published sources, such as rare privately printed books, orthe journal or correspondence course of an occult society. Lovecraft,however, read widely and omnivorously from his childhood onwards,with a great interest in many subjects, one of which the occult became;as a result it is difficult to be certain how much he read in a subject, andhow much he knew. Lovecraft certainly improved his knowledge withtime; in the 1930s he had several books on the occult in his library, andwas able to advise fellow writers. (Gonce, 2003, p 12-15)Hulse (1994, p 272, 280-1, 352-6) outlines the development of theTree and the Tarot Paths as a combined symbolic structure. In 1856Eliphas Levi made the first connection between the Cabalah and the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 207Tarot, followed by Papus in 1889. In Britain, S.L.MacGregor Mathersdeveloped it in his Book T for the Order of the Golden Dawn in 1887.The attribution of the Tarot trumps to the Paths of the Tree was givento members in the Fourth Knowledge Lecture, as may be seen in Regardie(1986, p 71). The details of this were released by Aleister Crowley inhis Liber 777 in 1909, and his periodical The Equinox (1909-14), bothprivately printed. One V.N. (Victor Neuberg?) published the GoldenDawn system in The Occult Review of May 1910. In the same yearA.E.Waites The Pictorial Key to the Tarot (1910) described the Tarot, whilehis The Holy Kabbalah (1924, incorporating earlier works) described theTree, and some of the Qliphoth, but neither mapped the Tarot onto theTree. Waite also wrote on the relationship between the Cabalah, theHebrew alphabet and the Tarot in his introduction to Knut Stenringstranslation of the Sepher Yetzirah in 1923. In the United States, Harrietteand Homer Curtiss revealed much symbology of the Tarot in relationto numbers, the Cabalah, the Hebrew alphabet, etc., in their The Key tothe Universe (1919) and The Key of Destiny (1923).It is therefore possible that Lovecraft may have seen something stemmingfrom the British Golden Dawn tradition, or a parallel American one,which he was able to use in The Dream-Quest. This is assuming, of course,that the premise is granted that there is, within this text, more thanmeets the eye at first sight; and that the eye of the beholder is not toobiased."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"208 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" Issue 3 - Journal for the Academic Study of Magic 209Notes on the illustration(s)The blank chart of the Tree of Life, on which I have drawn my map, issupplied by the Sorcerers Apprentice, 6-8 Burley Road, Leeds LS6 1QP, towhom are due many thanks for permission to reproduce it.The illustrations of the Tarot cards are from the original 1910 line drawingsthat appeared in The Pictorial Key to the Tarot by Arthur Edward Waite, whichis in the public domain.ReferencesBarry , Kieren, 1999, The Greek Qabalah, Weiser, York Beach Maine.Bias, Clifford , 1997, Qabalah, Tarot and the Western Mystery Tradition, Weiser,York Beach Maine Burleson, D., 1983, H.P.Lovecraft: A Critical Study,Greenwood Press, Westport Conn.Case, Paul Foster, 1947, The Tarot, Macoy, New YorkClute, John and John Grant, eds., 1997, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, London,OrbitCrowley, Aleister, 1912, 777 and other Qabalistic Writings, reprinted 1998 byWeiser, York Beach MaineCrowley, Aleister, 1936, The Equinox of the Gods, LondonCurtiss, Harriette and Homer, 1919, The Key to the Universe and 1923, The Keyof Destiny, reprinted 1983 by Newcastle, Hollywood CaliforniaDerleth, August, 1968, H.P.Lovecrafts Novels in At the Mountains of Madnessand other novels of terror, Panther, LondonDenning, M. and O.Phillips, 1988, The Sword and the Serpent, Llewellyn,St.PaulEpstein, Pearl, 1969, The Private Labyrinth of Malcom Lowry: Under the Volcanoand the Cabbala, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, New YorkGodwin, David, 1979, Cabalistic Encyclopedia, Llewellyn, St.PaulGonce, John and Daniel Harms, 2003, The Necronomicon Files, Weiser, YorkBeach MaineGrant, Kenneth, 1972, The Magical Revival, Muller, London, and throughouthis later Typhonian Trilogies until The Ninth Arch, Starfire, London, 2002"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"210 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 3Hulse, David, 1994, The Key of It All, Book Two:The Western Mysteries,Llewellyn, St. PaulS.T.
