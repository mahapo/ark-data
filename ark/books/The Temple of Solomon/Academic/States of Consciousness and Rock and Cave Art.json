Ever since I learned aboutcave art in an introductory archaeology class, I've been a nut on the subject. Myfantasy/dream was fulfilled in the summer of 1995, when I went on a tour of thePaleolithic painted caves in France. My time in Lascaux (the original, not thereproduction) was easily the most profoundly moving experience of my life.Rock art has not obsessed me in the same way, but it is something that I havebeen drawn to in my brief travels. While at UC Santa Barbara, I took a course in artof North American Indians. I hated the course—it was taught in the art department,and generally ignored the anthropological issues that interested me. However, thatwas where I first encountered the Anasazi figure, Kokopelli. I spent most of my timein class, doodling various versions of Kokopelli, in all sorts of modern-day activities(e.g., Kokopelli goes bowling).The most intriguing questions to me are the ones that have to do with themeaning and significance of cave/rock art. Why did people draw on cave walls androck faces? What do the images mean.7 There have been many interpretations (andof course, no single interpretation can explain the various drawings made over timeat even one site, let alone hundreds of different ones around the world) ranging fromart for art's sake to hunting magic to territorial markings to visual history. It was notuntil fairly recently that I came across suggestions that some cave and rock art mayin fact be related to depictions of altered states of consciousness. I thought that wouldbe an interesting subject to explore in an issue of Anthropology of Consciousness.Once I had decided on the theme for the issue, I thought putting it togetherwould be a rather easy task. I had no idea that I would he placing myself in the midstof an academic hurricane.At the center of the hurricane is David Lewis-Williams, who, along withThomas Dowson, wrote a seminal and highly controversial article, published inCurrent Anthropology in 1988. In it, they present a neuropsychological model ofupper Paleolithic cave art. Although I am an outsider to the field of rock art, I gotthe distinct impression that most people in the field either hate his work, or thinkhe is a genius. I contacted many of the major researchers in the field, and when I toldthem the theme of the issue, they were either delighted to share their research, orwanted to write an article criticizing the work of Lewis-Williams.1 was not interested in having the issue be a forum on Lewis-Williams.

As I described in my letter topotential authors, I wanted to focus on the relationship between rock/cave art andconsciousness in terms of its use in shamanistic traditions, the way it representstrance states or psychedelic drug states, or anything else having to do with states ofconsciousness.I \"lost\" a number of authors due to my unwillingness to make the controversy thefocus of the issue. • What I have instead are four papers which fit the theme, as I sawit. One is co-authored by Lewis-Williams; the others draw upon his work, for theneuropsychological model is the key to understanding the relationship betweencave/rock art and altered states of consciousness. I have tried to edit the papers insuch a way that they present the facts and interpretations, and leave it up to thereader to decide whether or not they make sense. I felt compelled, however, to sharesome of the history of this issue, so that the naive reader (and I am assuming that mostof the readers of AOC are naive to the controversies within the field of rock art) willat least be aware that this is the stuff of great controversy and high passion.The issue begins with the paper, \"On Neuropsychology in Southern AfricanRock Art Research\" by Geoffrey Blundell, a colleague of David Lewis-Williams atthe Rock Art Research Center in Johannesburg, South Africa. He presents theneuropsychological model, and applies it to San (Bushman) rock art research. Heemphasizes the use of this model in conjunction with ethnographically-basedinterpretations of the art.Next is the article, \"The Mind in the Cave — the Cave in the Mind: AlteredConsciousness in the Upper Paleolithic,\" co-authored by Lewis-Williams and JeanClottes, the Scientific Advisor on Prehistoric Art to the French Ministry of Culture.They argue that at least some of the Upper Paleolithic cave art (of which I am soenamored) was intimately associated with a variety of shamanic practices. Theyposit that the underground location of the caves, as experienced in altered states ofconsciousness, helped to create notions of a subterranean spirit-world which thenbecame sites for vision quests. My own experience of being in the caves after havingstudied their art in books for decades, has lead me to believe that the caves themselvesare an essential and integral part of the viewing experience — in a way I never couldhave imagined before being there.The next article continues upon the foundation of the first two, in that itintegrates both cognitive neuroscience and shamanism in an examination of therock art of California. The article, aptly entitled, \"Cognitive Neuroscience,Shamanism and the Rock Art of Native California\" is written by David Whitley. Heargues that an important function of California rock art is to record the memory ofwhat occurs during shamanic states of consciousness.The final paper, by Carol Patterson, also focuses on California rock art, but ata single site. In her article, entitled, \"Seeking Power at Willow Creek Cave,Northern California\" Patterson suggests that the caves have been used continuouslyfor the last 2,000 years for vision quests and seeking power. Her interviews withpracticing shamans who have experienced the entoptic phenomena support Lewis-Williams and Dowson's theories about the universality of the images and their rolein enhancing the acquisition of power through altered states of consciousness.As you read these articles, keep in mind that they are only one point of view, butan intriguing one, nonetheless."}]
