Absender soll ein gewisses ‘Fräulein Sprengel’ gewesen sein, eine angeblichedeutsche Rosenkreuzermeisterin mit dem magischen PseudonymSapiens DominabiturAstris. Diese Briefe enthielten den Auftrag zur Gründung des Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn. In der Erforschung der Ursprünge des Golden Dawn werden diese Briefe generellals Fälschungen betrachtet. Man geht davon aus, dass der Text von Westcott mit dem Zieleiner Autoritätsanmaßung selbst entworfen wurde und anschließend ins Deutsche übertra-gen wurde. Der Autor des vorliegenden Artikels hat die im Freimaurermuseum in Londonaufbewahrten Originalbriefe überprüft und darin Anhaltspunkte gefunden, die die IdentitätvonSapiens Dominabitur Astrisin neuem und überraschendem Licht erscheinen lassen.KeywordsGolden Dawn; Wynn Westcott; Fräulein Sprengel;Sapiens Dominabitur AstrisOf all the mysteries connected with the origins of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, none is more teasing than the riddle of the so-called ‘FräuleinSprengel letters’. For readers less familiar with the Golden Dawn’s inceptionsit may be helpful to recapitulate the basic facts as we know them. The storygoes that in  Dr. William Wynn Westcott (–), a London coro-ner and Freemason with strong esoteric leanings, came into possession of amanuscript, written in a cipher based on thePolygraphiae libri sex() ofthe Benedictine Abbot Johannes Trithemius (–). When deciphered,the manuscript was found to contain skeleton descriptions of rituals, written inEnglish, apparently stemming from an order with a grade structure similar tothe Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and the German th-century Gold- und"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Christopher McIntosh / ARIES . () –Rosenkreuzer (Golden and Rosy Cross) order. The manuscript also containedelements of esoteric lore including references from the Kabbalah, astrology,alchemy and the Tarot. Much has been written about this cipher manuscript,and there are still many unanswered questions surrounding it, but I shall notdwell on the manuscript, except to add that between its pages was a slip ofpaper, with a short message, also in cipher but in a different hand from themain manuscript. As Ellic Howe reports, this message, when translated, read:‘Sapiens dom ast is a chief among the members of the goldene dammerung[i.e., Golden Dawn] she is a famous soror her name is fräulein sprengel let-ters reach her at herr j enger hotel marquardt stuttgart she is  =  [figures inHebrew characters] or a chief adept’.1The abbreviated motto isSapiens Dom-inabitur Astris, meaning ‘the wise person will rule the stars’. In later referencesshe is referred to as ‘A. Sprengel’ or ‘Anna Sprengel’.2Howe then goes on to say: ‘Soror SDA provided an ideal solution to West-cott’s problem. By locating her in Germany he made her inaccessible, and byinvesting herwith an exaltedrank in a suitablymysterious German occult orderhe made her a credible source of authority.’3The Hotel Marquardt existed, asis proved by a lunch bill on headed paper, dated  December , which ispreserved among the ‘Sprengel letters’ in the Library and Museum of Freema-sonry in London.4The letters were, according to the first one, written forSapi-ens Dominabitur Astrisby her secretary, who called himself Frater ‘In UtroqueFidelis’ (faithful in both). Westcott, as he claimed, wrote to S.D.A. at thisaccommodation address, and there ensued an exchange of letters, using thetranslation services of a certain Albert Essinger, evidently a German living inLondon. Howe’s account, however, is rather different:1)Howe,Magicians of the Golden Dawn, .2)With regard to the name Sprengel, see Henrik Bogdan, ‘Women and the Hermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn: Nineteenth Century Occultist Initiation from a Gender Perspective’,. Here it is explained that in the German masonic context the term ‘Sprengel-Recht’,refers to ‘the area where a Grand Lodge is allowed to found lodges’. See also Marcel Rogge-mans,Geschiedenis van de occulte en mystieke broederschappen, : ‘Een andere hypothesezegt dat Fräulein Sprengel een “codeword” zou kunnen zijn van het Duitse woord “spren-gelrecht”. Dit betekent “territoriale jurisdictie”.’3)Howe,Magicians of the Golden Dawn, .4)The Collection, kept in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry,  Great Queen Street,London WCE AZ, is labelled “The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and RelatedBodies”. The material referred to here is in Sub fonds , Series /, “Sprengel Letters:originals, translations and related material”."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Christopher McIntosh / ARIES . () –In order to play the Soror S.D.A. “game” properly it was necessary for Westcott toappear to write to her and for a potential witness to know about the correspondence.However, Westcott’s letters, duly translated by Mr Essinger, would never have beenposted ...Westcott next drafted Soror S.D.A.’s replies in English. An unidentified person—graphological evidence suggests it was not Mr Essinger—then made painfully literaltranslations into what he supposed was German. As and when Soror S.D.A.’s letters“arrived”, Westcott gave them to Mr Essinger for translation back into English.5Howe adds that the letters from S.D.A. are so full of linguistic errors andanglicisms that they could not have been written by a German.For over a century these letters have been the object of debate. Were theygenuine or a forgery? Did Fräulein Sprengel exist or was she invented byWestcott? While Howe and the equally well-known historian of the GoldenDawn,R.A.Gilbert,6have little doubt that the correspondence was forged byWestcott, apologists for the Golden Dawn are inclined to give Westcott thebenefit of the doubt.I might have been content to let sleeping dogs lie, had I not had occasionto revisit Ellic Howe’s bookThe Magicians of the Golden Dawn, which containsa photograph of the first ‘Sprengel’ letter as well as the English translationthat Howe claims was probably in fact Westcott’s original draft for the bogusGerman letter.The letter reproduced by Howe is, like all the others, written in GermanGothic handwriting, which was the normal script used in Germany up toabout the Second World War. This is a difficult script for a foreigner to read letalone write. And this handwriting is fluent and confident, suggesting that thewriter—or at least the amanuensis—was either (a) a native German speaker or(b) a non-German who had lived in Germany for some years. It is true thatthe letter contains some striking grammatical mistakes, which would tend toargue for (b)—I shall return to this question later.The German text begins:Lieber Bruder Sapere AudeIch habe schon längere Zeit die Wohnung verlassen, wohin Sie meinen Brief sandtenaber ich erhielt endlich nach längerer Zeit Ihren Brief. Ich war sehr erfreut die Mit-theilung zu erhalten, daß die geheimen Papiere welche Sie beschreiben sind wieder5)Howe,Magicians of the Golden Dawn, .6)See Gilbert,The Golden Dawn, ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Christopher McIntosh / ARIES . () –einmalzumVorscheingekommen.DieselbenwurdendurchdenliebenAbbéCon-stant vor Jahren verloren & kamen dann in den Händen von zwei Engländer, welcheum die Erlaubniß einkamen dieselben zu benutzen.7And the English translation made for Westcott reads:Dear Brother,I have long left the address to which you sent a letter but it has safely reached me atlast. I am very glad to hear that the private papers which you describe have been foundonce more, they were lost by poor Abbé Constant years ago and then came into thehands of two Englishmen who applied for leave to use them.8Comparing the German letter with the English translation, I was struck by thefact that the latter contained a number of mistakes, indicating that the text hadbeen translated—rather badly—from German into English and not vice versa.There are certain words in it that give the game away. One is the wordgeheim,which normally means ‘secret’ although in some contexts it can mean ‘private’.In the context of an occult order it would almost certainly be intended to mean‘secret’, but here it has been translated as ‘private’. Then again, Abbé Constant(alias Eliphas Lévi) is referred to in the German asden lieben Abbé Constant(thedear AbbéConstant),whereasthetranslatorhas written“poor AbbéConstant”.These mistakes could have been due to an imperfect knowledge of German orlack of familiarity with the script. At any rate, it is clear that Howe was wrongto suppose that Westcott had written the English text and had it translated intoGerman to masquerade as a letter from S.D.A. It is true that Westcott couldhave made an earlier draft or perhaps dictated the letter, but then he wouldhave ended up with a translation different from his draft.These findings ledme to wonder whetherHowe had beenmistaken on otherpoints as well, so I decided to go to the Library and Museum of Freemasonryin London and consult the original letters in the Golden Dawn Collection.Instinct told me that I would find something important there, but I wasunprepared for what would prove to be a staggering discovery.In order to make clear what I found out, it will be necessary to explainsomething about German for those readers unfamiliar with the language.Whereas in English a letter can easily be written giving no indication of the sexof the writer other than his or her first name, in German the sex immediately7)Howe,Magicians of the Golden Dawn, Plate III.8)Ibid., ."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Christopher McIntosh / ARIES . () –becomes apparent when the correspondent uses an adjective to refer to himselfor herself.This is becausethe ending of an adjective has to agree with thegenderof the noun it qualifies.Now when I came to the second letter from S.D.A.,9I was astonished tosee that the writer signed off as ‘Ihr ganz ergebener’ (your devoted), the pointbeing that both the possessive pronoun ‘Ihr’ and the adjective ‘ergebener’weremasculine. At first I thought this might, by a long stretch of the imagination,be a slip on the part of the amanuensis, but when I read on through theletters I found that whenever an adjective or possessive pronoun was usedto refer to the writer the ending was always masculine. Then came the finalletter, written in August  by a different correspondent with the motto‘Ex Uno Disce Omnes’ (From One Learn All), in which the death of S.D.A.was reported (again in incorrect German) as follows: ‘Es ist mir sehr leid, daßich Euch anzeigen mus den Sterbefall unseres gelehrten Freundes S.D.A.’ (I amsorry to inform you of the death of our learned friend S.D.A). Here againthe genitive ending ofunseres(of our learned) is masculine, as is the nounFreundes. So now there was no shadow of doubt: S.D.A.—whether real orinvented—was aman! Fräulein Sprengel either never existed or was someoneelse entirely.As soon as I had made this astonishing discovery, other questions begancrowding into my mind. First of all, why had this escaped notice up to now?Admittedly the papers had for many decades been held in a private collectionbefore being deposited at Freemasons’ Hall, but Ellic Howe for one had beenable to gain access to them. Why had he, with his knowledge of German, notspotted what I had spotted? Perhaps he was not as familiar with the scriptas he was with German typography, in which he was known as an expert,or perhaps he simply did not read the letters carefully enough. But what ofOskar Schlag, the Zürich graphologist to whom Ellic Howe showed the letters?Schlag immediately spotted the many linguistic errors in the letters but not theobvious matter of the writer’s gender, perhaps because it was simply not whathe was looking for. Since then it appears that no one with a knowledge ofGerman, and able to read the script, had looked at the letters before me. Or, ifthey had, they had not noticed what I had.More important, however, are the questions of substance which the discov-ery raises. If S.D.A. was a man, why did Westcott think or pretend that hewas corresponding with a woman? How did the confusion come about? Was9)Golden Dawn Collection, Series /. All letters quoted are from the same series."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Christopher McIntosh / ARIES . () –S.D.A. a real person or not? If he existed, who might he have been? And whatare the implications for the question of fraud or not fraud?I would like to attempt two scenarios—one assuming that the letters werea forgery, the other assuming that S.D.A. really existed.In the first scenario we have to account for the fact that Westcott presentedS.D.A. as a woman, while the letters clearly showed the correspondent as aman. This scenario presupposes that Westcott used two translators—Essingerand one other—otherwise there would only have been one English version ofeach S.D.A. letter, namely Westcott’s draft (and, as I have shown, the finaltranslation must have differed from the draft). Ellic Howe also suspected twotranslators on the basis of graphological evidence. This would make sense ifWestcott was using Essinger for appearance’s sake, to show that the letters hadindeed been translated from the German. So the scenario is this: Westcottwrites a pretend letter to S.D.A. and drafts a pretend reply, which he givesto someone he knows in England who has some (but imperfect) knowledgeof German and can write Gothic script. Let us call this person ‘Translator X’.Westcott omits to tell Translator X that the correspondent is supposed to bewoman, and X assumes that S.D.A. is male and writes the letters accordingly.The German text of each letter is then given to Essinger, who simply translatesthem into English, not commenting on the gender—perhaps he also does notknow that Westcott’s correspondent is supposed to be female. As the Englishtranslation does not indicate the gender, Westcott never finds out about thediscrepancy. And so the misunderstanding continues right through the finalletter announcing S.D.A.’s death.The second scenario is as follows: Starting with the slip of paper found withtheciphermanuscript,giving information aboutS.D.A.,letussuppose that thewriter of this note has mistakenly conflated two different people: S.D.A. andFräulein Sprengel. Westcott then duly writes care of Herr Enger at the HotelMarquardt in Stuttgart, enclosing a letter to S.D.A. and using the motto ratherthanthenameFräuleinSprengel.Induecoursehereceivesthefirstreply.Hehas it translated by Essinger and reports with delight to his friends MacGregorMathers, W.R. Woodman and possibly others involved in the founding of theGolden Dawn, that he has been contacted by the great German Rosicrucianadept Fräulein Sprengel. Westcott then writes again to S.D.A. and receives asecond reply. At this point, or conceivably a little later in the correspondence,Essinger spots the gender of the writer and tells Westcott. Now Westcott is in adilemma. He cannot reveal the discovery without making a fool of himself. Onthe other hand, he cannot abandon the correspondence because S.D.A. is nowvital to his plans for the Golden Dawn. So he continues the correspondence,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Christopher McIntosh / ARIES . () –swearing Essinger to secrecy and pretending to the others that he is dealingwithSororS.D.A., alias Fräulein Sprengel, and notFraterS.D.A. This wouldexplain why he remained silent and refused to produce contrary evidence whenMathers later accused him of forging the correspondence.Which of these two scenarios is the most probable? What speaks in favourof the letters being fraudulent is that they so closely fit the stereotype ofthe fictitious lineage that esoteric groups so often construct in order to givethemselves legitimacy. Another thing that makes them suspect is the way inwhich they conveniently arrived at the moment when the Golden Dawn wasbeing planned, and equally conveniently nominated Westcott, Mathers andWoodman as the three chiefs. And there is S.D.A.’s timely death in  whenshe/he was no longer needed. Furthermore, it is suspicious that the letters weresupposedly not entrustedto the post, as indicated in the first letterfrom S.D.A.This looks like a device to account for the absence of postmarked envelopesfrom Germany. There is also the faulty German in which they are written,although if S.D.A was not Fräulein Sprengel, as I have shown, then there isnothing to say that he was a native German, only someone who appeared tobe living in Germany.Against the forgery theory one could argue that a forger would surely havegone to the trouble of procuring an impeccably correct German text. A forgerwould also surely have made the letters look as impressive as possible, withan imposing letter head, copperplate writing and possibly a wax seal. Insteadthe letters are on small sheets of paper and rather untidily written in an oftenspidery hand.What sort of person might the writer of the German letters have been(whether Translator X or S.D.A.?) Although he uses some idiomatic Germanexpressions, he makes many spelling and grammatical mistakes and he scattershis letters with anglicisms (‘Secretary’ instead theSekretär,‘Lodge’insteadofLoge, etc.) and the occasional French term (Couvertfor ‘sealed letter’and in oneplaceSecretairefor secretary). Such a person could have been an Englishmanwho had spent time in Germany or a person of Anglo-German backgroundwhose German was imperfect.Alternatively,he might have beensomeone fromone of the territories of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, such as Hungary orBohemia, where German was common currency in addition to the nationallanguage. One possible candidate, who has been suggested to me by Dr.R.A. Gilbert, is Julius Kohn, apparently a Jewish immigrant and author onalchemicalsubjects,whowas in contactwith someof theGolden Dawn figures.In the collection of letters of the Golden Dawn member W.A. Ayton, editedby Ellic Howe, there are a number of references to Kohn. For example, on"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Christopher McIntosh / ARIES . () – April  Ayton wrote to his fellow Golden Dawn member F.L. Gardner:‘I have told you I have a Jewish learned friend who was very advanced tho’he never would belong to any order or society.’10Ellic Howe comments asfollows:It has not been possible to discover anything about Kohn’s life, but in the Introductionto his translation ofThe Prophecies of Paracelsus: Magic Figures and Prognostications(), he mentioned that his ‘studies in the Occult ... have now extended over fortyyears’, which suggests that he was born c.  ... In his ‘Hermetic’ catalogue No. (Summer )Mr Gilbert [i.e.,R.A. Gilbert] described Kohn as an Austrian emigré.11Of course Kohn is only one possible candidate, and pending further evidencethe identity of Translator X must remain a mystery.As I see it, there are now four main explanations for the correspondence:(a) S.D.A. was a fiction created by Westcott, and the gender discrepancy cameabout in the manner I have outlined in the first scenario.(b) He was a fiction created by someone other than Westcott.(c) He was an impostor posing as a Rosicrucian adept.(d) He was what he claimed to be: a member of a German esoteric lodge,willing to confer authority on Westcott, Mathers and Woodman to foundan English offshoot.While I would argue that the weight of the evidence points to (a)—i.e. the oldforgery theory with a new twist—one cannot be sure. However, one thing wecan say with certainty is that S.D.A. was not Fräulein Sprengel. So we can bidfarewell toSororS.D.A. Vale Soror!
