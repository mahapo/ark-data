It would be far from me to claim that all currents andphenomena that are nowadays gathered under the umbrella of “Western esotericism” were alwaysperceived as problematic; in fact, the opposite is true, and an important task for the study ofWestern esotericism is to point out that many of its basic ideas and currents used to be part of normal acceptable discourse and of general Western culture, and came to be regarded asFORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE: ANTI-ESOTERIC POLEMICS AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHWOUTERJ.

What is it that justifies gathering suchan enormous amount of often spectacularly different currents and personal-ities, from late antiquity to the present, under one and the same termino-logical rubric? The question has occupied me ever since I first began to beinterested in the field3, but by the time I had to write the Introduction to theBrill Dictionary, I was surprised at how easy I found it to answer. Havingbriefly discussed the most important terms and categories that have tradi-tionally been used by scholars to speak about the field, I concluded that . . .seemingly innocuous terminological conventions are often the reflection ofhidden or implicit ideological agendas. Perhaps no other domain in the study ofreligion has suffered from such biases as seriously as the one to which thisDictionary is devoted, for it covers more or less all currents and phenomenathat have, at one time or another4, come to be perceived as problematic (mis-ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 225"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"226WOUTER J.

An important pioneer in the academic study of Westernesotericism, Webb was also a child of his time, and his discussion of the occult as represent-ing “the flight from reason” (o.c., ch. 1) still strongly reflects the polemical discourse which Icriticize in this paper. 7It is basic to my argument that the generic “we” includes ourselves as contemporary schol-ars of Western esotericism: assuming that it is only “them” who tell those stories means miss-ing the point altogether.guided, heretical, irrational, dangerous, evil, or simply ridiculous) from the per-spectives of established religion, philosophy, science, and academic research5.This simple conclusion—reminiscent, in a way, of James Webb’s concept of“rejected knowledge”6—provides the starting-point for the present article. Inbrief, I will argue that the field of study referred to as “Western esotericism”is the historical product of a polemical discourse, the dynamics of which canbe traced all the way back to the beginnings of monotheism. Moreover, it isin the terms of this very same discourse that mainstream Western culture hasbeen construing its own identity, up to the present day. This process of theconstruction of identity takes place by means of telling stories—to ourselvesand to others—of who, what and how we want to be7. The challenge of the modern study of Western esotericism to academic research ultimatelyconsists in the fact that it questions and undermines those stories, and forcesus to see who, what and how we really are. Instinctive resistance against the breaking down of certainties implicit in such (self )knowledge is at thevery root of traditional academic resistance against the study of Western esotericism.1.Polemics and Procedures of ExclusionAny polemical discourse, I suggest, is subject to a number of basic conditions:1 .It requires a sense of unrest or threat (in situations of total contentment andsecurity—real or imaginary—there is no motivation for engaging in polem-ical discourse).2 .It requires that the source of threat be not entirely clear and readily accessi-ble (if the enemy is standing on your doorstep threatening to kill you, youdo not polemicize against him but seek to attack or defend yourself).3 .It requires a target (if, in contrast to the previous point, there is no enemy—real or imagined—that can be attacked, polemical discourse dies stillborn,from pure frustration).ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 226"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE2278For Bush’s rhetoric, see the excellent (and very disturbing) article by Urban, ‘Religion andSecrecy in the Bush Administration’; on page 6 Urban quotes a speech before the FBI onSeptember 25, 2001: ‘I see things this way: The people who did this act on America . . . areevil people. They don’t represent an ideology, they don’t represent a legitimate political groupof people. They’re flat evil. That’s all they can think about, is evil. And as a nation of goodfolks, we’re going to hunt them down, and we’re going to find them, and we will bring themto justice’ (Urban o.c., quoting from Bush, “We Will Prevail”, 22).4 .It requires an audience (if nobody is interested in your polemics, the dis-course never develops beyond the stage of mere monologue).5. It requires simplicity, i.e. the discourse must be based on simple oppositions(complex arguments, with plenty of room for nuance and qualifications, arepolemically ineffective).Politicians know these things instinctively, and my points can easily bedemonstrated at the example of the Bush administration’s rhetoric about inter-national terrorism. The climate that made it possible was created by the acutesense of threat (1) caused by the 9-11 attack. Although the source of thethreat was quickly identified as Al Qaida and Islamic terrorism generally,these faceless networks of groups and individuals were not readily availablefor retaliation (2). In order for a polemical discourse to develop against thisbackground, an attackable target was needed (3): hence the political rheto-ric came to focus first on the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, then on SaddamHussein’s regime in Iraq. Since the sense of threat was widely shared, thediscourse found a receptive audience (4). And finally, its effectiveness reliedon simple dualisms of unambiguous good versus unambiguous evil (5): “youare either with us or with the terrorists”, the “axis of evil” stands against“the land of the free”, the choice is between tyranny or democracy, and onemay even have to choose between French fries or Freedom fries8.To prevent misunderstanding: the fact that any polemical discourse needsto “create” a target enemy does not, of course, imply that this enemy is whollyimaginary and constitutes no real threat. It does mean, however, that—whether there is a real enemy or not—a polemical discourse needs to makeit look real at leastin the imagination. And in order for this to happen, eventhe most concrete enemy needs to be simplified: the reified “other” in anypolemical discourse is therefore always an artificial creature, juxtaposedagainst a no less artificial “self ”. By simplifying the “other” as unambigu-ously bad, polemicists simultaneously create a simplified identity for them-selves as unambiguously good. In order for a polemical discourse to beeffective, these two artificial entities and the clearcut opposition betweenthem must take the place, on the screen of the human imagination, of theARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 227"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"228WOUTER J. HANEGRAAFF9I realize that the implications are farreaching. If I claim that polemical discourse createsconfusion between imagination and reality, and argue (as I will do in the rest of the article) thatit is the task of scholarship to criticize such confusion and call attention to the complexity ofhistorical reality, some critics will object that this may be academically correct but politicallynaive and even dangerous, because it blurs the distinction between good and evil and ends updefending moral relativism. I maintain that the commitment of academic scholarship in theEnlightenment tradition is to the truth, by means of critical research and reflection (even thoughany such “truth” is always limited, conditional and provisory); obscuring the truth in the inter-est of “morality” is far more immoral than facing up to the fact that any moral commitment isindeed a commitment, not a logical inference from unquestionable metaphysical truths (cf. onthis point my discussion of relativism in ‘Prospects for the Globalization’).10As argued at length in my ‘On the Construction’. Confusion of this kind is demonstratedparticularly clearly by the multiple cases of authors who have used Antoine Faivre’s famousdefinition of Western esotericism (in terms of four intrinsic and two non-intrinsic variables) asa lithmus test for deciding whether person x or movement y “is” esoteric or not. See my dis-cussion of this problem in ‘The Study of Western Esotericism’, 508.11Foucault, L’ordre du discours, 11-23 (“l’interdit”, “l’opposition raison et folie”, “l’oppo-sition du vrai et du faux” [i.e. “la volonté de vérité”]).much more complex and messy realities “out there”. The effectiveness of thediscourse is proportional to the extent in which it succeeds in confusingitsparticipants, so that they mistake the categories of their imagination fordescriptions of reality9.Now, precisely such a reification of imaginary constructs by means ofpolemical discourse over many centuries, or so I will argue, is at the bottomof the modern and contemporary perception of “Western esotericism” as aseparate tradition or field of research rather than as merely a dimension ofWestern culture generally. This is not an argument for discarding any suchconcepts; but it is an argument for not confusing our constructs with histor-ical reality10.To understand the emergence of “Western esotericism” as a field of re-search, we need to look not only at the dynamics of polemical discourse, butalso at the various procedures of exclusion that function within such a dis-course. Michel Foucault has famously distinguished between three such pro-cedures: prohibitions, the opposition of reason against madness, and theopposition of true against false11. I intend to slightly complicate this list bydistinguishing between twokinds of prohibition; and it seems to me thatFoucault ignored the difference between reasons forexclusion and strate-giesofexclusion. Thus I end up with four kinds of objection against the“others” in polemical discourses, and two kinds of strategy:ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 228"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE22912“Drugs” is a nice example of an “artificial enemy” created in the collective imaginationby means of simplification. For example, in the Netherlands the “party drug” XTC is consid-ered an illegal hard drug, wereas alcohol use is accepted. The facts are that alcohol is physi-cally addictive and its misuse frequently causes serious violent behaviour, whereas XTC is notphysically addictive and makes its users feel soft and loving instead of aggressive. While toomuch XTC can be dangerous to one’s health, the same goes for too much alcohol. Includingunder illegal “hard drugs” a substance like XTC but not alcohol is therefore highly artificial,and difficult to defend rationally. The simplified entity “drugs” as it functions in popular dis-course in fact refers to a multifarious collection of psychoactive substances that differ greatlyin their effects, their health hazards, and in being addictive or not; as a result, addictive anddangerous substances such as e.g. heroin are incorrectly lumped together with e.g. various non-addictive herbal brews containing dimethyltryptamine (Ayahuasca, Jurema etc.), which presentno danger to health and whose psychoactive properties can even have demonstrable healingeffects. 13This is demonstrated with particular clarity in the classic study of pornography by WalterKendrick, The Secret Museum. Likewise, Bette Talvacchia in her splendid study of Renaissanceeroticism formulates very precisely how and why pornography is an artificial polemical con-struct: ‘the creation of pornography . . . comes from targeting particular objects, images, andtexts as offensive to morality and therefore unacceptable, so that a pornographic object cannotexist without the discourse that identifies it. In this view, there is never any inherently porno-graphic nature in any cultural production; rather, certain kinds of sexual representations are sin-gled out and argued to be pornographic’ (Taking Positions, 103; mutatis mutandis—i.e. byreplacing the term “pornography/pornographic” by “esotericism/esoteric” and “sexual” by “reli-gious”—exactly the same argumentation can easily be applied to the category of Western eso-tericism). As is well-known, pornography was singled out as a target of polemics by feministactivists, with Andrea Dworkin as perhaps the most notorious example; their militant pro-censorship arguments have been countered by anti-censorship feminists such as notably LindaWilliams (for this distinction, see her Hard Core, 16-30). reason for exclusion:positive alternative:preferred strategy:danger– safetyprohibitionimmorality– moralityprohibitionirrationality– reasonridiculeerror– truthridiculeLet me take some examples. Harddrugs are prohibited because they are con-sidered dangerous, but not because they induce immoral behaviour; andpolemical discourse concerned with “the war on drugs” addresses a sense ofthreat to public safety by reducing a complex compound with fuzzy bound-aries to a simple generic concept12. Attempts to restrict or prohibit pornog-raphy, in contrast, are typically defended with moral arguments (its “dangers”being presented as dangers to morality); and here, again, the category ishighly artificial13. Such attempts at prohibition make no reference to reasonor truth. Western esotericism or its associated components (e.g. “magic”,“astrology”, “the occult”, etcetera), in contrast, tend to be a frequent focusof mild ridicule by contemporary academics; they are not considered immoralARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 229"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"230WOUTER J.

Onedoes not take such things seriously; for if one does, one risks finding one-self excluded from acceptable discourse14. At first sight an attitude of ridiculemay hardly seem to qualify as a “polemical” strategy, but I will argue that,on the contrary, its historical roots as far as Western esotericism is concernedare polemical in the extreme. It is only because the “other” in question is nolonger believed to pose a serious threat today, that prohibition and persecu-tion have been replaced by the milder—but not necessarily less effective—strategy of ridicule.2.The Grand Polemical NarrativeI hardly need to emphasize that an analysis within the space of a few pagesof a polemical discourse that (as I announced above) ‘can be traced all theway back to the beginnings of monotheism’ can only be sketchy in theextreme. Therefore the following overview is in no way intended as an empir-ically adequate description of historical reality, but merely intends to sketchthe outlines of a possible heuristic approach to it, in view of specific ques-tions that the study of Western esotericism cannot afford to ignore.The Construction of Paganism: Monotheism versus IdolatryIt is natural to assume that the polemical target of monotheistic discourseconsists in “polytheism”, but in fact that opposition is a relatively recent phe-nomenon. The term “polytheism” was introduced by Philo of Alexandria15,but came to be used by other authors only since Jean Bodin in 158016, andthe term “monotheism” was coined by Henry More in 1660 as a counter-term against polytheism. After Philo and up to the end of the 16th century,the basic opposition was another one: that of worship of the one true Godversus idolatry. The discourse that pits “monotheism” against “idolatry” goesback, of course, to the Hebrew Bible, which codifies it in the Second Com-mandment, and is of absolutely basic importance to how Jews, ChristiansARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 230"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE23117Halbertal & Margalit, Idolatry, 236.18Assmann, Moses the Egyptian, 1-2. Cf. Assmann, Die Mosaische Unterscheidung. 19Assmann, Moses the Egyptian, 4.and Muslims have construed their identities. As formulated by MosheHalbertal and Avishai Margalit, ‘The prohibition against idolatry is the thickwall that separates the non-pagans from pagans’17.As brilliantly argued by Jan Assmann, underneath this distinction is aneven more basic one. Western monotheism he describes as the space severedor cloven by the distinction between true and false in religion18. This dis-tinction, although first drawn by Akhenaten in the 14th century B.C., he refersto as the “Mosaic Distinction” because it has come to be linked to the nameof Moses in the actual mnemohistory of Western civilization. It created thenew phenomenon of what Assmann refers to as “counter-religion”: a type ofreligion that does not function as a means of intercultural translation (thegods of one pantheon being considered translatable into those of another)but as a means of intercultural estrangement, and which defines itself byrejecting and repudiating the gods of other and earlier peoples—in otherwords, by a polemical discourse:Narratively, the distinction is represented by the story of Israel’s Exodus out ofEgypt. Egypt thereby came to symbolize the rejected, the religiously wrong, the“pagan”. As a consequence, Egypt’s most conspicuous practice, the worship ofimages, came to be regarded as the greatest sin. Normatively, the distinction isexpressed in a law code which conforms with the narrative in giving the pro-hibition of “idolatry” first priority. In the space that is constructed by the Mosaicdistinction, the worship of images came to be regarded as the absolute horror,falsehood, and apostasy. Polytheism and idolatry were seen as the same formof religious error . The second commandment is a commentary on the first . . .Images are automatically “other gods”, because the true god is invisible andcannot be iconically represented19.The mosaic distinction, then, takes concrete shape in the form of the truereligion of the one invisible God, defined by its rejection of the falsereli-gion of idols.Idolatry as the rhetorical “other” of monotheism often came to be associ-ated with danger and immorality, but clearly the more basic procedure ofexclusion relied on the opposition between truth and error. There is no obvi-ous danger in worshiping idols—quite the contrary, pagans would considerit dangerous to neglect such worship—, and it must have been very puzzlingto pagans that Jews and Christians often described it in moral terms asARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 231"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"232WOUTER J. HANEGRAAFF20The connotations of idolatry with sexual transgression and immorality (e.g. infidelity, pros-titution, nymphomania) are pervasive in the Hebrew Bible, and are discussed in detail in thefirst chapter (“Idolatry and Betrayal”) of Halbertal & Margalit, Idolatry.21Which became considerably worse if it happened not out of ignorance, but was seen as aconscious choice and commitment; hence the strong association in the Hebrew Bible of idola-try with sexual infidelity. As explained by Halbertal and Margalit, ‘[t]hrough the root metaphorof marriage, God’s relationship to Israel is construed by the prophets as exclusive. Within themarriage metaphor God is the jealous and betrayed husband, Israel is the unfaithful wife, andthe third parties in the triangle—the lovers—are the other gods. Idolatry, then, is the wife’sbetrayal of the husband with strangers, with lovers who had no shared biography with Israel,the other gods whom Israel never knew’ (Idolatry, 237; cf. detailed discussion on 9-36).22I cannot here go into the juridical aspects of this development. For an excellent discussionfocused on the case of astrology, see von Stuckrad, Das Ringen um die Astrologie, 782-797.What was perceived as the irrationality or insanity of heretical and “pagan” belief (see e.g. theEdict of Emperor Theodosius, quoted in Von Stuckrad, o.c., 797: ‘dementes vesanosque . . .haeretici dogmatis’) could be sanctioned by prohibition and persecution. 23The only way in which anyone can possibly deny this, is by reverting to the concept that“Christianity” consists only of “trueChristianity”. Such an approach is obviously unacceptablefrom any historical and academic perspective; nevertheless it has been basic to traditional Churchhistory, and occasionally this is even openly admitted by Church historians themselves (see therepresentative case of Bakhuizen van den Brink discussed in my ‘The Dreams of Theology’).24The cases of Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism are too well known to require biblio-graphical support. As for Hermetism, see e.g. Moreschini, Storia dell’ermetismo cristianoandRoelof van den Broek, Paolo Lucentini, Vittoria Perrone Compagni, and Antoine Faivre,‘Hermetic Literature I, II, IV’, in: Hanegraaff et al., DGWE. For Zoroastrianism the standardreference is Stausberg, Faszination Zarathusthra. For popular culture, among a flood of stud-ies see e.g. Harmening, Superstitio, Flint, The Rise of Magic, or Keith Thomas’s classic Reli-gion and the Decline of Magic. With the possible exception of Aristotelianism, the “idolatrous”“whoredom”20; such associations naturally followed, however, in the wakeof the prior perception, basic to monotheism, of pagan idolatry as falsebelief21. And this category of error, which in contemporary Western societyis sanctioned by no more than ridicule, became the object of grave prohibi-tions in the original Jewish context and later throughout the history ofChristianity. Simply to be wrong constituted a capital offense22.The construction of a “pagan other” is the first crucial move in the GrandPolemical Narrative by which mainstream Western culture has been con-struing its own identity. It is easy to demonstrate that, as a matter of histor-ical fact, ideas and traditions integral to paganism have nevertheless beenessential components of Christianity from very early on23, and have contin-ued to exert an enormous influence throughout the history of Western culture: obvious examples are Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, but alsoHermetism and even Zoroastrianism in elite culture, or the enormous vari-ety of pagan practices that have always continued to thrive in popular cul-ture24. But in the imagination of Christians this factual omnipresence ofARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 232"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE233dimension of the traditions was quite obvious: one thinks of the practice of telestikè(animationof statues) in Neoplatonic theurgy, the criticism (since Augustine, and greatly emphasized byWilliam of Auvergne) of Hermetic idolatry as evident from Asclepius23-24/37-38, the tradi-tional status of Zoroaster as the inventor of magic (inseparable, as will be seen, from idolatry),and the generally “idolatrous” nature or implications of many “folklore” traditions in Christianity(e.g. use of talismans, veneration of statues of saints). 25For a longer development of this point, see my ‘The Dreams of Theology’. 26Hence historians should beware of creating their own polemical simplifications. One couldargue that the present paper, and my ‘Dreams of Theology’ article, are themselves examples ofa polemical discourse. Although I do not wish to construe “theologians” as an artificial enemy,it is true that they are indeed a target in sofar as they confuse myth and reality; and althoughthe simplification necessary in any polemical discourse is explicitly incompatible with the veryposition I am defending, I cannot avoid it altogether if I want to make myself understood. Ifthis proves anything, it is that me and my opponents find ourselves in the same predicament,insofar as none of us can claim the virtue of an “uncontaminated purity” as opposed to the“error” of our opponents. Which is, in fact, exactly my point.paganism in Christianity has been obscured with remarkable success by thepower of polemical discourse25. This discourse rested upon an imaginal con-struct: the ideal concept of the Church as the “pure”, “uncontaminated”,“healthy” body of Christ which continuously needs to be defended againstthe danger of “attack”, “contamination”, “infection” and so on, by its ene-mies. Few Christians would deny that such contamination often did takeplace—after all, any claim that the historical (rather than the ideal) Churchwas entirely pure and healthy would amount to denying the presence of sinand the need for redemption. But the ambiguities, complexities and generalmessiness of historical reality made it all the more necessary to uphold theclarity of the ideal.Accordingly, our concern here is not with the unavoidable gap betweenspiritual ideal and earthly realities, but with the common confusion betweenthose two in the practice of historiography, which has consistently sought toexorcize the paganism integral to historical Christianity by presenting it as“other”. Theologically such a rhetorical procedure was not only understand-able but necessary: as a “counter-religion” born from the monotheistic rejec-tion of idolatry, Christianity would not have been able to define its ownidentity otherwise. Nevertheless, from a consistent historical perspective—which defines its very identity (!) by opposing demonstrable facts againstpious rhetoric, contingency against providence, diversity against unicity, complexity against simplicity, and indeed relativity against dogmatic truth-claims26—such procedures do confuse myth with reality, and are simply incorrect.ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 233"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"234WOUTER J.

This narrative of “who,what and how we want to be” relies upon a concept of who, what and howwe do notwant to be: pagan, or associated with anything pagan. But regard-less of such wishes, as a matter of historical fact paganism is and always hasbeen part of what we are: it is an integral part of Western religion, cultureand civilization, and cannot be separated from what lived Christianity hasbeen from the very beginning. This fact, however, could not be openlyacknowledged, or even be allowed to surface into conscious awareness; andas a result, a “space” was created in the collective imagination that was occu-pied by the pagan “other”. In the course of a long development, this spaceeventually developed into what we now refer to as Western esotericism.The Construction of Heresy: Christianity versus GnosticismAll the later stages in the development of the Grand Polemical Narrative areto some extent variations on the basic opposition of pagan versus nonpagan,which is in its bare essence an opposition of error versus truth. But theyadded new rhetorical twists to it, which variously emphasized the variantsof “danger”, “immorality” and “irrationality” (or “madness”); and they addeda wealth of new contents, in the form of various ideas and beliefs that hadnot been present in the original imaginary of “paganism” or had remainedimplicit rather than overt.“Gnosticism” is a particularly clear example of an artificial construct thatcame to be reified by means of polemical discourse—so successfully, in fact,that almost all academic specialists throughout the 19th and 20th centurieshave assumed that it referred to a historically identifiable current or move-ment. It is sobering to realize that the very term “gnosticism” was inventedas late as 1669 by (again) Henry More, as a pejorative umbrella concept forwhat polemicists like Justin Martyr, Irenaeus of Lyons, Hippolytus of Romeand Ipiphanius of Salamis had rejected as heresy in the 2nd and 3rd cen-turies. Significantly, in view of the previous section, More’s primary focusof attack was Catholicism, described as ‘a spice of the old abhorred Gnos-ticism’ and a false prophecy that seduces true Christians into (guess what . . .)idolatry!27ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 234"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE235included as an appendix to the Exposition.

And Karen L. King has provided use-ful discussions not only of how “gnosticism” was construed as the funda-mental heresy, but also of how the heresiological polemics of the 2nd and3rd centuries have provided modern scholarship with its basic terminologi-cal conventions and theoretical assumptions29. Her discussion providesdetailed confirmation of my basic point that “gnosticism” is an artificialpolemical construct that has always consisted in the imagination rather thanin historical reality, and could be created and kept alive only by means ofsimplification. King’s conclusion says it all: . . .the polemicists have reigned supreme for most of the twentieth century;scholars have tended to evaluate Gnosticism negatively, and on nearly the samegrounds as the polemicists did heresy. Gnosticism has been described as theo-logically inferior and ethically flawed; as an artificial and syncretic parasite; asan individualistic, nihilistic, and escapist religion incapable of forming any kindof true moral community. Scholars have included an increasingly wide range ofdiverse materials under the category of Gnosticism, and yet they have chafedat the problem of defining its essential characteristics. But above all, we havebeen mistakenly preoccupied with determining its origin and tracing its genealog-ical relation to orthodox Christianity because we have unwittingly reified arhetorical category into a historical entity30.As in the case of paganism, “gnosticism” was rhetorically excluded primar-ily as being based upon theological “error”; hence its usefulness for defin-ing the polemicists’ identity as representatives of “orthodoxy”—upholders ofthe right doctrine. Other negative features followed as a matter of course:“gnosticism” is “dangerous” because it stimulates individualism and hencedivision, that is to say, it undermines legitimate authority; those who lack asolid grounding in the truth are bound to lapse into “immoral” behaviour,and of course examples (such as the well-known accusations of sexual lib-ertinism) are readily found; and their rejection of philosophy as a sufficientway towards divine knowledge could be used to present the gnostic emphasisARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 235"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"236WOUTER J.

Furthermore, as with“paganism”, it is striking how frequently one encounters the language ofpurity and contamination.As I emphasized earlier, the imaginary nature of “gnosticism” does notmean that it did not correspond with anything real. But instead of any well-defined “current”, “movement”, or even “religion” of gnosticism31, what wedo find in the Roman empire during the later hellenistic period is a diffuseand complex type of religiosity, based upon the pursuit of gnosis or salvificesoteric knowledge32. It included not only what Williams would like us tocall “biblical demiurgical” traditions, but also Christians such as Clement ofAlexandria and the currents that inspired the hermetic literature; and as thoseexamples readily demonstrate, it ignored religious boundaries and could manifest itself in pagan and Christian, as well as in Jewish contexts. Thisfluidity and flexibility may have been one reason why the polemicists feltthreatened by it. The construction of heresy, as explained by King, ‘was onlyone part of the larger rhetorical enterprise of establishing the boundaries ofnormative Christianity, which also had to distinguish itself from other formsof belief and practice, notably Judaism and paganism’33. The basic polemi-cal strategies were similar in all these cases, but the targets were recogniz-ably different. Hence it made sense for polemicists to reduce the problem ofgnosis to its manifestations that called themselves Christian. By and large,this is what became the heresy later called “gnosticism”. Other manifesta-tions of gnosis could be subsumed under the umbrellas of Judaism andPaganism, and refuted as part of relatively separate polemics.The Construction of Magic: Christianity versus Demon-WorshipThe term magiké(the art of the mágoi, or Persian priests) originated withthe Greeks, who used it to indicate ‘a ritual practitioner occupied with pri-vate rites whose legitimacy was contested and often, at least in later times,marginalised and forbidden’34. From the beginning, mageiawas an impre-cise but generally negative term, referring to what was seen as the oppositeof legitimate and overt religious practice35. There were many equivalents toARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 236"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE23736Graf, ‘Magic II’, 719.37Kieckhefer, Magic in the Middle Ages, 10-11.magikéor aspects of it, such as the Greek góes(someone who communi-cates with the dead, hence goeteía), pharmakeútria(a woman using herbsand drugs) or analutés(a specialist in undoing binding-spells), and the Latinsaga(witch), veneficus(poisener) or maleficus(evildoer)36. Early Christianauthors in the Roman empire inherited the concept of magiaand its equiv-alents as a category of exclusion, but naturally understood it within their ownframework of true versus false religion, that is to say, the opposition ofChristian belief against pagan idolatry. Up through the 12th century, whichsaw the emergence of new concepts of magia naturalis, magic in Christiandiscourse became therefore equivalent to trafficing with demons37, who, aswas well understood, were the very same entities that had manifested them-selves as “gods” to the pagans.Hence it is quite clear that the Christian discourse of magic came to occupya major part of the “space” in the collective imagination that had been cre-ated by the original monotheism-paganism distinction. In that process, how-ever, the imaginary “other” acquired a new aura. From the perspective ofanti-pagan counter-religion, the Greek and Roman concept of magic as ille-gitimate or forbidden practice became something much more dramatic, bybeing “demonized” as the domain of the Enemy of Mankind. As explainedby Valerie Flint,The characterization of “magic” as the work solely of wicked demons, and of“sorcerers” and “magicians” as their servants, stemmed from two convergentdevelopments . In the first place, the concept of the “daimon” changed . . . In thesecond, “magia”, or “magic”, became the chiefterm whereby the most power-ful of the emerging religious systems described, and condemned, the super-natural exercises of their enemies. In brief, as organized and institutionalizedreligious practice was asked to play an ever more prominent place in the dailylife of humans, as an exclusive form of monotheism commanded much of thispractice, and as Christianity, in particular, assumed . . . a quasi-imperial role, theolder, looser, views of the dealings of human beings with the “daimones” couldno longer be tolerated. The “daimon” was translated, then, into the evil demonof Judaic and Christian literature . . . Thus, those humans who looked to obtainsupernatural help in the older ways and through an older or different “daimon”,came to be viewed by many as terminally deluded, and their exercises seen asmagic as its worst. Sorcerers and magicians were then “demonized” by beingdeclared subject only to the demonic forces of evil, and were described as offer-ing reinforcement to the most wicked of these forces’ designs.

While one may seek to refute the errors of pagans, gnostics, orheretics generally, in an effort to win them over to the truth, such an approachis useless in the case of demons: the important thing is, rather, to protectindividuals and society against the enemy. And because—as rightly pointedout by Flint—an enormous variety of activities had now come to be coveredby the same term “magic”, they could all be perceived as manifestations ofone and the same threat. Again, we see how simplification is essential to apolemical agenda. The assumption of demonic agency became in fact theonly universally agreed-upon characteristic of “magic”, which now func-tioned as a polemical waste-basket category lumping together such widelydifferent things as divination (itself a category including various techniques,e.g. geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, astrology, observationof flight and sounds of birds, or of the entrails of animals, and so on)39, evo-cation of angels, demons or the dead, curse tablets and image magic, amuletsand talismans, the activities of witches, enchantment by magical use of words,ligatures, and so on.Nowadays, all these “exceptive arts” or varieties of “superstition”40areroutinely associated—by specialized academics no less than by the generalaudience—with “magic” (or with the more recent term “the occult”); andthroughout the history of Christianity, theologians have sought to convincetheir fellow Christians that these activities were unlawful, dangerous, im-moral, deluded, and wrong. Of course, the mere fact that they needed to doso proves that many Christians didpractice them. There is no particular rea-son to assume that, in doing so, they intended to choose the devil’s part;more likely they simply expected to gain something useful from these artsand techniques, and did not see why they should be so incompatible withChristian faith. Again, I would emphasize that from a historical point of view,all such practices, no matter how far removed they may be from standardconcepts of normative Christianity, must be recognized as integral parts ofthe tapestry of Christianity as a living culture41.

One goodexample of this is the Calvinist polemicist Philips van Marnix, Lord of St. Aldegonde (1540-1598), whose biting satire De Biëncorf der H.

In the practice of church history and largelyof history in general, however, the standard phenomenon of a confusionbetween polemical concepts and historical realities has reigned supreme. Justas in the case of “gnosticism”, the terms and categories of the polemicistshave (consciously or unconsciously) been taken over by academics and havebeen allowed to strongly influence the way we have perceived and construedthe history of Christianity and of Western culture as a whole.The Re-Construction of Paganism: Protestantism versus RomanCatholicismThat “paganism” and “magic” had actually become integral parts of Chris-tianity was keenly perceived by the leaders of the Reformation, who accord-ingly sought to exclude Roman Catholicism from the domain of legitimatereligion. Hence history repeated itself in the 16th century: the Reformation—and Calvinism most in particular—defined its very identity by polemicallyexcluding Roman Catholicism as the “other” of true Christianity, in a waythat is structurally similar to the cases we have just explored. In this process,the emphasis shifts back again from “danger” towards “error”42.The relation between “paganism” and “magic” in this Protestant discourseis extremely complex, with the concept of “idolatry” as arguably a majorpoint of connection; but this is hardly the place to go into that problematicsin any detail. Suffice it to say that the truth-error distinction basic to tradi-tional anti-pagan polemics is given a vehement new sting in the newProtestant variety, by means of being framed in terms of a distinction betweenbelief and practice. This was something new. In a Roman Catholic contextthe true doctrine was not only embodied in the Church, but also rituallyenacted in its central ceremonies; therefore by religious practice, the faithfulARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 239"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"240WOUTER J.

The religious use of images may be included underritual practice, regardless of whether images are seen as mere “symbols” or, more concretely,as direct representations or embodiments of what they represent.44I am not aware of any major studies that explore systematically and in detail to what extentthe explicit defense of “paganism” and “magic” in the wake of the rediscovery of hermetism—by Catholics such as Ficino, Lazzarelli, Pico della Mirandola and so on, and often combinedwith defenses of that other traditional enemy, Judaism—played a role in Protestant polemicsagainst Roman Catholicism. On the face of it, one would expect that the phenomenon of aparticipated in the truth. Not so from a Protestant perspective. Salvation comesfrom faith alone, that is to say, not from ritual participation, good works, orany other kind of practice. Together with Roman Catholicism, this principlehas the effect of very cleanly and effectively excluding both “paganism” and“magic” from the domain of legitimate Christianity.The same simple Protestant principle has exerted an enormous influenceover how the nature of “religion” has come to be perceived since the 16thcentury, in academic contexts and generally—with far-reaching but usuallyoverlooked implications for the study of Western esotericism. The modernstudy of religion has only slowly managed to break free from the crypto-Protestant idea that religion is based upon—and hence defined by—“belief ”(i.e. upon the adherence to certain propositions held to be true), and manyscholars continue to think in these terms even today. Applied to the historyof Christianity, this has the effect of calling attention away from its sym-bolic, mythical and ritual aspects43, in favour of an artificial concentrationon Christian doctrine as supposedly representing the core of what Christianityis all about for the believer. In terms of the Grand Polemical Narrative sucha reduction makes perfect sense, but historically it is extremely misleading,for in many respects an approach based upon the Protestant principle is sim-ply incapable of describing who Christians have actually been, what theyhave believed, and how they have behaved. Any dimension of lived Chris-tianity that does not fit the pattern is simply not registered. Once again, con-fusion between polemical concepts and historical realities caused the latterto be perceived from a simplifying ideological angle, and the resulting pic-ture was taken for granted by later generations as factual description.With respect to Western esotericism, the contribution of Protestantism tothe Grand Polemical Narrative has had a double effect. First, it stronglyamplified the already existing practice of excluding “paganism”, “gnosti-cism” and “magic”—domains which, however, as every student of Westernesotericism knows, had just been witnessing an important revival engineeredby Catholics in the half century preceding the Reformation44—from theARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 240"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE241hermetic/neoplatonic Christianity defended by Catholics would make it an ideal target forProtestants, as demonstrating how deeply the Roman Catholic church had sunk.45See e.g. the example of Calvinism briefly discussed in my ‘Dreams of Theology’.46See the discussions of “mythological gnosis” in van den Broek, ‘Gnosticism I’.47Couliano, Eros and Magic, 193.48See in this regard Bräunlein, ‘Bildakte’.

Augustine’s discussion is based upon the conventional nature of signs,whose only meaningful use is ‘the transfer of a motus animi, a concept, from one mind todomain of Christianity. And second, it promoted an approach to religion ingeneral that emphasizes only doctrine and verbal/scriptural expression. As aresult, if the excluded “other” came in view at all, not only was it automat-ically put in a negative light, but even more seriously, its symbolic, mythi-cal and ritual aspects were bound to be systematically ignored, played downor “translated” into something that could be verbalized and understood indoctrinal terms. Apart from the fact that symbolic, mythical and ritual dimen-sions are integral parts of anykind of religion (including even the mostextreme manifestations of Protestantism itself45), for our present concerns itis essential to see that the types of religiosity which had been excluded as“other” in Western culture had always been characterized precisely by astrong emphasis on those very dimensions: paganism is largely practice sup-ported by myth (and flourishing in the veneration of images), gnosticism isnothing without its rich mythology46, magic is eminently something done andnot just something believed in, and the role of images and symbols is per-vasive in all these domains.In his study of eros and magic in the Renaissance, Ioan P. Couliano hasanalyzed the “censorship of the imaginary” as a historical process with pro-found effects, that developed in the wake of the Reformation47; and onemerely needs to think of the iconoclasm of Protestantism and its pervasiverhetoric against Roman Catholic “idolatry”, to realize that the attack onimages cannot be separated (except conceptually and analytically) from thecensorship of religious “practice” and ritual48. By seeking to exclude RomanCatholicism from legitimate Christianity and include it in the pagan/magicaldomain of the “other”, the Protestant discourse cemented its own identity asthe anti-imaginal, anti-mythical and anti-ritualistic counterreligion par excel-lence; and this, in turn, could not but amplify long-standing associations of“truth” with the clarity of words, and “error” with the ambiguity of images49.ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 241"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"242WOUTER J. HANEGRAAFFanother’. Demons, however, are not interested in clarity but in entrapment of human beings;and therefore demonic signs are necessarily ambiguous and violate the rational transfer of con-ceptual meanings: ‘the transfer of meaning . . . must somehow be incompletein demonic lan-guage: the intended meaning never reaches the human recipient whole, for if it did, it wouldnot “lead” anywhere. The communication is always broken off before it is fully understood,and hence the hearer is made curious, tempted to further communication (aiming to “complete”the transfer of thought), thus proceeding farther and farther into the trap’. The demons play onhuman curiosity: ‘The kind of appetite that leads to entrapment by demonic signifiers is curiosi-tas, the perverse and insatiable . . . desire to know things for their own sake . One might evensay that the “appetite” designated by the term curiositasis an appetite for signs themselves,rather than for meaning as it is embodied in signs used appropriately’. Such misuse of signs isa perversion of divine worship itself, and hence directly related to idolatry: ‘the diviner, thecurious or superstitious person, looks to the sign as thing rather than to the thing the sign standsfor, just as idolaters look to the statue of a god, to creature rather than Creator’. Augustinepoints out that the rejection of idols should be extended to ‘all imaginary signs, which lead toworship of idols, or worship of creation and its parts in place of God’ (De doctrinaII,23.36).Idolatry, then, becomes a subcategory of all practices involving “imaginary signs”, i.e. ‘signsof imaginary things, conducive to (or the product of) fantastic imaginings, rather than reasonor good sense’. But the ascetic ideal of a religion based only on words was hard, perhapsimpossible, to maintain in practice. It is significant that some of the mostimportant innovative currents in the history of “Western esotericism” sincethe 16th century emerged precisely from Protestant foundations: notably theRosicrucian Manifestoes and the Christian Theosophical current linked tothe work of Jacob Boehme both sprouted from Lutheran foundations anddemonstrate that myth, symbolism and the religious imagination could flour-ish in a Protestant context. But it is no less true that precisely these currents,together with their Hermetic/Neoplatonic and Paracelsian origins, came tobe branded as Schwärmerei(“enthusiasm”) and heresy by mostly Protestantpolemicists, and finally ended up enriching the space of the pagan-gnostic-magical “other” with new concepts, myths and images.Ehregott Daniel Colberg’s polemic against Das Platonisch-Hermetisches[sic] Christenthum(1690-1691) plays an important role here, as arguably thefirst book to present what we now refer to as Western esotericism as a specificdomain in its own right. Colberg saw the connections that historians ofWestern esotericism still emphasize today: a specific type of “Platonic-Hermetic Christianity” had come into existence since the 15th century, andhad further developed into currents such as Paracelsianism, Rosicrucianismand Boehmian theosophy. Colberg sought to warn his readers against thisdanger, but only a few years later Gottfried Arnold’s famous Impartial Historyof Churches and Heresiestook the side of the heretics in what amounted toARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 242"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE24350Colberg’s and Arnold’s importance in this regard seems to have been first noted by Faivre& Voss, ‘Western Esotericism’, 54, and cf. the longer discussion in Faivre, Theosophy,Imagination, Tradition, 11-12. More recently it was discussed at length in Neugebauer-Wölk,‘Esoterik und Christentum vor 1800’, and see also Hanegraaff, ‘The Study of Western Eso-tericism’, 490. Neugebauer-Wölk’s very interesting discussion and criticism of the approachoutlined in my ‘Dreams of Theology’, and its implications for how we look at the relationbetween Western esotericism and Christianity, require a much more detailed response than wouldbe possible here. As for Protestant anti-esoteric (or more specifically, anti-theosophical) dis-course more generally, see in particular Faivre, Theosophy, Imagination, Tradition, 16-19. Faivreseems to have been the first to call attention to the importance of Protestant polemics in thehistory of Christian theosophy and of Western esotericism more generally.51See Gilly, ‘Das Bekenntnis zur Gnosis’, 416-422.52Hanegraaff, ‘Introduction’, in: DGWE, x.a counter-polemics against orthodoxy50. And in 1703 he published Abrahamvon Franckenberg’s Theophrastia Valentiniana(orig. 1629, but not printedbefore): the first known apology of gnosticism51. Although the terminologyused to refer to the “other” has always remained quite fluid and hence con-fusing, “hermetic” eventually emerged as a particularly convenient term sinceit could be connected to so many aspects of the field: the hermetic writingsthemselves, the traditional “hermetic art” of alchemy, and hence all types ofNaturphilosophiesomehow associated with Paracelsianism. In sum, as I con-cluded elsewhere,In a manner very similar to what happened in Late Antiquity, with the reificationof “Gnosticism” as a distinct heretical system opposed to Christianity, the con-cept of a distinct system or tradition of “Hermeticism” (comprising . . . the entiremixture of hermetic literature, neoplatonic speculation, kabbalah, alchemy, astrol-ogy, and magic outlined above) seems to have emerged in the 17th century andto have been taken up especially in Protestant contexts. It is mainly against thisbackground that the proponents of the Enlightenment came to present it as theepitome of unreason and superstition52.This new concept of “hermeticism”—in fact an umbrella term that comprisesthe entire “referential corpus” central to what modern scholars understandby modern “Western esotericism”—therefore emerged as a Protestant polem-ical concept. It is essentially a late 17th/18th-century development of theGrand Polemical Narrative whose earlier stages I have been tracing. Thespace originally occupied by “paganism” in the monotheistic imagination,and which later came to include “gnosticism” and “magic” in the Christianimagination, had now been further embellished by the revived and Chris-tianized paganisms of Neoplatonism and Hermetism, various forms ofChristian kabbalah, Paracelsianism, Rosicrucianism, and Christian Theosophy.The arts or disciplines of astrology, alchemy and magia naturalishad beenARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 243"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"244WOUTER J.

It is usually impossible in this context to make anysharp separation between strictly scientific or philosophical polemics andpurely religious ones, and hence we encounter the basic oppositions dis-cussed above in the debates of science and natural philosophy no less thanin those pertaining to theology. For the very same reason, however, the 16thand 17th centuries are notcharacterized by anything resembling the clearcutopposition of “science against superstition” or “reason against unreason” sofamiliar from traditional historiography in the wake of the Enlightenment. Itwas simply not typical for scientists to oppose “science” against “religion”and reject the latter; instead, scientists usually saw themselves as taking theside of truth, which naturally included true religion, against whatever theysaw as error. One clear illustration is the case of the witchcraft debate. Inhis groundbreaking monograph of 1997, Stuart Clark explains why and howthe ‘reassuring story of the victory of science over magic, of reason overignorance, and, in the sphere of demonology itself, of scepticism over belief’53has been thoroughly undermined by what we now know about the “scientificrevolution”: . . .men who were undoubtedly leading exponents of the new styles of naturalphilosophy, who championed the Royal Society, and were, some of them, fel-lows of it, went out of their way to insist on the reality of witchcraft and theimportance of demonic activity in the natural world. On the other hand, neitherof the leading critics of witchcraft beliefs who went into print in this period—John Webster and John Wagstaffe—were “new scientists” . . . Arguably the mostpowerful of all sceptical treatments of witchcraft was still Reginald Scot’s—reissued in 1651, 1654, and 1665 but originally published in 1584, and steepedin theological, rather than natural scientific orthodoxies54.ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 244"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE24555I am thinking here of the role played by the concept of “qualitates occultae”, on whichsee Hutchison, ‘What Happened to Occult Qualities’, Millen, ‘The Manifestion of OccultQualities’, and Hanegraaff, ‘Occult / Occultism’.56It has become very clear in recent decades that the idealized picture of “Enlightenmentdiscourse” as codified in historiography since the 19th century does not match—once again, forthe same story repeats itself over and over again—its actual complexity. See in this regard e.g.McIntosh, The Rose Cross and the Age of Reason, Neugebauer-Wölk, Aufklärung und Esoterik,and various contributions in Trepp & Lehmann, Antike Weisheit und kulturelle Praxis. 57The negative connotations of that word were not yet obvious in the 18th century; see e.g.Court de Gébelin’s 9-volume Le monde primitif(1773-1782).In other words, the traditional type of religious polemics that saw magic asbased upon demonic activity remained in full force; and progressive scien-tists tended to continue believing in demons rather than rejecting them asfigments of the superstitious imagination (as they were supposed to havedone according to later historians). Likewise, in lieu of many other exam-ples, it may suffice here to mention the famous cases (which can easily beexpanded) of the practicing astrologer Kepler, or the alchemical activities ofNewton and Boyle—all of them devout Christians—, to make the by nowuncontroversial point that the so-called “occult sciences” were integral partsof the history of the scientific revolution. Obviously this does not mean thatsubjects like magic, alchemy or astrology were never targets of attack fromscientific perspectives that we now recognize as “progressive” (see e.g. thewell-known case of Robert Fludd, attacked by Mersenne, Gassendi andKepler). The point is, rather, that defenders and opponents could be foundon both sides of the divide (or rather, the grey area or no man’s land) thatdivided the new science from traditional approaches in natural philosophy.Even leaving aside other considerations55, this in itself is sufficient to demon-strate that a rejection of the “occult sciences” cannot reasonably be construedas representative of the scientific revolution as a whole.Of course that revolution eventually led to the emergence of what we nowrecognize as “genuine science”, and against that background 18th-centuryEnlightenment discourse—or rather, the simplified versions of that discoursewhich eventually, during the 19th century, came to be perceived as such56—did polemically oppose reason against irrationality and science against super-stition or “the occult”. In doing so, it could fall back on the entire existingreservoir of excluded “others” and their associated stereotypes, inherited byEnlightenment ideologues and their intellectual heirs from monotheistic andChristian polemical discourse, but now rejected for new and different rea-sons.

Referred to as “fetishism” since Charles de Brosse (1760),idolatry was routinely associated with “magic”, and both were seen as basedupon “wrong thinking”. “Fetishism” was intellectually inferior because itrelied on a failure to distinguish between a material image and the conceptsymbolized by it; and “magic” (frequently used as a synonym for “occultphilosophy” or “occult science”) relied on the equally confused belief thatoccult “correspondences” merely imagined in the human mind reflected realconnections in the material world58. The former type of approach clearlyreflects traditional Christian perceptions of paganism and magic as “wrongreligion”, whereas the latter reflects perceptions of magia naturalisand allother “occult” disciplines as “wrong science”; and in both cases, the implicit“intellectualist” bias which takes it for granted that religious behaviour isrooted in intellectual processes is clearly a legacy of the Protestant principlediscussed earlier. It goes without saying, furthermore, that the traditionalassociation of all these domains with demonic activity strongly amplifiedtheir perception as primitive and backward, based upon the fears and delu-sions that had dominated human consciousness for so long and that werenow finally being driven away—or so it was hoped—by the light of reason.In sum: the space in the collective imagination occupied by the “other” ofmonotheism and official Christianity, which had grown and developedthrough the various stages outlined above, had now finally been transformedinto the space containing Das Andere der Vernunft59. As such, it has exertedan incalculable influence over the academic study of religion and of culturein general during the 19th and through most of the 20th century. TheEnlightenment defined its own identity by means of a polemical discoursethat presented itself as entirely rational, while excluding all forms of “super-stition” as wholly irrational and hence misguided60. And this superstitionincluded much more than the dogmas of the church: the entire “hermetic”compound that had come to be perceived as a quasi-autonomous “current”or “movement” by Protestant polemicists around the end of the 17th centurywas readily available for assuming the role of the “other” of reason.

Fromthe 18th century on and throughout the 19th, as a by-product of seculariza-tion and the disenchantment of the world, one sees them engaged in attemptsat construing their own identity by means of the “invention of tradition”:essentially adopting the Protestant and Enlightenment category of the rejectedother, they sought to defend it as based upon a superior worldview withancient roots, and opposed to religious dogmatism and narrow-minded ration-alism. This process is part of a new kind of polemical discourse, in whichself-styled “esotericists”, “occultists”, “magicians”, and eventually “pagans”as well, self-consciously define themselves in opposition to religious and sci-entific orthodoxies. The rhetorics and strategies of exclusion at work herewould merit a separate analysis, but fall beyond the limits I have set myselfin the present article63.3.ImplicationsI have argued that the perception of “Western Esotericism” as a domain ofresearch in its own right is the historical outcome of a polemical discoursethat ultimately goes all the way back to the origins of monotheism, and inARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 247"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"248WOUTER J.

It is by the end ofthe 17th century in a Protestant context that this field was first conceptual-ized in a manner roughly equivalent to modern scholarly understandings, andits perception as a domain different not only from mainstream religion butalso from normative science and philosophy is rooted in Enlightenment dis-course. This account clearly confirms the nature of “Western Esotericism”as a theoretical construct instead of a natural term, and is incompatible withcommon religionist ideas according to which there exists someting “essen-tially” esoteric. Nothing “is” esoteric unless it is construed as such by some-body for some reason.I believe it would be too simple to attribute the traditional resistance ofacademics against the study of Western esotericism merely to the fact thatthey reject its perspectives from their own “Enlightenment” worldview, oreven to the feeling that by taking such a field seriously one gives it somelegitimacy. Both certainly play a role, but I would suggest that on a deeperlevel, the fact that—until recently—the study of Western esotericism wasalmost completely excluded from academic research finds its explanation inthe very nature of polemics as such. The process of simplification that isbasic to any polemical discourse requires that access to detailed factual infor-mation be restricted as much as possible. We know this from the role playedby secrecy, dissimulation and propaganda in actual warfare64(whence thetruism that “the first casualty in any war is truth”), and likewise, with respectto Western esotericism detailed factual information is simply not in the inter-est of the dominant party. I hasten to add that I do not mean this in any con-spirational sense65; what I have in mind is the simple fact that in order forany polemical rhetoric to be effective, things should be kept simple and toomuch information about the “other” will only create confusion. In that regard,the academic study of Western esotericism is clearly the natural enemy ofthe Grand Polemical Narrative—not because it chooses the “enemy’s side”,but because as an academic discipline it is committed to the expansion of knowledge from a perspective of ideological neutrality.

The deep irony is that pre-cisely the eminently academic enterprise of expanding our knowledge ofWestern religion and culture by means of critical and unbiased research, ifapplied consistently, is bound to eventually expose reigning polemical nar-ratives as mere simplifying constructs, and hence threaten the safety and sta-bility of conventional academic identities that are built on them. Resistanceagainst such deconstruction is psychologically understandable, but is never-theless in direct conflict with themethodological principle basic to the aca-demic enterprise as it developed in the wake of the Enlightenment (and which,in my opinion, must be preserved at all costs): the “practice of criticism”,whose only commitment is to truth and which therefore cannot afford toimpose restrictions on itself out of respect for any tradition or authority66.From the above it should be clear that, in my opinion, the importance ofthe study of Western esotericism goes far beyond a mere “academic inter-est” in some historical currents and ideas that happen to have been neglectedby earlier generations. On the contrary, this domain of research should berecognized as centrally important to historians of religion and culture becauseit is only by virtue of excluding its basic components—as imagined in thepolemical imagination—from the realm of the acceptable that Western cul-ture as such has been able to define its very identity. If I am correct in argu-ing that the most essential components of that identity are at bottom polemicalconcepts, it follows that we cannot understand them in isolation, as if theyexist in and for themselves. Instead, we need to understand the dynamics ofthe underlying discourse that created them; and this, in turn, requires us totry and step outsidethe latter and analyze it from a neutral point of view.What does this entail? The very attempt (or even just the idea) of makingsuch a step is bound to have disturbing and disorienting effects, because itcommits us to a radical empiricism with profoundly relativistic implications.If we perform the “though experiment” of trying to imagine what Westernhistory might look like if perceived from outside its own foundational dis-course, we find that we have lost all traditional criteria by means of whichwe routinely privilege certain aspects of Western culture or religion as rela-tively “important”, “central”, “serious”, or “profound”, while marginaliz-ing others as less important, eccentric, unserious, superficial and so on.

HANEGRAAFF67I am aware that the approach advocated here cannot fail to evoke associations with thebasic process of psychotherapy. Since it seems to me that such parallels indeed make sense, Imight as well make them explicit. As human individuals [cf. as a culture] we define our adultidentity by rejecting parts of ourselves and repressing them into the realm of the subconscious[cf. the realm of the excluded “other”]. This “shadow” becomes the reservoir of who, what andhow we do not want to be; but it is in fact a significant part of who, what and how we actu-ally are. Rather than facing and confronting the parts of ourselves [cf. of our culture] that wedo not want to own, we tend to project them outside ourselves [cf. “pagans”, “heretics”, “witches”and so on]. Any successful therapeutic process, in contrast, involves a confrontation with thecontents of our subconscious and an effort to integrate them as parts of our own identity. Sincesuch a process requires a breaking down of the barriers we have created to protect our identityand keep it stable, we naturally tend to resist it (out of a fear of chaos, disorientation, and mad-ness). But if we manage to overcome such resistance, we can gain a more complex and multi-leveled understanding of ourselves and are able to redefine our identity accordingly [cf. theradical new and far more complex picture of “Western culture” that must result if its contentsare no longer subdivided along the lines of the Grand Polemical Narrative]. I freely admit that,in my opinion, such a “psychotherapy” of academic research would be healthy and desirable.Narrative not only because we are so used to it (so that we seldom even per-ceive its presence) but also because we feel we would be lost without it: thenarrative protects us from perceiving the full complexity of our own culture.Simplicity is psychologically reassuring, while complexity is hard to dealwith; and the disappearance of traditional lines of demarcations will leaveus in a state of disorientation. All this is entirely correct: if we can manageto step outside the Grand Polemical Narrative, nothing will look the same,the ground will seem to vanish under our feet, and the general impressionwill be that of utter chaos. The only solution in any such situation is not topanic but to simply start looking carefully at what is there, and see what pat-terns emerge67.It would of course be stupid to even suggest that, in pursuing such anapproach, we should forget all the accomplishments of past research and start“from scratch”. To take the most obvious example: the Grand PolemicalNarrative is itself a major pattern, whose very presence is bound to emergeas extremely relevant to understanding the dynamics of Western culture. The difference is that it is now reduced to its proper status as an object forscholarly investigation, rather than being allowed to function as the latter’sfoundation and starting point. This in itself makes it possible for other patterns, different from and unrelated to those that follow from the GrandPolemical Narrative, to come into view as well.

La culture occidentale définit sa propre identité parle moyen d’un Grand Récit Polémique qui exclut certains types de religion, de vision du monde,ou de pratique, lesquels ressortiraient au domaine de “l’Autre”. C’est ainsi que le monothéismedéfinit son identité en rejetant le “paganisme” et l’“idolâtrie”; les premiers théologiens chré-tiens, en rejetant l’hérésie du “gnosticisme”; le christianisme ancien et médiéval en rejetant lamagie comme inspirée par des démons; le Protestantisme, en rejetant le Catholicisme Romaincomme idolâtrie crypto-païenne; et les Lumières, en rejetant toute une série de croyances et depratiques comme liées à l’hermétisme et à “l’occulte”.Par suite de ce processus cumulatif, l’“espace” occupé dans l’imaginaire collectif par l’“Autre”païen s’est peu à peu empli de contenus toujours nouveaux au fur et à mesure que le temps passait, et a continué à se développer, à s’étendre, jusqu’à finir, dans la recherche et le dis-cours académiques dominants, par devenir une sorte de corbeille à papier de “savoir rejeté”.Récemment, des chercheurs ont commencé à se rendre compte que ce terrain, maintenant désignégénéralement sous l’appellation de “Esotérisme occidental”, nécessite une étude sérieuse etimpartiale. D’un point de vue historique, la Grand Récit Polémique, qui est à la base de notreidentité culturelle commune, consiste en une longue série de simplifications successives fondéessur des programmes idéologiques et normatifs. Or, une tâche importante dévolue à la recherchehistorique et critique consiste à apporter un correctif aux faits historiques ainsi dénaturés, et àdévelopper une compréhension plus complexe, plus nuancée, et plus neutre, de la culture occi-dentale. Voir les choses selon cette perspective nouvelle ne saurait perpétuer le programmepolémique de base qui voit dans les idées et les développements de l’“ésotérique” quelque chosequi ferait partie d’une contre-culture des “autres”, dirigée contre le discours dominant. Il s’agit,en revanche, de les analyser en tant que dimension négligée de la culture et de la société engénéral. Une telle approche n’est pas seulement susceptible de nous aider à mieux saisir le sensde la réalité historique; elle est également, et nécessairement, appelée à connaître des implica-tions radicales quant à la manière dont “nous” percevons notre propre identité.ARIES 5,2_f4_225-254I 8/5/05 4:37 PM Page 254"}]
