En , Mirra Alfassa(–), qui avait fait partie de l’entourage de Théon, se rendit en Inde et rencon-tra Sri Aurobindo (–). On trouve dans le «yoga intégral» d’Aurobindo, baséprincipalement sur les Upanishad, plusieurs idées qui rappellent celles de la philosophiecosmique, et d’autres qui évoquent les doctrines de l’école de Luria.

IntroductionMany forms of Western Esotericism claim Eastern roots or influence. Someof these claims have little historical basis, as in the “pseudo-Egyptianism” ofseventeenth-century Hermetic writers such as Robert Fludd, Michael Maier,and Athanasius Kircher.1In other instances the Oriental influence is well1)Yates,Rosicrucian Enlightenment, , . For Renaissance Egyptomania in general, seeDijkstra, ‘Mysteries of the Nile’, –."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –attested, as in the Sabbatean reinterpretation of the kabbalah by SabbataiZevi and Nathan of Gaza during the seventeenth century.2Helena Petro-vna Blavatsky drew on Egyptian, Indian and other sources in writing theprimary texts of the Theosophical Society at the end of the nineteenth cen-tury.Cases in which the influenceflowed in the other direction, that is, in which aform of Western esotericism had some impact on an Eastern occult or spiritualteaching, are more rare. I leave out of consideration modern reinterpretationsof Indian, Islamic or Chinese teachings by Western exegetes and practitioners.Such reinterpretations are legion; they began with the European discovery ofOriental knowledge in the eighteenth century and continue to this day.3Muchless common are cases in which the formulator of a significant Eastern teachingwas directly or indirectly influenced by Western esoteric ideas or practices. Thecase I study in this paper may be the only one in which ideas with a kabbalisticpedigree left some trace on the writings of a notable Indian spiritual teacher.Whether this trace can rightly be characterized as influence depends on howthe term influence is understood, and I will look into this question in theconcluding section of the paper.The Indian figure whose teachings I will examine is Sri Aurobindo (birthname Aurobindo Ghose, –). Best known today as a spiritual leaderwith a large following, Aurobindo is also rememberedas a revolutionary politi-cian, a poet, and a philosopher. Born in Calcutta, he was sent to England atthe age of seven, and received a solid classical education at St. Paul’s School,London, and King’s College, Cambridge. Returning to India in , heimmersed himself in the Indian cultural tradition, reading the classics of San-skrit literature and later the foundational texts of Hinduism: theBhagavadGita,theUpanishads, and theRig Veda. He wrote later that his own phi-losophy ‘was formed first by the study of the Upanishads and the Gita’, butinsisted that the primary source of his ideas was personal spiritual experience,accompanied by ‘knowledge that flowed from above when I sat in medita-tion’.42)Scholem,Major Trends, –.3)In recent years, many critiques of such reinterpretations have been published. See, forexample, David Gordon White’s studies of Tantrism, notablyKiss of the Yogini;JosephS. Alter’s works on yoga, notablyYoga in Modern India; and Donald J. Lopez’s reconsid-erations of Tibetan Buddhism, notablyBuddhism and Science.4)Aurobindo,Autobiographical Notes, ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –Whatever its source, Aurobindo’s knowledge definitely went beyond thingsfound in Indian texts. The most obvious example of this is his knowledgeof the theory of evolution. His own concept of spiritual evolution, a centralpart of his philosophy, cannot be traced to any Indian source. He at timessuggested that the idea of evolution had been adumbrated in certain texts ofthe Sankhya and Tantric traditions, but he also acknowledged the Europeanorigin of the modern theory. As a classical scholar, he had little knowledge ofmodern science, but he did not have to readThe Origin of Speciesto be exposedto the idea of evolution in England during the s and s.There are other concepts in Aurobindo’s philosophy that have no clearequivalents in the Indian tradition. Some of them—the importance of theindividual, for example—can be traced back to his English education. Othersseem like glacial erratics that have been deposited in the field of his thoughtfrom remote sources. In what follows I will show that some such ideas may havecome to him from Lurianic kabbalah by way of the Mouvement Cosmique,an early-twentieth-century esoteric group based in France and Algeria. Thelink between Aurobindo and this group was Mirra Alfassa (–), aFrenchwoman of Sephardic Jewish extraction who met him in India in and later became his chief collaborator.. The Hermetic Brotherhood of LuxorMirra Alfassa was an active memberof the MouvementCosmique from around to . During this period she came into close contact with the leader ofthe movement, Max Theon (birth name Louis Maxmillian Bimstein, (?–), and his wife, an Englishwoman whose name at birth was probably MaryChrystine Woodroffe Ware (?–). These two had met in Englandaround  when both were significant figures in the British esoteric scene,Woodroffe Ware as the founder of the Universal Philosophic Society, Theon asone of the founders of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, generally referredto as the H.B. of L. Since the H.B. of L. can be viewed retrospectively as apredecessor of the Mouvement Cosmique, and because the H.B. of L., nowlittle known, is of some interest in the history of esotericism in late-nineteenth-century England, I will briefly survey its development and teachings beforegoing on to the Mouvement Cosmique, Alfassa, and Aurobindo.The second half of the nineteenth century was a time of great interest invarious forms of esoteric practice and lore in Europe and the United States.The modern spiritualist movement may be said to have begun with the table-rapping heard in Hydesville, New York, in . In the years that followed,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –people from all walks of life tried their hand at spirit-communication. Manywent to séances for an evening’s amusement, but others were serious seekers oftruths that had till then been regarded as the prerogative of religion. Dozensof groups were formed that claimed to be modern representatives of ancientand mediaeval esoteric traditions: Egyptian, kabbalistic, Hermetic, Masonic,Rosicrucian, Indian. The most successful of these was the Theosophical Society,founded in New York in . Its leading figure, H.P. Blavatsky, disdainedcommerce with spirits, claiming instead to be in touch withmahatmasorAdepts who directed the spiritual evolution of the universe.5In  a hitherto unknown occult society announced its existence inEngland: the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. Neophytes learned that thegroup was only apparently new. In a letter of , one of the group’s founders,Peter Davidson (–), revealed that its inner circle had been ‘formedinto a distinct and Hermetic order in consequence of a division that took placein the ranks of the Hermetic Initiates  years prior to the year  of ourpresent era’.6More historically, the H.B. of L. was presented as an outgrowthof the Brotherhood of Luxor, a group mentioned by Blavatsky inIsis Unveiled().7This was disputed by the Theosophists, one of whom wrote that ‘thegudgeon-trap called “The H.B. of L.”’ had simply ‘pilfered’ the name.8The H.B. of L. presented itself as an order of practical occultism. Its use ofmystical techniques to open the way to inner experience was something of anovelty at the time. Most esoteric groups, including the Theosophical Society,were content simply to disseminate secret doctrines. The practical techniquesof the H.B. of L. consisted mainly of rituals of sacred sexuality and the useof “magic mirrors”. It is not known how effective these techniques were, butthe popularity of the practical approach encouraged the Theosophical Societyto open its own “esoteric section” in . By that time the H.B. of L. hadceased to operate in England. It transpired in  that one of its founders, aman who calledhimself Thomas Burgoyne (birthname Thomas Henry Dalton,–) had been convicted of advertising fraud in Leeds.9Threatenedwith exposure, Burgoyne and Davidson left for the United States, where theykept the H.B. of L. and related groups afloat for several years.5)Godwin,Theosophical Enlightenment, –.6)Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, .7)Passage reproduced and discussed in Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, .8)H.

This was Theon, the group’s primaryinstructor in practical occultism. If one is to go by his marriage certificate,10Theon’s real name was Louis Maxmillian Bimstein, his father’s name Judes LionBimstein, and his father’s profession rabbi. The same document gives his agein  as thirty; other documents would make him six or seven years older.All accounts agree that he came from Poland, Russia or the Ukraine and thathe was of Jewish origin. It is generally assumed that he was exposed to thekabbalah or a form of Hasidism influenced by the kabbalah during his youth.This is not implausible. Poland became a centre of kabbalistic study in the latesixteenth century and remained one until well into the nineteenth.11Hasidismrose in the same region in the eighteenth century and flourished there until theHolocaust.Theon left eastern Europe sometime around , settling first in Parisand then in London. Little is known of his early activities. A cryptic accountwritten by Davidson says: ‘In  (and not , as the January number oftheTheosophistsays), an adept of the serene, ever-existent and ancient Orderof the original H.B. of L. ... resolved to choose a neophyte in Great Britainwho would answer to his intentions’. In  the ‘adept’ found the man he waslooking for, ‘and after having truly tested him and had the authenticity of hiscredentials verified, he gradually instructed the neophyte’.12Joscelyn Godwin,Christian Chanel and John P. Deveney, the historians of the H.B. of L., arguethat the neophyte in question was Theon. It certainly was to him that aspirantswere directed to write when the H.B. of L. first advertised itself in :Students of the Occult Science, searchers after truth and Theosophists who may havebeen disappointed in their expectations of sublime wisdom being freely dispensedby HINDOO MAHATMAS ... can be admitted, after a short probationary term,as members of an Occult Brotherhood, who do not boast of their knowledge andattainments, but teach freely and without reserve all they find worthy to receive.N.B.

Her name,going again by the marriage certificate,was Mary Chrystine Woodroffe Ware.14At this time she was lecturing under the name of Una, which, as readers ofSpenser will recall, is the name of the heroine of the first book of theFaerieQueene. (In the poem Una, “One”, symbolises Truth.) Una was the founder ofthe Universal Philosophic Society, whose purpose, as she wrote in the group’sprospectus, was ‘to create or form a Temple of Truth in which Science as theHigh Priest shall offer to humanity the three-fold gifts of happiness, Holinessand Freedom’. The prospectus sets forth three objects, seven laws, and nineprimary axioms. The seventh axiom, ‘That man is ever evolving and that thecomprehension of electricity and its great collaborateur magnetism marks amost important epoch in his evolution’,15showstheSociety’skinshipwithother late-nineteenth-century organisations attempting to harmonise scienceand spirituality. Also in , theSayings of the Sibyl Alta Una,byUna,HighPriestess of Pan, the Light God and Eros, was brought out. Its style, in contrastto that of the other pamphlet, was not philosophical or scientific but mantic:‘Nine times I have lived upon the earth (consciously) that I might attract,concentrate, and diffuse Life, Light and Love, the life of Pan, the Light ofthe Light King and the Love of Eros the immortal’.16Una kept something ofthis tone even while addressing the Universal Philosophic Society, appealing,as a contemporary observer wrote, ‘to inspired intuition—no trace of dry andharsh ratiocination’.17Shortly after her marriage, Una stopped addressing meetings and began toappear with Theon at séances. He was active in the H.B. of L. and also adver-tised himself as a healer.18Duringits brief momentin the sun (–),theH.B. of L. was regarded by some as a serious rival of the Theosophical Society.The revelation of Burgoyne’s criminal past enabled the Theosophists to dismiss14)Her death certificate gives her name as ‘Miriam Lin Woodroff, femme de Max Théon’.Writers of secondary sources often refer to her as Alma Theon. Alma was a pseudonym givento her in a book written by the wife of Louis Thémanlys, Theon’s disciple and successor, andthere is no evidence she ever used it.

But the teachings the two of them developed after thedemise of the H.B. of L. had a depth and sophistication far surpassing those ofthe earlier group, and these teachings had an influence that is still felt a centurylater.. Le Mouvement CosmiqueAfter remaining in France for a year and a half, Theon and his wife went toAlgeria and settled in the town of Tlemcen. Here, in a villa at the foot ofthe Atlas mountains, they spent a decade developing their teachings. MmeTheon wrote ceaselessly, giving expression to a personal mythology that wouldconstitute the bulk of the couple’s literary output. Theon remained in touchwith the European esoteric scene and occasionally published an article inFrench journals. His most important correspondent was F.-Ch. Barlet (birthname Albert Faucheux, –), a significant figure in the French occultrevival. Barlet was a founder-member of the Paris branch of the TheosophicalSociety, and is also regarded as ‘the father of the modern astrological movementin France’.20An early member and supporter of the H.B. of L., Barlet retainedhis admiration for the organisation’s instructor in practical occultism even afterits dissolution. In  Barlet paid a visit to the Theons in Tlemcen; thenext year, in Paris, he launchedLa revue cosmiquein order to bring about thephilosophical synthesis he long had dreamed of. The main contributors to thisjournal were Theon and his wife.21The Philosophie Cosmique was elaborated over more than a decade inLarevue cosmique, another periodical calledLa tradition cosmique,andvarioussubsidiary publications. Any attempt to summarise the teachings in a fewparagraphs is bound to be inadequate.An added difficulty is that the texts19)The Theosophist, June , reproduced in Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, .20)Ellic Howe, quoted in Chanel,Théon, .21)Chanel,Théon, –, ; Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, , , ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –of the movement are forbidding to the non-initiate. A reviewer in theMercurede Francecommented in  that the group’s teachings were ‘set forth inan obscure language, bristling with barbarisms likesentientation,responsion,pathotisme,whose coinage was unnecessaryas proper Frenchequivalentsalmostalways exist’.22A half-century later, a scholar noted that the teachings ofLa tradition cosmiquewere‘writteninsuchabizarremannerthateventhemost cultivated men (unless of course they were themselves “Cosmic”) quicklyabandoned the attempt to read them’.23I have relied on other primary textsto get at the main points of doctrine. The ‘Base de la Philosophie Cosmique’,an official publication of the movement, sums up the teachings in eighteenaxioms. I translate those germane to the present discussion, allowing mostneologisms to stand untranslated:I. The Causeless Cause alone has no form and consequently is above ourconceptions. It is the Unthinkable.II. The Formateurs of all states and all worlds, along with their inhabitants,are the work of the Procédants, of the Attributes, of their Emanations,and of their Formations ....IV. In the Physical State, man is the supreme Evolver [Evoluteur]....IX. All manifestation of the Unformed [l’Informal] is dual .... Duality ofbeing or thepathétiqueunion of the active and passive is thereforeessential for any evolution towards perfection.XIV. Life is sacred, because life is the means for theindividualisationofintelligence ....XVII. There are four classifications of terrestrial Formations: mineral, veg-etable, animal and psycho-intellectual or divine-human; among thesefour there is no division in the order.24These six axioms give the gist of the cosmology of the Philosophie Cosmique.It is elaborated most clearly in thePrincipes généraux de la philosophie cosmique,a -page booklet published in . I summarize the main points of doctrinehere:There is a Cause, which people visualise as an anthropomorphic God,creating out of nothing. This is absurd. In fact the Causeless Cause [la Causesans cause] is beyond all conception. We see only the manifested forces. These22)‘Revue de la quinzaine’, .23)Monestier,LesSociétéssecrètesféminines, .24)‘Basedelaphilosophiecosmique’,–."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –act on Integral Substanceto “form” (not “create”) beings and worlds. Substanceis not inert matter. Universal life animates everything from the crystal to themost ineffable manifestation of the Unthinkable.25Force and matter are one. The Cosmos is the vestment of the Unthinkable.The first result of the equality of Integral Substance and the manifested forcesis the Cosmic Equilibrium. For this to be, Integral Substance must be able toreceive the manifested forces and respond to them. If it cannot, there resultsdisequilibrium, which is the principle of division, and dissolution, which is theprinciple of death and the source of evil.26The manifested forces of the Unthinkable cannot act directly on IntegralSubstance. Certain intermediaries are needed: the Formateurs, who producethe world as we know it. There is no creation, only formation. The Formateurof our world, according to the Tradition, is calledthe Elohim, who acts througha subordinate Formation, the first Man. As the manifested forces, which bringabout cosmic Equilibrium, act through the Formateurs, so disequilibrium hasits agents: the Grand Hostile and the Hostiles. These agents of division arethe enemies of Man. The story of Man’s struggle against them is told in thenarratives of the Tradition, for instanceGenesis. The so-called fall of man willbe followed by his triumph: his reascension, by means of evolution, to integralImmortality. This is the goal: the Restitution of Man to his full rights andpower.27Following the example of the founders of the H.B. of L. (and of manyother spiritual teachers across the ages), the Theons did not put forward thePhilosophie Cosmique as something novel. ‘Yet another new philosophy?’opens thePrincipes généraux. ‘Certainly not. It is as old as the World’. In fact:It is the original Tradition of Humanity, the pure source, from which all religions, allphilosophies, have borrowed the light that they reflect—after altering it more or less,the better to adapt it to their interests or conceptions. It is the universal Tradition, ofall times and all worlds. Therefore is it calledCosmic.28Despite this claim, the pedigree of the Philosophie Cosmique can be tracedwith some accuracy. It owes a great deal to Una. Several of itsAxiomsecho the“Nine Primary Axioms” of her Universal Philosophic Society, and the personal25)Principes généraux,–.26)Principes généraux, –.27)Principes généraux, –.

Theon’s stamp, equally clear, was highlighted by Barlet, whoregarded the Mouvement Cosmique as the direct successor of the H.B. of L.He wrote in  that the early group, had ‘ceased in order to pass on thesuccession to anotherperfectlyvital form’.29But it was another sort of influencethat struck most of Theon’s contemporaries. TheMercure de Francerevieweralready cited wrote in  that, as far as he could determine, Theon’s missionwasto reveal to the world the teachings of the oral tradition, lost for Occidentals, of thekabbalah in its original purity, that is to say, freed from of the errors and the childish,profane stories contained in theZohar, restored at last to its integrality and true originalmeaning.30Otherswho noticedthis ancestryweremore troubledby it. A critic inNouveauxhorizons de la science et de la penséespoke of theTradition cosmiqueas a ‘mélangeof oriental systems coloured by Judaism’.31Barlet himself wrote to the Theonsin  that a doctrine ‘whose intimate affinity with Judaism was evident’,combined with theRevue’sapparently anti-Christian tone, would be enoughto get the movement suppressed.32His fears were not without basis. In the hysteria surrounding the Dreyfus affair was still intense. Barlet ultimatelybroke with Theon over this issue, and Theon became editor of theRevue.I summarise the subsequent history of the Mouvement Cosmique verybriefly with special reference to developments related to the subject of thispaper. After Barlet’s departure, Louis Thémanlys (birth name Louis Moyse,–) became head of the Paris centre. In  or  Thémanlyswas introduced to Mirra Alfassa, the sister of one of his friends. Of Jewishdescent but unreligious,33Alfassa had a strong turn towards the spiritual life,and responded immediately to what Thémanlys told her about the Theons’teachings. She soon becameinvolved in the movement’sactivities, participatingin a discussion group and helping to edit theRevue.ShemayhavemetTheoninFrance in , and she certainly made two voyages to Algeria to be with him29)Barlet inL’étoile de l’Orient,  March , quoted in English in Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, .30)“Revue de la quinzaine”, .31)F.

Theon lapsed into depression and lost interest in the movement.The last issue of theRevueappeared at the end of . Theon returned toTlemcen, where he died in . Even during his lifetime, the direction of theMouvement Cosmique passed into the hands of Louis Thémanlys, who for ashort time published a sequel to theRevueentitledLe mouvement cosmique.Louis’s son Pascal, who succeeded him, emigrated to Jerusalem in . Herehe created a small centre that is still active.34. Theon and the Hebraic TraditionTheon never denied his Jewish roots; neither did he go out of his way to exposethem. According to a story current even during his lifetime, he was chosen byan Eastern (kabbalistic? Hasidic?) master to transmit the Tradition to Westernaspirants in a way appropriate to the place and time.35Henceheavoidedcastinghis teachings in an explicitly kabbalistic form. For this or for other reasons, theRevuecontains few allusions to the kabbalah, though Hebrew terminology andthemes (“Elohim”, the legends ofGenesis) are not uncommon.This lack of an explicit Hebraic base is consistent with the founders’ claimthat the Philosophie Cosmique predated any historic tradition, but was, quitesimply, the original esoteric tradition of humanity. The two traditions thoughtby occultists of that period to be the oldest and most remarkable, the “Aryan”and the “Chaldean”, were said by the Theons to be early deformations of theoriginal tradition. They nevertheless conceded that they had ‘borrowed aboveall from the oral Chaldean tradition’.36This was an indirect way of saying thattheyborrowed primarily from theHebraic tradition, in particularthekabbalah.34)In  I met Pascal Thémanlys in Jerusalem and sat with a small circle associated withhim there. Thémanlys died in . At present the Argaman Center of Jerusalem publishesand distributes books by and about Theon (http://abpw.net/cosmique/livres/listeang.htm).In October  I sent an email to their address asking for information about currentactivities, but did not receive a reply.35)“Revue de la quinzaine”, ; Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, .36)Revue cosmique: , .

Enormously influential in the Hebraic world, ithas also beenimportant in Christian esoteric circles since the sixteenthcentury.Traced back by some as far as the Bible itself, the kabbalah as we know it had itsfirst flowering in Provence and Spain in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.It was at this time that theZohar, the most important kabbalistic text, waswritten. After the Spanish expulsion (), the kabbalah was disseminatedthroughout the Jewish world. From the latter part of the sixteenth century, theschool associated with the name of the Palestinian Isaac Luria (–)became the dominant form. Lurianic kabbalah soon reached Poland, whichbecame an important centre of its cultivation. Popular movements active inthe region in the seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries—the Shabbetian and Frankist heresies and Hasidism—all contain elements ofLurianic kabbalah.37So does the Philosophie Cosmique.Before proceeding, I will provide a summary of some important kabbalisticdoctrines, touching lightly or even ignoring some of its better known aspectswhile stressing those that resurfaced later in the Philosophie Cosmique. Thecentral problem of kabbalistic cosmology, indeed of all esoteric cosmology,is the relationship between the One and the Many. The great question is:How does the infinite and perfect create or manifest this finite, imperfectuniverse? The three most characteristic doctrines of Lurianic kabbalah:tsim-tsum(contraction),shevirat ha-kelim(the breaking of the vessels), andtikkuntradition. Nineteenth-century Frenchmen used the word “Chaldean” rather vaguely. Frenchtranslators of theZohar(written in Aramaic in thirteenth-century Spain) wrote that theirversions were rendered “from the Chaldean”. Theon seems to have profited from suchimprecision. By saying that the Philosophie Cosmique derived from the Chaldean traditionhe gave it a respectable extraction while avoiding a terminology that might have identifiedhim too closely with the Judaic tradition. But the Judaic tradition was certainly his maintextual source. Christian Chanel, whose work on Theon is the most extensive scholarly studyof the man, writes, in regard to a Cosmique publication: ‘one should understand by theChaldean tradition the Hebraic tradition’ (Chanel,Theon, ). Theon’s present followers,most of whom live in Israel, speak of him openly as belonging to the Hebraic tradition. Abook published in Jerusalemin refersto him as ‘agreat Kabbalist’ who ‘devoted himselfto the study and teaching of theSefer Bereshith[The Book of Genesis] and of the preceptsgiventoNoah’(IntroductiontoTheon,Sixth Cosmic Era, ). Others view such statementsas attempts to give the Mouvement Cosmique and Theon ‘retrospectively a Hasidic [orkabbalistic] origin’ (H. B. of L.: Textes et documents, xxix). They certainly make Theon moreexplicitly kabbalistic than he wished to appear.37)Scholem,Kabbalah, –; Scholem,Major Trends, ."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –(restitution), deal with the process of manifestation in more detail than earlierkabbalah did. In brief, the Lurianic account runs as follows.38The infinity ofGod leaves no room for a cosmos. Before God can emanate God’s attributes,a contraction or limitation, that yet is not a limitation, must be introducedinto God’s nature. This istsimtsum. The first being to be emanated in theprimal space created bytsimtsumis Adam Kadmon, the primeval man. Fromhim radiate the tensefirot, the divine attributes or emanations. With them areassociated vessels to hold the radiated light. But the vessels of the lowersefirotcannot contain the light; they break open, spilling the light and scatteringtheir shards. These are the source of gross matter. This “breaking of the vessels”(shevirat ha-kelim) releases ‘the whole complexity of the cosmological drama’.39But this drama will have a happy ending. Light issuing from the foreheadof Adam Kadmon will restore the confused creation to its original design.This istikkun(restoration, restitution). And because the manifestation haspassed through the cosmic process, the restored harmony will be greater thanit would otherwise have been. The attainment oftikkunis the purpose ofcreation.. Kabbalistic Themes in the Philosophie CosmiqueThe termrestitutionoccurs frequently in theRevue cosmique, indeed the journalclaimed to be the ‘Restitution of the Original Tradition’. In thePrincipesgénéraux, restitution is explained as follows: When, as a result of the cosmicdisequilibrium, Man is deprived of his birthright by the Hostiles, the processof evolution begins. In the course of its progression, the Great Hostile willbe defeated and man will be restored to his union with his Divine Origin.‘This will be the dawn of Restitution, the Restitution of Man to his rightsand power, the Restitution of the Earth to its splendours and capacities’.40This‘Restitution’ clearly is the same astikkun, the fable of the breaking of the vesselsbeing replaced by a typically nineteenth-century narrative of evolutionaryprogress.Restitution is one of several points of Cosmique doctrine that derive fromLurianic kabbalah. I will examine three others that are especially relevant tothe present discussion, numbering them for easy reference.38)Scholem,Kabbalah, –; Scholem,Major Trends, –.39)Scholem,Major Trends, .40)Principes généraux, ."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –a.Unity and DualityIn the kabbalah the original Unity is sometimes imaged as a union of Two.This is expressed by a number of concepts, such as the union of God with hisshekhinah, the female divine presence, anddu-parzufim,the‘double-facetednature of primeval man’.41The Philosophie Cosmique madedualité d’êtreoneof its central ideas: ‘All manifestation of the Unthinkable is dual: Force andSubstance, action and resistance. It is by the opposition and conjunction ofthese two poles that all things are manifested’.42Thisisastrueofindividualsacting on earth as of the cosmic processes of evolution: ‘without human duality,there could not be fullresponsionto the Divine Duality’.43The union of com-plementary male-female couples was a common theme in nineteenth-centuryoccultism. Often, as in the H.B. of L., it was given a sexual turn. The Mouve-ment Cosmique played down the sexual aspect, but stressed the importance offinding one’s counterpart. More than seventy years after theRevueceased pub-lication, a French follower of the Theons wrote: ‘This [Cosmique] work wasdone [by Mme Theon] in duality [en dualité] with Max Theon, as no missionof this sort can be accomplished properly without this duality of the couple’.44b.The Human Being, the Soul, and IndividualityIn theZoharand other early kabbalistic texts, ‘man is the perfecting agent ofthe cosmos’, for man has as his mission to ‘bring about atikkunor restora-tion of this world’. In early kabbalah, man’s soul is said to be threefold, com-prisingnefesh, the animal soul,ru\"ah, the spirit, andneshamah, the innermostsoul.Neshamahis like ‘a divine spark in man ... emanated directly from theGodhead’. Lurianic kabbalah speaks of a five-part soul, and also of thezelem(image), which is ‘the principle of individuality with which every single humanbeing is endowed’. Thezelem‘grows and develops in accordance with the bio-logical processes of its possessor’.4541)For theshekhinah,seeScholem,Mystical Shape, –.Fordu-parzufim, see Idel,NewPerspectives, –.42)Principes généraux, .43)Revue cosmiqueII: , .Responsionis a Cosmique coinage meaning something likeresponse or responsiveness.44)Fernande Boissay, personal communication to Jayantilal Parekh, Sri Aurobindo AshramArchives,  October .45)Scholem,Kabbalah, –; Scholem (ed.),Zohar,(ZoharII. b)."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –Similar ideas have an important place in the Philosophie Cosmique. Accord-ing to thePrincipes généraux, restitution will come about when man (l’homme)defeats “the Hostile”, the power of falsehood. After his inevitable triumph,man ‘will become one with his Divine Origin, and will manifest its Light’.46The soul of man, which is nothing but ‘the light of our Divine Origin’, canbecome immortal ‘if we know how to individualize it’. Man has a fourfoldconstitution, comprising physical, nervous, psychic and mental degrees, eachof which has the power to develop itself to such an extent that it becomesindividualized. ‘If a man has, during his lifetime, sufficiently developed hispsychic and above all his mental individuality, these superior elements con-tinue to live, in other conditions of density, and the human personality sur-vives’.47c.The Body of LightIn the Philosophie Cosmique, the finalrestitutionwill not be complete unless itincludes the ‘physical degree’, that is, the body. According to thePrincipes,‘thereal physical body, that which belonged to the first man when he left the handsof his Formateur, had an envelope that was lightweight, elastic, luminous, andresistant. It was the body described in certain documents as the Body of Light[corps glorieux]’.48The ‘documents’ referred to here were probably kabbalistic.In Lurianic kabbalah, Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, is ‘nothing but afirst configuration of the divine light which flows from the essence of theEin-sofinto the primeval space of theTsimtsum’.49Other Hebraic texts speak ofAdam (sometimes also of Eve) as ‘having an outer skin of light’ or wearing‘garments of light’, and of having been ‘stripped of their garments of glory’when exiled from Eden.50. The Philosophie Cosmique and the Integral Yoga of Sri AurobindoIn the first section I spoke briefly of the Indian philosopher and yogi SriAurobindo. After completing his education in England, Aurobindo returnedto his homeland and found work in Baroda, a state in Western India. Here46)Principes généraux, –.47)Principes généraux, –.

His manuscripts of the period bear out in abundant detailthe statement, quoted above,51that his philosophy was based on theBhagavadGita,theUpanishads, and other Indian texts. From the beginning, virtually allthe philosophic themes he developed were Vedantic, deriving either from theUpanishadsor from the tradition that the philosopher Stephen Phillips calls“folk Vedanta”.52Aurobindo also affirmed that his philosophy was informedby the knowledge that came to him through inner experience; but as thisexperience was on Vedantic lines, it may be stated without hesitation thatAurobindo’s philosophy was based on Vedanta. Its other major componentwas ideas that he acquired during his European education and upbringing, inparticular the idea of evolution. Other less important sources could be cited; itis beyond thescope of this paper to surveythemall.Thetask weset for ourselveswas to see whether Aurobindo was influenced by the Philosophie Cosmiqueand, more remotely, by the kabbalah, as a result of his collaboration with MirraAlfassa. The ground has now been sufficiently well prepared for a discussion ofthis question.After leaving the Mouvement Cosmique in , Mirra remained active inthe Parisian spiritual-occult milieu. In March  she and her then husbandPaul Richard went to India and met Aurobindo. Four months later, they beganto publish a philosophical journal calledArya.Most of its contents werewrittenby Aurobindo. In February  the Richards were obliged to return to Francebecause of the First World War. Aurobindo continued to publish materialin theAryafor the next six years. His contributions comprised works onmetaphysics, yoga, textualexegesis, sociology, political science, cultural studies,and literary criticism, which later were republished as eight full-length booksand several shorter ones. The system of thought presented in these works isknown as the Integral Yoga.51)See footnote .52)Vedanta, one of the six orthodox schools of Indian philosophy, may be described brieflyas the philosophy of the Upanishads. Classical Vedanta is highly technical, deriving fromcommentaries on the texts written by mediaeval writers. “Folk Vedanta”, according toPhillips, is ‘a tradition of spiritual practice continuous with the authors of the Upanishads,a tradition that has often associated itself withclassical Vedanta of one or another stripe butthat often has been aloof from mainstream philosophy, expressing itself in poetry, sermons,etc. and in the modern period often becoming eclectic (à la Ramakrishna and Vivekananda)’(personal communication to author,  June ). For a more technical discussion, seePhillips,Philosophy of Brahman, , –, –."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –After passing the war years in France and Japan, Mirra and Paul Richardreturned to India in . Paul continued on to France; Mirra remained withAurobindo as one of his disciples. Six years later, Aurobindo announced thatshe was his spiritual equal, and put her in charge of the ashram that had grownup around him. At this time he gave her the name “the Mother”. As all herworks are published under this name or its French equivalent, I will refer toher as the Mother from this point on.Aurobindo had no knowledge of the Philosophie Cosmique before meetingthe Mother. What he learned of it came primarily from discussions with her,and these discussions were not academic. There is no evidence that she evertried to give him a full account of Theon’s thought, and she did not necessarilytell him that a given piece of knowledge that she passed on to him had come toher from Theon or Mme Theon. As is the case with most mystics and occultists,she had little interest in the provenance of the ideas that she accepted as true.It was enough for her if she was able to confirm their truth through her innervision or experience. It is certain however that she told Aurobindo that certainterms that she used were partsoftheTheons’vocabulary.If Aurobindo knew little about the Philosophie Cosmique, he knew virtu-ally nothing about the kabbalah. Around  an Englishman practising yogaunder his guidance sent him a diagram of the tensefirot, asking him whetherit corresponded to anything in Aurobindo’s philosophy. Aurobindo gave noindication of recognising the diagram, but he did write an interesting com-ment about parallels between different systems of spiritual and occult knowl-edge:I do not think exact correlations can always be traced between one system of spiritualand occult knowledge and another. All deal with the same material, but there aredifferences of standpoint, differences of view-range, a divergence in the mental idea ofwhat is seen and experienced, disparate pragmatic purposes and therefore a differencein the paths surveyed, cut out or followed;the systems vary, each constructs its ownschema and technique.53Borrowing Aurobindo’s language,onemightsay thatthekabbalah,thePhiloso-phie Cosmique, and Aurobindo’s IntegralYoga presentsome of ‘the same mate-rial’ in different ways. There are, as I showed in section , many similaritiesbetween elements of Lurianic kabbalah and the Philosophie Cosmique. There53)Aurobindo,Letters, ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –are also some similarities between the Philosophie Cosmique and the IntegralYoga, as well as a few similarities between Lurianic kabbalah and the IntegralYoga that are not shared by the Philosophie Cosmique. I will examine thesecorrelations in this section and the next.The most obvious resemblances between the Philosophie Cosmique andthe Integral Yoga are the least significant. The first sentence of the ‘Base dela philosophie cosmique’ (circa ) is: ‘Le Mouvement Cosmique est pure-ment philosophique’.54The motto of the French edition of theArya() is‘La revue “Arya” est purement philosophique’. In a similar case of direct bor-rowing, in  the Mother took the symbol of the Mouvement Cosmique—ahexagram enclosing a square with a lotus floating on water inside—and madeit the symbol of Sri Aurobindo. Such similarities are conspicuous but philo-sophically insignificant. More relevant to the present inquiry are similaritiesof terminology and concept. I will examine three examples that are related tothose I discussed above when looking at links between the kabbalah and thePhilosophie Cosmique.a.The Two-in-OneAs noted in section a,dualité d’être, an important concept in the PhilosophieCosmique, is foreshadowed in Lurianic kabbalah in the idea of God’s unionwith hisshekhinah, and in the double-faceted nature of the primeval man,du-parzufim. In fact the idea of a male-female duality at the root of creation is arecurrentthemein the occult cosmologies of many cultures.In India it is foundin Sankhya philosophy as the duality of soul (purusha, which is masculine) andnature (prakriti, which is feminine). Tantra philosophy speaks of the dualityof the Lord (ishwara, masculine) and his creative energy (shakti, feminine).The androgynousardhanarishwaraimage in Shaivite iconography gives strikingvisual form to this idea. Aurobindo referred to all these concepts in his writings,but he sometimes spoke of the idea of the divine Duality or “Two-in-One” insuch a way as to suggest not Sankhya or Tantra, but the Philosophie Cosmique.In his epic poemSavitrihe wrote:Descend to life with him thy heart desires.OSatyavan,OluminousSavitri,Isentyouforthofoldbeneaththestars,54)‘Basedelaphilosophiecosmique’,."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –A dual power of God in an ignorant world,In a hedged creation shut from limitless self,Bringing down God to the insentient globe,Lifting earth-beings to immortality.55Moving from literature to life, Aurobindo felt that he and the Mother werean embodied ‘dual power of God’. In a letter of , he told a disciple: ‘theMother’s consciousness and mine are the same, the one Divine Consciousnessin two, because that is necessary for the play’.56This statement and the passagefromSavitriboth contain an idea of individual soul-complementarity that isvery similar to the idea ofdualité d’êtrein the Philosophie Cosmique.b.The Psychic BeingTheon once wrote that a humandualitébecomes dynamic by the ‘infusionof the active psychic being into the passive psychic being’.57In Cosmiquetexts, the term psychic is related to the soul, not to the supernormal; butthe ‘psychic degree, or soul’ is conceived of as the ‘organ of the emotiveand affective sentiments’.58This affective soul plays an important role in theindividual’s evolution, as explained in a passage already quoted: ‘If a man has,during his lifetime, sufficiently developed his psychic and above all his mentalindividuality, these superior elements continue to live, in other conditions ofdensity, and the human personality survives’.59Some of the same terms and ideas are found, differently arranged, in theIntegral Yoga. Aurobindo’s concept of the soul is very complex. It is basedon the fundamental Upanishadic idea of theatmanor “self”, which is onewith thebrahmanor Absolute. It also includes the later Vedantic idea of thejivatmanor individual self.60But the most distinctive part of Aurobindo’s soul-concept is the psychic being or evolutionary soul, a term which does not55)Aurobindo,Savitri, . Cf. in the same work: ‘The Two who are one are the secret ofall power’ (), ‘The figure of the deathless Two-in-One’ (), ‘A dual Nature covered theUnique’ (), and ‘The incarnate dual Power shall open God’s door’ ().56)Aurobindo,On Himself, .57)Theon, article of  quoted in English in Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, .58)Principes généraux, .59)Principes généraux, .

The first of these was ‘the spark of the Divine involved herein the individual existence.’ This psychic entity ‘grows and evolves in the formof the psychic being’. As it moves from life to life, the individual soul gainsstrength whenever there is ‘a higher movement in us’. Over the course of manylives, ‘by the accumulation of these deeper and higher movements’, a psychicindividuality or psychic being takes form. It is this ‘soul-person, the psychicbeing, that survives and carries mind and life with it on its [evolutionary]journey’.62Aurobindo’s ideas about the psychic being were certainly influenced bythe Mother, and the Mother certainly got some of her ideas from Theon.She explained in  that Theon distinguished between thecentre divinandtheêtre psychique, adding that these terms were part of ‘the vocabulary ofTheon that I brought’ when she came to India.63Theon’scentre divineandêtre psychiquecorrespond in many respects to Aurobindo’s psychic entity andpsychic being.c.Physical PerfectionThecorps glorieux, an important Cosmique concept, has no exact equivalentin the Indian tradition.64Aurobindo mentioned thecorps glorieuxby namein a few letters to his disciples, explaining that something of the sort mightform part of the physical transformation that would be one of the results of61)After Aurobindo incorporated the term “psychic being” in his philosophy, he and hisdisciples looked for a corresponding term in Sanskrit texts and dictionaries, and found oneinchaitya purusha(Aurobindo,Letters, ). This phrase does not occur in theUpanishads,Bhagavad GitaorRig Veda, but rather in some mediaeval texts of secondary importance thathad no influence on Aurobindo during his formative years, if indeed he read them at all.When a disciple pointed out that he could not find anything corresponding to the psychicbeing or psychic evolution in theBhagavad Gita, Aurobindo replied: ‘These things are not inthe Gita, but we cannot limit our knowledge by the points in the Gita’ (Aurobindo,Letters,).62)Aurobindo,Letters, –, ; Aurobindo,Life Divine, .63)La Mère,L’agenda, –.64)There are similar ideas in several Eastern traditions, for example in thesiddhateachingsof Ramalinga Swamigal (Thulasiram,Arut Perum Jothi), and certain forms of TibetanBuddhism (Sogyal Rimpoche,Tibetan Book, , ), but the body of light in thesetraditions does not correspond in many important respects to thecorps glorieuxof Theon."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –the “descent of the supermind”, a spiritual process of considerable importancein his method of yoga. In these letters he attributed the idea of thecorpsglorieuxto Theon. This would make it appear that his use of the conceptwas derivative. Interestingly, however, his ideas on the subject were close toTheon’s even before he knew anything about the Philosophie Cosmique. In anearly writing not published during his lifetime, Aurobindo gave the elementsof physical perfection (sharirasiddhi) as health, lightness, beauty (in particular,luminosity), and corporeal delight (which consists in the ability to assimilateevery sort of contact).65These four elements have a remarkable similarity to thefour attributes of thecorps glorieuxas listed in thePrincipes générauxand otherCosmique writings: resistance to disease, lightness, luminosity, and elasticity.66. Parallels between the Kabbalah and the Integral YogaAs mentioned above, Aurobindo had no direct knowledge of the kabbalah; butthere are a number of elements in his philosophy that are similar to ideas inLurianic kabbalah. Some of these parallels may result, at least in part, fromhis indirect knowledge of the teachings of Theon. When Aurobindo spokeof physical perfection, he referred to Theon’scorps glorieux.Inspeakingofthecorps glorieux, the author of thePrincipes généraux(writing on behalf of Theon)referred to ‘certain documents’, almost certainly kabbalistic, that spoke of abody of light. It follows that Aurobindo may have been influenced indirectlybythekabbalahwhenhespokeofabodyoflight.There are other parallels between Aurobindo’s philosophy and the kabbalahthat cannot be explained in this way, because there is nothing in the PhilosophyCosmique to provide a link between the kabbalistic teaching and Aurobindo’sphilosophy. In section , I spoke of the important kabbalistic concept oftsim-tsum. According to Gershom Scholem, this term meant originally ‘concentra-tion’ or ‘contraction’, but was used by Lurianic kabbalists to mean ‘withdrawal’or ‘retreat’. In brief,tsimtsumis the contraction or withdrawal of the Infinitethat makes space for the finite creation. By the act oftsimtsum,God‘makesitpossible for something which is notEin-softo exist’.67This doctrine, whichis at the base of the Lurianic theory of creation, finds no clear echo in the65)Aurobindo,Record of Yoga, . Aurobindo elaborated on each of these four elements inthe body ofRecord of Yoga.66)Principes généraux, .67)Scholem,Major Trends, ; Scholem,Kabbalah, ."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –Philosophie Cosmique. The account of creation in thePrincipeshighlights theability of the Causeless Cause to produce division in Integral Substance, but itdoes not speak of concentration or contraction.68One of the most distinctive aspects of Aurobindo’s cosmology is ‘exclusiveconcentration of consciousness-force’, a concept that he developed in a chap-ter ofThe Life Divine, his major work of philosophy. He begins by sayingthat ‘integral Brahman [the Absolute] cannot be in its integrality the sourceof the Ignorance [a technical term meaning “separative knowledge”, which isthe nature of the lower creation], because its integrality is in its very natureall-consciousness’. Ignorance can only come about ‘by some concentration ofconsciousness absorbed in a part knowledge’. After noting that human mindhas a power of exclusive concentration that serves certain pragmatic ends, hegoes on: ‘in the universal order of things, the inconscience of material Natureis the same exclusive concentration ... as in the self-limitation of the wakinghuman mind’. The purpose of this cosmic self-limitation or exclusive concen-tration ‘is to trace the cycle of self-oblivion and self-discovery for the joy ofwhich the Ignorance is assumed in Nature by the secret spirit’.69The similar-ity between Lurianictsimtsumand Aurobindonian exclusive concentration isremarkable.From the human point of view, Nature’s assumption of Ignorance for thesake of a joyful ‘self-oblivion and self-discovery’ is the responsibility and theprivilege of the psychic being. I have already noted that this concept, central toAurobindo’s explanation of the destiny of the individual, has some similarityto the concept of the soul in the Philosophie Cosmique. Both Theon andAurobindo used the termêtre psychiqueor psychic being, both spoke of itsimportance in the soul’s evolution. But in the Philosophie Cosmique, thesoul’sévolution(which often means simply “development”) is limited to asingle life, because Theon rejected reincarnation except in exceptional cases. InAurobindo, the process of individual evolution requires reincarnation, becausethe soul needs many lives to accumulate a sufficient number of deeper andhigher experiences to give form to a psychic being.Interestingly, Aurobindo’s ideas of soul development are closer to the corre-sponding ideas in the kabbalah, of which he knew nothing, than to those in68)Principes généraux, –.69)Aurobindo,Life Divine, , , . Compare the lines of poetry already quoted(footnote ): “In a hedged creation shut from limitless self,/Bringing down God to theinsentient globe ....”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –the Philosophie Cosmique, of which he had at least indirect knowledge. Kab-balah has a well developed conception of soul transmigration or reincarna-tion, which it callsgilgul, along with the concept of thezelem, a principleof individuality related to but distinct from the soul. Scholem, basing him-self on a thirteenth-century kabbalistic text, explains that thezelemdescendsinto the world in order to reach ‘a state of perfection which was not the casein the beginning before its descent’.70Compare this with a passage in whichAurobindo explains ‘the purpose and origin of the disharmony’ that charac-terizes the world: ‘Once manifestation began infinite possibility also began’and among the possibilities was a total negation of Light and Bliss. Once thispossibility has appeared, it ‘acquires for the Soul descending into evolution-ary manifestation an irresistible attraction which creates the inevitability [of itsoccurrence]—anattraction which in human termson theterrestrial levelmightbe interpreted as the call of the unknown, the joy of danger and difficulty andadventure, the will to attempt the impossible, to work out the incalculable,the will to create the new and the uncreated with one’s own self and life as thematerial’.71. Aurobindo, Theon, the Kabbalah, and the Concept of “Influence” in theHistory of IdeasIt is clear from the material presented in sections – that there are manysignificant correspondences between the teachings of Lurianic kabbalah, thePhilosophie Cosmique of Max Theon and his wife, and the Integral Yoga of SriAurobindo and the Mother. Whenever there are correspondences between twoor more bodies of thought, there exists a possibility that the correspondencesare due toinfluenceof one kindor another.In this section I willexamineseveraltypes of influence that may exist between thinkers or schools of thought andapply my findings to the bodies of thought I have studied in this paper.Influence is one of the most difficult of all concepts in the history of ideas.Postmodern thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida have triedto do away with it altogether, but historians still find it valid and useful.As Quentin Skinner says in a much-quoted paper, ‘there is no doubt thatthe concept of influence, while extremely elusive ... is far from being emptyof explanatory force’. He adds, however, that it is ‘easy to use the conceptin an apparently explanatory way without any consideration of whether the70)Scholem,Kabbalah, .71)Aurobindo,Letters, –."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –conditions sufficient, or at least necessary, for the proper application of theconcepthavebeenmet’.72I willnotenterintothedetails of Skinner’s argument,but will try to make some practical distinctions that may help in evaluatingwhether sufficient and necessary conditions are met in a given case.There are at least seven possible explanations for similarities betweenthe ideas of two different thinkers or schools of thought: () direct influence;() indirect influence; () separate descent from a common antecedent; ()independent response to prevailing conditions; () independent inspirationwithout reference to prevailing conditions; () a combination of two or moreof these factors; () sheer coincidence. For there to be direct influence, thenecessary condition is that thinker A must have been directly exposed to thethought of thinker B, as Porphyry was influenced by Plotinus. For there to beindirect influence, thinker A must have been exposed to the ideas of thinker Bthrough the intermediary of another thinker or body of thought, as Augustinewas influenced by Plato through the intermediary of Plotinus and other Neo-Platonist writers. For there to be separate descent from a common antecedent,thinkers A and B must have been independently exposed to a third thinkeror body of thought, know nothing of one another, but share some character-istics, as Pseudo-Dionysius and Abraham ibn Ezra share some Neo-platonicideas without the second knowing anything about the first. For there to beindependent response to prevailing conditions, thinker A and thinker B mustarrive at the same ideas without being in contact with each other, as Leibnizand Newton arrived independently at the infinitesimal calculus. For there tobe independent inspiration without reference to prevailing conditions, A andB, although belonging to completely different cultures, must arrive at the sameor similar concept, as Shankara and Mister Eckhardt formulated concepts ofthe One that are similar in some respects.I will now revisit the examples I have given in sections – with reference tothe possibilities sketched in the previous paragraph. In section  I pointed outthe close correspondence between the concept oftikkunin Lurianic kabbalahand the concept ofrestitutionin the Philosophie Cosmique. In formulatinghis theory ofrestitution, Theon was indirectly or perhaps directly influencedby kabbalistic writers. (It is impossible to say for sure whether there was anydirect influence from Lurianic texts, because nothing is known about Theon’sreading.) There is a strong correlation between the aspects of the kabbalisticideas ofshekhinahanddu-parzufimand the Cosmique idea ofdualité d’être.72)Skinner, ‘Meaning and Understanding’, ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –It is probable that this was due in part to indirect or direct influence fromkabbalistic sources; but Theon’s concept may also have been an independentresponse to the ideas of soul-kinship current in esoteric circles at the time,and it certainly was given specific form as a result of his own experiences withhis spiritual partner. Theon’s ideas of the soul and the psychic individual wereprobably influenced by kabbalistic ideas, but if so they certainly were modifiedby other ideas and by his own experiences. Theon acknowledged having foundthe idea of thecorps glorieuxin ‘certain [presumably kabbalistic] documents’,but he may have relied on his own inner vision or experience in giving his ideaaspecificform.Theon’s idea ofdualité d’êtrewas certainly known to the Mother, and shemay have passed something of what she knew along to Aurobindo. Thus inthis matter Aurobindo may have been indirectly influenced by the PhilosophieCosmique; but when he wrote of the ‘dual power’ and ‘two-in-one’ he also hadin mind Indian ideas likepurusha-prakriti, and certainly drew on his personalrelationship with the Mother. The Mother learned the termêtre psychiquefromTheon, and she passed this and other Cosmique terms on to Sri Aurobindo;but Aurobindo’s idea of the psychic being owes little to the Cosmique conceptof the soul. The Mother spoke to Aurobindo about Theon’scorps glorieux,and Aurobindo cited this term in a few letters. But before Aurobindo metthe Mother he wrote about four elements of physical perfection that are verysimilar to a list of elements in a Cosmique publication. This is, perhaps, a caseof independent inspiration without reference to prevailing conditions.Aurobindo never read any kabbalistic texts, so there is no question of hisbeing directly influenced by the kabbalah. It is possible, however, that hisidea of the Two-in-one was indirectly influenced by the kabbalistic idea ofdu-parzufimvia the Philosophie Cosmique and the Mother. Similarly, Aurobindo’sideas of the soul and physical perfection may have been indirectly influenced,via the same intermediaries, by the kabbalistic ideas of thezelemand AdamKadmon. On the other hand, it is possible that Aurobindo’s ideas on these mat-ters resemble kabbalistic ideas as a result of independent response to prevailingknowledge or to independent inspiration. Lurianic kabbalah and Aurobindo,but not the Philosophie Cosmique, accepted reincarnation. This may helpto explain the similarity between Isaac Luria’s and Aurobindo’s ideas of soul-evolution. But it is also possible that their ideas on this subject may have beenarrived at independently: two mystical thinkers arriving at the same idea as aresult of an identical or similar mystical experience.Aurobindo’s idea of ‘exclusive concentration of consciousness-force’ isremarkably similar to the Lurianic idea oftsimtsum.

This would seem to be a case of independentinspiration, due perhaps to Luria and Aurobindo having caught the same ideaduring spiritual reflection or experience. The idea of an originating contrac-tion or separation occurs also in the writings of other mystics, for exampleJakob Böhme and William Blake.73Thissuggeststhatacertainlineofmys-tical thought or experience can lead to a similar concept in different culturalcontexts.In recent years, historians of Western Esotericism have made comparativestudies of the bodies of thought I have examined above: Lurianic kabbalah,the Philosophie Cosmique, and the Integral Yoga.74Some of these scholarshave made strong claims about influence of Max Theon and his wife onSri Aurobindo and the Mother. In their history of the H.B. of L., Godwin,Chanel and Deveney write that Aurobindo and the Mother ‘were very largelyinspired by Theon and his wife’.75In his dissertation, Chanel goes farther: SriAurobindo and the Mother ‘may from many points of view be looked on asdisciples of the Theons or in any case as continuers of their work’. In anotherpassage Chanel suggests that the Theons have been denied due recognition byAurobindo’s followers: The PhilosophieCosmique, he asserts, ‘constitutes oneof theessentialsources of theteachingsof [Aurobindo’s] ashram in Pondicherry,even though this fact is, or was, generally little known or eclipsed’.76What I have written in the preceding sections should be enough to showthat these claims are exaggerated. Theon had a good deal of influence on theMother for three or four years, but he had no direct influence on Aurobindo.Whatever indirect influence he had on him was minor, being confined for themost part to terminology. The Mother may have considered herself a ‘disciple’73)For Böhme, see Brinton,Mystic Will, : ‘Creation begins with a painful separationfrom God and the creation of an independent will to the end that this separation may beovercome in a type of unity higher than that with which the process began.’ For Blake, see‘The Book of Urizen,’ chapter I.74)Chanel, Godwin and Deveney have pointed out correspondences between the Philoso-phie Cosmique and the yoga of Sri Aurobindo (see Chanel,Théon,andGodwinetal.,Hermetic Brotherhood). See also websites dealing with the Theons, such as ‘Kheper: transfor-mation—evolution—metamorphosis’, and ‘Max Theon et la philosophie cosmique’. Arti-cles pointing out correspondences between the kabbalah and Sri Aurobindo include Chat-terjee, ‘Isaac Kook and Sri Aurobindo’, and Kazlev, ‘The Divinisation of Matter’.75)Godwin et al.,Hermetic Brotherhood, .76)Chanel,Théon, , ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –of the Theons at some point, but the relationship between her and them wasjust one of several relationships she had with spiritual-occult figures beforeshe met Aurobindo. She carried over many ideas from the Theons into hercollaboration with Aurobindo, but their work together could hardly be called acontinuation of the work of the Theons, about whom Aurobindo had no directknowledge. All in all, the parallels between the Philosophie Cosmique andAurobindo’s philosophy are interesting but relatively unimportant comparedto the enormous influence of the Vedantic tradition of India, which Aurobindofully acknowledged.Chanel also notes that it is through the Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo ‘thatthe work of the Theons, that is, the Philosophie Cosmique, is present, thoughunbeknownstto many,in theworldtoday’.77This is true,andit draws attentionto what might be called the “multinational” side of the transmission of esotericknowledge. The Philosophie Cosmique, based in large measure on a form ofthekabbalahthattookshapeinwhatisnowIsrael,wasdevelopedinFranceandAlgeria during the early twentieth century, but now is scarcely remembered inany of these places. Elements of this teaching are present in the Integral Yoga, asystem of thought based largely on the Upanishads that was elaborated in Indiaby an English-educated Bengali and a Frenchwoman of Sephardic extraction.This system of yoga is followed by tens of thousands of people in India, andmany hundreds in Europe and North America. Thus elements of an esotericteaching made a journey from mediaeval Spain to Palestine and then back toEurope, where they were repackaged for dissemination in France. From Francethey were taken to India, and from India they have begun to make their wayback to the West.BibliographyAltman, Alexander,Essays in Jewish Intellectual History, Hanover, NH: University Press ofNew England .Alter, Joseph S.,Yoga in Modern India: The Body Between Science and Philosophy,Princeton,N.J.: Princeton University Press .Aurobindo, Sri,Autobiographical Notes and Other Writings of Historical Interest,Pondicherry:Sri Aurobindo Ashram .——— ,Letters on Yoga, Three volumes, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram .——— ,The Life Divine, Two volumes, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram .——— ,Record of Yoga, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram .——— ,On Himself, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo .77)Chanel,Théon, ."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Peter Heehs / ARIES . () –——— ,Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol, Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram .‘Basedelaphilosophiecosmique’[leaflet].n.p.:n.d.Brinton, Howard H.,The Mystic Will: Based upon a Study of Jacob Boehme, Reprint edition,Whitefish, Montana: Kessinger .Chanel, Christian,De la “Fratérnité Hermetique de Louxor” au “Mouvement Cosmique”:L’ oeuvre de Max Théon.
