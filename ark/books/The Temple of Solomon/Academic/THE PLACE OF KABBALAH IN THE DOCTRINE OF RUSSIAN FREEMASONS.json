T here is a long tradition in Russian science of scepticism concerning themain constituents of masonic tradition: mysticism, alchemy and Kabbalah.During the late 19th– early twentieth centuries, Russian scholars paid little at-tention to this topic, mainly because of their extreme positivistic views. In theSoviet period, the topic was taboo.Moreover, there are a number of objective difficulties in studying masonicteachings. Most masonic texts have not yet been published. Significant partsof masonic documents were destroyed by the masons themselves, or were lostas a result of government persecution. In addition, the masons themselves of-ten masked their involvement in Kabbalah and alchemy3. Thus the availablematerials are scarce and often encrypted.

In addition, we attempted to find possible intermediaries whoparticipated in transmission of this knowledge to their Russian masonic broth-ers.In our view, the question of the role of Kabbalah in masonic tradition isextremely important5. Below we try to describe the kabbalistic conceptswhich were especially interesting to Russian masons and contributed greatlyto their social and political thinking.Historical introductionThree main periods are normally discerned in the history of Russian freema-sonry during the 18th century. In the first, from the 1740s to the enthronementof Catherine the Great in 1762, freemasonry was ‘ merely a fashionable thingborrowed from the W est without any criticism’ . In the second period, whichlasted up to the early 1780s, freemasonry was ‘ the first moral philosophy inRussia; three first degrees of “ St. Jones” , or “ symbolic” freemasonry pre-vailed’6. The third period, when the “ higher degrees” , especially theRosicrucians, dominated in Russia, covers the 1780s7. The government per-4We refer mostly to the MS documents which are contained in the Division of Manuscripts(DMS) of the Russian State Library (RSL), in the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts(RSAAA), and in the Russian State Historical Archive of Moscow (RSHAM). For further details,see: Burmistrov and Endel, ‘ Kabbalah in Russian Masonry’ ; Burmistrov, ‘ Kabbalistic Exegeticsand Christian Dogmatics’ .5By “ Masonic tradition” we have in mind a complex system of theological, philosophical andmystical ideas which penetrated masonic teaching, propagated among the masons according totheir rules and traditions, and was used in practice when carrying out masonic works. Thus thisnotion includes not only a set of concepts but also a specific system of their treating, learning andinterpretation. For a review of the Russian mason’ s practices, see Smith, Working the RoughStone, 30-52.6That is these lodges comprised only three Masonic degrees, accepted in the Craft from thevery beginning: Pupil, Apprentice and Master.7See Semeka, ‘ Russian Masonry in the Eighteenth Century’ , 125."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"KABBALAH AND RUSSIAN FREEMASONS29secutions in the early 1790s put an end to the expansion of freemasonry. Themasons began to recover gradually their activity only after the death ofCatherine II and the enthronement of Paul I. This process continued at theearly 19th century, up to 1822 when Alexander I prohibited every freemasonicactivity in Russian.Two principal trends may be identified in Russian freemasonry of the late18th–early 19th centuries: rationalistic (deistic) and mystical. The trends werestrongly interrelated. Rationalistic freemasonry reached its acme in the 1760s-70s. In their outlook, literary preferences, social and political views, thesemasons were almost identical with Russian V oltaireans8, zealous supporters ofthe ideas of Enlightenment, natural law and physiocratism. Encouraged by the“ enlightened” Empress Catherine II, Russian V oltaireans sought to elaborate anew morality based on reason but not on Christian ethics9. To create this newmorality, it was necessary, however, to establish a tightly-knit secret organiza-tion for, in V oltaire’ s view, to allow common people to reason tended to resultin destroying the whole job. In the 1770s the centres of the novel “ religion ofreason” became lodges of the first Russian masonic union in St. Petersburg,headed by Ivan P . Elagin (1725-1793)10. These lodges were characterized byweak discipline and liberalism. It is obvious that any interest in mystical mat-ters in such a milieu was next to impossible. Curiously, the leader of the ma-sonic union, Elagin, studied kabbalistic teachings and used them in his ownwritings. At first, he was also a V oltaire enthusiast but later, having “ recov-ered” from V oltairianism, he broke away from rationalistic freemasonry11.The second trend in Russian freemasonry of the 18th century, the “ mystical”masons, involved stronger discipline in the lodges and unconditional submis-8Vernadsky, Russian Masonry in the Reign of Catherine the Great, 500, noted that properlyspeaking ‘ Masonic lodges of the 1770s were V oltairian institutions’ .9On the Russian V oltairian movement, see Mikhailov and Stroiev (eds.), V oltaire and Russia;Karp, French Enlighteners and Russia.10On the relationship between Russian Masons and V oltairians, see also V ernadsky, RussianMasonry in the Reign of Catherine the Great, 140-56 (Ch. 2, Pt. 2: ‘ Masonry andV oltairianism’ ); Semeka, ‘ Russian Masonry in the Eighteenth century’ , 132-49.11Elagin wrote later: ‘ I was attracted by godless writers who converted Christian faith intoblasphemy and Holy Scriptures into mockery, scoffs, and sneer [...] I became acquainted withatheists and deists [...] Boulanger [...] V oltaire, Rousseau, Helvetius [...] This reading cor-rupted my soul [...] and misled me [...] But the Actual Grace did not want my complete perdi-tion; it did allow neither to V oltaire’ s writings nor to those of other so-called new philosophersand encyclopaedists to convert my soul entirely [to their faith]’ . See Novikov, Freemasonry andRussian Culture, 228– 29. A similarly critical attitude to V oltairianism was evinced by the headof Moscow “ mystical” masons, Professor Johann Schwarz, and masonic activists such as IvanLopukhin and Aleksey Kutuzov.

Two great masonic systems are discernible within thistrend. The first was the so-called “ Knighthood” , a masonic union of the Swed-ish system with “ Capitulum Phoenix” at the head, founded in the late 1770s12.Splendid rituals were typical of this freemasonry; its members belongedmostly to the high life. The Grand Prefect of the Capitulum and the GrandMaster of the Great National Lodge (Swedish system) was Prince G .P . Gagarin(1745– 1808), and their Grand Secretary was one of the most authoritativeRussian masons I.V. Beber (1746– 1820)13. The Swedish lodges in Russia con-sisted mostly of noblemen who were strongly involved in political intriguesand had only little interest in mystical matters. Their leadership, “ CapitulumPhoenix” , comprised, however, devoted mystics and theosophers. They stud-ied Kabbalah, magic and alchemy, founded secret “ theoretical” lodges, anddreamed of being members of an “ invisible universal Capitulum” which, asthey believed, governed all the world14. Working in the deepest secrecy (mostof its members were unknown to the government and even to the ordinarymasons), “ Capitulum Phoenix” strongly affected almost all masonic activity inRussia in the late 18th–early 19th centuries.At the same time, in the 1780s, the teaching of the Order of Gold and RosyCross came to Russia from Germany and became the second movement ofRussian “ mystical” freemasonry. Let us briefly consider the history of this Or-der. T he Order of Gold and Rosy Cross emerged in Germany in the mid-1750s.There are several versions of its appearance. The Rosicrucians themselves be-lieved that the Order had been a successor of the ancient Rosicrucian traditionwhich arose in the fourteenth century and was manifested openly in the earlyseventeenth century (in turn, they claimed that this tradition descended from thePrimordial doctrine, granted to Adam)15. In the early 18th century, there ap-peared some writings on the teaching and main structural principles of aRosicrucian Order. In 1710 Samuel Richter, a Silesian minister, published a12See Sokolovskaia, Capitilum Phoenix.13Born in Weimar, Beber was a Lutheran; he taught physics and mathematics in the higherschools at St. Petersburg, and was a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.Beber had a passion for numerology, Kabbalah, and Swedenborg’ s teaching. He possessed a richcollection of books and manuscripts on the secret sciences.

NumerousRosicrucian centres were scattered throughout southern Germany, Austria,Hungary and northern Italy. In Germany, “ new” Rosicrucians “ debuted” firstin Sulzbach, in 1755-56; then the centre of their activity moved to Berlin17.Among the leaders of the movement were Bernhard J. Schleiss vonLö wenfeld, Johann G . Schrepfer, Friedrich J. W . Schrö der and Johann Ch. vonWö llner. These were the real creators of the famous secret organization knownas the Order of the Gold- and Rosy Cross.The Order was founded by Bernhard Joseph Schleiss von Lö wenfeld(1731-1800), a physician to the ducal house at Sulzbach who later received anearlship and became a councilor of the duke18. He took an obvious interest inKabbalah as if following the traditions of the Sulzbach Christian Kabbalah ofthe late seventeenth century. Curiously, in the last quarter of the seventeenthcentury, Sulzbach had become a centre of Christian kabbalistic studies. Underthe aegis of Prince Christian-August (1622-1702), the Duke of Sulzbach, livedand worked Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1636-89), known for his transla-tions of kabbalistic texts and the compiler of the anthology KabbalaDenudata19.It is no wonder that several decades later Schleiss reproduced the ideas ofKnorr, Francis Mercury van Helmont (1614-98), and other Christian kabba-lists of that group, and taught in his own writings how to regain a true spiritualteaching, the “ authentic Kabbalah” , from the alphabet of Nature. The mostimportant concepts of the Order had their source in Kabbalah: the idea on the16Sincerus Renatus [S.

Jewish elements played an important role inRosicrucian rituals24. It is noteworthy that all the abovementioned kabbalisticideas adopted by this Order were later incorporated by the Russian masons25.The ultimate goal of the Order is described as follows: ‘ To awake hiddenforces of nature, to liberate the natural light which was deeply buried under thedross after the damnation, and to kindle in every brother a burning torch thatwould help him to see easy the concealed God [...] and thus to join moreclosely to the primeval Source of Light’26.The history of the Order was described in detail in the book The Compassof Wisemen, which was extremely popular in the masonic milieu27.

Sefirot are conceived as ten stages of emanation from Ein-Sof, the Infinite, God Himself. Each Sefirah denotes a certain aspect of God as a Creator. The tenSefirot together form the Tree of Sefirot, the universal structure of the whole creation. This Treeis considered a dynamic unity where the Divine manifestation is unfolded.

The author was apparently Johann Christoph vonWö llner (1732-1800)28, one of the greatest German masons and an ideologistof the Order. A set of right-wing political and religious thinkers belonging tothe German intellectual establishment gathered around Wö llner, who wasknown for his ultra-conservative religious views.In the 1780s the Rosicrucians gained considerable influence at the Prussiancourt. One of their leaders, Johann Rudolph von Bischofswerder (1741-1803),convinced Prince Friedrich-Wilhelm (1744-1797), the Prussian heir apparent,to join the Order and in 1781 Friedrich-Wilhelm became a member (his Ordername was Ormesus Magnus). Following his enthronement, the Rosicruciansbegan to make internal and external policy in Prussia; Wö llner and Bischofs-werder were appointed to ministerial posts and became intimate advisors ofFriedrich-Wilhelm. Wö llner, the head of the Department of religious affairs,established a religious censorship, “ Immediat-Examinations-Kommission” , akind of Lutheran inquisition (1791), and persecutions of the enlighteners be-gan. The political power of the Order in Prussia came to end in 1797, follow-ing the death of Friedrich-Wilhelm II.In the south too, the Order was suppressed. After interdiction of alchemy inAustria (1785), it continued to work illegally. In 1790 it again rose to thesurface for a while, under Leopold II (1747-1792), the Holy Roman Emperorfrom 1790 to 1792. He was one of the most capable of the 18th-century reform-ist rulers known as the “ enlightened despots” and took a deep interest in al-chemy and Kabbalah. Following his death in 1792 the new emperor, Francis II(1768-1835), banned the Order once again29.Wö llner, as well as Johann Ch. A. T heden (1714-1797), and their envoy inMoscow, Baron Heinrich-Jacob Schrö der (1757-c.1797)30, were the chiefs ofthe Moscow Brothers and the main source of masonic information and mysti-cal literature. Russian masons had already known about the Rosicrucians inthe mid-1770s31; the Order began to act in Russia, however, only after JohannV ersammlungsreden der Gold- und Rosenkreutzer des alten Systems (Russian translations waspublished in the secret Masonic typography, Moscow, 1784).28See Schuster, Secret Societies, Unions and Orders, V ol. 2, 64.

He received from theman appointment as ‘ the only Supreme Director’ of the Rosicrucian Order in theRussian Empire, acts of the “ Theoretic Degree”32 and permission to begin thework in Moscow33. The influence of the Order was so great that after 1780stwo parallel and almost independent trends existed in Russian freemasonry:the traditional masons and the Rosicrucians34. The strongest interest in JewishKabbalah was manifested among the Russian Rosicrucians. The centre of theiractivity was the Moscow circle of Johann Schwarz and Nikolay I. Novikov(1744-1818). Having revised the ideas of ancient and medieval Christian mys-tics, alchemists, Christian kabbalists as well as European mystics of the 17th–18th centuries, they elaborated their own doctrine. Their social and politicalviews were imbued with conservatism and religious enthusiasm. Inspired bythe ideas of Louis-Claude de Saint Martin (1743-1803)35 and GermanRosicrucians, they considered religion and the masonic movement instrumentsto preserve the political system and social stability. They pondered over anideal masonic state ruled by a mystical Order, under the sovereignty of the“ Holy King” . The Rosicrucians approached the conservative party of CountsNikita I. Panin (1718-1783) and Peter I. Panin (1721-1789) seeking contactswith Crown Prince Paul (in their view, the putative future “ Holy King” )36. Thisactivity resulted in persecution of Russian masons, who fell into disgrace withthe government in the late 1780s-early 1790s.Below we concentrate only on masonic circles whose members weredeeply involved in studying theoretical facets of European mysticism, al-chemy and Kabbalah and who sought to embody their knowledge in their owncompositions, in their practices of God-knowing, mystical contemplation andpraying.

They were a minority in Russian masonry (about 2-3%) but had a great authority and influence. There is almost no evidence con-cerning any interest for Kabbalah in the main masonic Rites working in Russiain the late 18th - early 19th centuries: Ecossais Rectifeé , Strikt- and Laxe-Observanz, the Templers, etc. The structure of masonry in Russia was ratherflexible: some lodges and unions could fiercely fight with each other but aftera while they united together (as it happened in the 1770s with Elagin’ s Englishunion and Reuchel’ s Swedish-Berlin lodges). Besides, the same masons areknown to have belonged to several Rites simultaneously and even to have heldthere the leading offices. The doctrines of Western masonry were perceivedby the Russian Brothers with great criticism. Therefore it is difficult to definethe things they truly believed when analyzing official documents of this or thatmasonic system they belonged to. In our opinion, the interest in Kabbalah andother secret sciences in Russian masonry was characteristic not for certainRites, Orders and Degrees, but for the individual spiritual and intellectualquest of some Russian mystics. For example, among the main enthusiasts ofKabbalah was Ivan Elagin, the chief of the first masonic English union in Rus-sia (see below), but his lodges did not deal with Kabbalah and other occultteachings at all. It is also important to emphasize the strong influence exertedto the mystical strivings of the Russian masons by Russian Orthodoxy. Most ofthe Russian Rosicrucians and “ theoretic” masons were true Orthodox Chris-tians well-read in patristic literature. The Byzantine and Russian Orthodoxspiritual traditions (St. (Pseudo)-Dionysius Areopagita, St. Maximus the Con-fessor, St. Simeon the New Theologian, St. Gregory Palamas) which were ex-tremely important for them, define to a great extent the originality of theirmasonic views.It is necessary also to discriminate masonic documents such as statutes,theoretic manuals, catechisms, etc. from manifold writings which comprisedthe “ circle of reading” of the Russian masons (a great bulk of translated andoriginal texts including patristic literature, books of Catholic and Protestantmystics, pietists, theosophers, alchemists, and some treatises on historiosophyand theology written by the Russian Brothers). In masonic documents as such,it is hardly possible to find any references to Kabbalah; even if this term isused there it has only a “ metaphorical” sense.37 On the contrary, the “ circle of37See on this “ metaphorical” Kabbalah Kilcher’ s Die Sprachtheorie der Kabbala alsä sthetisches Paradigma."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"36KONSTANTIN BURMISTROV & MARIA ENDELmasonic reading” contains dozens of texts relating to Christian and JewishKabbalah (see below).Thus we can treat the kabbalistic interests of some Russian masons not as apeculiar “ intramasonic” phenomenon caused by their European mentors but asan original trend in the history of Russian thought that emerged due to anumber of different factors.The spiritual image of Russian masonsFirst, we try to present a brief description of the spiritual image of those whofelt themselves to be members of the Rosicrucian Order. Their Weltan-schauung is commonly considered as a reaction to V oltairianism, and as a Rus-sian phenomenon of the 18th century, the so-called “ freethinking”38. In abroader context, however, their views may be regarded as an attempt to over-come the deep religious and intellectual crisis suffered by Russian society inthe 18th century. As was noted by G . Florovsky, the Russian theologian, ‘ All thehistoric importance of the Russian freemasonry resided in the fact that it repre-sented psychological ascesis and reintegration of the [Russian] soul. In free-masonry, the Russian soul goes back to itself after a long period of dissipation[...] This was spiritual awakening from a dead faint’39.In the last quarter of the 18th century, a specific “ mystical” sub-culture, witha definite set of stereotypes and symbols and an inevitable taint of mystery andfeeling of selectivity, was developing. An extremely intensive spiritual life fo-cused on a continuous search for the true path, with all its doubts and disap-pointments, was typical of those who belonged to this subculture40. Russianmasons were eclectic in what they read and in their religious exercises; it isdifficult to imagine how they could combine Orthodox piety with alchemicworks and kabbalistic practice. In all their doings, we feel an enormous andastonishingly forceful longing for a faith-cure of the world and for the trans-figuration of man.This should explain the highly active social position of many masons dur-ing the age of Catherine the Great. Fore example, a great role in Russian en-lightenment was played by a publishing house established by the best-knownRussian mason of the age, N. I. Novikov. Due to his work, in addition to spe-cial masonic editions, hundreds of books were translated and published. Theyincluded writings by Oriental and European Christian mystics as well as com-38See, for example, Semeka, ‘ Russian Masonry in the Eighteenth century’ , 134.39Florovsky, Paths of Russian Theology, 115.40See Serkov and Reizin (eds.), Letters of N.I.

V ery typical ofRussian masons was charity work, such as free distribution of bread in meagreyears, establishment of a number of free homes and public schools throughoutRussia, rendering assistance to poor brothers, etc. Furthermore, Moscow ma-sons were seriously occupied with pedagogical activity. Thus they played animportant role in the establishment of Moscow University and a number ofscientific and student organizations. The development of Russian theatre, ofthe pharmacy in Russia etc. also are linked to the names of outstanding ma-sons. Many of them held high positions in state and military services. It isnoteworthy that they were concerned not only with the best organization ofsociety and nature as a whole but also with their own farming and agronomy;thus they nursed their estates, and their mystical experience correlated wellwith their economic activity.Moscow Rosicrucians were also deeply involved in political activities; thewell-known official persecutions of Russian masons in the 1790s were causedby suspicions that they had plotted a take-over. Behind this social activity wasa fundamental concept of the world and the human race, reflecting a masonicversion, rooted in gnosticism, of the biblical myth of the fall of man. Masonscollected ideas and concepts coherent with this basic view within variousphilosophic and religious systems. An important element of their search wasKabbalah. The main sources of knowledge in the field were original kabbalis-tic texts and those of Christian kabbalists. Some works of Protestant mysticsand pietists of the seventeenth century also served as important sources. Inturn, Protestant mystical concepts of universal salvation and readjustment ofthe world can be traced back to the doctrine of Tikkun ha-olam in the LurianicKabbalah41. In addition, a number of transformed kabbalistic ideas were bor-rowed from European mystics of the 18th century such as E. Swedenborg, F.Oetinger, L.-C. de Saint-Martin; some Russian masons were known to be ac-quainted with them personally.41This kabbalistic school was established by Isaak Luria (Ha-Ari) in Safed in the 1570s. Onthe influence of Lurianic doctrine on European mysticism see: Coudert, The Impact of theKabbalah in the Seventeenth Century, esp. 120-132; Burmistrov, ‘Kabbala Denudata Redis-covered’ ; id. ‘ Kabbalah in European Culture’ . Tikkun ha-olam (Heb., “ Improvement of the Uni-verse” ) – in Lurianic Kabbalah, the process of universal restoration and redintegration of theprimeval harmony, destroyed by the general cataclasm of the “ breaking of vessels” (shevirat ha-kelim). A special task in tikkun is entrusted to man who is to make the improvement of the lowestregions of the universe and to liberate the sparks of light imprisoned there by means of hispersonal illumination and cleaving to the Holy One.

At the first stage,it teaches him to possess the light of the perennial, supernal Being, AdamKadmon, and he should strive toward His perfection. At the second stage, itoffers him the integrated image of the kabbalistic world of ten Sefirot and fourOlamot42. This is especially important at the third stage when Kabbalah be-comes necessary for understanding the “ spiritual language” of the Scripturesand this by use of Kabbalistic hermeneutics. It is not strange that precisely therules and methods of kabbalistic hermeneutics were so important for Russianmasons; we can find their description in almost all masonic manuscripts de-voted to kabbalistic matters.Notwithstanding all the differences and the diversity of the masonic sys-tems, one may discern some basic concepts, or models, of comprehension un-derlying the masonic Weltanschauung, or, more strictly, of masonic epistemol-ogy which determines, to a great extent, the masonic outlook. The attitude wasformulated in brief by N. I. Novikov in his ‘ Notice to readers’ in the masonicmagazine V echerniaia zaria (1782). Speaking about the aims of his new maga-zine, he writes:When the wise Creator of the universe made the visible world, to give light uponit, He fastened on the firmament countless number of glittering lights. Within thesmall world, i.e. man, for enlightening his ways, He fired the light of mind whichwas so great at the beginning that there was no secret so deep that he could notpenetrate it. But not for long could man use this light; he appropriated it, andreflected back the Divine beams, and became gloomy. Darkness covered his pre-vious enlightenment43.In fact, the concept of the perennial man, Adam Kadmon, his Fall and hisReturn, is the very heart of the masonic system. It is precisely this idea whichunderlies their doctrine of the primordial unity of mankind which has beendestroyed and is to be repaired. The mason himself is likened here to Adam,that is to one who has possessed, from the very beginning, numerous virtuesand true knowledge. This symbol is very important for masonic myth. It ishighly syncretic: it includes elements drawn from biblical, apocryphal, her-metic, Gnostic, Christian and kabbalistic texts. The teaching about two Adamsplays a special role here. The first Adam has the features of Adam before theFall, with the universalism of Adam Kadmon, the perennial supernal being in42On these kabbalistic concepts see Scholem, Kabbalah, 96-116.43(Anon.), ‘ To the readers’ , V echernyaya Zarya (Evening Glow) 1 (1782), 2."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"KABBALAH AND RUSSIAN FREEMASONS39whose image man and the world were created and whose soul contained soulsof all people, and of perennial Jesus-Messiah. The second Adam, or Jesusincarnated, is considered a manifestation, or Hieroglyph, of the first Adam44.The writings of Russian masons belong to a Christian (probably heterodox)tradition, but Adam Kadmon is interpreted here in accordance with kabbalisticviews. Thus in discussing the problem of the manifest and non-manifest God,an author notes:In order to make these emanations and images of Divine features and powers, theinfinite Primitive Cause, infinite Spirit or infinite Light emanated [from itself]the fundamental First Principle through which come further emanations. It isAdam Kadmon, i.e. archetypal perennial Man (Urmensch). This first-begottenLord’ s [Son] was revealed in ten kinds of emanation, or in ten images, and pro-duced outwardly the same number of sources of lights: they are called Sefirot,Sefirs, primordial figures, figures of things (Urzahlen)45.For masonic myth, the concept of the Fall which was identical with the loss ofwisdom, perennial Knowledge, and Light by Adam, is of extreme importance.All masonic activity is aimed at restoring this lost wisdom. Like Christian kab-balists of the fifteenth– sixteenth centuries, the Russian masons often consid-ered Kabbalah the perennial knowledge granted to Adam in Eden. For exam-ple, in the same masonic text one may read:The kabbalists say that God declared this secret knowledge to Adam, but Adam,because of his fall, tore away from the Kingdom of God and the Lord’ s Anointed,and because of this he lost this wisdom, realized the importance of his loss, againreturned to the source of felicity, and passed this truth on to his posterity. There isnothing here that we could not accept. But in Kabbalah (excluding many addi-tions filled with lies), this is expressed in the language of images. Kingdom(Königreich = Malchut) here is the most inferior Sefirot [i.e. Sefirah] in which isconcentrated the light of all the Sefirot emanated from the infinite Source of Lightthrough Archetypal Man (Urmensch = Adam Kadmon = Son of God). By itsAlmighty Power, It [i.e. Light] leads man and all the creatures out to their Beati-tude. Inasmuch as Adam had a desire to be his own lord for himself, or to be equalto God, he tore away this Sefirot [i.e. Sefirah], i.e. the Kingdom of God, andtogether with it tore away the Leaf, or the Twig from the Tree of Sefirot (tore awayNature from the influence of the Heavenly Light), and after that he was coveredwith shame by the sensation of the death that he attracted to himself by his tearingaway from the Tree of Life and from the Light which is the Heavenly Man46.It is suggested that one may attain great wisdom due to the process of self-knowledge; this is considered to be the cognition of both Nature and the Crea-44See Saint Martin, On Errors and Truth, 35, 70.45DMS RSL, F . 14, N 992 (‘ A Short Notion on Kabbalah’ , the early 19th century), f. 14-14r.46DMS RSL, F . 14, N 992, f. 3r-4."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"40KONSTANTIN BURMISTROV & MARIA ENDELtor, because of the isomorphism of the macrocosm (“ the universe” ) and mi-crocosm (“ the small world” , “ man” ). As it is said in a masonic song, ‘ Whiletrying Nature in myself, / the Creation and the Creator shall I comprehend; /striving to penetrate into myself, / I can know Him by my soul’47.Florovsky notes reasonably that ‘ dogmatically freemasonry was, in es-sence, a revival of Neoplatonic and Gnostic doctrines, renewed since the Ren-aissance. The most important thing was the idea of the Fall, “ a spark of light”captured by the darkness. Not so much a strong feeling of sin as a sensation ofimpurity was typical of the masons. And it is resolved not so much by penanceas by abstinence’48.It is interesting that self-knowledge, at least in its first stage, presupposesthat the man involved is frightened by his sins and chooses the way of im-provement. Masonic mystical knowledge, mystical illumination, up to the un-ion with the Godhead, is possible only for ‘ bearers of spirit’ who, by way ofmoral self-correction, ‘ developed in themselves abilities that, after their fullrevelation, raise him up to the lower regions of the realm of angels’49. Preach-ing about personal self-perfection and mysticism are tightly connected herewith each other, ‘ for the truth is a mystery that may be revealed not by mentalefforts but by moral great deeds of the will [...] one can know everything onlyby overcoming the sinfulness of human nature’50 and with the attainment ofthe knowledge and light that were lost by the first man, Adam. As mentionedabove, Adam is an archetype for the mason, who is sinful, on the one hand, but,on the other hand, has the opportunity to return to the previous sinless andperfect condition. This condition can be attained after numerous trials whosefirst preparatory stage is moral self-correction.Also we are not deprived of this light, it is present within us, but it is obscuredand suppressed by our wicked deeds. It shines also in Nature but as it does notshine within ourselves we could not see it outside. And so the true sages of theancient and modern times declare self-knowledge the first exercise of the man[...] Self-knowledge ought to begin with perception and improvement of ourmoral acts, and after that we can learn the intrinsic mysteries of human nature51.In fact, at the next stage, ‘ when our spirit is prepared in such a way, and thelight within us is unveiled, then we can put our attention to the external thingsor the nature, and to recognize the great perfection, skills, and the greatness of47Published in: Magazin svobodno-kamenshchicheskiy (Free-Masonic Magazine) 1:1, 142.48Florovsky, Paths of Russian Theology, 119.49Kiesewetter, ‘ Moscow Rosicrucians of the Eighteenth Century’ , 116.50Ibid., 117.51(Anon.), ‘ To the readers’ , 3."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"KABBALAH AND RUSSIAN FREEMASONS41its Architect in its marvelous construction. Finally, who desires to see the greatwisdom in its full brightness, let him start to read Holy Writ ardently and zeal-ously; he will find there all the mysteries of the Divine and Natural explainedby the spiritual language’52.Therefore the masonic theory of knowledge requires the initiate to passthrough three stages. In the first stage, he is occupied with moral self-correc-tion and knowing the mysteries intrinsic to man. In the second stage, he mustcome to know Nature. In the third stage, the mysteries of Nature and God areunderstood at a higher level using the “ spiritual language” of the Scriptures53.This three-stage path is considered the return to that time when ‘ the book ofnature was opened for human understanding, and man could comprehend allits mysteries by his mind’54. This return is possible, however, due to masteringthe knowledge Adam possessed in Paradise. The masons believe that after hisfall hekept everything in his memory [...] and through his memory, he taught his de-scendants the sciences that he had known in Eden about nature and its Ruler.Afterwards, some of them kept these teachings of wisdom and transmitted themby word of mouth to the next generation [...] One may claim with great confi-dence that the teachings of our forefathers were transmitted to posterity withgreat accuracy [...] However because of the multiplication of the human raceover the surface of the Earth, and their dissemination throughout the world, theprecepts about knowledge and truth taken from the First Man were transformedinto fallacies [...] that is why they have been kept in all their previous power andperfection in but a few people55.Thus, an ancient and authentic tradition was necessary to save this knowledge.When Russian masons travelled throughout Europe, studying the works ofWestern mystics, alchemists and Christian kabbalists, masonic and Rosi-crucian documents, they sought just this tradition. In this way, they had thegreatest respect for Kabbalah.52Ibid., 3-4.53Similar reasoning can be find in several MSs for example in Besedi iz T eoreticheskogoGradusa Solomonskih vedeniy (Conversations from the Theoretic Degree of SolomonCognizances, DMS RSL, F . 14, N 250, f. 93-93r) we read: ‘ Y ou are sufficiently learned that Godteaches us in three ways: (1) He points us at the Nature as the manifested Wisdom Divine; (2) Hegives to us the rule for Improvement of our Manners; (3) through all this, He guides us to TrueInnermost Theology, or to living cognition of the Divine Word.

And it is just theKabbalah which contains those hieroglyphs, that ‘ represent attributes of thingsin the world’58. Moreover, up to the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, Kabbalah wasthe only source of the primeval Light and primordial Wisdom Adam had takenout of Paradise.Similar views are expressed in the works of Ivan Elagin, one of the mostoutstanding Russian masons of the 18th century:Kabbalah is a symbolic or formative doctrine of Divine mysteries received andaccepted from God, which is essential and useful for the holy God-seeing. There-fore, this teaching is considered the true knowledge of allegories, symbols, andhieroglyphs of the Divine words [...] [Solomon] bade to extract sense and under-standing from the law of Holy Scripture on grounds of kabbalistic doctrine. Thusthe main essence of Kabbalah is to leave the external and literal sense of HolyScripture and word of God, and to penetrate the interior thoughts of the HolyGhost59.In the opinion of J. Schwarz, the leader of Moscow Rosicrucians in the early1780s, masonry was a secret science whose first adepts were Jewishsectarians. T he principle underlying the doctrine of Rosicrucians is the con-cept of a “ spark of light” transferred from one wise man to another through thechain of Tradition. ‘ Thus this mystery [i.e. the primordial doctrine, receivedby Rosicrucians] passed to the religious Jewish sects of Essenes andTherapeutes which existed in the days of Christ and were renowned for theirvirtuousness [...] Just from these Essenes was derived a glorious Order ofRosicrucians who received the “ spark of light” , together with the virtue of56A conditional term denoting a special masonic version of Jewish Kabbalah based on itsinterpretation by Christian kabbalists of the fifteenth– seventeenth centuries.

In such a way, according to Russian masons, was the funda-mental masonic tradition established61.Tikkun ha-olam: the aims of masonic activity and KabbalahMasonic activity was not reduced however to self-knowledge, knowledge ofNature, and God. Its underlying principle was a kabbalistic and alchemicalimpulse for the improvement and salvation of the world fallen with Adam. Theprocess of universal improvement (tikkun) is described in some masonic texts.The clearest exposition is contained in the treatise “ An Oration of the Man ofEziless”62. The necessity of tikkun is caused by a disruption in the process ofcreation that resulted in serious structural alterations in the world. Like medi-eval kabbalists, masonic authors, however, were sure that this disruption wasan inevitable stage on the way of transformation, or “ softening” of the Divineattribute of Judgment (Sefirah Din), which is intrinsic to the very nature ofGod. Indeed, ‘ as God is omniscient, He could not help knowing what hap-pened with His creation; and as He is omnipotent, He could have built in sucha way that no corruption would happen afterwards’63. However, the art ofCreation is similar to the work of a goldsmith, in whose arms ‘ gold [...] istransformed in different ways, needless parts are detached and gathered again,they are purified and become better then they have been before’64. The amend-ment and improvement of the creation, i.e. the transformation of the force ofJudgment into the force of Charity, is likened also to the alchemical transmuta-tion of Copper (=Judgment, Sefirah Din) to Silver (Charity, Sefirah Hesed)65.Anyway, it is man who must purify and amend the spheres of the Universeaccessible to him; special groups of elected initiates, i.e. masons, played apivotal role in the process.60Semeka, ‘ Russian Rosicrucians and the works by Catherine II against Masonry’ , 350.61See ibid., 358. It is noteworthy that one of the masonic pseudoepigrapha, Letter of theRabbi of Lisbon to the Rabbi of Brest (1817; originally written in Polish), states that the Craft (or“ Hafshim Goderim” Sociery) has been established by the biblical characters; masonry itself isconsidered there a secret Jewish order whose members, inter alia, acknowledge Christianity.

Masons believed that by unveiling the hid-den meaning of the Scriptures they would be able to comprehend the depth ofthe universe, to establish an intercourse with the spiritual world and to dis-cover the ways for emendation of the fallen world including human societyand human nature. With this end in view, some of them studied Hebrew andtried to read and interpret the Hebrew Bible while turning to kabbalistic sym-bols and methods (gematria, notarikon, temurah). W e cite below an excerpttaken from a private letter where an active Rosicrucian, prince Nikolay N.Trubetskoi (1744-1821)66, explains to a mason of a higher initiation, AlekseyA. Rzhevski (1737-1804)67, the importance of Kabbalah for masonic work.This text is especially significant for our discourse for it reflects the real inter-ests and everyday problems of Russian masons. In the beginning, its authorwrites about ‘ the importance and necessity of Hebrew’ for masonic art68. Thenhe argues that you should not study kabbalistic interpretations of the Scrip-tures (i.e. “ spiritual matters” ) until you have comprehended the science of na-ture (i.e. “ material matters” ).I guess that the mysterious sense of Mosaic writings is conceivable not by calcu-lation, or creation of a new word from each letter; for the words as Moses haswritten them are not the same now as they were at his time [...] The direct way tothe achievement of truth is that of Abraham who, at the beginning, had known aslave and engendered with her Ishmael, and afterwards he got Isaac from Sarah.For this science [i.e. Kabbalah] not only unveils spiritual things but we may saythat it is spiritual by itself; but how can a mortal know about the spiritual mattersuntil he has known about the material ones [...] Those who practise this science66He was one of the most active and devoted Rosicrucians, a member of the Friendly LearnedSociety and masonic “ Typographic Company” . See Serkov, Russian Masonry, 811.67A. A. Rzhevski – a member of the Rosicrucian Order, writer and translator. See Serkov,Russian Masonry, 696; Serkov, A.I. and Reizin, M.V. (eds.), Letters of N.I.

Therefore, Moses himselfcould not attain spiritual matters when he was completely unfamiliar with thematerial ones. This is why I conclude that the meaning of [what Moses has said]is going from mouth to mouth up to our times, and that this mysterious meaningis contained not in letters but in the words themselves. For example, in the firstchapter of Genesis, the word “ et” (“ eth” , in Hebrew) indicates the clearest es-sence; but also it is the conjunction “ and” , therefore it was translated as “ and theearth” ; it is still possible to translate as “ essence of the earth” . However if some-body had previously an experience in studying the material matters in nature andhas some knowledge of Hebrew, then he is able easily, without calculation, torecognize the true meaning of Moses’ [words...] And one who knows the truesense of the [word] Elohim, the acting person in the first chapter of Genesis, willunderstand easily that the material matters should be conceived before the spir-itual ones... I hope however for your modesty, venerable Brother, that afterreading you will tear this letter into pieces, and will not discuss its content withanybody...69.Referring to the masonic tradition as a whole, we can conclude that Russianmasons used Kabbalah, firstly, as a basis for their cosmogonic system, ex-plaining the hierarchical construction of the heavenly world, and for commu-nication with this world. Secondly, Kabbalah provided the keys for interpret-ing the Scriptures and discovering the deepest and secret layers of the biblicaltext. It is possible to discern, moreover, behind the masonic soteriology someadapted kabbalistic concepts, and first and foremost – the concept of Tikkunha-olam70. For the masons, Kabbalah contains the true knowledge about God,the world, and man and not only facilitates the process of universal amend-ment but also determines its paths and ways.Kabbalistic texts in the literature of Russian masonsAs we have also mentioned above, we managed to discover in Moscow Statearchives a significant number of masonic MSs which indicate a deep interestin and a good acquaintance of Russian Brothers with Jewish Mysticism. Wehave divided these texts into three main groups71.69Ibid., 236-237. This letter is dated from the mid-1780s.70This kabbalistic concept was adopted and expressed distinctly in the doctrine of the mysti-cal school, established by Martines de Pasqually and his pupil L.C. de Saint-Martin. Their writ-ings and ideas enjoyed great popularity among Russian Brothers. See Van Rijnberk, UnThaumaturge au XVIIIe siè cle; Le Forestier, La franc-maç onnerie occultiste au XVIIIe siè cle &l’ ordre des Elus Coens; Waite, The Life of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, the Unknown Philoso-pher.71We discuss this issue in detail in Burmistrov and Endel, ‘ Kabbalah in Russian Masonry’ ,23-33."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"46KONSTANTIN BURMISTROV & MARIA ENDELThe first group comprises translations of real kabbalistic texts or their frag-ments. It should be stressed that masonic translations are hardly similar totranslations in the strict meaning of the word. They are rather mixtures oftranslations and commentaries, loose translations and expositions, with addi-tions made by the translator or interpolations from other texts. Therefore, it isvery difficult to identify the different layers in these texts and comprehend allthe transformations made from the original texts.Russian masons of the late 18th century were familiar with one of the basictexts of Jewish mysticism, Sefer Yezirah (The Book of Creation, 3– 6 centuriesC.E.), a short cosmogonic treatise about the creation of the universe and manby means of Hebrew letters and numbers72. At least two Russian translationsof this text are kept now in MSs collections73. Also in several writings one canmeet long quotations from Sefer ha-Zohar (The Book of Splendour, 13th cen-tury)74 which appears to have been the most important and well known kabba-listic text for Russian masons75.We also found a very interesting translation of the famous treatise ShaareOrah (The Gates of Light) by Joseph Gikatilla (the 13th century)76, with nu-merous quotations from the classic commentary to this text written byMattityahu Delacrut, a Polish kabbalist of the 16th century. In the same MScodex there is an abridged version of Ma‘ amar ’ Adam de-’ Azilut, an anony-mous text belonging to Lurianic Kabbalah77. These texts seem to be a directtranslation from Hebrew, but they contain so many interpolations that it isreasonable to conclude their translator was a true Christian kabbalist78.72This text is very popular in the Jewish tradition; many Jewish mystics and philosophershave commented it. See Scholem, Kabbalah, 23-30. This work was also very important for theChristian kabbalists who translated it to the Latin and other European languages. See re-editionof the Latin translation made by G . Postel (1552): Sefer Jezirah (in the Introduction, the role ofthis text in the Christian Kabbalah is elucidated).

In ouropinion, texts like these demonstrate their knowledge of Hebrew and quitepossibly their acquaintance with Kabbalists who possessed an oral tradition.The second group comprises translations into Russian of the works of Euro-pean Christian kabbalists and researchers of Kabbalah. It is represented bytranslations made mostly from German and Latin. In this connection suchworks as True and Right Kabbalah by Wilhelm Kriegesmann, A Short V ersionof the Kabbalistic Teaching by Jacob Brucker, and The Jewish Kabbalah byCaspar Schott should be mentioned79. The authors of these writings based theirknowledge of Kabbalah on the works of Pico della Mirandola, JohannesReuchlin, Pietro di Galatino, Athanasius Kircher and other Christian kabbalistsof the 15th-17th centuries; they used many quotations taken both from theseworks and from the kabbalistic texts, first of all, from Sefer ha-Zohar. In thesetexts, kabbalistic concepts are described in detail: for example, the teachings onthe Sefirot, the Names of God, the mystical meaning of Hebrew letters, thekabbalistic exegetical methods (gematria, notarikon, temurah), and the so-called “ astrological Kabbalah” .In our opinion, the most interesting is the third group that contains originalwritings of Russian masons devoted to kabbalistic matters80. Only these textsallow us to reconstruct masonic views related to Kabbalah. It seems very im-portant to find out who were the putative authors or translators of these texts.As we mentioned above, the “ kabbalistic” texts belong not to the “ intra-masonic” writings but rather to the “ circle of masonic reading” .

The head of the Palace chancel-lery, he played an important role in political life82. It is known that Catherineherself sometimes jokingly signed documents as “ Chancellor of Mr. Elagin” .Joined to the Craft in 1750s, in 1770 he had been elected Grand Master of theGrand Provincial Lodge of Russia under the auspices of the Berlin GrandLodge, “ Royal Y ork” . Thus he became the chief of the first masonic union inRussia. On February 26, 1772 he received from the Great Master of the UnitedGreat Lodge of England the certificate of the first Provincial Grand Master ofthe Empire of Russia in Russian history. In the middle of the 1770s, Elagin’ sSystem included not less than 14 lodges and maintained contacts with manyEuropean lodges83. The new stage in his activity began in the late 1780s, whenhe established a renewed masonic association and became its Grand Master. Inthe closing stages of his life, he wrote a voluminous composition A Treatise onRussia (Opit povestvovaniya o Rossii), an uncompleted work on Russian his-tory, where his masonic views were presented84.In the Introduction to one of his unpublished writings, Elagin described indetail his spiritual biography. He joined masonry in his youth but did not findanything attractive there and soon left the lodge. After a short period of enthu-siasm for V oltaire and Helvetius he returned to masonic activity with muchmore serious intentions. He looked for the teachers who could initiate him intothe mysteries of Divine knowledge, he was ready to learn and to teach thisknowledge all his life. By his own words, it was his high position in masonrythat impelled him continuously ‘ to strive hard to solve [i.e. to understand] thismysterious and numinous teaching’85. For, as he writes in the same Introduc-tion, ‘ my sincerity did not allow me to lead my Brothers in the way unknown tomyself. Therefore I began with all my thoroughness to spend vast sums of82On Elagin and his masonic system see V ernadsky, Russian Masonry in the Reign ofCatherine the Great, 44-70, 94– 98; Semeka, ‘ Russian Masonry in the Eighteenth Century’ , 139-149; Pypin, Masonry in Russia, 96-137; Pekarski, Supplements to the history of Masonry inRussia in the Eighteenth Century, 50-55; Smith, Working the Rough Stone, 104-105.

The result of theseexpenses was, however, an understanding that it is impossible to buy truth formoney, and that ‘ for real [i.e. common] gold’ you can receive but ‘ the searchfor imaginary gold’ . Thus at the end of 1770s Elagin was disappointed in theEnglish system of masonry which was taught in Russian lodges when he hadbeen their Head. In despair, Elagin immersed himself in reading the Old andNew Testaments and Fathers of the Church. Then he began to feel the neces-sity of studying Greek and Hebrew.On this new path, the most important role was played by his acquaintancewith Baron Johannes George von Reuchel (1729-1791)87. Baron von Reuchelwas the Head of lodges that worked according to the Swedish-Berlin system ofJohann Wilhelm Ellenberger (von Zinnendorf) (1731-1782), known as the“ System of Relaxed Observation” (“ Laxe Observanz” )88. V on Reuchel’ s ma-sonic union, established in St. Petersburg in 1771, was in fact an opponent toElagin’ s masonry, and therefore rather complicated relations were establishedbetween them. At the same time, von Reuchel became Elagin’ s mentor on hisspiritual path. In the words of Elagin, this ‘ respectable brother, initiated in thetrue masonry’ , explained to him ‘ an ancient mysterious knowledge called theSacred Wisdom’89. There is some evidence that Reuchel also was interested inKabbalah and Talmud90. It was Reuchel who provided Elagin with variousmystical MSs and explained their secret and symbolic meaning. He gave himmany masonic texts and for many years (at least, from 1777 up to 1786) heinduced Elagin ‘ to read the books which he had earlier disdained as stupid’91.In Elagin’ s archive, one can find various MSs related to von Reuchel. In ouropinion, von Reuchel facilitated Elagin’ s interest in “ secret knowledge” , in-cluding Kabbalah; but this interest developed to the full extent due to his ac-quaintance with another mentor.86Ibid.87‘ Reuchel was sent in Russia by the National Lodge of Berlin (working after Zinnendorf ’ sSystem) “ to break the absolutism of Englishmen” . He headed in Russia the so-called “ Reuchel’ s”masonic system.

The gentleman spoken of is a certain Stanislaus Pines Eli (or Ely)who, in the words of Elagin, ‘ was an expert in our science, in the art of healing,and in Hebrew and Kabbalah’ . For many years, Eli taught him ‘ everythingwhat is necessary and needful for comprehension of mystical sense and out-landish sayings which are so plenty in the writings of Moses and other proph-ets’.92 Considering the name of this man, and his knowledge of Hebrew andKabbalah, we may suggest that he was a converted Jew. He was a native ofKolin (Bohemia) who received medical education at Berlin and Frankfurt-am-Oder. In 1778 (or 1776)93 Eli arrived in St. Petersburg where he got a certifi-cate for medical practice94. About that time he met Elagin and became hismentor. He also was able to cure his pupil from a fatal illness.Elagin reported that Eli was the author of a masonic book Fraternal Admo-nitions to Some Brethern Free Masons written by Br . Seddag (Bratskiye uve-shchaniya k nekotorim brat’ yam svbdn kmnshchkm. Pisani bratom Sedda-gom)95. In Pypin’ s opinion, this book was ‘ a typical example of Rosicruciannonsense, with its false depth and theological and alchemical inventions’96. Itwas very popular among Moscow Rosicrucians. It is written in symbolic andrather abstruse language and contains some elements that may definitely relateto Jewish mysticism. Thus one finds there a lengthy discourse on the greatmystical power of the Tetragrammaton, with its numerical interpretation. Theauthor also teaches his Brothers how to study the Scriptures in a specific “ kab-balistic” way:Read, my brother, read the Holy Creation, read its gradual consequences, read itby the clear inner eye ‘ of sages whose eye is in their head’ as overwise Solomon92RSAAA, F . 8, N 216, Pt. 3, f. 8r.

In 1786 Eliwas appointed (probably with a help of Elagin) to the position of head of theEconomic Chancellery at the Medical Board; he was also a member of theFree Economic Society99.This is almost all the information available about Dr. Eli who appears to beone of the most important figures relevant for our topic.Kabbalistic studies of ElaginWe can estimate the results of Elagin’ s kabbalistic studies by the content of hismanuscript collection, and especially by two of his own works. He planned towrite a large composition devoted to the history of masonry and mystical doc-trines from ancient times up to the end of the 18th century: Doctrine of ancientphilosophy and divine knowledge, or knowledge of Free Masons and diversemakers, profane, ecclesiastic, and mystic, collected and presented in fiveparts by I.E., the Grand Master of the Russian provincial lodge100. He beganto write the book in 1786 but two years later, in 1788, he had finished only apart of what he planned101. Thus we must judge about his design taken in itsentirety by an extant project. It is noteworthy that in the project (in the 2ndbook) there were a chapter 3 titled About T almud and T argum, chapter 5About kabbalistic Art. On Sefirot, on the Names of God, and chapter 10 Aboutthe 32 grades and the 50 gates for the great wisdom102. In the course of workthe project was, however, changed significantly.

The 4thbook that was devoted to the 5th–7th degrees is missing, and only some sketchesdevoted to “ the confirmation of the Existence of God and Incarnation” remainof the 5th book103. In the available MS, there are, in particular, twelve pages alldevoted to the interpretation of Hebrew words.

The text represents an extensive kabbalistic com-mentary to the main points of the masonic doctrine: God and Creation, ele-ments and Divine names, etc. On the basis of Holy Scripture – using thekabbalistic concepts Ein-Sof, emanation of the Sefirot, Adam Kadmon, fourworlds-Olamot, as well as the hermeneutic techniques of gematria, notarikon,and temurah – Elagin developed a kabbalistic version of the masonic cos-mogony. This composition is especially interesting for another reason: one cansee here a discerning and decoding of the kabbalistic subtext in the book DesErreurs et de la Vé rité (Lyon 1775) by Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin which isabsolutely unclear for uninitiated readers. T he kabbalistic and non-Christianinterpretation of the New Testament in Elagin’ s text appears to be especiallystrange. Thus Elagin treats Jesus Christ as the perennial man, Adam Kadmon,whilst he looks upon the historical Jesus from Nazareth as a mason and one ofthe “ hieroglyphs” , or “ effective images” of the Perennial Jesus.Elagin is an outstanding phenomenon that shows to us how strong was theinterest in Kabbalah among educated Russian people in the late 18th century.Though he was a prominent statesman and Orthodox Christian, he devotedmost of his life to the study of a tradition that seemingly was very distant fromthe Russian life of that time.

The tradition of perception, inter-pretation, and transmission of kabbalistic texts established by these peopleexisted for almost a century and a half, from the 1770s through the 1920s.They translated a truly great number of writings of European mystics, alche-mists, natural philosophers, and Christian kabbalists: all in all, hundreds ofvolumes. In addition, they created many original mystical texts. When ma-sonry was prohibited in Russia in 1822, masonic activity continued, but with-out the Lodges; and only after the communist revolution did it completelycease.The great bulk of the texts were composed in the late 18th - early 19th centu-ries in the circle of Moscow “ theorists” (or “ theoretical masons” ). The mostprominent members of the group were Johann Schwarz, Nikolay Novikov,Semion Gamaleya (1743-1822), Nikolay Trubetskoi, and, in the early 19th cen-tury, Joseph A. Pozdeev (1746-1820), Ruf S. Stepanov (1745-1828) etc.These people were members of the Order of Gold and Rosy Cross and hadhigher masonic degrees known as the Theoretical Degree of the Solomon Sci-ences and Rosicrucian degrees. Most of the texts available now were kept inthe collection of a masonic “ dynasty” Arsenievs (DMS RSL, F 13-14 – V .S.Arseniev’ s stock) which included a considerable part of the manuscripts be-longing to the Moscow “ theorists”106. It should be noted that the Arsenievs notonly kept the old MSs: during the whole 19th century these texts were continu-ously studied and commented, and new translations and original works wereadded to this Library.105On this Order see also Vernadsky, Russian Masonry in the Reign of Catherine the Great,102-120; Tukalevsky, ‘ N.

Lopukhin (1756-1816) as well as people possessing an extraordinary spiritual authority (thoughthey might have no special social status), such as Semion Gamaleya107. Theiractivity was concentrated around Moscow University, the biggest Moscowpublishing houses and printers, and magazines. All these people differed fromeach other in many respects but were united due to the rite of Rosicrucianinitiation.The Rosicrucian hierarchy was divided into nine stages, or “ degrees” . Thefirst one, an introductory “ Junior” degree, followed immediately the fourthdegree of regular masonry (“ Scottish Master” ). Then came the “ Theoreticus”(the “ Theoretic degree of Solomon Sciences” ), and everybody who attainedthis degree became a Rosicrucian. The next seven degrees were named thehigher degrees108. It is known that in Russia only about two dozen people pos-sessed these higher degrees. The most advanced among them were J. Schwarz,G . Schrö der, N. Novikov and N. Trubetskoi109. Each degree implied study ofcertain secret sciences and some practical activity (in the field of magic,theurgy, alchemy, etc.). In the seventh degree, Adeptus exemptus, initiates gotfamiliar with the stone of wisdom, Kabbalah, and natural magic; those whoattained the ninth degree (Magus) ‘ knew everything and mastered everythinglike Moses, Aaron, Hermes’110.

The content of masonic archives,and translations of kabbalistic texts as well as original compositions of Rus-sian masons devoted to Kabbalah which we discovered in the archives areindicative of their deep acquaintance with this tradition. It seems obvious thatthey tried to use their knowledge in practice, though they themselves tried tolook like “ pure” theorists. As a scholar noted, ‘ the Brothers of Gold and RoseCross were selected among the selected. The Rosicrucians strove to reach asuper-natural state, to converse with God, to invoke spirits, to command themand having known all the secrets of the nature, to become the lords of theirown destiny [...] Many Rosicrucians bore witness that it is impossible to de-scribe the blissful and immortal state of body into which they sunk when striv-ing to attain an ecstatic experience’112.Johann SchwarzLet us consider in detail an outstanding figure, Johann G . Schwarz (1751-1784)113 who was the founder of Moscow branch of the Order and the spiritualleader and preceptor of Russian masons. He was one of a few Brothers who111For example Semeka suggested that ‘ Russian Rosicrucians did not carry out alchemicexperiments because they did not go beyond the “ Theoretic Degree of the Solomon Sciences” ’ .See Semeka, ‘ Russian Rosicrucians and the works by Catherine II against Masonry’ , 365-366.This sceptical view is based mainly on the confessions of masons themselves made during ex-aminations.

The lodges re-mained and were reopened but existed secretly and were in fact illegal. T hemost interesting among them was “ the Lodge of Neptune” opened in Moscowin 1798. Its members continued Rosicrucian activity, read and translated theworks of European mystics, and collected a great library of mystical books121.At the beginning of the 19th century, some small circles of “ theorists” func-tioned in St. Petersburg (under the guidance of A.F. Labzin) and in Moscow(guided by I.A. Pozdeev)122. Even after the official legalization of masonicactivity in 1803, they continued to work inconspicuously. Taking into consid-eration the extant part of Pozdeev’ s library, the members of his lodge had inter-est in Kabbalah. In this collection, there are some kabbalistic books that be-longed formerly to the voluminous library of a mason Ivan Filatyev.An interesting mystical Illuminati society “ T he New Israel” (or “ The Peo-ple of God” ) was founded in 1785 by a Polish nobleman Tadeusz (Thaddeus)Leszczyc-Grabianka (1740-1807) at Avignon and moved in the early 19th cen-tury to St. Petersburg123.

Among the members were almost all eminent Russian Rosi-crucians; they predicted that ‘ by God’ s order, the Second and near Advent ofour Lord Jesus Christ, and His glorious reign on the earth’ would occur in1835. A select part of the members of the society constituted a “ Council ofProphets” and had “ correspondence with heaven”124. The prophesies were ac-complished in an ecstatic state, and the preparation to this experience requiredkeeping the fast and solitude. Grabianka, the “ King of the New Israel” , isknown to have had a keen interest in Jewish mysticism; he was a pupil of theabbé Louis-Philibert de Morveau (Brumore) (?-1786), a famous mason, alche-mist and kabbalist, ‘ a wiseman “ who had a voice [i.e. the gift of prophecy]”through the science of numbers, or Kabbalah’125. M.

His prediction of the Second Advent was prob-ably based on these “ computations”127.Another outstanding figure within masonry of the early 19th century wasJohann A.

At the same time, the number of people who were involved in thisactivity was rather small, hardly exceeding 80 members131. In addition, some“ theoretic” masons belonged to the “ interior” Rosicrucian Order, whose meet-ings occurred four times a year132.The meetings did not include any rites (except for initiation ceremonies);the Brothers were occupied with reading mystical works and commenting onthem. All their activity was directed to self-correction and restoration of theprimeval pure nature in the soul.They continued to pay special attention to translations of various works onmysticism, alchemy and Kabbalah. In particular, in the MSs collection ofArseniev’ s family there are several very important compositions written in the40s– 50s of the 19th century ‘ by the hand of A.A. Filosofov’133. In all probability,the author had a knowledge of Hebrew; his notes on Hebrew, and mysticalmeaning of Hebrew letters are indicative of his acquaintance with the language.Within his papers we find a relatively correct translation of Sefer Y ezirah, somefragments of Sefer ha-Zohar, Sefer ha-Temunah, and other kabbalistic texts.At the same time, “ theoretical” masons continued their public activity andcherished plans of social and moral amendment in Russia. In the mid 19th cen-tury, their main bases were Moscow University, Moscow governor generalChancellery, Moscow and Tula Clubs of the nobility, and Moscow depart-ments of the Senate.

The Society became a stronghold of Russian liberalnoblemen, whose belief in social reforms was based on the masonic outlook.These people had a certain influence on the abolition of serfdom in 1861135. Itis noteworthy that one of the main proponents of the reform was S.S.

Healso founded The Agricultural Magazine (Zemlyedel’ cheskiy Zhurnal) wherehis ‘ translations [of the articles] on agricultural problems’ were printed. At thesame time, Maslov translated into Russian the fundamental work Philosophieder Geschichte oder ü ber die Tradition (Philosophy of History, or On Tradi-tion) by Christian kabbalist F .J.

It is noteworthy thatMolitor had a high masonic degree and was historiographer of the masonicOrder of the Asiatic Brethren which was tightly connected with the Rosicru-cian movement. The doctrine and rites of this Order are known to be deeplyinfluenced by kabbalistic and Frankist ideology139. Molitor’ s bulky work isdevoted to a detailed analysis of Christianity and Judaism and a comparisonbetween Jewish and Christian mysticism. In G . Scholem’ s opinion, Molitorwas the last Christian kabbalist who had a deep comprehension of the Jewishmystical tradition, ‘ he revealed [...] an insight into the world of Kabbalah farsuperior to that of most Jewish scholars of his time’140. Molitor’ s book alsohad an essential effect on the views of Scholem himself141. It is remarkable135Serkov, The History of Russian Masonry in the 19th century, 2760-2777, 279-280.136Count Sergey S.

Regular meet-ings continued up to the 1870s, and the last case of reception occurred in early20th century when V .S.

They looked onKabbalah as a tradition that preserved invaluable grains of ancient wisdom,true knowledge which had been granted to mankind through revelation. Inaddition, Kabbalah, pari passu with Magic and Alchemy, was an integral partof the masonic doctrine. It elucidated the structure of divine and terrestrialworlds and the relationship between them, and assisted in revealing the hiddensense of the Scriptures. Moreover, masonic enthusiasm for Kabbalah wasaimed at rather practical purposes. Kabbalistic concepts of the universal man(Adam Kadmon) and global improvement (tikkun ha-olam) served as an ideo-logical basis for the masonic program of radical reformation of social, politi-cal, moral and religious conditions in Russia.It is known that the masonic teaching, in general, and its kabbalistic ele-ments, in particular, played a significant role in Russian literature, and not onlyin the writings of “ masonic” authors like M. Kheraskov and S. Bobrov but alsoin the work of V . Odoyevski, N. Gogol, A. Stepanov, D. Begichev, etc.145.142Molitor’ s ideas were circulated not only in masonic circles; among his readers was, e.g., aRussian writer and Romanticist V . F. Odoyevski. See Catalogue of V .F .

T hus, social and politic concepts of mystical masonry be-came an ideological basis for 18th century Russian conservatism. In the early19th century when rationalist masonry was expanded anew, the Rosicrucianstypified the conservative ideals. T heir religious and political views exerted agreat influence on the development of Russian Romantic philosophy and so-cial utopianism in the first half of the 19th century as well as of the Slavophilemovement146. Obviously enough, these ideas remained very important in Rus-sian religious philosophy of the late 19th-early 20th centuries (V . Soloviev, S.Bulgakov, P . Florenski, N. Berdyaev)147.

Jahrhunderts zu erforschen. Die Untersu-chung ist auf die groß e Menge der Handschriften die sich in russischen Archiven befinden undauf die wenig bekannten V erö ffentlichungen in russischen freimaurerischen Zeitschriften be-grü ndet. Die russische Freimaurerei war augenscheinlich die einfluß reichste geistige, gesell-schaftliche und politische Kraft am Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts. Die synkretische freimaurerischeLehre kombinierte die Elemente von verschiedenen religiö sen und esoterischen Traditionen, dar-unter waren die jü dische Kabbala und ihre christlichen Auslegungen. Der Artikel analysiertkabbalistische Ä uß erungen in der Lehre der freimaurerischen Logen und geheimen Orden. DieEntstehung der russischen Logen und ihrer Verbindungen mit den geheimen Gesellschaften inEuropa betrachtend, versuchen die Autoren die wichtigsten esoterischen Strö mungen am Endesdes 18. Jahrhunderts, die die russischen Brü der (vor allem, Rosenkreuzer und Martinisten) zumErlernen der Kabbala trieben, zu ermitteln. Die russischen Rosenkreuzer waren die hauptsä chli-chen Anhä nger der Kabbala. Sie haben den Hauptanteil der kabbalistischen Texte ü bersetzt. Undviele Werke, unter Verwendung jü disch-mystischer Konzepte, geschrieben. Alle diese Texte sindunverö ffentlicht und sind nur als Handschriften vorhanden.Es wird argumentiert, daß das Interesse der russischen Freimaurer am jü dischen Mysticismusnicht oberflä chlich war. Sie betrachteten die Kabbala als eine Tradition, die unschä tzbare Samender uralten Weisheit bewahrt hatte – Wissen das der Menschheit durch Offenbarung geschenktworden war. Auß erdem war die Kabbala, wie Magie und Alchemie, ein Bestandteil der freimau-rerischen Lehre. Sie erklä rte den Aufbau der gö ttlichen und irdischen Welten und ihrer Bezie-hungen, und sie half den verborgenen Sinn der heiligen Schrift zu enthü llen. Die freimaurerischeBegeisterung fü r die Kabbala hatte auch eine praktische Richtung. Die kabbalistischen Konzep-tionen der universellen Menschheit (Adam Kadmon) und der allgemeinen V erbesserung (tikkunha-olam) waren ideologische Grundlagen des freimaurerischen Programms zur radikalen Refor-mation des gesellschaftlichen, politischen, moralischen und religiö sen Lebens in Ruß land."}]
