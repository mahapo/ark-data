Whilst not a central figure in Deleuze and Guattari’s work, thesorcerer and the witch are themes that do crop up in their texts more oftenthan might be expected, and play more than a simply ‘metaphorical’ role.I think that Deleuze and Guattari can provide a resource for those interestedin sorcery, magic and witchcraft in two ways: firstly they can providetheoretical tools which can challenge or at least complement structuralist,constructivist and historicist accounts and so can be of use to researchersattempting to understand these phenomena; secondly, they can provide atheoretical resource for those within the magical community who at timesattempt to theorise their practise with what are essentially philosophicalconcepts."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 103Series, structure and anomalyGilles Deleuze died in 1995, committing suicide through defenestration afterhaving endured considerable physical difficulty with breathing. He waspart of the French post-structuralist movement that consists of figures suchas Lyotard, Foucault, Derrida and Lacan. He was always, however, aslightly oblique figure, never quite following the same lines of thought as hiscontemporaries. Like all the post-structuralists, he shared a concern withKant, Hegel and Nietzsche but unlike his contemporaries Deleuze took hisinspiration not only from Nietzsche but also from Hume, Spinoza andBergson as well as numerous people ‘outside’ philosophy such as GregoryBateson.One of the driving forces of the ‘post-structuralist’ movement in philosophywas a ‘theoretical anti-humanism’.2 This anti-humanism placed itself inopposition to any thought that centred on Man as the primary analyticalcategory. Deleuze’s particular contribution focussed on developing conceptsof ‘immanence’ and ‘difference’ which put forward a univocal ontology –that is, which put forward a unified being, a thought of life that has no‘outside’ or ‘duality’ but which contains within itself its own means ofdevelopment. This univocal universe is full of flux and becoming, a constantlyshifting ocean of change. The role of Bergson in Deleuze’s thought is togive him the means to make this ‘univocal ontology’ move and evolve; theideas of a vitalism which can be found within Bergson’s CreativeEvolution, for example, play a critical role for Deleuze3because theyprovide an organic model of the universe that corresponds to thephilosophical ontology. John Marks has also noted that in Deleuze’s work,vitalism is a way of connecting with, of being in the presenceof, this pre-individual world of flux and becoming4and thus vitalism forms a way of both modelling the universe as a universeof becoming that allows the creation of a way of thinking that enables us tounderstand this constant flux."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"104 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1Vitalism is still, as it were, a model. It is an interpretation or account andthere is then the problem of what a concrete vitalism of thought and lifewould mean. To this end Deleuze uses a concept of ‘desire’ as the namefor the flow, which includes the flow through us. Desire, crucially, is not adesire for anything that is lacking, as in Freud, Hegel and Lacan.5 Desireis a constituting activity of becoming; it is the individual current within theoceanic mass. In this essay, looking specifically at the practices of thesorcerer and their becomings, the streams of desire are something that thesorcerer will ‘plug into’. ‘Becoming begins as a desire to escape bodilylimitation’ 6 according to Brian Massumi and whilst this does notcharacterise all becoming it points to the practices of the sorcerer withwhich this essay is concerned.Having sketched out the twin concepts of vitalism and desire in terms oftheir role within this essay I want to now turn to one of Deleuze’s lateworks, written alongside the radical ‘anti-psychiatrist’ Felix Guattari, inorder to explore becoming in more detail. Early in the nineteen-seventies,Deleuze and Guattari had begun work on a two part work called Capitalismand Schizophrenia, the first part of which was Anti-Oedipus, where theconcept of desire is most apparent.7 The second part of Capitalism andSchizophrenia, not published until the nineteen-eighties, was called AThousand Plateaus. I want to discuss 3 subsections of the tenth chapterof A Thousand Plateaus that go under the heading, memories of asorcerer.8 I will first sketch a little of their context.The three sections come within a chapter titled 1730: Becoming-Intense,Becoming-Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible ... which consists of 14subsections, the first twelve of which are subtitled ‘memories of...’something.The chapter begins with a discussion that quickly leads to a distinctionbetween series and structure. This distinction is between two differentforms of analogy. Analogy is divided between analogy of proportion andanalogy of proportionality, the first being the analogy of the series and thelatter that of the structure. The analogy of proportion is of the form ‘a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 105resembles b, b resembles c, ...’ and as such posits a first term from whichresemblance originates, ‘a single eminent term, perfection or quality asthe principle behind the series’.9 The analogy of proportionality is of theform ‘a is to b as c is to d’. In this form of analogy there is no single seriesbut rather a set of differences distributed across structures. The structureof ‘a to b’ and the structure ‘c to d’ and it is the differences between theelements that form the basis of an analogy. Whilst this may seem an obscurephilosophical distinction it in fact represents two radically different forms ofmapping the world. The first analogical structure of the series is assigned,as an example, to Jung and the notion of archetypes as analogicalrepresentations.10 In contrast with Jung the next figure in the text is Levi-Strauss, whose analysis of totemism brings forward, according to Deleuzeand Guattari, a system of internal homologies rather than externalresemblances. What fundamentally shifts when employing one form ofanalogy or another is the emphasis in the analysis and understanding of theforms under observation. In the former case we attempt to observe relationsof identification or identity between terms, whether a resembles b andperhaps, through a series of steps, whether we can connect a to z. In thecase of the structural approach we examine not the terms in themselves butrather the relations between terms. It is precisely this method that wewould employ if we were to approach the translation of a symbolic systemwe thought of as an unknown language. The alphabetical series of a languagewould be constructed through discovery of internal homologies, which wouldbegin to assign positions within the system to the elements based upon theexisting knowledge of known languages.These two systems, of series and structure, offer modes of becoming. Tounderstand this, first think of the distinction between a difference in kindand a difference of degree. A difference in kind poses a break betweenthe differentiated elements, forming different sorts of things. A differencein degree poses a difference between elements within a kind, measurableaccording to a unified criterion. There are, for example, differences ofdegree between temperatures but differences in kind between temperaturesand pressures even though these two structures can be brought into formulaicrelation under the laws of physics. The first system we are looking at then,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"106 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1of a series based upon resemblance, offers a basic ontology of continuity,with differences organised according to degree; whereas the second system,of structural relations, posits a pluralistic or regional ontology with differencesof kind, in particular between ‘Man and Animal’. In passing, however, wecan note two ways in which these analogies might organise an understandingof magic. In terms of a series, whose pre-eminent term might be rationalcontrol of nature or something along those lines, we could argue that magicresembles science in its attempts to establish control or understanding ofnature. Its resemblance is such that magic might be said to be ‘lower’ inform than science but might be assimilated into the history of science as apre-cursor in a process aiming at the same goal. It would thus be broughtwithin a ‘historical series’ that posited a particular goal or end point toprogress. Alternatively we might say that magic plays a structurally identicalrole to science within a particular society, operating as a sort of technologythat we understand as different from, but again assimilable to, our ownculture. The first account would be one of series, the second one an accountof structures.Deleuze and Guattari, however, suggest that the two forms of structureand series both ignore or reject something fundamental, which can be namedas the anomalous. In particular, whilst these two forms of understandingmay well prove useful, Deleuze and Guattari asks whetherthere is still room for something else, something more secret,more subterranean: the sorcerer and becomings(expressed in tales instead of myths or rites)?11The sorcerer is introduced at this point as the figure of the anomaly. Thiscan be perceived as simply a metaphorical use of the term ‘sorcerer’ andwhilst a metaphorical use is indeed part of what is going on, ‘metaphor’ isa poor word to describe what Deleuze and Guattari are doing. Theirmethod is to use ‘conceptual personae’ to express concepts, figures throughwhich a philosophical concept is described and ‘diagrammed’.12 Thesorcerer is central to their thought as just such a conceptual persona."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 107The figure of the sorcerer is introduced alongside what are called ‘blocksof becoming’, which are these anomalous events indicated by the date inthe title of the chapter, 1730. ‘From 1730 to 1735, all we hear aboutare vampires’ .13 This is an example for Deleuze and Guattari of the blocksof becomings. These blocks of becomings are not fixed points from whichsomething becomes something else - this is the central aspect of theirargument. The blocks of becomings in this particular instance are whatDeleuze and Guattari will call ‘becoming-animal’.The role of the animal within Shamanic practice and as an aspect of thesorcerer’s art is indisputable in its existence if not in its exact function.Brian Bates, in his attempt to reconstruct an ‘indigenous’ neo-Shamanicpractice of the British Isles, cites an example of ‘animal workings’. He firstsuggests, using the divinatory role of the crow as an example, that therewas a central role for animals within the worldview of the Anglo-Saxonworld of the first millennium and from which he is drawing his inspiration.14After a brief ‘universalist’ move in which he suggests other morecontemporary indigenous cultures also have a clear role for animals withShamanic practice,15 he then suggests that there is an inherent alienation inthe way in which we have divorced ourselves from animals and asks howwe might work to ‘re-establish a degree of connection, identification,respect and even a sense of the sacred presence of animals’ .16 Batesis not unaware of the problem of ‘pretence’ in any attempt to work with‘finding a power animal’, that is, establishing some sort of sacred or magical-Shamanic link with an animal. As he says,done superficially it simply confirms our casual attitudetowards the animal world, and our propensity to use animalslike a psychological fast-food dispenser: instant guardiananimal.17What Bates carries out is a six-month long program of meditation, imaginalactivity, visualisation and practical association. The critical climax of Bates’account comes when he describes a session in which a participant isassociating with a bear. She is engaged in what Deleuze and Guattari call"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"108 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1a ‘becoming’, in this instance a ‘becoming-bear’. Bates says,when she walked into the room, on all fours, and then satback on her haunches, she was a bear ... her ‘performance’transcended mimicry; it was much more than the sum of itsparts.18Bates’ account makes a claim to a transcendence of mimicry. This opensup the problem of the ‘reality’ of the situation as well as the problem of ourbelief in this reality. Was she really, in any sense, a bear? The issue ofbelief and truth is still embedded within studies of shamanism and to a largeextent is always posed when looking at magical practice rather than thehistory or theory of magical texts. Alan T. Campbell draws on a distinctionfrom the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre when approaching this issue.MacIntyre, he says, distinguishes between understanding and belief,making the point that an effort of understanding has inevitablyto be made from the outside. If you’re already a ‘believer’there’s no ‘understanding’ effort required. It’s becausewe don’t believe that we have to make the interpretativeeffort.19MacIntyre’s distinction is made in the context of Christian religion and inthe tradition of ‘rational theology’ but it echoes a sceptical problemarticulated very simply in a distinction drawn by Wittgenstein: ‘The gameof doubting itself presupposes certainty’ .20 The whole game ofquestioning reality, if taken as a game of doubting, puts the issue of belief inthe foreground. This is the sceptical cul-de-sac. To begin from a positionin which disbelief in the phenomena prompts an attempt to understand it isto engage in a form of delusion itself, to cover over our own presuppositionscontained in the worldview within which we are inevitably – always, already- situated. Issues of belief and the reality of the phenomena will rapidly fallinto the dichotomy of the believer/understander, the insider/outside. Wewill find ourselves in an endless ramified series of questions about whetherit is real, whether it be spirits, magic or the sorcerer’s practice itself. These"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 109are, in many ways, false problems.The task is not to question whether what is happening is real, is out there,a ‘fact’ or objective thing, but to pursue further the question of ‘what ishappening’. The serial/structural models might aid in one way in culturaland historical analysis, but I have already suggested that Deleuze andGuattari argue that these will avoid the anomalous, precisely those eventswhich seem the most ‘unreal’. It is as a ‘strategy of understanding’ that thenotion of a block of becoming might prove useful. The analysis of theseblocks of becoming, as they pose them, have no beginning point or endpoint and thus no substantive realities or objects whose reality status needsassigning. It the wrong question to ask whether the woman is in fact abear, since this simply confuses the block of becoming, in this case abecoming-bear, with the reality or object that we might call ‘bear’ within adifferent context.‘Becoming is never imitating’ .21Blocks of becoming and the role of the packThe blocks of becoming produce no end result. We do not engage in abecoming-animal in order to end up as an animal, even temporarily, or inthe imagination, or on a spiritual level. The blocks of becoming producenothing other than themselves, neither belonging to a subject (I become...)nor ending in an object (... a bear). This is the first claim; ‘Becomingproduces nothing other than itself ’.22 What then are these blocks ofbecoming? They are processes and activities, but they are not of theimagination, nor are they phantasies, rather they are real in themselves,‘perfectly real’.23 It is not a question of imitation because this simply avoidsthe matter of the becoming itself. We must stay with the phenomena andnot assume its reality somehow depends on anything outside itself, either asubject or a term. This is the second claim, ‘the principle according towhich there is a reality specific to becoming’ .24 Finally, becomings donot operate through ‘filiation’, that is, they cannot claim some sort of seriallink to an object or image which they resemble either more or less. Rather"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"110 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1there is another process that is in play, a process of alliance. It is not amatter of ‘establishing corresponding relations’ 25 such as themacrocosm-microcosm model, but is carried out by a form of folding activity,in which connections, networks of involvement and intertwining are themethods in an activity that is not an evolution but rather what Deleuze callsan involution: ‘Becoming is involutionary, involution is creative’.26 Threeclaims are evident then; (1) becomings produce only themselves, (2)becomings are perfectly real and (3) becoming is an involutionary and thuscreative process.This is the background to the three sections of the tenth chapter of AThousand Plateaus, the rough outline of the route up to the Memories ofa Sorcerer sub-sections and I want to now look at the figure of the sorcererwithin these sub-sections. Certain aspects of the text will have to be passedover, notably certain particular formulations that would involve me in a fartoo slow and detailed reading taking me beyond the subject of this essay.One of these tropes or formations within the text is worth noting, however,and that is the way in which they identify with the sorcerer. They use thephrase ‘we sorcerers’ in critical places within the text; in the first ‘memory’,where they identify a type of knowledge, in the second memory wherethey deal with a contradiction and in the third ‘memory’ where they identifya particular practice or method.27 They also use the phrase ‘fellow sorcerers’in the first memory when describing their ‘way’.28 It is worth bearing theseidentifications in mind in the following account of the argument within thesections under question.We begin, we sorcerers, with the pack, Deleuze and Guattari argue. ‘Abecoming-animal always involves a pack, a band, a peopling, in short,a multiplicity’ .29 This is one of the first principles of much of their thought,this notion of a multiplicity, which differs from a multiple in that a multiplicityis singular and not composed of simply numerable elements. A multiplicityis, albeit slightly simplistically, a whole greater than its parts. This must beunderstood quite literally, in the sense of packs, swarms, shoals and mobsor crowds where an animal might be said to take on a different form fromthe more common model of the individual particular; the specific animal is,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 111in this sense, transcended or gone beyond when in a pack mode. Cruciallythe pack is not some sort of stage within an evolution, which is why Ispecifically mentioned crowds and mobs. For Deleuze and Guattari ‘everyanimal is fundamentally a band, a pack’ .30 The distinction that is beingmotivated is in terms of understanding animals in terms of modes ofmultiplicity not simply characteristics of the multiple. It is in terms ofthese modes that we encounter the animal.At this point the argument draws on an example from H.P. Lovecraft andhis story of Randolph Carter in Through the gates of the silver key.Deleuze and Guattari, calling this one of Lovecraft’s masterpieces, recounta passage from section 4 of the story, where a multiplicity of RandolphCarters come pouring forth.31 Just before the passage quoted we findLovecraft describing Randolph Carter’s realisation as he passes throughthe ‘Ultimate Gate’. ‘Now, beyond the Ultimate Gateway, he realisedin a moment of consuming fright that he was not one person, butmany persons’.32 This passage, pointing explicitly to a notion of amultiplicity of selves, which would be understood as a mode of the humananimal, reveals something of the role of the becoming-animal within Deleuzeand Guattari’s philosophy. The ability to access this mode of multiplicity iswhat is meant by sorcery.What we see throughout A Thousand Plateaus is this entanglementbetween philosophical arguments and examples from fiction. Deleuze andGuattari draw heavily upon literature as a resource for their work. Is thesorcerer, then, simply another name for the writer? ‘If the writer is asorcerer, it is because writing is a becoming’ .33 Yet the becomings arenot a becoming something specific; they are not, for example, a becoming-writer. It is, rather, that the writers Deleuze and Guattari draw upon workwith the method of becoming that belongs pre-eminently to the figure ofthe sorcerer. In particular the writer and the sorcerer, the writer as sorcerer,work with ‘feelings of an unknown Nature’,34 called affects. This affectis a positive created force, a power that derives directly from the pack,from the mode of the animal as pack and which brings forth the multiplicitythat will throw ‘the self into upheaval and make it reel’.35"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"112 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1The first memory sub-section focuses, then, on the pack and the multiplicity.One danger might be to of think this pack in terms of tribe or filial communityand associated with the notion of pack goes a second characteristic or‘principle’.A multiplicity without the unity of an ancestor? It is quitesimple; everybody knows it, but it is discussed only in secret.We oppose epidemic to filiation, contagion to heredity. . 36The object at this point is to try and establish certain principles of methodand understanding and to break down or pose alternatives to ideas ofseries and structure, of lineages. The pack, as multiplicity, works on alevel of multiplicities, whereby it spreads through contagion. These twoprinciples form, for Deleuze and Guattari, the path that any becoming-animal will take. A counter-principle is next put forward or rather a counter-point, where each multiplicity will express the ‘exceptional individual’. Thiswill be the anomaly.Whilst every animal has a mode as pack and packs propagate throughcontagion, each pack will also contain its anomaly or anomalous point.Deleuze and Guattari are explicit in that this seems to pose a contradictionto the model they are putting forward of the process of becoming. If webegin from multiplicities then how can we logically reach a concept of the‘exceptional individual’? It is a contradiction to put forward both themultiplicity and the exceptional individual. ‘We sorcerers know quite wellthat the contradictions are real but that real contradictions are notjust for laughs’ .37 What is meant by the anomalous? It is first pointed toby again bringing in Lovecraft and his ‘Outsider’ or Thing, ‘teeming,seething, swelling, foaming, spreading like an infectious disease, thisnameless horror’.38 The exceptional individual is in fact not a specific,singular individual; Deleuze and Guattari explicitly proffer the term‘individual’ only to retract it as they develop their concept, putting forwardthe idea that this ‘individual’ is in fact the focus of the affects they earlierbrought into the discussion. This is why Lovecraft provides such a perfectexample of description in that the Thing, the nameless horror, whilst"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 113individuated and specifiable to a degree is not in any sense an ‘individual’with a sense of continuous self, nor even a physically specific identity.The anomalous accompanies each multiplicity and this anomalous is in factnothing other than the ‘phenomenon of bordering’ .39 The anomalous isthe specific point at which the pack is divided along a line, where an edgeis seen. The difficulty with this concept is that it includes both the situationof an alpha individual within a wolf pack and the situation of mosquitoes intheir swarm. There are, it is clear, very different forms of this anomalousindividual. It may be a specific animal that divides the pack into left andright, and the alpha wolf, with the pack streaming to the sides in somethingresembling a flight formation, is a strong image that might be drawn on inthis situation.We would see the same thing again in the swarming rats, flowing over thebanks and ditches of a woodland and James Herbert’s stories of The Ratsalways feature some sort of over-large, over-intelligent or over-viciousindividual that has taken the swarm into a new place, transforming theminto a murderous beast of many forms. Within the mosquito swarm, andperhaps the same with flocking birds, the position of the anomalous individualis constantly shifting and the specific individuals flow through this role ofthe anomalous individual in turn as they become the edge of the whole. Itis worth noting that there is no real hint of a leadership within this anomalyand at the point at which the anomalous is assigned to a position of hierarchy,as is the danger in the example of the wolf alpha structure, we find theconcept of the pack being transformed again into the state.40 It is thiscuriously difficult distinction in collectivities that Deleuze and Guattari areaiming at. The pack may become the state, the family, the group but initself is more than these more rigid structures; the pack is a mobile multiplicity,spreading through contagion and with a border formed through anomaly.The relation with the anomalous is one of alliance. Thesorcerer has a relation of alliance with the demon as thepower of the anomalous.41"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"114 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1At this point Deleuze and Guattari are attempting to locate the sorcererwithin this conceptual structure of multiplicities within which there is a clearand rather privileged place for the sorcerer. This world consists ofmultiplicities, what are called at other times aggregates, which might bevisualised as crowds, mobs, swarms or packs. There are many of these,at every level, from the cellular to the stellar, forming a vision of aninterlocking, chaotic soup of multiplicities. The primary form of‘communication’ and change or exchange between these multiplicities isvia contagion, through infection or transformation or the one multiplicity bythe other, across borderlines. These borderlines form a continuouslychanging series of edges, which trace out lines of rapid communicationfrom one area to another42 and it is in these borderlines that we find thesorcerer and where one must go to become a sorcerer. The borderlinesare the constant critical areas of becoming. The reason for alliance is thatthe borderline poses a need to be at once on both sides. To even knowthat the edge exists it is necessary to have stepped over but in such a waythat it is not simply forgotten. Moving from one aggregate to another,whilst it may involve a border crossing, will never produce awareness ofthe border except as a memory, almost a necessary memory. The allianceprovides the means by which the sorcerer is capable of living at the border,since it enables a relation with both sides that enables the border to actuallyexist as a becoming that is no longer reduced to its terms, to either one sideor the other, one thing or another.This analysis of the sorcerous sections of Deleuze and Guattari’s workneeds one final addition before moving on. The overall structure of theanalysis Deleuze and Guattari give is one that wants to retain the realitypeculiar to becomings. These realities are what Deleuze and Guattari callthe blocks of becoming. These blocks of becoming are multiplicities withinwider structures of borderline or liminal contagion. The blocks of becominghave no ‘beginning’ or ‘end’ point but their dynamics are, however, capableof being further understood as being between the molecular and the molar.These are not opposites within a single structure but differences in kind.As John Marks says,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 115the distinction between the molar and the molecular is not adistinction of scale; it is qualitative rather than quantitative43The molar is the level of the organised, where we might find the state,whereas the molecular is the realm of desires’ flux and flows. The tensiontouched upon above, where the pack might become the state, is preciselywhat happens when the pack becomes molar, organised and static, in effectceasing to be a pack. The multiplicity of the pack is a molecular multiplicity.Deleuze and Guattari do not provide simple models for analysis. Whatthey do provide is a concerted attempt to bring forward working modelsfor a mobile philosophy, a philosophy of becoming. As such they providea huge resource for the study of phenomena of change and transformation,such as the study of liminal phenomena, of which sorcery and shamanismare key examples. They attempt to provide a systematic way in which wemight study such phenomena, although the systems they attempt to establishare open systems. Deleuze argues in an earlier collection of interviewsa system’s a set of concepts. And it’s an open systemwhen the concepts relate to circumstances rather thanessences.44The anomalous becomings of sigilsThe concept of becomings, including becoming-animal, is only one conceptamongst the open system of Deleuze and Guattari’s work. Anotherfundamental concept, motivated primarily by Deleuze, is the emphasis on afully affirmative philosophy, one that breaks with the dialectic of Hegelianphilosophy, the central tool of which is the power of negation. Thisphilosophy of the affirmative that Deleuze and Guattari push forward might,with minor reservations, be said to be a Dionysian-Ariadnean philosophy.From this point connections with a sorcerer such as Spare can be tracedout, starting from the ‘point of transmutation or transvaluation’ 45 thatis central to this Nietzschean inspired affirmation of affirmation. One possibleway of thinking this connection is of two different dynamics coalescing"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"116 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1around this point of transmutation, one inspired by theory (the philosopher),the other by practice (the sorcerer).46Having given a brief and theoretical account of an element of the work ofDeleuze and Guattari I want then to turn to a specific example of magicalpractice in the form of the work of Austin Osman Spare. Spare has becomeincreasingly well known over the last few years because of his associationwith a form of sorcery that is known as ‘Chaos Magic’. Spare came intothe occult scene at the turn of the twentieth century, publishing his firstbook of text and illustrations, Earth Inferno, in 1905. He is reported tohave briefly become a member of Aleister Crowley’s magical order, theArgenteum Astrum (AA). Apparently Crowley made the comment‘Artist: can’t understand organisation’ 47 with regard to Spare, perhapsindicating a temperament unsuitable to the structures of the AA. Spare’sown comments on ceremonial magicians within The Book of Pleasurebetray a little more hostility to the ceremonial magics of Crowleyan andGolden Dawn traditions however:Others praise ceremonial magic, and are supposed to suffermuch ecstasy! Our asylums are crowded, the stage isoverrun! Is it by symbolising we become the symbolised?Were I to crown myself King, should I be King? Rathershould I become an object of disgust and pity. TheseMagicians, whose insincerity is their safety, are but theunemployed dandies of the Brothels.48The Book of Pleasure is perhaps Spare’s principal work and what isinteresting in the comment above, aside from the obvious hostility to aparticular form of magic, is the no less obvious methodological objectionto the role of symbol and symbolisation within magic. It is important todistinguish very clearly Spare’s form of sigilisation from any traditional notionof symbolism. There are a number of models that can be distinguished: asymbol can stand for something; it can point to something; it can containsomething or it can communicate something. In each situation the symbolis essentially an adjunct of ‘something’, which we might describe as its’"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 117meaning. In essence the symbol is not the meaning but rather has a meaningand the basic structure is one of being a medium or container for this essential,non-symbolic reality. William Gray, for example, asks after the nature of asymbol and says,in effect it is the good old ‘outward sign of inward grace’,or a practical link between objective and subjectiveexistence. It is a body containing a soul, matter holding ameaning, a focus of force, a condenser of consciousness ora ‘thought-tank 49To a large extent, of course, these accounts of the symbol as tool arepractical and true – we do, in fact, use symbols in exactly this way. Thisfactual use of symbols does not, however, imply that this is in principle theonly way symbols can be used. The fact that symbols are used as toolsdoes not imply that either they are tools or that they must be tools.Spare uses symbols in a way that is far closer to an artistic use of stroke orcolour. The paint stroke does not stand for, contain, transmit or somehowmake us able to see the real picture behind the strokes and colours but is infact the picture itself. This process is a manifestation or creation. It is anact itself, not a means. This active symbolisation disturbs the very conceptof symbols themselves, with a split in Spare’s work between ‘symbols’and ‘sigils’. In The Book of Pleasure Spare focuses explicitly on theconstruction of both symbols and sigils. It is in one of the sections on sigils,subtitled ‘the psychology of believing’, that we find the following: ‘We arenot the object by the perception, but by becoming it’ .50 This shift fromperception to becoming signals a connection with a Deleuzo-Guattarianphilosophy.It is worth, at this point, placing the techniques Spare motivates within TheBook of Pleasure inside the more general ‘metaphysical’ schema withwhich he operates. This centres on the two names KIA and ZOS, hencethe name of the Zos-Kia Cultus, the magical ‘current’ or ethos associatedwith Spare as well as with Kenneth Grant and later, via Peter Carroll’s"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"118 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1work, with the Illuminates of Thanateros, the central magical order in the‘Chaos Magic current’. Carroll suggests, in his work Liber Null,the twin functions of will and perception is called Kia bymagicians. Sometimes it is called spirit, or soul, or life force,instead 51He goes on to say of Kia that itis the consciousness, it is the elusive ‘I’ which confers self-awareness but does not seem to consist of anything itself.Kia can sometimes be felt as ecstasy or inspiration, but it isdeeply buried in the dualistic mind.52Magic, therefore, is for Carroll,concerned with giving the Kia more freedom and flexibilityand with providing means by which it can manifest its occultpower.53Now Carroll is writing a working grimoire or grammar of magic, focusedon a practical orientation, and as such his metaphysics is simply there toassist in the establishment of such a practical end. These comments onKia are little more than a pragmatic use of certain names that enable themagician to explain to the student the basics of their working activity. Forexample, the fact that Carroll says that ‘magicians’ use the name Kia is inmany ways disingenuous if you were looking for an accurate historicalreading, since Spare is the principle magician to initiate the term. Moreimportantly, though, Carroll’s metaphysic converts Kia into a force whichthe magician then harnesses or expresses through their activity, enablingthe new-comer to the field of magic to place their activity back withinsome sort of cause-effect paradigm, except this time one that relies uponthe great life-force Kia, rather the laws of physical nature.Spare, however, has a slightly more subtle and in many ways more interesting"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 119role for Kia within his work, particularly if the focus is maintained on TheBook of Pleasure. Within this text Kia, whilst possibly a ‘life force’ isperhaps more adequately described as life itself.Anterior to Heaven and Earth, in its aspect that transcendsthese, but not intelligence, it may be regarded as theprimordial sexual principle, the idea of pleasure in self-love.54This Kia, then, has numerous ‘aspects’, of which one is creativity itself,creation as process rather than object or product – Kia in this aspecttakes the place of any ‘creator’ and it is this removal of the role of thecreator that is central. Kia is self-manifesting. It is, in this regard, akin towhat Deleuze calls ‘difference’, which is not a difference from or betweenanything but which is immanence itself, not immanent to anything.55 This isa form of pantheism before theism, a self-moving universe, a vitalism.56The basic worldview or ontology of Spare relies upon a vitalism that isshared with Deleuze. Of course, this vitalism is something Deleuze picksup from thinkers such as Bergson and so the similarities extend beyondDeleuze and Guattari. It is, however, the connection of the vitalism withthe technique of a concrete embodiment of desire within the sigil that drawsSpare and Deleuze and Guattari closer still. Spare’s techniques arefundamentally techniques of becoming. The difference of emphasis that isfound when drawing Sparean Sigilisation towards Deleuzo-Guattarianbecoming is fundamentally away from the problem of belief. To focus ontechniques of becoming is to shift the emphasis away from simply ‘removing’beliefs into a more positive activity. The removal or dissolution of beliefs isstill a central theme in Spare, but work on belief structures is nothing morethan a pre-requisite for the techniques of becoming.The ‘primordial sexual principle’, for example, is what Spare refers to as‘the new sexuality’, which the technique of the ‘death posture’ is intendedto access. This is a form of meditation, both physical and mantrical, usingthe formula of ‘Neither-Neither’ to attain a state described as ‘Does notmatter – need not be’ which is formless.57 Called ‘the death posture’"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"120 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1because it aims to create ‘the dead body of all we believe’ 58 the intentionbehind this meditative practice is the removal of belief, both in content andform. Whilst the Chaos Magic current uses a technique called ‘paradigmshifting’59 in order to break down ego structures, this is often posed interms of a technique to break free from ‘consensual reality’. This technique,whilst practical, rests upon an apparent paradox, in that it seems that themagician believes in their ability to not believe and as Julian Vayne suggests,the Chaos Magick system rests upon a paradox. Namelythat the system claims that ‘nothing is true’ and yet itselfemerges from the 19th century attempt to create a grandtheory of magick.60In this sense Chaos Magic rests upon an attempt to negate or suspendbelief, an odd situation akin to philosophical scepticism. Philosophicalscepticism, however, has a number of forms, one of which is Pyrrhonism,elucidated by writers such as Sextus Empiricus, where the aim of thesceptical process is a condition of bliss known as ataraxia, which followsthe suspension of belief, known as epoche.61 This ataraxia is a state ofquietude. It allows a release from scepticism through pursuing it to its end,in such a way that the sceptical doubt that is so easily established withregard to knowledge claims no longer has its disorientating power to producea nihilism of belief. Whilst Spare’s work at times resembles a powerfulform of scepticism it would be rather strange to suggest that the aim is aform of quietude. In fact it would be more accurate to say that the techniquesSpare puts forward produce exactly the opposite of quietude, what mightbe called a form or orgiastic consciousness, which is this strange thing hecalls ‘the new sexuality’. This is an expanded and increased creativity, nota settled and contemplative quietude.Is this right, however, since Spare talks about the Kia as the ‘AtmosphericI’? Kenneth Grant reads Spare as close to a Ch’an or Zen likecontemplation, ‘the adepts of which do not permit the mind to adhereto any of its thoughts’.62 Although this is a claim that would needconsiderably more substantiation, my own feeling is that Spare’s magical"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 121philosophy may resemble a Taoist rather than a Buddhist, even a ZenBuddhist, approach, where the activity on belief is less a process of negationand deconstructing than a process of freeing up and allowing a full flow oflife. This is a subtle difference but may be said to be a question of whetherthe focus is on removing the ego and dissolving the self or whether it is onthe expression of a fuller pre-individual life, such that the question of theego or self is, in some ways, secondary, to the reality of manifesting anorgiastic consciousness.So long as the notion remains that there is ‘compulsorybondage’ in this World or even in dreams there is suchbondage.63The therapeutic approach that may be found within the Pyrrhonian scepticand which I would also suggest lies at the heart of ‘ego-negating’ strategiesperceives, in the first instance, a problem to be overcome, a problem ofthe ego, the self. Removing or destroying belief results in a form of nihilisticscepticism, provoking spiritual crises that once more call forth therapies ofquietude and acceptance. One of the key themes within Deleuzian thoughtis a struggle against such strategies of negation. The emphasis on strategiesand models of becoming presupposes a fluid structure to belief but doesn’tbelieve this to be anything other than a forerunner to a creative process.The struggle against belief is only necessary, after all, if belief restrictssomething and to forget what it is that is restricted, the impulse behind thestruggle against belief, is to end in the nihilism against which Nietzschewarned.For example, despite all the techniques that seem to deny belief in Spare’swork, contained within a formula of ‘Neither Neither’, this is not a negation.It is a subtle shifting away from any ‘belief’ but it does not allow any dualityto exist, no ‘not X’. It prevents negation with suspension, hence thesuggestion that it is in fact close to the epoche of the sceptics, a techniquewhich also lies at the heart of Edmund Husserl’s ‘phenomenology’ in whichthe epoche is used to suspend the ‘natural attitude’. Spare’s attitude tobelief is in fact an attempt to free it up, as it were, from restrictions placed"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"122 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1upon it by the consciousness, not an attempt to simply remove or deny it.64It is, in essence, a technique of allowing the becoming of belief. ‘Belief, tobe true, must be organic and sub-conscious’ .65It is to achieve this organic belief that the technique of sigilisation isintroduced. In effect the sigils are not symbols containing anything, butrather they are expressions in which we consciously carry out specificoperations in such a way as to allow an intuitive sub-conscious or pre-conscious desire to manifest. It re-orientates the sorcerer away from anego centred strategy since the magician is never, in principle, capable ofreally knowing their desire except on this sub-conscious level. This sub-conscious level is pre-individual. It is not beneath or below or createdthrough the ego or super-egoic structures but prior to and more fundamentalthan these. This is strongly akin to Deleuze’s account of consciousness asa ‘transcendental field’ that ‘can be distinguished from experience inthat it doesn’t refer to an object or belong to a subject’ .66 In itself thistranscendental field is nothing more than a ‘pure plane of immanence’ 67that is constituted as a transcendental field by the production of thetranscendent entity that is ‘consciousness’. The pure plane of immanence– the great ocean of becoming – cares nothing for consciousness and onlybecomes a ‘transcendental field’ when it produces consciousness as aneffect. Beneath all the currents of thought is the ocean from which theyarise and into which they fall back, an ocean of becoming that has noconcern with anything other than its own becoming.Consciousness in effect becomes a sort of self-defeating capacity when itis used to fulfil life; it is a detour, which we must consciously step backfrom. We, of course, have in principle no ability to know beforehand quitewhere or how this might be carried out – hence the need to employ anexperimental approach. Sigilisation marries a true experimentalism ofautomatic drawing with the conscious thought that ‘this X is our desire’,a desire no longer possessed by us but by which we are possessed. Spareis Deleuzian in the sense that he no longer wants a focus on the ‘magician’as controller, perceiver or creator. Sparean sorcery is a technique not ofego-dissolution but of practical experimentation with a pre-individual plane"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 123of immanence, the ocean of becoming.The Sigil being a vehicle, serves the purpose of protectingconsciousness from the direct manifestation of the(consciously unacknowledged) obsession, conflict isavoided with any incompatible ideas and neither gainsseparate personality68.Spare says, and it is this subtle fictionalisation process that is the true heartof the sigilisation process. What is anomalous in Spare’s sigilisation processis that it is a paradoxically conscious practice aimed at releasing the sub-conscious: it is, in effect, a deliberate attempt to consciously do somethingthat can’t be done consciously. It is an attempt to plug into the orgiasticconsciousness, the Sparean sub-conscious, in an experimental, structuredand repeatable operation.Molecularity and becomingAt this point I want to try and draw the threads of this essay together,through the notion of becoming as an experimentation. Deleuze and Guattariprovide a model through which we might approach becoming on its ownterms. This accomplishes, in a different manner, a similar goal to that putforward in Spare with regard to belief. This is a process of steppingoutside the problem of belief. Once this is done another positive problemcan be posed, the problem of creation and becoming. Deleuze and Spareshare two fundamental aspects in their positive thought and practice. Firstly,they both work with a model of a universe of becoming and secondly theyshare the attitude that the appropriate technique in such a world isexperimentation.In The Book of Pleasure we find a sort of ‘definition’ statement by Spare:Magic, the reduction of properties to simplicity, making themtransmutable to utilise them afresh by direction, withoutcapitalisation, bearing fruit many times.69"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"124 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1This is the process I have called ‘plugging into an orgiastic consciousness’,which makes fluid the concepts of matter, thought and being, in such away that limitations are little more than temporary boundaries of actuality,not possibility. It is both a practical and a theoretical process, one whichSpare calls ‘magic’ and which, in a Deleuzian vein we might call ‘makingthe difference’. Spare supposes the ‘properties of simplicity’ that Deleuzeand Guattari call the ‘molecularity’ of becoming. Magic in this readingwould therefore be a difference-making activity within a world of becomingcharacterised by the flux of fundamental simplicity or molecularity at theheart of the universe.The Deleuzo-Guattarian model of becoming gives us a structure throughwhich we might see this process of ‘plugging into’ the orgiastic consciousnessas the principal technique of the sorcerer. The multiplicity of multiplicities,all ever shifting, form the plane of activity but the border crossings arenever, in principle, predictable even if some may be more familiar thanothers – the role of drugs for example provides an unpredictable if familiarroute to crossing borders of consciousness. Drugs in fact provide a crucialexample of the way in which the practical thought of Deleuze and Guattaricould be used and is intended by them to be used. The famous maxim ofDeleuze and Guattari, which they take from Henry Miller, is that we shouldattempt ‘to succeed in getting drunk, but on pure water’ .70 The successof such a process rests upon the structures of becoming that are similar tothose underlying Spare’s attempts at creating organic beliefs throughsigilisation but both of these processes are techniques of experimentation.Deleuze and Guattari’s thought enable the sorceries of Spare to be retrievedfrom the linear arrangements made by someone like Kenneth Grant whowants to assimilate him to a particular magical current71 whilst allowingsuch suggestions to provoke an interesting series of connections. Theyalso offer a model of matter that no longer needs concepts such as ‘aether’to allow non-causal connections. It brings the role of the writer and theartist to the fore rather than the model of the mystic and promptsexperimentation and open structures rather than ideas of verification andinexpressible experientiality contained within assimilations of magic to"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 125science combined with the role of the secret. Magic is another form ofknowledge, often relying upon the secret of the inexpressible experience,but such an approach is in danger of forgetting the other side of activity,that in which ‘knowledge’ is an embodied, active process of experimentallearning. Any emphasis on an over-simple concept of knowledge will fallprey to the permanent danger of a debilitating scepticism. I have only beenable to give some very broad suggestions in this essay, but the purpose isto put forward a notion of another current within magical practice, one thatruns alongside all human activity; the activity of the experimental andanomalous becoming which may be found at the heart of any notion offreedom. As such magic – like philosophy - has less importance forknowledge than for an ethical practice of relations with the living."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"126 Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1Notes1 Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari worked together on a number of booksfrom the nineteen-seventies until the early nineties. Deleuze, already a wellknown philosopher, combined with Guattari, who was a psychiatrist/psycho-analyst, to produce a series of practical works which grow out of hisphilosophy but which owe to Guattari a very different style, form and tone.The works produced together are most often viewed as a single voice,with two authors, since a merging takes place in which each is recognisablebut neither is at any point easily distinguishable.2 Cf; Kate Soper, Humanism and anti-humanism, (London, Hutchinson,1986). Whilst Deleuze is notably absent from Soper’s account, this textdoes give a general background to the debates from the perspective of ahumanist Marxism. It thus provides a useful critical account of the‘theoretical anti humanists’ and ‘post structuralists’, written by an opponentof their thought.3 Cf; Keith Ansell Pearson, Germinal Life: the difference and repetitionof Deleuze, (London, Routledge, 1999) and Henri Bergson, CreativeEvolution, (New York, University Press of America, 1983).4 John Marks, Gilles Deleuze: vitalism and multiplicity, (London, PlutoPress, 1998) 315 Desire as a translation of the French desir is often connected with theFrench word delire, a word that is translated to the English ‘delirious’.For an excellent account of the intricacies of desire, delire, language andthought see Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Philosophy through the LookingGlass, (London, Hutchinson, 1985). As Lecercle says, delire may beunderstood as an experience of possession, a process that ‘reverses therelation of mastery’ (p.9) and it is this element of mastery that is troubledand questioned within Deleuze’s use of desire.6 Brian Massumi, A users guide to capitalism and schizophrenia:deviations form Deleuze and Guattari, (Cambridge, Mass., MIT, 1996),94.7 There is an important qualification to be made at this point since theconcept of desire is motivated in Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Journal for the Academic Study of Magic - Issue 1 127(London, Athlone, 1996) through the aggregate concept of ‘desiring-machine’.

The break that ‘chaos’ theory issupposedly making within scientific thinking does have its echo within‘magical’ theory and although nowhere near as clear as commonlysupposed, it focuses on this notion of immanent formation; that is, thatthere is no prior content which is then given particular form but that formitself arises spontaneously and is not separable from the content.Manuel De Landa has written extensively on this aspect of chaos theoryalthough there is another fundamental strain of such theory which focusesmore specifically on the implications of the theories of thermodynamicsand the fact that such theories posit a directional temporality that is noteasily dealt with in the theories of physics, be they classical or relativistic.For thermodynamics, see Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers, Orderout of chaos: man’s new dialogue with nature,(London, Bantam,1990).
