The present argument attempts toredress this contextual absence by locating the alchemical Eucharist more spe-cifically within Lutheran and Spiritual eschatology of the sixteenth and earlyseventeenth centuries.The alchemical eschaton and its related soteriology of Christ’ s body andblood finds its most comprehensive exposition in the four engravings of StefanMichelspacher ’ s Cabala: Spiegel der Kunst und Natur, in Alchymia (Augs-burg: David Francke 1616)2. The pictures are loosely related to a brief tradi-tional account of chemical work, structured in terms of four visions of threemirrors appearing to Michelspacher ‘ through the power of a radiating celestialfire’ . The first mirror is a fiery sapphire, displaying the philosophical Mercuryand the “ Sal sapientum” , while the second one shows him the philosophicalSulphur. The third mirror is of a divinely rosy colour, all in flames, in the midstof which there appears a very great “ arcanum” , which is the philosophical firethrough which all things come to maturation. Putting together the three mir-rors, he makes a fourth, the “ thesaurus thesaurorum” , in which he sees Godperfectly3.1Carl Gustav Jung provided the first interpretation of this theme in his Psychology and Al-chemy, 396 ff.2See Klossowski de Rola, The Golden Game, 52-58. He mentions a rare German edition of1615. Three Latin editions were reprinted in Augsburg in 1654, 1667 and 1704 as Cabala,Speculum Artis et Naturae, in Alchymia... e Germanico Latnio (sic) versa... The first Germanedition of 1615 does not have the dedication to the Rosicrucians which was added to the 1616edition and subsequently retained. Klossowski also refers to a translation in British Library MSSloane 3676, 1-36. The plates were engraved by Raphael Custos, or Custodis.3Michelspacher, Cabala, Augsburg 1654, f.

Some additional clues concerning his politicaland religious allegiances may be gained from two other known works, one ofwhich concerns the nervous system of the human body, Pinax microcosmo-graphicus (Augsburg 1615)4. This indicates that he was probably a physicianand possibly also an artist, since he claims to have illustrated the treatise him-self. The frontispiece displays a maxim “ Nosce te ipsum” , the motto of theancient Greek mystery religions: a maxim frequently used by Erasmus, whichlocates Michelspacher among the inheritors of the Catholic humanist tradi-tion5. The motto was subsequently adopted by Spirituals such as SebastianFranck, V alentin W eigel and Jacob Boehme. Michelspacher ’ s work is dedi-cated to ‘ Philipp Heinhofer [sic] of the city of Augsburg’6. The second publi-cation by Michelspacher concerns a completely different subject, namely thegraphic art of single-point perspective, which indicates that he had receivedsome artistic training: Opera das ist Grundliche doch Kurze Anzeigung WieNothwendig die Lobliche Kunst der Geometriae sive inn der Perspectiv(Augsburg: David Francke 1616)7.

He alsomentions Wenzel Jamnitzer, the south German engraver. T he book is similarlydedicated to Philipp Heinhofer (also written as “ Hainhofer” , “ Ainhofer” or“ Hannhofer” ). Michelspacher records that he collected texts from Thurn,Strassburg and Nuremburg: cities which, along with Augsburg and the Tyrol,had provided a harbour during the sixteenth century for dissident Protestantsof a Spiritualist tendency, including groups of Paracelsians.The name “ Pacher” originates in south Tyrol and is still a common name inthe Alto Adige of the present day; but it does not originate historically in anyone particular family, being rather a generic name for any kind of wayfaringload-bearer. By the fifteenth century, numerous unrelated families of this namehad moved to Brunico from the surrounding valleys. It is intriguing in thepresent context, however, that the famous painter Friedrich Pacher (c. 1435-1508) and the sculptor Michael Pacher (c.1437-1498), both of Tyrolean ori-gins although seemingly unrelated, had introduced the Italian single-point per-spective system into Austrian art – an aesthetic and mathematical interestwhich their namesake Michelspacher continued into the early seventeenth cen-tury8. It is even possible that he adopted this surname as a pseudonym, forKlossowski de Rola mentions a rare first edition of the Cabala printed in 1615in which the surname appears as “ Muschelspachen” ; however, no Austrianfamilies of that name have been traced. The coat-of-arms refers only to thealchemical principles and is not a personal bearing9.Michelspacher’ s Paracelsianism, which is evident from the Cabala, mayaccount for his removal from the climate of the oppressive Jesuit Counter-Reformation in the Tyrol to the more tolerant atmosphere of Augsburg, whereMatthaus Francke (active 1559-1568) also known as Francus, who married Barbara Hofer, acard maker and letter writer. His printing house was in the Krughaus of the Steuerbezirk “ vomNewen Thor” . Michael Manger (1570-1603) from Opferbaum near Wü rzburg, married hiswidow in 1569 and inherited his printing works. Augsburg printers, working collectively underthe sign “ Ad insigne Pinus” , 1594-1619, included David Francke and Christoph Mang in 1603.This collective issued books in Greek and Latin. Its patrons were the Stadtpfleger Marcus Welser,rector of St. Anne’ s gymnasium and the librarian David Hochsel. When Manger died in 1603,David Francke (1604-1625) continued the family business. Christoph Mang (1603-1624) hadworked with Manger and probably continued to work for Francke. See Benzing,Buchdrü ckerlexikon des 16.

In 1467 Michael was working as a citizen of Bruneck(Brunico), but Rasmo thinks that his family probably came from one of the neighbouring valleyssuch as the German valley of Vila (Wielenbach), from where a Pacher family came as jewellers tosettle in Brunico. Friedrich Pacher came from Novacella.

A free city, like the neighbouring Nuremberg, Augsburg had a longtradition of tolerating religious dissidence10. An immediate cause for Michels-pacher ’ s transference to Augsburg could have been the Jesuit persecution ofAdam Haslmayr, a vocal early promoter of the Rosicrucian Manifestos12. Inthe Tyrol the Counter-Reformation had been introduced by Peter Canisius inthe early 1550s, and Jesuit houses were established at Graz, Innsbruck,Olomouc and other centres. With the death of Ferdinand I in 1595, the Tyrolhad largely returned to Roman Catholicism (with the exception of the inacces-sible mountains of the V orarlberg)13. In spite of these repressions, a thrivingnetwork of Paracelsian alchemists existed in the Tyrol during the early seven-teenth century. Carlos Gilly has examined the evidence of their interactionsand has specifically identified Haslmayr, who lived in Heiligen Kreutz, as acentral figure. Haslmayr polemicised against the Jesuits and printed a re-sponse to the Fama Fraternitatis in 1612, claiming that he had seen it in manu-script in the Tyrol in 161014. He believed that the Rosicrucians were the har-bingers of Elias Artista, sent by God to spread the true theosophy – by whichhe meant Paracelsianism. Haslmayr was an eschatologist, referring to the com-ing of the Lion (which Gilly has interpreted as a reference to the account of theSeven Seals in Revelation) and the imminent Judgment. From 1603,Haslmayr, like other Tyrolean Paracelsians15, was pursued by the archdukeMaximilian and the Jesuits. In 1618 the Jesuits accused Haslmayr of heresy,and Maximilian sent him to the galleys in 1623. Gilly notes that Tyrolean and Augsburgian alchemists corresponded witheach other in this period, Paracelsian activity in Augsburg being centred on theCollegium Medicorum, which would have provided an accomodating milieufor Michelspacher. His artistic interests were placed, it appears, under the aus-pices of Philipp Hainhofer (1578-1647), an art-advisor and political agent formany of the major European courts. Michelspacher would have found Hain-hofer to be in sympathy with his religious affiliations as well, for Hainhofer10Gottlieb et al, Geschichte der Stadt Augsburg, 392-411; Russell, Lay Theology, 114ff.12See Evans, Making of the Habsburg Monarchy, 346-449 and Evans, Rudolf II and hisWorld, 84-115.13A useful historical overview of this region is provided in Bucking, Kultur und Gesellschaftin Tirol um 1600, passim.14The standard authority on this topic is Gilly, Adam Haslmayr, passim. According to Gilly,Haslmayr was a notary in Hall in Tyrol, having been formerly a Latin schoolmaster in Botzen.His musical compositions were published in Augsburg in 1592.15Gilly, Adam Haslmayr, 33ff. In 1605 Haslmayr was in contact with alchemists in Tyrol suchas Lorenz Lutz, Georg Fuger, Urban Kumpfmuller, Armer Leutt, Bartholomaus Wietaller (Salz-burg), Abraham Schnitzer and daughter Anna Maria Lacknerein (Innsbruck)."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"204URSZULA SZULAKOWSKAbelonged to a family of evangelicals associated with loosely-organised groupsof pietistic laity who were critical of the Lutheran church.16 The Hainhoferfamily had temporarily abandoned Augsburg in 1582-1591, in protest at thecity council’ s adoption of the reformed papal calendar17. In his work as an art-agent, Hainhofer obtained substantial commissions for Augsburg artists; hismost famous project was the art-cabinet for Duke Philipp II of Pommern-Stettin, which involved twenty-four masters in the creation of a cosmic“ Wunderkammer” including a pharmacy as well as art-works, books, clocksand musical instruments18. Hainhofer’ s patronage was crucial to the survival ofthe city’ s artists, artisans and intellectuals, including Michelspacher.19 The essence of Michelspacher ’ s own theology and political position is dis-played in the fourth and final engraving of the Cabala, which depicts acrowned figure seated in a fountain as Christ the philosopher’ s stone, the goalof the alchemical process and the source of both spiritual and physical regen-eration (fig. 4). He administers the communion of his own blood in two chal-ices to the Sun and Moon (Sulphur and Mercury), representing soul and body.Since wine was offered to the laity only in the reformed Church of this period,such an image indicates that Michelspacher was a Protestant. It is necessary,however, to ascertain the exact nature of Michelspacher ’ s Protestant convic-tions, and more specifically that of his theology regarding Christ’ s body andblood in the Eucharist as well as in his alchemical theory. In this context, it isnecessary to consider a late medieval iconographic motif which appears at thetop right of the same engraving, that of the cross-bearing Christ standing in awine-press operated by an angel hovering over him. The blood that comesfrom the suffering body of Christ streams down the picture, to feed the foun-tain in which the resurrected Christ is seated as the Second Person of the HolyTrinity (as indicated by his crown). It is essential to note that the theme of thewine-press has its origins within the Roman Catholic discourse of the RealPresence of Christ in the Eucharist and, moreover, that by the sixteenth centuryit was being used in southern Germany and France as a manifesto of the dogma16For the evangelicals in Augsburg and Nuremberg see the account in Russell, Lay Theologyin the Reformation, 25ff, 37, 41ff.17For Philipp Hainhofer (Ainhofer) see Neue Deutsche Biographie, 8, 524-25.18See Hausmann, ‘ Der Pommersche Kunstschrank’ , 337-52. Also Bruno Bushart, ‘ Kunst undStadtbild’ in: Gottlieb, Geschichte der Stadt Augsburg, 382 ff.19Hainhofer’ s correspondence with Herzog August of Braunschweig exists in 17 volumes inthe Wolfenbü ttel Bibliothek und Staatsarchiv. In the Augsburger Stadtarchiv are his diaries fromApril 1632 to October 1635 (but this is too late to be relevant to the history of Hainhofer’ spatronage of Michelspacher).

Y et, in Michelspacher’ s engrav-ing the rite of communion is that of the Protestant denomination. How is thisdoctrinal contradiction between Protestant and Catholic belief to be under-stood in Michelspacher’ s context? T he most likely possibility is that these op-posing eucharistic doctrines are reconciled through Michelspacher ’ s adher-ence to the beliefs of the Paracelsian Spirituals, the third generation since the1520s of dissidents who were more at odds with Lutheran orthodoxy than theywere with Roman Catholicism. At the top left of Michelspacher’ s engraving appears the Tetragrammaton,the Hebrew Name of God, shining in an aureole of light (fig. 4). Flying fromthe Mystic Wine Press towards the Tetragrammaton is the dove of the HolySpirit, who thence descends to the Fountain of Life. The bird’ s trajectory alongwith that of the stream of blood produce the shape of an equilateral triangle,whose apex lies in the Tetragrammaton, while the Fountain and Wine Pressform the corners of its base. The scene is set within the semi-circle of a rain-bow, while the Fountain is specifically located within a square vineyard thatforms an enclosed garden or sanctum. The geometrical structure subtly createdby the composition of these various images is that of a squared circle. Thisgeometry of the fourth engraving is conceptually related to two other geo-metrical diagrams which appear in the first engraving, displaying the sameconfiguration of circle, square and triangle (fig. 1). In the earlier engraving thediagram is stated to be an image of the Paracelsian “ Azoth” , the alchemicaland cosmological quintessence, which Heinrich Khunrath (1560-1605) hadalready equated with Christ in his Amphiteatrum Sapientiae Aeternae (Ham-burg, 1595)21. In Khunrath’ s Amphiteatrum his gnostic pneumatology had been exhibitedin a circular engraving of Christ (1595), shown as resurrected in his glorifiedphysical body. In this image Christ’ s grace was dispersed through the whole ofa cabbalistic universe by the fiery dove of the Holy Spirit. Within a later rec-20The issue is examined in Vloberg, L’ Eucharistie dans l’ Art, 172-183.21See the discussion of Khunrath’ s theosophy in Szulakowska, The Alchemy of Light, 79-137. Khunrath’ s gnosticism led to his political persecution. The primary model for his own sys-tem was the kabbalism of Johannes Reuchlin in his De V erbo Mirifico in which Christ wasidentified with the cabbalistic sephiroth of the “ Ruah-Elohim” , the creative principles of thematerial universe. Khunrath amplified Reuchlin’ s cabbalistic Christology by taking recourse toParacelsus and Weigel. Thus, Christ, the Ruah-Elohim, also became the Paracelsian “ azoth” , thefifth essence which is both spiritual and material in nature. Khunrath refers to the “ Ruah-Elohim” as being the Christ who redeemed creation through the sacrifice of his blood. SeeKhunrath, V om Hylealischen ... Chaos, 75. He compares the philosopher’ s stone to Christ who isthe Paracelsian universal panacea in Khunrath, V on Hylealischen ... Chaos, 86-88.

The Aramaic word “ maranatha” was associated with apocalypticsoteriology, as well as with the earliest Christian rites of the Eucharist. In 1Corinthians 16:22, the exclamation “ maranatha” accompanies pronounce-ments of anathema against any non-believers who may be present at the com-munion rite. For the early Christians it was a prayer for the Parousia, the Sec-ond Coming of Christ, ‘ Come Lord!’ Paul was thereby referring to thepunishment awaiting the unbeliever on the Last Day23. In Khunrath’ s Spiritual-ist context his reference to the misuse of the word “ maranatha” expresses acriticism of both the Roman and the Lutheran sacraments, which were merelyexternal signs but did not effect a genuine spiritual renewal in the body andsoul of the recipient. Both churches perpetrated an unpardonable offenceagainst the Holy Spirit, a blasphemous action which destined them to eternalperdition24. Apocalyptic terminology thus enabled Paracelsian alchemists tojustify their own soteriological beliefs, and permitted them to threaten withdivine punishment their religious and political foes. André Sé guenny has recently offered a particularly clear analysis of thefirst Spirituals of the 1520s-1530s who were opposed to Luther while continu-ing to reject the Roman Church. T hey required a personalised religion to su-persede that of the Lutheran church, for the inadequacies of which they founda solution in the Catholic humanism rejected by Luther himself25. LikeErasmus, the Spirituals rejected Luther’ s definition of humanity as an essen-tially abject creation distanced inexorably from a Wholly Other God. Insteadthe Spirituals divinised human nature and made it into an integral part of God’ sown Being, destined to return to Him through union with the Christ-Logosalready existant within the human soul. The power of the Transcendent Spiritawakened and quickened the soul to the renewal of its pristine holiness.Christ’ s redemptive role for the Spirituals lay in the fact that he exemplifiedthe perfect man; his bloody sacrifice on the cross was pushed into the back-ground. In accordance with this, the Spirituals rejected the sacraments of thechurch as not essential to salvation (Erasmus himself, as well, had been indif-ferent to these rites). Nor was the Spiritual’ s concept of the Holy Spirit thesame as that of the Lutherans, for whom he was the Third Person of the HolyTrinity. The Spirituals, in contrast, rationalised the Spirit into an interior meta-physical force, an impersonal Transcendence, which transformed the sinner22See Szulakowska, The Alchemy of Light, fig. 35 at top right.23Wainwright, Eucharist and Eschatology, 60.24Szulakowska, The Alchemy of Light, 139-149.25Séguenny, Les Spirituels, passim."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"STEFAN MICHELSPACHER211into the “ new man” , God’ s self-generated son: like Christ, and not a lessercreation. Sé guenny argues that the Spirituals were developing an existentialistphilosophy rather than a religion with tenets of belief, and he distinguishestheir rationalising religion from the spontaneous mystical insight described inthe Theologia Germanica.In addition to Sé guenny, I would suggest that the intermediary betweenthese early Erasmian-influenced Spirituals – such as Jö rg Hauck, Hans Denckand Sebastian Franck – and the Paracelsian Spirituals of the 1580s to 1620swas Caspar Schwenckfeld (1489-1561): it was he who enabled them to recon-sider the doctrine of transubstantiation in the communion rite. As a result oftheir encounter with Paracelsian alchemical models of transmutation, laterSpirituals such as Khunrath, Michelspacher, Boehme and Frankenberg re-stored the soteriological role of the Eucharistic rite in varying degrees. Cer-tainly it is clear that by the late sixteenth century certain Paracelsians had cometo understand the Eucharist in terms of a metaphysical chemistry aided by theastral virtues of Nature, not by the Holy Spirit alone. Of course this was not anentirely new concept: comparable ideas can be found in the fourteenth centuryin the work of Arnald of Villanova, in the Rosarium Philosophorum, as well asin the Aurora Consurgens of the early fifteenth century, which also referred tothe Last Judgement26. These earlier alchemists, however, had used the iconog-raphy of the Eucharist to devise for themselves a parallel transmutational ritein which their chemicals were changed in a manner comparable to the transub-stantiation of the communion bread. The ritual of the Roman mass enabledthem to prove that it was possible to unite Nature with God. The scope of theParacelsian Eucharist, in contrast, was far more ambitious. In the early six-teenth century the notion of an alchemical mass in which matter was glorifiedas to become part of the body of Christ was hazarded tentatively by MelchiorCibinensis of Hungary, a Protestant courtier at the Imperial court who lost hislife for his beliefs27. His alchemical ritual ended inconclusively before themoment of transubstantiation. Some of the later Paracelsians did produce afull alchemical communion in which the alchemist himself was transmutedinto the essence of Christ. Such a heretical concept reached its fullest develop-ment in the work of Jacob Boehme (1575-1624)28 and Abraham von26See von Franz, Aurora Consurgens, 390-392. Also Jung, Psychology and Alchemy, 374-375.27Jung, Psychology and Alchemy, 396 nt 157. Melchior Cibinensis was the same person asNicolaus Melchior Szebeni, chaplain and astrologer at the court of King Ladislas II from 1490.Cibinensis remained with Louis II from 1516 until 1526, when he moved to the court ofFerdinand I in Vienna, where he was executed in 1531.28For example, Boehme, ‘ V on Christi Testamenten’ in: Samtliche Schriften, 6, no pag."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"212URSZULA SZULAKOWSKAFrankenberg (1593-1652)29 where it attained a cosmological significance inwhich both man and Nature realised their monistic identity with God. In fact,Frankenberg’ s best known work, Raphael das ist Einheiliges Licht ... Artzeney(1639), was a cryptic and indirect alchemical disquisition on the thaumaturgicpowers of the spiritual Eucharist Furthermore I would suggest that the spiritualEucharist is also the half-concealed but actually central theme of RobertFludd’s Medicina Catholica (Frankfurt: William Fitzer 1629-31). Schwenckfeld’ s influence may have encouraged the Paracelsian Spiritualsto restore the doctrine of transubstantiation, although they did not reaffirm thesacramental authority of the Lutheran church, the rituals of which most ofthem regarded as redundant. Schwenckfeld’ s beliefs concerning transubstan-tiation extended its doctrinal logic into an astonishing heresy: he believed thatChrist had been entrusted by God with the transformation of the carnal humanbody into his own resurrected and glorified body, a union in which everymanbecame God himself30. A more specifically identifiable intermediary betweenearly Spirituals and Paracelsian alchemists was V alentin W eigel (1535-1588):the first Spiritual to adopt Paracelsian hermeticism. He identified both Godand the individual soul with the Universal Soul of Nature. Moreover, he statedin his Gnothi Seauton (“ Know Thyself” (1571) that if the sacrifice of Christwas to be of any use, then the “ vita Christi” had to occur within the soul itself,since ‘ Christus extra nos non salvat’31. In the Kirchen- oder Hauss-Postill(1578-1579) he argued, like the other Spirituals, that humans were not merelythe adopted children of God but his real offspring, in that they were joinedwith Christ “ somatikos” , “ leibhä fftig” : having his flesh and blood within them.Weigel retained the sacraments while believing, like Sebastian Franck, thatthey had become corrupted. As in Schwenkfeld’ s and Khunrath’ s Spiritualism, it is the eternal glorifiedChrist within the soul – rather than the historical Christ crucified – who is theessential factor in Michelspacher ’ s soteriology. In order to clarify this point,Michelspacher’ s engraving can be usefully compared with Lucas Cranach’ s(1472-1553) illustrations of Lutheran Christology, and more specifically withCranach’ s emphasis on the historic Christ and his redeeming blood in the mainaltarpiece of the State Church in Weimar. In comparison, Michelspacher de-picts his cross-bearing Christ as a tiny figure, hidden away at the top right of29Crisp, Abraham von Frankenberg, 3-7.30Corpus Schwenckfeldianorum, 6, 554: ‘ ...durch ...welche solche verclerung nu nichtssanderss weder die gottwerdung des menschens in Christo/ unnd gegleubt werdenn’ .31Weigel, ‘ Kirchen- oder Hauss-Postill’ in: Peuckert and Zeller, V alentin Weigel: Sä mtlicheSchriften, 17, 57, 232, 287."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"STEFAN MICHELSPACHER213his engraving. In assessing the Christology of the Paracelsians it may be notedin addition that, apart from this one instance, the Passion of Christ is neverdepicted in late Renaissance German alchemy. In contrast, some earlier al-chemical illustrators of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had venturedto use the icon of Christ on the cross, as seen most specifically in Das Buch derHeiligen Dreifä ltigkeit which had appeared in the southern German areas inthe 1420s32. Despite the heretical appearance of this eccentric treatise, Obristhas demonstrated that its theology was completely conventional, designed as arhetorical political tool. In short, the sheer absence of scenes from Christ’ sPassion in later Paracelsian alchemy may amplify the evidence that its originslay in the context of religious groups alienated from institutionalised dogma. Another well-known alchemical image which has been frequently men-tioned by historians for its eucharistic allusions appears in Michael Maier’ sSymbola Aureae Mensae Duodecim Nationum (Frankfurt: Luca Jennis 1617).It illustrates an unorthodox Lutheran mass in its earliest form, still quite simi-lar in its rites to that of the Roman Church. Maier (1568-1622) had commis-sioned this illustration to accompany the alchemical treatise of Cibinensis,who had displayed his Protestant affiliations by dedicating his work ‘ ...to thesaving reformation of the church...’ . Maier ’ s own religious beliefs were neverclearly stated in his treatises, but they must have been coloured by Paracelsianeschatology, as is suggested by his supportive commentary on the RosicrucianManifestos in his Themis Aurea (1618). It was surely a daring act on Maier ’ spart to print the treatise of an alchemist who had been condemned for heresyby the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I in 1531. The eschatological context in Maier ’ s engraving is provided by the imageof the Virgin Mary suckling her new-born son. This motif implies that theEucharistic host, elevated by the priest in the picture, contains the Real Pres-ence of Christ, although not according to the Roman doctrine of transubstan-tiation. In Luther ’ s understanding of the Eucharist there was a “ communicatioidiomatum” which was the effect of the ubiquity of Christ’ s physical humanityby virtue of the ubiquity of his divinity. Hence, in the Eucharist Christ’ s bodyco-existed with that of the bread and wine. Equally significant is the fact thatMaier’ s image of the Virgin corresponds to that of the Apocalyptic Virgin inthe book of Revelation (12:1-6, 13-16), which describes the vision of a‘ woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head acrown of twelve stars’ , who gives birth to a male child. The dragon who pur-sues her is doomed to be crushed under her feet. Lutherans interpreted this32See Obrist, Les dé buts de l’ imagerie alchimique, 142ff on the Nuremberg manuscript andfigs. 17, 18, 20, 21, 26, 34."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"214URSZULA SZULAKOWSKAfemale figure as the Reformed Church, the forerunner of the New Jerusalem,pregnant with the true faith whose persecutor, the dragon, was the RomanChurch. The Catholic interpretation, conversely, held that she was the VirginMary, the new Eve, who bore the Messiah and was, thus, the mother of the onetrue Apostolic Church. In Maier ’ s context, moreover, she could be manifestingon behalf of the Paracelsian Spirituals as a warning of impending judgment,evoking mentally the eucharistic cry “ maranatha” against the non-elect in theLutheran church. Maier’ s apocalyptic Eucharist may serve to interpret the second engravingof Michelspacher ’ s Cabala, which also clearly derives its visual terminologyfrom the book of Revelation (fig. 2). It depicts a beast that, at one level, sym-bolises the alchemical prime matter. At another level, however, it is relatedicongraphically to Lutheran engravings of the papal Antichrist. Among ortho-dox Lutherans the obsession with the Last Days and the Second Coming hadbeen brought to a feverish pitch by Luther and the first generation of the re-formers33. Eschatologists influenced by Melanchthon’ s humanistic curiositydrew on evidence from history to complement biblical prophecy, but also onastrology, mathematics, occultism and alchemy34. Such information was madeavailable by the enormous growth of the publishing industry in centres such asStrassburg, Nuremberg and Augsburg35. Barnes has argued that, in fact,Luther ’ s theology was by its very nature eschatological and apocalyptic36. InLuther ’ s view, since Germany had failed to keep the true faith, the heavy pun-ishment of God was imminent37. The Antichrist had been identified by Lutherwith the Papacy whose triple crown was transposed to the Whore of Babylon(Revelation 17: 1-7) in the Wittenberg Bible of 1522. The standard apocalyp-tic iconography of the Reformation period did not develop according to themodel of Albrecht Dü rer ’ s apocalyptic engravings (1498) but, emerging fromLuther ’ s social circle, was created primarily by Lucas Cranach in his woodcutsof the Passional Christi und Antichristi (1521) and his illustrations forLuther’s Septembertestament...(1522). Rome was cast as Babylon and thePapacy as the Beast from the bottomless pit (Revelation 11: 7)38. Michelspacher’ s Beast is more heterogeneous than Cranach’ s in that it33Barnes, Prophecy and Gnosis, 2ff.34Barnes, Prophecy and Gnosis, 72-73, 79, 87.35Chrisman, Lay Culture, Learned Culture, passim, and Eisenstein, The Printing Press, pas-sim.36Barnes, Prophecy and Gnosis, 39ff.37Barnes, Prophecy and Gnosis, 60-66.38John Huss and Savanarola had identified the Pope with Antichrist for moral reasons, ratherthan on the basis of historical evidence.

This startling creature wears a papalcrown, a set of dragon-like feet and tail, and cow’ s udders and horns. A wom-an’ s face belching hell-fire completes this winsome ensemble. The apocalypticreferences of the Cabala’ s second engraving imply that the fourth engravingshould be read within the same context. T his last scene expounds a more spe-cific text than that of Christ as the Philosopher ’ s Stone, or even of the alchemi-cal process as equivalent to the eucharistic ritual. In actual fact,Michelspacher’ s treatise pictures nothing less than the feast celebrating thewedding of the Messiah to the New Jerusalem at the Parousia, to which theHeavenly Bridegroom invites the elect (Revelation 19: 7-9). The question arises: who are these elect in Michelspacher’ s own soterio-logy? Are these images a general reference to the broader political problems ofthe Lutheran church, or can they be read still more precisely so as to reveal thepolitical divisions within the Protestant community itself? For example, in thesecond engraving the Beast lashes with his tail at six stars: at the first level ofsignification these indicate the lower metals, while at the head of this picturestands the five-pointed star of the alchemical quintessence, the azoth. In thefirst chapter of Revelation the dragon is described as sweeping away the starswith his tail39. The text states that ‘ ...the seven stars are angels of the sevenchurches...’ (Revelation 1: 20), that is to say the communities of the faithfulwho alone have merited the real presence of Christ. Perhaps Michelspacherwas alluding to communities of Paracelsians threatened by the Counter-Refor-mation in his native Tyrol, rather than to the general Lutheran unease of theperiod. Visual evidence favours this suggestion, since it indicates thatMichelspacher ’ s apocalypticism was distinct from that of Melanchthon’ ssanctioned followers, his own iconography being mediated rather by Paracel-sian sources. For example, an image similar to that of the Beast in the Cabalaappears on the frontispiece to the first edition of Paracelsus’ commentary onthe Nuremberg Figures published in 1569 in Basle (fig. 5; these were anony-mously produced apocalyptic images of a political character dating from theearly sixteenth century)40. Moreover, the design of the seven stars in Michels-pacher ’ s engraving of the Beast is closely related to a scene of the seven plan-ets on the frontispiece of Paracelsus’ s Practica... gemacht auf Europen (Nu-39Beale, John’ s Use of the Old Testament in Revelation, 105ff on the dragon and the ‘ sevenlampstands’ (i.e., churches).

The other two engravings in Michelspacher ’ s Cabala superficially appearto carry references only to practical laboratory work. Nonetheless, visual pri-ority over such pragmatic concerns is given to elaborate geometrical figureswhich relate immediately to the fourth engraving of Christ. These geometriesare Michelspacher’ s “ cabala” : in this period the term could refer to any systemof mathematical and geometrical calculation, not only to that of the Jewishtradition. They also carry eschatological meanings. In the first engraving (fig.1), two diagrams are set within a large rectangle, the circle on the left referringto “ azoth” , the quintessence or Christ, while the circle on the right records thealchemical principles and their location among the liberal arts according to aLullian model. It is the more obscure lettering, half-hidden in the opaque back-ground around the edges of the rectangle, however, which is most significantin these figures. At the four corners capital letters form the word “ GOTT” ,while additional letters in the middle of the rectangle form an “ A” within anFigure 5.

Below this appears Michelspacher ’ s personal mongram in the form of theentwined letters “ M, L, P , S” , equivalent to “ M[iche]L SP[acher]” . The “ A O”of course refer to Revelation 1: 8 (‘ “ I am the Alpha and the Omega” , says theLord God, who is and who was and who is to come, theAlmighty...’ ). Thesame theme is encountered in Revelation 1: 17, when Christ says of himself ‘ Iam the first and the last’ , and again in Revelation 22: 13: ‘ I am the Alpha andthe Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end’ . “ AO” is alatinisation of the name of God “ YHWH”42.The third engraving of the Cabala also appears to indicate a purely al-chemical context, that of the conjunction (fig. 3). It shows the seven planetsstanding on the sides of a mountain at whose heart is concealed a phoenix,symbolising resurrection, perched on the roof of a summer-house. Within thisdwelling sit the naked king and queen of the alchemical process. Outside, atthe foot of the mountain, a blind man stands helpless at the bottom right, whilea man who has sight catches rabbits. The kabbalistic elements of Michels-pacher ’ s treatise do not refer to the Hebrew kabbalah itself but to other historiccomputational systems, in this case that of pseudo-Lullian alchemy and of as-trology. Hence the cabbalistic content of this particular image, in fact, consistsof the circle of the Zodiac around the mountain, although the constellations donot appear in their natural order of procession. Instead they are grouped inpairs, so as to represent the conjunction of the opposing elements. T he apoca-lyptic content of this third engraving is signified by the figure of Mercury,whose position at the summit of the mountain signifies his perfection as theazoth, in itself a combination of matter and spirit. He is standing within thefountain and garden enclosure which reappear in the fourth engraving: a clearequation with the apocalyptic Christ. The combination of the mountain and the blind and sighted men could beanother reference to political problems in Michelspacher ’ s native Tyrol forthose who claim to have “ gnosis” or inner vision. In Revelation 21: 10 the cityof the New Jerusalem descends onto a great mountain, a vision derived fromEzekiel 40: 2 of the cosmic mountain where heaven and earth meet, and ofParadise (Ezekiel 28:14). The images of miners within mountain caves in thefirst engraving may be another allusion to the same Tyrolean political context.Silver miners from Saxony had settled in Austria where they had proved to bea particularly receptive audience for evangelical preachers proclaiming bothspiritualised forms of belief and a church run by a lay apostolate. There is yet another cryptogram hidden within the second and third en-gravings of the Cabala, namely, the letters “ VWIWV” which stand for ‘ Unser42Bauckham, Theology of the Book of Revelation, 27ff."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"218URSZULA SZULAKOWSKAWasser ist Wasser Unser’ . This old alchemical axiom is christianised withinthe apocalyptic discourse of the Cabala and now carries connotations of thetext of John 4: 14: ‘ Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shallnever thirst: but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of waterspringing up into everlasting life’ . The water is that of baptism as well as of theeucharistic wine. St. Paul in I Corinthians 11: 27-34 and II Corinthians 5: 10regards the Eucharist as a projection of the Last Judgment which partly fulfillsand strengthens the promise of judgment and pardon received in baptism. Inthe fourth engraving, Christ is enthroned in a baptismal font, labelled “ DerBrü n des Lebens” . Baptism redeems through the Holy Spirit that descendsfrom the risen Christ, but Michelspacher ’ s image could be referring to a per-sonal transformation rather than to the institutionalised rite43. For it must be remarked that the image of the vineyard of the fourth en-graving not only promises the bliss of salvation but also has an additional andmuch darker, indeed menacing, aspect. This is the threat of perdition for thenon-elect, which becomes apparent when Michelspacher ’ s picture isrecontextualised within the narrative of Revelation 14: 17-20 concerning thegathering and pressing of the grapes. The wine-press signifies punishment in-flicted on the unjust and unfaithful. In the book of Revelation the vintage ispart of the narrative of the congregation of the kings of the earth and theirarmies at the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16: 12-14), and of the subse-quent judgement of the nations at the Parousia (Revelation 19: 15) 44. Those who survive Armageddon are welcomed by the banquet of whichthe Eucharist is an anticipation, as a soteriological covenant proclaimed at thetime of the Last Supper – for example, in Luke 22: 20 ‘ T his cup is the newcovenant in my blood’ . In John 6: 54 Christ states ‘ ... he who eats my flesh anddrinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day...’ . Thetheme is subsequently reiterated by St. Paul. The Old Testament, moreover,had also used an image of feasting for the chosen of God, for example, in IIBaruch 29: 5, in a description of the eschaton: ‘ ... on each vine there shall bea thousand branches, and each branch shall produce a thousand clusters, andeach cluster shall produce a thousand grapes, and each grape shall produce a43The New Jerusalem includes the water of life, cf. Revelation 22: 1-2. Another alchemicalinterpretation of the “ VWIWV” is in a commentary by an anonymous author appended toFrankenberg’ s Raphael ..., ed. pr. in Amsterdam 1706, 45: ‘ Unser Wasser ist Wasser Unser: einhimlisch Wasser/ ein Wasser des Lebens: ein Schlisch Wasser/ welchem alle Geister lieben. .. Eskommet nur aus einem Einzigen Brö nnen auf das Erden/ so da lieget an einem heimlichen Ort inJudea: und hat einen so grossen Aussfluss/ das sein Wasser ü ber die gantze Welt fleust/ undjederman behalt’ . The text depicts three geometric symbols: circle, triangle, square, as well astheir tabulation, and is entitled “ De aqua – V W+WV sapientum” .44Bauckham, The Theology of the Book of Revelation, 96-98."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"STEFAN MICHELSPACHER219cor of wine. And those who have hungered shall rejoice...’45 In Michels-pacher ’ s engraving, another symbol of the sacramental covenant is the rain-bow around the throne, which recalls God’ s promise to Noah in Genesis 9: 13,reiterated in Revelation 4: 3, where John sees around the throne of the Lamb ‘ arainbow like an emerald in appearance’ . A close examination of the two people kneeling before Christ brings tomind other apocalyptic elements. For example, there are the joyous connota-tions of the Marriage Feast of Cana, another prefiguration of the Last Supper,the changing of water into wine, and a symbol of the feast on the Last Day.Lying on the ground between the couple are three crowns, symbolising thethree principles of salt, mercury and sulphur but also recalling the casting-down of their crowns by the twenty-four elders in the first chapter of Revela-tions. T he male and female figures are also reminiscent of the two witnesses inRevelation 11: 3-13, who are martyred and resurrected, and ascend to heavenafter three and a half days. This accords with the alchemical process in whichthe prime materials are considered to be “ tortured” and resurrected, since onlymortification can purify matter sufficiently to permit its union with the spirit.Finally, the happy pair is depicted as the elect among metals. The other five,like the Foolish Virgins in Christ’ s parable of the Parousia, are rejected andremain below the earth in purgatory. They wait, heads bent, pleading for thepurifying fire of the Holy Spirit and offering the alchemical bellows to Christwho does not acknowledge their presence. In this image, Christ is the Logoswhose sacraments are an inner enlightenment reserved for an elite group. The Lutheran concern with eschatology had triggered a huge revival ofastrological interest in Germany in the mid-sixteenth century, and Michels-pacher ’ s alchemical apocalypse should be located within this context. Fromthe outset even Luther had had to accept certain aspects of astrology since,according to Luke 21: 25, Christ had stated that the first signs of the end wouldappear in the sun, moon and stars. Moreover, by the 1530s the astrologicalpredictions of Paracelsus were widely dispersed. Paracelsus had foretold thatone “ Elias Artista” would appear to reform the arts and sciences, and theParacelsians had seen in the new star of 1604 the harbinger of his advent46. Thequintessential star in the Cabala’ s second engraving could be a reference tothis phenomenon, modelled on treatises such as those of Paul Nagel of Leip-zig, a Paracelsian chiliast in his Himmels Zeichen. Grosse ConjunctionesPlanetarum superiorum, und neuer Wunderstern, so Anno 1604...(Hall inSachsen 1605) and in his Catoptromantia Physica (Leipzig 1610). Nagel45Wainwright, Eucharist and Eschatology, 19-22.46Barnes, Prophecy and Gnosis, 216-19."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"220URSZULA SZULAKOWSKAstated that in order to read the heavens correctly, it was necessary to knowmathematics, medicine, scripture, the biblical prophets, such as Daniel andEzekiel, as well as Revelation. Moreover, only the elect who understoodapocalyptic astronomy would be saved at the eschaton. More specific references to these astrological predictions may also exist inthe second engraving of the Cabala, where there appears an obscure arrange-ment of astral constellations, the water signs being governed by Capricornrepresenting earth, the water signs by Leo representing fire, while the air signsare ruled by Taurus whose element is earth (fig. 2). They are joined together bya geometrical triangle in whose corners are placed the signs for sulphur, mer-cury and “ materia” . The traditional alchemical reference would be to the cir-culation of the elements whereby they are transmuted into their opposites, butthere could also be present here an apocalyptic meaning. In this case, the in-verted triangle of the elemental stars cuts into the body of the papal Beast. Inastrology such trigonal astrological alignments traditionally heralded doomfor the established order. In Michelspacher’ s picture, the large star of the quin-tessence has the form of an (albeit irregular) geographical compass. If north isat the top, then from its southern region the star showers the fiery south windonto the alchemical flask and through the constellations onto the Beast47.There had been one such trigonal governed by the fiery constellations andplanets in 1584, and it had had caused enormous excitement. EustachiusPoyssel in Die Schlussel David, Esaie: 22, Apocalip: 3 (1594) and in DieBraut dess Lambs, Das Himmlische Newe Jerusalem...(1591) had predictedmore ominous trigons for the early seventeenth century. Other apocalyptic prophecies issued in the same period as the Cabala werethose of Johann Faulhaber of Ulm, many of whose students were from Swit-zerland and Austria. His Himlische gehaime Magia Oder Newe CabalistischeKunst... (Nuremberg, 1613) was succeeded by a pro-Rosicrucian treatise,Mysterium arithmeticum (1615). Faulhaber ’ s apocalyptic Rosicrucianism wasemulated by David Meder’ s Iudicium Theologicum von Brü derschafft desRosen Creutz (1616). A slightly earlier source for the eschatologicalmessianism of the original Rosicrucian Manifestos was Simon Studion’ sNaometria (“ New Measurement” ) of 1604 in which he employed Poyssel’ sanalytical methods in dating the Parousia for 162348. Michelspacher dedicatedthe 1616 edition of his treatise to the Rosy Cross Fraternity, and the influenceof such apocalyptic mathematicians and astrologers on his work is undeniable.47In the Aurora Consurgens the south wind is fiery, like the alchemical fire, and so is the HolySpirit; see von Franz, Aurora Consurgens, 386.48 Studion’ s Mss is in the Wü rttemberger Landesbibliothek, Stuttgart, and there is a facsimileof the manuscript in the Warburg Library, London."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"STEFAN MICHELSPACHER221 In conclusion, the apocalyptic symbology in Michelspacher’ s Cabala rep-resents a judgment on those who are not united with Christ within the soul butonly within the empty formulas of external ritual. In both Roman and Lutherandogma the sacraments of Baptism and of the Eucharist were integrally related,the water of life being the blood of Christ. The Eucharist in particular wasconsidered to be an instance of election through the grace of the Holy Spirit.Michelspacher ’ s Paracelsian eschatology had further narrowed down the cri-teria for the elect, by demanding from them a personal knowledge of the HolySpirit experienced in the regeneration of both body and soul. Hence, the themeof the fourth engraving of the Cabala is not only salvation and transformation,but also judgement on the rejected among both the Lutherans and the RomanCatholics.Urszula Szulakowska, lecturer in the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies atthe University of Leeds, is engaged in research into the history of alchemical illustration, withspecific interest in the late Renaissance period and the twentieth century.BibliographyBarnes, Robin Bruce, Prophecy and Gnosis: Apocalypticism in the Wake of the Lutheran Refor-mation, Stanford University Press 1988.Bauckham, Richard, The Climax of Prophecy: Studies in the Book of Revelation, Edinburgh :T&T Clark 1993.Beale, G .K., John’ s Use of the Old Testament in Revelation, Sheffield Academic Press 1998.Benzing, Josef, Buchdruckerlexikon des 16.
