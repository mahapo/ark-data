The first part discusses current research in psychoactivepreparations of ergot in various religious systems with a particular emphasis on Persian, Greek, Jewishand Islamic sources. Certain poems, hadith, and scriptural writings suggest an entheogenic heritage tovarious ancient sects that exerted and received philosophical and ritual influences over large distancesand over time. Particularly, some esoteric Shia and Sufi writings are highly suggestive of a \"celestialbotany\" that employed psychoactive plants for initiatory and ritual purposes. The second part will addresscurrent research methods that render ergot alkaloids nontoxic and entheogenic, a most crucial part ofthe discussion in the absence of a modem bioassay. This is essential, as without a chemical reality tosupport that such a preparation of entheogenic ergot is possible, all ergot theories concerning mysterytraditions would remain largely speculative.Keywords—entheogens, ergot, Islam, Shia, SufiAlas! the forbidden fruits were eaten.And thereby the warm life of reason congealed.A grain of wheat eclipsed the sun of Adam,Like as the Dragon's tail dulls the brightness of the moon.Rumi: Masnavi I Ma'nav (Whinfield 1979)The academic world has been slow to acclimate them-selves to the paradigm shifting research of scholars such asR.

One of the most elegant theories involvesthe sacred use of ergot in rituals that might extend fromEgypt to Greece, India and all over the ancient Middle East,surviving even into the Middle Ages. The first part of thisarticle will follow the extended influences of these ancientcults into Islamic groups that are heir to the convergingGnostic traditions. While all these arguments are poeticallyconvincing, proof has remained elusive, with skeptics cit-ing the lack of a successful bioassay of any entheogenicpreparation of ergot. The second part of this article (Ergotas Entheogen, written by Peter Webster) will address someof the current theories on how ergot could be consumed withrelative safety and entheogenic effects, while describingwhat may well be the most plausible method.ERGOT IN GREEK, JEWISH AND ISLAMIC GNOSISThe many varieties of the Old World entheogenictheories of religion extend from the proto-Indo-Europeansand their roving mushroom cults to the equally fungallyinspired mysteries of the ancient Greeks.

Calvert Watkins (1978) traces theritual complex of these \"famous grains\" through Indo-Eu-ropean influences that extend from Hittite cults to Homericand Eleusinian mysteries. Mott Greene (1992), disagreeingwith Wasson, identifies the sacrament as the activity of theSoma function from a variety of ergotized grains mixedwith milk and curds and strained with sheep's wool. Otherscholars, such as Dan Merkur (2(XX)), have then endeavoredto trace this same ecstatic technology of ergot intoxicationto the heart of the Judaic mystery traditions.^Evidence supports the claim that ergot was knownand employed in a ritual context in various mystery cultsthat stretched across the ancient world. These associationsremain in the Jewish material of the Midrash and appar-ently continued to exert cosmological influences in theform of specific doctrines and theologies in the region.The many splintered factions and cults that preserved suchesoteric traditions would be exemplified in a group like theManicheans who have been linked with entheogenic rites(Ruck, Staples & Heinrich 2001). The mystical tenets andpractices of the Manicheans, which Eisenman (1998) ex-haustively demonstrates is the crucial link between the oldJewish mystics and the esoteric Muslims, are consistent withmany traditions that were uniquely Shia. It appears that theearly Shia, and later their direct spiritual heirs the Sufi, hadretained either the ecstatic technology of ergot or a sacredreverence for the memory through both indigenous Persiantraditions and Greek and Jewish mystery schools.'^ As withWasson's identification of the Soma as Amanita muscaria,the ergotized grain theory is attractive but the identificationof an entheogen at the foundations of the given rites mightprove the greater contribution.\"*From agrarian cults of the \"dying gods\" to the theo-logical implications of plants that both blessed and cursed,the cherished staple of grains would be expected to retaina complex symbolic dimension that shaped agrarian worldorientation. The subtle difference between food, poison,and entheogen would no doubt have furrowed the browof the earliest shamans and priests, who at first made useof them, then perhaps restricted this use to the elite. It isknown that as early as the sixth century BC the Assyriansused ergotized rye as a chemical weapjon to poison enemywells, while its use in midwifery was also apparently known,lending further associations to this plant/fungi that could behomeopathically employed for abortions or possibly evenas an aphrodisiac (Iverson 2001).^ The article \"Mixing theKykeon\" by Webster. Perrine and Ruck (2000) rekindledan interest in the admittedly speculative field of esoterictechnologies for preparing ergot as an entheogen forritual use. Several poet/mystics have left subtle refer-ences that may indeed allude to a safe and religioususe for ergot.The short verse from the Persian poet Jalaluddin Rumiat the beginning of this article, identifying wheat as theforbidden fruit of Eden, generates interpretative exegeseswhere translators inadequately try to explain the referenceas pure astronomical symbolism.^ Rumi was an ecstaticof the lawless dervishes and his verse reveals his thoughtson matters as heterodox and heretical as hashish, opiumand wine and Tantric-type discussions of sex, even usingexamples of bestiality to elucidate esoteric doctrine.^ Hispoetry is laced with references and allusions to all mannerof transgressions, understood as a pantheogenic meditationon the oneness of god/reality. The use of dance, music, anddrugs in combination with more concentrated and prolongedmeditations and fasts that are associated with Rumi and hisdisciples, and suggest a very exacting system of initiationthat was to culminate in ecstatic theophany with Allah. Tounderstand Rumi's poetic devices it is important to takeRumi beyond his classification of Islamic mystic and into theesoteric traditions that ultimately culminated into Sufism.^SUFISM AS SHIA GNOSTICISMThe history of Sufism is intimately bound up withthat of Shia Gnosticism and both enjoyed an open expres-sion during the early years of Islam. Upon the death of theProphet, the Shia suffered extreme atrocities at the hands ofthe Sunni who, once the Prophet passed, reverted back to theold Meccan hierarchy. The murder of the Prophet's house orsupporters (Shia), inspired the policy of taqqiya or \"piousdissimulation\" in times of trouble. But as the situation forthe Shia sects grew worse this policy became crystalized inthe concept of the Hidden Imam, or the Standing One, whoseexistence is necessary for the existence of the world. Whilethis subject could fill even a lengthy volume, the criticalpoint is that the concealing of the Imam and the esotericintrigue that was attendant was a purely pragmatic strategy;one that Eisenman (1998) pays particular attention to as alink between these cults. The ghosts of the massacre of theShia at Karbala permeate every tactical consideration of theShia, even if it meant the intemal struggle of Shia verses ShiaFollowing the precedent of the Fiver Imams (the Za-ydi), each consecutive Imam performs his function, oftenexoterically contradictory, in each community. The esotericteaching of the Hidden Imams probably crystallized in thenecessity of replacing and hiding their leaders from the con-tinued inter-sect rivalry and Sunni persecution. The Sunniwould demand to the see the body of an Imam to confirmhis death as cults and radical sects broke off on \"rumors\"and certainly deliberate plots, sometimes amounting to Shiaversus Shia violence, to conceal the true real identity of theTrue Imam.As the Twelver Shia claim, every Imam was murderedby the Sunni, and as the Alawi claim, the sixth Imam Jafargave the mantle of authority to a \"heretic\" Syrian in the mideighth centuiy, who started the Alawi/Nusayri sect that combi nesJournal of Psychoactive Drugs494Volume 38 (4).

Attepts to find thetrue natures of these complicated webs of transmission aredoomed to the speculative interpretation of a few sparsetexts, some essays from Henry Corbin, some Nusayri-Alawihadith and legendary traditions. Their hymnal literature(Bar-Asher & Kofsky 2002) is saturated with references toa \"wine of light\" that Corbin (1998) connects with a grail lit-urgy. Corbin's (1989) research also highlights the continuedevolution of a \"celestial botany\" rooted in ancient Persiantraditions, evidenced by the Shia's continued use of termsassociated with a plant of immortality, or haoma. Though theidentity of this plant is unknown, it would propel the adeptthrough a \"visionary geography\" consistent with ancientIranian traditions recast into esoteric Islamic teachings.Whatever the final outcome of the Shia line, hotly dis-puted by the Ismaili and Twelver alike, the Shia Imams broketheir public relationship with the Sufi with the eighth Imamal-Rida. There followed a clear policy change in esotericmatters, with Sufism in Shia context now being referred to asgnosis or \"irfan.\" This was again a pragmatic tactic to cloudesoteric associations and dynamics, as the environment andsentiments towards the Shia from the Sunni grew more andmore hostile and dangerous for the Imams. Some of themore radical {ghulat) cults are linked with \"pagan\" or moreproperly, pre-Islamic traditions of fertility cults. Clearlythere existed a sort of magus or Islamic occult adept/doctoror hakim who personified many of the diverse threads ofesoteric and medical knowledge from all over the MiddleEast. Sufism might be viewed as essentially retaining thetheological implications of the standing-one/lmam/micro-cosm of Shia and Jewish Gnosticism.It may be through these hakims, from their Unani (ofthe Greeks) medicine, that either the ergot technology orthe memory thereof survived and penetrated into variousnearby Islamic and Jewish cults in close proximity. Thealchemical arts associated with the various sects and Imamsand Sufi saints would lend a further dimension to possibleesoteric hermeneutics that reentered Europe when the Arabicalchemists like Jabir (Geber) were translated into Latin. TheEnglish alchemist and Kabbalist Robert Fludd (1574-1637),in addition to his fascination with the pineal gland, seemsto have suspected something of this order in pondering thealembics and retorts. Certainly renaissance magicians likeFludd and Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) might have knownof ergot and knew at least of semen retention and otherTantric arts as suggested by Couliano (1987).^ (see Figure 1)Journal of Psychoactive Drugs495Volume 38 (4), December 2006"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Dannaway, Piper & WebsterBread of Heaven or Wines of LightSHIA MASTERS ANDROAMING ANARCHIST DERVISHESThe \"sacred drift\" of Islamic gnosis, in the various ex-pressions of both Shia and Sufi mystics, clearly mixed withreciprocal influences from Persian and Jewish mystical tradi-tions, much to the irritation of the prevailing orthodoxies.The heretical sects, while framed in history and especiallyto Western scholars through Sunni eyes and polemics, mayjust retain the real secrets of the Shia masters and roaminganarchist dervishes that later formalized into \"proper\" ordersand militias with degree systems and symbolism. Thesefeatures seeped into Masonic lore, possibly from Crusadecontacts between the Knights Templars and the syncreticAlawi who fused the old Syrian astrotheology with Semiticmysticism. It is all these threads of influence that unite underthe Sufi orders associated with Rumi.These cultural exchanges resulted in occasional isolatedoases of cosmological autonomy, such as in Basra, where themystical syncretic Brethem of Purity (or the Ikwhan-al Safa)produced an encyclopedia of medical, alchemical and occultknowledge. These men composed hymns to the Greeks andplaced them on par with their own revealed prophets andeven the Prophet Mohammed himself. Their medicine, calledUnani or \"from the Greeks,\" was an essentially Indo-Iraniansystem that came with the proto-Indo-European invaders ofGreece, only to be refined and instilled with local customsand, no doubt, entheogenic technologies.The progression of Sufism from these early rovinglycanthropic brotherhoods of Indo-Iranian warrior cults(Eliade 1972) into Greek inspired shamans and later mysterycults is by no means linear, nor should it be reduced to apotluck comparative religion exercise.'° What is relevantis to note that the Shia cults, and perhaps Jewish sects withwhich they shared traditions, retained the idea of wheat asthe \"tree of life\" even though it does not really match theBiblical or Koranic descriptions. The pervasive inclusion ofthis motif in the fundamental creation myths of a numberof radical and heretical cults could indicate either the tech-nology of entheogenic ergot was still understood under thesymbolic language of alchemy or that, again, the referencewas gleaned and remembered.Peter Lambom Wilson, via personal correspondence,suggests that the representation of wheat as the \"tree of life\"might stem from Jewish folklore with a connection with Cainand his \"crime\" of agriculture which was refused by God. Hesuggests that the agrarian reality could well symbolize thefall from the relatively care-free days of tending Paleolithicherds; which found similar sympathies a similar outlookis found in the Greek myths as mentioned by Detienne(1944). Wilson further recalls a critical Jewish traditionthat mentions a five grain head of wheat (barley?) which,as he notes, would likely indicate a wild sUam, as cultivatedgrains were selectively cultivated to retain their seeds andthus would have more than five heads. This transition, one fromanimal husbandry to selective cultivation, corresponded witha radical paradigm shift in post Neolithic societies that, asDetienne (1994) notes, becomes expressed in such rituals asthose practiced at Eleusis and in the Gardens of Adonis.THE MYSTICAL AD AM,WHEAT AND SACRED BREADSA particular example suggestive of a technology ofentheogenic ergot comes from the Ismaili or Sevener Shia,through Dr. Bernard Lewis (1938) who translated a manu-script from Egypt called Kitabu'l-idah wa'l-Bayati, by theYemenite da'i Husain ibn 'Aii. The author, (Aii from hereon), asks \"why if the tree was good was Adam forbidden toeat of it, and if bad, why would Allah have it in the Garden?\"The reason, Aii suggests, is that the tree had a dual nature,both good and evil. The good sense of the tree is Ilm Haqiqi,or true knowledge, \"the divulgence of which is forbidden.\"Lewis proceeds to quote other interpretations such as thetree's rank of the Quaim (the Ismaili term for Mahdi, orrepresentation of the Godhead), which brings absolute trueknowledge, and the other suggestion that the tree or wheatis the Wasi (a general term with connotations of learning oror knowledge, here likely pertaining to occult knowledge)of Adam, who brings the Ta'wil, or esoteric interpretationof his (Adam's) Shari'a. The article then suggests that Iblis(the \"devil\" lit. \"frustrated\") poses as a prospective convertto obtain the secrets that Adam has been entrusted with; theparallels abound with Biblical traditions and the implicationsof the offerings of Cain and Abel, and the author states thatIblis spread mischief that ended in the murder of Abel byCain. Lewis records the Ismaili tradition that Iblis is the tree,Adam being forbidden to disclose to him the secret wisdomcontained therein. The argument then continues that the gar-den is a goal of future aspiration for the children of Adam,or a grade or degree of \"da'wa.\" The esoteric explanationthat follows is a beautiful discourse with concepts deeplyreminiscent of Kabala, with a primordial Adam Ruhani, theAdam of spirit who is the demiurgic force that remains freeof the dust of matter.The \"Garden is the 'Alamu'lbda' (or preexisting im-material world in contrast to the earthly garden) in which hewas, together with the remaining seven intelligences\" (Lewis1938). The evil aspect is of the First Emanation (of the Fall,where spirit emanates into the earthly realm; there are sevenintelligences or Words (Kalimat) of Qur'an, 11:35) whereIblis is the evil imagination—or perhaps better a \"perverse\"intellect, something akin to the Kabalistic da'ath—the secreteleventh Sephiroth that like a serpent slithers up the back ofthe Kabalistic Tree of Life. Lewis explains Ali's commentsas being, \"a disclosure of neo-Platonic theories of emanationcodified in a complex system of initiation with degrees andlevels of understanding as well as exploring a number of'heretical' interpretations said to be held by the Ismaili, andhe links certain theological opinions with the Druze.\" ThisJournal of Psychoactive Drugs496Volume 38 (4).

Thecreations of sheikhs and angels follows in various days ofthe week, followed by the seven heavens and mankind andother specifics involved in creation. The fruit and herb treesfollow in the traditional fashion, though this version is quickto identify those faithful to Azazil, the peacock angel, whichare of course the Yezedi. Gabriel follows the command tosequester Adam in the paradise that he might eat of everyfruit and green herb, and \"Only wheat is he not to eat.\" In ashocking twist, Adam eats the wheat, and Ta'us Malak withthe coyness of a divinity asks of Adam, \"Hast thou eaten ofthe wheat?\" Adam denies it, but his swelling belly betrayshim, another consequence mentioned in the Ismaili docu-ment above where the author wonders why this wouldn'tbe true of any species, the explanation of his not having theintestines to deal with the matter thus being insufficient.Daniel Merkur (2000) describes the dust of the threshingfloor as an ordeal poison (i.e., substance used for an initia-tion ordeal), of which a \"swollen belly\" is a symptom. Thetelling poem \"The Granary Roor\" by Rumi further echosthese associations where a donkey/initiate experiences theSufi food of light in that context.In the Yezdi version Adam after consumption is saidto suffer because he has \"no outlet.\" Another bird doesthe dirty of work of instigating such an orifice and Adamhas relief, and even Eve is created from under Adam's leftarmpit, contrasting with Ismaili traditions where she is cre-ated from a bit of clay taken from his foot while sleeping.The suggestion of wheat as the tree is a strange associationfor the obvious reason that wheat is not a tree. The possibleergot connection has not been suggested to the authors'knowledge, but could the traditions or Iranian gnosis havepreserved some entheogenic heritage of which ergotizedwheat was a principle element? Should the Wine of the Magibe similar to the Greek offerings, the kykeon of the Eleusianmysteries, then there is every reason to suggest that this wineand its properties would resonate in the symbolism of grainas staff of life and ritual entheogen.The Islamic story of the Fall is consistent with thatof the the Midrash. \"Now, before Adam's sin, wheat grewupon the finest tree of Paradise. Its trunk was of gold, itsbranches were of silver, and its leaves of emerald. Fromevery branch there sprung seven ears of ruby; each earcontained five grains, and every grain was white as snow,sweet as honey, fragrant as musk, and as large as an ostrich'segg. [Clear references to psychedelic experience] Eve ateone of these grains, and finding it more pleasant than all shehad hitherto tasted, she took a second one and presentedit to her husband. Adam resisted long—our doctors say, awhole hour of Paradise, which means 80 years of our timeon earth; but when he observed that Eve remained fair andhappy as before, he yielded to her importunity at last, andate the second grain of wheat, which she had had constantlywith her, and presented to him three times every day\" (Weil1863). And so, Israel was the land of \"wheat and barley\"(Deuteronomy 8:8). The Biblical and Koranic legends retainthis theme from the Talmud to the Midrash to the Shia andSufi sects of esoteric Islam. If this seems speculative, wehave recourse to the spirit of midrash lit. \"to seek out\" thedeeper meanings of a text. The Koran does not identify thetree but simply says it is forbidden (Koran 2:35).RUMI AND INTOXICATING GRAINSRumi's mystical aspirations can now be seen to be anextension of a broader field of influences that unify underesoteric Islam. Most of what is known of these inspiredmystics is deduced from the rich tradition of Persian wine-mysticism and erotic verse. Rumi has rightly come topersonify the culmination of an extended lineage of ecstaticmysticism that developed, perhaps, just outside the orthodoxconsensus, as the entheogenic experience would negatemuch of the need for formal priests, shaykhs, mullahs ormediators. Rumi's verse can be read as a manual or ritualprompt with each verse having several meanings. As such,the incidences of Rumi's direct references to intoxicatinggrains after sections that proceed with material of a ritualnature could indicate an esoteric relationship.As Rumi's work is quite extensive, it must stiffice torecall the general tone of more ofthe \"esoteric\" poetry. Herethere is a progression that begins with prayer and meditationall composed in verse that slowly ignites the ecstatic zhikr(ritual remembrance).The writings in question are the Odesor Ghazals of his Divan that poured forth with the meeting ofhis perfect other, the mysterious, possibly even nonexistentShams-i-Tabriz in the mid thirteenth century. Verses like\"God has given us a dark wine so potent that, drinking it, weleave the two worlds. God has put into the form hashish apower to deliver the taster from self-consciousness,\" (Barks1997) are not to be dismissed, as some prohibition-mindedscholars would have it, as simple metaphors for a higherspiritual understanding. This is not to deny this interpreta-tion, but merely to validate it on another level, that thesesubstances had benefits.Rumi's verses in the context of rubaiyat that progressfrom meditations of instruments, prayers, reflections andrecitations evolve into higher and higher discourse on thepoetic ecstasy. An altemate translation of a critical Rumipoem is of the \"hidden treasure\" that unlocks the worldswith this verse:Journal of Psychoactive Drugs497Volume 38 (4), December 2006"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Dannaway, Piper & WebsterBread of Heaven or Wines of LightWithin one grain of wheatA thousand stooks complete; Ahundred worlds, that lie Withina needle's eye. (Arberry 1974)The connotations of fire and wine in the following versemight indicate the crimson rust of the infected grain that isexpressed in its liquefied potion form in verses composedafter coming off the all night zhikr vigil:The dawn is not yet up;Ho, bring the morning cup!The wine's bright lamp shall soonOutshine both sun and moon.Fetch me yon liquid flame,Saki,and with the same Set fire tosullen gloom. And let it allconsume. (Arberry 1991)As wine is prohibited to a Muslim, Rumi may be refer-ring to a deliberate violation of Islamic law in the spirit ofbeing God's intimate and drinking partner or that this \"darkwine\" is something entirely different. Given the precedingcontexts of an entheogenic heritage and his own advocacyof divine inebriation, Rumi's metaphors and allusions beginto take on a more specific significance. The following verseis profoundly suggestive of an awareness of and the use ofintoxicating grains:If you bake bread with the wheat Ihat grows on my graveyou'll become drunk wilh joy and even the oven will reciteecstatic poems.If you come to pay your respectseven my gravestone will invite you to dance.so don't come without your drum. (Kolin & Mafi 2001)Rumi's reference to \"a dark wine so potent that, drink-ing it, we leave the two worlds\" (Barks 1997) could refer towine whose potency has been enhanced by the addition ofpsychoactive herbs. The symptoms produced by consump-tion of darnel (grasses, from an old French word Darne,signifying stupefied) being analogous to those of alcoholicintoxication, liquors have been adulterated with darnel toadd to their intoxicating qualities and its continuing usefor this purpose was still suspected in the late nineteenthcentury USA. The Victorian journalist James Greenwoodenumerated a few of the ingredients with which the beer-shop keeper rebrevvs his beer and the publican \"doctors\" hisgin and rum and whisky. These include foxglove, henbane,nux vomica, opium, wormwood and yew leaves. Suchpreparations were not always adulteration or spiking; King'sAmerican Dispensatory includes a recipe for Wine of Ergot,(Vinum Ergotae USP), to be used during labor and in otherinstances, the dose being gradually increased if desirable.The use of intoxicating herbs to enhance or modify theeffect of alcoholic beverages is extremely ancient. In Sufipoetry the wine shops are maintained by Zoroastrians and inthe important Zoroastrian scripture Arda Wiraz Namag theprotagonist visits heaven and hell by means of a narcotic po-tion, wine mixed with mang which was probably henbane orcannabis. According to Gherardho Gnoli this was an integralpart of Zoroastrian ecstatic practice aimed at opening the\"eye of the soul\" and so it was drunk by Arda Wiraz beforehis journey into the other world (Gnoli 1979). The Chinesemade use of wine infused with henbane and cannabis as ananesthetic. In Azerbaijan, a former center of the Zoroastrianreligion and homeland of the cannabis-using Scythians,medieval manuscripts also record the use of wine infusedwith a mixture of cannabis, opium and henbane.Peter Lamborn Wilson's (1999) masterful translationof another Persian poet, Salman Savaji, might indicate thatthis was an insider secret to the highly potent wine of themystics. The \"Drunken Universe\" begins: \"In Preeternityalready the reflection of your ruby wine colored the cup...\"and then \"Lip of the cup crystallize with sugar from yourgarnet lips, the hidden secret of the jug poured out intoEverybody's mouth\" then \"Adam saw the black mole onyour wheat-colored cheek\" all of which might describe theergotized Fall when Eve sampled that fateful grain of wheatrather than the \"fruit.\" This tradition may extend back to themerging of Semitic traditions of \"wines\" with the Saki orcup-bearer tradition of ecstatic wine poets.As well as ergotised wheat there could be a link hereto darnel, a weed that commonly grows among other ctil-tivated grains, the Biblical \"tares.\" It owes its Importanceto its growing amongst cultivated grains, especially wheat.Darnel's ground seeds may be eaten in bread made from thewheat flour contaminated with darnel harvested along withthe wheat grain. From ancient times darnel's seeds have beenknown to produce intoxication similar to that of alcohol,hence its specific Latin name Lolitiiti ireitmlenttim and theFrench name, Ivraie from French ivre which means \"drunk.\"The intoxicating properties of darnel are well known in theMiddle East, particularly to shepherds who must have ob-served the effects of these loco-weeds on their llocks sincetime immemorial. One vernacular Arabic name for darnelmeans \"horse's hashish.\" Darnel has been included in therecipes of Middle Eastern intoxicating compounds such asbars (potent psychoactive compounds usually with cannabisand darnel). The description by Van Linschoten (a sl.xtccnthcentury traveler in the Near East) of the preparation ofbengue, berge, bers (cannabis based compounds of psycho-active plants containing ingredients such as opium, datura,darnel, nux vomica) and soon, includes a mixture of darneland hemp seeds in water called bosa. Such compounds ofpsychoactive vegetable drugs are discussed in some detailin a valuable reference work by Dr. Bellakhdar (1997), LaPharmacopee Marocaitie Traditionttelle: Medecttte ArabeAncienne et Savoirs Populaires. Dr Bellakdhar refers to acouple ofLolium species essentially as locoweeds affectinganimals, but does note that one vernacular name for darnelis also applied to species of Phalaris grass.

If harmal, which containsMAO inhibitors, is mixed with Phalaris, which containsDMT, it produces have a Middle Eastern version of theSouth American hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca.Various untranslated poems and travelogues recordinstances of Sufi hermits subsisting on wild barley and\"burnt grains.\" Both Dr. Bellakdhar and Maud Grieve (1971)agree that that it is uncertain whether the psychoactivityof Lolium is due to the plant's own chemistry or it beingergotized. Ergot is not the only fungal infection of grasses.Another fungal infection of the ears of maize, wheat, oats,and barley, and also various grasses, Ustilago segetum, iscalled bumt-ear. Ustilago has decided activity, its effectshaving been compared with those of ergot and nux vomicacombined. It has been hypothesized that the Salem Witchaffair was initiated because individuals ate bread productsfrom ergot-infected rye. This caused the symptoms attributedto bewitchment. \"Bumt grains\" might refer to the process ofbeer making where malted grain is roasted before making upthe mash (hough this doesn't rule out the role of ergotised\"beer\"). Peter Webster questions the efficacy or even logicof the process of the fermentation of ergotised grains to pro-duce an entheogenic brew.'* However, Thomas Reidlinger(2(X)2) has presented a theory that suggests both Greek andEgyptian knowledge and use of ergotized beers for ecstaticritual theophany, though beer is really a misnomer as theactual process ends before fermentation.The Sufi bands of roaming dervishes in many waysresemble the pre-Chrisitan fertility cults described by CarloGinzburg (1991) in his Ecstasies: Deciphering the WitchesSabbath. The possibility of the ergot technology survivingamongst certain tribal cults convinced Ginzburg, who seesthe erotic ecstasies of the \"witches\" as being possibly ergotinduced. The parallels would then extend to the rebelliouscounter-culture of both \"pagan\" and \"dervish\" as beingthe antithesis of the prevailing pious faith, with the latterbeing called \"God's Unruly Friends\" (Karamustafa 1994).Their botanical knowledge, including the known and usualsuspects of the Solanaceae family as well as opium andhashish, might well extend in their ritual pharmacopoeia toergotized grains.CONCLUSIONFieldwork in I^banon in the 1950s would even suggestthat some cults retained the entheogenic use of ergot (Phillips1958). Informants told Phillips that certain sects used ergot\"to produce visions, or induce trances in some rites.\" Sheapparently pressed for details, \"But they refused to explain.\"Phillips records similar statements for Peganum Harmalaand Datura as used in ecstatic religious ceremonies. Thisserves as a precedent for these arguments, especially in aShia Islamic country, for either the continued use of theLSD-like potions or at least the dim recollection of ergot'sentheogenic and holy status that then permeates esotericcults even up to a fairly late period, such as these examplesof mysticism that derive from primarily Greek, Jewish andPersian sources. The remarkable scholarship of Dr. Ruckand Dr. Merkur lend credence and provide a context for thecontinued use of sacramental infusions of ergotized grain.Merkur's work, in particular, details Kabbalists and mysticsthat continued the sacred traditions of the \"manna\" intothe modern era. While these Sufi deductions are perhapsspeculative they are not any more so than the understandingthat Merkur uses of the wheat and the tares and the \"hiddentreasure\" and the subsequent mentioning of similar themes inthe Biblical and apocryphal texts, which he gives judicioustreatment.'^PART 2: ERGOT AS ENTHEOGENIt was over 20 years ago that I first came across the linesof Rumi's Masnavi I Ma'navi reproduced at the beginningof the preceding essay by Frederick Dannaway and AlanPiper. Immediately upon reading them it seemed a goodguess that the medieval Sufi poet's reference to wheat asthe forbidden fruit betrayed a still-lingering knowledge ofone of the oldest and longest-enduring religious rites everpracticed, the yearly autumnal celebrations at Eleusis inancient Greece. At that time. The Road to Eleusis (Wasson,Hofmann & Ruck 1978) had just recently been published,describing in detail a new theory about the Eleusinian Mys-teries, and suggesting ergot as the long-secret component ofthe psychoactive beverage of the Celebrations, the kykeon.For a long time, however, I was unable to follow up mysuspicion with further evidence, and even when in the early1990s I decorated the homepage of the Psychedelic Library(http://www.psychedelic-library.org/) with Rumi's lines nextto a head of grain infested with ergot {Claviceps purpurea),it attracted no comment or confirmation.Only in the past year have I finally met Frederick Dan-naway and Alan Piper thanks to the ever-widening \"friendof a friend\" web of Internet communications and found thatreferences to wheat as the forbidden fruit are not at all rare.Quite the contrary. As we may infer from the previous essaysuch references may constitute further significant evidencesupporting the Wasson, Hofmann and Ruck hypothesis, thatthe enlightening beverage consumed at the Eleusis Celebrationwas a psychoactive preparation made from ergotised grain.The suggestion that ergot may have been a psychoac-tive constituent of a sacramental beverage or preparationhas understandably been met with criticism, even totaldisbelief. A major problem, of course, is that this commonparasite of food grains such as barley, rye, and wheat is toxic,sometimes extremely so in years when high alkaloid pro-duction is favored by ideal weather conditions. The historyof medieval plagues of ergotism are seen as evidence thatC. purpurea could hardly have been used as an otherwisebenign psychoactive agent.Journal of Psychoactive Drugs499Volume 38 (4). December 2006"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dannaway, Piper & WebsterBread of Heaven or Wines of LightSince the publication of The Road to Eleusis over a quar-ter-century ago, scholarly opinion on the matter has divideditself into three camps: those who dismiss outright the ideathat consciousness-altering drugs have been part and parcelof humankind's religious and social evolution since earliesttimes; those who admit the evidence of such a scenario butbelieve ergot could not have been suitably psychoactive andat the same time safe; and those of a third group who havetried to extend and improve upon the original suggestionsof Wasson, Hofmann, and Ruck.The first group of scholars—classicists, anthropolo-gists, chemists, religious leaders and scholars, professorsof various disciplines, et al.—although they are apparentlya large majority of those who claim some expertise on suchmatters, may be dismissed completely as being sadly andwillfully ignorant of the great body of evidence showing theessential and necessary connection of consciousness-alteringplants and the entire history and prehistory of the humanrace. Whether these scholars have fallen under the spell ofthat great twentieth century crowd madness and destroyerof clear thinking, prohibitionism and support for the \"waron drugs,\" is an interesting hypothesis to be tested. But wecan be certain that seeing drugs as the scourge of human-ity has led to no small number of experts demonstrating amonumental narrow-mindedness concerning other scholars'work on the subject.That fact of the matter is: the seeking of altered statesof consciousness (ASCs) is a human universal as definedby the anthropologist Donald E. Brown (1991). Far frombeing a perversion or abnormal activity as today's prohi-bitionist mentality would have it, using intoxicants in thepursuit of altered consciousness is a biologically natural andnormal behavior, and very likely has adaptive evolution-ary value (Siegel 1989; Weil 1972). Such a universal andpowerful drive is not even humanity's own, for it has mostpersuasively been shown by Giorgio Samorini (2000) thatseeking out and ingesting consciousness-altering drugs isan important pursuit that appears across the entire animalkingdom, and thus we humans are the mere inheritors ofthis instinctive primary motivational force. So much forthose who pine for a \"drug-free\" society, science, history,evolution, and religion.The second group—those who are well aware ofthe importance of psychoactive drugs throughout historyand prehistory but who question ergot's possible role anduse—have suggested various other candidates for the Eleusissacrament, the kykeon. I have countered their criticisms ofthe ergot hypothesis, and their suggestions for alternativepsychoactive agents elsewhere (Webster, Perrine & Ruck2000), and need not repeat those arguments here. Whatconcerns me here is to restate and elaborate on certainobservations I made in the above-cited article, particularlyin reference to more recently presented ideas about otherpossible ways ergot might have been prepared for sacra-mental purposes. (Reidlinger 2002; Pyle ca. 2001). And inlight of the accumulating evidence for the ergot hypothesisof which the first part of this article is an important newdevelopment, my objective is to attempt to bring someconsensus among our group of researchers—the thirdabove-mentioned camp—concerning the most likely andmost parsimonious hypotheses for producing a suitablypsychoactive preparation from ergot. If the means to conductsome experimentation on these questions arise, hypothesessuch as these should of course be the first to be tested. Asit will be seen, these hypotheses are also very easy to test,more so than those of Reidlinger and Pyle.Albert Hofmann had originally suggested in The Road toEleusis that a simple water-extraction of C. purpurea mighthave accomplished a separation of the toxic alkaloids of thefungus (the ergopeptines) from the much smaller fractionof a simpler, water-soluble lysergic acid amide, ergonovine,which does apparently have some psychoactive activity,albeit somewhat disputed. Such a process, it was noted,would eliminate the toxicity of whole ergot.In a more complex hypothesis, Reidlinger (2002)proposes that the kykeon might have been produced via a\"double-decoction\" process similar to a recently discoveredbeer-making technique used in ancient Egypt. I need notcriticize Reidlinger's very imaginative and well-researchedideas—they certainly are worth pursuing experimentallyif the opportunity arises—except to say that they haveone major problem: the result of the process would stillleave ergonovine as the essential psychoactive agent in thepreparation. As Reidlinger himself notes, the self-tests byHofmann with ergonovine leave considerable doubt as to itspossible candidacy as an entheogen of sufficient and suit-able effect to have resulted in a 2000-year history of highlysuccessful use. Reidlinger is right on-track, however, in hisobservation that the toxic alkaloids of ergot—the ergopep-tines of which ergotamine usually predominates—are theprimary problem: they can cause ergotism, spontaneousabortion, and are not at all suitably psychoactive. Somehowthey must have been excluded from the kykeon.Another problem for the hypothesis that ergonovinewas the psychoactive agent of the kykeon is that it is only aminor and quite variable constituent in the alkaloid mixtureproduced by C. purpurea., with alkaloid production itselfquite variable according to weather conditions. C. purpureaproduction on barley (as opposed to rye) also appears tofavor the ergopeptine (toxic) alkaloids, vvith ergonovinebeing even less present. (Kren & Cvak 1999) Thus simplewater-extraction of ergot, or Reidlinger's double decoctionprocess, would both have been—year-to-year—processesvery unlikely to be reliable and reproducible, certainly notsomething that worked without a fault for 2000 years in arow.I would add just one further note on Reidlinger's ar-ticle. He certainly overestimates the toxicity of ergot andergotamine when he suggests that the lack of trials with ergotaccording to these extraction recipes might be because of theJournal of Psychoactive Drugs500Volume 38 (4), December 2006"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Dannaway, Piper & WebsterBread of Heaven or Wines of Lightfearof toxic effects by potential experimenters. Ergotamineis widely used for various medical conditions (I myselfuse if for migraine) and it is well-established how muchergotamine one may take without risk, and how frequently.Also, it is well-established how much ergotamine may becontained in a sclerotia of ergot, so knowing these detailswould easily enable one to prepare a trial kykeon fromergot and sample it without risk, even if one did nothingto remove or otherwise neutralize the toxic components.More likely, in my opinion, those who might have tested aprocedure for making a kykeon simply did not have a hy-pothesis convincing enough to them to merit carrying out atrial. Their hypotheses were more like preliminary stabs inthe dark awaiting more concrete ideas for instructions for akykeon recipe.Another hypothesis as to how ergot might have beenused has been proposed by Pyle (2001-2002), who suggeststhat ergot may have been fermented in solution to producelysergic acid alkaloids. Indeed, with the increasing pharma-ceutical demand for these products in the twentieth century,fermentation processes were developed to produce lysergicacid and several of its amides in saprophytic culture—theergot mycelium being grown in nutrient-rich solutions toproduce alkaloids without the sclerotia or fruiting bodies ofergot ever appearing. But these processes are highly techni-cal, and the alkaloids produced are highly dependent on theisolation of certain sometimes rare strains of the fungus,requirements beyond the capabilities ofthe ancient Greeksto be sure. It may be possible to effect some fermentationof C. purpurea in a simple barley broth, but even if alka-loids were produced, they would still be primarily the toxicergopeptines, with ergonovine as a possible minor productand the only candidate for possible psychoactivity. So wearrive back at the same problems we have as above.Our own hypothesis for an ergot recipe, described in\"Mixing the Kykeon\" (Webster, Perrine & Ruck 2000), over-comes all these problems. Unlike suggestions for alternativepsychoactives such as Psilocybe or opium made by some,it remains true to much of the evidence first presented inThe Road to Eleusis, it overcomes the problem of toxicityof the ergopeptine alkaloids, and it does not depend on thedisputed psychoactivity of ergonovine. The only way tomake the alkaloids of ergot safe and psychoactive at the sametime, and also to employ the major fraction of alkaloids (theotherwise toxic ergopeptines) is to process the ergot in a waythat leads to the conversion of the ergopeptines to the simpleamides ergine and isoergine. These two amides, mirror-im-ages (epimers) of each other and always in approximate50/50 equilibrium in solution, are the principal componentof the ancient Central American entheogen ololiuqui, whosepsychoactive properties cannot be in doubt. Referencesshowing the fact of this conversion and under what condi-tions it occurs, and discussion of the distinct possibility thatthe ancient Greeks may well have discovered it (the partialhydrolysis of ergopeptine alkaloids) may be found in ourarticle.1 mentioned above that this hypothesis is the easiestto test. It would suffice for preliminary results to digestpowdered ergot with wood ash and water (as described inour essay). Trials would use various concentrations of ash,at various temperatures and for various lengths of time,and analyze the alkaloid spectrum and its changes usingthin-layer chromatography. This would be very easy andeconomical to do. Once the optimum conditions had beenestablished where the maximum conversion of the ergopep-tines to ergine/isoergine was achieved, a trial kykeon couldbe prepared and tested without risk.As a preliminary to these experiments, I have alreadymade some self-trials using not whole ergot, but my anti-migraine medication. As mentioned above, this medicationcontains per tablet lmg of ergotamine tartrate, the principal\"toxic\" ergopeptine in ergot. Note that one is allowed amaximum dose of five tablets—5mg of ergotamine—inone 24-hour period, and a maximum of lOmg per week. Atthe 5mg level one definitely feels strong vasoconstrictiveeffects in one's extremities: cold hands and feet, even sometingling and formication. Yet at this dose there is absolutelyno psychoactive effect, of course. The sometimes psychoac-tive effect of ergot with victims of ergotism required thatone eat ergot-infested bread continuously for days, at quitea high dose; at this level the \"psychoactivity\" was not at allpsychedelic or entheogenic, but totally infernal and often suicidal.However, performing three trials with lmg, 2mg, and3mg of ergotamine, digested and heated with wood ash andwater as per the recipe, I found definite psychoactivity inthe resulting preparation. I would caution any who wouldlike to repeat these trials that significant and prolongedgastric cramps were experienced as a side effect, and thusthe recipe would surely need to be refined before the ex-perience was one to be valued and repeated. It is a distinctpossibility that the pennyroyal mint added to the originalkykeon functioned to quell any such gastric disturbances.To discourage nonscholarly experimentation, I have alsorefrained from divulging two other essential conditions ofmy preparation using ergotamine tablets.NOTESI. See Wasson, Hofmann and Ruck 1978. There is,as nearly every scholar I have spoken with on the subjectconfirms, a profound sense of frustration at the difficultiesin resolving the speculative nature of these affairs by ananalytical chemist. Those scholars that favor a \"mono-plant\"theory, especially in the case of ergot, remain subject to criti-cism until this issue is resolved. This article is speculative,like all nascent theories, but when the confluence of associa-tions is so prominent in the ancient world then this tends tofurther support the entheogenic technology of ergot.Journal of Psychoactive Drugs501Volume 38 (4), December 2006"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Dannaway, Piper & WebsterBread of Heaven or Wines of Light2. See Merkur 2000, Wasson, Kramrisch, Ott & Ruck1992 and Greene 1992 for the various ergot theories. AsCorbin's (1989) research illustrates, the Shia maintained aspecific plant-based angelic correspondence adapted fromthe Indo-Iranian haoma-soma complex. See coauthor AlanPiper's (2002) contextual work on Islamic entheogens.3. Jewish poet and scholar Rodger Kamenetz writes \"Ina midrash we read, \"What kind of tree did Adam and Eveeat of? Wheat, according to Rabbi Meir.\" (vvvvw.shalomctr.org/node/234) He explained that bread made of wheat sym-bolizes wisdom. \"R. Samuel put the following question toR. Ze'era: 'How can you say it was a grain wheat?' 'Nev-ertheless it was so,' R. Ze'era replied. R. Samuel argued:'But scripture speaks of a tree.' R. Ze'era replied, 'In thegarden of Eden stalks of wheat were like trees, for they grewto the height of cedars of Lebanon.' Perhaps Rabbi Ze'erawas growing a tall tale, but R. Meir understood, that breadsymbolizes wisdom.\"4. The position of ergot as poison, medicine, aphrodisiacand entheogen might color many religious doctrines thatemerged with the dawn of agriculture. The \"Gnostic Trace\"of an elite priesthood, who knew which grains to use andhow to do so safely, would theologically justify or informsuch ideas born of the agricultural philosophies of the fieldsof selective cultivation (elite, chosen), to the divine plan.5. As Webster's paper illustrates, there is some skillneeded in safely using such a potentially toxic substance.Until a single bioassay is completed of an entheogenic useof ergot, all this research is speculative.6. More than a few scholars have dealt with this verse offorbidden fruits as an allusion to the dragon's tail eclipsingthe moon. \"In Sufism the dragon relates two astronomicalnodes, two diametrically opposed points of intersectionbetween the moon and the sun. Its head is the ascendingnode, its tail the descending node. An eclipse can only occurwhen both sun and moon stand at the nodes. To the mystic,the dragon symbolizes the place of encounter between themoon and the sun within. The dragon can either devour themoon, seen symbolically as the mystic's spiritual heart,or it can serve as the place or container of conception. Byentering the dragon when the sun is in the nodes, the moonor the heart conceives. Thus, in full consciousness of theperils, one must enter the dragon to await the eclipse in itscosmic womb.\" (Bakhtiar 2005).7. The Arabic version is referenced a little differently,so for ease, see Barks, 1997, p. 181 for the teaching narrative\"The Importance of Gourdcrafting\" wherein a maidservantwitnesses her mistress taking extreme license with a donkey.Wishing to imitate her, the maidservant takes the donkey'smember, only without the necessary protective gourd thatkept the erection \"within bounds.\" The maidservant's severeinternal damage from the no doubt significant organ is meantto caution the onlookers of the Sufi from imitating theirextreme and dangerous practices.8. For this discussion of Sufi Shia relations see the workof Seyyed Nasr (1999, 1993).9. See Barks 1997 for granary floor/initiation that evenin translation and abstracted retains a central context similarto ideas expressed by Merkur. See Eisenman (1998) for adiscussion on the extended lore and legacy of the Imam/Standing-One/Hidden One that he connects from Old Tes-tament Judaism through early Christian sects and Gnosticsto Manicheans and into Shia Islam. Corbin (1998) suggeststhat the Islamic mystics influenced and formed the Kabala,not the other way around.10. A query was passed to the Entheogen Review, whichwas then circulated to such entheogen luminaries as Ott,Samorini, Shulgin, etc. and none could cite a single bioassayof aqueous extraction of ergot, let alone one that producesthe effects consistent with ritual inebriation. Perhaps somehave tried and never lived to report their findings.The toxicity of ergotized grains presents unique prob-lems for these otherwise very convincing and often poetictheories. Mott Greene in his argument of the Soma as moreof a function of the religious ecstasy represented across abroad range of ergot infected plants finds grasses actuallynamed Soma in Sanskrit, Eteusine coracana. Greene (1992)quotes from Nadkarni's Materia Medica \"The new grain issaid to be powerfully narcotic and is eaten only by the poorwho prepare it in various ways and from use are able to useit with impunity.\" He suggests this means ihey avoid ergot-ism. We wonder if this is a gastronomic clue suggesting thatancient cultures and perhaps then modern poor or isolatedgroups such as in the mountains of Lebanon, through con-tinued use and exposure to ergot had a tolerance or naturalresistance to the toxic effects.11. Conceming suggestions that the ancients might havebeen able to ferment ergot to produce a psychoactive beer,i.e., grow the ergot mycelium in a broth so that alkaloidswere produced in the process, today's scientific literatureabout how ergot is grown in saprophytic culture to producelysergic acid alkaloids would seem to cast serious doubt onthat possibility. The studies reveal several technical difficul-ties that would have been very difficult if not impossiblefor preindustrial people to overcome. A specially selectedand difficult to isolate strain of ergot is required to get anysignificant yield of alkaloid at all. Modern microbiologialmethods and equipment are required to succeed in this en-deavor. Techniques for selecting, propagating, inoculating,and growing the ergot mycelium in culture, the specifics ofthe nutrient broth, and other commercial matters are subjectto patents and are valuable trade secrets developed overyears by modern chemists and microbiologists. In addition,even if Claviceps purpurea were somehow successfullyfermented by simple techniques, this ergot does not producepsychoactive alkaloids but rather the ergopeptine spectrumof alkaloids related to ergotamine. These alkaloids are thetoxic ergotism-producing ones.

The process would not be growing orfermenting the ergot mycelium but merely converting thealready-present toxic alkaloids to the ergine-isoergine mix-ture in a manner similar to the wood-ash recipe we suggest.Indeed, in a private communication, Vladimir Krcn ol' theCzech Institute of Microbiology informs us that the ergota-mine-type alkaloids can be partially hydrolyzed by cerlainsoil bacteria and enzymes, so there may well be more thanone way the ancients could have converted the toxic alka-loids of C. purpurea to the psychoactive ones.REFERENCESArberry.
