As he stated: ‘All of Russia is your statue,from you it is recast... and in your emblem it is not falsely portrayed’1. Thetheme of the Tsar as a “wise architect” is also expounded by many of theleading propagandists of the Petrine era, such as Feofilakt Lopatinskii andGavrilla Buzhinskii, who described him as a “wise builder” and a “kind archi-tect” and as the all wise and first architect building the Russian state2.The symbolic representation of Peter hewing, or sculpting, the statue ofRussia has obvious strong Masonic resonances. Indeed, Douglas Smith enti-tled his recent study on Russian Freemasonry, Working the Rough Stone, inreference to the general aim of Russian Freemasons, which was to reshapea rough stone so that its original state became unrecognisable3. No longercovered with unhewn and jagged surfaces, it was to be ‘scoured, planed...and smoothed out’4. No mention was made by Smith to Peter the Great inthis regard, yet this is one of the most frequent symbolic metaphors used topraise the Tsar during his reign.Moreover, it is highly likely that Peter the Great himself devised this sym-bolic metaphor, as he adopted it for use in his personal stamp in 1710 or1711(fig. 1)5. On the print, the Tsar is portrayed with a hammer and chisel in hishands and a crown on his head. Agown is on the shoulders of the statue of“Russia” with a sceptre and orb in her hands and a crown on her head.To the right, two classical columns are clearly visible; in the sky is a cloudand portrayed in it is a triangular “all-seeing-eye”, containing the HebrewARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2ROBERTCOLLISFig. 1.

The two words in combination read as “with God’s help” andsignify the divinely sanctioned nature of the Tsar’s mission as a Mason-Kingsculpting his country into a perfected form.In addition, the print of Peter the Great as the sculptor of the statue ofRussia, judging by its description in literature, was also three-sided6. On thesecond side was portrayed a two-headed eagle (the Imperial emblem ofRussia), under three crowns. Furthermore, a breast shield was portrayed witha rider and the sign of the Order of Andrew the First Named was suspendedto the shield without chains. On the third side was an “all-seeing-eye” andunder it was an arm reaching out of a cloud, holding a crown inscribed withthe Latin motto “Dat et Aufert” (Give and Reward). Peter used this personalstamp consistently up until at least 1720 and it also played an important rolein the celebrations held in the wake of the Nystad Peace of 1721. Intriguinglyhere, however, it is Peter himself who is being carved by a worker-masonand at the top the triangle does not contain the name of God, but three “7’s”,a highly symbolic reference to the fact that the Great Northern War spannedtwenty-one years and was divided into three significant periods—a fact seenas divinely preordained by Russian officials, such as Prokopovich and Peterhimself (fig. 2).In this regard, one can note the speech delivered by Prokopovich at theUspenskii Cathedral in Moscow on 30th August 1721 (OS), to mark the con-clusion of the peace with Sweden.

Prokopovich then elaborateson this theme by stating:Did we not receive Divine reward in the Trinity in the preceding war, since theTrinity was formed by the rewards of triumph?... But since the number of theTrinity—as in Holy Scripture, so also in the actions of people—often tends touse considerable prime numbers (about which there is not space now to con-verse), and we complete the triple monarchical decree and the rewards of thecouncil of triumph thanks to this... we recognise, from this, that daily andincessantly and eternally we are obliged for thanks from up high,... the pre-ceding war in question and the peace were established by blessing from the allgenerous right hand of his adopted children7.Peter the Great also went to great lengths to orchestrate celebrations of theNystad Peace based on the symbolic length of the war in relation to the HolyTrinity. He ensured that the Peace was announced from the Trinity Cathedralin St. Petersburg on September 4th 1721 (OS) whilst three cannon shotsresounded from the nearby St. Peter and Paul Fortress. The Tsar also stated:ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4ROBERTCOLLIS8Zhurnal, 1770-1772, Vol. I, 175.9Cf.

See Grebeniuk,Panigiricheskaia, 63.13Driessen, Tsar Petr, 103-04.‘Since the thrice seven length of the war; it is then necessary to give thanksto the Lord God thrice everywhere as in St. Petersburg’8. This required allmunicipalities to organise three celebrations: (1) as soon as the news reachesthem, (2) on October 22nd 1721 (OS) and (3) on January 28th 1722 (OS),which coincided with the religious Maslenitsa, or Shrove Tuesday, festival.The two columns visible in the motif of Peter as a “Mason-King” can beinterpreted as the pillars of Jachin and Boaz. Indeed, according to Masoniclegend, these pillars can be linked to the rule of the House of David inJerusalem. ‘He (Yahweh) will establish the throne of David, and his king-dom to his seed for ever’. Legend also has it that the coronations of laterkings of the Davidic dynasty took place at these pillars9. It is significant,therefore, that panegyric literature, plays and triumphal parades provide plen-tiful evidence of a concerted effort, from at least as early as 1704, to sym-bolise the Russian monarch as a new King David building a new House ofIsrael. This symbolism is entirely resonant of the Davidic-Solomonic mythof Freemasonry, as outlined in the Old Charges, which states that King Davidbegan to build the temple in Jerusalem and loved masons, giving themcharges according to Euclid10.The theme of David defeating Goliath is a popular and consistent themein panegyrics, acting as a metaphor for Peter’s triumphs over the Swedishmonarch, Charles XII in the Great Northern War. Prokopovich, for example,stated in one panegyric that Peter was striking at the head of the new Goliathand was carrying the Russian nation—God’s living regiment—towards a NewIsrael11. Further popular themes included linking the Tsar’s close friendshipwith Alexander Menshikov to King David’s bond with Jonathan, as describedin the Book of Samuel12. It seems likely that this biblical comparison wasendorsed by the Tsar himself, as the Dutch scholar Jozien Driessen hasrecently argued that the painting “The Parting of David and Jonathan” (1642)by Rembrandt (fig. 3), which hangs in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, waspurchased by the Tsar whilst in Holland in 171613.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRYAND THE OCCULTATTHE COURTOF PETER THE GREAT5Fig. 3.The Parting of David and Jonathan(1642), Rembrandt, The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.14Grebeniuk, Panigiricheskaia, 66.The betrayal by the Cossack Hetman, Ivan Mazepa prior to the Battle ofPoltava in 1709 was also directly compared by the Slavonic-Greek-LatinAcademy in 1710 to Absalom’s conspiracy against David, his father14.Undoubtedly, the most developed use of the symbolic metaphor of Peteras a new King David can be found in two panegyrics by Gavrilla Buzhinskii,the Chaplain of the Fleet and a staunch supporter of the Petrine reforms. Ina speech delivered in 1714 to honour a Russian naval victory, Buzhinskiiused the occasion to quote extensively from the first book of Chronicles andthe first book of Kings. From Chronicles he chose chapter twenty-eight, inwhich David stands before his people and declares how ‘I had in mine heartto build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord and for thefootstool of our God, and had made ready for the building’. Furthermore, in1719, to mark the seventeenth anniversary of the taking of the Swedishfortress of Schlüsselberg, Buzhinskii gave a speech entitled “Key to the Houseof David”. In this speech, he describes how the Swedish fortress ofSchlüsselberg was considered impregnable, but that to the Russian “Houseof David” was given the key and the sacristan and that ‘the pious monarch’ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6ROBERTCOLLIS15Stefan Iavorskii, in a speech made on the name day of the Tsar, referred to the city as‘newly crowned... a place of particular wonder’. See Vedomosti, Vol. II, 258. GavrillaBuzhinskii spoke of St. Petersburg as city in which ‘God is clearly disposed’. See Grebeniuk,Panigiricheskaia, 80. Feofilakt Lopatinskii cited Psalm 147 when speaking at a ceremony tocelebrate the Nystadt Peace in January 1722 (OS). See Grebeniuk, Panigiricheskaia, 255.16Pisma i Bumagi, Vol. IV, 207.17Baehr, The Paradise Myth, 69.Peter I, had unlocked the castle. He then quotes from Isaiah 22:22: ‘the keyof the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, andnone shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open’.The theme of Peter as a new King David consequently entailed that thenew city he built on the River Neva was symbolically seen as a NewJerusalem—and not merely as many have noted as a secular New Amsterdamor an Imperial New Rome. Buzhinskii was most explicit in referring toPetersburg as a New Jerusalem, when he spoke in 1717 in praise of the cityand quoted from Isaiah: ‘Shine, shine new Jerusalem! God’s glory illumi-nating thee’. Other notable ecclesiastic figures referred directly to the city as“newly crowned”, as a “place of particular wonder”, and as a city in whichGod is well disposed, citing the words of Psalm 147: ‘Praise the Lord, OJerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. For he hath strengthened the bars of thygates; he hath blessed thy children within thee’15. Peter the Great also fre-quently referred to the city as his “Paradise” and “Eden”. Evidence of thiscan be found in a number of letters he wrote to Alexander Menshikov, suchas one dated April 7th 1706 (OS):I cannot omit to write to you from this Paradise where, with the help of theAlmighty, everything is fine... We may be living in heaven here; only we mustnever forget, as you know yourself, to place our hope not in man but in the willand grace of God16.Menshikov too, when writing to the Tsar, described the new city as the “prom-ised land”17.The clear sense in which key members of the Petrine hierarchy, includingthe Tsar himself, viewed his mission in biblical terms has never been fullyexamined. No doubt this has something to do with the continuing assump-tion that the reforms carried out by Peter the Great were implemented on aWestern model characterised by secular and rational thinking. Even in thecurrent post Soviet climate this supposition has not been significantly revised.Thus, whilst some historians have recently highlighted the fact that Peterthe Great held a strong private faith, this has been tempered by stressing theARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRYAND THE OCCULTATTHE COURTOF PETER THE GREAT718Ryan, The Bathhouse at Midnight, 1999, 23.19Asummary of these two legends can be found in Pipin, Masonstvo v Rossii, 83.20Cross, ‘British Freemasons’, 43.fact that religion played no part in determining his approach towards reform-ing the Russian state. Even more pronounced in existing literature is the sen-timent that the Petrine Court was a safe-haven from the occult and esoteric.For example, W.F. Ryan, in his recent historical survey of magic in Russia,entitled Midnight at the Bathhouse(the first such work in English) givesshort shrift to the issue of the occult during the reign of Peter the Great. Hestates:Peter’s practicality belonged more to the Enlightenment than to the seventeenthcentury and there are few traces in him or his court of the occult interests ofhis father Tsar Aleksei and his sister Sofia... There is no evidence that thesesubjects interested him as anything more than offences against good order andmanifestations of discontent18.It is widely accepted, therefore, that interest in the occult and mysticism onlyresurfaced in Russia with the emergence of Rosicrucian Freemasonry, intro-duced in 1782 by the German J.G. Schwarz and soon embraced by the promi-nent Muscovite writer and printer, Nikolai Novikov. The birth of RussianFreemasonry, closely affiliated to the Hanoverian system in England, can beofficially traced back to 24th January 1731 (OS), when the minutes of theGrand Lodge in London recorded the appointment of John Phillips asProvincial Grand Master of Russia and Germany. Arguably a more significantstep occurred in 1740, when James Keith was appointed Grand Master solelyof Russia. This accepted chronology of events surrounding the introductionof Freemasonry on Russian soil discounts the legends recited by RussianFreemasons of the latter part of the eighteenth century and the beginning ofthe nineteenth century, which champion Peter the Great as Russia’s firstFreemason.There are two principal legends. Firstly, that Peter the Great was initiatedinto the Masonic Brotherhood by Christopher Wren whilst residing in Englandin 1698 and secondly, that when Peter departed after his second Europeantour in 1717, he carried a Masonic statute with the authority to found alodge19. The validity of these legends is dismissed by modern commentators,such as the respected British scholar Anthony Cross, who states: ‘Peter theFreemason... would seem to be essentially the creation of later generationsof Russian masons’20.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8ROBERTCOLLIS21Letter of 24th January 1706 (OS): The British Library, Stafford Papers, Add.

For example, in addition to portrayinghimself as a New David and a Mason King, Peter also had a definite likingfor secretive Brotherhoods and chivalrous orders. The presence of some formof Brotherhood at the Russian Court seems to be confirmed by CharlesWhitworth, the official British Resident in Moscow, who wrote in 1706 ofa ‘Brotherhood... as true as pleasant’, in which ‘a great glass of winesanctified the occasion’21. As regards chivalrous Orders, one should note thatin 1697 the Tsar corresponded with Raymond Perellos, the Grand Master ofthe Maltese Order of Knights, writing a letter of recommendation for one ofhis principle military figures, Boris Sheremetev22. When he reached Malta,Sheremetev was initiated into the Order and took part in a ceremonial ban-quet to honour John the Baptist. Furthermore, on his return to Moscow inFebruary 1699, the Tsar honoured him at a banquet and permitted him topermanently wear his Maltese Cross23. Peter the Great also founded a RussianOrder—the Order of St. Andrew (the First Named)—directly after his returnfrom his first Grand Embassy in 1698. It would seem that his decision wasinfluenced by his observation of a ceremony of the Order of the Garter atWindsor Castle in England.Peter the Great also displayed a marked religious tolerance and a passionfor scientific inquiry wholly in line with the ethos of Freemasonry as it devel-oped during the seventeenth century and into the eighteenth century. His reli-gious toleration can be clearly seen, for example, on his first Grand Embassyin 1697 and 1698, when he and his retinue visited the Reformed Churchesand Synagogues of Amsterdam. In England, the Tsar personally visited andtook part in services at Quaker Meeting Houses in Gracechurch Street inLondon and in Deptford, and he requested plans for educational reform fromFrancis Lee of the Philadelphian Society. He also met the liberal Bishop ofSalisbury, Gilbert Burnet, on a number of occasions and in one of these meet-ings the pair discoursed for over four hours on scriptural matters24.The Tsar also exuded a scientific curiosity, deeply imbued with religiousmeaning and occult tendencies.

Peter the Great’s stance vis-à-visastronomy is crystallised by remarks he is credited to have made ata Paris Observatory in 1717, where he makes plain his belief in the divinenature of the universe:Here for the eyes are opened a book of the miracles of God, which clearly showsthe great wisdom of Creation!... I would advise the Godless and free thinkersto study astronomy and to be a little more often at the observatory, when theearthly sphere is not sufficient to convince them and when they wander throughit blindly25.The Tsar’s enthusiastic interest in the macrocosmos was equally matched byhis passion for natural curiosities and monstrosities engendered in the earthlymicrocosmos. He made sure to visit every possible Cabinet of Rarities onhis travels and negotiated the purchase of the renowned collections of AlbertSeba and Frederick Ruysch, after visiting their Cabinets in Amsterdam. Thesecollections formed a considerable part of the St. Petersburg Kunstkamera,founded by the Tsar in 1714. Arevealing insight into the Tsar’s views on thehuman monstrosities on display within Russia’s first public museum can begleaned from a decree he wrote in 1718:There is only one creator of all creation, and that is God. And the Evil One hasno power over any living creatures. For monsters are the result of internal dam-age, of fear and the thoughts of the mother during her pregnancy26.The Tsar was also keen to witness chemical experiments on his foreign trav-els, which included the Paracelsian alchemist Moses Stringer demonstratingthe art of separation in London in 1698 and certain ‘curious chemical con-coctions’formed by Louis Lemery in Paris in 1717. Whilst visiting an exper-imental scientist in The Hague in the same year, the Tsar is reported to havemade the following intriguing statement:I neither belittle nor revile an alchemist, the search for converting metal intogold, of the mechanic trying to find eternal movement... such type of peopleshould be encouraged in every way, and not despised27.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10ROBERTCOLLIS28See Collins, Perpetual Motion, 1997.29Although is beyond the scope of this paper, it is important to note that apart from Bruce,there were two other Scottish Jacobites who were allegedly members of the so-called NeptuneSociety: General Patrick Gordon (1635-1699), who purportedly acted as First Overseer, andHenry Farquharson (c.1675-1739). Both have strong links to Scottish Jacobite Freemasonry. OnGordon, see Collis, ‘Patrick Gordon’. Farquharson was enlisted into Russian service in 1698,whilst the Tsar was in England. As head teacher at the Moscow Mathematical & NavigationSchool he worked extremely closely with Bruce. Farquharson studied under the staunch Jacobite,Professor George Liddel, at Marischal College in Aberdeen. In addition to being a staunchJacobite, Liddel was a Non-Operative Freemason of the Aberdeen Lodge. On Farquharson’scareer in Russia see Fedosov, ‘AScottish Mathematician in Russia’, 102-115.30Ivanov, Ot Petra Pervago do Nashikh Dnei, 82.As regards eternal movement, Peter the Great was fascinated with JohannBessler’s quest to invent a Perpetuum Mobile, embodied in the so-calledWheel of Offyreus, and indeed went to great lengths to purchase this con-traption28. Considering the Tsar’s open-minded scientific curiosity, it isentirely in character that he should have been an enthusiastic patron of eso-teric experimental science at the Russian Court and surrounded himself withstatesmen fascinated in alchemy, natural magic and even astrology.Most legends attest that the first Masonic lodge in Russia went by thename of the “Neptune Society” and initially met at the Sukharev Tower onthe outskirts of Moscow, home to Russia’s first Mathematical and NavigationSchool and first Observatory. Meetings apparently took place in the fencinghall and involved chemical and other experiments, according to some nine-teenth century sources, with Peter the Great as Junior Warden. Two otheralleged members of this Society were Jacob Bruce, a Jacobite sympathizer,and Archbishop Feofan Prokopovich, who fulfilled the role of Orator. Thesetwo figures were undoubtedly among the Tsar’s most intimate and powerfulstatesmen and provide fine examples of the extent to which interest in theoccult actually flourished at the Petrine Court29.1.

As well as this, he was one of the countries chief diplomats, and wasinstrumental in brokering the Nystad peace treaty with Sweden in 1721. Asalready noted, Bruce was the head of the Mathematical and NavigationSchool, based in the Sukharev Tower. Furthermore, it was Bruce who estab-lished Russia’s first observatory there on the third floor in 1699, and indeedhe resided there for a lengthy period before moving to St. Petersburg.The Canadian scholar Valentin Boss has referred to Bruce as Russia’s ‘FirstNewtonian’and credits him with facilitating the adoption of a “modern” char-acter in scientific inquiry31. The popular image of Bruce in Russia, however,has long been associated with sorcery. Pushkin famously wrote that Brucewas the ‘Russian Faust’and many colourful oral legends surrounding himsurvived into the 1920s32. According to these legends, he created a house-maid from flowers, flew over Moscow and resurrected a dead dog—a storyreminiscent of Bulgakov’s classic tale The Heart of a Dog. He was a manwho could predict the weather and people’s fates by observing the stars andconsulted many rare books when concocting powders and remedies33. Manyof these legends relate to Bruce’s nocturnal activities at the Sukharev Towerand a nineteenth century author, Ivan Lazhechnikov, even wrote a novellabased on them, entitled The Sorcerer at the Sukharev Tower(1844).These oral legends stand in stark contrast to the portrait of the rational sci-entist painted by Boss, yet their fantastical quality derives from the fact thatin reality, Bruce, the experimental scientist, did indeed immerse himself inthe esoteric arts. The clearest indication of this are the so-called “BruceCalendars” supervised by Bruce himself. Six of these calendars were printedbetween 1709-1715 and they contain a mixture of astronomical expertisewith a wealth of astrological predictions and religious symbolism.The second sheet of the Bruce Calendars, from 1709, contains consider-able Masonic character and religious mysticism.

In its entirety, Bruce’s alchemical collec-tion alone is enough to discredit the theory that the occult was of no inter-est to members of the Petrine court. This, however, is far from the only sourceindicating such interest among senior statesmen in Peter the Great’s Russia.2. Feofan Prokopovich (1681-1736)Feofan Prokopovich is renowned as being Peter the Great’s chief propagan-dist and principle ecclesiastic ally, referred to by James Cracraft as the ‘firstauthentic voice of the early Enlightenment in Russia’and by Robert Massieas a ‘modern eighteenth century man who happened to be a cleric’45. For thepast century at least, however, scholars have ignored the seemingly lessenlightened sides to his worldview, such as the fact that he held to a literalinterpretation of the Holy Scriptures. Thus, he located the Garden of Edenon the Persian Gulf in Mesopotamia and stated that the Serpent in the Gardenof Eden was genuine46. He cites his authorities on Creation as St. Basil,Ambrosius, Theodoretus, Augustine, Philo and Josephus Flavius, with theonly contemporary figure cited being Johann Zahn (mentioned above), whosework Specula Physico-Mathematico-Historico(1696) follows in the Hermeticand occult tradition of Kircher47. Furthermore, Prokopovich undertook todemonstrate the mathematical possibility of placing all the animals in Noah’sArk and argued against the existence of the Phoenix on the grounds that Goddid not create a partner for it48. He also remarks that it is absurd to state thatthere was no rainbow before the deluge and argues that ‘by bidding to show’such a phenomenon, God gave ‘a sign of his nearness’49. What is more, he believes in the existence of the firmament and stated that heavenly bodieshaveaninfluenceonearthlybodies50.Prokopovich’sexegesisadvocatedthe study of Hebrew and Greek for the correct interpretation of the HolyScriptures and he was fascinated with the question of the Divine Names ofGod—writing a tract on Pseudo-Dionysius’Names of God51.

On angels,Prokopovich writes that one should not doubt their existence, although ‘oneought to note that angels do not have the form of God in such a direct sense,in which there is in people’52. As regards demons, he again states a belief intheir existence and even gives three ways of distinguishing genuine cases:(1) they can explain secrets which a person in a natural condition cannotexplain; (2) they can speak languages which they have never learned; (3)supernatural actions53.In his Natural Philosophy, written in 1708 and used as a principal text-book on the subject when he taught at the Kiev Academy, Prokopovichreveals clear beliefs in occult qualities54. In the section on stones and gems,for example, he provides a list of their various benefits. Thus, an emeraldworn on the finger or hung to its full extent protects against epilepsy, whilsta ruby can oppose poisons and putrefaction, protects from the plague andgladdens the soul55. Prokopovich also writes favourably on alchemy, argu-ing that although alchemists have at present not succeeded in creating artificialgold, it should not be concluded that it is impossible and will not be per-fected in the future56. He reinforces his argument by even referring to thealchemical expertise of angels:Angels by nature have the knowledge to foresee which material and which cor-relations are somehow necessary for the creation of real gold. Consequently,when (alchemists) form everything correctly and mix at the right time, then realgold is created57.Indeed, according to Prokopovich, an alchemist’s search for gold is a pro-ductive quest and has led to people mastering the separation of metals andthe invention of many useful things58. In Prokopovich’s Natural Philosophy,the alchemical works of Daniel Sennert are frequently cited as authoritativetexts on chemical matters. Thus, Prokopovich draws on Sennert when describ-ing the alchemical process of separating mercury from sulphur and salt:Daniel Sennert names it a divine liquid or spirit, of which with great effort it ispossible to separate from fine sulphur and from simple and very rare salt59.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRYAND THE OCCULTATTHE COURTOF PETER THE GREAT1760Chistovich, Feofan Prokopovich i ego Vremia, 648.61See Verkhovskoi, Uchrezhdenie, Nos. 1570, 1708, 925 & 1814 respectively.62See Verkhovskoi, Uchrezhdenie, Nos. 1659, 1144, 1661, 1723, 1808, 2962, 2678respectively.63See, for example, Cracraft (above).64Erskine was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 30th November 1703, along withhis colleague Richard Mead. He was nominated by Sir Hans Sloane.Interestingly, even at his deathbed in 1736, an alchemist was present—knownsimply as Jacob the Alchemist—who subsequently became one of the prin-ciple beneficiaries in his will60.Prokopovich’s library collection reflects his attraction to esotericism. Itcontains a substantial number of alchemical texts, by at least thirty-four dif-ferent authors, including original editions of Petrus Severinus’Idea MedicinaePhilosophicae(1571), Johann Hartmann’s Praxis Chymiatrica(1683), JohanFinck’s Enchiridion Dogmatico-Hermeticum(1618) and Otto Tach’sHippocrates Chymicus61. Prokopovich’s library is especially rich in occultworks. One finds, for example, the collected works of Henricus CorneliusAgrippa, Porta’s Magiae Naturalis, Cardano’s De Rerum Varietate, three edi-tions of Lemnius’Occulta Naturae Miraculaand Marcellus Palingenesis’Zodiacus Vitae, as well as a host of works by other Renaissance and earlymodern writers on natural magic and the occult62.In the past, Prokopovich’s passion for learning and scientific experimen-tation has been viewed solely from a post-Enlightenment perspective, inwhich his reading of Baconian and Cartesian theories has been stressed63.Whilst it is true that works by both Bacon and Descartes are present in hislibrary, one has to substantially broaden his breadth of learning in order tofully appreciate the intellectual worldview of this fascinating and hugelyinfluential figure. I would argue, therefore, that it would be far more accu-rate to compare Prokopovich’s Natural Philosophy—his principle statementof scientific views—to the spirit of scientific inquiry advocated by AthanasiusKircher, a towering late Renaissance figure, which rests on a profoundly reli-gious worldview saturated with occult beliefs.3. Robert Erskine (1677-1718)Athird figure worthy of mention, in light of links to Freemasonry and theoccult, is Robert Erskine FRS, a Scottish physician and Jacobite, who arrivedin Russia in 170464.

Erskine fulfilledthe role of the Tsar’s Chief Physician, was head of the Russian medical estab-lishment and was given the prestigious honour of being the first Director ofthe St. Petersburg Kunstkamera and its Head Librarian in 1714.Astonishingly, it seems Erskine amassed one of the largest private alchem-ical collections in Europe for the age—a secret that has remained deeplyburied inside the archives of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences Libraryup to this day. It is double the size of Bruce’s own noteworthy collection,and contains at least 287 separate works by 157 different authors65. This quan-tity well exceeds the noted collection of Isaac Newton and is actually some-what larger than the renowned collection of Hans Sloane. Two of the most remarkable inclusions in a remarkable collection are an original firstedition of The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutzand a rare 1615 Strasbourg edition of both Rosicrucian Manifestos, accompanied withAdam Haselmayer’s Replyand three others affirming the credibility of theBrotherhood66. Erskine’s alchemical interests were no doubt cemented bytraining at the University of Utrecht under the noted alchemist and ChemistryProfessor, Johann Conrad Barchusen (1666-1723). In a similar fashion asboth Prokopovich and Bruce, Erskine also amassed an extraordinarily richstock of other volumes on the occult. Asmall sample being a 1552 editionof Iamblichus’s De Mysteriis Aegyptorum Chaldaeorum, a work on astralmedicine purportedly by Hermes Trismegistus, Caspar Longinus’TrinumMagicum, containing a rich collection of ancient sources of magic, Kircher’saccounts of Egyptian magic, a work by Johannes Staricius on the magicalpower of Egyptian shields, Gutsavus Selenus’encyclopaedic work on cryp-tography, entitled Cryptomenytices Crytographia(1624) and Gabriel Naude’sdefence of natural magicians67.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRYAND THE OCCULTATTHE COURTOF PETER THE GREAT1968Statutes, xv-xvi; Baigent, The Temple & the Lodge, 228-334, 376-77.69Cf. Paul, Miscellany, 408-10.Erskine’s links to Jacobite Freemasonry are strong. He was a cousin ofthe Earl of Mar, who led the Jacobite Rebellion in 1715 and who was alsoallegedly the Grand Master of the Order of the Temple68. Erskine’s Grand-father was the 2nd, or 7th Earl of Mar, the favourite childhood companionof King James I and he was also related to Chevalier Andrew Ramsay, thenoted champion of mystical Eccossais Freemasonry in the 1730s, whosepatron was the Earl of Mar. Robert Erskine maintained contact with the Earlof Mar and his own brother, Sir John Erskine, whilst in Russia and formedpart of a Jacobite network that spanned the continent. From a letter addressedto the Earl of Mar and written by George Mackenzie, the official BritishResident in St. Petersburg and agent to Mar, it seems clear that some formof Jacobite Masonic network existed in St. Petersburg—with Robert Erskineat its centre—from at least as early as 1714. This letter is worth quoting infull:St. Petersburg, ye 29th of October o.s 1714My Lord,—To the very best of Guarantys there is stil allow’d time accordingto the circumstances, or nature of the principals, for whose sake these are enter’dinto; tis true I had the honour to write yor Lordp.

Interestingly, the Tsar also awarded himself the rankof Captain of the Preobrazhenski Regiment.71Pisma i Bumagi, Vol. XI, 122.72In 1711, for example, Naryshkin was sent on a lengthy diplomatic mission to Florence andthe Court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo de Medici III. Furthermore, in 1712, he wassent on a mission to Denmark and in 1713 he embarked on a mission to Vienna. It should alsobe mentioned that Naryshkin later became Russian Ambassador to Britain, between the yearsof 1740-1747.73See Gordin, ‘Delo Tsarevicha Alekseia’,134; Pisma i Bumagi, Vol I, 78.Naroskin was a Chamberlain and a relative of the Tsar and it seems he isalso acting as some kind of courier or messenger between various royalhouses. The indication that a Naryshkin was linked to Freemasonry is highlysignificant, as Peter the Great held an extremely tight bond with the mem-bers of his mother’s (Natalia Naryshkina) family. It is my believe that theNaryshkin in question here is Semen Grigorovich Naryshkin (c. 1680-1747),an extremely close aide to the Tsar up until 1718, when he was implicatedin the affair surrounding the Tsarevich Alexei and was forced into exile inFrance.Semen Grigorovich Naryshkin was indeed a Chamberlain (KomnatniiStolnik) to the Tsar, as well as serving as a General Adjutant. In 1708, hewas also awarded the rank of Captain in the Lifeguards of the prestigiousPreobrazhenski Regiment70. Furthermore, Naryshkin was also frequentlyutilised as a personal courier and diplomatic messenger by the Tsar, as wellas being entrusted with missions to hire craftsmen and purchase artefacts inItaly and Germany71. No doubt the Tsar drew on the Western European edu-cation and widespread connections of his younger kinsman72. Naryshkin had,after all, been enlisted as one of only thirty-five so-called “Volunteers” (whichincluded the Tsar himself in its ranks) who accompanied the Russian GrandEmbassy to Western Europe in 1697. The young Naryshkin remained inWestern Europe for two years, prior to moving on to Berlin in 1699, wherehe received an education in military engineering and languages.The intimacy of the relationship between Naryshkin and the Tsar is indi-cated by their correspondence, in which the former refers to Peter as “Uncle”and signs his letters with the affectionate diminutive “Senka”73. As one ofthe few young “Volunteers” to receive a Western education, Naryshkin wasa shining example of the new breed of boyars, or Russian aristocrats, muchvaunted by the Tsar. As a descendant of the Naryshkin clan, Semen wouldhave also encapsulated, in Peter’s eyes, the noble and progressive stock ofhis own bloodline.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FREEMASONRYAND THE OCCULTATTHE COURTOF PETER THE GREAT2174See Serkov, Russkoe Masonstvo, 2003.75Smith, Working the Rough Stone, 19.

Arndt’s textwas subsequently banned in 1742, during the reign of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna.The connection between the Naryshkin clan and Freemasonry in post-Petrine Russia is extremely strong, with eight members of the family docu-mented to have been Freemasons during the eighteenth-century alone74. Oneof these seven, Semen Kirillovich Naryshkin (1710-1775), is officiallyrecorded as Russia’s first Freemason, having been initiated into a lodge inParis in 173775.In the person of Semen Grigorovich Naryshkin, however, it is hard to thinkof an individual more suited to the aristocratic and learned ideals of JacobiteFreeemasonry and with such amble opportunity to familiarise himself withits milieu in Western Europe. Thus, the tantalising proof that Naryshkin wasa “Brother Mechanick” of the Masonic Order as early as at least 1714, withclose links to Jacobitism through Robert Erskine and the Earl of Mar, opensup the real need to re-examine the presently accepted view, which marks1731 as the year in which a Hanoverian form of Freemasonry penetrated intoRussia. Furthermore, whilst little is known of the scientific or theologicalbeliefs of Naryshkin, the clear occult interests of Erskine, Bruce andProkopovich provide a fascinating insight into what still remains somethingof a hidden and taboo area in the history of Petrine Russia.Prior to concluding, it is also worthy of note that Bruce, Prokopovich andErskine all embraced a tolerant form of Christianity, in line with the ethosof Freemasonry, which was imbued with mystical and eschatological ele-ments. Bruce was strongly attracted to German Pietism and his house was acentre for Pietists from Halle who began their activities in Russia from hisresidence76. His Pietist inclinations are clearly revealed in his library collec-tion, which contains many Pietist works, including a significant collectionby Phillip Jacob Spener77.Prokopovich was also strongly attracted to Halle Pietism—correspondingwith August Francke and sending seminary students to study at Halle. Indeed,Francke sent Prokopovich an edition of Johann Arndt’s True Christianity,which he subsequently ordered to be translated into Russian78.

Prokopovich’sattraction to reformed Protestantism merged with a deep devotion to certainmystical Christian Neoplatonist Church Fathers, such as Pseudo-Dionysiusand Maximus the Confessor, who he frequently cites as authorities on scrip-tural matters. Erskine too had a sizeable theological collection, which reflectshis upbringing as a Scottish Episcopalian. Many Jacobite EpiscopalianPhysicians from the North East of Scotland, as Erskine was, were renownedfor their mystical tendencies at the beginning of the eighteenth century andit is significant that Erskine’s religious texts indicate he also shared this out-look. One finds, for example, works by the Scottish mystics George Gardenand Henry Scougall, as well as other texts by Thomas a Kempis, JohannArndt, Gottfried Arnold, William Penn and John Norris80. Erskine also owneda whole raft of eschatological texts by such noted figures as John Napier,Alsted, Joseph Mede and a remarkable eleven works by Pierre Jurieu81.ConclusionThe triumvirate of Bruce, Prokopovich and Erskine were three of the Tsar’smost valued statesmen and helped to enact the Petrine Reforms.

There also exists ample evidence that Peter the Great himselfshared a very similar outlook to these figures. These revelations do not neces-sitate a rejection of the long-standing assumption that the Russian Tsar lookedto the West for his vision of a modern Russia. It merely requires the reali-sation that Western Europe itself had not undergone a radical paradigm shifttowards the rational and secular, in the Kuhnian sense, at the start of theeighteenth century.Indeed, I would argue that it is possible (and constructive) to radically re-evaluate the entire Petrine reform project in light of the ideals of Christianreformists of the seventeenth century, such as Francis Bacon, Johann ValentinAndreae and Jan Amos Comenius, in which science and religion fused to create an eschatological, yet progressive vision.

Les réformes de cette période ont souvent été envisagées en tantque transformation ascendante d’une société désuète ou comme l’abrogation pernicieuse de laculture russe traditionnelle. Cette dichotomie réside dans une idée convenue du rationnel et duséculier de Pierre le Grand et de son règne.Cette communication tente de réévaluer la dichotomie par l’étude de l’influence occulte etmaçonnique qui prévalait à la cour de Pierre le Grand. Ces deux aspects complémentaires dela société et la culture pétrine ont été censurés ou mis à l’écart par des générations successivesd’historiens, pourtant ceux-ci ont exercé une influence considérable sur certains des hommesd’état les plus puissants de l’époque, y compris le Tsar lui-même. L’examen de l’influencemaçonnique et occulte de la Russie pétrine peut aider à surpasser l’image séculière forte dePierre le Grand, sans remettre en cause la nature progressiste de ses réformes.La première partie de l’article envisage les représentations symboliques solides du Tsar entant que “Roi Maçon” et architecte d’une nouvelle Russie. Celle-ci dévoile une campagne convergente pour décrire Pierre le Grand comme le nouveau Roi David, conduisant son peuple(les nouveaux Israélites) vers les terres promises et la Nouvelle Jérusalem, concrétisée par lafondation de St. Pétersbourg. Nous examinerons ensuite comment la vision du monde de Pierre le grand (sa tolérance religieuse, sa curiosité scientifique tournée vers l’ésotérisme et sapassion pour les sociétés chevaleresques) était entièrement compatible avec les idéaux de laFranc-Maçonnerie, telle qu’elle se développait au XVIIIIèmesiècle.Dans la deuxième partie de l’article, nous nous concentrerons sur les liens maçonniques etles forts intérêts occultes de Jacob Bruce (1669-1735), Feofan Prokopovich (1681-1736) etRobert Erskine (1677-1718)—trois des plus grands hommes d’état de la Russie pétrine. Bruce,issu d’une famille jacobite écossaise, jouait un rôle actif dans presque tous les ressorts de la vied’état russe, de l’armée à la promotion des sciences et de l’éducation. Prokopovich était la figureecclésiastique la plus éminente de la Russie pétrine et un fidèle partisan des réformes de l’Etatde Pierre le Grand. Erskine, comme Bruce, descendait d’une famille Jacobite puissante d’Ecosse;il appréciait être proche de Pierre le Grand. Il était son Médecin en Chef, Directeur de la Chancellerie Médicale Russe et Directeur de la Kunstkamera de St. Pétersbourg et de la bibliothèque.Ce triumvirat a joué un rôle actif dans la transformation de l’état Russe, toutefois, ils ne sym-bolisent pas des incarnations archétypes des lumières purement rationnelles et séculières. Ilsaffichaient tous un grand sentiment religieux et un intérêt marqué pour l’ésotérisme. Bruce etErskine, en particulier, avaient de fortes attaches avec la Franc-Maçonnerie Jacobite. Pierre leGrand exhibait des intérêts similaires et était leur fervent bienfaiteur. Ainsi, nous espérons quenotre article mettra en avant la prédominance nette des idéaux Maçonniques et d’une fascina-tion pour l’occulte dans la Cour pétrine et permettra de façonner les transformations édictéesdurant cette période pivot de l’histoire russe.AbstractThe reign of Peter the Great is regarded as one of the most significant and contentious epochsin Russian history. It has been customary to view the reforms of the period as either a pro-gressive transformation of an antiquated society or the destructive suppression of traditionalRussian culture. This dichotomy rests on an accepted perception of Peter the Great and his reignas rational and secular.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26ROBERTCOLLISThis paper attempts to revise this dichotomy by focussing on the Masonic and occult influenceprevalent at the Petrine Court. These two complimentary aspects of Petrine society and culturehave been censured or overlooked by successive generations of historians, yet they exerted aconsiderable hold on some of the most powerful statesmen of the period, including the Tsarhimself. The importance of studying Masonic and occult influence in Petrine Russia lies in thefact that it can help to overcome the starkly secular image of Peter the Great, without denyingthe progressive nature of his reforms.The first section of the article examines the powerful symbolic representations of the Tsar asa “Mason King” and architect of a new Russia. It reveals a concerted campaign to portray Peterthe Great as a new King David, leading his people—new Israelites—to their promised land anda New Jerusalem, crystallised by the foundation of St. Petersburg. This is then followed byexamining how Peter the Great’s worldview—encompassing religious tolerance, a scientificcuriosity open to esotericism and a passion for chivalrous societies—was wholly compatiblewith the ideals of Freemasonry as it developed at the beginning of the eighteenth-century.The second part of the paper focuses on the Masonic links and strong occult interests of JacobBruce (1669-1735), Feofan Prokopovich (1681-1736) and Robert Erskine (1677-1718)—threeof the most prominent statesmen in Petrine Russia. Bruce came from a Scottish Jacobite fam-ily and played an active role in practically all fields of Russian state life, ranging from the mil-itary to the promotion of science and education. Prokopovich was the most eminent ecclesiasticfigure in Petrine Russia and a loyal stalwart of Peter the Great’s state reforms. Erskine, likeBruce, also descended from a powerful Jacobite family in Scotland. He enjoyed a close rela-tionship with Peter the Great and was his Chief Physician and Head of the Russian MedicalChancellery, as well as being Director of the St. Petersburg Kunstkamera and Library.This triumvirate played an active role in transforming the Russian State, but do not representthe archetypal embodiments of purely rational and secular enlighteners. They all displayed astrong religiosity and a marked interest in esoteric matters and Bruce and Erskine, in particu-lar, had strong ties to Jacobite Freemasonry. Peter the Great displayed similar interests and actedas their enthusiastic patron. Thus, it is hoped that this paper will reveal the significant extent towhich Masonic ideals and a fascination with the occult were rife at the Petrine Court and helpedto shape the transformations enacted during this pivotal period in Russian history.ARIES 6,1_f3_1-26 12/8/05 6:02 PM Page 26"}]
