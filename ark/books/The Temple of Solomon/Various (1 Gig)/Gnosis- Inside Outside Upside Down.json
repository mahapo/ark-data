This is due to several reasons. Thefirst is the evolution of our understanding regarding howmagick works; the second is based on the term itself, it’shistory and baggage; and the final factor rests on variousmisunderstandings of the term, and the mental state which itsuggests. While a definitive and final answer is beyond thescope of this article we can at the very least provide aseries of working definitions. These definitions are by nomeans the “last word” on the topic. They are intended as aframework within which the magician can better understand hermental states and their relationship to the magick that she isdoing.I will begin with a little history and background on the termGnosis(which many are already familiar with). Next I will moveonto Peter Carroll’s own definition and the various methods heindicated for reaching Gnosis. Then I will discuss theconfusion surrounding the concept of Gnosis and the reasonsfor it. After that I will touch on the states of consciousnessthat often occur along the way to Gnosis, that may be usefulmagically but are not a state of Gnosis in and of themselves.Finally I will conclude with something which suspiciouslyresembles the introduction.History:(This part includes many factoids designed to wow co-workers, family, friends and other cocktail party attendees with yourerudite knowledge on really old stuff).The ancient Greeks, like us, had many ways of saying they knewabout something. For example we might have faith that something is true, or be acquainted with a bit of knowledge or have acquired wisdom after having spent many years doing something. Our Mediterranean predecessors made many of thesame distinctions. To believe in something without direct"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/gnosis.html2 of 81/22/2007 6:37 PMknowledge of it was pistis, which was their word for faith and it meant pretty much the same thing to them as it does to us.The knowledge acquired by having lots of experience wassophia, the modern version of which is wisdom. Again, we can almost draw a one-to-one relationship between the ancientGreek term and our own word. Our own verb toknow in fact comes from Greek and their word for it was gnosis. However for them gnosis didn’t simply mean to be acquainted with something or be familiar with it or have faith in it or to have experiencewith it, to the Greeks it meant a direct connection betweenyou and the thing itself.Now had the Greeks simply been left to their own devices thisdivision of the various forms of knowing might have remainedthe providence of their own quirky language. However, threefactors prevented this from occurring. The first was that theGreeks didn’t have a lot of land but what they did have wereboats, and they went out in those boats and set up shop in allthe best ports around the Mediterranean Sea. This pretty muchput them in contact with the whole crowd of who’s who in theancient world. The second (in about 350 BCE) was Alexander theGreat.Alexander the Great was the forerunner of many short, overlyambitious men to come. Even though he was from a backwaterplace north of Greece called Macedonia, he thought that Greekculture was just the bee’s knees, and that everyone shouldagree with him. Considering he was at the head of the mostformidable army at the time, his power to convince people hewas right was sufficiently enhanced. Alexander overran all thebest kingdoms and empires he could find, and in the processtook over a sizable portion of Africa and Asia. (He would havegone even further but most of his troops complained that theyhad marched so far they no longer knew where they livedanymore, so Alex settled down in Babylon). Though dying young,and inconvienently allowing his empire to fall apart he didsucceed in setting the stage for the final factor, the Romans.The Romans came storming out of Italy about 200 years afterAlexander had had his day in the sun. The Romans sharedAlexander’s appreciation for all things Greek. However, unlikeAlexander and his magnificent Macedonians, the Romansconsidered being Roman just about the best thing anyone couldbe. They thought it was such a good idea to be Roman that theyset out to convince just about everyone around that theyshould be Roman too. In the process of this they took over notonly most of Western Europe but North Africa as well and agood slice of Asia, if you please.The Romans liked roads and trade, so they encouraged a lot ofit. A side effect of all the goods and services moving to andfro around the Mediterranean was, that along with all thebaggage, grain and slaves also came a lot of ideas. Theseideas covered everything from philosophy and mathematics toreligion and mysticism. In the parts of the Roman Empire thathad once been Alexander’s stomping ground just about everyone"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/gnosis.html3 of 81/22/2007 6:37 PMspoke Greek. So, when there was the opportunity to expressone’s ideas one usually did it in Greek.Another side effect of the Romans conquering everyone living within a couple of 1000 miles of them was that the areaenjoyed long periods of relative peace and stability. Peoplehad time to worry about other things apart from farming, tradeand whether or not they were about to be invaded, raped andpillaged. This created an atmosphere in which mystical,religious and philosophical schools could thrive, and a classof people who could indulge in them (remember all that trade -it created a whole class of individuals with money and time ontheir hands).And we finally get to Gnosis:The mystical schools and cults generally concerned themselves with otherworldly things, and connecting humanity to them. Theinitiated in these cults had vastly different approaches tothis, ranging from abstaining from worldly things as much aspossible to indulging in them as much as possible in order totranscend them. The connection to the spiritual realm wassought through direct experience of it, while still in thisworld. This direct connection, or direct knowledge of it wascalled gnosis. Note: this was often referred to as a directknowledge or experience of god.Modern day Christianity itself arose in this soup and had aprofound impact on many of these mystery cults. The role of adivine savior was a center piece to many of them though Jesuswas only one of several choices; there were also characterslike Seth and Adam. Since the one thing these groups shared incommon was an attempt to dial in and connect to the big G theywere collectively called “Gnostics” though they really were insome cases vastly different, competing schools of mysticalthought.As Christianity ramped up, its advocates set out on adetermined campaign to eliminate the competition. All theGnostic mystery schools were collectively lumped into thecategory of being heretical, and a lot of nasty things weresaid about them. When the Roman authorities themselvesconverted to Christianity, the Gnostics were pretty muchdoomed. So effective was the campaign against them, that if wedidn’t have the records recovered and translated from the NagHammadi library, we would only have the writings of variousChristians regarding the Gnostics to go by (and since theChurch was in competition against the Gnostics it’s hardly animpartial view to go by).What did survive was the term gnosis and the various ideasassociated with it, primary the direct knowledge of thespiritual. While various “Gnostic” heresies would come and goin the centuries between then and now the idea was defined bythe first Gnostics way back when in ancient Rome."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/gnosis.html4 of 81/22/2007 6:37 PMPeter “double R - double L” Carroll:From about the mid to late 1800’s through to today there hasbeen a consistent and permissible interest in magick. NowMagick has been defined in a number of different ways but thebest way to put it might be the following: Magick is an act ofwill which produces a result through the use of a non-localmedium.1While the middle ages did have its magicians, these wereusually one of two classes of individuals. Some were verywealthy, very bored aristocrats who were above the law (asthey were the law) and so didn’t have to worry about overlyeager churchmen with spare matches. The others werecharlatans, who existed outside of the law (often relying onthe protection of patrons or a high rate of mobility to avoidsaid pyrophillic clergy). However it was in the 20th centurythat occultism as we know it really got going. One of the lastthings on the scene was something called “chaos magic” and thefirst author to reach a wide audience on the topic was PeterCarroll.Peter Carroll took ideas from Crowley, A. O. Spare and othersand put it all together into a relatively simple andstraightforward system for doing magick to produce results. Heeventually came to call his concoction “Chaos Magick Theory”and it is explained elsewhere on this website in a veryinteresting and informative article. One of the central ideasin chaos magic is the concept that in order to have an impacton either yourself or the universe the magician had to enterinto an extreme altered state of consciousness. This state ofconsciousness was so extreme that all other external andinternal stimuli and information was blocked out. The universefor the magician narrowed to a single point (one could evensay it narrowed to a singularity of consciousness). Carrollchose to call this single-pointed consciousness or “no-mind”state, Gnosis. Peter Carroll classified all the ways to reachGnosis under two categories: Inhibitory and Excitatory. In theInhibitory category, the body/mind is progressively stilleduntil all your conscious awareness is restricted to asingularity of consciousness, while in Excitatory category thebody/mind is taxed through overuse until it collapses intothat same state.Gnosis, in either case, is not the process itself, but the end result. A state in which consciousness collapses into a singlepoint. Until you cross that threshold you are not in a stateof Gnosis. To get across that threshold you can use your body,your emotions or chemicals (or any combination of these).Carroll listed a short list of activities and stimuli, which could be useful in breaking through the normal levels ofconsciousness and reaching Gnosis. Here is a similar samplelist with each activity along with a brief explanation."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/gnosis.html5 of 81/22/2007 6:37 PMPhysical Activities:Chanting – A rhythmic repetition of sounds, syllables orwords.Drumming – Open handed pounding on a percussion instrument.Dancing – Repetitive series of body movements.Hyperventilation – Rapidly forced inhalation and exhalation ofair.Glossalalia – Quickly stringing together letters and syllablesin a nonsensical fashion.Gazing – Keeping your gaze focused on one point for anextended period of time.Visualization – Holding the same image fixed in your mind’seye.Sensory Deprivation – Removing as much external stimuli aspossible.Sensory Overload – Bombarding your eyes, ears, nose and/ortouch with stimuli.Pain – Ouch.Emotional States:Rage – Have you ever “seen red” - that’s pretty much what itmeans.Fear – The expression “paralyzed with fear” sums it up.Laughter – Sometimes loosing bladder control isn’t all bad.Chemical Aids: The consumption or use of just about any substance legal orillicit in sufficient quantities can produce extreme alteredstates of consciousness. However, these are often ill focusedand hard to manage. So called hard drugs (LSD, THC, Opium,Cocaine, etc) often enhance a mental state or feeling, but doso in such a way which doesn’t readily bring the entirety ofone’s consciousness to a single purpose (unless that purposeis unconsciousness). However, if one can focus on a desiredgoal it is possible to cross into a state of Gnosis - shamansof primitive cultures have been doing so for ages.And now that Part about Confusion:The use of any of the above, in and of itself, does notconstitute achieving Gnosis. It’s quite possible to chant,drum, dance, be angry or be afraid, be stoned, high, or"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/gnosis.html6 of 81/22/2007 6:37 PMtripping, and not be in a state of Gnosis. Nor is doing any ofthe above activities in the context of a ritual automaticallymake it Gnosis either. This is where many experienced andsemi-experienced magicians get confused. They engage in apractice and mistake the practice for the goal, the drive forthe destination (and other assorted cheesy metaphors) leavesthem with a partial understanding regarding Gnosis.Additionally, a pure state of Gnosis is not always required toachieve one’s ritual objective. Why? There are a number ofreasons: First reason being that some events are just going tohappen by chance anyway. It didn’t matter squat whether or notyou did magick for it. The second reason is that wemanufacture a good deal of our reality through the creativeinterpretation of the informational soup that we swim throughevery day. In short, once we determine that something willhappen, it does. It does so because we are paying attentionfor it. We look out for it and thus it appears. The thirdreason is that quite a number of magical objectives are aboutyou manufacturing a change in yourself, doing the ritual atall was a sign to your subconscious to bring such-and-such achange about.The fourth reason is, that even if the event was not going to happen by chance or have something to do with your perspectiveor involve an internal change, you are directing some energyat the probability matrix around the event you desire. If thecircumstances only required a bit of a nudge then you maysucceed without the consciousness singularity which is Gnosis.Add to all of that a lack of rigor in terms of judging theprobability of one’s objectives, and a general unwillingnesstowards any kind of self-directed critical thinking regardingone’s own methodologies, and we have the perfect stew for nothaving a clue about Gnosis. This doesn’t mean that most peoplelack the intellectual capacity to understand what Gnosis is,they do have that capacity. But Gnosis isn’t something youlearn about through study, it’s knowledge gained throughdirect experience. If you have not had the experience you mayknow about Gnosis, but you do not know Gnosis.The Cul de Sacs on the way to Gnosis:Human consciousness is a flexible thing. It has evolved to be that way over time. The more flexible you can be - the morelikely you are to survive adverse conditions. One element offlexibility is the ability to maintain a general sense ofawareness even when preoccupied. Awareness is crucial tosurvival and since Gnosis short circuits awareness (and thuson a purely physiological or instinctual level puts themagician at risk from outside dangers) the mind will avoid it,or more correctly work around it, until the magician appliesenough determination to reach it. These states are not the work of some subconscious saboteur but are, instead, atestament to the depth and flexibility of the human system."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/gnosis.html7 of 81/22/2007 6:37 PMLight Trance State: This is where the consciousness forms whatis called a “cognitive loop” - a single repetitive actioncontinues while the mind forms a secondary stream ofconsciousness. This is why you can drive a manual transmissioncar and carry on a conversation at the same time; or why youcan be really angry but still remember to pick up a loaf ofbreak from the store. Your mind can multitask. If we rated theprocess of achieving gnosis on a scale from “0” = No Gnosisand “1” = Gnosis, then a Light Trance would be somewhere about0.3 and magical operations succeeding would depend more on theprobability of them happening through chance or design thanfrom the force obtained from this operation.Medium Trance State: If you keep up the activity the secondarystream of consciousness may itself form a cognitive loop. Thisis called a Medium Trance State, to use the driving analogyonce more, long haul drivers are very familiar with the caseof being “hypnotized by the road” where it appears that thecar is stationary and earth is moving underneath you. To usethe same emotional analogy – it’s possible to get so mad thatyou can still drive home, but you will forget to stop at thestore.2Our minds can easily break out of this state or form atertiary stream of consciousness but it’s safe to say thatonce we’ve looped two streams of consciousness, we’re in aMedium Trance State: On the Gnosis Scale this would be about0.67 The chance for this amount of energy forcing a magicalresult is about 50/50.Deep Trance State: If the primary, secondary and tertiaryconsciousness streams are all forced into cognitive loops wehave a deep trance state. This state is extremely close toGnosis but isn’t quite there. It has many of the hallmarks ofGnosis (time distortions, memory blackouts, loss ofequilibrium), but there are still thoughts and sensationswhich are secondary to the activity designed to produce thestate of Gnosis. If this state were on a Gnosis Scale it wouldbe about 0.95 – 0.98; one should note that reaching this stateis sufficient for most magical operations to be effective. Infact, most magicians can go through their entire magicalcareers getting no farther than this state and still beobtaining really good results.Conclusion: (Déjà vu all over again.)Hopefully this article has provided you with a better understanding of Gnosis. While there are differing opinions onwhat Gnosis is or is not - the magician should only beconcerned with using which definition works best for her.Gnosis, whether the direct knowledge of the supernatural or asingularity of consciousness remains an integral part of themodern occult lexicon.

Ratatosk can be reached at geistlos@wi.rr.com1 Crowley’s definition of magick: “Magick is the Science and Art of causingchange to occur in conformity with Will” fails the primary test of adefinition as it does not also define what it not. For example if I make abaloney sandwich I have changed something in accordance with my will butit’s not an act of magick. However if I had employed a non-local medium tomake the sandwich that would be magick, i.e. summoned a servitor who madethe sandwich or cast a sigil which resulted in a sandwich being deliveredto me.2 Don’t drive angry."}]
