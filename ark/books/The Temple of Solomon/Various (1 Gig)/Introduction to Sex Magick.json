[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Introduction to sex magic \"Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.\" Oscar Wilde Sex magick means using your sexuality in order to work magick. This technique is not new nor outrageaous; although usually kept secret many esoteric systems use sexuality for spiritual and magical aims. Examples of such traditions are witchcraft, shamanism, alchemy, Buddhism and Hinduism tantra and ancient Egyptian religion. A probably more known form of sex magick is the ceremonial sexual union of man and woman on the land to ensure a good crop. Their fertility act should encourage the land to deliver a rich harvest. Western sex magick has its roots in Hebrew kabala and is spread further through several occult doctrines like the knights templar and the free masons. Nowadays sex magick is a beautiful way of giving sex back its rightful place of sacred sexuality. It is a firm invitation to leave the trail of the sneaky, hidden-in-the-dark and 'sinful' sex most of us have grown up with. It is a call to stop fighting this most powerful human force and to make use of its possibilities. Since sexuality is a gift from God/the Goddess it has to be divine. Within an open and respectful sexual relationship we can experience ourselves in all our aspects: the animal part, the human part and the divine flame within. Thus the beast-man-God is connected, as well as the beast-woman-Goddess. During sexual arousal an enormous amount of energy can be channeled upwards from the genitals along the spine to the top of the head. On its way up this energy fills and cleans blockages in the chakras, caused by emotional and psychological wounds. This explains why several spiritual paths view sexual yoga as a shortcut to enlightenment. \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Kiss of the whole World, wall painting by Gustav Klimt Why use sex for magical aims? Simply because the creative force itself creates very powerful magick. Secondly because it is the most pleasureable magick one can do. The strong sexual force is the 'raw oil of our body' as Lama Yeshe stated. Several practitioners of sex magick reported that this form of magick turned out to be much stronger then the ceremonial magick they had practiced before. Sex magick does not require previous knowledge of ceremonial magick. Anyone who is dedicated to controlling and directing his or her sexual energies for magickal work, and who has a reasonable physical condition, is able to perform sex magick. However, if you don't feel attracted to sex magick simply don't do it! And never let someone force you into sex magick against your will. Practicing sex magick neither implies that you have to give up sex for pleasure. It is up to you to decide how much sex you wish to use for magical rituals and how much for purely having a good time with yourself or your partner. What is the theory behind sex magick?

In sex magick we basically focus on a goal by affirmation, visualization etc.; we raise much energy through prolonged sexual arousal and we release the energy at the moment of orgasm. The goal in sex magick can be the achievement or attraction of anything wished in the physical world, like a new house, a better relationship or a healing. It can also be the charging of magickal tools or talismans. And the goal can be spiritual development. This controlled form of love-making for higher purposes is often mentioned as the ultimate explanation of Crowley’s famous statement \"Love is the Law, Love under Will.\" By love Crowley meant the uniting of the opposites masculine and feminine, active and receptive, and not so much romantic love. Orgasm is considered to be the moment when 'the gates of heaven open up'; for a while the barriers between the restricted physical world and the limitless heavens dissolve. During the precious orgasmic moments we swing away our magical desire into the universe with enormous power and a 'magickal child' is born. This magickal child is the astral effect of our magical action that will result in manifestation. The sexual fluids of man and woman are charged with powerful qualities because of their magick and they can be used for several purposes.

I have never heard of anyone who liked condoms, but they do have their effect on preventing sexual transferable diseases. So in case you do magick with a partner you're not sure of his/her physical sexual health, or in case you have several partners or alternating partners - do yourself a favor and use a rubber (with flavor). Please also be very careful with oral sex in case you or your partner has a bleeding wound or an ulcer in the mouth or on the genital area, or in case of an unusual looking or smelling sexual fluid. Take care of your body and see a doctor. Several sex magick authors emphasize the importance of the mingling of male and female sexual fluids; in case you have a partner who carries no sexual transferable disease it is great to (also) physically mingle sexual fluids; but in case you're not sure please know that magick goes beyond matter, what means that on astral level sexual fluids are mingled anyway, condom or not.

Human bodies are beautifully shaped and wondrously working temples of the soul; in sex magick the body literally is the temple in which the divine is worshipped, and the genital area is the altar.

Why are male strippers sexy while wearing a string and don't the women want them completely naked? Has God forgotten something or is there something strange going on in society? The idea of genitals being a less accepted body part has everything to do with the belief system of Christian and Islamic based societies having difficulties with accepting sexuality. In this age you're allowed to think for yourself. Look into the deepest you and ask yourself what you really find of the vulva of a woman when she in excitement opens up for you like a flower, swelling and more coloring, spreading a musky odor and an inviting moisture? And let your heart speak if a man's testicles are swelling, his penis is hard and big and his breath is deepening. He is proud of it himself, and why shouldn't you be? Nature/the Goddess has granted us the gift of being Gods ourselves; through these 'ugly' genitals we can create a 'beautiful' baby - isn't this way of thinking completely insane? To me the Indian approach with openly yoni (the vagina) and vajra or lingam (the penis) worship is much healthier. Western society brings female attraction in connection with big breasts and the value of a man with the length of his penis - let's pray to God that extra-terrestrials never find out this ridicule. Another commonly spread idea is that our buttocks should better not be exposed. The truth is however that both men and women get attracted and excited about the butts of their partners, whether they are ideally shaped according to certain standards or not. Numerous periodicals show models size 34 to 36 with a body-fat percentage of 10, while average women have 22 - 26 percent body-fat. Mother Nature does not agree with the 'ideal' image of nowadays - beneath a certain amount of body-fat women simply won't get pregnant. Many low-weighted ballet dancers and sufferers of anorexia / bulimia don't menstruate! In earlier days the idea of beauty was much heavier - if you look at the beautiful Greek goddesses or the women depicted on 17th till 19th century paintings we would nowadays consider them to be rubies. The moral behind this story is that the idea of what is beautiful or not depends very much on the standards of a certain time. So please throw all this social nonsense overboard. Accept your body as a miraculous instrument that does anything you want it to do; secondly accept its unique shapes, unless your overweight is negatively influencing your wellbeing.. In that case go to a gym or sports school and adapt healthy eating habits. Working out regularly not only improves your physical health and appearance, but it also increases your sex-drive and heightens your self-esteem.

In the book 'Conversations with God' Neale Walsch asks how we could best express sexual energy. And Gods answer is: \"Lovingly. Openly. Playfully. Joyfully. Outrageous. Passionately. Sacred. Creative. Shameless. Sensual. And of course regularly.\" About masturbation God states \"give yourself enough pleasure and you will dispose of enough pleasure to give away to others\". For those who wonder whether sex should be openly discussed and celebrated I hope this is an answer. Sex can be a fantastic way of deep communication between two people and with the inner you. Positive sexual experiences are very healing on psychological and physical level (yes, physical ailments and diseases have been cured by having sex) and they repair lesions in the auric shield. Accepting and enjoying the pure you provide a strong connection with the forces of ever-creative Great Mother Nature, and it reminds us of being gods ourselves. In this way oral sex becomes an intimate way of worshipping the god or goddess in your partner through adoring the genitals, being the physical representation of the male or female deity. In oral sex the active partner connects the spiritual chakras in the head with the sexual and creative chakra of the receptive partner, another connection between spirituality and sexuality. Sex makes room to experience both our male and female side, and to alternatively be active and passive, electric and magnetic; thus it enhances inner balance and we cherish the inner lover. Sexuality and spirituality are two sides of the same coin; they both aim at feeling fantastic, being in the present moment (the never-ending now), dissolving barriers with other realms, connecting with the divine, experiencing oneness, timelessness, void and ecstasy. Only their starting point differs: sex starts in the lowest chakras while spirituality is seated in the higher chakras.

Any type of bodywork teaches that breathing deeply is important to relax, to free yourself from mental occupation and to get more in contact with your feelings. But there is more: Breathing deeply helps to charge your sexual battery. Breathing deeply helps to postpone orgasm/ejaculation. Partners can circle and increase energy when the active partner inhales through the nose and exhales through the genitals, while the receptive, or other partner inhales through the genitals and exhales through the nose. (This is partly a mental process.) Partners can also synchronize inhaling and exhaling to tune into each other. In sex magick we breathe into the magical goal we visualize and/or affirm. And finally we can breathe our orgasmic energy into the chosen reality or intention.

The Kiss, sculpture of C. Brancusi, 1907 Strengthening exercises of the muscles in the pelvis will enable you to selectively increase and decrease sexual arousal. By deliberately contracting these muscles erections will be stronger, while erotic sensations and orgasms in both men and women will be intensified. Let's start with the pubococcygeus muscle on the pelvis floor. You'll get to know this muscle by deliberately stopping the flow of urine several times. The way of exercising this muscle is as follows: contract it as if you stop urinating and at the same time move it upward as if you wish to pull your genitals inside your belly. Women can put one or two fingers in the vagina doing this exercise and will notice that the vagina will gently contract too. Men will notice a bobbing up of the head of the penis during contractions. Advantages of this exercise for both sexes are stronger sexual feelings and curing/preventing of urinary stress incontinence. Further advantage for women is indirect stimulation of the clitoris and for men an increased erectile potency. The second important muscle system can be exercised by contracting the anal sphincter, as if you are trying to hold back the stool, again accompanied by upward movements of \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the genitals.

A good way of energizing yourself is the regular exercising of these muscles while visualizing the life energy spiraling upwards along your spine, through your head and moving downward to your genitals again through the front side of your body. In women the anal sphincter is connected with the vaginal sphincter and other vaginal muscles. By deliberate contractions women can learn to independently contract the vaginal sphincter, the muscles along the vagina wall and the anal sphincter. Why should they do that? Learning a fluid contraction that starts in the vaginal sphincter and spreads upwards to the womb, as if you are 'milking a cow' gives the penis a massage. You can also start these contractions at the cervix and work downwards to the vaginal sphincter. This way women increase the erotic feelings of both their partner and themselves. Contracting the vaginal sphincter during intercourse will help maintain male erection. Strong contractions of all vaginal muscles at the brink of his orgasm, followed by rhythmic 'milking' movements will intensify orgasm in men. Once you have learned how to control your pelvic muscles you can consciously relax them to take off sensual pressure at the point-of-no-return and thus postpone ejaculation. So contract them to arouse, and relax them to back off (this goes for both men and women). Practicing sex magick. \"O Lord, intoxicate me with the wine Of Thy Love. Place the chains of Thy slavery on My feet; Make me empty of all but Thy love, And in it destroy me and bring me Back to life. The hunger Thou has awakened culminates In fulfillment.\" Sufi master Sheikh Abdullah Ansari In this chapter I give you the basic structure of a sex magick ritual with the 'how's and 'why's while next chapter describes several possibilities for working alone, with one or maybe more partners. • First set a goal. What exactly do you want to achieve with your magick? Your goal can be any material attainment, like a new job, prosperity in business affairs, a pleasant house, whatever. Your goal can be the healing of yourself, another person, mother earth... Your intent can be improvement of an existing relationship or attraction of a new one. You may wish to (further) develop several qualities in yourself, or create an"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"excellent artistic piece. You may wish to embrace the inner lover, and establish a stronger connection with your higher self. You may wish to charge an amulet, talisman, or magical tools, etc.... Deeply desired wishes create the strongest magick! Then create something that makes it possible to laser-like concentrate on your goal/intent during the ritual. - This can be a short affirmation. During the ritual you can repeat the whole affirmation. Another possibility is to reduce this affirmation to a word that covers its central idea; this will be your magical word. Examples: the affirmation \"I am a successful business(wo)man\" becomes \"Success\". \"I request the universe to send me the best possible lover, or partner\" becomes \"Lover\" or \"Partner\". The idea behind it is that your subconsiousness now knows your full intent, therefore it is sufficient to only repeat your magical word during the ritual. - This can be a visualization of the new created reality. - It can be a drawing of what you want. - It can be a symbolic representation of your desire, like a suitable tarot card, rune, sigil, astrological or other symbol. - In case you do the ritual for someone else it can be helpful to also have a photograph of the person. - You can use a combination of the above. • Prepare your working space. Clean the space where the ritual will take place. Decorate it with candles, incense, flowers, gemstones or anything else you find appropriate. If you use symbols or other pictures make sure you can see them during the ritual. If you wish to play music, don't forget to put it on the repeat-button.

Take care: if you lose focus during orgasm, you will have had great sex but no magical ritual! Continue the ritual until both (or all) partners have reached orgasm. If you prefer working with a visualization: Start with visualizing very vividly the new reality; see yourself in the desired situation, feel your happiness about it, visualize it as bright and detailed as you can. If you work for somebody else, for instance in case of a healing, visualize their joy and enthusiasm in the new situation. When your visualization is complete to your idea, tell your mind that this is your focus, then mentally store it in your subconsiousness. Start making love with your partner or masturbating, no longer thinking about the visualization. At the brink of orgasm back off, recall your visualization and breathe your orgasmic energy in it. Continue the rhythm of arousal and backing off several times. Just before orgasm recall the visualization from your mind and breathe/channel your orgasm into it. Some words about orgasm: If you are a woman capable of having multiple orgasms (a series of orgasms quickly after one another), just enjoy, have them during the ritual and end with the final orgasm. If you are a man, here's the good news that men can learn to have multiples too; by coming close then backing off just before the point-of-no-return several times men can experience all the feelings of an orgasm without having an ejaculation. Some men have a series of small orgasms, some men experience them as bigger orgasms. If you can do this, end the ritual with final orgasm/ejaculation. Not all men know that most women need clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm; although there are erotic areas in the vagina most women need the pressure of the pubic bone of their partner against the clitoris or stimulation by hand during intercourse to have orgasm. It was not my intent to go deeper into this, but I saw a t.v.program about the female orgasm explaining that many men don't know where to locate the clitoris. In fact the clitoris is a tiny size female penis; it also swells during arousal and it is designed especially for female pleasure. You will find it where the inner lips meet at the top, it looks like a small knob and it desires the same soft caresses with hand (make it moist with some vaginal fluids), tongue or sucking as the male head of the penis. Other not so well known female erotic zones are (but not as sensitive as the clitoris): 1) the G-spot, about 1,5 inch inside the vagina, on the front side, you'll recognize it by the rougher texture than the rest of the vagina; when you stimulate this for a while first the woman often feels like urinating, but when she's through this feeling this place will become very sensitive and enable her an orgasm with ejaculation 2) a spot more or less"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"opposite the G-spot 3) the spot just above the opening of the urinary tube (just above the vagina). After orgasm you may wish to confirm your magick with the words: \"So mote it be\" and to give thanks to God/the Goddess and your partner. It is important to stay close the first minutes after intercourse with your genitals close together. There are two reasons for this: • When having sex your chakras open up and after orgasm you're completely open with part of your energy swirling around you. You need some time to recollect it and get energized again. If one partner rushes away after orgasm you can feel very disappointed, lonely and exhausted because of this reason. • After sex magick the sexual fluids of man and woman are charged with their magical intent; they can etherically absorb this power for their wellbeing and health through the vaginal walls and the head of the penis. It may be clear that when you use a condom it is very unwise to stay close together with your genitals. The charged sexual fluids can be used to charge an amulet or talisman by smearing some of it on them; in case your ritual was for gaining money you can smear it on a coin or paper money you had put on your altar; you can redraw the lines of a sigil for this ritual with it, mix the fluid with wine and drink it with your partner, etc. In sex magick the charged sexual fluids have become the sacred elixir of life, and are in no way dirty. If however you are carrying a sexual transmittable disease it is best to skip this part. When you are doing sex magick alone please know that your sexual fluids form a complete sacrament, although they now contain one polarity, not two. • End the ritual with banishment. The heightened energy of your ritual may have attracted astral beings. Make sure to keep them at a distance by reconfirming your banishment, like for instance a visualized circle of protection. \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Danae, by Gustav Klimt.

The woman and her Moon The days before the menstruation a larger amount of hormones circulates in the female body, not only increasing her emotions but also her magical power. During menstruation this extra power leaves her body; this can give an extra dimension to the elixir, but please be very careful to only use this when the woman is in good health. After all menstruation is also a natural monthly cleaning period for her body. Not all women feel like having sex in this period. But those who do can feel strongly accepted in all their feminine aspects by having intercourse these days. Sexual union during the (pre)menstruation days can often relief the cramps many women experience during their period. I have not read it in any book, but it's quite logical that the day of ovulation is also an extreme powerful day for the woman, even apart from the fact that she can get pregnant then. It is her personal full moon - but don't forget the condom, or do oral sex magick.

But there are more possibilities and variations. You may wish to take a look at them and consider to implement them in your sex magickal practice. Solo sex magick \"Hey, don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love!\" Woody Allen To many of us the word masturbation has a bad taste. It is said to be sinful and make you deaf, lame and blind (?) Let's be honest and admit that almost all human beings masturbate since the discovery of their sexuality in childhood. Masturbation is a very good way to overall self-acceptance and respect for your body as an earthly home for your spirit. If you practice physical self-love this way I guarantee you a much greater feeling of satisfaction and calmness of mind then when you use it as a quick way to get rid of tension. The above mentioned quote of Woody Allen makes me smile, but it contains truth: accepting and enjoying self-stimulation is making love with your inner lover. After this intro it won't surprise you that many sex magicians advice to start practicing sex magick with masturbation. It's simply the best way to learn to know your body, to explore your individual reactions and learn how to prolong orgasm. Another reason is that it makes you independent of a partner; it is a powerful sex magick technique in itself. And this explains why most sex magickal acts are auto-erotic. The best known solo sex magick practice is one person raising magical energy by self-stimulation. Drawing of a masturbating woman, Gustav Klimt Another possibility is viyou while you're masturbating.

Several magicians advice the position woman-on-top for sex magick; in this position the woman controls the depth and rhythm of penetration, she can get clitoral stimulation, and most men need more time to reach orgasm. All good reasons to use this position, but even more important is your personal preference. And you might wish to change positions as well; for this reason it is practical to place your symbol/sigil on different places in the room - or draw it with bodypaint on your partner's body! Intercourse positions can be seen as asana's, yoga-positions, each having a specific way of freeing and directing energies. I came across some considerations on certain positions: • The famous missionary position (man-on-top): here the chakra's of the partners are placed opposite each other and partners can look into each others eyes; this enhances intimacy, contact, healing and energy. A good position for a man to reach orgasm. This position is advised if you're doing magick for a positive change in the man's life. • An interesting variation for sex magick: still man-on-top, but the woman holds her legs together after penetration and does not move; only the man is active giving her his energy, she holds all this sexual energy and directs it into the universe. I would name this a good position to do magick for a mutual goal - or for something the woman wishes to realize. • Woman-on-top (cowgirl or camel-position): this woman-active position is good to do magick for a goal the woman wishes to realize. The woman gets more stimulation and the man tends to ejaculate later. • Woman-on-top-reversed (with her face looking at her partner's feet): in this position there's no eye-contact, but it can be very stimulating for both partners. A good position to do magick for a friend of the woman (she receives much of his energy and can direct it into the universe). • Side-to-side-positions: both partners are equally active/receptive; their chakras are placed opposite each other and their eyes meet - what means a lot of contact and exchange of energies.

Every participant must know how to raise, control and direct energies. They must be determined to work magick with their sexuality; if their aim is to sexually freak out with many partners they will ruin the ritual. In a group ritual it is absolutely not possible to cross barriers; the group has to agree on possible borders on beforehand. If someone namely does something another member of the group feels uncomfortable with, the whole energy chain will be broken and the ritual will be worthless. Generally spoken group rituals can follow the techniques described under solo and duo sex magick. They can be masturbatory, in the form of having intercourse, or in the form of a large oral circle. Of course establishing an atmosphere of contact, trust and openness is very important within a group ritual. A group meditation, holding hands in a circle feeling the energy circulating, or maybe chanting a mantra together are very good to start with. A larger group will have a leader, a person not participating in the ritual, but spiritually and magically guiding the group. The leader will do the banishments and take care of the timing and process of the ritual. This gives the group the opportunity to be completely sexually involved, raising enormous energy. The leader will from time to time ask the group to spread the raised energy amongst the group and to focus it into the direction of the chosen goal. The leader will also harmonize the energies by directing them with his will, and raising them if needed, from a place with much energy to a place within the group with less energy. And at the peak of the sexual energy the leader will ask the group to work towards orgasm and channel all their energy into the magical goal. \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I would like to end this piece with the suggestion of a group ritual for the healing of mother earth.
