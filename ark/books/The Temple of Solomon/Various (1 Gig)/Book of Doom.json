Caput Secundum: The Order of Algol and Sorcery 2.1. Sorcery is a spiritual science that encompasses the whole of the human being. 2.2. It involves knowing your own nature and the nature of the universe at large to bring about the change that you want in your life. 2.3. This change is always under YOUR control, not under control of a deity or of any other being above the clouds. 2.4. Sorcerers know themselves to be gods, and they act accordingly. 2.6. This means that sorcery is not for the irresponsible, nor for the weak. 2.7. Sorcerers do not worship any force in the universe. 2.8. They control it! 2.9. They do not bow to anything nor anyone! 2.10. Therefore, if you feel you need to lean on something, the Left Path and the Black Arts are not for you! 2.11. The sorcerers are the powerful, the proud, and the resourceful in the universe. 2.12. Therefore they are not religionists of any kind. 2.13. O.A.I. stands for Ordo Algolis Interstellaris vel Infernalis. 2.14. It is an interstellar order of black magicians that is older than mankind. 2.15. It is for the proud, for the powerful, and for the resourceful."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2.16. Algol symbolizes the principle of creative dynamics in the universe at the threshold of creation. 2.17. Structured deities that emanate from Algol take undeserved credit for some creation in the past. 2.18. Seeded by Algol, the O.A.I. was one of the most powerful dynamic and creative forces in human history. Caput Tertium: Imperium Infernalis 3.1. True power expresses itself in its effects. 3.2. It is not in need to express itself in exterior form. 3.3. The choice is yours: you may wield power openly or in secret; in either case you can benefit from the fruits of it. 3.4. Hierarchies of spirits reflect processes of power. 3.5. With any hierarchy of spirits you have the keys to specific expressions of power. 3.6. In the beginning is chaos. 3.7. Algol is the gate of chaos which creates the worlds. 3.8. The world creates from the below of the chaos to the above. 3.9. Created deities will always claim to have created the worlds. 3.10. This is so because created deities can neither understand themselves nor can they understand time. 3.11. The Great Infernal Empire is the threshold of chaos and abyss. 3.12. There are four main realms in the Great Infernal Empire. 3.13. The first realm of the Great Infernal Empire is the Infernal Government, with Lucifer, Belial, Satan, Beelzebub, Astaroth, and Pluto. 3.14. The second realm of the Great Infernal Empire is the domain of the Seven Infernal Grand Dukes, whose names are: Mephistophilis, Ariel, Anifel, Marbuel, Aziel, Aziabel, and Barbuel. 3.15. The third realm of the Great Infernal Empire is the domain of the five Grand Ministers and Secret Infernal Counsels, whose names are: Asmodeus, Leviathan, Baal, Belphegor, and Lucifuge. 3.16. The fourth realm of the Great Infernal Empire is the domain of the Twelve Dukes, whose names are: Ashmunaday, Kedemel, Set, Hasmoday, Sorath, Hekate, Lilith, Barzabel, Behemoth, Nambroth, Zazel, and Hismael. 3.17. Study well what the spirits of the Infernal Hierarchy have to tell you, and all the power will be yours. 3.18. The structure of the O.A.I. is following the principles of the Infernal Hierarchy and so should all groups that are truly Left Path, small and large, from the top to the bottom. Translator's Note: The Algolic spiritual Hierarchy is somewhat reflected in the grimoire \"the Threefold Coercion of Hell by Doctor Johannes Faust,\" translated into English by K.H.W. However, the names of the infernal spirits have been somewhat distorted in this German classic. The hierarchy of the O.A.I. is indeed following these ancient principles as shown in this chapter,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and so is the hierarchy of all branches of the O.A.I.
