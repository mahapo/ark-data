The subconscious mind inspires, guides and is a permanent store house of memory. Our mind remembers everything we see, feel and experience but to recall is difficult. It is said that the subconscious mind has a memory capacity of 70-100 trillion images because all our feelings, emotions and experiences are stored within us as an image or sound. Just as a computer digitizes everything, our brain too does the same.Subconscious mind never sleeps, never rests and is always on duty because it controls our heartbeat, circulation of blood, regulates digestion, assimilates, harmonizes and eliminates. It controls all the vital processes and functions of our body and knows the answers to all our problems.The objective mind learns from observation, experience, education and its great function is reasoning, whereas the subjective mind performs its highest function when our objective senses are in abeyance.Thoughts are conveyed via the conscious mind to the subconscious by impression made in the brain cells like an image or a movie. It uses every bit of information gathered in our life time and draws all the energy and wisdom within us to bring solutions to our problems.Suppose one had been bitten by a dog at the age of 10, one will continue to be scared of dogs for the rest of his/her life viewing it from the childhood experience. This is because our subconscious mind remembers the incident. The conscious mind may forget but the subconscious mind remembers in greatest detail unless the event is cancelled from the memory.Subconscious mind is always awake whether one is asleep, unconscious, under drug or alcohol effect or under coma. One of its functions is to guard us from harm and danger, yet ironically it also causes illness and even self destruction.Subconscious mind is infinite intelligence possessed by man beyond time and space, and it helps us to receive new thoughts, ideas, business plans, discoveries, inventions, and http://www.clintonvisitsindia.com/books/hypnosisb..._sub_conscious_mind_the_treasure_within_you.shtml (2 of 7) [10/26/2002 9:29:32 AM]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Hypnosis : The Sub conscious Mind the treasure within youknowledge of nature.Subconscious mind has the habit of taking everything literally. If we keep on thinking that we will never succeed in a particular venture, it is most likely that we will not because we are blocking all positive energy flow into the subconscious. This results only in negative energy getting attracted. Therefore, it is we who are responsible for our successes and failures in life.If we have conveyed an erroneous concept to our subconscious mind the method of overcoming it is by repetition of constructive and harmonious thoughts, positive attitude and visualizing a happy ending rather than negative thoughts and suggestions.Doctors have recognized this fact about the mind hence, however complex the operation maybe, they keep on encouraging the patients just before an operation.During the post operative period visitors are not allowed near the patient because any negative suggestion given will go deep into the patient's subconscious mind thereby damaging whatever had been done to rectify the patient's state of health through the operation.It is very important that we do not use negative suggestions with growing children as it gets rooted in their subconscious mind and reflects later in his/her behavior. This effect can be seen in their behavior, hostility, anxiety, lack of confidence, etc. Whatever one believes in one's mind is what we experience physically in the outside world. We have two sides of life objective-subjective, visible-invisible, thought-manifestation.Even prayers and beliefs are positive signals which we give to our subconscious mind as something acceptable and true. The thought which is acceptable as true will automatically execute itself. When we believe we are healthy we will remain healthy as our subconscious mind keeps our immune system in perfect condition.Bhagwan Sathya Sai Baba says \"Faith is the root of tree of mankind on which it survives\".http://www.clintonvisitsindia.com/books/hypnosisb..._sub_conscious_mind_the_treasure_within_you.shtml (3 of 7) [10/26/2002 9:29:32 AM]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Hypnosis : The Sub conscious Mind the treasure within youFaith is the starting point of our spiritual and mental progress. In India we can find umpteen examples of faith, belief and superstitions. These can be explained scientifically whereas many are blindly followed. Faith and belief which are for our own and universal good are acceptable. However, faith which brings injury to others, either mental or physical is not acceptable.Baba said we should develop a sense of Viveka (discrimination) which will help us to demarcate good and bad things. This demarcation comes from Jnana (knowledge). A child who utters bad words may not know the meaning of it hence one should explain the meaning of the word to him so that he does not repeat it.While praying we do not give any thoughts to negative conditions. This attitude of mind brings a harmonious union of conscious and subconscious mind which releases the healing power.In India, we frequently visit temples and shrines and pray. Temples and holy places have positive energies due to the repetition of God's name, songs, mantras, etc, which soothe our mind. We feel calm and respond in these places with openness. Our subconscious mind unfolds the knot of our problems and gives us the solutions.During every moment of our life we harbor more negative energies than positive one. Whatever we see around us makes an impact on the subconscious mind and remains deep rooted till reprogramming is done.Dr. Bruce Goldberg in his book has proved that subconscious mind does not only have memory a of our present life but also of the past lives. The subconscious mind may not want us to know anything of the past as per the wisdom it possesses and may decide not to give us any information at all of the past lives that may affect our present life.However, by scientific hypnosis and past life regression, anyone can go back and witness their life as it was.Some people having peculiar behavioral problems, have been regressed to their past lives to find the cause of the problem http://www.clintonvisitsindia.com/books/hypnosisb..._sub_conscious_mind_the_treasure_within_you.shtml (4 of 7) [10/26/2002 9:29:32 AM]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Hypnosis : The Sub conscious Mind the treasure within youin their present life. When the cause is healed the problem disappears instantly.Subconscious mind never grows old. It is ageless, timeless and endless. Hence it is very important to develop patience, kindness, humility, will power, responsibility for oneself, peace, harmony, hope and brotherly love towards every creation of GOD.The subconscious mind can be dealt with creative visualization, positive affirmations and self-hypnosis to bring harmony and balance in all aspects of your life.How negative attitudes affect a personl One parent used to tell his child almost everyday, \"You will become a useless person and never become something in life.\" When the child became an adult, he was a failure in all aspects of life. Finally, he became a priest and found solace. Parents should be cautious and not use any negative words or commands while dealing with their children.l A teacher used to motivate his pupils by saying, \"Try and try again, you will succeed. Work hard and pray to God for success.\" Thus his student turned out to be toppers in academics and brought many laurels to the school. The encouraging words of the teacher worked like magic. (It is better to keep on encouraging, rewarding and praising the children for slightest good done by them. After all there is a deep desire within all of us to be appreciated.l A widow used to tell her daughter after puberty to be careful of men as they were cheats, opportunists and sex maniacs. This influenced her and she hated men till her late thirties until she met a loving and caring man. She let go of her mother's influence. (The mother had spoilt an innocent child's attitude towards men just because she herself was a victim of terrible experiences).l A young boy when caught masturbating by his father was told that he would become insane. That boy became impotent. Later his problem vanished after scientific counseling and reassurance. (Often impotence is not an organic defect but arises due to deep emotional guilt http://www.clintonvisitsindia.com/books/hypnosisb..._sub_conscious_mind_the_treasure_within_you.shtml (5 of 7) [10/26/2002 9:29:32 AM]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Hypnosis : The Sub conscious Mind the treasure within youwhich can be easily cured by reprogramming the subconscious mind through positive affirmations.)l A man met with an accident and fractured his leg. He happened to overhear his doctor saying that he would never be normal again and that he would always limp. This man although clinically certified to be fit, walked with a limp until he met a mind trainer who succeeded in canceling the negative thought from his mind.There are innumerable examples to prove beyond doubt that subconscious mind remembers the past life as well as present. There is chance that our conscious mind may sometimes forget certain incidences but our subconscious mind remembers everything. It also causes all the emotional and physical disorders arising due to these deep rooted memories.Any passing comments or trivial statements can have a devastating effect on our subconscious mind because it is not argumentative or analytical. It accepts all the statements directly on the face value.It is very imperative that we do not become sad and depressed as negative thoughts crowd the subconscious mind which could react immediately or maybe after several years. It is the responsibility of elders and parents to be very careful in using words when they are amidst children in the formative years as during this time the mind takes concrete shape for many years to come.Some positive tips for perennial happiness:l If someone has hurt you physically or verbally, forgive him or her.l If someone tries to belittle you ignore them.l If someone you advise does not wish to listen to you, leave that person to face his own fate.l If you help someone, do not expect anything in return. Conflicts between spouses or parent-children arises due to very high expectations.l If you have a special talent or God gift do not become egoistic and haughty about it or consider yourself superior to others.l If someone is jealous of you and your achievements, sympathies with them.http://www.clintonvisitsindia.com/books/hypnosisb..._sub_conscious_mind_the_treasure_within_you.shtml (6 of 7) [10/26/2002 9:29:32 AM]"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Hypnosis : The Sub conscious Mind the treasure within youl Learn to channels your desire into higher creativity and consciousness by adopting meditation.l Keep away from malice as they will not give you perpetual happiness.l Learn to set new goals in life as this will keep your life interesting and full of zeal and zest.Baba says, \"Life is a challenge, face it. Life is love, enjoy it. Life is a song, sing it\". Love is the common denominator for all maladies in life. So we need to develop unconditional love for everything-our work, profession, family, neighbors, GOD, and people we meet socially.
