The OBE is also called AstralProjection in much of the literature. I'll use these terms interchangeably in this book. Simply put, an OBEis an experience in which you seem to be consciously apart from your physical body.This book is not a complete detailed discourse on the OBE; there are dozens of books on out-of-bodyexperiences, with stories, theories, and good information. Rather, this book offers a new perspective onthe OBE, based on the author's experience and point of view. My goal is not to reiterate the old theories,but to present new information based on what I've learned and provide tools to induce OBEs.A good word to describe an OBE is \"Escapade,\" which has the same root as the word \"Escape.\"According to the American Heritage Dictionary, an escapade is:An adventurous action that usually violates conventional standards of behavior.It's an escape from our bodies. It is adventurous. And it certainly violates conventional standards ofbehavior!Most OBEs have common features. For instance, the subjects often see their own physical body duringthe experience, like any other object in the room. They usually report having \"ghostly\" bodies that canpass through solid objects during the experience. Sometimes their ghostly bodies are even seen by others!They also report floating or flying, and often report seeing places or events that were out of eyesight.There are many books about Out-of-Body Experiences with many different approaches, from scientific tothe occult (see the bibliography for more information). Many of these books give the readers sternwarnings against trying it themselves, for fear of: death, disease, possession, insanity, heart attack andeven the fear of being mistaken for dead and buried alive! I'm writing this book to try to dispel some ofthese myths.Is it Scary?Of course it's scary. Anytime we face the unknown, it is frightening. But approaching anything with fearis harmful. Early European sailors believed the Earth was flat and they could sail off the edge. Becauseof their fear of the unknown, they concluded it was dangerous to sail too far west. When they conqueredtheir fear and went bravely ahead, not only did they discover a whole new world, they also made thetransition from two-dimensional thinking to three-dimensional thinking about their reality. Likewise, ifwe can conquer our fears, we will also discover a whole new world, and we will make the transition fromthree-dimensional thinking to four-or-more-dimensional thinking about our reality.All the great pioneers have set aside their fears, at least temporarily, and gone ahead despite the dangers.Courage is not the ability to walk into danger without fear. Courage is the ability to walk into adangerous or frightening situation and think to yourself, \"Yes, I'm scared--I'm scared to death--but that'snot going to stop me.\" The thing I liked most about the book, Dune by Frank Herbert, is the saying that\"Fear is the mind-killer.\"intro.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/intro.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:16:14 AM]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"What if it's dangerous?\"Many things in life are dangerous. Driving a car is dangerous. Crossing the street is dangerous. We dothose things anyway. Sometimes walking into a dangerous situation is our best course of action. In herbook, Out-of-Body Experiences, Janet Mitchell presents the following analogy:My parents did not keep me from walking or tell me that I couldn't, even though they knew Imight accidentally walk in front of a moving vehicle; they did teach me how to cross thestreet safely. (Pg. 84)I'm not saying we should walk blindly into the street; I am saying that if we look both ways, we cansafely \"cross the street\" of the out-of-body experience, and add a whole new dimension to our lives. Inother words, \"No guts, no glory.\"\"What good is it?\"We can gain immeasurably from the OBE. Almost every book I've read on OBEs says that OBEs have aprofound impact on people. People come away with a new attitude toward life and death.With OBEs we may learn about the conditions after death and what \"The great beyond\" is really like. Wemight use it as a spring board for developing psychic abilities. We might discover (for ourselves) thetruths and myths behind the world's great religions. If science can reproduce OBEs in the lab, they maydiscover the scientific laws governing mind and matter that psychic abilities are only hinting at today.Some people have even suggested the possibility of using it for industrial espionage, covert intelligenceand similar applications. Above all in importance, I believe astral projection can help us become morespiritual.I personally believe that true \"value\" is not to be found in material things, but in spirituality. Whatever\"spirituality\" means to you is okay in your life, as long as you don't \"go off the deep end\" with it.Spirituality should not be used as a license to justify immorality, nor should it be forcefully pushed onother people. Spirituality is a personal thing, and it means something different to everyone.The American Heritage Dictionary defines \"Spiritual\" as:1. Of, relating to, consisting of, or having the nature of spirit; not tangible or material. 2. Of,concerned with, or affecting the soul. 3. Of, from, or pertaining to God; deific. 4. Of orbelonging to a church or religion; sacred. 5. Pertaining to or having the nature of spirits;supernatural.What better way is there to learn about spiritual things than to experience directly, \"the nature of spirit;not tangible or material?\" If you leave your body, you are spirit. You are not tangible or material. Youwill be concerned with and affecting your soul. And you will have the nature of spirits. You'll actually fitthree out of five definitions of \"spiritual!\"Having OBEs does not automatically make you spiritual. However, all it took was one good look at myinanimate body for me to realize that we are spiritual beings, and the \"next life\" is not so far off!This book has two parts. Part One is the story of how I changed from skeptic to believer, and what youcan expect to experience if you attempt to have OBEs yourself.

My childhood wasnormal except for a few unusual experiences that will be described later.Before I started Kindergarten, met a boy named Brian, who was about three years older, and we becamefriends. Brian was a good friend, but he had a bad habit of lying. Brian felt that lying made him seemmore knowledgeable and important than other kids, and he loved to be in that position of power. At thatyoung age, I was naive and always asking questions, but I had no concept of dishonesty. Hanging aroundBrian, it didn't take me long to find out what a lie was. Before long, I didn't trust anything that Brian saidto me. Still, Brian was my only friend and there were no other kids my age in the area. Instead ofabandoning our friendship, I took it as a challenge. I still valued his friendship, but I had to learn toseparate the fact from the fiction. I was forced to use logic to tell when he was lying and when he wastelling the truth. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't. But I got better at it by verifying some ofthe facts with grownups I knew I could trust.Before too long, my parents intervened and told me I couldn't see Brian again because he was a \"badinfluence.\" They were right. But Brian's friendship taught me some valuable lessons when I was at animpressionable age. First, I learned that you can't believe everything you hear or read. I gained a realappreciation for the \"truth\" and I learned to question everything. Second, I learned how to use reason,deduction and logic. My love of the truth turned into a love for scientific knowledge, an insatiablecuriosity, and a thirst for knowledge and exploration.When I entered grade school, I made my first important discovery: The school library. Most of the kidswould run to the fiction section to grab the story books. I would run to the shelf marked \"SCIENCE\" andI'd read text books. I would read any book as long as it was scientific: dinosaurs, biology, lasers, botany,archaeology, astronomy and anything else that crossed my curious mind in a particular week. Evenbefore I could read I would learn by looking at the pictures.My mom used to take me to the public library and let me wander around while she picked out books. Ofcourse, I'd go straight for the science books there too. But in the public library, children's books weremostly story books. So I would wander around the adult section and look for science books. I rememberone day when I stumbled into the anatomy section of the adult books. I wonder what my parents wouldhave said if they found out I knew all about sex and the reproductive system at the age of six! Iremember arguing with other six-year-olds about where babies came from. They insisted on storks andcabbage-patches, and I just couldn't talk any sense into them.I got a reputation for being a \"know it all\" or a \"brain.\" I didn't care for that status at all, because peoplecouldn't relate to a \"brain\" and everyone resents a \"know-it-all.\" I did my best to fight against myreputation, and stuck to a small group of friends.In high school I became interested in the field of computers and my curiosity led me to study computersin my spare time. I took several computer short-courses offered by the University of Minnesota. After Ihad taken every short-course the University had to offer, I spent my free time reading computer manualschap01.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap01.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:16:29 AM]"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"and writing computer games. My face became well known in the University computer labs. I oftenchuckled when people twice my age would ask me for help on their programming class assignments.After high school, I entered the University of Minnesota majoring in the field of Computer Science.During that time I started having Out-of-Body Experiences (OBEs), and it changed the course of my life.Perhaps it can change your life too!EXERCISE 1AffirmationsThis \"exercise\" section, which appears at the end of each chapter, is designed to present exercises andpointers to readers who are interested in learning to have out-of-body experiences. The exercises will besimple in the early chapters and get more complicated in later chapters.This particular exercise is an affirmation. An affirmation is like a New Year's resolution; something yousay to yourself to strengthen your ability to do something. It's not enough just to say the affirmation, youshould think about it first, then say it slowly to yourself a few times. Each time you say an affirmation,you should try to put emotion behind your words and actually believe what you are saying.Affirmations work for many reasons. First, it's a way to clearly communicate with your subconscious,and we all know how powerful the subconscious is from hypnosis studies.Second, many people in metaphysics believe in a higher consciousness, sometimes called your \"HigherSelf,\" or \"Oversoul,\" which is even more powerful than your subconscious. Affirmations also allow youto communicate your intentions to your Oversoul which can help you reach your goals.Third, many people in metaphysics believe that your beliefs directly affect your experience. Affirmationsmake it easier to change your belief-system, and make positive changes in your life.The most effective affirmations are the kind you make for yourself. They should be short, succinct andstated in a positive way. For example, use \"I want\" messages instead of \"I don't want\" messages. Statethe changes you want in your life and what you are willing to do to make it real. For this exercise, youshould do affirmations based on your want to have OBEs. You can either create your own affirmation oruse the one given below:I want to have out-of-body experiences. I want to leave my body. I know that the Universewill respond to my needs and wants quickly, efficiently and joyously. In return, I willpractice OBE exercises, cooperate with the Universe, follow my impulses, act on myintuitions, share my knowledge, spread my love and cooperate with my own Higher Self.Click here to view next chapterchap01.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap01.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:16:29 AM]"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Or click here to return to the indexchap01.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap01.html (3 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:16:29 AM]"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2My ChildhoodI grew up in a hectic house with three brothers and one sister. My dad was a religious man in his ownquiet way. He generally kept quiet about his religion. Once or twice I heard him mention Edgar Cayce inpassing, but I ignored most of this, dismissing it as either \"occult\" or \"unscientific.\" As a rule, he neverexposed his kids to occult ideas.My mom was a devout Catholic, and she raised her kids as \"good\" Catholics, that is, the kind who go tochurch every Sunday, say their prayers, and pretty much forget about God and religion during the week.At any rate, I grew up with a healthy sense of right and wrong, and never used drugs. I was the only kidin my high school who never tried marijuana. I still haven't tried drugs; drugs are for people who are lazyand lack the will to induce their own, natural altered states of consciousness.Once I asked my mom if she remembered anything unusual about my childhood. She told me thatwhenever I got really sick, I would sleepwalk. To be precise, I would get up in the middle of the nightand dance around in circles chanting like an Indian shaman. Of course, I wasn't conscious at the time.When I got sick, I only remember a strange sensation that used to terrify me: When I drifted off to sleep,I had a terrifying \"nightmare.\" I would \"dream\" that I held a tiny grain of salt in the palm of my hand.Then my consciousness would shrink to a terrifyingly small size until the grain of salt looked like askyscraper. Terrified of being crushed by the salt, I would wake up screaming.I didn't consider myself a psychic child. Nonetheless, I had a few experiences worth noting.One day, when I was perhaps 10 or 12 years old, I was very depressed. I don't even remember why I wasdepressed, but my depression was so severe that I actually prayed to die. Sometime after I had gone tobed, I awoke to find myself whooshing up, out of my body, escorted by what I thought was an angel. Ithought I had died, and I was amazed that I hadn't felt any pain during the separation. I thought that deathwould be painful, but it wasn't.Finally I came to a halt before a large, tremendously powerful invisible being, whom I immediatelythought was God. The being told me it was time to go, and I understood immediately what that meant:Death.Then I got a yearning to go back. I was homesick. I felt guilty about wishing to die. And I knew that myparents would be very sad about my death. So I begged and pleaded to be brought back to Earth. \"Why?\"I was asked. I thought for a moment, searching for an answer. I said, \"Everyone there thinks that death ispainful and sad. I have to go back to tell everyone that death is painless, and joyful.\"After thinking about it, \"God\" consented and I was escorted back. I awoke amazed at the realism I hadexperienced. I forced myself to believe it was a dream and nothing more.Another experience happened when I was a little older, perhaps 14 or 15. I used to have playful wrestlingmatches with two other boys.One day we were talking about wrestling, and got on the subject of the world-famous wrestling holdchap02.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap02.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:16:40 AM]"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"called \"the sleeper hold.\" The hold would knock an opponent out by cutting off blood circulation to thebrain. Anyway, we all wondered what it would be like to be knocked out. FD was the strongest of thethree and the third boy was afraid, so I agreed to let FD knock me out with a bear-hug.We went outside and he gave me the strongest bear-hug I've ever experienced. I couldn't breathe andsoon became unconscious. It was like waking from a dream; this world was a dream and I awoke to areality more real and vivid than this world is. I saw the illusion of this existence on Earth dispelled! Itfaded away and I didn't regret it. Soon I found myself in the \"real\" world in a huge city that I alreadyknew.My memory seemed to return--Yes--I had gone to sleep and dreamed of a little place called \"Earth\" andnow I was awake. \"That was a silly dream\" I thought, and I soon forgot all about \"Earth.\" I continued mylife, just like before I fell asleep. I lived in that fantastic city for years and years--centuries it seemed. Ilived there so long that I COMPLETELY forgot all about Earth. For hundreds of years I had forgottenEarth. If someone was to ask me about it, I couldn't remember, since it happened so long ago.Then one day I was walking to a store. Suddenly a confusing loss of direction hit me and I felt myselffalling. Suddenly I opened my eyes only to see strange leaves, the sky and FD and the other boy lookingat me! Where was I now? How did I get here? What happened? Then I remembered: Hundreds of yearsago, I fell asleep and found myself here. This place was called \"Earth\" and was a part of a weird dream. Imust have fallen asleep again. Slowly my Earthly memory returned. I asked the boys how long I hadbeen unconscious. They said only a few minutes. They asked me what happened, and I told them I didn'twant to talk about it.A third psychic experience is as follows: I was riding with my father in his truck and we went under arailroad bridge viaduct. It was near Columbia Park in Columbia Heights Minnesota, only a few blocksfrom where I lived in Minneapolis. We drove under the bridge, and a train was passing over the track. Igot a very uncomfortable feeling and \"imagined\" the train falling from the track onto the truck and street,crushing us. I said, \"I hate this\" to my dad. After we had gone through the viaduct I asked my dad, \"Howoften do they jump the track?\" My dad (who worked as a clerk for a railroad) said that it was nearlyimpossible for a train to derail; it was especially rare at a bridge or viaduct. Within a week, a trainderailed at that very viaduct. I was about 14 at the time.Some people may say that these psychic experiences would suggest I was born with some naturalabilities. However, I disagree. A couple of unusual events during childhood does not make you\"psychic.\" My childhood was normal.Once when I was young I overheard my dad talking to my brother and he mentioned a thing called \"astralprojection.\" I asked my brother what it was, but I was brushed aside with a simple, \"That's where peoplefly outside their bodies.\" It sounded interesting to me, but too unscientific--like a fairy tale. I waitedpatiently until the next time my mom took me to the library, then I tried to find \"Astral\" in the cardcatalog. The library didn't have any books on it at the time, so I forgot all about the subject.chap02.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap02.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:16:40 AM]"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"EXERCISE 2PrayerMany people from all walks of life believe that we have spiritual guides or guardians of some sort.Christians call them Guardian Angels. Zoroastrians call them the Fervashi. Spiritualists call them spiritguides. Whatever you call them, they can hear our silent thoughts and prayers, and they can help us inmany ways. They can even help us have OBEs.Since our guides are here to help us spiritually, this exercise is to pray to your guides to help you haveOBEs. I can't tell you what to pray, but I can give you an example which I sometimes use:I pray to God, the All That Is, and to my guides, helpers and any other benevolent beings, toplease help me achieve my goal of exploring consciously while out of my body.

My brotherJoe knew my dad was interested in the occult, so for Father's Day, Joe gave him the book Journeys Outof the Body by Robert A. Monroe. I remembered searching the card catalog as a child, so after my dadhad finished reading it, I asked him if I could borrow it, and he said yes.Monroe explained his OBEs in such a logical, scientific manner that I read the book faster than I'd everread before. I didn't really believe Monroe's claims, but I liked his approach. His book urged me not totake his word for it, but to try it myself.I decided to take Monroe up on his offer, and follow his techniques to see for myself if these experienceswere real or just hype, fantasy or dreams. That night, before I went to bed, I attempted astral projectionfor the first time. I had memorized Monroe's method earlier and I decided to close my eyes and try it.The first step was to relax. I spent a long time relaxing completely. The next step, which was quite a bitharder, was to drift between waking and sleeping consciousness. I found myself drifting into sleep onceor twice, and I yanked myself back to full consciousness each time, being careful not to move my fullyrelaxed body. It took quite a while before I felt comfortable enough to go on to the next step: clearing mymind of all thoughts.This was harder yet. Every time I heard a noise I would be distracted and my mind would start to wander.Then my body started itching in the most distracting way. As soon as I'd scratch an itch, another new itchwould take its place. Even after I conquered most of my itches (and ignored the rest) it was hard to keepmy mind from wandering.At one point, I found I could hold my mind blank for several minutes, and I decided that would be longenough to go on to the next step: using imaginary lines of force to call \"the vibrations.\" I followedMonroe's method to the letter, carefully pausing between each step in the process. I was just about to giveup when I felt a heavy \"TWANG\" in my head. If felt as if the lines of force had somehow become realand had touched a 110-volt power line. I thought, \"Oops. Maybe this isn't such a good idea.\" I tried topull myself back to normal consciousness by retracting my imaginary lines of force. I quickly pulled thelines of force back toward me, but much to my surprise, the \"electricity\" I felt at the end of those lineswas also being pulled toward me. It was like I had been fishing and I felt a sharp bite at the end of myfishing pole: I quickly tried to pull my fishing line out of the water, but I only managed to set the hook,and pull in a fish. And it was quite a fish: A kind of electrical \"vibration\" violently swept into my body,filling my body with an electric-like shock and a terrible roaring noise. I thought I was being electrocutedand my first reaction was sheer panic. I could hear my heart beating wildly in mad fear, but I waspowerless to control it.Somehow I could see through my closed eyelids. I looked up and I saw a blue ring of electrical fireflying right toward my head. It was about a foot in diameter, with the energy sparks about aninch-and-a-half thick, and it was bright blue. I instinctively tried to raise my arms to protect myself fromthe impact, but I found myself paralyzed and unable to move my arms. The ring of blue energy started tochap03.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap03.html (1 of 2) [5/4/1999 9:16:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"slip over my forehead and I looked away, afraid to see what would happen next. I started fighting wildlyto regain control of my body and the \"vibrations\" slowly smoothed down and died out. When thevibrations faded completely, I could move my body again.I shook my arms and legs, and rejoiced that I hadn't lost the ability to move them, happy that I wascompletely in my body. \"My God,\" I thought to myself, \"It worked! Monroe wasn't lying! There AREother worlds!\"EXERCISE 3RelaxationOne of the key factors in leaving the body is relaxation. The body should be relaxed as completely aspossible. If the physical body isn't completely relaxed, it may be very difficult to turn your focus awayfrom the body.Some laboratory experiments suggest that the physical body may be even more relaxed during an OBEthan it is during a normal sleep state. Learning to relax your body to such a degree (without fallingasleep) can be difficult, but it has its rewards. Learning to physically relax can lower blood pressure andcounteract stress. You'll feel better and live longer by practicing relaxation regularly.For this exercise, you should learn to relax your body at will, completely and quickly. You should learnto relax every fiber and tissue of your body. One common method of relaxation is to get into acomfortable position, and slowly go through every limb from the feet up, tensing and relaxing everymuscle in that limb.Special care should taken to completely relax the muscles in your face, including your eyelids, forehead,and jaw muscles. It's all right to open your mouth for maximum relaxation.After finishing this first relaxation, go back and slowly check every muscle again, making sure it'srelaxed. If there is tension in any muscle, repeat the procedure and check every muscle again.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap03.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap03.html (2 of 2) [5/4/1999 9:16:51 AM]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4Beliefs Blown to BitsAfter my experience with the vibrations, I got up out of bed and walked out into the living room to tellsomebody, anybody, that it was all real. My mom was in bed sleeping already, and my dad was asleep inhis favorite chair in front of the television, and I didn't want to wake him. I walked into the kitchen andgot a glass of water, occasionally shaking my arms and legs to make sure I was completely inside mybody. After a few minutes I walked back to my bedroom and lay down, but I could not sleep. I could notstop thinking about the encounter and its implications.First, it was the most terrifying experience of my life. It felt like the vibrations were harming my body,and the roaring, hissing sound only scared me more. I had confronted mankind's two biggest fears: fearof the unknown and fear of death. My scientific self couldn't make any scientific sense out of theexperience--it was not part of the physical universe that I knew. I tried to think about it based on myCatholic beliefs that insisted I could only leave my body if I died. Did I just have a close encounter withdeath? After several hours of trying to make sense out of the experience, I fell asleep without anyanswers.I spent the next day arguing with myself about the experience. My whole belief system was blown topieces. Seeing is believing, and I could not deny that I had experienced the vibrations, the hissing sound,the paralysis and the blue ring of energy. I even \"saw\" through my closed eyelids. I knew I was nothallucinating, I was not insane, I was not dreaming and I was not under hypnosis. My experience wasvery \"real\" to me, as real as my normal waking consciousness, if not more real than that.My first observation was that some kind of nonphysical reality existed. That observation was a directcontradiction of my scientific beliefs because science had been leading me to believe there was no suchthing as a nonphysical reality.Furthermore, I reasoned, Einstein's theory of relativity says that matter is the same as energy. If a personcould consciously leave their body and enter a truly nonphysical world, they wouldn't exactly be\"matter,\" or \"energy\" as we know it. Science left no room for \"consciousness\" or \"spirit\" in theirformulas. Science led me to believe that there were only three basic dimensions of experience (plus time)and five senses. Everything else was labeled superstition, nonsense, hallucination or possibly religion.There is a fact of logic that when a premise is wrong, any conclusions made from that premise are alsowrong. Since I had discovered a premise of science that was wrong, or at the very best incomplete, Ideduced that many or all of the conclusions made by modern science were also wrong. At the very least,they were ignoring some major facts.My own scientific training had led me to distrust science itself! I could no longer trust the textbooks Iloved as a child! Nevertheless, I believe that if a system works, it is okay to use it until you findsomething that works better. I decided that I would still use the scientific method as a tool but nevercompletely trust science again. Meanwhile, the only thing I could do to find peace of mind was to try toinduce more out-of-body experiences and learn more about the nonphysical world.chap04.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap04.html (1 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:16:59 AM]"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"My inner turmoil didn't end with my scientific belief system. I was Catholic. And that caused its owncomplications.The Catholic system taught me to believe in one \"Heaven,\" one \"Hell\" and one Earth. On judgment day,they said, God judges a person to be either \"good\" or \"bad.\" The people labeled \"bad\" go to hell forever,and the people labeled \"good\" go to heaven forever. And of course, until you die, you spend your days onearth.I could guess what the Catholics would say about a nonphysical reality. The liberal Catholics wouldprobably say that I was being absurd, and they had science to back them up. Fundamentalists wouldprobably say that any such experience must surely be the work of the Devil, trying to lead my soul intosin.Still, I refused to believe I was being tricked: Seeing is believing. I had seen that a nonphysical placeexisted and it wasn't \"heaven\" or \"hell.\" Therefore, I had also found a basic premise of Catholicism thatwas wrong. I decided not to trust what the Catholics had taught me because they were just as ignorant ofthis nonphysical world as I had been.I continued going to church for a while, but I started an intense examination of my Catholic beliefs.Hoping to find some answers, I found a Bible that I got as a confirmation gift, and I read the entire NewTestament and much of the Old Testament. The Bible convinced me that Jesus was a good man, andtaught good lessons. In fact, I agreed with everything that Jesus was supposed to have said.But even what I read in the Bible didn't agree with my Catholic belief system! Heavy questions nagged inmy heart. Why does the Catholic church insist that Jesus is the son of God, when Jesus called himself the\"son of man\" repeatedly? Why do they pray, \"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you\" then immediatelythey receive him? Why do they pray for their own petty interests instead of entrusting that God wouldtake care of the world? Why do they preach about needing to fear God? Why do they hold carnivals andbingo games when Jesus said not to use a place of worship in these ways, and even kickedmoneychangers out of a temple? Why, indeed, do they pass a money plate in church? Why do they spendmillions and millions of dollars on grandiose churches-- have you ever seen St. Peters Basilica? --whenpeople are starving? Why do they call the pope, \"our holy father\" when Jesus said not to call anyonefather (Matthew 23:9)? Why do the Catholics go to church and pray in public when Jesus said, \"whenyou pray, go into a room by yourself...in your secret place\" (Matthew 6:5). Why do people go to churchon Sunday and are unspiritual the rest of the week? It seemed wrong that, as a Catholic, going to churchwas my obligation and, once fulfilled, I was free to be as mundane and unspiritual as I wanted. Just oneout-of-body experience blasted that whole hypocritical concept out of the water: During my OBE, I sawthat I was a spiritual being--in fact, I was a spirit--and the thought of dying without some realrelationship with God was scary. Before my OBE, it was enough to recite prayers I didn't evenunderstand. After my OBE, it was clear I needed to do more.Eventually I came to realize that my Catholic belief system was not spiritual at all. The closer I looked,the more I understood. So I stopped going to church and embarked on a truly spiritual path. I don't meanto imply that all Catholics are unspiritual. It's just that I needed to find my own answers.Since my OBE taught me to have a real concern with spiritual matters, I realized that my OBE had taughtme to be more spiritual, not less. I decided that God would not send me to hell for leaving the church andfinding my own spiritual path.chap04.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap04.html (2 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:16:59 AM]"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I resolved to ignore the pain, ignore the fear, ignore the danger, and take my chances with death anddamnation to discover the truth.

Why are there so many visualizations? Why ispretending so important to leaving the body?Well, first let me make myself perfectly clear: OBEs are a lot more than just pretend; they are real.Absolutely real. If you've had one, there will be no doubt in your mind. During the OBE, you are aswide-awake, alert and conscious as you are while reading this. Sometimes more so. All this pretending isjust a stepping-stone to get you out of your body.Before talking about pretending, I'd like to expose another myth. Some occult books say that children canleave their bodies easily but it's harder for most adults. They therefore conclude that as you get older, youbecome more cemented in your physical body. They say the older you get, the harder it is to have OBEs,because we become more focused in our body. Well, that just isn't true. People who say that are using anexcuse to be lazy and not practice.Why, then, don't adults have more OBEs? One reason is that adults don't use their imagination as muchor as vividly as children. That doesn't mean we can't use our imaginations well, it just means that mostpeople don't.There's something magical about the imagination. Children know that intuitively. It's a matter of focus.Children use their imagination to unfocus from their daily lives. They know how to daydream andpretend. That's why children are so psychic! And we can become that psychic--that aware--if we startexercising our playful imaginations too.This exercise isn't just for now, it's an all-day exercise. I want you to make today \"Pretend Day.\" All daytoday, at every available opportunity, I want you to exercise your playful imagination. These littlepretend skits don't have to be long. It's better to be short and frequent, than long and drawn out. I'll giveyou some examples. Go through your day doing these sorts of things:The next time you sit down, just pretend for a few short seconds that you fall through your chair (in yourastral body) and find yourself on the ground or through the floor. The next time you open a door,playfully pretend that your hand passes through the door knob instead of grabbing it. The next time youwalk up a flight of stairs, playfully pretend you glide up it smoothly without walking. Pretend that yourastral body glides up the stairs and patiently waits for your physical body to arrive at the top. The nexttime you look in a mirror, pretend you are looking at your physical body from afar. Pretend you areastral, in as many instances as you can.chap04.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap04.html (3 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:16:59 AM]"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Also, it's good to pretend non-OBE things today.

IfI were somehow able to leave my body, and Monroe can leave his, how many more people are \"outthere,\" and what can they do to me while I was also out there? It also made sense that when a person'sbody dies, they are forced to have a permanent OBE. What could they do to me? Furthermore, whatcould happen to my body while I was out? Could somebody else get inside my body while I was out?These were some questions that crossed my mind during the two months after my first encounter.During those two months I had my first dream about having an OBE. I dreamed I was dreaming. In thesecond level dream, I was telling my brother how I often attempted OBEs, and I showed him how toconcentrate. Then I felt my chest rise. I thought of it rising more and it did. My dream-self then came outof my body, which was in the bed of the first level dream. I started walking toward my door, when I waspulled back inside by my body by the cord. I thought \"Good. Now I can wake up and record that I'vebeen out of my body.\" However, when I woke up I knew it was only a dream. It paled in comparison tomy first episode with the vibrations. Still, having a dream about an OBE was fun and I knew that later Icould compare it to a real OBE. Little did I know that my first real OBE was just around the corner.Although I didn't have another out-of-body experience during those two months, I did run into someunexpected and frightening sensations and experiences. These sensations weren't bad--just startling. Theyoften jarred me out of the near-OBE state and spoiled the whole OBE-attempt. Sometimes it felt as if awarm hand was being placed on my body. I even felt a few pinches on my butt!One night I followed Monroe's procedure to the letter and was making good progress toward leaving mybody. Suddenly I became very aware and alert. My eyes were closed and I was moving deeper into theblackness that I saw ahead of me, into a deeper state of consciousness. Suddenly, I heard an authoritativevoice say, \"STOP!\" How could I argue? I never expected to be hearing voices during these experiments. Ipanicked and did everything I could to force myself back to a normal state.Another night I was trying to blank my mind without much success. After a while, I started to feel aswaying sensation, as if some part of my consciousness was rocking gently. I tried to increase theswaying, but the more I tried, the less I swayed. When I quit trying, the swaying would get strongeragain. The swaying sensation was very much like the \"sea legs\" sensation that sailors experience whenthey've been on a ship too long and try to sleep on shore. After some experimentation I managed tochange the direction of the swaying from side to side instead of up and down. The sensation was strange,but I could see no harm in it. From then on I could create the swaying sensation quite easily once Irelaxed enough during practice.Several times I induced a strange bodily vibration that stemmed from my relaxation technique of tensingand relaxing my entire body. I wondered if this bodily vibration was related to the true OBE vibrations.The answer came one night when I decided to conduct an experiment in which I tried to watch myselffall asleep.I relaxed and just kept going deeper and deeper toward sleep. Suddenly, against my will, I was \"zapped\"chap05.htmhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap05.html (1 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:09 AM]"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"into a state of full awareness. Then I felt a slight tingling. Then the vibrations came without my\"reaching\" for them. This time I noticed that the \"true\" vibrations were a crackling, electrical vibration. Itfelt as if electrical currents were disrupting my body, but not painfully, and not harming it. I tried tostrengthen the vibrations with my mind. I managed to get them a little stronger, but like my firstencounter, I could hear (but not feel) that my heart was pounding wildly. This broke my train of thoughtand the vibrations faded, as if my idle thinking (or worrying) drove them off.One night I got to the point where my mind wouldn't wander. I heard some banging sounds in my roomthat I couldn't explain. Suddenly I heard a louder, more defined bang that seemed to come from theground, about five feet from the bed. I directed my senses in that direction and \"felt\" a big presence there,as if a spirit or ghost of some sort were there. I was afraid, but I tried to control my emotions, and askedin my mind who it was and what its purpose was. There was no answer. I forced myself back to fullconsciousness and looked in that direction. I saw a filmy, undefined movement in that direction. By then,I was so afraid that I purposely started moving parts of my body, to make sure I wouldn't leave my body.I tried my hardest to find a physical, logical explanation for all of this, but was unsuccessful. Naturally, ittook me a while to calm down and dare to shut my eyes to go to sleep.At other times, I started noticing strange tugging sensations during OBE practice. It felt as if someonewere pulling at my clothes or hair during practice. The sensation seemed to have something to do withthe swaying motion. It felt as if something or someone were pulling on whatever was swaying. It waslike my astral body was being tugged while I was still fully in my body.I also started feeling \"pressures\" similar to the tugging sensations. When this happened it seemed as ifheavy weights were placed on various parts of my body: my forehead, my feet, my chest. Sometimes if Ididn't move, these pressures would become painful after a few minutes.With practice I became better at producing the vibrations. I noticed that just before the vibrations came Iwas always \"zapped\" into a state of acute alertness. Sometimes it seemed as if my consciousness wasfocused into an oval disk at my body's face. But every time the vibrations would come, my heart wouldstart pounding, I would panic, and the vibrations would slowly fade until I was back to normal. When Iopened my eyes, they were cloudy but slowly cleared up. My body felt very heavy and stiff. My handswere stiff and hard to open. Sometimes I was also slightly dizzy after the experience.I started noticing another strange sensation while trying to leave my body: a ringing noise in my ears. Iquickly learned to reproduce the ringing, but it never got me anywhere so I learned to ignore it.Another thing I've experienced during practice is sudden falling sensations. I would be quietly attemptingOBE, and suddenly it would feel as if a trap door had sprung open, and I would panic-fall about threefeet. After three feet, I would be startled back to full consciousness with a slight jump, as if my astralbody was slapped back into the physical body. This had a simple variation that was more common:sometimes it seemed as if my consciousness was thrown three to five feet forward or backward.Sometimes I heard very loud rushing or roaring noises in my head. Usually when this happened, I alsofelt as if my consciousness was being crushed in on all sides. It's as if the very boundaries of myawareness were forced down to a tiny infinitesimal pinpoint in the center of my head.A friend of mine told me of a few jarring sensations that sometimes disturb her just before OBEs. Thefirst sensation she described as feeling like her heart was \"pulling apart\" or expanding. The secondsensation is loss of breath, as if the astral body does not breathe and she loses all awareness of bodilychap05.htmhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap05.html (2 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:09 AM]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"breathing. She also says that her whole field of vision sometimes shrinks suddenly, like a camera shutter.Trying to ignore these sensations is like trying to ignore a slap in the face. I discovered that the best thingto do was to acknowledge them, but remain passive and not let them startle me and ruin the OBEattempt. When I finally learned to get through these sensations calmly, they started leading me toconscious astral projection!There was a good outcome of all the frightening experiences: they helped me get over my fear. I wasforced to face my fears and conquer them one by one, especially my fear of the unknown.EXERCISE 5Daily VisualizationsMuch of the occult literature concerning out-of-body experiences claims that we leave our bodies everynight during sleep, but we usually are not conscious during these nightly excursions. Usually the OBEonly happens after our consciousness has been disabled. But sometimes something goes wrong with theprocess and a piece of our conscious self retains awareness during the separation. At those times, weoften \"wake up\" abruptly with a jolt before we are fully asleep.One of the \"tricks\" to having out-of-body experiences is getting your subconscious mind to wake you upafter you are out of your body. Quite simply, if you can influence your subconscious mind to reinstateyour conscious awareness once the process of separation is complete, you will have fully consciousOBEs.There are several approaches to influencing the subconscious mind. In previous exercises, we usedaffirmations and prayers to influence the subconscious mind (and influence other things as well.)Hypnosis is another excellent approach. Early studies in hypnosis showed a lot of promise in inducingOBEs. Unfortunately, there have been very few experiments in this area to the best of my knowledge,and the literature is scarce.There are several audio hypnosis tapes available for inducing OBEs. I'm fairly resistant to hypnosis, so Ihaven't had any results using these tapes; The closest I've experienced was remote viewing which, Ithink, isn't nearly as fun as astral projection.Another way to influence the subconscious is through concentrated visualizations, done frequentlythroughout the day. Any visualization that is OBE-related is good. Here are a few I use:Visualize yourself flying over valleys, seas, planes.1. Visualize yourself shooting out away from your body.2. Visualize yourself floating.3. Sit down and visualize that you take a step back and stand up so that you are looking down at theback of your head. Then think to yourself, \"That's not me. That's just a shell.\"4. Practice holding onto visualizations as long as you can. See how \"real\" you can make the visualization.These skills are very valuable for learning OBEs.chap05.htmhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap05.html (3 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:09 AM]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In some exercises for other chapters, I will be giving visualizations for inducing out-of-body experiences.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap05.htmhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap05.html (4 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:09 AM]"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6My First Out-of-Body ExperienceThe morning of November 1, 1979, started out normal. I woke up around 7:00am, did my usual morningroutine and caught a bus to the University of Minnesota. I got to the University at 9:00am, walked intomy favorite computer lab and started programming. I worked furiously on a microcomputer game forseveral hours until it was time for my Thursday class. I hurried off to class, took copious notes duringclass, then hurried back to the computer lab.This time I logged into the University's timesharing computer and started working on another game Iwrote. A hockey game was playing on a radio in the back of the lab. I worked on that computer gameuntil 10:00pm that night. After twelve hours of intense programming I started getting tired and hungry. Ihadn't eaten since breakfast. I signed off the computer and caught the next bus home.When I got home at 10:30pm, I was hungry. I looked in the refrigerator and found a big pan of lasagna.My mom must have made me a big lasagna dinner and I missed it by staying late at the University! I tookout a big slice of lasagna, heated it and wolfed it down. Ordinarily I would have made my usual attemptto leave my body, but that night I was just too tired. I went to bed at 11:30pm and was asleep the minutemy head hit the pillow.I fell into a deep sleep and started dreaming a programmer's most hated and feared dream: theprogramming dream. The same dream plagued me for hours: I was sitting at a computer terminal, askingmyself, \"How can I make this program better?\"I put up with that dream for four annoying hours. That was all I could stand. I became so annoyed by thisdream that I couldn't take any more. Slowly I turned my attention away from the dream. I slowly forcedmyself to become conscious, but as I did, I noticed the dream was still going on! Somehow I was awakeand asleep at the same time!What happened next is hard to describe. My consciousness was split into five parts. Each part wasseparate and unique, yet I was each of them simultaneously. Each was thinking its own thoughts, andcommunicating with the other four. All five of \"me\" were arguing about the computer game and how tomake it better!The feeling was beyond words: I was five personalities at the same time and I was talking to myself! Oneof my five selves asked, \"Well, how can we make the spacewar game better?\" Another \"me\" said, \"Well,I think we should allow more interactive communication between space ships.\" Yet another \"me\" replied,\"No, I think it's more important to improve the fighting ability of the computer-controlled opponentships.\" One of my five selves was bored to tears watching this whole conversation and tried to force itselfto consciousness. Now that \"I\" was conscious, I was fascinated at what was happening: I was consciousand split into five parts and each of them were taking turns talking.At first I tried to follow the conversation, but something strange started happening. As I became moreconscious, my four other selves seemed to speed up! I tried to keep up with the conversation, but thetalking became faster and faster. Soon they sounded like a tape player in fast-forward mode, and I lostchap06.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap06.html (1 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:22 AM]"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"track of what they were saying. Meanwhile, the voices faded into the distance and seemed to disappear.My consciousness was no longer split. I was completely awake and aware of my surroundings, but Iknew something was not normal. My body felt unusual. It felt odd to be conscious and yet still asleep.Just then, I got a strange feeling all over, like a shiver over my whole body. I listened to see if I couldhear what caused the strange feeling. I heard what sounded like a hockey announcer in the background! Ithought, \"Now that's odd. Where could that be coming from?\" I wondered if the sound could be comingfrom the bathroom where we kept a small radio. It sounded a little bit too loud for that; the radio had tobe closer to my bedroom.I wondered if a radio was playing in our dining room, which was next to my bedroom. That didn't makesense because there weren't any radios in that room. Besides, the radio seemed a bit too loud for that, too.I figured the radio must be in my bedroom somewhere.I thought for a moment that my little alarm clock/radio might have turned on in the night, but it seemedtoo loud even for that. It was loud enough to be my stereo, but I remembered turning it off before goingto bed. Besides, when I listened closer, the hockey announcer sounded even closer than my stereo.As I listened, the sound of the hockey announcer's voice grew louder and louder as if someone wereturning up the volume steadily. I started to worry as the sound became louder and louder, until finally myears were hurting and I was ready to scream with the pain.Suddenly it stopped and I experienced complete and total silence. Another strange feeling came over me:I felt like I was completely separate from my body, although I was still occupying the same space. Idecided to try to get out.I had read a few OBE books by then. Some of them had good techniques to separate the consciousnessfrom the body, but none of them said what to do next! How could I get away from the body I was layingin? Since I was in my astral body, gravity didn't affect me, so I didn't just \"fall\" out of the body. Myastral body could pass right through physical matter, so I didn't think I could grab onto anything to pullmyself out. I didn't think I could push my way out either; what could I push against?I thought about the problem for a few minutes. Then I examined my physical body and noticed that itseemed solid on the outside edges. The edges looked like a barrier of gray. My physical body seemedlike a bottle; it was solid on the outside, but hollow on the inside. I was like the liquid inside the bottle,fluid and elastic, but there was no way out of the bottle!At first I tried to twist myself inside the physical body so I could climb out the stomach. I wiggled myastral arms out of the physical arms, like taking off a tight sweater. Then I squirmed until I was under therib-cage. I reached my astral arms up, and tried to claw my way through the stomach. I clawed andclawed, but some barrier, some force-field, was holding me back. The harder I struggled against thebarrier, the more impossible it seemed to move. I managed to inch my way for a little while but gave upand lay down again.I decided to try another way out. I lifted my legs over my head, and did a backward somersault over myhead and out of my body.I felt free and weightless. I wanted to float slowly up to the ceiling. With that thought, I started to floatgently up. Then I looked up and thought about my destination, the top of the ceiling. Suddenly, Ichap06.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap06.html (2 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:22 AM]"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"whooshed up to the ceiling. I looked around the room with a sense of delight.I looked straight down at my body. It was under the bed covers, but from what I could see it looked likeit had just collapsed and was out cold. I thought, \"Gee, what if I fall from up here?\" As soon as thethought crossed my mind, I came crashing down into my physical body and rejoined. I went right into ashort, dreamless sleep. In a minute or two I woke up in my physical body. Being a skeptic, I askedmyself, \"Was that a hallucination? Did I dream it all?\" No way. It was real beyond my wildestexpectations of real.I rolled over and looked at the time. It was 3:45am in the morning.I recalled the whole incident three or four times in my mind, so I wouldn't forget to write down any of thedetails later. During the experience I was perfectly cool, calm and collected. That is, until I crashed intomy body. Now that I was safely in my body I felt the full realization of what had happened: I had literallybeen outside my body. The more I thought about it, the more scary it seemed. My heart was stillpounding with excitement. However, I was more tired than I was afraid, so I managed to calm myselfdown enough to drift back to sleep.The next thing I knew, the computer conversation dream started again! This time I realized right awaywhat was happening and I was immediately \"zapped\" out of my physical body again. Like before, I wasseparate from my body, but still laying inside it. I was too cautious to get up and walk around outside mybody, but I didn't want to waste the opportunity to explore. I decided to do some experiments while stilllaying inside my body.The first experiment was a simple one: I wanted to see if I could lift my astral arms and look at them. If Icould see them, what would they look like?I bent my astral arms at the elbow and looked at the arms. They looked and felt perfectly normal andnatural. They seemed so normal that after shaking them a few times I convinced myself I was back insidemy body! I thought, \"There's nothing unusual about this; I'm perfectly fine. I'm not out of my body--howsilly of me.\" I tried to lower my arms, but I couldn't! It seemed as if held in some kind of force-field! Ipushed and pushed, trying to force my arms down to their normal position, but the harder I tried the moreresistance I felt: I could only move them two inches in a circle at best. Then I really panicked! I drew upas much strength as I could to use it against the force-field. With all the energy I could muster, Iforcefully slammed my arms back into place.I blacked out for a second and went back to full body consciousness. Again I asked myself, \"Was itreal?\" It was so real that I convinced myself I was inside my body! Why did my arms get stuck? I'm notsure. Perhaps I was so sure I was in the physical body that I became part physical and part astral, and myarms were held in limbo.As I thought about the experience over and over, I wondered, \"Why don't the OBE books mentionanything about this?\"My first two out-of-body experiences were achieved by becoming conscious during a dream. This isknown in today's literature as Lucid Dreaming. This method of leaving the body was documented in theearly 1900s in books and articles by Oliver Fox (a pen name for Hugh Calloway) and Yram (a pen namefor Marcel Louis Forhan). I hadn't read those books until after my first experiences. At that point Ithought the only way to have an OBE was through conscious effort.

In The Projection of theAstral Body, Muldoon and Carrington wrote:Yes, you are using your astral body even now; it is tuned down, we might say, to harmonizewith the vibrations common to material substance. Now there are factors which hold itdown, and there are factors which tune it up. The powers which can be exerted todisharmonize the attunement are the powers which will cause the astral to move out of thephysical. (Pg. 48)If this is true, your soul is vibrating a few orders of magnitude higher than your body, but the two are insync. It is as if you and your body are experiencing the same musical note, but in different octaves. Thisexercise will help you to raise your vibrations.The exercise is as follows: Lay down, close your eyes, and relax completely. Imagine that you areseparate from the body, and laying inside the body-shell. Imagine that your physical body is vibratingslowly, and your astral body is vibrating at a faster rate. Pretend you can both hear and feel the vibrationsthroughout your astral body as if you were standing in front of nine-foot speakers.Next, imagine the vibration of the astral body increases in pitch gradually, getting higher and higher. Asthe pitch gets higher, the two notes go out of sync and a certain resonance gets stronger and stronger.Repeat this exercise several times. This simple exercise can actually produce the vibrations which canseparate you from your body.

Up to now,occasional psychic experiences were like party noises; I did my best to ignore them. Dabbling withaltered states of consciousness was like walking upstairs and putting my ear up to the door. The pokesand prods were like party noises I heard from outside. My first OBE was like opening the door andwalking into the party. What happened next was like going in, getting drunk and inviting everyone backto my place!The day was November 26, 1979. Twenty-four days had passed since my first two out-of-bodyexperiences of November 2. It had been two and one half months since I started exploring altered statesof consciousness, trying to learn about the OBE. My playing with altered states had shaken me up quite abit because of the pokes, prods, sounds and sensations I hadn't expected. My first OBE shook me up evenmore; It was undeniably real and made the pokes and prods seem trivial in comparison. Little did I knowthat my dabbling had opened some kind of psychic door.I was living at home, while attending classes at the University and working part-time. That day, my momhad a friendly, nonalcoholic birthday party, and JP and I started talking about OBEs. He asked me to trya quick experiment: he held up his right index finger about an inch away from the space between myeyes, and he asked me if I felt anything. I felt a strange sensation there, as if part of my astral body wasbeing pulled out of my forehead. I tried to explain what I felt, and asked him what it was. He said hedidn't know for sure, but the space between his eyes worked the same for him. I hadn't read anythingabout the \"third eye\" yet, so I didn't pursue the matter.After the party, I went to bed and made my nightly attempt to induce an out-of-body experience. After afew minutes of practice I opened my eyes and saw movements and lights in midair! I was frightened, andto make matters worse I started drifting away from my body! I panicked and tried my hardest to stay inmy body! Once I was securely in my body I closed my eyes and decided not to continue. I eventuallymanaged to fall asleep, but much later than normal.The next morning I woke up tired with the alarm clock. I had to get up early to go to my 8:00am class atthe University. I realized I was too tired to pay attention at class, so I decided to get some caffeine in mysystem to help wake up. Since I hated the taste of coffee, I went to the refrigerator and grabbed a bottleof soda pop, opened it up and sat down at the breakfast table. I took a sip and sat there trying to wake upand get motivated. Without warning I felt the bottle accidentally slip out of my hand and my hand closedinto a fist. I was startled and expected to hear a loud crash as the bottle hit the floor, but there was nosound. I quickly looked at my hand, and the bottle was still there, securely in my hand! It wasn'tpsychokinesis; My astral hand had accidentally \"let go\" of my physical hand, but the physical hand heldtightly onto the bottle. I knew right then it was going to be a strange day.I caught my usual bus to the University and went to my usual classes. My last class got out at noon, and Ineeded to be at an important meeting at work by 1:00pm. I debated whether to stop for lunch. Somethingdeep down inside me said, \"It's okay, you have enough time.\" The thoughts seemed to be my own, andyet separate from me, like a deeper source of knowledge. I dismissed it; \"That's just my stomach voicingchap07.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap07.html (1 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:35 AM]"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"its hunger.\"I walked over to a local sit-down restaurant. I looked at the menu. Their specialty burger looked great,but it was served with a small portion of potato chips. I was very hungry for french fries, but short oncash, so I ordered the burger \"as is.\" After the waitress left I thought to myself, \"I have enough moneyand I'm hungry; I should have ordered the fries. I really want the fries.\" I didn't want to bother thewaitress by changing my order, so I didn't say anything.A few minutes later, the waitress brought my burger with a large serving of french fries! \"Somethingstrange is happening here,\" I thought, \"This is getting weird.\" Was it a psychic experience? \"No,\" Ithought, \"It was just a coincidence.\"When I was almost done with my lunch, that same \"something\" deep down inside me said, \"You betterhurry or you'll miss your bus for St. Paul and miss your meeting.\" Again I dismissed it, thinking, \"That'sjust me, worrying about being late for the meeting.\" Nevertheless, I rushed to the end of my meal andpaid my bill. I wasn't charged for the fries.I ran across the street to the bus stop and my bus was just pulling up. How convenient! I got on the busand looked at my watch. It was 12:15pm. The trip from Minneapolis to St. Paul usually takes 45 minutes,so I felt confident I would not be late for the meeting. Then it occurred to me: If I hadn't rushed throughmy lunch, I would have missed that bus, and I would have been late for my meeting. Was it a psychicexperience? \"No,\" I thought, \"It was just a coincidence.\"I wasn't late for the meeting, but the meeting kept me from working on an important project, so I decidedto work late. I worked that night until 9:40pm, then I went to catch my bus back to Minneapolis. By\"coincidence\" a bus pulled up almost as soon as I got to the bus stop. I got on the bus and sat down. Ineeded to catch another bus in downtown Minneapolis, so I got out my bus schedule and looked up whenthe other bus would be at my Minneapolis bus stop. The bus slowly pulled away from the bus stop andstarted sluggishly lumbering down the street at 15 miles per hour. My other bus was due to arrivedowntown at 10:15pm and the next bus after that was 11:40pm. The driver kept driving at 15 miles perhour, for the next five city blocks.Since it was 9:45pm, I only had 30 minutes to get to Minneapolis to catch my 10:15pm bus, and it wasusually a 45 minute bus ride. To make matters worse, the bus driver was driving 15 miles per hour! Istarted to get very discouraged. I was brooding. I thought to myself, \"I wish there were some way I couldmake this bus driver understand that I need to be in Minneapolis by 10:15pm.\" One block later the buspulled up to the next stop and another passenger got on board.Then something strange happened. The bus pulled away from the bus stop like a bat out of hell! The buskept accelerating until he was ten miles-per-hour over the speed limit! He drove to Minneapolis atbreakneck speeds--speeding the whole way--and passing up half of his bus stops! He even ran through ared light! He pulled up to my Minneapolis bus stop at 10:10pm. That was twenty-five minutes; a newworld's record! I got off the bus and it tore off into the distance. \"Wow!\" I thought, \"That's incredible!\"As I patiently waited for my 10:15pm bus home, I thought to myself again, \"Was it a psychicexperience?\" How many coincidences can pile up before you believe that something extraordinary ishappening to you? If someone off the street, or even a respected scientist, were to tell me of a series ofpsychic experiences like that, I would have laughed in his face. But since they were happening to me, Icouldn't laugh. \"All right,\" I admitted to myself, \"things like that don't just happen 'by coincidence.'chap07.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap07.html (2 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:35 AM]"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"That's an excuse I've been using too long.\"I had asked for Out-of-Body Experiences, not psychic experiences. Somehow I had got them both.Somehow I was becoming psychic, whether I wanted it or not. I absolutely loved the psychic things thatwere starting to happen, but I started to worry about my sanity: What's next--delusions of grandeur?Psychotic behavior? Paranoia? Just how important are my thoughts anyway? Can this power be abused?\"Should I tell anyone what is happening to me?\" I asked myself. \"If the experiences were not mine, Iwould never have believed them in a million years. So how can I expect anyone to believe they happenedto me? No way!\" I vowed not to tell anyone.As a skeptic, I didn't want to believe in psychic experiences. I thought it was all a load of rubbish. But inthe years ahead, as I kept practicing OBEs, I also kept having psychic experiences. Most days I wouldhave three to five experiences I would classify as \"psychic.\" They happened so often that I couldn't denythey were real.I doubt that the psychic experiences were directly related to the out-of-body experiences. Rather, I thinkthey were more related to the practice, during which I would induce altered states of consciousness. Idiscovered that when I became too wrapped up in daily life, I would have fewer psychic experiences.And if I took the time to meditate and explore altered states of consciousness, I would have more psychicexperiences.I was disappointed in the many OBE books that never mentioned the connection between OBE practiceand psychic experiences. People brave enough to try to induce OBEs should be aware of the connection:When you try for OBEs, you may get more than you expect! Some of these psychic experiences can bealarming, unnerving, and sometimes even scary.EXERCISE 7Hypnogogic PlaySleep is a very complex thing. Each sleep cycle has several stages including the dream stage, or RapidEye Movement (REM) sleep. Most of my out-of-body experiences occur during the hypnogogic andhypnopompic states. The hypnogogic state occurs at the beginning of the sleep cycle when we're juststarting to fall asleep. During this state, your conscious mind is normally \"letting go\" and yoursubconscious mind is taking over. The hypnopompic state is similar, but it occurs when you are wakingup naturally (not awaken by an alarm clock).It's very easy to recognize these states of consciousness: In both states, it is normal and natural to seemixed-up visual images, and to hear voices. Usually the voices and images don't make any sense.For this exercise, I want you to experiment with these states of consciousness. Learn to recognize thesehypnogogic images and watch them or listen to them with interest, instead of falling deeper into sleep.Just \"play\" with these natural altered states to get a feel for this type of experimentation with the\"borderland\" of consciousness. This kind of play is fun, and can induce OBEs. Since we typically havefive or more sleep cycles per night, we have at least ten opportunities to have OBEs every night! That'schap07.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap07.html (3 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:35 AM]"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"seventy opportunities for an OBE every week, in addition to your normal practice sessions!As an experiment, try to stay awake or prolong consciousness while you're falling asleep. Try to \"walk\"the thin line between conscious and unconscious. Try to get closer and closer to sleep while holding ontoa thread of consciousness. Learn to hang onto that borderland state for long periods: This is a useful skillin learning OBEs.Late one night I was using a computerized \"TALK\" program, talking to other programmers. I asked oneguy what he was doing up so late. He said always had problems sleeping for as long as he couldremember. He had a bad case of insomnia and hadn't slept for days. I told him I could cure his insomnia,and he said he didn't believe me, but he'd be forever grateful if I could. Well, I started telling him aboutmy astral escapades, and I ended up giving him about five OBE-techniques to try. Several weeks wentby. The next time I ran into him (on the same TALK program) he said, \"It worked! You cured myinsomnia! With your techniques, I fell right asleep! I haven't had any problem sleeping since!\"The point is, it's easy to fall asleep during OBE-practice. The best way to keep from falling asleep is torouse yourself as soon as you recognize the first signs of sleep. In this way, you can learn to hold ontoconsciousness without drifting off to sleep.Another technique is to lie down and try to fall asleep with your arm held up in the air, bent at the elbow.When you start to fall asleep, your muscles will relax and your arm will drop, waking you up again. Thisway, you can learn to get very close to sleep without being overcome by it. Later, you can stop holdingup your arm during practice and get even closer to sleep and remain conscious.These exercises have another benefit. By doing this, you are learning to unite the conscious with thesubconscious. You are learning to keep yourself conscious during the times when your subconscious isusually in control. And when that happens, your conscious can talk directly to your subconscious withoutinterference. Then magical things will start to happen. Your subconscious will cooperate with yourconscious. Your left brain will cooperate with your right brain. Your creative mind will cooperate withyour analytical mind. All areas of your life will improve.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap07.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap07.html (4 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:17:35 AM]"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8Overcoming FearClearly as long as I continued to try OBEs, strange and frightening things would happen to me. Aftersome serious consideration I decided that I had been playing with fire. This OBE business was just tooscary and dangerous. What was it doing to my body? What was it doing to my mind? Was I becomingprone to outside forces, such as spirits? I had begun to worry about my sanity and started to wonder if Iwere some kind of freak. I decided to quit trying to have OBEs and try to go back to a normal life.The next two weeks I didn't attempt any altered states of consciousness. I tried my best to go back to mynormal life. But although I wasn't trying, weird things still happened to me. I started reading people'sminds. I started to \"know\" what song would be on the radio next. As I was trying to fall asleep at night, Iwould still feel the same weird sensations: Swaying, pokes and prods, the whole gambit. It was evenmore alarming because I wasn't even trying to make them happen.I came to some important conclusions: First, there was no turning back--I couldn't just turn it off.Second, the best way I could deal with these weird experiences was to explore them and try tounderstand them. I needed to learn how to control them and learn how to control my fear of them.My first step was to confront my fears. As long as I feared these experiences, they had control over me.If I could eliminate the fear, the experiences would no longer have that power over me. I could be incontrol of myself and the experiences.The first step was to organize my thoughts. I listed all the reasons why I wanted to have moreout-of-body experiences and why I should not be afraid of them. The list looked like this:I wanted to have more OBEs. After the first two experiences I couldn't turn away and forget it. Itried that and it didn't work. Besides, my curiosity still motivated me to go on.1. I reasoned that some day, when I die, I will be forced out of my body, and I'll have to deal with theissue then. It seems better to learn the rules before I die, so I can handle it better when my time isup. If I explore the out-of-body state while still alive, perhaps my transition to the waiting worldwill be smoother. When I die, I will be cast into a strange new world, just as an infant is cast intoour world. Imagine how wonderful it would be if a fetus could attend some kind of school while itwas still in the womb! Imagine a baby that can talk on the day it was born!2. When people die, they are all cast out of their bodies. It is our inevitable, inescapable fate. Sincebillions of people have died since the beginning of time, this new world must be quite safe forhuman \"existence\" and not as frightening as I thought.3. I had been out of my body twice and nothing terrible had happened to me: I hadn't felt any pain, Ihadn't been attacked, and there weren't any demons waiting to possess my body. During the firstexperience, I was gently floating in the air. I felt completely safe at the time. My fear of theunknown is what stopped both OBEs.4. I had recently read several OBE books, many of which had hundreds of OBE narratives. In almostall cases, people described the OBE as beautiful, painless, and even ecstatic. Many people whoexperienced \"near-death experiences\" (NDEs) didn't want to get back in their bodies. They were5. chap08.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap08.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:17:49 AM]"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"perfectly happy and content to stay out forever!Despite my distrust of the Catholic religion, I still held some beliefs, like a belief in God. I figuredthat if I were a good person, God wouldn't let anything bad happen to me while I was out of mybody. \"After all,\" I thought, \"I'm dealing with God's kingdom.\"6. The OBE books I read claimed the body is equipped with safeguards to pull me back into my bodyif things got too rough. The books said that many simple things would automatically bring meback to my body, such as poor blood circulation, fear, and thoughts of the physical body.7. I believed (and still believe) in \"guardian angels\" who help me in times of trouble or need.8. I also read that if I got into serious trouble, I would faint and my subconscious would take over,bringing me back to safety.9. I read over my list and confronted my fears directly. I became determined to learn to face and control myout-of-body experiences and their side effects, even if it meant death. That night I wrote a note in myjournal, explaining what I was doing and how I felt about death. I made my apologies in case I diedduring practice.Once I faced and conquered my fears, I started attempting OBEs again. This time I took a more seriousapproach. I developed a simple training schedule: Every Saturday and Sunday morning I would layaround in bed for several hours, trying to leave my body. I was no longer just dabbling with altered statesof consciousness; I was on a mission. I was an explorer, determined to discover my own truths.With practice, I got better at reproducing the conditions necessary to induce the vibrations. I learned toremain calm during my attempts and I found out that staying calm is very important because it helps toprolong the experience.I eventually learned that fear wears off over time. After you confront the unknown a hundred times, it'sno longer as frightening. Conquering my fears was a big step in my spiritual development and it mademe a much happier person in daily life. It gave a whole new meaning to the famous quote from The Bible(Psalms 23:4): \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.\"EXERCISE 8Resolving FearsHowever frightening OBE-practice might be, the actual OBEs themselves aren't frightening. They areusually very peaceful and happy--not frightening at all. OBEs are only frightening to people who don'tunderstand what's going on. Mostly it is fear of the unknown. Being put into unfamiliar surroundingswith new laws, can be terrifying to anyone. But you don't have to be afraid of OBEs if you understandthe rules. Rule #1: Your beliefs create your experience. Rule #2: Attitude makes all the difference. If yougo into the experience with negative thoughts, your OBE is likely to be unpleasant. If you go into theexperience with positive thoughts, your OBE is likely to be wonderful. Rule #3: Your body cannot bepossessed by a spirit while you are away. I'll say more about that in chapter 26. Rule #4: There is no suchthing as a \"demon.\" I'll say more about that, also in chapter 26. Rule #5: You cannot get lost or lose yourbody. Rule #6: The only thing you have to fear is fear itself.chap08.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap08.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:17:49 AM]"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The exercise for this chapter is as follows: Write down a list of each desire, belief, fear and expectationyou can think of. Of course, if you have a problem with writing, just running through it in your head willhelp.First, write down your desires. Do you want to leave your body? Do you want to see higher truths? Whatdo you want from this and other experiences?Second, write down your beliefs about the out-of-body experience. Do you believe it is wrong? Do youbelieve it is a trick of the devil? Do you believe it is merely a dream? Do you believe there are demons orspirits out there to harm you? Do you believe hell and heaven are somewhere out there? Do you believethat demons or spirits can take over your body while you are out? Do you believe that the OBE is a sin inthe eyes of God?Third, write down your fears. Are you afraid of getting lost while out of your body? Are you afraid ofspirits? Are you afraid of possession? Are you afraid of flying? Are you afraid of heights?Fourth, write down your expectations. Do you expect to meet angels or spirits? Do you expect to meetother astral travelers? Do you expect to be weightless? Do expect to be wearing clothes?Fifth, go through your lists and mark each item you don't \"like.\" For instance, if you believe demons cantake over your body while you are out, mark that item. When you are done marking your \"negative\"items, go through each of them and confront them in your own mind. Don't attempt to have an OBE untilyour negative items are conquered or at least under control. Once you have conquered your negativefeelings toward the OBE, your worries are over. If you still believe in demons, you might just meet one.If you don't believe in demons, none can bother you. But until you resolve these fears, your experiencesmay be influenced by them.Examining and conquering beliefs isn't easy. I don't know of anyone who is completely free of negativebeliefs.

My third and fourth OBE wereself-induced, not sporadic. They were also short and uneventful.Up to then, I thought there were only two ways to leave your body: Through lucid dreams like my firsttwo, or through practice like my third and fourth. It wasn't long before I discovered there were otherways.01/01/80 - OBE #5...I was dreaming that I was camping along a riverside with a group of people. We thoughtwe were safe, but suddenly two vampires--one male, one female--attacked our camp, andthe dream turned into a nightmare.I fought the female vampire for a long time and I finally killed her. I was exhausted.Much to my horror, the other vampire came running and attacked me. We fought long andhard, but I was weak from my fight with the female vampire. He finally overpowered meand started sucking the blood out of me. I became weaker and realized I couldn't fightanymore. I was dying in my dream! I actually believed I was dying.Then I woke up startled, and opened my eyes. I immediately saw a hand grasping for mythroat! I was fully conscious, inside my body, and it seemed as if someone was trying to killme!I reenacted the dream-battle in my head for a few seconds, thought I was dying again, and Iwas ejected out of my body like bread out of a toaster!I sat up and turned to look who was attacking my poor body. The hand that was reaching formy throat was my own! It was loosely draped over the pillow! I sighed a breath of relief. Iwasn't in danger after all. I had literally been scared to death!I was glued to my body, but this time instead of trying to free myself I tried to control myastral self with my mind. I thought hard, \"I want to go to [my brother's house]\" but nothinghappened. Instead, I heard my physical voice (kind of muffled) saying it in the background!I looked at my astral hands. They were gently waving back and forth....I was drawn closer tothe physical body and I dropped inside and immediately opened my eyes (no blackout). Isaw my hand draped over the pillow, as if it was reaching for my throat, exactly as I saw itduring the OBE.We've all heard the term, \"scared to death,\" right? Well, this OBE sheds new light on the term. Perhaps itshows there is no such thing as being \"scared to death\" because the worst that can happen is that you'rescared out of your body. Perhaps it means we can only die when we are ready to die. I like to think thatour deaths are planned by our higher self, and there are no accidents.chap09.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap09.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:17:59 AM]"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"In later OBEs, I discovered yet another way to leave my body. This one took me by surprise too:05/23/80 Fri - OBE #16I went to my math class. When class started at 12:15pm, something strange happened to me.I was sitting, and suddenly I became completely disoriented, and couldn't feel my body. Itseemed as if I fell out of my body, and drifted to my left (west)! Then I came back and wasdisoriented and very dizzy. My dizziness wore off in seconds.Since that OBE, I've had similar experiences in which I fell out of my body. Once I tripped and fell outwhile I was walking down the street! When I came back to my body, it was fine and it hadn't missed astep.The strange thing about this type of OBE is that it happens without warning, from full consciousness. Iwas in excellent health each time and not on any medications. I wasn't tired during the experiences, andmy body wasn't very relaxed, at least not to the extent that I normally induce the vibrations. Perhapswe're not as body-bound as we think we are!Some researchers have gone as far as to suggest that we aren't even \"in\" a body at all. Perhaps ourphysical body is just a focus for our consciousness, and when we learn how to change our focus we canleave the body at will.EXERCISE 9Yoyo VisualizationThis exercises uses imagination to create an astral swaying motion. Once created, you can latch onto theswaying and it will pull you away from your body. I've used this method to leave my body several times.The exercise is this: lay down, relax completely and put yourself into a receptive mood. Next, imaginethat there is a yoyo in front of you at eye level. Imagine the yoyo string is attached to the area betweenyour eyes. The yoyo is weightless, so it doesn't fall with gravity. A real yoyo needs a pushing and pullingaction from your hand, but this imaginary yoyo needs pushing and pulling from your third eye. Withyour imagination, push the yoyo down to the end of its string then pull it back to your third eye. As youwork with the yoyo, try to work your way into a single- minded, focused state of mind.With your mind, push and pull the yoyo about fifty times. Try to do this until your visualization is so realthat you can actually see the yoyo in front of you. Don't try to count the number of pushes you give,because that may unfocus your mind and bring you out of the single-minded focus.You may think it sounds silly, but it's one of the most successful techniques I've ever developed. If youcan't visualize it clearly today, keep working on it every day until you can. When you are trying to leaveyour body there are very important key points to keep in mind, and one of them is realism. If you canvisualize the yoyo with absolute realism, out-of-body experiences are a short step away.chap09.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap09.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:17:59 AM]"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap09.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap09.html (3 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:17:59 AM]"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10The Small Still Voice WithinOne cold day in early 1980, I was waiting at a bus stop. At that time, I had about a dozen OBEs to mycredit. I thought about my favorite television show, \"Kung Fu,\" which always had tidbits of wisdomsprinkled throughout the show. The Shaolin masters in the show were always portrayed as kind andhumble, but above all wise. I wished I could be wise like that. Then I remembered a story in the Bibleabout Solomon (1 Kings, 3: 5-13). In the story, God offered to give Solomon anything and Solomonchose the gift of wisdom. Solomon was rewarded well for his choice. I wondered what it would be like ifI were wise: \"If I were wise,\" I thought to myself, \"I could probably think up any question and lookinside and find a truly wise answer there.\"If I were a wise man and someone asked me questions, what would I say? I started to fantasize, askingmyself philosophical questions and making up answers, pretending I was wise. Suppose they asked,\"What is love?\" I paused to think. I'd say, \"Love is the binding force of the Universe.\" If they asked\"Who am I?\" I would answer, \"You are a spark of God's divine Light.\"My bus wasn't there, so I continued with this daydream. I asked myself more questions. Each time I'dlook deeper into myself for the answer. After a few times I was surprised at the answers I came up with;the answers didn't seem like me at all! At the time, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, so I didn't evenwrite about it in my journal.This \"wisdom\" game was a lot of fun, so the next few days I practiced whenever I had free time. Insteadof asking specific questions, I started asking myself to \"Say something wise.\" This also gave meunexpected results, such as:Perfect love is never selfish. It's wrong not to love at all. It is better to love someone andselfishly desire their love. It is still better to love someone, and desire to give them yourlove, asking nothing in return. It is best to love All That Is unselfishly, and recognizeeverything as a part of that creation, including your loved one and yourself.Upon closer examination, I didn't exactly make up \"words\" in my head when I asked myself questions. Igot a jumble of thoughts, feelings, words, sounds and images, and I \"translated\" this jumble into words.Then I said the translated words to myself, and somehow they made sense. Later, this translation processbecame so automatic that it was just like \"talking.\"I had learned to ask myself questions, and come up with answers, but I was very skeptical about it. Itseemed as if I were pretty much \"making up\" the answers I wanted, even if the answers often had a lotmore \"insight\" than I thought I had. The answers just came to me from the top of my head. They onlycame when I asked, and often they were the first things that entered my mind after I formulated thequestion. For that reason, I viewed this all as a \"game\" I was playing, never taking it seriously.Then the inner source of wisdom started to develop a personality of its own. Very gradually I startednoticing that I was sometimes getting \"answers\" without asking questions. I started getting advice andreminders from within, which would come out of the blue.chap10.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap10.html (1 of 6) [5/4/1999 9:18:11 AM]"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"I noticed that the answers addressed me in the second person; instead of receiving the message, \"I shouldpark over there\" I would receive the message, \"You should park over there, Bob.\" Also, the answersstarted getting more specific. Messages like, \"You should park over there\" became \"You should parkover there, because there's more time on that parking meter than this one.\" Later, these things turned outto be true. At first I thought I might be going crazy. Crazy people heard voices. But as I said before, Iwasn't really hearing voices; I was just getting impressions and translating them into words. Then I beganto worry about spirits.So one day I decided to probe a little deeper into this issue. One day after I left work, I went for a shortwalk and started asking this \"source\" some new questions:Q: \"What is your name?\"A: \"You can call me anything you like.\"Q: \"Do you have a name?\"A: \"Names are not important; wisdom is important. Remember, the message is important,not the source.\"Q: \"Are you a spirit?\"A: \"No, not as you think of it.\"Q: \"Then what are you?\"A: \"Someone who has your best interests at heart: I am you; another part of you.\"Q: \"Why are you here? Why am I hearing you?\"A: \"My job is to help you in any way that I can, to help you become more aware, to see thatyou pay attention to the lessons that you are learning.\"Q: \"If you're me, than why do you address me as 'you'?\"A: \"That's to help you tell the difference between your own thoughts and my messages.\"Because of some book I had read, I started calling it my \"inner voice.\" For months I distrusted my innervoice. Sometimes I would take its advice and sometimes I would not. Time after time, my inner voiceproved its guidance was sound, but still I would not trust it. And because I was afraid of what peoplewould think, I never told anyone.One day my inner voice started speaking with me, saying, \"Why do you constantly fight me?\" I replied,\"I just don't trust you; I've heard of stories where insane people murder and later say that 'God' or 'Voices'told them to kill. If you ask me, any kind of nonverbal communication seems really strange to me; ifanyone knew I talked to a voice inside of me, they would lock me up.\" My inner voice replied, \"Have Iever told you to kill people? No! Have I ever told you a lie? No! Have I ever given you any reason tomistrust me? No! Has anything I've said ever been wrong?

Try an experiment: try trusting me and taking my advice (while stillusing your own judgment and common sense) for one week, without fighting me. After one week, if I'velied to you or misguided you, feel free to ignore me. However, if my advice has been good, you can takethis as far as you want.\"I agreed to the experiment, and I started following the advice of my inner voice. One week passed andmy psychic awareness increased. I decided I would continue to trust my inner voice until it gave mereasons to distrust it.That was the beginning of a new cooperation between me and my inner voice: It started giving me moreadvice, helping me interpret my dreams and reminding me of things I had forgotten. For example, onemorning I had gotten my motorcycle out of the garage to go to work when my inner voice said to bringmy bag of tools with me--\"It'll come in handy today; You'll regret it if you don't.\" So I got off mymotorcycle, walked back inside and got my tool bag. I asked my inner voice if my motorcycle was goingto run into mechanical problems. It replied, \"Your motorcycle is fine.\" \"Then why should I bring tools?\"\"Trust me. You'll regret it if you don't.\" Later that day, as I pulled into a parking spot, I noticed a manwith a stalled truck. I asked, \"Having truck problems?\" He said, \"Yeah. You haven't got a Phillipsscrewdriver on you, do you?\" I got out the tool bag and gave him a screwdriver. I was glad I had broughtthe tools, and I thanked my inner voice. It was right--I would have regretted it if I had not brought thetools.My inner voice is often fond of helping people. For example, one day I went to my credit union, but Iarrived ten minutes before they opened. I walked down the street, wondering what I should do to kill thetime. Then my inner voice asked me to go into MacDonalds, which was in the opposite direction. So Iwalked to MacDonalds and went inside. The man in front of me ordered some coffee, but his speech wasvery slurred because he was deaf. The man repeated himself several times, but the cashier didn'tunderstand. I knew a bit of American Sign Language, so I acted as translator to allow him to speak withhis cashier. After I left the restaurant, I felt good inside. My inner voice congratulated me for a job welldone.My inner voice also provided me with \"psychic\" information I could not have known otherwise. One dayI decided to eat lunch in the cafeteria. I stood in line trying to decide what flavor of yogurt to buy. FinallyI decided to get blueberry yogurt, so I picked up a container. Then my inner voice said, \"Boysenberry.\" Iasked my inner voice, \"Do you mean I should switch?\" It replied \"That's okay. Eat what you like.\" So Idecided to keep my blueberry yogurt. I sat down and opened it, and there was boysenberry flavoredyogurt inside! The carton was plainly marked \"Blueberry\" and the carton was deep blue. But the yogurtinside was purple boysenberry.My inner voice carefully guided my actions, and it always worked out to my advantage. This journalentry from 1985 shows what I mean:02-09-85 Satchap10.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap10.html (3 of 6) [5/4/1999 9:18:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"More \"Psychic\" events. About a month ago I found out that Boston (the rock group) had amember named Barry Goudreau, who put out an album. Since I'm a fan of Boston I tried tofind the album, but it was out of print. I went to every record store I knew in theMinneapolis and St. Paul area, but nobody had it. I told JO that I'd mail her a copy of thealbum on cassette tape if I ever found it. Well, I was going to mail another tape to JO today,and my inner voice was very active.First I had to go to an office-supply store to find a mailer to mail the tape in. I went andfound a perfect-sized mailer, and was going to buy one, when my inner voice said, \"Gettwo!\" I asked it, \"Why? I'm not planning to send any more tapes for a while.\" My innervoice just said, \"Just get two; I'm sure you can find a use for the second one.\" I was in ahurry, so I didn't argue with my inner voice, I just bought two, without any plans to sendanother tape. When I went to the post office, I got the best parking spot, when all of theother available parking was taken. My inner voice suggested before I left from home that Ishould make some copies of the latest MSPR [Minnesota Society for ParapsychologicalResearch] newsletter. So after I left the post office, I went to the University to make morecopies of the newsletter. As fate would have it, I couldn't find a parking spot except twoblocks away from the print shop. My inner voice said, \"Park here; it's not that far to walk.\"So I parked there, and started walking to the print shop. On the way, I noticed somethinginteresting in a shop window, so I looked at the shop. It was a record shop, a very tiny one Ididn't know about and one I'd never been in. My inner voice said, \"Go in. The newsletterswill wait.\" So I went in. It was a very small record shop, but there was a section that said\"ON SALE.\" My inner voice said, \"Go over there and look in the \"G's.\" I replied mentally,\"Oh come on! I hunted in every record store in Minnesota for Barry Goudreau's album; thistiny store won't have it, and they wouldn't have it on sale!\" But I thought, \"Oh what theheck, it doesn't hurt to look.\" Sure enough, I had been very carefully guided to find BarryGoudreau's album, and it only cost me $2.19! I told the shop owner that I'd been huntinghigh and low for that album, and had been to almost every record store in the Twin Cities,and couldn't find it anywhere. He said, \"Really? That's interesting. And now you found it onsale.\"Then I made the copies of the newsletter. I came out of the print shop and I remembered thatI never fed my parking meter. My inner voice said, \"Don't worry about it. Go over to JRCAand buy some tapes to record the album.\" I argued back, \"But my parking meter is expired,and JRCA's tapes are not as cheap as Best Buy. I could go to my car, save myself a ticketand get tapes at Best Buy for $2.00 each, whereas JRCA tapes are usually $2.50 each.\" Butmy inner voice insisted that I go to JRCA. Despite always arguing with my inner voice, italways knows what is best for me. I went to JRCA, and asked \"How much are your MaxellUDXL-II's?\" The man went and grabbed four tapes (I wanted to buy four tapes, but I didn'ttell him that!) He told me the tapes were $1.99 each! I only had $9.00 left, so I had justenough money to buy four tapes! I got back to my car. No ticket!My inner voice has been responsible for much of the \"psychic\" information I have received. In manyways, it seems like \"cheating\" because I don't have to work for this information; it's there for the asking.I also found out my inner voice had a sense of humor. One morning I wrote down an out-of-bodyexperience and I lost track of the time. When I realized I was running behind, I left in a hurry. I boltedchap10.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap10.html (4 of 6) [5/4/1999 9:18:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"out the door when my inner voice suddenly interrupted, \"Hey, Bob, you forgot to lock the door!\" I ranback, locked the door and thanked my inner voice. My inner voice jokingly replied, \"You'd forget yourbody if it wasn't attached!\"I've also been helped by my inner voice during my out-of-body experiences. For example:07/25/82 Sun - OBE #80...I used the same swaying method to get out of my body again....I was stuck to my body. Ithought about it some more. I figured that the only way I could move was to close my eyesand trust my feelings. So I closed my eyes but immediately thought, \"No! If I close my eyes,I might fall asleep!\" If I have been reading for an hour, and I close my eyes, I will usuallyfall asleep. I can tell how likely this is to happen to me. So although I had started to move, Idecided to open my eyes, and I saw that I was again in the same place. I thought of anotherway: if I could change my vision to purely astral vision I should be okay, I thought. So Ilifted my arms out in front of me, and I tried to see clairvoyantly. I heard my inner voiceclearly say, \"Practicing clairvoyant vision here will greatly help your Earthly clairvoyantvision.\" I looked at my arms, not astrally, but clairvoyantly, as if trying to see a spirit fromthe physical world. My arms were transparent when I looked at them that way. They lookedlike transparent, dark black, filmy shadows. I studied them for a while, then blacked out.Here is another example of my inner voice helping me during an OBE:10-31-82 Sun - OBE #83...Another thing happened last night. It was like a lesson from my inner voice. It wanted toteach me the difference between clairvoyant vision and out-of-body vision. So first itshowed me a place clairvoyantly, and it said, \"this is clairvoyant vision.\" Then it showed methe same scene with out-of-body vision. I remember some of the differences. First, althoughboth pictures were clear and vivid, the out-of-body picture had more of a sense of depth. Icould tell my spatial location, because I had normal depth perception. In the clairvoyantvision, I saw the same things, and I could tell it was three-dimensional, but it was more likea photograph, where some particulars stood out more than others. In short, the clairvoyancewas like looking at a regular photograph, only some objects in the room seemed somehowemphasized. The out-of-body vision was different in that I was in the picture.My inner voice has been one of the most beneficial forces in my life. Amazing things can happen if youbegin using this tool. Your inner voice has always been there; all you have to do is listen inside.What exactly is an inner voice? Some people may believe it to be a spirit guide. Perhaps some of today's\"trance channels\" are merely talking to their inner voice, then doing the same sort of verbal translation.Personally, I believe the inner voice is a communications link to your oversoul, or higher self.My inner voice is notoriously honest and blunt. Once I asked my inner voice, \"Why didn't youcommunicate with me before that cold winter day?\" It replied, \"Why didn't you listen to me before?\" Iasked, \"Why don't you talk to me more often now?\" It replied, \"Why don't you listen to me more oftennow?\" Then it struck me: Why don't we all?chap10.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap10.html (5 of 6) [5/4/1999 9:18:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"EXERCISE 10Astral DoorwayThis is a variation of the OBE technique found in many books, such as Astral Doorways, byJ.H.Brennan.Get into a comfortable position and close your eyes. Relax as completely as you can, and start avisualization. Pretend that your consciousness shrinks into an infinitesimal pinpoint of light. Thenvisualize that you are standing in front of a locked door. Visualize the doorway any way you want, withfancy engravings and door knobs or whatever--personalize the doorway.Next, visualize yourself taking a fancy key out of your pocket (or from a chain around your neck, etc.)and unlocking the door. Open the door and step through the doorway. Close the door behind you, andlock the door again. The symbolic act of locking the door is for protection: Lock it every time you use it.Put the key back where you found it, and start walking forward. Imagine there is a tunnel in front of youwith a bright light at the end. Imagine that you walk to the end of the tunnel, step outside and findyourself outside your body, standing next to it.Next, visualize a complete out-of-body experience, in all the detail you can imagine. Imagine walkingaway from your body to a destination. Try to imagine and remember as much detail as possible. Whenyou are done, imagine walking back to your body. Imagine finding yourself back in the tunnel, walkingback to the door. Again, unlock the door, step through, and lock it again from the other side. Guideyourself back to full consciousness and open your eyes.Many authors say that this exercise in visualization can induce genuine OBEs as well as impressing theidea on your subconscious.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap10.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap10.html (6 of 6) [5/4/1999 9:18:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11The ClairvoyantBy the end of July 1981, I had 44 OBEs and psychic experiences were piling up. I was doing computerprogramming for the Minnesota DNR. One of my co-workers was LD, an ordinary woman except for hereyes. I couldn't look into her eyes, because they seemed to look right through me. Somehow I got thestrong impression she was clairvoyant. I talked to JP about her and he suggested I ask her. I didn't wantto; she'd probably think I was crazy.Everyone at work used a computer mail program, much like modern E-mail. One day I wanted to send amessage to my boss who wasn't very prompt at reading her on-line mail. LD read her mail often, so I senther a message that said, \"Please tell PL [my boss] to read her mail.\" A couple of days later, LD sent me amessage that said \"This is not a message.\" When I asked her to explain herself, she complained that shenever got any \"good\" mail. She sent me a non-interesting message because my message to her was sonon-interesting. I got gutsy. I sent her the following reply:FROM: BOB FRI JUL 31, 1981 9:39 a.m.So you don't want messages like \"Please tell PL to read her mail\" huh? Okay. I always like agood philosophical discussion. I'll start it out with a *BANG*.ARE YOU CLAIRVOYANT?Much to my surprise and relief, I was right: she was clairvoyant! She also had out-of-body experiences,and was even attending a spiritualist church. Like me, she was afraid to talk about it for fear of whatothers might think.LD and I became good friends. I rarely saw her in person because we worked different shifts, but weexchanged computer mail for a couple of years. During that time, we agreed on a little experiment: Toestablish proof during an OBE, I would try to visit her while out of my body. When I arrived, she couldsee me clairvoyantly and validate that my OBE was \"real.\" From then on, I started trying to reach LDduring my OBEs.Literally all of the books on out-of-body experiences claimed that during an OBE everything wascontrolled by the person's thoughts. To travel, they said, all one had to do is to think of the person orplace you wanted to visit, and you would be magically transported there. And I fully expected mythoughts to be all-powerful during an OBE, but I found out it wasn't that simple. The following excerptfrom my journals illustrates some of the problems I had during OBEs, especially when trying to travel toa specific place. It also illustrates several points about OBEs, including clarity of consciousness and howout-of-body sight works. The topic of consciousness is discussed in chapter 19 and out-of- body sight isdiscussed in detail in chapter 18.10/24/81 Sat - OBE #52...I woke up at 8:00am this morning and decided to try to have an OBE.

I mildly thoughtabout OBE, and I noticed how relaxed my body was.I felt a twinge of vibration, and I directed my attention to it. It grew stronger, but it wasn'tstrong like my first experience with the vibrations. It was more like the type I used to feelwhen practicing at night. \"Well,\" I thought, \"I wish I could remember what to do next, like Iusually do,\" but I couldn't, and already the vibrations seemed a little weaker. Then I thought,\"Well, I could arch my back, but it probably won't work.\" I couldn't think of anything else,so I decided to try it. I arched my back and threw my arms back behind my head. I wasimmediately flung into my astral body.When I reached the peak of my backward (downward) motion I started to sway back upagain. When I reached my body again I made an effort to get away, but I got stuck to thebody instead. I was fully conscious, glued tightly to my body, and amazed that myconsciousness was so perfectly clear. Strangely enough, I could \"see\" all right. I had theastral equivalent of physical sight...I freed my astral arms, reached behind me, and tried topush myself away from my body. As I pushed, I felt my astral body being stretched frombehind. I felt just like a cracker stuck in a vat of very thick honey. I felt millions of tinystreamers or ribbons attached to the two bodies (not with my hands; I just felt them there).Well, I gave it my best effort to get free, but I reentered my body after about 15 seconds.So I came to, and thought it was the end. I rationalized that I couldn't do it again, because Iwas fully awake. But my stubborn side demanded that I try it again. So I got comfortable,and looked for the vibrations. They came immediately, and I used the same method to getout again. I wasn't stuck to the body this time. I sat up with no problem, again with a goodsense of sight. I looked around and thought, \"Wow. I'm really conscious. I've never been thisconscious before. Not even in waking life. Now I'm going to do some experiments I've beenmeaning to do.\"The first experiment that came to mind was to test how sound worked. So I said somethinglike, \"Hello? Testing One-two-three.\" Although I formed the words with my astral lips andused my astral vocal cords, no sound came out. I faintly heard a tiny voice in thebackground, but it was too muffled to understand. Perhaps the problem was merely mybrain's interpretation of the sound.Anyway, I looked around and noticed how things looked different in an OBE. In the past, Ioften saw gray clouds during an OBE. But now I examined my sight more closely. I saw afew places where astral matter was just sitting in small bunches. And as I looked around theroom I noticed that everything was normal except now I could see different types of \"glows\"around everything. It was as if everything in my room had an aura of its own which gloweda little differently from any other thing....I also noticed that in some places there seemed tobe blots, or places where the aura was either black or covered up by a blackness. Then Ithought to myself, \"This is foolish. I am wasting my time. I should go at once to LD's housefor purposes of verifying the reality of this experience.\" But then I blacked out again andonce more woke up immediately in my body.Once again my analytical self said no, but I was too stubborn to give up. I repeated themethod, the vibrations came again, and I was ready for another excursion.

My astral vision opened up and I saw my mom coming in the house. I alsonoticed the clock in the kitchen, but it was too blurry to see the time. It was more likesecond-sight or clairvoyant vision than physical sight. I thought, \"I better not go through theback door; there is too much risk of being distracted. I better try the window.\" So I looked atthe window sill, then tried to go to it by pulling the image toward me. The image of thewindow did come to me, but when I looked again, I was still no closer to it. I tried to look atit closer. At once my eyes tried to be like a \"zoom-lens\" on a camera. But instead of my eyesmagnifying what I saw, I moved closer to it in a gliding motion. I only glided one footcloser when I came to a stop. I tried to do it again, and it worked a tiny bit. Then I was abouttwo feet away from the window sill.I thought, \"Enough of this moving-with-my-mind nonsense.\" I got up on my knees, thenstood up, preparing to step through the window. I decided to keep my eyes open so thatnothing could go wrong. As I stepped through the glass window pane, my consciousnessdimmed considerably. At once everything seemed strange. I was outside, but it looked sostrange that I couldn't tell where I was. I looked around and saw images, possibly from anoncoming dream. I couldn't even tell whether I was on the first-floor or on a second-story. Irecognized things, but everything seemed out of place. I saw toys, furniture and otherobjects. I twisted around and saw that I was outside, to the north of our kitchen, and onestory up! I became confused and eventually blacked out. I remember thinking, \"I don't wantto enter a dream now.\" I woke up fully conscious in my body again.I got comfortable and tried again. I immediately got the vibrations again as soon as I thoughtabout them. Instead of flinging myself backward, I just flung myself forward and sat up inthe astral body with no trouble.I thought, \"Almost every book I have on astral projection says that you can travel to aperson instantly by thinking about them. I'm going to try it again.\" So I closed my eyes andvisualized LD perfectly in every detail. I just sat there and visualized and nothing happened.I thought at first that my visualization wasn't good enough. But I visualized her perfectly inevery detail. I opened my eyes and I was still in bed sitting up in my astral body. I thought,\"This is getting me nowhere.\" I started to think about LD, hoping this would work betterthan visualizing her. Still no results. Then I blacked out for maybe half of a minute. Then Iwoke up in my body again and knew it was over....This entry shows another unsuccessful attempt at travel:04/10/82 Sat - OBE #70...I couldn't see my arm, so I figured that I must be out of my body. But just to make sure, Ireached my right arm down through my bed. When my arm went through the physical bedagain, I knew I wasn't physical. I swung my legs around, pulled away, and stood up. I triedto walk but couldn't. I was standing about four feet from my bedroom door, with my armsoutstretched toward it. As much as I tried to get away, I didn't move an inch. I thought, \"Myonly hope is to think of LD and maybe I will be transported there.\" I closed my eyes andchap11.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap11.html (3 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:18:31 AM]"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"thought of LD.

I was so overwhelmed by the change ofscenery without any physical sensations, that I lost all consciousness....03/25/84 Sun - OBE #105...I launched myself straight up in the air. I thought about LD and in a split-second, itseemed as if my consciousness blurred and instead of flying, I was transported somewhereat a blinding speed.

I want to fly there.\"I felt LD's presence for a second, but my confusion sent me back to my body againinstantly....11/10/85 Sun - OBE #118...I pulled out and up so that I was in a squatting position near my body's right arm, about afoot up from the body. I knew right away what I wanted to do. I had read almost all ofRobert Monroe's book, Far Journeys, so the first thing I wanted to try was to contact myguides--a process that Monroe calls, \"Ident Inspect.\" The first thing I tried was saying aloud,\"Ident Inspect,\" but nothing happened. Then I tried thinking, \"Ident Inspect,\" and nothinghappened. Then I heard the friendly thoughts of another person. It was a 30 year old man'svoice, and it said, \"What are you trying to do?\" I looked around, but I couldn't see anybody.I replied, \"I'm trying to contact my guides.\" The other voice said, \"Oh. But 'Ident Inspect?'\" Ifelt very foolish and laughed. I must have looked pretty foolish trying to contact my guidesby saying--or thinking--the words I had read in a book. Especially since the words were justthe author's attempt at describing an indescribable astral experience. And especially since Iwas so incompetent at using my mind as transportation. \"Never mind.\" I said, \"It's from abook I read.\"Then I tried to pull myself toward the \"Ident Inspect\" instead of thinking about it, but I lostall consciousness. The next thing I knew, I came to in my body a couple of hours later.To people who live without bodies, we must seem like simplistic children. When we are out of the body,we must be willing to try new things, learn from our mistakes, and not be afraid or embarrassed to ask forhelp. Above all, we should be able to laugh at ourselves.chap11.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap11.html (4 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:18:31 AM]"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"EXERCISE 11Falling In a WellAs always, get into a comfortable position and close your eyes.

Perhaps science had been too deeply ingrained in me, and a part of me still believedtraveling had to be more complex than thinking.Whatever the reason, I decided to take a different approach to out-of-body transportation.

I could not see in the physicalsense of the word, yet I knew where I was; I was in our back alley, and I knew I wasprojecting.I thought, \"Where should I go?\" and immediately decided \"To EJ\" without hesitation--I haddecided this before I went to bed....So I took a running leap and started off in the air.I rose above the houses quickly and was shaky for a while; I remembered many flyingdreams in which I have crashed. But I decided that if I controlled my mind, I would be allright. I flew higher and higher, and was touched by a little fear; I was afraid to fly too high.So I made effort to keep myself low enough for my own comfort. I could see the roofs ofhouses, the trees, and everything.When I first went up I realized I wasn't seeing physically, so I thought, \"I should see.\" ThenI saw everything okay. I saw my arms raised in front of me Superman-style. I started toclimb too high for comfort and I became afraid of getting too far away from Earth.With that thought, I started getting lower and lower. I descended very quickly until I wasforced to land. I landed okay in some street, on the slope of a hill. I thought, \"...Now I'llnever get there!\". The next thing I knew I was dreaming again.Nobody ever taught me how to fly, so I was proud of my first attempt. My next attempts were just asawkward, if not more so.05/08/82 Sat - OBE #72...I walked through the door and outside....It was bright and sunny outside.

I walked to the place just behind (east of) myhouse and I woke up there out of my body! I realized my condition, and I was surprised, butI stayed in perfect control of my emotions: The dream had prepared me to be calm for theupcoming OBE.I was standing outside, facing east. I thought about recent failures with astral levitation, but Isaid calmly to myself, \"It's worth a try.\" With an act of will, I started rising through the air,straight up, in an upright position (standing). It startled me but I told myself, \"Stay calm; it'sno biggie. I'm going to go for a nice, simple flying lesson. I'm not going to try for a bigadventure.\"I waited until I was about 15 feet in the air, then I said, \"Okay; that's high enough for now.\"The thought that I might not stop rising did cross my mind, and it caused me to rise a bitfurther, but I said to myself, \"It's okay. Nothing bad can happen. I can't be harmed. I'm incontrol.\" So I stopped in midair. I totally relaxed my astral body so I couldn't even feel itand I propelled myself forward through the air toward the east with a mere thought properlyplaced.I was slowly moving (flying) toward the east in a comfortable position. I thought, \"I'mtotally relaxed. This is a great bodily position to be in for flying.\" Then I looked down at myastral body, and I saw I was almost upright. My arms were hanging down, my head wasforward, and I was leaning forward about 30 degrees. My legs were relaxed and naturallybent about 45 degrees. The position I was in was almost exactly that of a 10-speed bicyclerider except I was more upright and my arms were relaxed by my side.I wasn't too steady in my flying. I bobbed up and down, left and right, trying to correct mydirection of flight. I was moving slightly faster now, and the ash tree in my yard was straightchap12.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap12.html (2 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:18:43 AM]"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ahead of me. I tried to steer around it, but I could not; I wasn't practiced enough at flying. Iwas just about to hit the tree, when I wiggled my torso to the left (north) and my headmanaged to miss hitting the tree. The rest of my body hit the tree, and much to my surprise itbent around the tree, and slithered around it elastically like a snake overcomes an obstacle.\"Whew!\"After that, there was nothing in my way. I started flying a little faster, and I purposelyclimbed higher and higher. I climbed to about four-hundred feet, then I descended back toabout two-hundred feet, so that I could see the scenery more closely. I looked down withoutany panic at all. I noticed that I could see everything well--equally well as in the body, andvery clearly. But I saw there was no sun, and I felt it was dark out. I could see fine, however,and everything appeared in a pale, almost gray light. It was like seeing a picture from aninfrared camera.I glided softly, somewhat slowly over the houses, eyeing the details of the neighborhoodhouses. I kept a close eye on all the details of everything as I moved, and I verified that Ionce again was in a real, waking situation. The details didn't change, nor did my speed. Andthe tremendous detail I saw around me, assured me I was seeing reality and not a dream. Ireasoned that:In dreams I notice very few details, only those that are necessary to the immediatestory unfolding around me. This wasn't a dream. Besides, I was fully awake andconscious.1. Even in ordinary reality we screen out and ignore most of the details of oursurroundings. So I knew I was experiencing reality with more clarity than normalin-the-body life.2. Since what I saw didn't change, (I was looking for changes) I knew my eyesight wasat least normal, and that I wasn't dreaming. Dreams have a bad habit of changing thescenery to produce certain situations and emotions.3. I verified and studied the details I saw below. The details were all the same as wakinglife.4. I flew to the east about three city blocks. I looked to the north, and I saw a man come out ofa house that was on the north side of Lowry Avenue. He stood and looked at me, up in theair. So I brought myself softly down across the street, on the south side of Lowry, also to thewest (I was now kitty-corner to where he was standing). He walked across the street towardme, and he came up to me. Just as he began to speak, I lost consciousness and entered thedreamlike semiconscious state. In this state the man and I exchanged a few words, and I lostconsciousness. The man was about 30 years old, with short brown, wavy hair, very friendly,with kind eyes. He wore casual clothes. He was a little taller than me, perhaps six feet tall. Ican't remember anything we said while I was in the dreamlike semiconscious state.This OBE brings up a very important question: What's the difference between a lucid dream and anOBE? I do believe that occasionally people confuse one experience for the other. It's very difficult to tellthe difference in some cases. Some people believe OBEs are poorly developed lucid dreams. Othersbelieve lucid dreams are poorly developed OBEs.chap12.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap12.html (3 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:18:43 AM]"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"A comparison of the two experiences is given in chapter 6 of With the Eyes of the Mind (An EmpiricalAnalysis of Out-of-Body States) by Gabbard and Twemlow (1984). The authors found the followingdifferences between OBEs and lucid dreams:Lucid dreams occur in 50%-70% of the population, whereas OBEs occur in 14%-25% of thepopulation.l There are two types of lucid dream: The first type occurs during REM sleep, and they are knownas Dream Initiated Lucid Dreams (DILDs). The second type occurs at the beginning phases ofsleep, and they are called Wake Initiated Lucid Dreams (WILDs). Both types of lucid dreamsoccur only during sleep or the onslaught of sleep. Typical OBEs are initiated from a waking state,much like WILDs are, but some OBEs unexpectedly occur from a waking state. Several peoplehave reported OBEs during which they have unexpectedly \"fallen out of their body\" from totalconsciousness, as described in chapter 9. Some of these occur when the physical body is active,such as walking down the street.l Lucid dreamers can consciously program their dream, whereas OBEers are usually passiveobservers.l Lucid dreamers have an integrated body image, whereas OBEers view themselves as separatedfrom the physical body, which is inert and thoughtless.l Lucid dreamers have consciousness that is vivid, even mystical, whereas OBEers experience amore normal form of consciousness.l Lucid dreamers view their experience as a production of their mind, whereas OBEers view theexperience as objective reality.l Lucid dreamers have brain waves typical of dreaming, whereas OBEers don't exhibit dream-likebrain waves.l Lucid dreamers have Rapid Eye Movements (REMs), whereas they are not observed during anOBE.l Lucid dreamers don't typically see their physical body, but OBEers usually do.l In addition, the authors felt that fewer lucid dreams have a lasting positive lasting impact on thesubject, whereas OBEs usually a highly positive lasting impact.l In a lucid dream, typically one does not dream about being in one's bedroom, as is common in theout-of-body state.l After a lucid dream, the subject accepts the \"unreality\" of the lucid dream after awakening. Afteran OBE, the subject usually asserts emphatically that the experience was \"real.\"l Many Lucid Dreams contain sexual content. In fact, author Patricia Garfield indicates that \"fullytwo-thirds\" of her lucid dreams have sexual content. Lucid dream sex is convincingly real; it feelsthe same as real sex. OBEs, however, rarely have sexual content. When OBEers report having\"astral sex,\" the experience is not anything like physical sex. It's more like an ecstatic mind-trip, atransfer of energy, or a euphoria, but it doesn't feel like physical sex.l Lucid dreams--like normal dreams--are not easily remembered, unless one is conditioned. Memoryis a key factor of having Lucid Dreams. OBEs, however, are usually remembered vividly for years,without prior conditioning.l Also, an out-of-body experience is a typical feature of a Near Death Experience (NDE).

When this happens I've noticed that thescenery in a lucid dream seems artificial, unlike OBE scenery. It's even possible to change the scenerywith your mind. Here is an example:05/17/86 Sat - OBE #126This morning I was in the beginning of a dream in which I found myself walking throughthe hallways of a hospital, and there were other people in the hallways. I realized I wasdreaming, and became lucid.First, I wanted to play with the lucid dream state for a little while, so I started glidingthrough the hallway. Then I levitated my feet and began to fly down the hospital corridor ata good speed. The hallway ended, but instead of hitting the wall I decided to change myfocus and create a tunnel that I could fly down. With an act of will, a hole appeared in thewall ahead, and a tunnel formed. The hospital scene slowly blended into a tunnel scene, thehallway becoming the tunnel. In real life, a tunnel of this size (without lights) would appearto be darker toward the end of the tunnel. The dream-tunnel I created didn't seem to end, andit appeared lighter in the back and darker in the front. There was a strange kind of grayishlight, almost like a fog, that obscured where the end of the tunnel.I started flying down the tunnel at a great speed, but I knew it was an illusion. I got boredwith flying, so I slowed myself down, lowered my feet and focused myself back in thehospital. I was in the same hallway. I turned and started floating myself back down thehallway in the opposite direction, turned left, and down toward the main desk. Then Istopped completely and decided that I didn't want the illusion of the dream anymore.I closed my eyes, to unfocus from the dream. The dream scenery melted away and myvision went black. I was floating out of my body. Then I decided to have some fun, and Istarted flying wildly in all directions, doing loop-the-loops and having a ball. I turned abouttwenty loops of great size, just like a jet airplane, but I was unable to open my eyes for someunknown reason. Still, the sensation of flying was a blast.I was having great fun flying so freely, and I decided to try an experiment: I decided to tryto fly to the sun. I stopped and stood straight up. I reached up over my head with animaginary line of force, and I kept reaching, trying to touch the sun with my line of force.When I decided that my line of force had reached the surface of the sun, I tried to \"feel\"what it was like at the end of the line. It really didn't feel any different, just a little \"denser\"(that's the only way I can describe it.)Then I started pulling myself straight up, along that line of force, toward the sun. Iaccelerated tremendously toward the sun, until I was traveling what I felt to be near thespeed of light. After about three minutes of this tremendous speed I still didn't feel anychange, so I stopped and I tried to see where I was, but I wasn't able to see anything. Withthat, I blacked out and woke up inside my body.chap12.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap12.html (5 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:18:43 AM]"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"If I had remembered any astronomy from my childhood, I would have known it takes more than eightminutes traveling at the speed of light to reach the sun. And I might not have been traveling at the speedof light.The difference between the out-of-body experience and the lucid dream is not always apparent. I guessyou'll have to rely on your own sense of \"real\" and \"not-real\" to decide this for yourself. One thing is forsure: more scientific study is needed. It is premature to jump to the conclusion that \"OBEs are actuallyvariant interpretations of lucid dreams\" as proposed by Stephen LaBerge in chapter 9 of his excellentbook Lucid Dreaming.EXERCISE 12Lucid DreamingMany OBE experts say that some part of our psyche is already familiar with the out-of-body experience.Many books claim that every night, some part of our psyche leaves our physical body and goes aboutwork of its own. What happens then is so far removed from the physical world that we usually onlyremember bits and pieces of these journeys as \"dreams.\"During OBEs and lucid dreams your body is asleep, but unlike dreams, your consciousness is awake.Well, your body goes to sleep every night. Suppose you had a way to \"wake up\" your consciousness butleave your body asleep. You could turn an ordinary dream into an OBE. You could wake yourself up andsay, \"Wait a minute. I know this is a dream. I'm wide awake now.\" From there you could either keepdreaming and have a \"Lucid dream,\" or wake yourself out of the dream and have an out-of-bodyexperience. Both are fun.Lucid dreams are great. You can literally do anything you want. You can remain completely consciousand do anything you can imagine. They're almost as fun as OBEs, but they're not as real. The scenerywill be fake. OBEs, on the other hand, are sometimes more constraining, but they're real.The problem is, when you're dreaming, you usually don't think to wake yourself up. In fact, you usuallydon't realize you're dreaming: You think you're awake.Here's a simple exercise to help you get around that problem. Ask yourself in all seriousness, \"Am Idreaming?\" Well, are you? Maybe you're just dreaming about reading this book. So how do you knowyou're not dreaming all this? I want you to make sure you're not dreaming this.If you ask yourself this question every fifteen minutes today, you'll probably ask yourself the samequestion tonight when you're dreaming. Daytime habits often carry over into dream habits.You don't have to ask it every fifteen minutes, but the more often you ask, the more likely you are tocatch yourself dreaming. You can set yourself a reminder, like your watch. How often do you look at aclock? Every time you look at a clock, try to figure out if you're dreaming. It won't take long. And itcould be a life-changing experience!So happy dreaming. And perhaps, happy OBEs!chap12.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap12.html (6 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:18:43 AM]"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap12.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap12.html (7 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:18:43 AM]"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13\"Ever the Silver Cord be Loosed\"My first strategy for contacting people from the out-of-body state--using thought power--didn't seem towork. My second strategy--flying--didn't work well either; some distraction always stopped me before Ireached my goal. I decided to try a third strategy, walking. At least until I could find a better way totravel. After all, what could go wrong with walking?That's when I discovered the \"silver cord\" the books talked about. Most books call it the silver cord,based on a verse in the Bible (Ecclesiastes 12:6). The cord, they said, connects the astral body to thephysical and will pull you back inside in case of danger. I soon found out the cord doesn't play fair:03/08/80 Sat - OBE #11...I jerked myself out of line of my body, and floated up. I tried to get away from my bodyby clawing the atmosphere and using my legs to push. I got about five feet away from mybody when the cord's pull became stronger and started pulling me back toward my body.I fought the pull and about one foot away from my bed, I resisted the pull for a few seconds,and then was violently sucked back into my body by my cord. After I was rejoined to myphysical body, I woke up and looked around.I wasn't in danger, or even emotional during the whole OBE, and yet the silver cord pulled me back inthe body against my will. Why?Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward Carrington tried to address the cord-problem in their book, TheProjection of the Astral Body. They claimed there was a \"cord activity range\" which was like afifteen-foot magnetic field all around the physical body. If you're within the cord activity range, theysaid, the silver cord was likely to pull you back inside. However, once beyond that range, you are free toroam.I was fairly angry with my silver cord, but what could I do to keep it from pulling me back to my body?Many books on astral projection warned me against tampering with my astral cord. They said if Idamaged the cord, my body would suffer great physical harm, and if my cord was broken my bodywould die.But what made them the experts? How often have people actually tried playing with their astral cord? Idecided to be cautious about my cord, but not cave in to fear and occult superstition. I decided not toaccept my limitations, but to fight back!07/30/81 Thu - OBE #44...My cord started a gentle tug back, but I responded immediately by resisting and, with aswimming-like motion, propelled myself forward in a southeast direction through the cornerof my bedroom and into our kitchen hall. I walked into the kitchen against the tug of myown astral cord.chap13.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap13.html (1 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:18:58 AM]"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"After struggling all the way to the kitchen, I got very angry at walking with the cord tuggingagainst me.

I was very tired. Thismorning I woke up early once, and went back to sleep.I started to dream. I dreamed that there was a party going on at our house. Then I woke up.The only thing I remember from that dream was (1) JP and CA were outside when thedream ended, (2) My bedroom door was open and (3) LD and some others were upstairs, inJP and CA's bedroom.I drifted back toward sleep, but then I realized that I could project very easily; all I had to dowas to throw my consciousness forward, and start astrally swaying. I was laying on my rightside. So I pushed my whole consciousness forward. At once I was zapped into my astralbody, and I started swaying forward and backward. The vibrations had built until they werenoticeable, but were getting constantly stronger. I knew I was now partly in and partly out ofmy body....On a forward swing (or swaying) I lunged forward, and twisted up to separate the twobodies, in a very sudden and violent manner. In my astral body now, as I made themovement I felt a great tearing sensation coupled with the feeling that my solar plexus hadjust dropped and I felt a bit sick to my stomach.I was not seeing, but once again mind-sensing. I was about a foot above my body, and I wasin a laying position, pointed perpendicularly away my body and about a foot away from thebed. For a second I worried that I might have torn my astral cord, and made a permanentprojection (death). Then I thought, \"Well, it's too late to worry about it now. Either I'm okay,or the damage has already been done.\" So I ignored it and decided to try to contact LD.I was groggy. I noticed that I seemed to have a computer printout in my hand, and I felt theneed to take this printout with me and show it to LD. I still had that last dream in mind. Mybedroom door looked open, although the physical door was really shut. And I somehowbelieved that LD was upstairs in JP and CA's bedroom. So I took the end of my computerprintout, and I walked into the dining room. I didn't want my computer printout to tear, so Iwalked very carefully, and I turned to see how my printout would unfold itself. The otherend was sitting on the floor next to my bed--apart from my body.I walked backwards and I watched it unfold and grow longer with each additional pagebeing unfolded from the main pile. Upon looking back into my room I saw the printout, butnot any astral cord, so I realized that the printout that was unfolding WAS my astral cord [inchap13.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap13.html (2 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:18:58 AM]"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"disguise]!

No more Mister Nice Guy!02/06/82 Sat - OBE #64...I was in my astral body, swaying. I struggled, and pulled away [from the body] a little bit,but I felt the resistance of my astral cord.Last night I had been conditioning myself for these problems. I kept saying the followingaffirmations to myself: (1) When I am in my astral body, everything is governed by thoughtwhether conscious or unconscious. (2) Nothing on Earth is solid to me, except in my mind.(3) I will feel no resistance, nor any restriction of my freedom. (4) I will be able to gowherever I wish without interruption. (5) I should be able to see through walls and ceilings.Well, now I felt the resistance of my astral cord, and I thought, \"Hey! This isn't fair! I amprojecting and I should be free!\" But just then I was violently sucked back into my bodyafter having resisted as long as I could. I woke up in my physical body after a shortblackout, and without any ill effects.I said to myself, \"I'm not giving up that easily!\" and I tried the same procedure. It wasrelatively easy this time, and I slipped right out. I pulled away from my body on purpose,and I started walking toward my bedroom door. This time I could feel my astral cord takingup the slack, and exerting a greater force. I was three feet from my body on the bed, and Iwas upright and facing my bedroom door.When I felt my cord starting to tighten, I turned around and faced my body. I'd like to notehere that I was only mind-sensing during the whole projection. And since I was not\"seeing,\" I had to feel where my cord was. I felt it, and it was now joined to my astral self atthe bottom of my rib cage, or just a little below my heart, and between where the ribs dividegoing down.The cord itself felt smooth but very rigid, like a piece of garden hose. The cord was aboutone centimeter in diameter.Anyway, I put my hand just above my cord, so that I would see where it was when I wokeup. I somehow thought that my physical hand would be moved to that spot too. I got into akung fu stance with my weight mostly on my back leg. I was now prepared to playtug-of-war, with my own astral rope!I yanked at the cord as hard as I could. I started resisting its pull, and I kept trying toreassure myself that I should, by all rights, be free from this menace.I resisted the cord's pull for a little while, as long as I could, and then I got sucked back in[my body] again.Apparently my kung fu stance didn't help me resist the cord any better.

Manypeople who have had out-of-body experiences or near-death experiences have reported seeing a cord orcable linking their astral body to their physical body. People from all societies and all parts of the worldhave reported seeing a cord regardless of location, age and religious beliefs.Just as many people don't see any silver cord, even when they look for one and even when they expect tosee one. I've had OBEs in which I have seen a cord, and ones in which there was apparently no cord. Ipersonally believe that the astral cord exists only as a psychological comfort or point of reference. I don'tbelieve it has any actual connection with the physical body. Also, I don't believe it has any function,except as a psychological symbol.I don't believe that playing with the silver cord can damage the body, and I don't believe the body will dieif the cord is severed. However, I caution you against such antics, just to be safe.EXERCISE 13Black Box VisualizationHere is another visualization exercise: Get into your favorite OBE practice position, close your eyes andrelax as completely as you can. Let yourself fall deeper and deeper toward sleep until you areconsciously watching hypnogogic images.Then visualize that a black box, about three inches on a side, is sitting three feet in front of your eyes andslightly to the left of the center of your imaginary viewing screen. Hold that visualization for about thirtyseconds.Next, visualize a cloud of gray, about the same size, sitting to the right of the box. The cloud has nodefinite shape, but it is taller than it is wide, looking almost like a snowman. Visualize the two figuresside by side for another thirty seconds.Next, visualize a thread of light slowly reaching from the black box to the gray blob. It reaches closerand closer until it reaches the gray blob, filling it with light. If you feel any strange sensations, remaincalm and follow your impulses.If nothing happens, repeat the visualization again from the beginning a few times. Make sure you do itslowly and as vividly as you can.What in the world does this do? Well, I once used this visualization to leave my body. During thevisualization, I felt a sharp sensation along my spinal column, and I got the urge to physically throwmyself backward, into the bed. I followed the impulse and tried to throw myself backward, but only myastral body moved, and I was out of my body. It was a very easy OBE. I don't know how or why itworked, but it did.chap13.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap13.html (4 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:18:58 AM]"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap13.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap13.html (5 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:18:58 AM]"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14A Helping HandMy third travel strategy, walking, was as unsuccessful as the first two strategies.

I reasoned that the residentsof the OBE-world should be more-adept at traveling than I was. And since I wasn't having much successat traveling by myself, I decided to ask someone for help.Until that time, I was content to explore on my own. I was afraid to contact \"spirits\" because I wasn't toosure of their power and what they could do to me when I was \"out.\"07/25/82 Sun - OBE #80...I was completely out of my body....I opened my eyes. I seemed to be stuck to my physicalbody. I tried to use my arms to turn myself around and get away from the body. Andalthough I felt I was turning, my eyes told me I wasn't moving at all. I looked carefully and Iwas still in the same position. It was like being dizzy--I seemed to sense motion (spinning)but I wasn't going anywhere. I thought about this for a little while. I thought for a minuteabout what I should do to get away from my body. Then I blacked out.I came to in my physical body, totally conscious, but in a very good condition for projection.I decided to try again. I used the same swaying method to get out of my body again. I triedto push my midsection up and down until I felt a slight tingling of the vibrations, then I triedphysically to do the same thing. I gathered momentum by swaying, and I was pulled by itout of my body.I separated from my body, only to discover I was stuck to my body again. I thought about itsome more. I figured that the only way I could move was to close my eyes and trust myfeelings instead of my eyes.I closed my eyes but immediately thought, \"No! If I close my eyes I might fall asleep!\" If Ihave been reading for an hour, and I close my eyes, I will usually fall asleep. I can tell howlikely this is to happen to me. So although I had started to move, I decided to open my eyes,and I saw that I was again in the same place.I thought of another way: if I could change my vision to purely astral vision I should beokay, I thought. So I lifted my arms out in front of me, and I tried to see clairvoyantly....Ilooked at my arms, not astrally, but clairvoyantly, as if trying to see a spirit from thephysical world. My arms were transparent when I looked at them that way. They looked liketransparent, dark black filmy shadows. I studied them for a while, then blacked out.This time I woke up separate from my body, but inside it. I was surprised at that, and wasvery happy to still be out of the body. I seemed to be freer now than before.

Every previous attempt at walking through that wallhad not worked, so I tried something different--keeping my head outside, I jumped up in theair, and did a somersault through the wall, and landed outside on my feet. I was free!I walked to the back yard. I was preparing to fly, but I wanted a clear flying path. The ashtree was once again in my way. I walked near it, and then I jumped up and flew to one of itslimbs. I was perched on an ash tree limb. I saw the apple tree next door, and some othertrees. I thought, \"How stupid of me to try to go through the tree. There are just more trees. Icould have just walked to our alley and taken off there.\" But now I was up in a tree! I lookeddown. It was a long fall. I was afraid of jumping from that height! I considered thepossibility of flying to the apple tree. I was just about to try it, but then I blacked out oncemore.I was unconscious for a little while--maybe 15 to 30 seconds. Then I woke up again. I wasstill out of my body! This one was not unlike the first two. I was curious about thatclairvoyant vision again. I held up my arms again, and I studied them carefully withclairvoyant vision. I was able to alter my vision. I could change my vision so that I couldtotally see my astral hands as solid, not transparent, but I had to focus on them intently [tosee them this way]. I experimented with that clairvoyant sight for a while, then I lostconsciousness again.I was unconscious again for a short time, and I woke up once more out of my body! I wasfree again, and I rejoiced! I went over to the north wall again. I bent over and did anothersomersault to get outside.

Icouldn't see him, but I felt he had a very large aura. I figured that I couldn't see him becausehis vibrations were much higher than mine.He called mentally and two of his spirit-friends came. These two friends, I felt, were lessdeveloped [than the master whose presence I felt]. They were servants of that powerfulbeing. They weren't bound to him, but they always did what he asked, because serving himwas their way to advance themselves spiritually. He told his friends exactly what to do. Ididn't hear them exactly, but I could tell he instructed them to accompany me to LD's house.The two friends were normal-looking spirits that were my own size. And I could see themall right. They were very friendly to me, and we became friends right away. These twospirits were average-looking men. One had brown hair, and the other had slightly lightercolored sandy brown hair. They were happy, and they were good friends. The \"master\" spiritleft. Unfortunately I blacked out.When I woke up again, I was still out-of-body. The three of us were walking East onLarpendeur Avenue, toward Snelling Avenue. The two friends were talking. I tried tomemorize pieces of evidence that I could look for later, to prove the experience was \"real,\"chap14.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap14.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:19:17 AM]"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"but I forgot them all....After we walked for a little while, I suddenly felt a pain. I felt sick to my stomach and weak.I had to an urge to go back to my body. I didn't want to fight the feeling. I knew I had to getback to that body. I stopped them, and I said I was sorry, but I had to get back to my body.They were very understanding about the whole thing. One said, \"Sure thing. Take it easy,okay?\" So we exchanged our goodbyes.I faced east and closed my eyes. There was no lapse of consciousness; I saw completeblackness for a little while. I woke up out of my body again! I got up and thought, \"Howstrange! Why did we bother walking--why didn't we just fly [to LD's]? This time I shouldfly there. Walking is way too slow.\" I stood up, and this time I blacked out. I wasunconscious for a while.Then I started dreaming. I dreamed I was having an OBE, but it was very obviously adream, and not a real OBE.EXERCISE 14Imaginary MusicThis exercise comes from a friend, JH. He used this exercise to leave his body:First, get comfortable and relax as much as possible. Then choose a song you know very well. As vividlyas you can, pretend the song is playing. Try to focus your complete attention on the music you arelistening to in your imagination. Practice this until it seems as if the music is really playing. Again, tryfor as much realism as possible.JH says when you can imagine the music clearly, the music can easily turn into the vibrations, and youcan easily escape your body.Some people are better at using their imaginations with sound rather than pictures. Try both and seewhich works best for you.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap14.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap14.html (3 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:19:17 AM]"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15What Astral Programmers Do in Their SleepMany books on out-of-body experiences, especially those of occult origin, say that we subconsciouslyleave our bodies and do \"astral work\" during sleep. The trouble is, they usually don't say what astralwork is, except maybe helping people with their \"final transition,\" Death.My first OBE, with the split-consciousness, showed me that parts of the psyche can be very active duringsleep. But I never considered myself an astral social worker by night. That is, until the morning ofTuesday, September 1, 1981, when I had my 46th OBE.Sometime after midnight, I unexpectedly woke up out of my body. When I awoke, I was standing next tomy bed, in the middle of my bedroom. I was a bit surprised, but before I could gather my wits about me,I was \"put under\" by my subconscious. It felt as if I were knocked out by a professional anesthesiologist.A while later, I woke up out of my body a second time. Again, I was standing in the middle of mybedroom. This experience was also cut short when I was \"put under\" by my subconscious.It seemed an hour or so passed. Then, just like my first OBE, I slowly started to become more consciousand I was aware of having multiple consciousness. My awareness increased until I was fully conscious,but this time my conscious self was an observer. I was allowed to watch with astral vision, but I wasn't incontrol. Another part of me was running the show, doing some very serious work, and knew all the toolsof the trade. What I saw was astounding.I was gliding slowly up from below, until I saw what looked like a human brain. I could sense the body itbelonged to. Somehow, I knew it was my own body. The brain looked like about one hundred smallspheres of light, grouped in the shape of a human brain. Each sphere had a different brightness. I noticedthat four particular spheres were shining brighter than the rest, and I knew they had been cut off from theother spheres. Using my mind tools, I worked for about 10 minutes adjusting neural pathways,\"rewiring,\" and manipulating energy. Then I recharged the four spheres with energy. Next, I programmedthe brain so that it would use different neurological connections and make automatic adjustments! I was apsychic healer in my sleep!Satisfied with my work, I left. I approached a second brain and followed the same process. I rewired,transferred energy, then programmed the brain to aid in the healing process. After I was finished with thesecond brain, I worked on a third and then a fourth.The fifth brain was a much more difficult case. As I approached the brain, I could tell that it belonged toa forty- year-old woman with dark hair. Like the others, she had some physical problem and I sensedmany damaged parts of her body.I went through the same sort of procedure. I looked at the brain and saw many messed up spheres. Isensed that she had stopped using certain parts of her brain until she had lost the use of these spheres. Ipulled myself very close to those spheres as if I were looking through a magnifying glass, and began towork. I worked for about an hour on her, \"rewiring\" and opening pathways. I transferred a lot of energyto her. My energy spread throughout her body, healing as much damage as possible. Then I spent a longchap15.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap15.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:19:30 AM]"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"time programming her brain to heal her body. As I left, her body and brain were both busy with thehealing process.As I approached a sixth brain, the observing part of my psyche began to gain more control. As thishappened, I was poured like a liquid into my body. As I came to, I was in complete awe. I looked at myclock and saw it was 2:00am. I went over the experience several times in my mind so I would not forget.Then I drifted off toward sleep.At once, I saw another brain. Then my subconscious realized that \"I\" was consciously tagging alongagain. It quickly went back to my body and I woke up again. I dozed off again and this time I was outcold. My subconscious didn't take me along this time. The next memory I have is of dreaming sometimelater in the night.This OBE taught me many things. It taught me that sleep is not \"idle\" or \"wasted\" time. It taught me theimportance of helping people, and the importance of work. It was a humbling experience; It gave me agreat reverence toward my higher self.Some portion of our psyche leaves our bodies whether we like it or not, and devotes a great deal of timeand energy to astral work. Perhaps sleep is necessary to our survival and sanity because we need thissubconscious astral activity. It's up to us to choose whether to be conscious and learn from theexperience, or to remain unaware.EXERCISE 15Moving the Pinpoint of ConsciousnessI've used this exercise to escape my body a few times. It can also induce other weird but harmless effects.Close your eyes and spend a few minutes relaxing as completely as you can and clearing your mind of allworries and idle thoughts. Then spend a few minutes trying to decide where your consciousness is seated.Is your consciousness in the center of your head, or perhaps somewhere between the eyes? Wherever itis, visualize a tiny pinpoint of light at that point. You don't have to be exact about the location.If you're not comfortable with where you have visualized the pinpoint of light, move it until you arecomfortable with it. Spend a few minutes visualizing that pinpoint of light as clearly as you can. Try toshrink your awareness until you are only aware of your head. Then shrink your awareness even further,so that you can't feel anything except that pinpoint of light.Next, visualize the point of light slowly moving down toward the base of the brain, where the cerebellumis. Move it about four inches down, then slowly move it back to its original position.Repeat this visualization several times. This visualization can induce the vibrations and get you out ofyour body.chap15.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap15.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:19:30 AM]"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap15.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap15.html (3 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:19:30 AM]"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16To BelieveThe \"Brain Fixing\" incident taught me an important lesson. When I was trying to prove my experienceswere \"real,\" I had problems achieving my goals and I was usually disappointed. When I just let myselfflow with the experience, I had fun and I felt good about the experience. Suddenly I realized that I didn'tneed to prove anything to anyone. There truly is a higher purpose to our experiences, whether in the bodyor out. All that matters is that we believe in the magic within us and trust that we will be guided to whatis best for us.I never did make it to LD's house in a fully-conscious OBE, but I had some close calls. For instance, onOctober 4, 1981, after a fully-conscious OBE (#51) had ended, I entered a semiconscious dream state inwhich I was at LD's apartment. I took note of several details, including a pile of clothes I saw sitting on abed. After I described the experience to her, she said it sounded \"actually quite like our apartment.Especially the part about the clothes. I had done wash and put them on the extra bed.\" Eventually LDchanged jobs and I lost contact with her.Since I made the decision to \"go with the flow,\" I haven't been disappointed. My goal--to make mypresence known during an OBE--also came with time and patience. In 1985, I had the following OBEduring which my roommate, JH, was aware of my presence.09/07/85 Sat - OBE #116JH [my roommate] and I were discussing OBE last night until 2:00am after watching ahorror movie on television. We both decided to try having OBEs, and we agreed that ifeither had an OBE, he would try to contact the other in the OBE state....I first woke up at around 7:20am, and I thought about trying to have an OBE. I was verytired, and fell asleep before I had a chance to try.I woke up next around 9:30am and I thought, \"I've almost wasted the whole morning, andhaven't even tried to have an OBE.\" So I decided to try to have an OBE. I got into a straightposition with my arms at my sides. I let myself approach sleep, but then I thought strongly,\"I WANT to have an OBE.\" So I started by visualizing a line of light (about three feet long)going straight up from between my eyes. I reached out with my consciousness to the end ofthe line, and pulled myself toward the end of the line. Then I created a rocking or swayingsensation by pulling and then pushing my consciousness along this line toward its end.Almost at once I felt the vibrations sweep over me, but they were very mild; almostunnoticeable. The vibrations faded away after a few seconds, and I was separate from mybody.My eyes were open, and the first thing I tried to do was look down. I tried to turn my headdown, but although I had the sensation of my head turning, my vision stayed where it was,staring at the upper corner of the bedroom. My mouth was very dry and stiff. My visionwouldn't move. I had a slight feeling of dizziness as I turned my head down, but my visionchap16.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap16.html (1 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:19:48 AM]"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"stayed the same, so I stopped.Then I noticed some sort of spirit form gliding from the direction of JH's room, into myroom, and I thought it was JH. I thought, \"JH beat me here! Good! Now I don't have to gointo his room to get him. I wonder if he'll remember doing this.\" The spirit figure I sawglided up next to me, and came to rest to my left, near the bed. I turned my eyes to the left tolook (I could not turn my head) but I couldn't make out the spirit figure too well.As I studied the ghostly figure, another spirit form glided in and joined the first. As I studiedthe two figures, their forms started fading in and out, so that parts of them were completelytransparent, parts of them were visible but translucent, and parts of them were completelyvisible. I could see now that it was not JH. One of the spirits was a man, and the other was awoman, and they grasped each other while they reclined on the bed, less than a foot away tomy left. They didn't seem to notice me at all.I wondered if the images I saw were really spirits, or if they were thought-forms, or justafterimages from a time when two such people occupied the same room years before. I wasstrangely calm and not alarmed at seeing the spirits. Since the spirits didn't seem to careabout me, I turned my attention away and concentrated again on trying to get away from mybody.I reached behind me, and tried to pry myself away from the physical body, but again I hadthe feeling of movement, although my sight remained the same. I tried to say some words,like \"I am projecting now, so I should be able to get away,\" but the words seemed to comeout physically. And since my throat was very dry and stiff the words came out slurredtogether, as if my whole mouth was deadened by novocaine. I made a mental note toremember all of this, and I let myself back down into my body.I looked around once more, and as I looked, many other spirits started fading in and out ofmy vision. I concentrated on seeing them and as I looked they became clearer in my vision,and soon it seemed as if the whole room was crowded with spirits of different kinds.Most of the spirits were between the ages of 30 and 50, and they were talking to each otherin this crowded room. It reminded me of a dance or a wedding reception because there weremany people, crowded together, talking to each other. I moved my eyes back and forth, toscan the different spirits in the room. As I moved my eyes, the spirits seemed to move too,and it caused a strange effect. I was curious why, but it didn't bother me.I studied some of the spirits in the room, and I remember what some of them looked like: aman about 35 years old, wearing 50's style formal clothes, with some scratches and bruiseson his face. He was talking to a woman, dressed also in a 50's style formal dress. None ofthese spirits seemed to notice me either, so I decided to ignore them and try to get awayfrom the body again, to contact JH.I lay back into my body and then I tried lifting my feet over my head to do a backwardsomersault, thinking that it should work, since it has always been successful in past OBEs.Again I felt my consciousness move completely in a circle, and I quickly came full circleand found myself back in the same position lying down. My consciousness faded into thesame dream I had before I woke up.chap16.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap16.html (2 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:19:48 AM]"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"After a while I realized I was dreaming again, and I forced myself awake, and I woke upstill out of the body. I thought, \"I am out of my body, and I am controlling this realityentirely. I should be able to get away from this body.\" I decided that the only way I wasgoing to get anywhere was to close my eyes and walk, relying entirely on my other senses.So I closed my eyes and bent my knees down until my legs were through the bed and myfeet were touching the floor. I used my arms and a kind of swaying motion to stand up. Itook a few steps toward JH's room. Then I stopped and wondered whether it would be bestto walk into the living room, and through JH's bedroom door, or through the physical closet.I decided to walk through the closet and straight into JH's room. So I kept going toward JH'sroom and I approached JH's bed. Just as I started to look around, I was picked up andforcefully pulled back to my body.The next thing I knew I was back in my body, and my eyes were closed. I felt as if I werestill out of my body only I felt very stiff and rigid. I forced my eyes open, and as I did that, Ibecame more physical, until my physical eyes opened and I was again completely in myphysical body.I turned to look at the clock and it felt great to be able to turn my head. The time wasslightly after 10:00am. I recalled the whole incident in my mind. Then, I got up to type itinto the computer. JH heard me get up, and came out and asked me if I had an OBE.JH said that he was experimenting with the hypnogogic state when he saw me in his bedroom. Otherpeople have felt my presence too.I am a believer and a skeptic. I must believe in the paranormal, since I've experienced it firsthand. At thesame time, I am still skeptical in many ways. Skepticism is healthy because it can keep us from losingtouch with reality and going off the deep end. We shouldn't believe everything we hear or read, or everyline of trash fed to us by cults. We must always believe in ourselves, but question what makes sense.The difference between a skeptic and a believer is simply this: perspective. When I was a skeptic, Iapproached everything with a negative attitude. I was a pessimist. Everything was hogwash until it wasproven to be real. I thought of psychics and mystics as frauds, liars and charlatans who lived lives ofdelusion.My psychic experiences--particularly my OBEs--changed my attitude from negative to positive. I seepeople as inherently good. Obstacles are merely lessons to be learned. My outlook on life is positive andoptimistic. And it pays to be optimistic. I believe in magic because I have experienced it firsthand.EXERCISE 16Quiescing The MindIn my opinion, the single most important factor in leaving the body is that you focus your consciousnessdown to a single focused barely noticeable thread.The best way to explain this is with an analogy. Imagine two parents who have lots of small kids thatchap16.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap16.html (3 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:19:48 AM]"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"make lots of noise. At night, the parents send their kids to bed and wait for them to fall asleep beforedoing adult things. They try to be covert, so they listen for the kids' bedroom noise to quiet down, andwhen it does, they proceed. The lack of noise implies, but doesn't guarantee, that the kids are asleep.Similarly, I think we all have a Higher Self or Oversoul that waits until our consciousness is completelyquiet or quiesced. At that point, it goes on to do otherworldly things.I have found that if I narrow my consciousness down into a single thread, (where my mind doesn'twander) and if I can hold my consciousness that way for about three minutes, the vibrations will rush inand start the separation process.After a certain point where the vibrations have run their course, I broaden my consciousness back tonormal and I allow my normal thinking process to continue. But only after I'm in a fully consciousout-of-body state. It feels like sneaking through a security door with someone, unnoticed.It's not enough to be single-minded. You have to narrow down your consciousness until it's almostunnoticeable to even yourself. It's also not enough to concentrate your mind. Concentration is differentfrom quiescing your mind.So here's an exercise for focusing your consciousness down to a quiesced state: Have you ever seen aflash of lightning, and stopped to listen for the thunder? Or perhaps you heard someone knocking at yourdoor or the telephone ringing from several rooms away? At those times, you tend to stop thinking andlisten. And your mind is quiesced for a second or two. Well, pretend that some sound will occur in thefuture, and just listen for it. For a short time, your consciousness will stop all processing and go into aquiesced state. As you practice, increase the length of time that you listen.Instead of being a thinker, try to be a listener or an observer. Instead of following a train of thought, jumpoff the train. Don't think; act. Don't concentrate on anything; just pretend you're staring at a blank screenin front of your eyes. Become passive, patiently watching and waiting.At first, you won't be able to suspend your thoughts for long. With practice you can learn to prolong thispassive state.When the vibrations hit, it can be quite shocking, and may break you out of the quiesced state of mind. Ifyou start to think, \"Oh my God, what's happening to me?\" or \"What should I do next?\" then you've lostthe quiesced state temporarily and the vibrations will start to fade away. Luckily the vibrations takeseveral seconds to fade away--just enough time to recover the quiesced state. Just concentrating on thevibrations getting stronger is not enough--they will only get stronger when you get back to the quiescedstate of mind.Learn to hold your quiesced state of mind regardless of what is happening to your body. After thevibrations come, you need only hold the quiesced state for approximately 10 to 15 seconds and then youcan just get up and walk away from your body.chap16.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap16.html (4 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:19:48 AM]"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap16.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap16.html (5 of 5) [5/4/1999 9:19:48 AM]"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17What the Books Didn't Tell MeAs I began having more out-of-body experiences I naturally set about doing my own type of scientificexperiments. In my travels I encountered some peculiar things that weren't mentioned in the many OBEbooks I had read. Other peculiarities were only touched on by these books, but not explained to mysatisfaction. Here are some of my findings:I. Getting Stuck to the Physical Body.The first undocumented thing I ran across was the problem of getting \"stuck\" to my physical body. Inseveral OBEs I found myself seemingly \"glued\" to my physical body, unable to move away from it. Atypical instance was my third OBE:12/09/79 Sun - OBE #3...I was partly out of my body. My left arm was free. I waved it back and forth and looked atit to make sure it was really happening, and I wasn't dreaming. I tried to move more of mylimbs, but they wouldn't budge. I tried to use my free left arm to push the rest of me out, butthe rest of me was secure (I couldn't move my physical or astral legs. They were cataleptic.)I felt that if I put my left astral arm back in its physical counterpart, I would leave the astralstate. But [being almost paralyzed] I had no other choices. I waved my left arm again, andlooked at it, to once again make sure I wasn't dreaming. Then I returned it to its physicalcounterpart. That brought me back to the physical world, and I came to.After some experimentation I found a few ways to \"unstick\" myself and pry away from the physicalbody. A good example is given below.01/22/83 Sat - OBE #88...My first problem was...to get away from the physical body that usually claims some sortof hold on my astral counterpart. This time I had no problem: I turned over so that I wasface down (my body was face up). Then I pushed myself up until I was on my hands andknees. My hands, knees, and legs were still in coincidence with the physical body. Then Ijust withdrew my limbs one by one, and climbed off the bed. I was free from the body.Most OBE books agree that out-of-body \"reality\" is mostly governed by thoughts, fears and expectations.In one OBE, I used my fear of falling off the bed to counteract my expectation of being stuck, thusfreeing myself.Despite my limited success I still haven't found a satisfactory solution to the problem of getting stuck tomy body, but I do have a word of consolation: This happened to me more often when I was first learninghow to consciously get out of my body. As time went on I had fewer experiences of being stuck.chap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (1 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"II. Getting in the Body Backwards.This has only happened a few times, but it's an interesting experience when it happens. The first time thishappened I was at my parents' lake cabin in northern Minnesota. I was feeling a bit under the weather andI was tired. I went into my bedroom to lie down for a bit. I was lying flat on my back with my head to theWest and my feet to the East. I induced the vibrations and floated about three feet above the body. Myastral body seemed completely paralyzed and I had no control at all:09/21/80 Sun - OBE #23...I tried to go up, but I couldn't. I wanted to go forward, but couldn't. Finally I wanted toturn around, and I rotated, so that my astral head was above my physical feet and vice versa.I started going down into my body the wrong way! Try as I may, I couldn't stop it. Finally Iwent into my body and blacked out for a second. When I came to again, I was disoriented; Ithought I should be facing East like my astral body was, but woke up facing West in myphysical [body]. In one instant I was in my astral body, looking at the West wall of theroom. The next instant I opened my eyes and saw the East wall. I felt intensely disoriented,which was like a dizziness, but it seemed more physical than mental. In other words, itseemed as if I were still physically feeling the spinning or reorientation my astral body.About one minute later, the dizziness went away and I felt normal.Since no harm ever came from these incidents, \"getting in\" the wrong way was never a problem.III. The Blackout on Exit and Reentry.Many books on the out-of-body experience claim that when a person leaves his or her body, there isusually a split-second blackout. The same blackout happens when the person reenters the body. What isthis blackout, why does it happen, and what can we learn from it?The split-second blackout that usually precedes and follows OBEs is a great concern because it maymake the experiences seem more subjective and less objective, less \"real.\"Skeptics may say that the blackout suggests a loss of consciousness during which the person mightactually start dreaming. They would say that the blackout is some kind of shortcut to the Delta brainwave state that accompanies our everyday dreams. Therefore, they would say the OBE is just a dream,with only subjective reality.Some theories claim that the blackout is necessary. Crookall believed the blackout is caused becauseneither the physical nor astral bodies are available as a vehicle of consciousness during the transferenceof consciousness. Some people believe the blackout happens because only the subconscious self canseparate the soul from the body; therefore, the consciousness of the individual must give up all control tothe subconscious during the transference. Others maintain that the blackout occurs because during theactual separation process, the physical brain is unable to interpret the experience. Or, perhaps the braincan interpret the experience, but for some reason or another, the portion of the brain that is responsiblefor memory in unable to function.Despite the theories, I have experienced OBEs in which there was no lapse of consciousness during thechap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (2 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"separation process and OBEs in which there was no blackout during reentry. The first time this happenedwas on my fifth OBE:01/01/80 Tue - OBE #5...I looked at my astral hands. They were gently waving back and forth....I thought mywaving must be interfering with my travels. I slowed myself down. It felt like I was drawncloser to the physical body. I felt more physical. Then I dropped into my body andimmediately opened my eyes (no blackout). [There was] no split-second ofunconsciousness. I was fully conscious the whole time. I gently floated down [into thebody]. I felt myself become more solid. I immediately took charge of the physical body andopened my eyes, wide awake....In my 54th OBE, I was fully conscious for the entire exit and reentry:10/31/81 Sat - OBE #54...I got really comfortable, and started to \"mind-sway\" myself gently. I was extremelyrelaxed, and my mode of thought was perfect: PASSIVE.I went deeper toward the unconscious state, but I never got there. I felt a strangeelectrical-type of sensation one third of the way up my spinal column. I also became alert,and at the same time I became restless. I was on my back but [my back was] curved aroundmy pillow, and I felt uncomfortable with that position. I turned over so that I was on mystomach, but I felt that my body didn't move with me! Only my astral body turned! I didn'tlet this bother or excite me, because I knew that the separation process was not finished. Iknew I was half in and half out of my body.I also knew what I had to do next [to finish the process]. I gently and carefully pushedmyself down a little bit, away from my body; About one inch of me was out. I instinctivelyknew that the vibrations would come to me then. Sure enough, the vibrations came filteringdown into my head from above. When the vibrations were at their peak, I took [that as] mycue, and lifted out of my body, twisting at the same time so that I was heading for mybedroom door. I mentally noted how clear my consciousness was again. When I got to thebedroom door, I looked and realized that my astral self was curved around an astral pillow,just like my physical body was curved around its pillow. I reached over with my astral righthand, and tried to pull the pillow away. That is when I noticed that I was dressed in the sameclothes as my body--my pajamas. I pulled on the pillow, but it wouldn't come free.I got frustrated and turned so that I was facing west. I was going to look at my body to thenorthwest, but I stopped turning when I looked to the west and saw some lights. I tried tolook at the lights and study them, but I noticed that my sight was strange. Everything lookedas if it was tilted back 45 degrees. It was as if my astral body was leaning at a 45-degreeangle. I wanted to see those lights better, so I tried to upright myself. But no matter howhard I tried, I was still at a 45-degree angle. It was like I was halfway between lying downand standing up. I thought to look at my physical body, but when I thought about my body, Iimmediately went into it without getting a chance to look at it.I was now semi-physical in my body, and I made a great effort to stay awake. I kept sayingchap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (3 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"to myself, \"I will stay conscious.\" Then I thought that if I opened my eyes again it wouldhelp me stay awake. So with a great effort, I opened my eyes and everything was blurry. ButI was awake. Then it seemed like I was in the cataleptic state. Very, very slowly my sightbecame more \"real\" until I was fully back in my body. I was fully physical again. When Irolled over and looked at the clock it was 9:35am, so I estimate the projection to havestarted around 9:30am.Here is another example:09/18/82 Thu - OBE #81...Then the vibrations swept into me, and I was cataleptic. I tried to move, but I couldn't. Istruggled to get away from my body but I couldn't. I opened my eyes. I could look around,but could not pull away from my body. My astral body was obviously separate from mybody, and it felt free. I felt weightless, and yet I couldn't move. After trying to roll out of mybody to the right and was unsuccessful, I looked at my bookcase. I looked around somemore. Then I went to try to roll out to the left. Then I noticed a blur of red to my left. It wasmy clock, with a digital red display. I had heard that some people believe that time movesdifferently while out of body, so I tried to look at my clock. The clock was just barely out ofmy field of vision; my body was pointing straight up. So I tried to turn my head.After a great deal of effort, I managed to turn my head to the left. It was very hard to turn.But as my head turned, my whole being solidified. I was turning my physical head. With nobreak in consciousness, I felt my whole being getting bound into my physical body. By thetime I finished moving my head, I was no longer astral, but I could see the time: 9:30am.I've had many more fully-conscious exits than reentries, for a simple reason: I usually try to make myOBEs last as long as possible, so I don't let the experience end until I black out or lose consciousness.We may never know why the blackout usually occurs. Perhaps science will discover the reason, but notuntil the OBE is given serious scientific research.IV. Pain During an OBE.I have learned some interesting things about pain while I was out of my body. All the OBE books saidthat during an OBE it was impossible to feel pain. They said only the body feels pain. So I was verysurprised when I had the following experience:04/26/80 Sat - OBE #14I entered my astral body and suddenly felt a pressure at my astral rib cage on both sides, asif someone were poking me there! I couldn't stand the tickle/hurt feeling and, as if I werebeing tickled, I twisted and put myself back into my body. Once in my body I felt all right.I left the body again and the same thing happened! I tried to ignore the poke-pressure, butwas overcome [with the pain] and had to go back again.I was determined. I tried again. I swayed my astral legs once again. This time I noticedsomething strange. I didn't use my eyes nor my astral eyes, but I could feel my astral limbschap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (4 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"with my mind! I could also see them partially with my mind's eye, just like visualizing athought! This time I also noticed my astral arms. When I got out, I wiggled my fingers.Again, I felt the tickle-pain in my rib-cage on both sides. It wasn't as bad this time, and Ialso did a better job of ignoring it and withstanding the pain. I felt a hand grab my rightwrist. It gently tried to help me away from my body, but once again the pain-tickle took itstoll and I had to return to my body. When I came back to my body for the third time, Isuddenly became very dizzy, and had to abandon the attempts....This experience was the only one in which I felt \"pain\" in the true sense of the word. As I described, itfelt as if someone were poking me in the rib-cage very hard.I didn't get around to actually experimenting with OBE-pain until 1983:01/09/83 Sun - OBE #86...I clapped my hands in front of me as hard as I could. It made a sound, just as I hadexpected. I had hit my hands very hard, and I felt the pain in them for a second, but the painwas a painless-pain! I clearly recognized the sensation of pain in my hands, but I swear itdidn't hurt!I've experienced this painless-pain or mock-pain several times. For instance, instead of floating up abovemy body on one occasion, I decided to float down under my body:04/27/80 - OBE #15Sometime this morning I found myself conscious out of my body, but very near it. My firstinstincts were to get away from it. So when I thought about getting away, I drifted down,through my bed underneath my body. I could feel the bed as I went through it.What I experienced was the sense of thirty or forty bedsprings piercing through my astral body as I wentdown beneath my body. The sensation wasn't painful, but I did feel the dull, throbbing sense ofmock-pain.In another OBE, I very much expected to feel pain, but I didn't:05/25/84 Fri - OBE #109I woke up astrally. I had been dreaming that something was attacking me on my left side. Iwoke up [in the astral body] and found myself swinging my right astral arm wildly hitting atthe imaginary attacker on my left side. Although I was hitting my left side as hard as Icould, I didn't feel any pain at all. I became fully conscious and continued to swing my arm,but only to gather momentum to swing away from my body. Soon I blacked out.The subject of astral pain, especially unexpected lack of pain, may very well be another way to clearlytell OBEs apart from dream states.chap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (5 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"V. Making the Body Move During an OBEThe books I read on out-of-body experiences led me to believe that it was impossible to move thephysical body during an OBE. I found out that it might be difficult, but possible.Several times I have apparently forced my body's eyes open during an OBE, yielding some interestingresults. I have written more about that in the next chapter.Although I have no way to prove it, I have apparently made my body move in other ways during a fewOBEs. For example:11/08/80 Sat - OBE #25...I started myself astrally swaying again. I tried moving my feet, and my physical onesmoved! They felt very heavy. The foot I moved was not the swaying astral limb, but thephysical one, and I could sense it move with my mind-vision. About then I blacked out andcame back....I have also apparently made my body speak during an OBE. For example:10/04/81 Sun - OBE #51...I was really in my astral body again, stuck to my physical body. I tried to say, \"It's just notfair,\" but I couldn't! So I tried to telepath it, and I heard it faintly in my inner hearing.Disappointed that I couldn't \"say\" it physically, I tried very hard again. Then I heard my[physical] voice say it, but the voice sounded distorted, as if someone said it for me. Or as ifthe transition from the physical sounds to the astral sounds made it sound squeaky, distorted.I've also had OBEs during which I've put all my energy into trying to make my body speak, withoutsuccess. Again, only scientific experiments can prove whether a person can affect his body during anOBE.VI. OBE MythsThere are many myths about the out-of-body experience passed down through the ages, many of whichcause people unnecessary concern.A. State of health:Some books on OBEs say that OBEs are easiest when the subject is in perfect health. Other books saythat OBEs are easiest when the body is physically weak, sick or exhausted.I've had OBEs in sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer, for better and for worse, till death do Ipart! Most of my experiences were done in good health, but as a rule, my body's state of health hasn'taffected the experiences, nor my ability to induce the experience.B. Lying on your stomach.Many books caution the reader not to attempt an OBE while lying on their stomach. At first I had somechap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (6 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"concern about it, but the concern was short-lived:04/05/81 Sun - OBE #38...I rolled over onto my stomach. I headed off to sleep. I wanted to project, but I was too lazyto make any effort. I was almost asleep when I found myself waving. I thought, \"Good. NowI can project.\" So I increased the waving. I was almost ready to come out of my body when Ithought, \"Wait. I read that you're not supposed to project while on your stomach. Maybe Ishouldn't.\" Then the waving slowed down. I thought, \"Maybe I should turn over.\" Then Ithought, \"No! That might ruin the whole attempt. I should take the opportunity while I stillhave it.\" So I started waving again. The waving got big enough, and I went up out of mybody....I've projected many times while lying on my stomach, and never had any problems or discomforts fromdoing so.C. Attempting to have an OBE with your legs crossed:Many OBE books caution their readers against attempting to have an OBE with their arms or legscrossed, or their body in any unusual positions. Supposedly, there is a danger of blocking the flow ofenergy in the body, which could possibly harm the physical body or astral body. Some books claim it'sdifficult for the astral body to leave the physical body in strange positions.I've left my body in many unusual and awkward positions, and there have been no bad side effects.It is important that your body be comfortable and relaxed during OBEs, and if you are comfortable andrelaxed in an awkward-looking position, don't hesitate to use it. I would, however, recommend usingonly positions that allow good blood circulation. When some people sleep, they look like a squashed ant,or like an airman whose parachute didn't open on time. My general rule is this: if you can sleep in such aposition, it is safe to leave your body in that position.Some body positions do make it easier to leave the body. I've found that when I lie on my sides, I amsometimes too comfortable and therefore fall asleep instead of leaving the body. When I lie on my back,it seems easier to control my state of consciousness.D. Usage of Energy During OBEsI've often had people ask me if I came back to my body feeling drained. Not surprisingly, several bookson OBEs claim that the experience requires a great deal of energy, and is therefore rare and difficult toachieve.My experience has been just the opposite. I've never come back to my body feeling drained of energy.Rather than being tired, I return to my body feeling refreshed and happy. When I return to the body, I'moften exhilarated because the experience was so exciting and uplifting.Although there have been many myths and legends about the out-of-body experience, there is still muchto be learned. There is only one way to break through the barriers of fear, superstition and prejudice thatkeep us from broadening our knowledge and expanding our consciousness: to test the myths, to exploreour outer limits and to bring that information out in the open.chap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (7 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"EXERCISE 17Head RockingSit up straight (not leaning back), close your eyes, and very gently and slowly start nodding your head,\"yes.\" Don't analyze any of this, just try to feel that rocking sensation. Memorize that feeling of gentleswaying. Pretend that your whole astral body is also swaying just like your physical head is swaying.There is a point where your head is balanced front to back, and if you nod your head with your eyesclosed, you will probably lose that balance and feel slightly disoriented.Do this several times at different practice sessions, spending at least a full minute each session. As avariation, try moving your head in small circles instead of nodding.This exercise is good for many reasons. First, it will get you used to the feeling of being disoriented.OBE exercises can sometimes leave you disoriented. Becoming familiar with that feeling makes it easierto handle. Second, if you memorize this feeling of rocking, you'll be able to trigger the pre-OBE stateeasier, which may have its own rocking sensations.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap17.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap17.html (8 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:20:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18Fight for SightScientific experimenters were quick to discover that OBE eyesight is different from physical eyesight.They set up a simple experiment: They placed an object inside a locked room. The subject was supposedto fly into that room and identify the object. The experiment sounds easy enough, but the subjects hadproblems identifying the objects. The most proficient subjects, such as Ingo Swann and Keith (\"Blue\")Harary could make drawings of what they saw during OBE experiments. Often the drawings wereunrecognizable, or at best distorted. For example, in one experiment part of the \"target\" was an Americanflag. Ingo Swann made a very impressive and accurate drawing of the target. However, the flag wasdrawn as a rectangle with a box in one corner and stripes on the rest of the rectangle. Ingo seemed to seethe flag with some clarity, but was unable to identify it as an American flag. Why do such distortionsexist?In an attempt to tell whether some sort of clairvoyance was involved during OBEs, parapsychologistsdevised an ingenious experiment. They built an optical box that was computer- controlled. The computerwould choose a random colors, quadrants, and patterns. The colors and patterns were displayed in thechosen quadrant. The displayed image could only be identified if the subject was standing in a certainposition in front of the box, where he or she could interpret the superimposed images as a single image.The complexity of the superimposed visual images was meant to rule out clairvoyance. This experimenthad a very small rate of success, but sometimes the target was \"seen,\" as if the subject was actuallyviewing the box from outside his or her body. But this experiment also had many problems with theeyesight being distorted. Again, why is this?I believe the distortions in astral eyesight are partly due to the fact that the astral body isn't equipped witheyes which process light. Astral eyes are more for appearance than function. Therefore, the physicalbrain is forced to give physical interpretations to nonphysical \"images.\" Many of my experiments weredevoted to exploring the astral equivalent of eyesight.I. The different types of sight:I've experienced four basic types of sight during my out-of-body experiences. I call them astral sight,body-sight, mind-sensing and clairvoyance. Of course, there is a fifth category: no sight at all. OBEs cansometimes be very difficult to describe because during the experience you may have switched severaltimes among the four types of sight. One moment you might be mind-sensing, and the next minute youuse your astral-sight to look at a particular object, and so on.A. Astral SightAstral sight is best explained as the astral equivalent of physical sight. A good example is OBE #52 inchapter 10. This type of sight is closer to in-the-body physical sight than the other types. With this typeof sight, objects seen while out of the body may look just like they do while in the body. This is the mostdesirable type of sight because it is easier for the physical brain to interpret the images seen during theOBE. The sight is focused at the astral body's eyes and objects usually appear solid. Usually I have tochap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (1 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"make a special effort to employ this type of sight, and I've noticed that my peripheral vision isn't verygood. Here is an example from my journals:01/25/81 Sun - OBE #31...Now I was fully conscious. I remembered my sight problem, and decided to look at mywaving arm, not sure if it was physical or astral. I looked over, and I saw my arm waving. Itseemed to be physical sight. I felt sure I was in my physical body, trying to push myself out.Then I blacked out and woke up in my physical body and found out I had been wrong. Iwasn't in my physical body when I thought I was. My physical arm was wedged betweenmy legs, so the arm I saw waving was my astral arm. I had been seeing the astral counterpartof the physical world....The following example illustrates another important point: eyesight (among other things) is affected byour beliefs and our thoughts.02/23/80 - OBE #9...I looked up about 30 degrees and I didn't see my bookshelf, etc. I saw a gray area, almostas if it were a time-tunnel, like the old television show. But it was like a gray cloud.... Thestrangest thing I find about the astral plane is how astral sight works. It's like a truer \"tunnelvision.\" You see only where you look, and then only what you expect or want to see. I didn'tsee any of the surroundings of my physical room. For example, I didn't see my dressers orbookshelf, but I could see my own astral body when I expected to see it. OBE #5 alsoinvolved the strange sense of sight. [During that experience] I saw the physical pillow, hand,etc., but not my astral hands. When I wanted to see what they were doing, I looked out infront, and slowly the VISION of them swaying gently back and forth FADED IN. Theyslowly got clearer until I could recognize that they were my hands....B. Astral Mind-SensingAstral mind-sensing is the type of eyesight that I've experienced most often during my OBEs. This isn'tmuch like true eyesight at all. You can't actually \"see\" things, but you can \"feel\" with your mind whereeverything is. This type of sight isn't centered around astral eyes. Objects are \"felt\" in all directionssimultaneously, by the whole focus of consciousness. This type of sight is very hard to interpret ordescribe in physical terms. With this type of sight, you can flawlessly navigate a cluttered room but not\"see\" any particular object in the room. Here are a few examples:08/15/80 - OBE #21Sometime during the night I woke up in my astral body, gently swaying inside the physicalbody. I swayed myself and was mildly surprised when my consciousness swayed too. So Iswayed myself harder until my astral feet touched the ground....I decided to try to wake upmy mother. So I struggled against the pull of my cord and walked through my door. I wentdown the kitchen hall and into my parents' bedroom. I saw both of their bodies sleepingthere. My dad's body was talking in his sleep. I looked again to see if their bodies glowedfrom their aura. I didn't notice any glow. I decided to wake my mother up. So I reached outand tried to rouse her by shaking her while saying, \"Wake up, Ma.\" She finally woke up andchap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (2 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"looked but didn't see me. I tried to get her attention but she finally got up and walkedthrough me!....Again, my vision [had been] funny; I had thought to look to see if I could see the glow oftheir auras, and had made a special effort to \"look\" at their bodies. I couldn't really see, but Icould sense things with my mind, sort of like radar. I could feel the presences of thingsalways, but had to make a special effort to \"see\" with eyes. I realized that at the time, and Imade a special effort to \"look\" so I could bring back a clear memory when I came back; themind-vision must be very hard to translate into physical terms by the brain.C. Body SightBody sight is very annoying. I never read about it happening, nor did I think it was possible until Iexperienced it. This happens when you try to open your astral eyes and your physical eyes open instead,giving you a completely different and confusing perspective. With this type of sight, you can only see inthe direction that the body's eyes are pointing. It is often out of focus. This resembles split-consciousness,except that your consciousness is still fully within the astral body. Here are a few examples from myjournals:11/29/80 Sat - OBE #27...I was out of my body, floating about four feet away from it. I realized at once that Icouldn't see, so I made an effort to open my eyes. At that exact moment, for a split-second Ihad dual-consciousness! I felt my physical body had opened its eyes! While at the same timeI was floating above the body, looking down! In other words, I was plainly in my astralbody, and I was looking down, but what I saw was from my physical body looking up! I gotreally confused, was shocked, surprised, whatever, and then I lost consciousness and starteddreaming....12/17/80 Wed - OBE #29...I was falling asleep when I noticed that I had two sets of arms! I had a lot of control, butmy consciousness was not too good. I forced myself down under my bed. I couldn't seeanything, nor was I \"mind-sensing.\" But I could feel my [astral] body fine, and I knewwhere I was. I immediately drew myself up to the ceiling. I didn't propel myself up there,nor did I exactly \"think\" myself up there. I just drew myself up to the ceiling in what seemedlike a natural manner. I still couldn't see. I tried to open my eyes, but it once again seemedas if my physical eyes opened, and I saw from my body's viewpoint. I recognized the dangerof this (I might have gotten confused like OBE #27). So I closed my eyes again.01/24/81 Sat - OBE #30...I was...about three inches below my physical body. I opened my eyes, and, although myastral self was swaying, my vision was not! I noticed that my sight was normal, and not theusual distorted astral vision, and I wondered why. Then it came to me. Once again, I wasseeing through my physical eyes! This has happened before, but now I decided toinvestigate the matter further. It didn't make sense that I was seeing through my physicalbody's eyes. I decided to try to figure it out. I reached out my (astral) hand in front of mechap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (3 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"and my face. I looked through my physical eyes, and saw nothing but the ceiling and theoverhead light. My physical body wasn't seeing my astral arm, which I plainly felt as beingright in front of my physical eyes. I didn't feel any discomfort, but I thought my physicaleyes had been open a long time, and they needed blinking. So I blinked them, and it was anormal blink. I did it again. When I blinked, for that split-second, it seemed as though myastral head floated up to meet my physical head. Then when I blinked I felt my head asbeing physical, although my astral legs were still dangling. Well, I decided that it wouldremain a mystery. I decided to go do something, so I pulled myself up about five feet abovemy body. I also closed my eyes so they wouldn't disturb me....D. Clairvoyance\"Clairvoyance\" is the term I use to define a whole grab-bag of different types of sight, such as seeingauras and receiving images of people and places that aren't present. I believe that \"remote-viewing\"mainly uses this type of sight, which used to be called \"traveling clairvoyance\" years ago. I believeanyone can learn to use this type of sight, whether out of the body or in, with practice. Here are a fewexamples from my OBE journals:10/24/81 Sat - OBE #52...I was off to another excursion. When I got out, I was about one foot above my body. I satup. I knew what I must do. I had to get to LD's house somehow. I thought to myself, \"Iknow there are two possible routes I could take, either the back door or out through mywindow.\" But I heard the back door open and shut. I directed my attention over there, andmy clairvoyant vision opened up. I saw that it was my mom coming in from outside. I alsonoticed the clock in the kitchen, but it was too blurry to see the time. I remember that it wasmore like second-sight or clairvoyant vision....05/15/82 Sat - OBE #73...I looked down at my swaying legs, but all I saw was my bed. I saw no legs. I thought,\"Well, now is the best time to practice clairvoyant vision because I know what to look for[my legs].\" So I half closed my astral eyes, and put them out of focus. I experimented withmy eyes, and finally after about six tries I found how to hold my eyes so that they would getthe clearest clairvoyant sight [of my legs]. I cannot possibly describe any more how I usedmy eyes to see that way; it is something that can only be gained through experimenting.Anyway, I was seeing clairvoyantly, and I clearly saw two identical sets of legs. One set [thephysical] was resting on the bed. The other set [the astral] was swaying up and down, andthe physical bed wasn't affecting it in the least. I feel now that I was actually usingclairvoyant sight or \"second sight\" because I noticed a difference between it and the usualastral sight. The astral sight I am used to usually doesn't give me great detail. In thisprojection I saw my legs, the pajamas I was wearing, and the exact design on those pajamas.Ordinarily when I look at my legs astrally I either see them as bare legs, or I see clothingvaguely. In this [mode of] vision I also noticed many other details. The neatest thing wasbeing able to see both sets of legs there. Both sets of legs looked semi-transparent, and Icould distinguish color very well.07/25/82 Sun - OBE #80chap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (4 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"...I looked at my [astral] arms, not astrally, but clairvoyantly, as if trying to see a spirit fromthe physical world. My [astral] arms were transparent when I looked at them that way. Theylooked like transparent, dark black filmy shadows. I studied them for a while, then blackedout.II. Peculiarities of Sight.Astral travelers have always reported differences between the physical world and the OBE world. Forinstance, a door that is closed physically might appear open while out of the body. Why are theredifferences? The most common explanation is that we aren't really seeing the physical world: We areseeing the astral counterpart of the physical world. It is said that the astral world is very plastic and whenleft alone, it molds itself to the shape of physical objects. I've also seen some peculiar things while out ofthe body:A. Seeing the physical body.What is it we're seeing while we're out of the body? If we're seeing only the astral counterpart of physicalobjects, it follows that we should not be able to see our own body. After all, we are already using theastral body. I haven't looked at my physical body much during OBEs, but when I do it usually looks likea blob of gray. However, it hasn't always appeared as I expect:04/27/80 - OBE #15Sometime this morning I found myself conscious out of my body, but very near it. My firstinstincts were to get away from it. So when I thought about getting away, I drifted down,through my bed underneath my body. I could feel the bed as I went through it. I saw mybody through the bed as a body-shaped mass of gray matter. I thought, \"No, I don't want togo down. I want to go up.\" Then I drifted up above my body to the ceiling. I started to driftthrough the ceiling, and I could feel the layers go through my arms and head. It was sostrange!When I was halfway through the ceiling, I was sensing things with my mind and not usingmy astral sense of sight. I thought, \"I'm supposed to see what's up here (above my room).\"So I quickly turned my head to look, saw some stuff like a dresser flash by my sight and thenext thing I knew I was back in my body.01/31/81 Sat - OBE #33...I could see okay on the astral plane. I was in the high-vibration state, swaying. I was alsoabout five inches below my physical body. My physical body from the astral plane lookedlike a ghost might on the physical plane. It looked to me to be a transparent shell in theshape of a man, with nothing in the middle....01-15-84 Sun - OBE #101...At that time I realized that my eyes were closed and I really wasn't seeing anything at all.My vision was totally dark. So I opened my astral eyes and turned around to look back atmy body. The room looked normal. I could see everything in it. I looked at my bed and itchap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (5 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"looked just like it should: all messed up. But there wasn't a body on it that I could see! Itried squinting, but I still didn't see my body. I did notice that the bed linen was flattened, asif there was some object on it, but the object was totally and completely invisible. I thought,\"Oh that's interesting. I wonder why I can't see it.\" I closed my eyes and tried to turn onclairvoyance. I could barely mind-sense my body as a filmy, gray shadow on the bed. I justthought, \"Hm. Oh well,\" and decided to go do something....B. Astral clouds.During several experiences I noticed clouds of gray hanging in midair. I still don't know what they are orwhy they exist. It seems to be undefined astral matter.C. Astral lights.During a few OBEs I noticed a strange light that I could not explain. As far as I know, this is notcommon in OBEs, but many people have reported seeing similar lights during near-death experiences(NDEs). Here are some examples from my journals:12/20/79 Thu - OBE #4...strong vibrations came. I stayed calm. They \"took over.\" I came out of my body about fourfeet away. I saw a bright light to the west. I was halfway through my wall between mybedroom and the living room. I looked back and saw my body. I was then slowly drawntoward it. I thought, \"No! I'm not done! I want to go to JP's house! I want to go to JP andCA! I want to go!\". I was sucked partially in my body. I kept part of me out. I could moveboth bodies (astral and physical). My arms were astral, but my eyes were both astral andphysical! I waved my left arm right in front of my face and looked through my physicaleyes. I couldn't see them! I could feel them there but I couldn't see them. I wanted to seethem, so suddenly I did. I could partially move my other limbs. I decided to go back [andend the experience]....03/07/82 Sun - OBE #66...I looked and I saw a tiny, but concentrated, pinpoint of bright light to the West, and up alittle bit. I was intrigued by it, and I stared at it. It didn't seem to be a physical light. I triedfocusing my eyes in a number of different ways to try to see it more clearly. I tried to look atit with physical sight, astral sight, mind-sensing, and many other forms of sight. I tried tomagnify it in my vision. I don't know why I was so fascinated with it. I started staring at italmost hypnotically. I wondered if it had anything to do with my body, or if I was wakingup. Then I felt my consciousness slowly transported back to my physical body and I wasstill quite loose from my body. I started swaying again, but I felt all of my senses comeslowly back to my body. The swaying became slower and slower, then finally stopped, and Icame to.D. Misc.Sometimes I've seen things that didn't make any sense:chap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (6 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"06/27/82 Sun - OBE #76...My eyes opened and I astrally saw a very blurry sight that did not make sense. This lastedfor a split-second, and it was followed by another picture that was very clear, but it was veryshort in duration. This second sight [vision] looked like a square rainbow, or a squarerepresentation of the spectrum of light. I could see nothing but gray around this box ofcolors. In this box, leftmost, was a bigger block of pure black. To the right of the blackportion were six or so other colors that were either in the order of the rainbow(red-orange-yellow-green-blue-violet) or in reverse order(violet-blue-green-yellow-orange-red). I remember it clearly. This box of colors was to theright [side] of my field of vision. Anyway, this vision faded, and I again saw the blurry firstvision. Then I felt a tremendous electrical shock hit my system, as if I stuck my finger in alight socket and received a full 110-volt electrical shock. This shock hit every cell of mybody and I was slammed back to my body. My heart was beating wildly, beyond control, asif the shock was physical....Through practice, it is possible to learn to control out-of-body vision. I recommend you experiment withthe different types of sight to see what works best for you. I recommend using a form of sight that can beexpressed in physical terms when you return to your body and want to record the experience.III. Objectivity of SightMany books on out-of-body experiences claim that OBEs are completely controlled by our thoughts,beliefs, expectations and wishes. But if this is true, how \"real\" is it? Where does it fit in with ourexperience of the \"real\" or \"objective\" world? If you leave your body and travel to Jupiter, and believethe planet is blue instead of orange, will you see a blue Jupiter or an orange one? In either case, are youreally seeing the \"real\" planet, or one which was created in your mind? This is a very perplexing questionthat deserves more attention.There are many people who have reported OBEs in which they saw things that really did happen. Themost common of these are the descriptions by patients undergoing surgery, who claim to have witnessedthe whole procedure from outside their body. Some have reported details of the procedure that they couldnot have possibly known, such as where the doctors put gall stones that were removed. Some patientshave accurately repeated conversations that went on during the surgery. Skeptics may dismiss such casesby theorizing that some subconscious part of the patient still had cognitive abilities during the operation,and assuming that somehow the patient accessed this subconscious memory when they awoke. Thistheory cannot explain the less common cases where OBE subjects have reported what was happening in adifferent room. These seem to suggest that the subject could actually see some part of physical reality.There are also many cases where people saw things during an OBE that didn't correspond to the physicalworld. For instance, take the following OBE:12/21/85 Sat - OBE #119I brought myself down into the proper mental state, very easily, and I got out of my bodyusing an older technique: I waited for a certain feeling in the pit of my stomach, moved myconsciousness down to my abdomen, then lifted myself straight up at that place, and out ofthe body. It all happened very quickly and it seemed ridiculously easy at the time.chap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (7 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"I was in midair floating about two feet above my physical body. I turned to my left (South),and raised myself into a standing position. I looked at the North wall, and briefly consideredwhether to walk through it. I decided against it.I took a few steps toward the back of the bedroom, to the West. I felt a bit giddy and offbalance. Then I took a few steps East, toward the bedroom door again. I felt unsure of myfooting, and I assumed it was because I was too close to my physical body. I decided that Ihad to get farther away from my body, and the safest way to do that was to crawl on myhands and knees.I got down on my hands and knees, and crawled toward the bedroom door, crawled throughthe bedroom door, and out into the living room. I crawled about six feet more until I was inthe middle of the living room, and then stood up again, and walked over toward the kitchen.I looked into the kitchen, and it looked different. At the time I was standing partiallythrough the microwave oven stand, but I didn't notice it, nor any of the other nearby objectsin the room. I looked toward the countertop right of the sink, and there was no countertop! Itappeared as if someone had cut out the countertop at the sink, all the way back to the wall,and the wall looked somewhat dirty. It looked as if whoever cut the countertop out did avery sloppy job. I scanned the area up and down, and finally I said to myself, \"It's anillusion; I know the kitchen isn't like this, but that's not important.\"I walked back into the living room, stopped by JH's computer, and suddenly I became veryexcited. I said aloud (or so it seemed), \"This is great! I'm completely lucid! This is entirelyreal!\" I examined my own consciousness, and it was very clear, bright, lucid, and normal inevery respect....Why are there discrepancies between the physical and nonphysical worlds? Some people claim that astralmatter is easily malleable, and imitates physical objects, but not completely. Others claim it's becausesome OBEs occur in the \"astral plane\" which is influenced by our beliefs and expectations. Or perhapsthe people who find themselves in a thought-influenced, subjective OBE state are really having LucidDreams.Another theory is that some people have a kind of \"clairvoyance\" which allows them to see the physicalworld during an OBE, much like a clairvoyant can see spirits while in the body. Again, more research isneeded to answer these questions.EXERCISE 18Rocking Chair VisualizationThis is a variation of the previous exercise.Before you attempt the exercise, sit in a rocking chair, close your eyes and rock. Memorize the feeling ofrocking with your eyes closed. This is how you should feel when you are doing the exercise.chap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (8 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"You can do this either laying down or sitting. First, close your eyes and relax. As vividly as you can,imagine that you're sitting in a rocking-chair, rocking gently forward and backward. Take your timedoing this. In this exercise, it's not important to visualize at all. As a matter of fact, you can completelyignore any visual images that come to mind. In previous exercises, I wanted you to vividly pretend youwere seeing images, like the yoyo exercise in chapter 9. This time, I want you to vividly imagine thefeeling of rocking back and forth. Keep at it until it seems as if your consciousness is really rocking.Once again, this is more than just a silly exercise. I've used this imaginary feeling of rocking to leave mybody. Actually, I used a slight variation, which went as follows: Some good movie-theaters have seatslike a rocking-chair, but they have very tight springs. The tight springs make them more \"springy\" thanregular rocking chairs, and they rock very quickly. Anyway, I would imagine I was sitting in one of thesespringy theater seats and start rocking. Pretty soon the vibrations would come, and I'd use the momentumto catapult away from the body.Again, this exercise is very important. It's probably more effective for me than some of the otherexercises, because it deals directly with feelings and bodily sensations instead of visualizations orimaginary sounds.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap18.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap18.html (9 of 9) [5/4/1999 9:20:50 AM]"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19The Mind During OBEsSome researchers have theorized that the problems encountered in visual experiments are not problemswith vision, but rather problems with the mind and its interpretation of those images. Obviously, we canlearn a lot about our reality and ourselves if we examine our own mind and consciousness during OBEs.ConsciousnessHow is out-of-body consciousness different from normal consciousness? My experiments have led me tobelieve that out-of-body consciousness is very focused and directed. This single-mindedness makes iteasier to induce the experience, and usually stays with me during the experience. This focus also makes iteasier to remember details of an experience. It can also be a hinderance, because it's tempting to divertyour full attention to some small distraction during the experience, rather than doing something that youhad planned. For instance, several times I induced an OBE with the hope to astrally visit a friend, butoften I would become distracted and forget my goal.I have experienced many frames of mind and states of consciousness during OBEs. Usually, myconsciousness is completely normal in all respects. At times my consciousness is very strong, and I feelmore awake and aware than in normal life. But sometimes my consciousness feels very weak. I've oftenused the analogy between consciousness and a light bulb that is on a dimmer switch. Chapter 10, OBE#52 gave a fairly good idea of how consciousness operates during an OBE. Here are some moreexamples:05/23/82 Sun - OBE #74...Then something happened that might be difficult to describe. It seems like myconsciousness dimmed to the point where I couldn't organize memories. The memory I haveis of time standing still. I remember tiny flashbacks of things happening, but they all seemedto have happened at once. I remember seeing DB, and I remember him walking back andforth. He came toward me, then walked through me. Later, he opened the cabin door, andthe door went part-way through my astral body. I also feel I had some interaction with JPand CA. But my consciousness was so dim that I didn't have conscious control, and mymemory is so jumbled about that part that I can't say any more [for certain].05-02-83 Mon - OBE #94...I went to bed around 10:00pm. I tried to project for a little while, but I was just toomentally tired. I gave up and rolled over onto my right side to go to sleep, but I keptthinking about projection. I fell asleep almost immediately.The next thing I knew I was semiconscious and out of my body, in my bedroom. I wasstanding up when I noticed my condition. I examined my consciousness to see how wideawake I really was; I wanted to make sure I wasn't dreaming or deceiving myself in anyother way. I came to the conclusion that I was fully conscious in all respects. With thatchap19.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap19.html (1 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:21:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"thought, my consciousness brightened suddenly until I was more conscious and aware than Iam in waking life. I felt wonderful, alive, and vibrant, radiating with life and consciousness.I thought, \"Wow! Now this is consciousness, better and more real than I've felt before!\" AndI felt completely free from my body. I could tell it was very dark there in my bedroom, butmy eyesight was more astral than physical. I didn't hesitate to jump forward--throughphysical objects--to attempt flight. I closed my eyes, and I flew forward through my house,passing through walls and other physical objects as I gained speed. I felt each physicalobject as I passed through it, yet it didn't disturb me. I traveled so fast that I was out of thehouse in a few quick seconds. Once outside, I flew up and up, but I blacked out before I hada chance to do anything, or see where I was.Logical ThinkingOne of the things I try to examine during my OBEs is how \"normal\" my thoughts are. In most of myOBEs I seem to have normal, logical thoughts. Here are some examples:08/02/81 Sun - OBE #45...I woke up once at about 3:30am or 4:00am and went back to sleep. I dreamed that I was ina store at the University when I was called to a special counter. I received a phone call tocome home immediately because of a death in the family. I asked the woman, \"Who hasdied?\" She said she couldn't tell me. All she could tell me was the person's social-securitynumber. I talked to the woman a long time and had finally reasoned that it was my father(he's still alive). I was shocked and terribly sad. I decided to quit the dream.So I tried to wake up and I opened my eyes and saw unfamiliar surroundings. I was stiff andfelt paralyzed. My vision was weird too. I decided that I wasn't seeing truthfully. I didn'trealize that I was astral; a bit of grogginess still hindered my thoughts. So I tried toremember where I should be and what I should be seeing. I decided I should be in bedlooking up and seeing my walls with posters and the ceiling. My vision blurred away. Whenit returned, I saw my posters and all, but there was strange piece of woodwork that doesn'texist in my room. \"This isn't quite right either!\" I reasoned that I could probably projecteasily (I still didn't know I was nonphysical).Then I thought of the dream. If my father had just died, I wouldn't want to project. I'd beafraid. At the thought of projecting, I started to sway away from my body. But I pulledmyself back because I wanted to think this situation through fully before I dared to leave mybody's vicinity.I reasoned further: \"This prospect of Dad being dead was only in a dream. Yet, if he is deadit is very possible that I would be informed of it in a dream. And if so, he may take the formof a ghost or leave a nasty astral shell about.\" I started to pull away from my body again onmy own. I pulled myself back. I decided not to try to project further, just in case. I lostconsciousness and woke up in my body after a few seconds of what seemed likenonexistence. I opened my eyes and saw how my room really looks and I felt my bodyagain. Then I changed my mind, but it was already too late. I noticed my entranced state ofmind though, and tried to project again with one near-success.chap19.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap19.html (2 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:21:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"I gained at least one good thing from this experience, and that is the knowledge of theproper state of mind conducive to astral projection. I wonder what causes this state of mindand body, and plan to read some books on sleep and the causes and effects of certain typesof sleep. I slept very deeply. My body was stiff and I couldn't feel it until I moved it andstretched. My mind was almost entranced. I was in a staring mood and found concentratingvery easy. It was very easy to focus my mind on one thought. It was semi-easy to visualize. Iprobably ruined my chance to project again when I moved my body and broke its stiffness.11/08/81 Sun - OBE #55...[During the experience] my consciousness was again very clear and concise, but I was stillvery sleepy. I thought about doing some experimenting. Then I decided to follow myoriginal plan of action: walk out of my house normally but as fast as I could, and then try tofly to LD's house. I thought of some parts of a song, and then I realized it [was typicalin-the-body thinking] and made a mental note to myself to remember that my thoughtpatterns are the same there as they are on Earth....Here is another example of logical thinking during an OBE. Notice the use of logical deduction duringthis OBE:06/09/82 Wed - OBE #75...This morning at 6:00am I was dreaming happily. In one dream, I was outside mybedroom, and I looked in through the window. I saw something that frightened me, and putme in a state of awe. I don't remember what I saw, but I also thought I saw a blinding whitelight shining through my window. It seemed to be alive. The brightness didn't hurt my eyes.The white rays of light coming into my bedroom were like little beautiful fingers reachingout. At the sight of this (in a dream still) I let myself fall backward until I was on my back.The falling was very gentle, and I landed softly, weightlessly. I floated there for a fewseconds, and the dream changed. I had a deep level of awareness that told me that thedreams were all very important lessons, and I must watch them all. I don't remember any ofthe dreams now. This dream of projecting happened in the middle of the series of dreams Ihad to witness.When the dreams were through, a certain part of me expressed an interest in the projectionpart. I wanted to do that dream over. So I saw myself outside my room again. I turned andlooked again. Then I saw the sight in the window again. I fell over backward again. But thistime, when I landed on my back, I woke up. I was still in a weird state of consciousness, butI wasn't exactly dreaming. I had conscious control so I levitated myself until I was lying at aslant outside my bedroom. My body was rigid. I was looking west and my torso was parallelto my bedroom. I thought about how easy it was to levitate. I also noticed that the state I wasin seemed somehow different from normal projection. I thought, \"Wow! This is neat! Iwonder if it is really a projection; it feels so different.\" To test my theory, I bent my rightarm and put my right hand in front of my face. My logic was this: If I could see through myhand it was probably a normal projection, but if I couldn't see through it, it was probablydifferent. I fully expected to be able to see through my hand. But when I reached my handout in front of me, I could not see through it. It seemed (looked) solid. I thought, \"Boy, that'sstrange! What else could it be then? I suppose that really isn't a good test. I could still bechap19.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap19.html (3 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:21:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"projecting.\" Then I started thinking about something else. Then I was frightened half todeath when I heard my alarm clock go off. I was violently pulled back inside my body, and Icame to with a jolt. My heart was pounding wildly from the fright.EmotionsAre emotions any different while out of the body? Usually, my emotions are normal during OBEs. Evenmy sense of humor isn't lost during my OBEs. However, I had the following experience during which Iwas very emotional. I even became hysterical, for no apparent reason:01/30/82 Sat - OBE #62Last night I stayed up until 12:30am watching a late movie, and then I did some stretchinguntil 1:00am or 1:30am. I woke up early this morning and went back to sleep. After a whileI seemed to feel a tingling sensation, and I came to full consciousness. I knew I was about toproject, and I was aware of the vibrations at a certain level of consciousness. So I made aquick movement, and I sat up [astrally] wondering what I should do. Then I suddenly wasovercome with thoughts of my father who had died 17 days ago. I cried, \"Daddy!\" hoping tosee him on the astral plane. I was about two feet above my body, and I was mostly notseeing, but mind-sensing. I relaxed to a semi-reclined position in midair. I looked up in thecorner of my bedroom where I had thought I'd seen some movements. I was very emotionalfor some reason, and it was almost a panic state. I became hysterical soon, and I reached myarms out in front of me, hoping that my father or someone would take my hands and helpme away from my body. But I couldn't stand it. It hadn't even been one second of time[later], when I became completely hysterical, and I SCREAMED, \"DADDY!\" as loud as Ipossibly could, and with as much emotion as I have ever known in my life.The last thing I remember was that I looked hopelessly into the astral fog. Then I blackedout very completely and very deeply. The next thing I knew I was dreaming, two or morehours later. I have absolutely no memory of what happened between the time I blacked out,and started dreaming.It completely baffles me why I was so emotional, so hysterical during this experience. And Iwas impatient. Usually when I project I stay calm. But this time was just the opposite. I justdon't understand. All I can do is to explain my actual emotions during the experience. Isomehow wanted frantically for him to come to me, take my hands, help me away from mybody, and cradle me, and make me his child. I somehow couldn't wait, even a few seconds,for my dad to arrive. My final shriek was a frantic plea to him, to my guides, or to anyone tocome and just be with me. In a world where they are tangible and real and can be hugged--aplace where there is solidness to them.I really don't understand it. I feel completely different now, but those were my feelings atthe time.In comparison, the following OBE happened about a month later, in which I met and talked with mydeceased father. This time I was completely calm, rational and logical during the experience.03/02/82 Tue - OBE #65chap19.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap19.html (4 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:21:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"...I astrally projected last night and I talked to my dad who died less than two months ago. Ihad been flying, and woke up out of my body as I landed. My Dad was coming into view. Ilanded next to him. I couldn't see anything but him: There wasn't anything around for milesexcept blackness. He had a T-shirt on, and he looked very good. Here's what we said:Bob: Dad!Dad: Hi Bob. You guys a little preoccupied with my death, aren't you?Bob: Yeah, I guess so. What should I tell them?Dad: Tell 'em I love them. Tell Mom she shouldn't be so sad. It had to be this way.Bob: What about the direction of my life?Dad: Don't worry. Everything will turn out all right.We exchanged one more line (which I don't remember). Then I remember (vaguely) flyingfor many miles downward and over, until I was next to my body. I woke up right away. Ithought about it for a while, but I was overcome by sleep. I have dreamed about him before,and this was not a dream. First, there is always scenery in a dream, and there wasn't anythere. Second, in a dream I am watching myself do things against my conscious will. Butthere I was conscious. I didn't see myself because I was myself. And everything I did wasmy own conscious choice.The only thing I noticed about this projection was that I was strangely intellectual. I wasn'temotional, but had the feeling of a thinking mind. I didn't think to ask him any of a millionquestions I'd like to ask him. The lack of scenery makes me believe this incident took placeon the astral plane, if there is such a place.Right-brain/left brainDuring an out-of-body experience, is there some separation between the right and left hemispheres of thebrain? Which part of the brain interprets nonphysical experiences? Scientists have shown that one side ofthe brain (usually the left side) is more logical, mathematical and tends to put labels on the objects itsees. The other side of the brain is mainly used for aesthetics, emotions and things of an artistic nature. Ifthe OBE was strictly devoted to the right hemisphere, it would explain why Ingo Swann could see anddraw the American flag \"target,\" but did not label it as a flag. It would also explain some difficultypeople have identifying targets in OBE experiments.The following OBE seems to suggest that OBEs are to some degree interpreted by the right hemisphereof the brain, but we have the power to control our brain during the experience:04/13/85 Sat - OBE #112I went to bed at 2:00am and was woken by the telephone at 8:00am. When I went back tobed, I decided to try to have an OBE. I practiced until I felt tired, then I rolled over anddecided to try going to sleep with OBE on my mind. I fell asleep. I woke up a few times,rolled over, and went toward sleep thinking about OBE again.chap19.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap19.html (5 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:21:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Then at about 10:50am I became conscious, but I felt strange, and I thought I might be outof my body. I became fully conscious and decided I was out of my body.I lifted myself slowly into the air about two feet with my mind. I didn't notice anything inmy bedroom because my eyesight was strange, but when I was about three feet away frommy body, I noticed an object. The object was off in the distance and hanging in midair.I didn't recognize the object right away, but it was shaped almost like a human head: it waswhite, and it had dark prongs on top, as though the head was wearing a crown. I thought, \"Ican go anywhere I want now...but if I don't find out what that object is, it will bother me therest of my life.\" I stopped my forward motion and floated weightlessly in the air. I turnedtoward the white object and looked at it. It appeared filmy and transparent.At first I thought it was a materialized head with a crown, all made of ectoplasm, similar tothe objects and faces seen in \"spirit photography.\" I focused on it more and started to noticecertain details: the \"chin\" area was square. I became very determined to solve the mystery ofwhat it was, regardless of whether of not it was dangerous. I mentally pulled myself towardthe object and tried to focus on it more.I figured I was seeing it with my emotions, as if I were using the right side of my brain. So Itried to engage my intellect, or the left side of my brain [by solving mathematical problemsin my mind]. As I did this the object became clear--it was my nearest Aloe Vera plant,sticking out of its white pot. As it came into focus, the rest of the room also came into focusand I could see everything in my bedroom clearly.I decided to get up and walk out of my bedroom. I started to upright myself, and headedtoward the door. Then my consciousness became dim, and I was pulled into my body, and Icame to.The aloe plant, sitting in its white vase, was an everyday object in my bedroom. In waking life, I couldhave recognized it in an instant. However, at the beginning of the OBE, I could tell its size, shape andcolor, and yet I was unable to \"recognize\" it or see its texture. It seemed almost two-dimensional andwithout depth. I should also mention that there were two other aloe plants, in dark brown vases, sittingnext to the plant in the white vase. The three plants were sitting in a row on top of my dresser. Until myvision became clear, I only saw the one plant, and it looked as if it was hanging in midair.When I tried to purposely engage the left side of my brain by solving mathematical problems, the otherobjects in the room came into focus, and I recognized the plant for what it was.At face value, it seems that out-of-body experiences are profoundly affected by our usage of the right andleft hemispheres of the brain. Our OBEs may be valuable on a soul or spirit-level, but if our physicalbrain is unable to interpret the experiences in its own terms, we might not return to our bodies with muchof value. And we might not be able to describe the experiences to others. This right brain/left brain ideais very intriguing, and I feel it needs more investigation. This may lead us to discover why our brains aredivided into parts.chap19.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap19.html (6 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:21:12 AM]"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"EXERCISE 19Workout and Visualized BooksHere is an exercise to help you focus your consciousness.

Too much exercise will make you tootired, and you'll drop off to sleep. Too little exercise, and you are likely to be too focused inside yourbody.

I call it the \"Fantasy Trap,\" and it's caused by daydreaming in the OBE state. I can explainit best by giving an example from my journals:11/29/81 Sun - OBE #58...My consciousness was starting to get dim, so I wrestled with it for a while, and took holdof a clean, clear consciousness. I thought to myself how strange it was that my projectionwas lasting so long.I wanted to get away so strongly that I started to use my mind to pretend to go to places. Inessence, I started to fantasize. It was very much like the normal dream state.In the first fantasy I walked out into the living room. JP, CA, Mom, and Dad were there,talking. I walked out and sat down. I said something like, \"You can see me!\", then they said,\"Of course we can see you.\" Then I thought, \"This can't be right; I'm projecting.\"Just then I came out of it and came to realize I had been fantasizing. I was still stuck to mybody in the same position.I tried again to use my mind to get away and slipped into another fantasy. In this fantasy Iwalked up to my bedroom door, opened it and went through. I walked to the nearest windowand tried to walk through it. But it seemed very solid. So I very quickly went to the backdoor, ignoring everything else. I opened the door and walked outside. I went to the nearestclearing and jumped up into the air in a Superman pose. Then I fell flat on my face! Itseemed so very physical that I began to doubt I was projecting. I thought, \"Well, now I'vemade a complete fool of myself. I must be physical.\" I started walking toward the houseagain but I never got there. It was then I came to realize that I had been fantasizing again.I was dumbfounded by my own wishful-thinking fantasy. Then I was fully conscious andcompared the fantasies to my awakened state. I thought, \"Well, that use of my mind willonly lead me to self-deception. I should stick to getting away using my astral body.\" So Itried to pry my astral body free, and managed to get unstuck for a while. I crawled over tomy bedroom window and tried to press through it. I couldn't press through it; it seemedsolid. Just then I blacked out, and woke up in my physical body. I looked at the time and itwas 10:20am. My experience must have lasted 15 or 20 minutes.The Fantasy trap can be quite persistent and annoying, as you can see from the following example:04/16/83 Sat - OBE #93...I quickly discovered that I was now stuck to the physical body, and I struggled to get freeof it. I struggled for what seemed to be 10 or 15 minutes, using only my mind to try to freemyself.

I tried to pullmyself up to the ceiling, and tried to send my consciousness to the ceiling by imagining thepoint of view of looking down at my body. I got a brief \"clairvoyant\" image of my bodydown on the bed, but I didn't actually travel up there. I pondered the image for a while; Mybody looked rather beat. I wanted to float up and get a real look at it from my actual astralbody's point of view. I tried for a while longer to get free, but once again I lapsed intosemi-consciousness. After a long time of dreamlike short scenes, I finally snapped out of itagain, and I was still out of my body but stuck to it.I thought, \"I'm really out of my body!\" Then I said, \"Wow! I'm really projecting. I'm evenspeaking aloud while out of my body!\" Then the humor of what I just said, and the fact thatI was talking to myself, caught up with me and I chuckled aloud. I laughed a while longer,then set out to free myself again. This time I was sitting up, but was still stuck to the bodyby my lower half. I tried desperately to float myself up to the ceiling, but couldn't. Again, Istarted thinking hard about how to get free, but fell into semi-consciousness again. Afterseveral short scenes, I caught myself yet again.I was still out of my body, and this time when I woke out of it, I spent a few minutes\"comparing\" the two states of mind, the semiconscious [fantasy] state...and the pure-wakingout-of-body state where I had full awareness of everything. I thought about the differencesfor a while, and I finally resolved not to fall prey again to that delusive state ofsemiconscious OBE-mind. But after a few minutes, I fell back into it anyway.I awoke again, still out of my body and was surprised the experience was lasting so long; Itseemed like at least an hour since the initial jump out of my body. I also noted how easy itwas for me to fall into that semiconscious state, although I had made a firm resolution notto. So I perked up my consciousness, like I normally do to keep myself from sleeping [e.g.,while driving]. \"What should I do now?\" I thought, and I thought about it for severalminutes, and finally fell prey to semi-consciousness yet again! This time I did not catchmyself, but instead allowed my subconscious to take complete control.I entered the physical body while still semiconscious and I started to dream. I woke up inmy physical body when the telephone rang and it startled me considerably.I took great notice of another phenomena when I was first out of my body, and that was myheartbeat. Throughout the experience of leaving the body, I paid special attention to myphysical heartbeat. Just before I left the body, my heartbeat had slowed down considerably.It remained very slow until the vibrations hit me. With the coming of the vibrations and the\"trauma\" of leaving the body, my heartbeat sped up to a very rapid pace. It was as if I hadjust received a terrible fright and my heart was beating wildly from a \"fight or flight\"response. Once I was out of my body, I listened very carefully for my heartbeat. Although ithad slowed down again, it was still much faster than my normal waking heart rate. Afterthat, I didn't notice my heart rate; I was totally oblivious of my body.chap20.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap20.html (2 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:26:05 AM]"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Most of the OBE books say that you can travel in the blink of an eye, just by thinking about the person orplace you want to visit. Therefore, I would think about a place I wanted to visit, and I would visualizethat place, and imagine I was there.I learned this form of idle imagination can easily turn into an unproductive OBE-daydream. Instead ofbeing transported, the visualization takes on a life of its own and my consciousness slips into adream-fantasy state. The fantasy is entirely subjective, as far as I can tell, and can be as wild as anyordinary dream. But once the fantasy is over and my consciousness returns to normal, I know I've beendreaming.When I return to full consciousness, I may still be out of my body. Waking up out-of-body (andcomparing the former dream to the now-OBE state) convinces me that the OBE was real (objective) andthat the fantasy was not real (subjective).If you fall prey to the fantasy trap, there are certain clues that you are no longer in the proper state:Fantasy-objects (such as doors and windows) might seem solid, fantasy-people might see you, and yourfantasy-body might not be able to fly.If you wake up in-the-body from a dream-fantasy, you might be left with a sense of \"Was that just adream?\" I usually say something like, \"This is real!\" during OBEs so that I'll have a conscious point ofreference. Of course, I only say that after I examine my state of consciousness and detect that I am fullyaware during the experience. That way, I leave no doubts that I was conscious at the time, and notinvolved in a dream-fantasy.EXERCISE 20BreathingMany people claim that a key factor in inducing out-of-body experiences is breathing properly. FamousOBE researcher Robert Crookall devoted a book to the subject, called Psychic Breathing.Breathing exercises have many benefits. Deep breathing will help you to relax your body for the OBE.Breathing exercises, if done correctly, can bring you energy that may prolong the experience. Also, it canimprove your ability to focus. I recommend doing breathing exercises before you try to induce an OBE,and not during the induction.Here are some pointers for your breathing exercises. Babies breathe naturally because they haven'tlearned our bad habits. If you've ever watched a baby breathe, you may notice their bellies rise and fall,but their chests don't. They breathe using their abdomen, not by forcing their lungs to rise and fall. Try todo the same: Breathe from your abdomen, not from your lungs.During your breathing exercise, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you inhale,visualize that your lungs are being filled with white light. As you exhale, visualize that all your fears,worries, problems and health problems are flowing out of your body.Some people believe that visualizing a flow of energy can activate your chakras (energy centers) whichchap20.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap20.html (3 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:26:05 AM]"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"can help you achieve OBEs. In some forms of Taoist meditation, people are taught to visualize a streamof energy flowing in a circle that starts near the navel, travels down to the groin, up the spine, over thehead, down the chest and back to the navel. Kundalini yoga teaches a similar thing, but the energydoesn't flow in a circle, it flows out through the top of the head. I don't recommend the latter methodbecause some Taoists claim that it's dangerous to push the energy out your head.When you try to induce an OBE, just relax and let your breathing become normal again. Don't try tobreathe differently in any way. It may be helpful, however, to quietly listen to the sound of your ownbreath.During the OBE, it may suddenly seem as if you have stopped breathing. If this happens, don't bealarmed. Your body is still breathing, but you have lost awareness of the body.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap20.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap20.html (4 of 4) [5/4/1999 9:26:05 AM]"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21People and AnimalsPeople often ask me, do you ever meet anyone while you're out of your body? Yes, I have, but not often.Maybe 10 percent of my OBEs have had interaction with other people. There are two categories ofpeople you are likely to meet during an OBE: physical and nonphysical. A physical person is inside theirphysical body during your OBE. A nonphysical person can be someone who is also having an OBE, or aperson who is without a physical body--\"dead.\"When you meet someone on the astral plane, it's easy to tell if they are physical or nonphysical. Thephysical people usually seem preoccupied with trivialities. If you meet up with a physical person, theywill usually be busily preoccupied with reading, doing dishes or another physical activity. They don'tseem to notice you. You can speak with them, but usually they won't look at you while they speak,although sometimes it may seem as if they look at you. Physical people are always affected by gravity.Also, physical people usually have irregular or discolored auras.On the other hand, nonphysical people are not preoccupied. They usually notice you, and look at youwhen they are talking. They often wear out-of-place clothes. And they can be found perched in midair orjust about anywhere. Quite often in my experience, I've been able to hear or \"feel\" the presence ofdiscarnates, but haven't been able to see them. Also, their auras are mostly clear, regularly shaped andevenly colored.There may also be cases where nonphysical people don't seem to see you. A good example of this is OBE#116, mentioned in chapter 16, where I saw a group of people in my room, dressed in 1950's styleclothes. In these cases, I'm not sure if I am seeing spirits from a different \"wavelength\" or some sort ofpsychic afterimage.Physical PeopleIn Robert Monroe's first book, he believed that when we are speaking to a physical person, we are talkingwith their subconscious minds. He described elaborate conversations with people while out of the body,but when he went to verify the experience, nobody remembered the conversations. His theory seems tofit perfectly with my experiences. Talking to a physical person is strained, as if they are too preoccupiedto talk with you. Or perhaps their conscious minds feel uneasy having their subconscious talking with a\"spirit.\" It seems as if physical people are so focused on their daily lives that they feel uncomfortableturning any portion of their consciousness away from that focus. For example, during OBE #21mentioned in chapter 18, when I tried to rouse my mom from sleep, she just seemed to ignore me. Hereare a few more examples from my journals:05/02/81 Sat - OBE #39...I walked through the living room of JP's apartment and entered JP and CA's bedroom.Both JP and CA were in bed. CA was laying down with her eyes closed. JP was sitting up inbed with some reading material. I jumped up and down and waved my hands to try to getJP's attention. He looked up at me. Then he nudged CA and she stirred. He pointed at mechap21.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap21.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:25 AM]"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"and said, \"Look. I think there's something there.\" She looked, but didn't say anything. Ididn't want them to be afraid of me, so I said, \"It's me, Bob. I'm projecting.\" JP then said,\"It's probably Bob projecting,\" as though he didn't hear me. He went back to reading. I said,\"How can I be sure I'm going to remember this? What if I forget? I've got to remember.\" JPsaid, \"Don't worry, we'll remember for you.\" I said, \"How can I be sure you willremember?\" He said, \"We're awake. We should remember.\" I said, \"Okay, but I may stillforget.\" He said, \"Don't worry about it; you'll remember.\"When I asked JP and CA about this incident later that day, they didn't remember anything. JP wasreading at the time. CA was awake but doing various things around the apartment. Several times, shereclined on the bed to relax for a few minutes. Here's another example:07/30/81 Thu - OBE #44...Well, I turned around and saw my father sitting in a kitchen chair with a sad expression onhis face. I didn't want to speak, but I tried to get his attention by waving my hands in theplace he seemed to be staring. I was about six or seven feet away from him. He finallylooked up and said something like, \"Oh. Hello.\" I said, \"Hi! Look! I'm projecting!\" Withthat, I decided to continue on, not wanting to waste any projecting time; and Dad didn'tseem interested.Non-Physical PeopleThe experience quoted above happened when my father was alive. The following experience happenedafter his death:12/20/81 Sun - OBE #60...I twisted and reached for the window. I tried to pull myself toward it with my mind. Myconsciousness was dimmed again but this time I thought I saw a small boy of 12 or so [yearsold] watching me from the northeast upper corner of my bedroom (by my window). I felttwo or three older people that were on the other side of my bedroom wall. The boy saidsomething to me and then he talked with the older people for a while. I don't remember whatwas said. The boy had dark brown hair, sparkling eyes, and a grin that seemed to indicatethat he was pleased and adventurous because I was out of my body....The older people werestanding up. One was male, one female, and I didn't see the third well. These older peoplewere about 35 to 40 years old [in appearance] and were more serious [than the boy]. I onlybecame aware of these older people when they spoke to the boy and he answered. Just as Ilost consciousness I saw the boy slide down [what appeared to be] a ladder.In this OBE, there seemed to be several people watching me, and speculating about me. They seemed toknow me, as if they were my spirit guides, but I didn't consciously know any of them. The grinning boyseemed as if he were pleased with me. He acted lively and mischievous, with his big grin and sparklingeyes. However, none of them seemed to want to communicate with me. It was like they were scientistsduring an experiment, and I was the subject.chap21.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap21.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:25 AM]"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"AnimalsSome animals have more powerful senses than people. Dogs and cats can often see flying insects that oureyes miss unless we look closely. Animals also seem to be naturally psychic. I've talked to many peoplewho have said their pets exhibited unusual behavior, such as staring off into space or circling their headsas if they were seeing spirits. Those people have looked for insects and other possible \"normal\"explanations for such behavior, without success. My family never had a pet by the time I wasexperiencing OBEs, but JP had a cat named Zack. During one OBE, I encountered Zack in JP'sapartment. It was my only encounter with an animal, during an out-of-body experience:10/21/83 Fri - OBE #98This happened on 10/18/83: I've only had a chance to write it down now. I was havingstrange dreams, and I became semiconscious. Then I noticed I was weightless and thatrealization brought me to a fuller consciousness: I woke up. I was in JP's living room and Isaw JP's cat Zack, and he seemed to see me. I decided as long as I was a spirit, and I wasnear Zack, I should try to frighten him to prove to myself that he saw me. So I stood up tall,raised my arms, and started to run, reaching toward Zack. That cat ran very quickly away!EXERCISE 21A Ship's BowThis is similar to the theater chair method. Relax completely. As vividly as you can, imagine you arestanding on the bow (front) of a ship in the middle of the ocean. Imagine the water is completely calmand you are looking out over the water. You are completely at peace. Slowly, waves start to kick up andthe boat starts to rock up and down. As the boat rocks up, feel yourself lift up. As the boat rocks down,feel yourself gently set down again. Gradually, make each wave bigger until the waves are ten feet high.With each wave, you rise and fall rhythmically. As you fall with each new wave, try to \"feel\" that sinkingfeeling in the pit of your stomach, as if you are really there.Again, this can call the vibrations and pull you away from your body.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap21.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap21.html (3 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:25 AM]"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22Out-of-Body RealityMany books about out-of-body experiences say that during an OBE, our thoughts produce instant reality.Well, maybe not instantly. Sometimes it seems as if our subconscious thoughts are more powerful thanour conscious thoughts. Our beliefs, expectations and fears also play a large part in what we experiencewhile out of our bodies.For instance, why do you even have an astral body? While you are out of your body, why should youneed a body at all? Why do you need astral hands? If you try to pick something up, your hands will passright through the object. Why do you need astral eyes? With mind-sensing, you can sense everythingaround you without even using your eyes. Why do you need astral legs if you can just as easily float orfly wherever you want? The answer is, you don't need an astral body! We have astral bodies because weare so accustomed to operating with a body. It's part of our self-image. We believe in our bodies sostrongly that we create astral bodies for ourselves to use during an OBE. Perhaps we also do it as aconvenience to others. How would we recognize a friend if he or she didn't have an astral body with theirfamiliar face?Let's take this one step further. During an OBE, are we naked or do we wear clothes? The answer is,sometimes we are naked, but most of the time we do wear astral clothes. The few people who reportbeing naked during an OBE usually \"feel naked\" without their body.Others report that they were wearing white robes, unlike any clothes they own in physical life. Thesepeople usually believe that they are dead or they are temporarily spirits, and what else do spirits wear?There are also many people who find themselves in astral clothes identical to the clothes they werewearing at the time of the OBE. Often these people don't realize at first that they are out of their bodies.One moment they lie down for a nap, and the next moment they find themselves standing up and feelinglight on their feet. And of course, they believe they are wearing the same clothes.More common, however, is the case where the subject doesn't remember whether he or she was wearingclothes. They just don't seem to notice. That is usually the case during my OBEs. I don't even think aboutthe clothes I am wearing, and since I'm not thinking about it, no clothes are created. And I don't evennotice the clothes are missing.The point is, while we are out of the body our beliefs do influence our experience. Our thoughts alsoinfluence our experience, but they are subject to our beliefs.Not only does this law work for astral objects like clothes, but our astral bodies as well. If we believe ourastral bodies are malleable, they will be. Some people have reported their astral bodies were not in theshape of a human body, but in another shape. Take the following OBE for example:11/08/81 Sun - OBE #55...I separated my head last, and then I felt just like a balloon. I was bouncing up and downbut stuck to my body in a way I could not tell. I couldn't turn around. My consciousness waschap22.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap22.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:42 AM]"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"again very clear and concise....If I had an astral body, then it was curled up into a ball-shape.And I was stuck to my body's right side; that is, by the right arm.After experiencing a few OBEs and reading several books, I came to believe the astral body was notsolid. As a result, I started having experiences like the following:02/23/80 - OBE #9...Another strange thing about this morning's projection is: I folded my arms around mychest to rest them, but they went right through my chest! They rested on the bed.This example shows the malleability of the astral body: I folded my arms through my chest instead of ontop.Some people can travel just by thinking of a person or place. But it's not always that simple. It's not justthe thought that makes us travel, but our beliefs too. In Journeys Out of the Body, Robert Monroe wasn'talways able to travel to a desired person or place. When trying to contact a friend, he often found himselfin unexpected, unfamiliar surroundings.I've also run into these problems. I think the problems stemmed mainly from my beliefs. I couldn'trationalize how people could move from place to place during OBEs, and my doubts and skepticism gotin my way. I harbored a belief that it takes more than thoughts to travel. Limiting beliefs such as thesecan cause us a great deal of trouble. Here is an example:12/22/85 Sun - OBE #120...Annoyed, I closed my eyes again, sat up again, turned and stood up again. This time Iwalked blindly through the door into the living room. I walked across the living room,almost to the door to the apartment. I thought, \"I'm far enough away from my body now; Itshould be safe to open my eyes.\" I opened my eyes, and again I was transported back to thesame position just above the body.I figured this was happening because of some belief I harbored, so I decided to combat thebelief. As I lay there, I thought strongly, \"I am the master of my reality, and I control whathappens here.\" With that thought, I felt a strong sensation like a vibration that swept intome, giving me a sense of power.I thought, \"Good. Now, I will raise myself up with the power of my thoughts.\" I used mymind to pull up, and I started forcefully rising up one half foot...one foot... one and one-halffeet. Then I questioned whether it ought to work, since I hadn't had much luck in the pastwith this method. That doubt caused me to stop rising, and I started gently bobbing up anddown, as if my conflicting beliefs were fighting each other, one pulling me up, the otherpushing me down. Then I blacked out.The following experience illustrates further how we can use one set of beliefs to combat another set ofbeliefs:04/13/86 Sun - OBE #125This morning I was trying to sleep but kept thinking about trying to leave my body. As I waschap22.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap22.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:42 AM]"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"heading toward sleep I found myself in a very good condition for OBEs. I was laying on myleft side. Very easily I started myself swaying back and forth in my body, as describedbefore. I swayed back and forth and slipped outside my body. I thought, \"Well, that waseasy enough.\" I slipped a little bit backward and found myself stuck to the body. I tried topry myself away, but was unsuccessful. I closed my eyes and said aloud, \"I am in completecontrol of this reality while I am out of my body. If I am stuck, it's because I believe I amstuck. And I no longer want to be stuck.\" I opened my eyes again and tried once more to prymyself away, also without success.I decided to try something different. My body was near the edge of the bed. I reasoned thatif I were close to the edge of the bed and pushed myself off, I would fall off the bed, thusfreeing myself from the body. I was using my own beliefs to free myself: I knew I had abelief that I would fall off the bed. This belief was stronger than my belief that I was stuckto my body. I rolled a little bit until I was laying on my back (my body was still on its leftside). I wanted to fall gently, so I gently fell to the ground and I felt a sharp--but notpainful--jab in my back caused by hitting something on the floor next to my bed.The point is, if you are planning to attempt OBEs, it's very helpful, before you set out on your adventure,to examine your desires, beliefs, fears and expectations about the experience.EXERCISE 22BuzzingThis exercise is similar to the musical imagination exercise. Relax completely, then try to get to thatpassive, quiesced frame of mind.As vividly as you can, imagine there is a course buzzing sound in your head. Pretend the buzzing is just alittle bit too quiet to hear, but getting louder. Simultaneously listen intently for the buzzing to becomeloud enough to hear.As the buzzing becomes louder, imagine the sound is causing your soul to vibrate. Increase the imaginarysound until you feel like your soul is being rattled and shaken to the core. Hold the imaginary buzzingand vibrating for several minutes.Repeat the procedure several times if necessary.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap22.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap22.html (3 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:42 AM]"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23Environmental FactorsFor a long time I tried to find out if out-of-body experiences are influenced by environmental factors,such as weather, moon cycles, biorhythms, etc. I usually kept good records of my OBEs so that I couldstudy these variables. Here is what I found:WeatherWeather doesn't seem to influence my ability to have OBEs. I've lived in Arizona as well as Minnesota,and I've induced OBEs when outside temperatures were near -30F and also when outside temperatureswere near +115F. However, if my body is too hot or cold, it's hard for me to achieve the focus needed toinduce an OBE. It doesn't seem to matter if it's raining, snowing or sunny.Moon CyclesSome people believe that the moon can affect our ability to induce OBEs, but I think that's a myth. Istudied the moon cycles a long time and found no influence. I've had OBEs under full moons, newmoons, and everything between. For one period of study that spanned over a year and a half, I averaged a58% full moon.BiorhythmsFor a long time I kept track of my biorhythms, in the hopes that I would find a correlation. Biorhythmsdidn't seem to make a difference. I've had OBEs on Physical, Emotional, and Intellectual \"critical\" days.I've also had OBEs when these influences were farthest from their \"critical\" period.Months of the YearI've had OBEs in all months of the year. Strangely, I usually have fewer OBEs in July. I suspect that'sbecause July is when I have the least amount of time to practice.Days of the WeekI've had OBEs on every day of the week, but I've had many more OBEs on Saturdays and Sundays. Thatis because I have the time to practice then. On the weekend, I can stay in bed late and induce OBEs oncemy body is fully rested and relaxed. During the week, I don't normally have the time required to induceOBEs.chap23.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap23.html (1 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:57 AM]"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Special DaysHalloween is traditionally considered a special day, the day that spirits can influence and communicatewith the physical world. Other days such as Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving have special meaningsfor various groups of people. These special days can evoke feelings in believers; fear on Halloween,peace on Christmas, worship on Easter. Do the collective feelings of these people affect our ability toleave the body? As far as I can tell, no. What about the emotions we have on these days? To somedegree, I believe our emotions do have an effect. Once, I was uncomfortable about leaving my body onHalloween because I thought it would be a perfect opportunity for spirits to possess my body. But I did itanyway, and there were no complications.Prior Amount of SleepI've had OBEs with various amounts of sleep. I recommend getting lots of sleep before you try to haveOBEs. One of the biggest problems is trying to induce OBEs when the body is too tired.Prior Music Listening HabitsMusic relaxes my consciousness too quickly to induce an OBE. During practice, I like to hold on to theedge of consciousness as long as I can. If I listen to music, I get distracted by it and drop off quickly tosleep. Therefore, I recommend silence.FoodAs far as I can tell, food has absolutely no influence on my ability to have OBEs. However, people havereported that fasting can increase the ability to have OBEs. I've never tried fasting. Some people believethat vegetarianism is better for OBEs. I've tried a vegetarian diet (except for eating dairy products) and itdidn't seem to make a difference.LiquidsI haven't found any correlation between my intake of liquids and my ability to have OBEs. I dorecommend avoiding alcoholic beverages before trying to induce OBEs. Alcohol unfocuses your mind.Believe me: You need as much focus as possible. Sylvan Muldoon recommended jarring yoursubconscious into taking you out of body by making yourself as thirsty as possible. Muldoon claimedthat if you went to bed very thirsty, your subconscious will sometimes \"sleepwalk\" astrally toward asource of water. In other words, your subconscious detects the thirst, and tries to satisfy it subconsciouslybecause you refuse to do it consciously. I've never tried this method.ReadingReading OBE books does influence my ability to have OBEs. When I read a book about OBEs, I focusmy full attention on the topic while I'm reading, and that sends a message to my subconscious: Let meout! And it does.chap23.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap23.html (2 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:57 AM]"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"DirectionIn Journeys Out of the Body, Robert Monroe recommended pointing your body North when trying toinduce OBEs. I've tried to have OBEs facing all directions, and I've been successful in all directions.Strangely enough, I have my best luck when my body is pointing West. I have my worst luck when mybody is pointing North. When I induced the vibrations the first time, my body was pointing West.Perhaps it's more effective to point the direction you did during your first successful experience.PracticeBy far, the biggest influence on my ability to have OBEs has been the amount of time I spend practicingit.EXERCISE 23A High-Pitched WhiningDuring your OBE practice sessions, you may have noticed a high-pitched whining noise in your head. Ifyou listen closely, you will notice the noise I'm referring to. We all hear this high- pitched soundconstantly, but normally the sound is drowned out by constant distractions and sounds all around us.Most people don't notice it, but some people have a disorder called tinnitis, which causes this sound to beunusually loud and distracting. You can use this sound to induce OBEs.For this exercise, relax and focus your mind as before. Then start listening for this whining sound in yourhead. Once you find it, use your imagination to try to increase the pitch and volume. Increase the pitchuntil the sound is almost out of the range of your hearing. This can cause the vibrations to sweep in andfree you from your body.Personally, I think the sound has nothing to do with the vibrations. This exercise is effective onlybecause it can teach you how to properly focus your mind.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap23.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap23.html (3 of 3) [5/4/1999 9:26:57 AM]"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24How to Have an Out-of-Body ExperienceMany people try to induce OBEs without success because they don't know what to do. Unfortunately,most books on the subject don't contain instructions. The few books that contain instructions are typicallyvague and incomplete. In the exercises given with each chapter, I have already suggested many things totry. In this chapter, I want to fill in some of the gaps, and also provide a detailed description of my mostsuccessful method. Of course, I can't guarantee positive results. Your success depends on the amount ofeffort you put forth.ConditioningMost OBE authors agree that your subconscious takes you out of your body every night. With practiceyou can use this to your advantage: You can train your subconscious to \"wake you up\" after it has left thebody. I have used many methods for impressing this idea on my subconscious: affirmations, readingbooks, listening to subliminal OBE suggestion tapes, playful visualizations and listening to music thathas OBE-suggestive words.The first method, affirmations or self-suggestion, is to tell yourself, \"I want to have an out-of-bodyexperience,\" \"I want to leave my body\" or similar suggestions. The best times to do this are right beforeyou fall asleep and especially right after you wake up in the morning. At these times you are in closecontact with your subconscious. I wake up very slowly. For about a half hour I'm in contact with mysubconscious mind. When I give myself suggestions then, they are very effective. Make theseaffirmations several times a day.The second method is to read OBE books. I usually have more OBEs when I've recently been reading abook on astral projection. Reading about OBEs and thinking about them as you read makes animpression on your subconscious mind that can often be more effective than self-suggestion.The third method is to use suggestion tapes. The Monroe Institute now has sets of \"Gateway\" tapes to aidthe would-be astral traveler. Valley of the Sun Publishing has a set called \"Astral Projection\" whichcontains one hypnosis tape and one subliminal suggestion tape. Other tapes are also available.The fourth method is to use playful imagination. Affirmations that use visualization are even better thanverbal affirmations. Visualize yourself separating from the body. As you do, think to yourself, \"Yes, Ican do that.\" Imagine elaborate scenes where you are either flying through valleys like a glider, orshooting away from your body into outer-space. Again, this should be done frequently throughout theday, and especially right after you wake up in the morning.The fifth method is to listen to music with words that suggest OBEs. I made a tape for myself, full ofsuch songs by various artists. The songs might not be about OBEs, but they still remind me of themenough to make an impression on my subconscious mind. Some examples are: \"Kashmir\" by Ledchap24.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap24.html (1 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:27:45 AM]"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Zeppelin, \"Astral Traveler\" by Yes, \"The Wall\" by Kansas, \"Lights\" by Styx, \"Fly By Night\" by Rushand \"Backwards Traveler\" by Paul McCartney.Physical PreparationThe best time to attempt an OBE is in the morning, after you have woken up naturally (i.e., not from analarm clock.) Since most of us work during the week, it's easier to try on the weekends. Give your bodyplenty of rest. Each person needs a different amount of sleep. The trick is to make your body tiredenough to stay in a relaxed state, but not too tired. If I don't sleep enough, I'm too tired and fall back intoa deep sleep while practicing. If I oversleep and then practice, I am too wide awake and can't focus well.The body should be well rested but relaxed, and the mind must be alert.When the time comes to practice, try to detect how tired you are. If you're too tired, stretch a little in bedor shake the sleep off. Some people may want to get up first and have a cup of coffee first. This willusually keep you from falling back to sleep during practice. It is better to wake yourself up completelybefore starting.Music is wonderful for relaxation and calming the mind. It's okay to listen to relaxing music during yourOBE practice, but this can also work against you: Listening to external sounds can distract you fromfocusing inward. Also, if you listen to music before bedtime, you may be too relaxed and sleepy topractice the next morning.When you practice, make sure you have good circulation. Get into a position where your limbs won't\"fall asleep\" because of poor circulation.Make sure you won't be distracted during practice. Keep your windows closed to keep noises out, unplugthe telephone, turn off all televisions, radios and other noisy things. Don't set any time limits on yourpractice. It is counter-productive to check the time and wonder if your time limit is up. Also, make sureyour bladder is empty before practice; The need to go to the bathroom can ruin a good practice.STEP 1. RelaxationThe next important condition for OBE induction is a completely relaxed physical body. Relaxation isimportant because if you aren't relaxed, you'll have too much consciousness focused in your body.Laboratory tests on astral travelers have shown (with the help of BSR and GSR skin resistance monitors)that the physical body is more relaxed during an OBE than during sleep. Ideally, your physical bodyshould be completely relaxed in every respect during practice. I recommend practicing relaxation everyday until you can completely relax your physical body in a few minutes.Relax your body from limb to limb, working from your feet up to your head, until even your face iscompletely relaxed. Use any technique you are comfortable with to relax completely. If you don't knowany relaxation techniques, do this: Systematically tighten each muscle and make it tense until there is achap24.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap24.html (2 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:27:45 AM]"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"slight fatigue, then let go and feel the muscle relax. After you've relaxed every muscle, start over andcheck every muscle again.You may notice that the more relaxed your body is, the less you can actually \"feel\" it. Encourage thisfeeling: While you're relaxing, pretend as vividly as you can that you do not have your left arm; as if it'sbeen cut off and you can't feel it. When the sensation of having no arm becomes quite real to you, thatarm is very relaxed. Next, pretend that your other arm does not exist. Next, your legs. Have some playfulfun by pretending that your arms are in different positions, and see how vividly you can imagine thesethings. If you are able to lose all feeling in your arms and legs, or imaginarily feel they are in differentpositions, your body is very relaxed.Next, relax your face completely. Here's one way to relax your face: With your eyes closed, stare deeperand deeper into the blackness, while very slowly tightening your eyebrows and rolling your eyes upslightly until your eyebrow muscles become tired. Then completely relax your facial muscles for about15 seconds. Repeat the process again until your eyebrow muscles are tired again, and relax again foranother 15 seconds. Repeat this process about six or seven times. Completely relax your whole bodyagain and then try to make your mind blank and relaxed too. The vibrations may even come at this point,making the rest of the process unnecessary! After you're completely relaxed, pay no more attention toyour body.STEP 2. Quiesce and Focus Your MindThis is the Single Most Important step. There are five key points to focusing your mind for OBEinduction. They are: state of mind, realism, motion, receptivity and passivity.When you are trying to leave your body the most important thing is your state of mind. When I've beenin an \"ideal\" state of mind, leaving my body seems like child's play, as easy and natural as breathing. Butwhen I'm not in that state of mind it seems very difficult. I can't \"teach\" this state of mind but I candescribe what it's like. Once you've experienced astral projection you'll know what state of mind to aimfor. The best state of mind is one in which you are a quiet, completely passive, single-minded observer.In this passive state, your mind does not wander. You are not emotional. You are not analytical either.You are merely an observer. Visualization is important in many OBE techniques and this passive state ofmind makes it easier to visualize images a long time without your mind \"wandering.\"The second point, realism, has to do with the degree of focus. This world seems real to us because we areso focused here. You should learn to focus outside your body to such a degree that it all becomes real.Focus your mind into that single thread of consciousness.The third point, motion, concerns the swaying motion you feel within your body. I start an inner\"swaying\" sensation in my imagination that later becomes quite real. Then I use the momentum of theswaying to propel myself out of my body. Pretend that your body is gently swaying back and forth, orleft to right in a regular motion. Try to make this swaying feeling as vivid as possible.The fourth point is receptivity. This receptive state of mind is important in calling or inducing thechap24.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap24.html (3 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:27:45 AM]"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"vibrations. You should learn to make yourself receptive to whatever comes during practice.The fifth point, passivity, is also very important. The more passive you are, the easier it is to enter theOBE state. As long as you have a conscious \"controlling interest\" in your experience, you are too focusedin this reality. Develop the attitude of doing the exercises, not because you are interested in watchingthem, but just for passive reasons: Just to see what happens next, or just for the sake of doing it. Whilepracticing, you should only be concerned with the current moment in time. Be accepting of what comes.Try to assume an attitude where you really don't care what will happen. Be completely in the presentmoment, with no thoughts of what will happen next. The American Heritage Dictionary defines\"passive\" as:1. Receiving or subjected to an action without responding or initiating an action in return. 2. Acceptingwithout objection or resistance; compliant. 3. Not participating, acting, or operating; inert....By this definition, you should be in a state where you can be subjected to weird feelings withoutresponding, physically or mentally. No matter what hits you, you should be in such a passive state that,when something hits you, you think, \"Oh. That's nice,\" and just continue to lie there and visualize.In this passive state, you can initiate actions (like the visualizations) without responding to them. You fallasleep by becoming interested in, and responding to your own thoughts and visualizations. If you caninitiate that state and keep your consciousness out of that dream-trap, you can retain your consciousnessafter it leaves your body. You just want to become a passive observer.I've talked before about needing to suspend a certain portion of your consciousness to leave your body.Suspend the portion that has a vested interest in what's happening.Slow your thoughts and bring yourself into that passive and receptive state of mind. Clear your mind ofall thoughts: There are many techniques for doing this. If you don't have a method, try the following:With your eyes closed, pretend that you're looking for something that might appear directly in front ofyou. Just quietly watch your mental viewing screen. Stare into the blackness.STEP 3. Wander the Edge of ConsciousnessThe next step is to \"wander the edge of consciousness,\" exploring the border between waking andsleeping. Allow yourself to start falling asleep, but then \"catch\" yourself and rouse yourself again andmake sure you're fully conscious. Let yourself start to fall asleep again, this time allowing yourself to geta little closer toward sleep, then rouse yourself again. Do this several times until your body is veryrelaxed and your mind is in that \"passive\" framework that I discussed.chap24.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap24.html (4 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:27:45 AM]"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Step 4.

Sway the Object a Small AmountThen begin to move the object back and forth so that it appears to come a little bit closer to you and thenmoves back to where it began. At first, visualize only a tiny amount of movement, as if the object ismerely slowly swaying toward you and away from you.Keep the object swaying constantly. Don't let it stop moving. Keeping the object in motion will help tostabilize the image in your mind and give it more realism.chap24.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap24.html (5 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:27:45 AM]"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Step 6.

Each time the object pulls away, it should look smaller. Remember, you must also keep thatpassive, quiesced state of mind during the entire exercise.Step 7. Sway Opposite To The ObjectTry to feel as if you are swaying in the opposite direction as the object. Imagine the object has a stronggravity which affects your swaying. As the object swings closer to you, you are pulled toward it. As itswings away from you, you sway back to your original position within your body.As the object gets closer and closer with each swing, feel its gravity pull you more and more in itsdirection.chap24.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap24.html (6 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:27:45 AM]"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" Step 8.

And I wastrying to deny it all. I didn't consider myself psychic, but psychic experiences kept piling up, one uponanother, forcing me to admit that I had psychic abilities. What's more, psychic things happened so oftenthat I couldn't write it off as coincidence. I felt as if my \"higher self\" was combating my skepticism bythrowing undeniable, unbelievable things in my face.I had many different types of psychic experiences. Remarkable, it all seemed to happen over night. Ascrazy as it sounded, wishes started coming true. Suddenly the world was magical.Telepathy:Suddenly I was \"taking the words out of people's mouths,\" not weekly or daily, but hourly! I wrote someof these down in my journals. Here are some examples:05/12/80 Mon...I asked my mom what we had for lunch. The word \"tuna fish\" came to me. A while latershe said, \"There might be some tuna fish around.\"05/20/80Today JF and I were talking about how neat it would be if BS (our English teacher) was alsoour computer-science teacher. I THOUGHT, \"What was BS's major in college?\". JFsuddenly SAID, \"He was a physics major.\"10/14/83 Fri...For one of my classes this quarter, I am in a team of five people working on a computerproject. Today we had to think of a name for our team. I suggested the name \"MagnumOpus,\" and right away one of my teammates said he had just been thinking that, and wasabout to suggest it himself!10/04/85 Fri...I was programming busily, when I thought I heard JP ask about my computer program (if Ifixed my ENDIF statements in a particular section of code). I started explaining to him that Idid, and what else I had done, when he told me that he never asked the question! He onlyTHOUGHT about asking me! And yet I answered him as if he asked the question he had inhis mind.chap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (1 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Telepathic SendingThis is similar to telepathy, except you are deliberately trying to send a message to another person.Another term might be \"Remote Suggestion.\" This is the ability to put thoughts or suggestions into theminds of others. A good example was the incident in which I suggested that my bus driver speed up.Here are more examples:08/20/80 WedI went to Burger King for lunch. With my lunch I ordered some french fries. When theserver went to get my fries, I telepathed, \"Give me a few more.\" Right before my eyes, sheturned around, reached in the bin and added more fries to my order!

I said aloud, \"I don't believe it!\"03/19/81 Thu...I was eating supper with my Dad and I wanted a napkin. I decided to do a psychicexperiment. I tried to put the word \"Napkin\" into my Dad's mind. A little while later, hereached up and grabbed a napkin for me. That's not too strange. But then he asked, \"Wereyou just thinking 'Napkin'?\" Then I told him about my experiment.10/21/85 Mon...PF is a local computer dealer. During the previous week, he had ordered some computersfrom our company. He never went through with his order, and all of us wanted DB to callPF and ask him about his order. DB didn't want to call PF back. At a particular time in theday, I said to everyone, \"Since DB doesn't want to call PF, we'll have to get PF to call us!\"JS asked, \"How are we going to do that?\" I replied, \"Well, we'll think about him really hard,and then he'll pick up on it and call us.\" Amused, JS said, \"Okay.\" A few minutes later, PFcalled, after about a week of not hearing from him. JS said, \"It worked!\"ClairvoyanceClairvoyance is when we perceive something out of the range of our senses. For instance, it was commonfor me to \"know\" what song was playing on the radio before I turned it on, or to \"hear\" the next song tobe played, before the current song was over. It was common for me to brush these experiences off as\"coincidence\" to a certain point, but when these coincidences started stacking up, I started writing themdown in my journals. I couldn't ignore them any longer.This ability was very helpful. Often I knew when the telephone would ring. Sometimes I would alsoknow who was calling, which helped me avoid people I didn't want to talk to. In playing cards, I would\"know\" which card was best for me to play, without knowing or needing to know what the other playershad. Sometimes I had fun with this ability. Here is an example:05/31/84 Thu...I was talking with my friend and fellow programmer, WB, about names. He said, \"I betyou could never guess my middle name it's so strange.\" I calmly said, \"Otto,\" and he saidchap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (2 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"\"Wow! How did you know? I never told that to anyone, and it isn't on my job application orW-4 forms either!\" Then he said, \"But I got another middle name, but you'd never guess thisother one in a million years.\" I calmly said, \"Garhard?\" to which he replied, \"How did youknow that? That's not a common name!\" I just said \"Just a guess,\" to which he replied, \"Idon't believe it!\"VisionsAlthough this is similar to clairvoyance, I list it separately because there is a difference: Withclairvoyance, I just seemed to \"know\" things out of the reach of my senses, but with visions I sawclear-as-day pictures in front of me. I had to draw my own conclusions from those visions. Here's anexample:05/06/80 TueA couple of weeks ago, I was going to sleep one night and ...suddenly I saw a vision. In thevision I saw a very clear picture of my Aunt K. laying down with her eyes closed. I knewshe wasn't dead, but asleep or passed-out in the vision. When it was over I got out of bed,and walked to the living room where my mom was reading. I asked her, \"How is Aunt K?\"She said, \"Why?\" I told her of my vision and she said that she hadn't talked to Aunt K. for along time.Last Friday I heard the story. Aunt K. was in bed one night when she fell out of bed. Whenshe fell, she hit her head, and for a while she was blinded. Now she is out of the hospitalafter days, and she is recovering her sight.As close as I can tell, the vision took place on or near the day of her accident.Psychic DreamsI discovered that dreams can be a source of psychic information. On 08/02/81, I had a dream that startednormally: I was at the University bookstore. Then the dream took on a strange quality, and I was pagedto come to the information desk. At the information desk, a lady handed me a telephone. A woman'svoice told me I should come home because there had been a death in my family. I asked the woman whohad died, but she said she couldn't tell me; all she could tell me was the person's social security numberover the phone. When she told me the social security number, I \"knew\" it was my father who had \"died\"in my dream. I was shocked and sad, so I consciously decided to end the dream (which led me to anOBE). My father was in perfect health, but not for long. This was the first \"warning\" I was given aboutmy father's death.PrecognitionPrecognition could also be classified as clairvoyance, but instead of the ability to \"know\" the present, thisis the ability to \"know\" the future. On November 2, 1981, I had a certain \"feeling\" or \"knowing\" that myfather was soon to die. I wrote it down, but I didn't tell anyone my feeling. My father was still in goodhealth. Soon after that, my dad became ill and died on January 13, 1982. A better example ofprecognition is the following:chap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (3 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"11/26/80 WedI took a 94B bus home from work today. On the bus ride to downtown Minneapolis, Ithought about many things, but the main thought that kept nagging me the whole way homewas: \"I'd better relax more, in case we get in an accident.\" I would feel the need forrelaxation, then I would realize I was tense, then I would relax again. When I'd tense upagain, I'd tell myself to relax again, and so on. The thoughts kept nagging me until I decidedto pursue them. I thought about the prospect of my bus getting in an accident. I keptreassuring myself, \"No way could it happen.\" But the thought nagged. I looked around meto see how cushioned I'd be if I were to get in an accident. I was sitting sideways, next toanother man who would cushion me in an accident. I looked to see how everyone else wascushioned. There was only one person better-cushioned than I. I thought about having anaccident for about five to ten minutes. Then I relaxed a final time, and I stayed relaxed forthe rest of the bus ride. Sure enough, my bus then hit a van from behind.Deja VuDeja Vu is similar to precognition; you have a certain sense of knowing what the future will be, but thereis also an overwhelming sense of having done it all before. It is as if the whole scene was rehearsedcountless times in the past. It is typical to ask yourself, \"Haven't I done this before?\" These experiencestie into psychic dreams. Here is an example from my journals:07/05/84 ThuI've had two deja vu experiences recently. The first I'll mention was today. I was at APS, atCC's terminal. CC was on the phone, and I knew every word she said, before she said it. Ibroke out laughing, but she didn't understand why I was laughing.The other experience was last Tuesday. I was at APS, talking to SB about [the] BASIC[computer language] when I remembered I had done this once before in a dream, and I kneweverything SB was going to say. In the dream, my boss DJ walked in and saw me talkingwith SB about BASIC. I was embarrassed because I don't normally use BASIC in my work.I thought, \"Oh no! DJ will be coming in here any instant and I'll have to explain myself. I'vegot to get out of here fast!\" So I tried to excuse myself and leave. But when I tried to leave,SB asked me some question, which delayed me further. I answered and tried to leave again.He stopped me again saying \"Hang on, let me show you something.\" I tried to escape a thirdtime and fourth time, but each time SB came up with a reason to keep me there. Then DJcame in the room and said the same thing he said in my dream. I was indeed embarrassed,and I had to explain my interest in BASIC, and how it pertains to my current work.The example mentioned above lasted a long time--about twenty minutes. Both experiences were\"remembered\" from a dream. At times I would dream the future quite often, and the dreams would giveme a deja vu experience later. My personal belief is that we use our dreams sometimes to plan the future.The dreams were the plans, and the plans were carried out perfectly. In these cases my efforts to changethe planned events were continually thwarted.chap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (4 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"ApparitionsThe main problem I had with most psychic experiences is that they were not very concrete. Often theywere just \"feelings\" I had about situations, or a \"stray\" thoughts in my mind. I had a hard time believingin these phenomena. I found out there were other, more concrete types of psychic phenomena, such asapparitions. An apparition is the physical appearance of a nonphysical entity or object. The following isan example:08/19/83 FriWednesday I had read an article in The Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, onthe subject of mediumship. The articles talked about physical manifestations of all sorts, andI was interested in it. I wished right then that some spirits would do a physical manifestationfor me, to prove it to me.Later that night I woke up startled, with a sense of danger. I opened my eyes and much tomy shock I saw a hand materialized in midair near my head, and the hand held something. Iwas so shocked and frightened that I jumped and shook the bed violently. Whatever was inthe hand went flying, and the hand withdrew from me and went up and disintegrated. Ifainted and my consciousness gradually fell into nothingness, although there was a slightdelay.Psychokinesis (PK) or Telekinesis (TK)Psychokinesis is when something is physically moved or altered by psychic means. One day I had justleft my place of work at about 8:00pm. I was very excited about many things: The book I was readingwas exciting, I recently had an exciting OBE and other exciting things were happening. For some reason,as I waited to catch my bus, I felt very psychically strong. I felt as if I could do anything. I'm never idlewith such feelings; I had to find some way to test out this feeling of power. I looked around for nearbyobjects. \"If I really have this power,\" I reasoned to myself, \"I can probably walk over to any parkingmeter and open it up with my mind.\" I walked over to a random parking meter, slipped my hands gentlyaround it, and it opened effortlessly! Shiny coins spilled all over the ground. For a second or two I stoodthere in shock. What if someone saw me? What should I do? I am a very honest person. I tried to closethe meter, but spilled coins were keeping the door from closing. I quickly cleared it out, closed the door,and started frantically plugging coins into the meter. Occasional drivers must have thought I was crazyplugging handfuls of coins into a parking meter, long after parking hours. Especially since there wasn't acar in that spot! I picked up all the coins from the ground and plugged them one by one into the meter.My heart was still pounding as I got on the bus, and a long time after that.Here is another example from my journals:09/24/84 MonWeird things are starting to happen again. After work I wanted to do some drawing, but Ihaven't seen my drawing pencil since our trip. I tried unsuccessfully to find the pencil manytimes since. The last time I looked was Saturday when I searched the house and JP'sapartment.chap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (5 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Today I searched again for it, but without success and while I was searching, my inner voicesaid, \"try using your psi to find it.\" I didn't find it, so JP and I decided to go shopping forone. Before we left I sat in the middle of his living room next to the biggest chair, waitingfor him to get ready.We went shopping but I didn't buy a new pencil since JP offered to lend me one. When wegot home, I went up to JP's apartment. While he got on the phone, I wandered into themiddle of his living room. There, in the middle of JP's biggest chair was my drawing pencil!I asked JP about it, but he said it was impossible because he had been sitting on that chairjust before we left! Therefore, before we left there was no pencil on the chair, or in factanywhere to be found. But when we returned, the pencil was lying on the chair. There isabsolutely no possible explanation of how that pencil appeared there, where it came from, oranything. It had to have been teleported there because JP was never out of my sight from thetime we left until the time we returned. That chair was empty when we left.ClairaudienceClairaudience is the ability to hear voices of people who are not physically present. Experience wouldsuggest this can happen between two living persons as well as the traditional \"spirit voices.\" This isdifferent from telepathy. In telepathy you \"pick up\" the thoughts of others. In clairaudience, you hear avoice as plain as day. When it's happened to me, it's been so loud and clear that I've looked around to seewho was speaking, but no one was in sight. Here are two good examples:10/14/83 FriOne other remarkable thing happened a couple of weeks ago. I was at the Universitycampus, walking to one of my classes, and I was thinking about an article in TheEncyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology that said the term \"inner voice\" refers toclairaudience. Suddenly I spiritually heard a female voice. The voice said \"My name isJulia, and I say it's not important where the wisdom comes from, but rather, it's the wisdomitself that counts!\" That was the first time I ever heard a voice that claimed to have a name!Also, that voice didn't need translation like my inner voice does. Instead, the words camethrough directly. Naturally, it shocked me quite a lot.07/05/84 ThuToday I was working at a customer site for work. I had arranged for SO to meet me at PCompany at 6:00pm. At 5:40pm I looked at my watch and thought, \"I have plenty of time;SO won't be here for twenty minutes.\" So I started entering data into their computer. At5:45pm I heard SO's voice--loud and clear--yelling something like, \"Hello? Anyone there?\"I couldn't believe SO would be there so early, yet I heard his voice. It sounded as if he wereyelling from outside yet I was sitting in the Parts Room in the middle of a big building. Allthe windows were closed and locked about 100 feet away.I ran to the big doors, opened them, and ran outside, only to find SO just getting off hismotorcycle, taking off his (full) helmet. I asked him if he yelled anything and he said hedidn't; he just arrived. He said he tried to mentally send the message to me! I checked; therewas no way he could have yelled loud enough for me to hear him in the Parts Roomchap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (6 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"(especially with his motorcycle helmet on!)

SO remarked,\"either you're very sensitive or I'm a very strong transmitter.\"Other ExperiencesSome experiences just don't quite fit into any categories. Here are a few examples:09/27/80 SatA large moth came into my bedroom. I mentally commanded it to enter my cupped hands. Itimmediately fluttered directly into my hands, and I cupped my hands around it. Then Ipromptly ushered it out of the house without harming it.04/17/81 FriFor some reason or another I was trying to think of the German word for \"tired.\" I wrackedmy brains. I was still trying to remember it when I heard myself physically say, \"Mude!\"Then I thought, \"Yeah, that's it.\" Then I realized what happened. I remembered the wordonly because my body just said it. I had no intention of saying anything, nor did I rememberthe word until after I said it. Weird!Conclusions:Of course, there are also many psychic things I haven't experienced. I've never experienced mediumship,automatic writing, or anything like that.When most of these experiences were happening to me, I wasn't really expecting them or even wantingthem. I wanted OBEs because they were concrete and indisputable in my own mind. They couldn't bebrushed off as coincidences or delusions of grandeur. It was undeniably real to me as a participant. Still,when I practiced my OBE techniques, I was exploring altered states of consciousness and meditation.And that was enough to unlock all these other \"psychic\" experiences, and more.Therefore, I warn you: if you do plan to try out-of-body experiences for yourself, be prepared for apossible barrage of other psychic experiences. On the other hand, if your aim is to develop psychicabilities, practicing OBE techniques may work well. You may get a few OBEs out of the deal too!The possibilities of psychic experience are as wide and varied as normal experience. But a person'spsychic abilities don't make them more spiritual or better than anyone else. Rather than to aim forinducing out-of-body experiences or psychic experiences, I would prefer that you strive for spiritualgrowth (whatever that means to you.) I believe that working on your own spiritual growth will naturallymake you more psychic as you progress.chap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (7 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"EXERCISE 25Developing Psychic SkillsAs I learned more about psychic experiences, I discovered that my psychic abilities fade in and fade outin cycles. At times they are strong, and at other times they seemed to fade out completely. I also learnedthat it's possible to increase psychic abilities. Here are some exercises that may increase your psychicabilities:Practice meditation and OBEs.l Give yourself suggestions just before sleep and when you first wake up. For example: \"I want tobe psychic.\"l Visualize yourself pouring love out in all directions.l Imagine extending your awareness until you're trying to feel the emotions of your wholeneighborhood.l Try musical meditation and listening to hypnotic songs.l Give yourself reminders (\"post-it\" notes or whatever) with messages like \"You are psychic\" or\"You can leave your body.\"l Make pacts with your Higher Self. Here is an example:l I want to be psychic. I know that the Universe will respond to my needs and desires quicklyand completely. In return, I promise to cooperate with my oversoul, follow impulses, act onintuitions, share knowledge, spread love and cooperate with my Higher Self.Click here to view next chapterOr click here to return to the indexchap25.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap25.html (8 of 8) [5/4/1999 9:28:19 AM]"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26Questions and AnswersThere are a few questions that are frequently asked about the out-of-body experience. Here is how Iwould answer them, in no particular order:What do you do during an OBE?Mostly, I explore. I experiment. I have an insatiable curiosity, so I just go out and try things. I also loveto fly.Can you lose your body?If anyone has lost their body, they obviously hadn't lived to tell about it. But all indications are that youcan't lose your body for good. I believe that your oversoul has invested a great deal of time and energy increating and maintaining a physical body for a purpose. Your oversoul is not going to give up your bodyuntil your purpose has been fulfilled. Thousands of people have experienced OBEs, and wanderedthousands of miles away from their body. After a certain period, they usually just lose consciousness andfind themselves back in their body again.What about possession?Perhaps if you have mediumistic tendencies, spirits can temporarily inhabit your body while you are out.However, spirits cannot possess your body long-term unless you give them permission to do so. Myclairvoyant friend, LD, told me of an OBE where a spirit of a woman entered her body withoutpermission. The woman was trying to animate LD's body, but couldn't. LD returned to her body to find itoccupied. She was so angry that she yelled at the spirit to get out \"or else.\" The spirit said no, but LD gotfurious and yelled \"Now!\" The unhappy spirit quickly left the body, and LD entered it again. The pointis, even when you are out of your body, your oversoul has a \"claim\" on that body. Other spirits do nothave the power to animate your body.Can you encounter something evil like a demon?I don't believe in evil. There are only two kinds of demon: The first kind is the demon we create from ofour own fears. If you don't believe in evil, you cannot encounter these demons. If you understand andface your fears, you can face these demons and destroy them with an act of will. The only thing you haveto fear is fear itself.The second kind is the spirit of a dead person who is playing the role of a demon to make him/herselfappear more intimidating. But that's different from evil. Remember this: They are just a spirit like youand me. They have no more power than you do, despite how they look or act. If you are a gentle soul,just visualize a white light around the spirit and send feelings of love to the poor misguided spirit. Ifyou're ornery, tell them to stick it where the sun doesn't shine, and walk away.

They can't harm you, and they can't possessyour body unless you give them power over you by being afraid.What are the psychological effects? Can you go insane?Again, I can only speak from personal experience. One common definition of \"sane\" is when a person isan integrated person functioning normally in society. I can say this much: I haven't had any problemsholding a job. As a computer programmer and analyst, stress levels are high and my brain functions areconstantly being taxed. My OBEs haven't done any noticeable harm.There is an excellent book called With the Eyes of the Mind by Gabbard and Twemlow that contains anin-depth study of the psychology of OBEs. It compares the OBE to other psychological phenomena. Inshort, they found that the OBE shouldn't be grouped with psychological disorders such as dissociation,schizophrenia, autoscopy and other body boundary disturbances. OBE falls into a category of its own.When is the best time to practice?The best time to practice is in the morning, when you are awake, refreshed and not likely to fall asleep. Imostly practice Saturday and Sunday mornings because I can sleep in late, wake up refreshed and thenhave plenty of time to practice. I also recommend you take a nap sometime during the day, and use thattime to attempt to leave your body. Naps are better than bedtime, because you're usually not as tired. Youcan relax and really get into it, without being so tired that you just fall asleep right away. If you onlypractice before bedtime, make sure to go to bed early so you won't fall asleep immediately.What's the difference between an OBE and a lucid dream?Some people believe that OBEs are the same thing as lucid dreams. It's easy to confuse the two. I'm notan expert in the field of lucid dreams, but I can offer my opinions. Lucid dreams seem to come in twocategories: The first type of lucid dream happens during the onslaught of sleep. It is possible that theseexperiences are actually OBEs. The second type of Lucid dream occurs during REM (Rapid EyeMovement) sleep, which researchers acknowledge as the \"dream\" state. Scientists have developed a fewcommercial devices that monitor the eyelids of a dreamer. When REM sleep is detected, the machineflashes a light or sends another signal to the dreamer. When the dreamer recognizes the signal, they canwake themselves to a fully conscious lucid dream.Studies have shown that OBEs do not occur during REM sleep. From personal experience, I can say thismuch: I have experienced them both, and have seen the difference. Lucid dream scenery seems \"fake\"when compared to OBE scenery. In lucid dreams I realize the scenery is \"fake\" and can make the scenerydissolve, leaving me floating near my body.What's the difference between meditation and OBE?In some forms of meditation, the goal is to clear your mind of all thoughts, which is very similar toquiescing your mind for an OBE. Some people report accidentally leaving their body during meditation.Others go into a state of meditation when trying to induce an OBE, but never leave their body.When I meditate, my mind becomes empty, and I go into a kind of trance that I can't explain.

I don't have dreams or hypnogogic images. It is as ifthe world has completely stopped, and my consciousness has been extinguished. When I come back frommeditation, I have no memories.When I induce an OBE, I don't induce nearly as deep a trance. I retain a thread of alert consciousness thewhole time. Once I reach the OBE state, my consciousness becomes normal again. After the experience,I have complete memories of the experience.How do I know if it was real?My general rule of thumb is: If you're not sure, then it was not a real OBE. A true OBE should leave youwith no doubt in your mind. In a genuine OBE, you should literally feel as if you are separate from yourbody. It won't seem like a dream, a daydream, a visualization, or a fantasy. It will feel absolutely real.Is consciousness as clear during an OBE?In an OBE, as in life, consciousness can be crystal clear or muddy. I've had OBEs where myconsciousness was more intense than normal waking life. I've also had OBEs where my thinking wasmore \"muddy.\"What's the difference between OBE and Near Death Experience?This is how I think of it: The out-of-body experience is one typical feature of a Near Death Experience(NDE). Typical NDEs have some other common features that aren't usually found in an OBE (althoughthat doesn't mean they can't happen). Some of these features are: Gliding down a tunnel, having your lifeflash before your eyes, seeing a bright light, meeting dead relatives or friends and being told it is \"notyour time.\"Also, NDEs usually happen during times of bodily trauma. OBEs often happen from a state of perfecthealth.Has anyone seen God, Jesus, etc., during an OBE?It is more common to see deities during NDEs rather than during OBEs. It's interesting to note that whenthis happens it seems to be based on the person's religious convictions. Christians tend to see Christ.Buddhists tend to see The Buddha. Hindus tend to see their deities. I believe there is only one God.Perhaps certain powerful spiritual entities on the other side can appear in a form makes the participantmost comfortable. Personally, I've never seen a deity during an OBE, except the childhood experience inchapter 2.When you leave your body, aren't you technically dead?chap26.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap26.html (3 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:28:44 AM]"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Why doesn't brain damage or rigor mortis occur?Your body does not die during an OBE. It goes into a deeply relaxed state.Is OBE related to UFO phenomena?Many victims of \"alien abductions\" describe symptoms similar to OBE phenomena. They describetunnels, vibrations, weird sounds and sights and total paralysis. They describe how aliens appear out ofthin air beside their beds or walk through walls. Victims are levitated out of bed and are pulled outsidethrough the wall. I believe many such victims are merely misinterpreting symptoms of typical OBEs. Ithink a lot of \"abductees\" would be relieved to know the true nature of their experiences!I must also add that not all claims of alien abduction can be dismissed as OBEs. Some UFO cases havecompelling physical evidence that wouldn't be left after an OBE.Can you inhabit the body of a medium while OBE?Around 1903, an invalid by the name of Vincent Turvey learned how to induce OBEs to free himselffrom his disabled body. Spiritualism was still popular then, so Turvey started visiting seances during hisOBEs. A few times he actually sent messages through the medium during the seance. In his book, TheBeginnings of Seership, Turvey has signed testimonials from people who were present at these seances. Ibelieve him because he had witnesses and because he was too physically ill to stage such elaboratehoaxes. I've never tried it, and I don't know of anyone who has, other than Turvey. But I believe it can bedone.Is there a such thing as astral sex?I've read about astral sex in only a few books. The following experience, which I labeled a lucid dream atthe time, is the closest I've been.03/08/83 ThuLast night I had an interesting experience that I'd like to share. Last night before I went tosleep at midnight, I prayed to God. I asked to have an experience where I would reach mysoulmate through a dream....Some time in the middle of the night I found myself in adreamlike state and was semi- conscious. I was not in a recognizable place. I was with awoman with light hair, and I don't know if she was my soulmate or not. We got very close toeach other, and just before we embraced I became conscious in the sense of a lucid dream.The intensity of the experience is what caused me to be conscious. We embraced and at firstI thought we were hugging. Then her body became less defined and started melting intomine. I was surprised and my body started melting too! As we melted into each other,energy started shooting out in all directions with the intensity of the sun.I can't remember any more.chap26.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap26.html (4 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:28:44 AM]"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"What do you see when you look in a mirror?The following is an OBE where I looked into a mirror. What I saw was surprising.12/25/85 - OBE #121...I stayed in bed, practicing OBE. I used the rock-my-consciousness method to loosenmyself from the body, but I felt somewhat attached to it, even as I was swinging away. Onone outward swing, I twisted to my left, reached out with my astral arms, grabbed onto thebed and pulled myself completely out of my body. I paused there, crouched down on mybed, looking at the drapes on the bedroom window. Everything looked normal from thatpoint of view.I had been planning to try to visit CRA, and I paused to think about visiting her. I thought,\"There's plenty of time for that. First, I want to experiment a little bit.\" My eyes were closedbecause of the previous two OBEs.I paused, trying to think of a good experiment. \"I know,\" I thought to myself, \"I'll trylooking into a mirror!\" As soon as I thought that, I felt a strange shift of consciousness and Iopened my eyes.I found myself in a strange room with a mirror. I walked over to the mirror and looked at it.At first I saw my own image, but without a beard--I only had a moustache. I thought tomyself how much I looked like BA (CRA's husband). My image slowly turned into BA'simage and I thought, \"Hmm. Maybe I'm a counterpart of BA. But I have a beard and amoustache, and my image doesn't reflect that.\" I looked into the mirror again, trying to fixthe image. I noticed the image wasn't smiling; it had a very serious look on. So I smiled intothe mirror and watched my image change.My image changed slowly into the image of a woman I've never seen before, and thenslowly turned into an image of DS, smiling! (DS is a member of our discussion group). Ithought, \"Whoa! That's not me. I wonder if DS is a counterpart too!\" I bid DS's imagefarewell, and looked into the mirror and saw myself. This time I looked normal in allrespects. I was smiling, and I noticed I was wearing the same clothes my body had on inbed. I thought, \"Good.\"I wondered whether I should visit CRA, or do another experiment. I tried to think of otherexperiments I could do, but I lost consciousness and immediately came to in my body.This story had an interesting aftermath. Here is what I wrote in my journal the next day. The next day, Inarrated the OBE to the discussion group and BA was there. As nearly as we could tell, BA was justgetting up and dressing during my OBE. He most likely was in the bathroom looking at a mirror! Wasthe image I saw of him real?How long does it take to learn?This varies from person to person. Some books claim to be able to teach you to leave your body in 30days or less. But that depends on a lot of factors, like the reader's belief system, how often they practice,chap26.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap26.html (5 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:28:44 AM]"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"the methods they try, and their attitudes during practice.Some people have tried for ten years or more before having their first OBE. Others have done it on theirfirst try. Don't be discouraged if you don't get results for several months. Everyone can learn this skillwith practice and patience.What's a typical OBE practice session like?On a typical practice session, I will wake up naturally around 6:30am. I'll get up, visit the bathroom, thendrink something with caffeine. I'll stay up for about a half hour to clear my mind. I'm usually too tired atthat hour, so I'll go back to bed and sleep for another sleep cycle. Around 7:30am, I'll wake up naturally,stretch and start my first attempt. After about twenty minutes of trying, I will give up, roll over and goback to sleep.When I wake up from that sleep cycle, I'll make my second attempt. Again, I'll keep at it for about twentyminutes before giving up. I'm usually successful on my second or third attempt. If I'm not successful by11:30am, I quit practicing.How long does it take to induce an OBE?Typically, it takes around fifteen to twenty minutes to induce an OBE. My fastest induction took aroundthirty seconds. My longest induction took more than an hour.What's the most common mistake during practice?The most common mistake people make is trying too hard. Many people try so hard to induce an OBEthat they never reach that totally passive state of mind I mentioned in chapter 24, step 2. If you \"try hard\"instead of letting go, you'll never be able to quiesce your mind enough to induce an OBE.Why do it? What is it good for?I believe there are many good reasons to induce out-of-body experiences. It may help us prepare for theafterlife, and uncover the secrets that lie beyond death's door. And that, in turn, can bring a betterunderstanding and appreciation for life; We gain the realization that life is, after all, only temporary.After an OBE or two, there is no longer a fear of death. Also, it may help us develop psychic abilities. Itmay also help us contact departed loved ones. Perhaps in the future, we can use it to explore the farreaches of space, or the depths of the oceans. Or maybe to find missing children and to catch criminals.Besides, it's fun. Most important, OBEs can help us to be more spiritual. We can find our own answersinstead of relying on religion, superstition and dogma. We can explore our own inner space and discoverour inner selves. Maybe we can experience our true oversoul, or superconscious self. Perhaps we mayeven reach Ecstasy, Satori, Nirvana, Christ-consciousness or whatever you want to call it. Perhaps wecan even experience the divine, the infinite soul, or God. The possibilities are endless.There are still many unanswered questions about the out-of- body experience. It seems like the more Ianswers I find, the more questions pop up.chap26.htmlhttp://www.winternet.com/~rsp/chap26.html (6 of 7) [5/4/1999 9:28:44 AM]"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"EXERCISE 26Side-to-side SwayingThis is similar to the method described in chapter 24. Lie down with your arms by your side. Relax yourbody to the point where you can no longer feel your arms. As vividly as you can, imagine that your armsare stretched out perpendicular to your body (not by your side). Hold that feeling and simultaneouslyslow down your mind into that quiesced state mentioned in chapter 16. If you find it difficult to reach thispoint, your body is probably not relaxed enough. You should be so relaxed that you do not feel yourphysical arms at your side. Do not continue until it feels like your arms are outstretched. Hold your mindin that quiesced state.Then visualize that both hands are holding onto handles that are anchored. Hold that visualization until itis stable.Next, visualize that you flex your right outstretched arm just a tiny bit, which pulls your body slightlytoward it. This imagined movement of your body should start out very small, approximately onemillimeter. Your physical body should not move (if it does, start over.) Then flex your left arm, pullingyour body back to the left.Again, flex your right arm, then your left arm to \"sway\" your body slightly from side to side. Keepflexing your arms right- left-right-left. As you do, develop a rhythm to your swaying. Each flex shouldonly take half a second to achieve, so a complete cycle of right-then-left should take approximately onesecond to complete.Continue to hold this swaying pattern for about thirty seconds (the exact amount of time isn't important),then slowly start to increase the amount of pulling. Over about four minutes, increase the amount ofswaying to about six inches per side. At that point, the vibrations are likely to hit you. Ignore them andkeep swaying for about ten more seconds. Then you will be free from your body.
