In doing this, I have eliminated the fluff and padding which is normal in book and tried to keep everything to the essentials. I am not a follower of any one system, so I have picked the best techniques from many systems so you can have the best of the best. Some of the articles are short. And, very rarely, some are complicated. You can read this book in any way you wish because each article is intended to be self contained. You can look for the articles that you need today, and read the others later. My wish for you, the reader My wish is that you, the reader, will find a technique that you need today to help you in your life and read the article very carefully so you really understand it and can use it. Try out the new techniques with small problems to begin with and work your way up. I also wish that you will return many times to these pages to refresh your knowledge, and get a better understanding after you have practiced and observed the techniques in use. This book contains a wealth of information from many sources. It is expressed in the briefest and shortest way possible. In this way you can get the information you need quickly and easily. It does mean, though, that you need to read the articles slowly and carefully to get the skills and abilities that you require. I wish you “bon voyage” in your voyage into self development, and I hope this book takes you some way in your journey.

Many years ago, a friend and I were extremely amused by something that happened. The event became associated with the expression 'windscreen wipers'. An anchor had been made between the amusing incident and the phrase “windscreen wipers”. Afterwards, whenever we or anyone else said, 'windscreen wipers', we would burst out laughing. Our pointless laughing at the word “windscreen wipers” annoyed others who could not 'see' the joke. Bursting out laughing when one or the other of us said, 'Windscreen wipers' seemed crazy to other people! The windscreen wipers had become associated with something amusing, and thereafter, whenever we said, “windscreen wipers”, it made us laugh just as the incident made us laugh in the past. Has something similar ever happened to you? Have you ever associated things in some irrational way? We all have thousands of these experiences, although we might not be aware of them all. We might even consider them rational! In the story above, the neutral phrase 'windscreen wiper' had become anchored to a state of amusement. Whenever we wanted to laugh again, we had only to say 'windscreen wipers.' Windscreen wipers became a trigger for evoking laughter, by anchoring a state of amusement with the phrase. Actually, this anchor still seems pretty funny to me today, many years later, which shows that anchors can remain effective years later. Any sound, object, picture, smell, feeling or sound can become anchored to a past state. After being anchored, the words, etc, evoke emotions, thoughts or states, etc. Designer Anchors Anchors can be created accidentally, but can you create them to order? If you can, then you can learn to control your experience. You can use anchors to deliberately bring experiences under conscious control and produce their effects whenever you need them. For example, if you need to be confident, you can make an anchor to give you that confidence when you need it. For example, you might feel nervous about a meeting, such as a job interview, and you want to be confident. Here's how you can use anchors to accomplish this! 1. Recall an experience with the resource you require. For example, recall a time when you had the resource, self confidence. 2. When you experience this confidence at its maximum, touch yourself (for example, bring the thumb and forefinger together to make a circle) to anchor self confidence to the touch. 3. Recall, or imagine several other examples of being confident to strengthen your state and apply the anchor as in the previous step. 4. Test the anchor to see whether it evokes the state you want. If not repeat the above steps. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Page - 8 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved In the steps above we used feeling (or touch) to create the anchor. You joined the index finger and thumb to form a circle. You can also use a mental picture or a sound to anchor the state you want. You could, if you wished, use all three! That is you could touch yourself, recall a mental picture and a sound. For example, you could think a word, say the word “confidence”, touch your cheek, and visualize a circle. When you need to evoke the state of confidence, you would apply all the anchors. Anchoring Others You can apply anchors to others using these principles. For example, every time a person is in a good mood, you could cough, or make a subtle sign. You could touch them. You would does this when they were at the height of the resource state. After anchoring the state, you can recreate the state when you want to. For example, you cough and the person is in a good mood. Or if you used a sign, such as stroking your hair, then you could stroke your hair to get the other person in a good mood. When you apply the anchor, you make the sign, sound, etc, in exactly the same way that you did it when to established the anchor. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Page - 9 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved The Magical Authority Voice When we were young, and our parents were angry with us they used the Authority Voice. They dropped their tone at the end of their sentences and we knew they were serious. After years of learning to adopt this serious state when we heard the Authority Voice, none of us can avoid feeling deferent and submissive when we hear it. This voice sounds firm, parental, and in our own best interest. You might understand the Authority Voice better by thinking about how it affects animals. The Voice of Authority affects animals too. Although a dog does not understand human language, it does understand the Voice of Authority. It also knows when we are pleased with it and when we are angry with it. You can learn to recognise the Authority Voice, by listening to how people speak. Do they have a childish whining voice - or, the Voice of Authority? Of course, there are many magical ways for you to express yourself with your voice. The Authority Voice is one way of doing it when you want to command others. For example, in normal speech, our voice naturally rises when we ask a question and it drops when we make a statement. You can practise using the questioning voice with statements when you want to make them more acceptable and the statement voice with questions, to make them more like statements of fact. Listen carefully to how others speak, in real life, in films and on the TV. You will notice many examples of using the voice in this way. Many effective communications depend on how something is said, although normally we are unaware of it. You see, like animals, we respond more to intonation patterns than to meanings! We do this unconsciously. The Authority Voice, for example, is a pattern that automatically puts us in an obedient submissive state. By listening to these patterns and using them consciously, you can greatly improve your communication skills. You can also avoid being influenced irrationally by others who use these patterns. Newsreaders, for example, receive training on how to speak using the Authority Voice because they know that how they say something has greater impact than what they say. If something is said in one voice - the Voice of Authority - then we tend to believe it, but, when the very same thing is said in another voice, we tend to doubt it. It isn’t so much what we say, that acts for or against us, it is the screechy way we say it. You need to practice using the authority voice, because, under stress, our voice tone normally rises and makes us sound childish and weak. If you practise, you can make your voice sound powerful, even when you are nervous. Men, in particular tend to deepen their voice when they are nervous. This is an attempt to use the Authority Voice, but they just sound nervous. Listen carefully to notice the difference. Practise carefully so it sounds right when you need it. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Page - 10 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved When you use the Authority Voice you will automatically become more powerful and influential. Practice by listening to others speaking and note how their voices changes, and what impression it creates. Listen especially to newsreaders! You will then be aware of the trick and you may use it yourself!"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" Page - 11 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Can I Really Be Lucky? Yes, you can be lucky! Luck means occurring by chance, which implies that Luck just happens by chance, and it cannot be planned or obtained by intention. You cannot influence the result of a lottery, or a roll of dice, for example. So you cannot win by wishing or hoping. Yet, apart from this you can be lucky. Here's how! 1. Know what you want. If you don't know what you want, how will you know when you find it? As a young student, I was amazed that after learning a new word, I seemed to see it and hear it everywhere. It was as if the word had suddenly appeared everywhere. Of course, it hadn’t just appeared – it had always been there, but it was only after I had learned it that I noticed it. In a similar way, when we become aware of opportunities, we notice them everywhere? Like my new word, when we feel lucky, we see opportunities everywhere. When we do not feel lucky, we miss them completely. Of course, the opportunities are always there, but we are not aware of them unless we feel lucky. Opportunities of all kinds surround us, but we recognise them only when we feel lucky. 2. Let everyone know what you want! If you let others know what you want, they can pass on to you useful information and tips, but if they don’t know what you want, they obviously can't help you. So step 2 is to let everyone know what you want. 3. Persist, but not for too long If at first you don’t succeed, then try, try and try again, but if it still doesn’t work, then try something else! How many times must you try until you find what will work? We don’t know. Eighty per cent of what we try fails to bring the dramatic results we want. Of the remaining 20 per cent, only 4 per cent will be of much use. People who are successful try many things. They have to, because they don’t know which thing will actually work. They also fail more often than they succeed. In fact, they fail many more times than they succeed. They try, try, and try again, and if it still doesn’t work, they do something else! Give up and try something else, when you have done your best. But give it your best first. 4. Be a lifelong learner I have often heard people talk about their dream, perhaps a new business. Yet many choose something they know nothing about. They do not prepare themselves by learning all they can, before they make the jump! Those who succeed become experts in their area of interest. They read, study, listen and ask questions, and gain experience."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Page - 12 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved 5. Trust your intuition! Respect your hunches and 'feelings.' This does not mean you blindly gamble on a hunch. it means that you listen to your hunches, and consider them carefully, respect them but check them out! Remember many famous scientific discovers derived from sudden hunches or insights. But the scientist then had to prove them! Do not expect that all intuitions will come to you like a flash of lightning. Some of them might come to you gently and quietly. By listening to your intuitions and being aware of them you can open up the opportunities in your life. 6. Believe you will succeed! Many really great achievements did not come overnight. Often they were preceded by many false starts, and difficulties. You need to maintain your faith that you will soon succeed in small things and in time in great ones. Never give up on your dreams! You will succeed sooner than you think! You can be lucky, not by magic or wild dreaming, but by following the tried and tested procedures above. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Page - 13 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved How To Talk So People Listen With Their Hearts Some people are motivated to get pleasure, while others are motivated to avoid pain. We can call the first type “towards” people, and the second type, “away-from” people. Motivating “towards” people “Towards” people are motivated by moving towards pleasure. So, “towards” people find the following statement: ‘The house is a mess and I'd better clean it.' Less motivating than: 'The house is a mess, and, after I've cleaned it, I will be proud of it, so I'm going to feel really good' You give towards people an appealing emotional reason or motive to clean the house. You explicitly state a motive that makes them feel emotionally good. If you are a “towards” person, then you should do the same in your self talk. Use Good Feelings to Motivate “towards” people To use this technique with “towards” people you need to find out what makes them feel good. This means you have to care about people and be interested in them. You need to be interested in them to use it properly. The method is to ask someone to do something and tell them that - after they do it - they will experience good emotional feelings! Here are some examples: I’d better do some studying, or I’ll be in trouble. ! If I do some studying, then I will learn something new and feel I have achieved something. \" I’d better clean the car, otherwise I’ll feel guilty. ! When I have cleaned the car, I shall feel proud of it. \" The first statement above would be motivating to an “away-from” person. It has an “x” because we are considering “towards” people. Here are some more examples: I hate driving over to visit my old aunt, but I have to do it. ! When I have visited my aunt I shall feel good. \" You never do things for me. ! When you have put that shelf up, we can sit down and have a nice rest. It’ll be nice, won’t it? \" I don’t fancy going shopping. We can get your favourite stuff, and when we get back, we can have a nice bottle of wine. \" "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Page - 14 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Here’s how you can do it: 1. Think of the benefits to yourself or to another of doing something. 2. Use benefits rather than obligation, or punishment to motivate you or the other person to do it. Use Pain Avoidance to motivate “away-from” people “Away-from” people are motivated by avoiding pain. You can motivate them by telling them about the pain they will avoid by doing it. Wash the car and you’ll stop being ashamed of it. Visit Auntie and you wont’ feel guilty When I have cleaned the car, I shall feel proud of it. ! I’d better clean the car, because if I don’t I shall feel guilty. \" Did you notice that this is the opposite of the example used for “towards” people? Does this remind you of the proverb, “One man’s meat is another man’s poison”? If so, you are well on the way to achieving your goals. Or should I have said, “You will avoid a lot of problems in life”? Do you see the difference between these two statements? Pleasure AND Pain You can also use both pleasure and pain: Wash the car and you won’t feel ashamed of it. You’ll be able to look at it and admire it. Visit Auntie and you won’t feel guilty. You’ll feel good because she loves to see you. Most of us are probably motivated by moving towards pleasure. Some of us are motivated to avoid pain. Yet others are motivated by both moving towards pleasure and away-from pain. By framing motivating statements in terms of both, we increase our chances of motivating others. Find out what motivates you and what motivates others, and frame your motivators accordingly."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Page - 15 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved The Relaxing Breath Have you noticed that when you feel tense, you sometimes forget to breathe? You think you are having an anxiety attack when, in reality, you just haven't remembered to breathe! This might sound silly, but it is one of the most profound secrets of remaining calm. So when you feel anxious - remember to breathe! (We all feel anxious when we stop breathing!) So this is a quick and easy technique to handle stress: 1. Take a deep breath through the nostrils and be aware of your abdomen expanding. Breathe with your abdomen! 2. When you practise breathing in this way, put your hands on your abdomen and feel it expand as you breathe in. Do this to increase your awareness of how you breathe. 3. Breathe in deeply through the nostrils keeping your shoulders motionless and let the expanding abdomen let the air in. 4. When you have taken a deep breath, then let it out through the mouth noisily, perhaps doing a deep sigh! (Do it quietly, if you are with other people!) 5. Breathe in through the nostrils with the abdomen expanding and breathe out through the mouth noisily. Do this 5 times. 6. Notice how easy and quickly you can relax! 7. Practice doing the power breath so that you can do it easily and quickly when you need to banish stress immediately. There are four essential conditions that you must meet to be stress free, or to reduce stress. They are: 1. Silence 2. Comfort 3. Air 4. Wanting to be calm. Find a quiet place, preferably silent. Of course, too little stress can be just as bad as too much. Yet if you are stressed, you need less stimulation. That means silence...as silent as you can get. Do you feel comfortable? Is your body in an awkward position? Change your position! Check if you have tensed some muscles for no reason? Relax them! Do you feel hot or cold? Hungry? Etc.? Many basic things, such as hunger, temperature, etc, determine whether you feel comfortable or not. I remember one evening I started to tremble, and actually thought I was feeling anxious till I realised I was hungry. Of course, I was stressed, but the reason was lack of food, not lack of psychotherapy! We breathe to live! No wonder we feel stressed when we have too little air and when we breathe improperly. Check whether your breathing has stopped or is too shallow: Breathe deeply? Finally, remember you get calm because you want to! Do you want to be calm? Motivate yourself to feel calm by reminding yourself of the great feeling you will get when you become calm. Isn't it interesting that just pointing out a few obvious things can make all the difference!"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Page - 16 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved When you find their magic words of influence you become irresistible! When we receive information we evaluate it, according to our criteria so we can determine whether it is bad or good, useless or useful, etc. You can use this fact to discover and use another’s criteria, to obtain their enthusiastic agreement. That person's criteria influence them magically and irresistibly. To determine another's criteria ask these question: 1. What makes this important to you? 2. What does this do for you? 3. What would I have to do to (get your business)? 4. What would have to happen for... (you to support me)? Having determined the other's magic words, use these exact words exactly as they have used them to create a powerful influence. If they mispronounce or misuse words, then you should mispronounce and misuse them too - just as they did. When you do this, you can frame your message in a way that is magically irresistible to the listener! Although each of us has our own magic words - which differ from others - there are certain magic words that appeal to most of us. The list given varies but tends to include: New Easy Free Love Health Money Sex These words represent some of the criteria we all share. But our own personal criteria, which we reveal in response to the questions at the beginning of this article, influence us most of all. Discover and use these personal criteria and your communications will be magically irresistible! Are you aware of how easy it is to change when you know how to? "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Page - 17 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved How To Deal With Criticism People criticise us for three reasons: 1. We can do better in some area, for ourselves and for others. 2. The other person has done something wrong to us or to others unjustly. 3. We have done something, which is wrong for ourselves or for others, by harming them unjustly. When the criticism is justified, and we could do better, then we should seek to do better. When another criticises us, they have often done something wrong to us (usually without our knowledge). What they say surprises and confuses us because of the over-reaction or complete fabrication. We mentally search for what we might have done (although we did nothing). Because we turn inwards to search for an answer, we go into a trance. In this state, we recall some bad things we have done (although they might not be that bad!) and this makes us feel worse. The other has concealed their bad acts to us and hurt us more. We should always think: What have you done or said, which you wouldn't like me to find out about? We would say, however: You seem to be upset about something, let's sit down and talk it over. Now what specifically has been annoying you? After you listened to the complaints, ask: We have talked about what I have done wrong. Now I wonder if there is something you'd like to tell me? Where we have done something wrong, which has brought upon us unfair criticism, then we should, where possible own up to what we have done wrong. Of these three types of criticism, the one where we have done nothing wrong and the other has done something wrong against us is the most confusing one."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Page - 18 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved You Must Become a Cybernaut to Steer Yourself Through Life In ancient Greece, the Cybernaut was the person who steered the boat. He got the boat to its destination by keeping it on course. The boat didn't stay on course. It was continually off course. The wind blew it off course. And the waves pushed it off course. The Cybernaut had to continually change the course of the boat to keep it going where he wanted it to go. The boat reached its destination only because someone steered it. A famous acrobat was asked how he kept his balance on a tightrope. He said, he never kept his balance. He was always losing it. When he veered to one side, he leaned to the other. It was a constant struggle to keep from falling off. A body walks a tightrope only because it is carefully controlled, because it is always falling one way or the other. Back to the boat! If you wanted to sail from Sparta to Athens, would you just get on the boat and let it go where it willed? Or would you continually steer it to keep it on course? Which method would lead you to Athens and which would lead you somewhere else, perhaps round in circles, or on the rocks? The answer is obvious, isn't it? Your boat will only reach its destination if someone steers it. So much is really obvious. But do we apply this knowledge in our lives? Do we lead our lives in this way? Or do we hope that something will happen, or that someone will do what we want, (whether for their benefit or ours), so we can get what we want? Unless we do the steering then we will never attain our goals. In life we are constantly failing, and it is only by handling these failures that we keep on course and attain our goals. If we do not continually handle our failures, we will be like the Cybernaut who let his boat go where it floated. What would we say to a Cybernaut who allowed this to happen? Would you say he or she was kind, tolerant and granted freedom of choice by letting the boat go where it wanted, when the boat crashed onto the rocks and sank with all aboard? What about the Cybernaut who steered the ship where he or she wanted to go, a cybernaut who did his own thing, and took us all to Troy when we wanted to go to Athens? This one is better than the previous one. At least we don't end up on the rocks! But the good Cybernaut is one who takes others where they want to go or takes them where they get what they want.

The unwanted state no longer exists. Have you ever had the experience of suddenly being amazed because you saw something in a different way? Did the experience momentarily stop you in your tracks? Did you have different emotions too? Did you notice how something changed in your body when this happened? These are the first three items that show us that a process has worked. There is a fourth item. The unwanted condition no longer exists. You are free of it for good! When you think or experience the matter again, your reactions to it have changed. However, sometimes we are quite happy with a short distraction or relief, especially when solving the matter completely will take some time. This too is a sign that the process has worked.

Developing the tranquil mind by calming your eyes! One of the secrets of life is to keep a tranquil mind. Be at peace inside, whatever is happening outside. The most successful negotiators are those who can keep a quiet mind. The most able problem solvers can keep a peaceful, unruffled, calm mind. The best communicators can keep a peaceful, unruffled, calm, mind. The only way to manage a situation in which anger flames and harsh words fly is to keep a quiet peaceful, unruffled, calm, and tranquil mind. Let others yell, and scream and rant, while you maintain a state of peace, deep relaxation and calm. Calmly thinking in a peaceful way how you can solve your problem. Easily said, but how can we do it? Within any confusion, you can remain like the eye of the hurricane, at peace and in control while the whizzing and whirling of the things in front of you have no power to affect you without your agreement. How to Calm your Eyes One of the key techniques – one that affects the whole of your being - is one that concerns the eyes. We have tended to forget in this modern world that the eyes have long been thought to have magical properties. The eyes affect, not only outer vision, but also our inner vision, therefore they affect our minds. By looking at a person’s eyes, you can tell what they are thinking or feeling. In grief, the eyes look down. In fear they flit around searching for danger. In anger they fix and pierce the object of anger. Tense eyes sometimes cause and always escalate mental moods and feelings. By becoming aware of the way your eyes affect your emotions, you can control your emotions by controlling your eyes. Mentally command your eyes to relax. Mentally say, 'Relax!' Yes, that's it. 'Relax!' Make them blank. Blank out all eye tension. Imagine seeing, in your mind's eye, your eyes being blank, deadpan, lifeless, inscrutable and unresponsive - so relaxed they are almost asleep. So wooden they are like a heavy log, without tension and totally unresponsive. How can you react emotionally with those unresponsive, sleepy eyes? No response at all! Now do you notice how your thoughts and your body follow suit? How you think, 'I'm not interested in this.’ 'This doesn't affect me at all.' How your body begins to"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Page - 21 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved relax all on its own, and in some strange way, you let go and release whatever it was that held your attention in that unwanted way? You release whatever caused you tension or upset naturally and automatically, without even trying? Have you noticed this? When your eyes are in this state they cannot cause or escalate emotions like anger, fear, panic, turbulence, etc. They turn off these unwanted emotions. By starting with the physical eyes, and blanking them out, you find that your thoughts follow automatically and so do your emotions. Do remember that unwanted emotions can also be pleasant. You can use the same technique. How can, for example, a cream cake be so enticing through these blanked out, deadpan, lifeless, inscrutable eyes? So sleepy, and so uninterested! Whenever you begin to feel tense, whether this is an unpleasant feeling, or a pleasant feeling of excitement you do not want, then begin by relaxing your eyes You will feel physically relaxed You will feel mentally relaxed You will be at peace, with a tranquil mind When your eyes are relaxed, your mind will become calm. Sometimes, you might pay attention to your breathing and breathe slowly, slowly, in a deep relaxed way. You might also look mentally over your body and if a part which is tense then consciously relax it. You might fail to notice how the way you are sitting is making you tense. Scan your body from head to toe and relax all the tense parts. Then calm your eyes. In this way you do the opposite of escalation, and bring your whole being into a state of peace and tranquillity. So: 1. Relax, blank-out, your eyes 2. Breathe in fully, and out with a relaxing sigh. 3. Relax your body 4. Repeat the above to maintain a state of tranquillity.

After all, if you don't know what you want, how can know that you have attained it? Experts tell us that those who set goals do so much better than those who don't. Yet many of us become confused when asked to state our goals. Our minds go blank. And all this talk of goal setting and goal getting just seems so tedious. Well - at last - we can take another approach. Now, let's get going and set some goals by using one or more of the following techniques: What don't you want in your life? At work? At home? If you take the opposite of what you don’t want, then you have got a list of goals. Instead of saying goals, say results. What results do you want from your life? Does changing “goals” to “results” make a difference? Can you think of another word more suited to you? For some of us it makes a big difference! Make a list of the results you want! Suppose you had all your concerns met. Imagine this now. What would you do in your life different from what you do now? Write these down as your list of goals, or results. If you could do anything you wanted to do – if there were no barriers at all, then what would you do? As usual, make a list. Think of areas of your life you might consider. For example: Health, Wealth, Love, Relationships, Work, Education, Spiritual, etc. Use all the above techniques (1 to 4) in these areas and write down your list. Write your epitaph!

You know what you want, or you know what you don't want, so you have a list of goals. Now how are you going to attain them? One approach is to relax, be quiet, breathe well and close your eyes. Imagine you are now at a time when you have attained your goals. Ask yourself the following questions 1. How did you attain your goal? What specifically did you do? Let the answer come easily and naturally. 2. How did you overcome any barriers to attaining your goal? Perhaps you had to overcome procrastination, the opposition of other people, or whatever. What did you do to overcome the barriers? 3. How long did it take you to attain your goal? Did you realize that now, in your imagination, you have attained your goal. How did you know you had attained it? What signs did you see that indicated you had attained your goal? For example, if you want to be self-confidence, how do you know, now, in your imagination, in this future time, that you have now achieved self-confidence? What do you see, hear, or feel ... that tells you for sure you have attained that goal? If you want a million pounds, did you have to have a million or did you say you'd attained your goal when you had 900,000, or did it have to be 1,100,000, just to be sure? How did you know you had attained your goal? Be specific about your goal. What exactly are you now, as you imagine you are in the future? Or what are you doing now that you didn't do in the past, now? Or what do you have, now, or what relationships do you have now, which you didn't have in the past, which is now? How does your goal fit in with your life? Is it what you really wanted? What are the reactions of others? What do they say? How do they react? Allow your mind, or your unconscious mind to supply you with the answers. Be gentle. If you don't get your answers now, then you can put the questions on the back boiler and try the exercise later. When you have explored the future and looked back at the past (which is your present, now) you can easily bring your attention back to the present and make notes on your goal. This technique helps you deal with the future as if it were the present and to use your memory to access what you need to know. This makes the difficult matter of looking into the future easy, by pretending it’s the past.

(Really) I knew it would be an awful day the second I woke up. The milk missed my corn flakes and spilt over the table. The news was terrible on the breakfast TV. Looks like Russia and America are threatening to get into armed conflict again. Avalanches in the ski resorts. Rotten world. The mailman was rude, and the neighbours surly. I got into the car and I thought it would never start. And the other road users: Maniacs! They shouldn't be allowed on the roads. And when I got to work everyone was in a foul mood. But then I started thinking. It was as if some evil magician had cast a spell on people who yesterday were friendly and pleasant, and today they are completely ill mannered louts! Mm! Who is this magician? These people were all right yesterday. And the world didn't seem so bad. So what has changed? Who, dare I ask, has changed? Could it be something to do with me? Could I be in a bad mood? No. Of course not! Well, perhaps a little bit. Can Analysis Cause Conflict? There seems to be an issue of conflict in life and the world. To make an enemy, one has to make an opposite or an opposition. We have to make an 'us' and a 'them'. What is all this talk about 'making'? Aren't these people like this? Aren't we nice people and aren’t they bad? Surely we don't make all this up! Surely governments and groups in society don't create in their minds this opposition? No. Of course they and we don't. Or do we? Let's look at this. Surely conflict is a very important subject. So let's generalise and scan! What's one of the greatest skills we prize in the West? What about analysis? Mm! Isn't it nice to be described as someone with great analytical ability and discernment? But what is analysis? Isn't it the ability to create differences, the ability to separate and examine how things are different? But isn't separation and difference also how we create conflict? If others are like us, we can't dislike them too much, can we? But if others are unlike us, doesn’t that mean we dislike them? It seems that creating conflict and analysis have some similarities. Yet analysis is our way of understanding the world, isn’t it? It is a wonderful way to understand the world. Consider the wonder of human creation (or any sexual creation.) Two cells crash into each other and then the marvellous process of division occurs. They split, split, and split until a baby is produced with all the wonderful different parts. So nature is in some way similar to analysis. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Page - 27 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Even our senses depend on being able to note similarities and differences. We can never perceive anything unless we perceive it as different from other things. If you can’t distinguish a white square from its background, then you can’t see a white square. A white square on a white background is just a white background! We need some difference between the figure and its background to see it. And in other ways noting differences is helpful to us. Suppose you have a phobia of something. Let's say this is because of some bad experience or several in the past. If you distinguish the present from the time you had the problem, say as a child or baby, aren't you going to feel better about the thing in present time? After all it's harmless. Did you forget you are a big adult now and imagined threats to you as a baby, are nothing to you now? By noticing the differences we can all improve ourselves. So there we go. That's how the world is. We learn about it by analysis and by showing discernment. We note similarities and differences. We can be more and more aware of the different bits that make up our world and experiences. Oneness But is the world made up of similarities and differences? Or is there something about us that makes the world appear to made up of similarities and differences? Don't those Eastern gurus or Western mystics speak of unification? Don't they talk about oneness? And don't we use these words when we talk about resolving conflict? There appears to be a conflict between unity and difference, doesn’t there? People that talk about one thing versus another sometimes talk about polarity and polarising. You know, the world has two poles - the North Pole and the South Pole. They are opposites. When we polarise, we separate things and make opposites. This is also similar to the mental skill of analysis, which we prise so much. So where are we now in our discussion? It certainly seems there are a lot of opposites in everything we view. And viewing itself presupposes opposites - figure and ground. Can it be that we are making up all these opposites and oppositions? Mystics talk about unity and unification. Are they saying that we should not discriminate and distinguish, and look for oneness? If that were so, we wouldn't know anything, for the reasons given above. And what is this unification? Is it some merging of two things, which were different, but are now the same? According to mystics the answer is no. Oneness is not the same as merging into one thing. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" Page - 28 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved For example, if we quarrelled and then we made it up and became friends again, we could say we had attained some oneness, but we wouldn't be the same. We wouldn’t have merged into one. Lovers may attain a state of oneness, but they would not be the same - if they were the same and not two people, how could they be lovers! Something Inscrutable So oneness does not seem to be the same as being one indistinguishable thing. Ashvaghosha, the Eastern mystic, said: 'A thing does not really exist, Nor does it not-exist, Nor does it at once exist AND not-exist, Nor DOESN’T it at once exist AND not-exist.' The above statement, by Ashvaghosha, is the most enlightening thing I have ever read and perhaps ever will read. At first all I could do was to marvel at the logic - he seemed to have covered every eventually. After a while I understood it, in various degrees. If you understand this fully, and it is possible you do or will, then you have begun your enlightenment! Remember understanding something means not only remembering it and stating its meaning, but also being able to apply it in both mundane and 'higher' matters. It is at once practical and sublime. Yet it is also the various opposites! Well, that’s some heavy stuff given without apology. Please remember the following: 1. We create conflict, but this does not mean we are at fault or that we should submit. 2. If your day seems bad, reflect on whether you are the great magician who is creating this. And also the great magician who created the good days! 3. Analysis and Discernment are useful skills. There is the downside to this type of thinking, but you will do better by being more analytical and discerning than by trying to merge everything into a false unity. 4. Do not be content with mouthing fine words like unity and unification. Know that by fully understanding you will begin or attain enlightenment, or not! (See Ashvaghosha!) 5. Above all, do not fall into the trap of thinking, for example, that true freedom is slavery, etc., on the belief that true knowledge is unity! 6. Don't use this as an excuse not to pay the rent."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" Page - 29 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Eye directions for various types of thinking According to Richard Bandler and John Grinder, we move our eyes to certain positions depending on whether we are visualizing, listening to sounds, feeling, etc. These eye positions are illustrated below.

This is one special technique to feel good, especially when things are very bad. For example, you hate it at work, but for the time being, you have to go there (for money!). Although this technique is very simple, you might be a bit surprised at its effectiveness. That is, what was previously horrible is now much better. What was impossible seems it just might be attainable. And people, who weren't very nice, don't seem so bad after all. Of course, you can't change the world by changing your thinking, but you can change your world. First imagine yourself having completed the unpleasant activity, for example, just having arrived home from work. See, hear and feel yourself returning home and laughing heartily at the funny things that have happened during the day. Of course, you don't know what they are yet, but you do know what it feels like to be tickled by something. And you do know what you might say to yourself - \"That was funny!\", etc. You also know what you will see when you return home, and what you will hear and feel - for example, the feeling of the steering wheel or the sound of someone saying, \"Hello\", or the engine being switched off. Build up this experience using as many senses as possible. See yourself laughing. Feel the pleasurable emotion. Listen to the pleasant sounds. Be aware of this you - a few hours in the future - having a very enjoyable experience because the unpleasant experience has finished. During the bad time recall yourself in the future having finished the unpleasant activity. Phew! It’s great to have got home! That’s how you will feel a few hours into the future. But why wait? Enjoy the feeling now! When you reach that point in time where you have built this pleasurable experience, for example, having returned home from work, then recall the funny things that have happened and have a good laugh. You don't know what they are yet, but they will be there! In fact, whenever you want to feel good then remember with full mental vision, sound and feeling this image of yourself having a good time thinking back on the funny things that have happened, and feeling relieved that this has finished, at least for today. So to feel good now, imagine a situation in the future when you will feel good. And rather than wait for the future, enjoy it now!"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Page - 32 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Six-step Reframing The following technique is extremely powerful and useful. It was developed by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. 1. Identify the behaviour or response to be changed This is usually, 'I want to do something, but something stops me', or 'I don't want to do something, but I seem to end up doing it just the same.' When working with another, it isn't necessary to know what the behaviour actually is, they can keep it secret, if they like. Acknowledge the good that the behaviour, or at the least the intention behind the behaviour has done for you in the past. Make clear you aren't going to get rid of it. 2. Establish Communication Establish communication with the part that is responsible for the behaviour Go inside and ask the part if it is willing to communicate with you in consciousness? Notice the feelings inside of you. This is an unconscious response, so ask yourself: Can you reproduce that signal consciously? If you can it isn’t an unconscious signal; it is a conscious one! If the response were conscious then it would be easy to turn it off. You could just decide not to do it. For example, when you hear that another has got the job you really longed for, and you want to be decent and congratulate them, but when you do so you feel that sense of discomfort. Can you turn that off? Can you help feeling that way even though you don't want to feel that way? If you can’t, then it is an unconscious signal. Remember: You don’t want a highly unpleasant signal. If traumatic experiences are involved, you might want to use the Phobia Cure instead of Six-Step Reframing. When you have established a communication system. Ask the part to increase the signal for 'Yes' and decrease it for 'No'. Get it to do this several times so you get a 'Yes' and a 'No' signal that are quite clear. 3. Separate the positive intention from the behaviour. Thank the part for co-operating. Ask, 'Will the part which is responsible for the behaviour let me know what it is trying to do?' You will get a clear intention that may be a surprise to your conscious mind. Think whether you want the part to do that. If you get a 'No' signal, you can just assume a positive intention and continue. Or you could ask under what circumstances it would let you know. However, if the part is strongly objecting, then you can leave the issue and try later. Ask the part, 'If you were given ways to accomplish this intention, at least as well, if not better than the present, would you be willing to try them out?' If you get a 'No', your signals are scrambled - no part would turn down an offer like this! Ask it again!"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Page - 33 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved 4. Generate New Behaviour Ask your creative part to generate new ways that will accomplish the same purpose. Ask your creative part to generate as many solutions as it can. You do not need to know what these are consciously. Ask the part being negotiated with to select at least three of these for it to try. Ask it to give you a signal each time it has selected one. Take as long as you need on this part of the process. Thank your creative part when you have finished. 5. Agree to the New Choices Ask the part if it will agree to use the new choices over the next few weeks, rather than the old behaviour. This is future rehearsing the new behaviour. There is no reason why the part should not agree to do this. If you get a 'No', then tell it that it can still use the old behaviour - only use the new behaviour first. If you still get a 'No', then reframe the objecting part (By going back to step 1). 6. Ecological Check Go inside and ask, 'Does any part of me object to the new choices?' If one or more parts object, then check them out by asking the part to intensify the signal. If there are objections then you can reframe the part, by starting this procedure, or ask it to get together with the creative part to find more solutions. Ensure that there are no objecting parts; otherwise, they may try to sabotage the new behaviour later. Summary 1. Identify a problem 2. Identify the part, and get different signals for 'Yes' and 'No'. 3. Get the part's positive intention, and ask it 'If you were given ways of achieving this intention just as well or even better than now, would you be willing to try them out for a week or so?' 4. Ask your creative part to generate many possible solutions (it does not have to find only good ones!) while the part in question gives a 'Yes' signal when there is a solution it thinks it might use. Get at least three. 5. Ask the part if it will try these in the next few weeks. 6. Check that there aren't any objecting parts.

To use this technique you have to plan it. Say, you want another to agree with your proposal and sign the agreement. Let's summarise, I don't know whether you agree with this proposal, you would want to decide before you sign here! Right (Write) on the line! (Strengthen your voice and look the person in the eyes when you say the words in bold.) If you have spoken the words in bold in a different way from usual, then the listeners unconscious mind will hear: 'you agree with this proposal ... you ... decide ... you sign here...' At one level the listener hears the whole speech, but the words said differently are noticed unconsciously and grouped together. Because they are embedded, the commands do not create so much resistance as simply saying them would. A subtler example is: 'This is a bad sign, I can't find my pen. Oh this isn't it. Ah, this will do, or at least be acceptable for now!!' The following are examples of how to “mark” embedded commands: 1. Look the other in the eye as you say the words 2. Nod your head as you say these words 3. Make a sign with your hand as you say these words 4. Open your eyes wider or close them sleepily as you say these words The way that words can be marked can be very subtle indeed! This and other techniques are ways in which we naturally influence each other, without being aware of it."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Page - 35 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Instant replay to win every time! When we make a decision to do or accept something in the past we may follow a procedure and use criteria. We tend to repeat this pattern in the future when we have to make a decision or agree to something. This is the person's strategy for deciding or agreeing. If you know another's strategy for doing this, then you can repeat it and lead them to the same decision. We can also be aware when others are using this on us! Ask: How did you come to... do in the past what you want them to do now...? Or What made you... Or How did you know it was right to... Listen carefully to how they came to make that decision, what the other person did, what procedure they followed. How they decided it was right for them. Follow this procedure in persuading them. 1. In a sales situation, a person might have been 2. Impressed with colour 3. Tried it out, and 4. Talked it over with the family. If you wanted to sell a new one, you'd work to follow this procedure too. You would find an impressive colour, let them try it out, and encourage them to talk it over with the family. That is, you would repeat their last procedure. Although it is better to use an example where they were delighted with the results, an example where they weren’t happy may work as well, because we tend to repeat our good choices as well as our mistakes!

Have you ever noticed that they got into trouble, because they didn't listen? Have you ever read a good idea, but did not take it on board? You did not take it to heart. We can learn things and know things without making them part of us. For example, a criminal psychologist may learn about criminals without becoming a criminal, and this, of course, is good. But in personal development, we want to take the ideas on board and make them part of ourselves. How else could they be useful to us? We can take on board certain ideas by: 1. Repetition. 2. Hypnosis. 3. Using presuppositions. Have you ever watched an advertisement many times until you involuntarily find yourself humming the tune, or using the phrase? Did you learn this because you heard it so many times that you just knew it? This is a lazy way to learn, isn't it? Similarly, by repeating mantras or success phrases, and listening to tapes many times we eventually take the message to heart. Copying We can also learn to difficult things by copying them. At first we may have no understanding of what we are doing. After several or many copies or repetition we start to get an idea of what we are doing and begin to understand it. Some people think they cannot do unless they understand first. Often, by doing, we learn to understand. Through copying we can learn to do and to understand! Did you forget that many great writers and artists learned their craft through copying the works of others? Hypnosis Another method is hypnosis. Some people think that hypnosis works because the hypnotised person just listens without evaluation or invalidation, so the information is taken on board without resistance. Whatever the reason, we can learn using this method. Presuppositions You can also introduce new knowledge by using presuppositions or assumptions. You do not say what you want to know directly, but presuppose it. One way of doing this is to use questions that presuppose the facts you want to convey to yourself or to others. The easiest way to use presuppositions is to put them in questions.

Of course you do. Here the word feel has a sensory meaning. But when we use it in the sentence, Do you feel that this is right, it means think. On other occasions we use feel to mean emotional feeling. Clearly the word feel can be highly ambiguous! If you touch someone and ask him or her if they felt it, they must agree. We can use this truth and ambiguity of 'feel' to make highly effective influence. Here's how. \"Start a sentence with Do you feel that\" and touch or brush them slightly on the hand or arm and then finish the sentence with what you want them to do. For instance, 'Do you feel that (touch them) we are going to make the deal now?' \"You can also use Don't you feel that \" and as before touch them gently somewhere innocuous, such as the hand or arm. Then finish the sentence as before with what \"you want them to feel, decide or do. For example, Don't you feel that (and touch \"them) we should do something about it? Research has indicated that most people are not even aware consciously that they have been touched physically, yet they are effectively influenced.

Metaphor underlies many of our communications. We compare something we wish to express with something we can see or experience. For example, a very common metaphor is that of war: Boardroom battles, Battle of the Sexes Fighting for Your Rights Giving her a Blasting Destroying the Opposition This is a Minefield You get the idea! If the idea of war and battle underlies our interactions, what do you think will happen? What will happen to your body, its stress level? What will happen to your communications? Does this metaphor have the seeds of destruction for everyone concerned? After all, in a real war, no one really wins. Using the language of war can make things sound exciting, but do we pay too high a price for our pleasure? Choose your words well, and be on the alert for words that may make problems more difficult. The images of battles and wars, used so often, may make problems and conflicts much more difficult to handle. We often use these words automatically and without thought. The metaphors we use influence us in a hidden way, and sometimes make our lives difficult because the metaphor is stressful, causes conflict, and obscures solutions. What metaphors do you use that, on thinking about it, you would prefer to change? 1. In your personal life 2. At work 3. When relaxing 4. With your family 5. Etc? Does the metaphor cause problems, or presume an undesirable state? For example, war presumes conflict and violent solutions. The important point here is to be aware of metaphors and their roles in our lives. Is there a better metaphor? If so, begin to translate from the language of the old metaphor into the new and determine whether this is likely to make better situations. Although it might not be possible to use only positive metaphors, we can learn to recognise them and be aware how they might cause problems. You might choose to use neutral language if you cannot think of an appropriate new metaphor.

This is a hidden technique of influence. You can affect anyone with this technique, without their knowledge, and they may be affecting you with it without yours! You can learn this technique to influence others and know when they use it to influence you. Here's how: Mirror their Breathing, Body posture, Voice, Speech Rate Inflection and Speak at the rate they are breathing, saying your most important words when they are exhaling. How do you know when they are inhaling and exhaling? When someone is talking they are exhaling, when they stop they are inhaling. So, when they are talking you should be breathing out, and when they stop talking (for a gasp of breath!) You should breathe in. How do you tell whether they are inhaling or exhaling when they are not talking? Look at their shoulders (not at their chest!!!) and notice the rise and fall of their shoulders against the background. Try looking at them at different angles, to determine what is best for you. When you speak at the rate they are breathing, using the same tone of voice as they are, you are irresistible. It is as if you are their own unconscious mind speaking to them. As you breathe in rapport with them, begin to experience the emotion you want them to feel. Gradually turn it up. Eventually, you will have created in them a state of extreme excitement, or whatever emotion you wished to create in them. Or another may have done the same to you! So make sure you learn this technique! 15 Seconds to Mirror and Match! When matching the posture and mannerisms of another it is important to wait about 10 seconds or more before you match, otherwise the technique may be obvious. Get the idea of how long this is! Ten seconds is about the time we listen and wait when we hear a strange sound, and we wait to find out more. If we hear nothing else, we tend to forget what we heard before. So if the other person scratches their nose, wait about 10 seconds before you duplicate this and mirror their behaviour. In this way, they will not feel your are mimicking them.

You can use it to solve many issues. This is information about open and closed questions. Broadly, a closed question is one that can be answered by one word or phrase or a platitude. It is a conversation stopper. As such it is very useful and important. Open questions are ones that cannot be answered by a single word or phrase, and invite the other to talk - to volunteer new information. Of course, the other can respond to a closed question with a long speech, and the other can respond to an open question with a single word or phrase, or grunt! But open questions get new information more often than closed ones. Closed Questions Are you all right? Is this the right way to do this? Are you interested in films, or do you prefer sport? Open Questions You appear upset. Let's sit down and talk about it? How, exactly, do you do this? Tell me about you favourite sport. Use closed questions to finish a conversation or part of a conversation. Use open questions to get the other to speak more. Question Tags Question tags are little phrases tagged on the end of sentences, to make them questions. For example: It’s a nice day, isn’t it? They won’t come now, will they? She didn’t like it, did she? Question tags can be used to get agreement, aren’t they. And because of this, you will watch out for them, won’t you? They tend to cause an automatic agreement, don’t they. And, of course, you noticed that you can over do them, didn’t you? When you use them wrongly, the listener tends to consciously react to the error, and unconsciously swallows the whole sentence without evaluation, didn’t he?

This is nothing so serious that it requires a medical visit, but it is something that bothers the person concerned. A person has an experience that is often called a traumatic memory, which causes them problems whenever they encounter some situations. Some doctors and nurses might be upset by some illnesses or accidents, for example. Let’s take an example. Say Kathy is afraid of snakes. Kathy isn’t mentally ill; in fact she is extremely competent, except where snakes are concerned. Kathy immediately loses her cool, even at the thought of snakes. Another person might be upset by some grating sounds. Yet another might have heard a story of something horrible and every time they think of it, the have a reaction. It is a reaction to something specific. This reaction might be related to a traumatic incident, as in the case of a policeman who attends a particularly gory incident. Or there might be no incident involved, so far as the sufferer can recall. Kathy, for example, thinks she has always had this reaction to snakes and cannot recall a traumatic experience. 1. Kathy knows that there are two important ways we can imagine pictures in our minds. In one way she can view the picture as if she were looking at a film in a movie theatre. In this image, she sees herself in the film. This image is said to be dissociated. 2. In another she experiences events where she views them, as if from her own eyes. She does not see herself in the film, but sees only what she would see if she were actually there. This way of viewing images is called associated. In the exercise, the film is watched first in a dissociated way, and then in an associated way, with the film running backwards. Kathy practices the technique with three minor concerns until she can do the phobia cure well, when she takes on the main issue."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" Page - 44 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved The Steps in the Phobia Cure 1. Sitting in the Movie Theatre Kathy imagines she is sitting in a cinema (or movie theatre) looking up at the screen. The screen is blank, with the projector on, but no film is being shown. In her imagination, she is sitting down in the theatre watching the film flickering. 2. Floating up Kathy then imagines herself floating up, out of her body into the projection room. She is looking at herself (sitting in the cinema) through a heavy glass screen, as the self in the cinema is looking at the flickering film. In this step Kathy dissociates herself from the self who is actually experiencing the incident, so she does not feel uncomfortable about it. 3. Running Backwards When she is comfortable with the previous step, Kathy imagines that film of an experience running forward in black and white. Kathy is watching her self in the cinema, who is watching the black and white movie of her experience. She is watching this image in a dissociated manner. 4. Frozen Film Just as soon as the film of the incident ends, the film is frozen at a point after the incident where she is safe. 5. Diving in Kathy then, in her imagination, jumps into the film and it runs backwards, in full colour, as she sees everything that happens through her own eyes. That is, she is associated. 6. Repeat Kathy may repeat the sequence several, or as many as ten times, until the reaction has completely gone. 7. Test Kathy tests it straight away. Because she was afraid of snakes, she finds one she can handle, or finds a picture she can look at. If she were afraid of heights, she would have found the highest building she could find and take the external elevator to the top.

Did you know that if you can get someone to agree three or four times, they will most probably agree automatically the next time? Have you ever found yourself in a 'set' where you answer in the same way as before by habit? So you can see how this works! But how can you get someone to agree with you 100% of the time? Easy. For example, at this moment I am sitting at my computer. I am typing this article. The sun is shining. It's quite hot. In my area it is very quiet. These statements are dross and mundane, aren’t they. Perhaps, but I certainly can't disagree, can I? It is all true. Making statements that the other must agree with (or which you know they will agree with) is called pacing. By commenting on the physical universe, for example, you get 100% agreement because you are referring to what is! If it rains, the other has little choice but to agree that it is raining, hasn’t he! Here are some ways of making agreeable statements. You can describe what you see or hear exactly. You are sitting at your desk. You are looking at me. We have been talking for 3 minutes. You can make general statements that everyone will agree with. For example: Certain thoughts are going through your mind. You are wondering what will happen. You can notice the feel of the chair you are sitting on. You can see certain specific things. You can hear sounds. You can make statements that cannot be proved: Your heart rate has changed. Your blood pressure is now different. You are more relaxed. Your body appears lighter than before. You can make statements which are universally agreed, or agreed within a given culture: Business is business! You didn't get where you are now by being lazy, did you? You don't get something for nothing do you?"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" Page - 46 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved There's a silver lining in every cloud, isn't there – even if its hard to find! By making several of the above type statements and then one you want the listener to accept you can tremendously increase your ability to get agreement. You can get 100% agreement using this technique! Make three or four statement the other must agree with (pacing statements). For example: It's raining, and we could get wet. It's lucky I've got an umbrella, isn't it. Make a leading statement (say what you want). Would you like to share my umbrella? Make some more pacing statements followed by a lead. You don't want to get wet, do you? I've got my umbrella already, haven't I? Come on! Make a pacing statement: The rain's heavy isn't it? Make a leading statement, You can keep dry under my umbrella, can't you? This is both a pace and a lead, because in English this is a both a statement and an implied question – like, 'Have you got any sweets? If the other is following your lead, then you could try several leading statements and drop the pacing. For best results, drop in some paces, though!"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" Page - 47 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Personal Development - What are we trying to achieve? Personal development aims for: Emotional Control Understanding Effectiveness Emotional Control Sometimes we respond in ways that, when we have calmed down, we regret. We get angry, we get upset, we despair, when logically, we wish we had expressed a different emotion. Similarly we get excited and enthusiastic about things, which had we been able to follow our reason, we would not have pursued with such passion. We feel we cannot control or direct our emotions. We are at the mercy of outside or unconscious forces. We wish for the freedom to express appropriate emotions. Instead of having to do certain things to gain pleasure, we wish to gain pleasure by doing appropriate things! This is traditionally the area of psychiatry or religion. Understanding To accomplish any aim we need understanding - the skills, the maps and the (mental) tools. We can know without having the skills to do. Understanding means knowing and doing. This area is traditionally the area of education. Effectiveness Just as lacking skills, knowledge, emotions etc, can be a barrier to achieving personal development, so can a lack of effectiveness. We can know what we want, be able to do it, have the motivation (appropriate emotions) but not the personal effectiveness. Effectiveness can involve personal influence. Personal effectiveness is mainly concerned with the communication, persuasion, and rapport building skills to motivate and enthuse others and to help them understand. This area requires that we understand the skills of manipulation, but it does not mean we have to be more manipulative than other systems. Personal effectiveness involves overcoming the barriers within us too. Effectiveness also involves knowing what is most appropriate. We can do several things, but which is best. This is wisdom and is the area traditionally concerning business. Personal development cannot be fully attained without addressing all these factors. We cannot attain our aim by merely feeling good, although we need to feel good to attain our aim. We cannot attain our aim merely"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" Page - 48 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved through understanding - knowing and being skilful, although we need to have them. Nor can we attain our aim merely through effectiveness, although we cannot attain it without it! I believe that much confusion within the path of personal development arises because we do not acknowledge that all these factors are essential. This does not mean we have to be expert in all of them. Being especially good at one will tend to improve us in the others, just as being very bad in one will tend to hold us back. For example, if we are especially good in understanding, then we may feel good because others turn to us for knowledge. And we may be motivated to learn to be more effective in communicating our understanding. In summary: We need to be in the right state of thinking and emotion, Know how to get into this state, Know what we want, How to do it, and We need to act effectively. The goal of Personal Development Quest is to seek and find 1. Skills and abilities, 2. Knowledge which enables us to attain emotional wellbeing, 3.

Have you noticed how the truth seems to be so powerful that we cannot really believe anything but the truth? For example, if you feel miserable and you think positively, 'I feel great!', it doesn't really work does it? It just isn't true. But what about those occasions when we do accept lying. For example, who knows what will happen in the future? In the next week? In the next hour? Or even in the next second. If you feel negative now, who is to say that you won't feel better in the next second, don’t you? Have you ever felt down and then you had a visitor, or the telephone rang and you felt wonderful! Has that ever happened to you? You fly into a good mood! Yet we often accept the lie: because we feel bad now, we will feel bad in the future! Just because you feel bad now, doesn’t mean you won’t feel good in the next second or two. Actually it is probably true that we cannot feel the same way for more than a minute or two. Do you think you can feel the same way for a long time? If so, try meditating, and notice how difficult it is. Our feeling and thoughts change all the time, we just have to recognise it. Meditation is a constant struggle to keep your mind on one thing for more than a few seconds. So if you feel bad, you can feel good in seconds. You can use the same principles to fly into a good mood whenever you want. In fact, you can use this technique for more or less anything. Here's how: Tell the truth: If you feel unhappy, in pain, angry or whatever, acknowledge this. Say, I feel lousy, or however you feel. Tell the truth: You don't feel how you want at this moment, but who is to say that in the next second, or the next few seconds, you might feel better. You don't believe you will, but you have to admit that it is possible. Tell yourself this truth. I feel unhappy (or however you feel), but I don't know how I will feel in the next second or two. Your subconscious mind believes this because it is true. Mm! Yes it is, isn't it? Then notice how your feelings or states begin to change. Ask yourself, Have I noticed how I am now beginning to feel better? Notice how you do actually feel better. You can find something that feels good – what about your little finger, or your toes? Now that it is true, tell yourself, I am beginning to feel better."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Page - 60 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Don't forget to thank your unconscious mind.

One piece of radioactive metal won't make a bomb. You have to reach critical mass, when there is sufficient material to make a bomb. Less than critical mass, no bomb. Critical mass, and you have a nuclear bomb - need I say more? When you are using Personal Development techniques you do not have to do one or two techniques perfectly. You have to do a sufficient number of things reasonably well, so the law of synergy comes into play - you have attained critical mass - and the effect is more than the sum of the effects of each technique. You get more than you put in! When things go wrong, it isn't that one thing was done wrong; rather a lot of things. Similarly, when things go right, it isn't that one thing was done excellently; rather a lot of things were done reasonably well. Remember it is important to do things as well as you can, but one or two mistakes are not going to ruin the day. Remember synergy and critical mass.

Do you find that thinking about the future is difficult? Many of us do. We find it easier to think about the past than we do what may occur in the future. For those of us who have a fuzzy concept of the future, this technique works wonders! You can use it to: Explore goals, Solve problems, or Evaluate how you would like things to turn out, such as changing your job. 1. Sit quietly and breathe relaxed. 2. Let your mind float out into the future. 3. When you are there now, at that future time, in your imagination, think back to the past, which is the future now, and remember what has happened. This is especially useful when thinking about goals and problems, because you can remember how you attained what you wanted, which is easier than trying to look into the future. When you have learned how you attained your goal or solved your problem, then you can return to the past now. In present time you might like to make notes about what you have discovered."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Page - 63 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Time Travelling into the Future To Eliminate Anxiety Take a journey in time into the future and solve your anxieties. Use this to deal with something that you are concerned about in the future, for example, having a difficult conversation, attending an important meeting or sales demonstration. 1. Relax and be quiet, closing your eyes, if you like. 2. Image yourself floating in space above your personal history line and move over it into the future to a time when the issue you are concerned about has already occurred. 3. Be ahead of this time on your personal history line. Ask yourself, 'Do I feel anxious about this?' Of course the answer is no, because that incident is in the past, finished and done. How's that? Better? Mm! You did well! 4. Float back to the present and bring with you that feeling that you are no longer concerned. When we are worried about something in the future, we forget all the times in the past when we have been concerned, but afterwards, we forgot all about it. The things we were worried about then in the future were sooner or later in the past. Even if we are anxious about going to the dentist, after we have been we are no longer concerned. So, why wait?

Relax and be quiet, closing your eyes, if you like. 2. Image yourself floating in space above your personal history line and move over it into the past to a time before the event you are concerned occurred. 3. Be before this time on your personal history line. Ask yourself, 'Do I feel concerned about this?' Of course the answer is no, because it is in the future, and hasn't happened yet, so how could you be concerned about it. If you did feel concerned, then you wouldn't be in the right place on your personal history line. Move to that time before in your personal history. 4. Float back to the present and bring with you that feeling that you are no longer concerned. When we regret something in the past, we did not regret it before it happened. We had no thoughts or feelings about it then.

Have you ever noticed someone doing what seems a pretty easy task, and thought that's nothing - until you get to do the job? What about a potato sorter? Easy job. How do you get on when you sit there with the task of grading them A, B or C? Not easy now, is it. You've got to learn what these grading terms mean. You start off very slowly and the person sitting next to you is throwing the potatoes into the correct heaps and chatting away while you are figuring out which goes where. The other starts to berate you for being so slow! Nightmare! At first we have no awareness that we cannot do a task. We think, if we think anything, that it is easy. We are at a stage of unconscious incompetence. We are incompetent, and what is worse, we don't know it. Can you remember before you started to drive? You thought it would be easy didn't you. After a while we realise we do not know how to do a task. We have made progress. We have reached the stage of conscious inability. We can't do it, but now we know we can't. What's better someone who knows they can't fly the plane, or someone who doesn't know they can't and tries anyway? The next step is to learn how to do the task. When you do this, you can do it, but only when you keep your mind on it. Get distracted and it goes to pieces. You've progressed to conscious ability. As long as you've got it in mind you can do it. With repetition, the task becomes automatic and you reach the stage of unconscious ability. You can do it without thinking. You can sort the potatoes and talk about the game. You can drive the car and not even know you have passed through several towns. There is a stage above this. We'll call it unconscious ability with awareness. You can do the task and think, plan and steer the activity without your thinking distracting you from doing it automatically. For example, you can be part of an important conversation, do the right things and be able to think about what is happening and where the conversation is going without being distracted from applying your communication skills, with ability but without thought. 1. Unconscious Inability 2. Conscious Inability 3. Conscious Ability 4. Unconscious Ability 5. Unconscious Ability with Awareness 1. Unconscious Inability When we have never done a task we are unaware of our inability to do a task. A person who has never driven a car, might think it is easy. 2. Conscious Inability When they first try to drive a car, they realize how hard it seems. They have to look where they are going and change gears, etc, and wonder where the break is. The first step is to realize that you have something to learn, and this is the stage of conscious inability."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Page - 66 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved 3. Conscious Ability When we have practised a task a lot, we find that we can do it provided we keep our mind on it and are not distracted. A new driver finds it hard to have a conversation, or to look at the countryside when they are driving. They can do it, but only when they keep their mind on it. 4. Unconscious Ability After a lot of practice, we can do things without thinking about them. We can do them automatically and do other tasks at the same time. The driver can now take in complicated events on the road, while having a conversation with another person. 5. Unconscious Ability with Awareness It is very strange, very strange indeed. That when we have learned to do some things automatically, we find it hard to do them when we try to do them wile thinking what we are doing. A centipede was happy quite, until a toad in fun Said, \"Pray which leg comes after which?\" This raised his doubts to such a pitch He fell distracted in the ditch Not knowing how to run. However, the ability to do things while we reflect upon them is one of the highest skills we can achieve. When we first learn to build rapport, we are wholly thinking about mirroring the other person. This is conscious ability. We can do it if we keep our mind on it. However, when we wonder how we are doing we forget to mirror! When our mind moves to something else we stop mirroring. Later we can mirror automatically without thought. We do not have to think of it consciously. We have attained unconscious ability. As we develop further, we learn to do whole tasks automatically so we are free to think about the whole picture, and still perform our tasks without thinking about them. This is the stage of unconscious ability with awareness. How do we do this? We do this by over-learning the tasks. We practise, even after we have learned the task, so we do it automatically. Learning and Performance There is a difference between learning and performance. We can learn without showing an improvement in performance. This is especially clear when we consider how people learn to type. Here, the difference becomes apparent. When we learn to type, we type a letter at a time. The more we practise, the more we improve, until we reach a plateau and don't seem to make progress. Then all of a sudden, off we go again. We are improving our typing speed, after a time when we"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" Page - 67 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved didn’t seem to improve at all. What has happened is we are typing whole words automatically and our speed increases. After learning to type single letters automatically, we then learn how to type whole words automatically. While we are doing this, our performance may actually get worse. Students get upset and think they are getting nowhere. But they are learning all the time although their performance is not showing the learning. While our progress was slow during this stage, we were still learning. We were learning how to type whole words at once. Our performance did not increase – we didn’t get faster. Our performance did not change, but we were learning. And when we had learned how to type whole words, our performance dramatically improved and we got much faster. In the previous stage, we were typing letters without thinking where our fingers were. Now we are typing whole words without wondering where our fingers are. Before we typed a single letter automatically, and typed words a letter at a time. Now we type the whole word automatically, without thought. An average golfer who takes instruction from a coach to correct his bad habits, may actually play worse for a while until he integrates his new skills into his behaviour. When you are learning something and you do not seem to be making progress, consider that you may well be learning, even though your increased learning does not show up in your performance. Make sure you learn and apply this valuable information so you are aware of what you need to do in any task, and you realise that sometimes progress seems to slow down when we move through these stages. Are you aware of how easy it is to change when you know how to? "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Page - 68 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Utilisation - using what you have to attain whatever you want! Utilisation is a key technique. It works magic. With utilisation you use whatever is available to attain your goals. Utilisation is the stuff of genius! When we think and feel that we can't do something, this is something we are doing – not a negative. Think about it! You are doing an act of forgetting rather than doing an act of remembering. You are doing something rather than not doing something. You are showing ability and not inability. You are actually doing an ability. For example, if you forget something, you have actually done something. You have forgotten and you have succeeded in forgetting. There are many people in the world who want this skill. This skill of forgetting is extremely valuable to those with traumatic memories, people who worry, and people with phobias. Have you ever heard of someone with a phobia who forgot to be afraid? No. Neither have I. Such people have this wonderful skill of never forgetting. They would like to utilize the skill of forgetting, but don’t know how. Have you ever heard of anyone with a fear of spiders, who instead of panicking, said they couldn’t be bothered to panick. They felt so unmotivated. No. Neither have I. They are always motivated and always panick, until they learn to be unmotivated. For instance, you want to be self confident in a given situation but you can't do it. You can lack confidence. You can do that, but you can't have confidence. Let's utilise this. You have the ability to lack self-confidence, and you have the ability to have self-confidence. That is you can think, do and feel non-self-confident things. You are actually doing this. 1. You are thinking, feeling and doing non-self-confident things. 2. You are thinking non-self-confident thoughts 3. You are seeing in your mind non-self-confident pictures. 4. You are standing or moving in a non-self-confident way. 5. You are feeling non-self-confident. Aren’t you? You are not merely lacking self confidence, you possessing the skills of lacking confidence. Be sure to understand that we are not here talking about negatives but"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" Page - 69 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved actual things that are said and done. For example, you might think, 'I want to give my opinion', then feel anxious, and think 'I'll just make a fool of myself.' You are doing things! You are succeeding in making yourself lack confidence. Utilisation requires us to recognise that we have skills and abilities to not-do what we'd like. It doesn't merely concentrate on what we wish we could do. We recognise and acknowledge what we can do, even if it doesn't lead to our goal! Now, utilising what we have, what would it be like if you used your ability 'not to be self-confident' to lack the ability to be not-self-confident? Now this isn't merely words. You can think of the situation and think 'I can't be self-confident.' Supposing you use these real feeling and thoughts and apply them to your 'lack of self-confidence' and you think about yourself lacking self confidence and think, 'I can't do that!' If you couldn't lack self-confidence, you would be self-confident wouldn't you? Now I know this may be hard to understand, so let’s try again. Imagine that someone, let’s call him Jack, runs in a race and after a few steps crashes to the floor gasping for breath. And we say to another person, say Mary who is a super-fit person, you can be like Jack if you stop doing exercise and eat bad food. She might say to us, “I couldn’t do that! I’d show myself up and look such a wimp!” Did you hear what she said? She said, “I couldn’t do that!”. Mary is using an ability to keep fit and to keep motivated. If we told Jack that if he did exercise and ate the right food, he could be as fit as Mary, he might say, “I couldn’t do that. I like my food too much. And I hate exercise.” However, Jack can eat bad food and not do exercise, and this is how he can be unfit. Mary, on the other hand, cannot do that, and this is how she keeps fit. Did you notice that they both have the same skills, but they use them differently and get different results? Note: In everything you do, you are using skills and abilities. The actual results of the skills might not be what you want, although the skills themselves are always useful. Using your skills in one way, produces one set of results, and using them in Error! No index entries found. produces another set of results. How can you use these skills to get what you want? For example, suppose you prevent yourself from being relaxed in a situation by feeling anxious. You can feel anxious. You can create anxious feelings. In this case you are creating anxiety, but the same skill can be used to create any ability. You may also have the skill that you can't feel relaxed.

Utilise the skills and abilities that you have. For example, thinking I can't help being relaxed. Imagine yourself in that situation, thinking I can’t help being relaxed. Do this in the same way you thought you couldn’t help being anxious. Can you see yourself thinking and feeling I can’t help being relaxed and as much as you try, you just can't help being relaxed.

We all have descriptions of people and perhaps of ourselves. These words have been used throughout history. Although in this century we have developed and used a number of scientific words to describe people, the simple descriptions sometimes bring about greater understanding. One way of understanding other people is to use the following list and identify the different types of people in your life. Understand that people are too complicated to fully describe using a label, even though using labels takes us some way to understanding them. So in your understanding of people, use labels wisely! You may notice that some people can be described with more than one label. Achiever Has high hopes and works hard to achieve goals. Affiliator Likes people and associating with people. Likes good relationships Fighter Is already ready for an argument or a conflict. Loves it! Independent Judges things by their own standards and will go for what they want alone. Perseverer Just can't stop when they get their teeth into something. Here is someone who likes to complete things. Exhibitionist This person likes to be the centre of attention and will do anything to be before the eyes of others. Fearful This person shrinks from excitement and anything that might be a threat Impulsive The Mr Toad character who thinks of something (or rather doesn't think enough about it) and does it. Carer This person wants to help people and is concerned about them. Orderer Hates disorder and untidiness. Spends ages making things tidy or orderly. Can be a nitpicker! Boss Likes power.

Of course, this doesn't pretend to be a complete list. You can figure out other types from the above. For example, the opposite of 'Impulsive' is 'Cautious.'

"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" Page - 73 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved The Qualities of Effective People Effective people: 1. Believe there is no such thing as perfection. 2. Believe the basic intention of life, the universe, people, etc, is relatively good Everyone always believe that they are right and that are doing good, from their own perspective. 3. Seek only obtaining a result, a decision, a change, not to win or lose. 4. Believe there is no failure or success, only feedback, knowledge. 5. Act with integrity and honesty. 6. Do something else, or stop doing nothing, if things are not to their preference. 7. View ideas and thoughts from various viewpoints. 8. Have a clear idea of objectives. 9. Believe mind and Body are part of the same system. 1. Believe there is no such thing as perfection Actually this is a self-evident truth. There is nothing in the world that is perfect. Those who believe in perfection cause misery for themselves and others. They believe that there is nothing else for them to do because things are perfect already. Alternatively, people who believe in perfection believe that nothing is good enough and is never ready, because it is not perfect. Effective people know there is always something else that can be done to improve things, and for this reason they will never actually make something perfect, so the solution is acceptable when it is optimum. There are optimum solutions, not perfect ones. When we believe in perfection, we tend to use words like 'must' and 'should.' For example, 'People ought to do that.' When we say this, we mean 'People don't do this', and 'I want them to do it', and 'I am not going to do anything to get them to do it, except moan!' In this case, being unrealistic is counter productive. 2. Believe the basic intention of life, the universe, people, etc, is relatively good People always believe that they are right and are doing good, from their own perspective. Even the most evil person from our perspective believes he or she is doing right. Otherwise, they wouldn't be doing what they are doing! No one holds a false belief - no one says, 'I believe this', and add, 'but I know it is false.' Everyone always believes they are right. Even a person, who says they are evil, believes this is right and good. However, if we believe that people are evil, we may become frightened of them and react to them unpleasantly, and they will behave worse to us. So effective people believe that people are basically good. However, effective people do not believe that people are absolutely good. If we believe that people or things are absolutely good, then we treat them as Gods or angels and, clearly we do not react to them as they really are because no one is a god or an angel. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Page - 74 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved When we believe that things are basically good, then we begin to understand them better. If we think someone is evil, we will imagine that we cannot influence him or her or we will try to influence from our belief-value that they are bad. This will never be effective, because they believe they are good, and doing what is right, so they will never relate to our belief that they are bad. They will simply believe that we are bad! By believing they do, even bad things, from a good intention we can better understand them and begin to influence them, because we take the trouble to understand them and how they think, rather than to fight them head on in terms of the values of good and bad. This is a key concept. We should set our seeds according to the soil! 3. Seek only obtaining a result, a decision, or a change, not to win or lose. When we seek to win, we become anxious about the result. We may procrastinate and do nothing to win because we might lose. The effective person, because they can happily win or lose, and because they seek a result, they do not fear asking for what they want or doing what they think will lead to their goal. This does not mean that the effective person doesn't want to win, or sometimes lose. It means they know they are losing already when they are not getting a decision from the other person, or not taking action themselves. Losing is the normal state. Therefore, it cannot be good or bad, it's only the place where we all start in any venture. So by taking action or non-action or getting action (or non-action) from another you have nothing to lose, and can only gain, if not on this occasion, then in the future. For example, if you want a better life, you are not completely satisfied with your life (Otherwise you wouldn't to change it by making it better!). When you ask, you might get a 'No', but if you do not ask, then nothing will change. Getting a “No”, therefore, isn't a loss. You at least get some information. And taking action, for example by asking, is one way you can succeed. “Ask and ye shall receive”. Here we have an irony, that by seeking to win, we increase our likelihood of losing. 4. Believe there is no failure or success, only feedback, knowledge This belief links to the previous one. The Effective person does not fear failure, because he or she does not believe in failure or success. They obtain feedback. This does not mean that the Effective Person doesn't want to succeed. It means that they will succeed because they seek feedback. This leads to the next belief. 5. Act with integrity and honesty. One of the great secrets of a successful and happy life is to act with integrity and honesty. When we were little children we were told we should be honest, and we were told this meant telling the truth. We were given this simple meaning because we were too young and inexperienced to fully understand the success technique of honesty and integrity. Of course, telling the truth got us into a lot of trouble. Even adults will say, \"Well, I was telling the truth. It was right.\""},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Page - 75 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Of course, telling the truth is important and is a big part of integrity and honesty. But it clearly means more than this, and telling the truth is not an essential part. Moral qualities, that is, ways of living our life successfully, are good. Yet sometimes telling the truth is bad, as when this causes great upset in the other person for no good reason. “White lies” and keeping quiet are sometimes better than telling the truth. This is not acting with honesty and integrity! Although it is better to speak truthfully, it is not always better to speak about some things! Some people are verbally incontinent and will tell you everything, even personal things, and this is not behaving with integrity and honesty. Although no one can properly define these concepts, we all know what they mean. By putting aside our childish definitions, we can understand and live these concepts and reap all the benefits. 6. Do something else, or stop doing nothing, if things are not to their preference. When the feedback or knowledge that the Effective Person gains does not solve their problem, they do something else. They do something, if they are doing nothing, or they change what they were doing, or even do nothing. They know, If you always do what you have always done, then you will always get what you always got. And they know that to believe anything else is crazy! They do not believe things will turn out right. They know that if things are not to their liking, they must do something different to get a different result. If you are dissatisfied with parts of your life, then, if you want to change, then you must do things differently. If you do nothing, or merely hope, then things will stay just as they are (or get worse). This is a hard truth, isn’t it? 7. View ideas and thoughts from various viewpoints. We all know that we are supposed to view things from the other's point of view as well as our own. But how many of us do it? As children we are limited to our own viewpoint and we cannot see the viewpoints of others. And when we grow up, we often do not realise that we have progressed far enough to think about things from various viewpoints. We can understand things and other people from our own viewpoint. We can understand things and other people through how we understand their viewpoints. We can understand things and other people through how they understand them. If we learn this skill, our ability to influence others and to avoid upsets will have increased manifold."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" Page - 76 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved 8. Have a clear idea of objectives The Effective People think out what they want. They have a clear idea of what they want to achieve. They do not seek to gain what they want in one fell swoop. They know they will get feedback, and they act or not act to produce an intended result. They repeat these actions until they attain their goal or objective. If they didn't know where they were going, they'd usually end up somewhere else! And not attain their goals. 9. Believe mind and Body are part of the same system This might sound metaphysical, but many people, if not all of us, are to some degree not closely in touch with our bodies and our minds. To feel better mentally, we might look to improving the body. When improving the body, we might take care to care for our minds. Over indulgence in one or the other will not help either. We assume that there is a correspondence between what we call mind and what we call body. So when there are certain things occurring in the mind, there are corresponding events occurring in the body; and when there are certain events occurring in the body there are corresponding ones occurring in the mind. We need to clarify the above. It is not only a scientific statement. It is not saying only that when we think there are certain physical-chemical events occurring in the brain at the same time. It is also a personal development statement. So when we are worried about something, it is not just that we are having certain thoughts, but that we are having certain feelings in the body, which we can experience. For example, if we are concerned about what we should do about something we have certain thoughts that we may or may not be able to articulate, and we have certain feelings in our bodies, which we may or may not be aware of at the time. Put simply, successful personal development occurs when both bodily and mental experiences are dealt with. The mind and the body are not completely different. They are different aspects of the same thing."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Page - 77 Mind Changing Techniques to Keep the Change By Ken Ward Copyright ©2002 Ken J Ward All Rights Reserved Next Steps The following links may help you in your self development.
