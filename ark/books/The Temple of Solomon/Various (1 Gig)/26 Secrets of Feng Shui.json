If you can arrange your front door so that it faces your overall harmonyor great prosperity direction, it will help bring in wealth, love and happiness. Asall energy enters through your front door, it is important to keep things away fromthe door so the door will be free to open without problems. Make sure your front door is not broken, and opens smoothly.Abroken door orone that is hard to enter is the worst kind of energy to start with. Your door sizeshould not be too large or too small relative to the size of the house. If the westernworld had practiced feng shui from the beginning, we could have avoided much ofthe trouble we have today in our personal lives as well as in our work or business. I have seen many front doors of homes face asolid wall immediately upon entering. Themain door should not open inside onto a solidwall within three feet of the open door.Theonly thing you can do is to place a mirrorhere so that upon entering, the space lookslarger.This is not an ideal solution, as it is notgood to have a mirror reflecting the frontdoor, but it is better to have a mirror here ifthe space is too tight for comfort. The subject of Feng Shui is actually far more profound than the popular belief that it is a kindof mystic interior design.It is the art and science of living and working in the right environment.Feng Shui is concerned with the flow and circulation of vital energy called \"Chi\" and is the interplay ofthe Yin and Yang within the five elements. Feng Shui is the intertwining between people,places and theinteractions of energies. The universe is a vast field of energy. Feng Shui is the study of this energy andhow it moves through the universe and affects us directly and indirectly.Modern science of Electro-physics is beginning to realize the interaction of electromagnetic energies between the earth andhumans. These electromagnetic energies are the Chi lines running through the veins of the earth,thus cre-ating energy for the earth and the people who live upon it.15"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The size of the door should be well balanced to the dwelling, not too small or over-sized in proportion to the rest of the house. Too narrow an entrance stifles the flowof good ch’i entering the house, and you will have to invest more time, money andenergy to achieve your goals if you live in a house with a small entrance. Well-situated front doors are wide and leadinto a foyer that open to other rooms in thehouse. The foyer acts as a buffer to slowthe fast flowing energy as it enters yourhome. The front door should neveropen directly into the living roomwithout some kind of buffer to slowthe energy. If you have no choice putan attractive three-fold screen a fewfeet from the entrance with a healthygreen plant in front of the screen. Thescreen slows the good ch’i energy so that itcan flow softly around the screen. The first things you or visitors see when entering your home set the mood for therest of the stay. Clutter should not be allowed to accumulate anywhere, but theentrance is a particularly bad place for untidiness. People have a tendency to putthings at the door as a reminder to get rid of the things with good intentions of tak-ing them away. But have you noticed even with yourself you leave it there,because you are in a hurry and will do that later. Later, turns into days later.Thisis bad for the subconscious mind. It is there when you arrive back home and dueto the rush it continues to stay there. If you want good feng shui in the home tak-ing this stuff away should be first on your priority list When you look out of your front door, you should not face a hill, and the dooritself should not be hidden by shrubbery. It is not a good situation if there areobstructions in front of the door, such as a steep hill, another larger building, orany kind of over-sized or massive structure. The entrance should be well lit and airy.The best shape for a door is oval or squareat the top. Solid wood doors are better than glass doors.

In Feng Shui, people as well as homes are divided into EASTand WESTgroups.You can determine if your house is good for you once you establish whether youare an East or West group person. If you live in the type of house appropriate forthe opposite group, you may never become wealthy in that house. However, youcan arrange the furniture to improve your living conditions.

The chimes should be hollow and large enough so they pro-duce a nice melody of pleasing sounds when chimed. Together with harmony andrhythm, melody is one of the three basic elements of music. Having soothingsounds in your environment is another way to attract harmony and money.Speaking of sound, soft music in the home is important to elevate one’s energy,making it easier to produce good work that generates more money.The front door entrance should never lead in a straight line to a back door or largewindow.All of your luck and finances will flow through the house and out theback door or window.This is the worst kind of energy of all for losing your hardearned money.

Apartment and condominium liv-ing provide different challenges.

Herbusiness improved tremendously.Place green plants around the room, but balance them with other things. Your fur-niture should be spacious, uncluttered and pleasing to the eye. Paintings should bewarm and inviting. Never have cactus in your home. Cactus is the worst kind ofplant you can have in your home. They are very unlucky.Try to keep a nice bou-quet of fresh flowers near the entrance to the house. People feel immediately atease when they see fresh flowers. This is the reason you always see fresh flowersin restaurants or in the lobbies of hotels. Your living room should be fresh and have a feeling of being lived in. So manyfamilies have family rooms they use instead of their living rooms, saving the liv-ing room for special occasions. Rooms in your home that are unused accumulatestagnant energy and detract from an otherwise balanced home.Live in this room! That’s how it got its name!

There isn’t just one elementto consider when planning your life with abundance; you need to take everythinginto account, including the way you revitalize yourself. Your bed should be comfortable, and the energy should flow smoothly throughoutthe room. You should not have anything under the bed, so that energy can circu-late properly.The bedroom should be painted a soft color that suits your energy so you will restpeacefully.Abedroom should never be painted red. Red is an energizing color andyou will not get the proper rest if you sleep in a red room. Fresh air should alwaysbe circulating through your bedroom and also through the rest of the house. If you live in an apartment building as I do, and do not have much circulation flow-ing throughout, get a small floor Vornado fan and place it near a window. I rec-ommend the Vornado fan because it is the only one Ihave found that is quiet and doesn’t blow toohard. It is the quietest fan I have found on themarket. Most fans, even on the lowestspeed, tend to move too fast. Ceiling fansturned low are also a good way to circu-late energy. Ceiling fans should not beplaced directly over your bed.Your bedroom should never have a mir-ror that faces the bed, as it interferes withrestful sleep. Mirrors should not beplaced behind your bed, at your feet or by theside of the bed.

It thenrushes back inside the body with the result that you never get a good night’s sleep. 310"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Chinese also believe that a white coverlet is unhealthy because it is the colorof the shroud that covers the dead.

If you have a square table,try to get one with rounded corners. The dining room should be well lit, with pictures placed on the wall that are relax-ing to look at and soothing to the nerves.

The placement of the stove in the kitchen can bringextreme good luck to the owners, ensuring wealth and abundance. The stove canalso ensure for the owners, a place of high position in the business world.If you are not having enough luck in your life, one of the first things to take a lookat is your stove and its placement.

Europeans and Asians have no problemwith keeping their bathroom doors closed. Whether in your home, office or busi-ness, this is one of the most important elements for having and keeping wealth. The Chinese say you flush yourwealth away if you do not keep thebathroom door closed and the toiletlid down. The Bathroom is a waterelement, so blue and green colors aregood to be placed there. The bath-room should never have red in it asthe fire energy conflicts with thewater element.The bathroom should never be placedin the wealth section of the home (the Southeast section). I once conducted a fengshui for a lady in Southern California. When her husband remodeled their house,he added an extra bathroom in the wealth section. Shortly after remodeling, hewent bankrupt. She told me he died a short time later from the trauma because hecould not handle being in that position. It is very important to keep thebathroom door closed at all times,but especially if you have a bath-room that adjoins your bedroom.If there is no door, only anentrance, hide the doorway with acurtain or screen. Alot of modernhomes are made with no bathroomdoors..6You can counterbalance the negative force byplacing the opposite color,if the bathroom isplaced in an unfortunate place in the house.• Washers in leaky faucets should be replaced immediately,f o rleaky faucets slowly leak away your finances.• The proper placement of the bathroom in the home is also animportant element for accumulating and keeping wealth.• The head of your bed should not be placed on a bathroomwall as this placement is detrimental to your health.15"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Watch Your Back While at WorkWhether you work at home or in an office, never sit with your back to the door,and try not to face a wall. Facing a wall can make it seem as thoughyou will never get ahead, as your progressis blocked. If you do face a wall, and it isimpossible to rearrange your desk, a mirrorplaced on the wall in front of you will helpto some extent remedy the situation. Many offices today have cubicles wherepeople are all crowded together. If this isthe case and you must sit with your “back tothe door,” a small mirror on the wall in frontof you will allow you to see peopleapproaching from behind. You’ll find this small adjustment will increase yourcomfort level. It isn’t conducive to good ch’i energy to work with your back to thedoor or to other people. If your back is to the door or to other people, you areopening yourself up to get stabbed in the back. Your back should not face a window, either, as you will not have the support youneed. If this is not possible, keep the window covered with drapes or blinds, andplace a large green plant by the window or in front of it. You can also use a screenfor the same purpose.Never sit directly in front of your office door.Try to sit at an angle so that you havea good view of the door, but are not directly in front of it. If you work in a home or outside office, always try to sit facing your great pros-perity direction. If that is not possible, sit facing one of your three other gooddirections, preferably your overall harmony direction.

When the bed where you sleep, or where you sit at work have exposed beams over-head, they can cause ill health, bad luck and business problems. Sleeping under anexposed beam can cause severe illness.If your desk is directly under an exposed beam, you will have a difficult timeachieving your full potential in the business world. Ceilings were never meant tohave exposed beams. The best ceiling should have a flat surface and if at all pos-sible, have rounded edges at the corners. Standing beams protruding from cor-ners can cause problems in any sectionwhere they happen to be. For instance,beams in the marriage corner can fos-ter conflict and divorce, in the wealthcorner they cause the loss of money,and in the knowledge corner, lack ofeducation for you or your children. If you have such large beams (squarecolumns) placed in corners, you can camouflage the edges by putting plants infront of them. You can cover the sides of the beam with mirrors (except in the bed-room), and flowers will also help the flow of energy.Hollow wind chimes can also be placed from the ceiling close to the beam, andthis will help the flow of energy to pass by the beam. They are not as effective asthe plants or mirrors, but if you cannot do anything else, you can use chimes. 817"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Replace or Repair Broken Items & Don’t OvercrowdEverything in your home should be in working order.

Cleaning out clutter and keeping your home and office neat and tidy is one of thefirst steps toward “activating” your sectors ruling health, wealth and romance.After cleaning out the clutter physically, clean and straighten up the place, vacu-um, sweep and mop all areas of the house. This should be done at least once aweek. Allocate different corners to each individual in your household inorder to maximize and enhance your wealth section. If you findthat you do not use something within a year, get rid of it.

This isa very important course of action for clearing away negativeenergies. I clear negative energies with each feng shui I do. Itgets rid of dead energy and brings new life into the home. At first, some people are concerned and feel a little apprehen-sive with this procedure because the procedure isn’t something they’re familiarwith. Smudge clearing raises the level of vibrations in a place. I tell the people itis not, “good” or “bad” energy, it is just static energy that needs to be dispersed tomake way for clearer and more active energy.

The childrenlove it and any pets like to be around when it is going on. Animals can see the ener-gy changing and are very interested in watching it move. The amount of time ittakes to clear and smudge depends on the size of the house. Speaking about the size of the home reminds me of a friend who said I should mention,thatit isn’t the size of a home that makes for good feng shui.You can live in one room and stillhave wonderful feng shui,and live in a mansion where it is not nearly as good.But the sizeof the home takes a certain amount of time to clear the energy.After I help the people clearout and rearrange furniture,I sometimes spend as much as two hours smudging and clear-ing with bells or gongs.When you feng shui it takes time to tune to the space.I recommenddoing some deep breathing exercises as it helps to tune into the space.When you are doingthis procedure,it is important for you to feel this connection with your space. You must berelaxed in order to accomplish this.Start at the front door and go around the perimeter of the house feeling and sens-ing the energy. Once you do this, you will be amazed to discover how you can feelstagnant or alive energy in different rooms. Since your home is already familiar toyou, it will be easier to tune in if you sit quietly in each room and try to feel theenergy. If you have an affinity with animals or plants, you will find that you havean affinity with buildings, too. Buildings have energy just as animals or plants,you just have to tune into this energy to help release suppressed energy and moveit so it becomes alive again.If your home is more than one floor, start at the bottom of the building and moveupward to each level. Energy always stagnates at the bottom. If you have a base-ment, start working with the basement first. Most people have cluttered base-ments, and if this is the case, get in there and clean it out You will be amazed tosee what a difference you’ll feel and how your life will change.

The chart in the back of thebook shows you clearly which category Kua numbers you belong in. 49"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"This chart contains your Kua number.
