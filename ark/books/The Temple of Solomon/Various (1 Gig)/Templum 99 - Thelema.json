Act upon “Love is the Law, love under will”8. Act upon the other instructions in Liber Al (“a feast for every day...” etc.)9. Practice the Magical System of Thelema as in ‘Magick in Theory and Practice’10. If minded, align yourself with others of a Thelemic lifestyleNotesCrowley did not invent Thelema, but he certainly promulgated its philosophy and wrapped the existingmagical systems around its heart. The Book of the Law is worthy of study by all those enquiring aboutthe Universe, as it synthesises all of Crowley’s teachings, despite the inherent problems caused by itbeing a “transmitted” document. It is important not to miss the other Holy Books written by Crowley,which are often sublime mystical tracts of the greatest value and beauty. Don’t believe the publicityabout Crowley – discover him for yourself. Magick without Tears is extremely useful and clearlywritten, but more useful once you’ve already started the practice of a Thelemic Attitude. Crowleywould have wound Psychosyhnthesis into his work if it had been developed earlier, so that’s worth alook as a psychological take into the uncovering of Will. The main problem with studying Crowley isthat it is hard work – you will need to ensure you have a background in many other schools of thoughtto get a full comprehension of his body of work.In Real Life ...There are a number of OTO’s, the organisation that promotes Crowley’s philosophy. You don’t have tojoin any of them to be a Thelemite, but they can function as useful contact agencies to make links withother Thelemites. Don’t expect to see eye-to-eye with anyone else, though! By it’s very nature,Thelema encourages the individual to approach their life on their own grounds, so many Thelemites arepositively individualistic – with all that that implies! The weirdest Thelemic-related event I have hadinvolved my wife and I being hounded around a domestic supermarket by a wild-eyed Thelemite weknew warning us of the dire consequences of revealing to others the secret conspiracy he wasbroadcasting to all and sundry across the supermarket! Needless to say, the politics of Thelema oftendetract from those working with it.Links• http://www.crl.com/~thelema/home.htmlBooks• The Book of the Law (Crowley)• Gargantua and Pantagruel (Rabelais)• Magick in Theory and Practice (Crowley)http://www.templum.comCognitatione sui secumque colloquio firmitatem petere.A Site for Enquiring Minds."}]
