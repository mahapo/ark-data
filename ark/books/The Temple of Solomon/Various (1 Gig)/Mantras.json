[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" - - 1 A Course In Astral Travel WEEK 4 Mantras for Astral projection _____________________________________________________________________ Copyright 2001 By Mark Pritchard Mantras for Astral projection For this session we are going to study another technique for Astral projection, as concentration and visualisation is not the only way to Astral project, it is also possible to project using mantras, although you will still need to concentrate upon the Mantra. Mantras are constantly repeated sounds, words or phrases. They can be used for a variety of purposes such as increasing intuition or for remembering dreams, etc. For this topic I will mention mantras that are effective for Astral projection. Three of the ones used here, have an elongated pronunciation of vowels. Pronouncing the vowels like this stimulates the different Chakras in the Astral body. Chakras are senses of the Astral body, there are seven of them and each, when stimulated, give their own different psychic effects. In this case, they help the detachment of the connections that exist between the physical and Astral bodies. It’s worth remembering though that this pronouncing of mantras stimulates the Chakras and helps the projection just for the time that you do it, if you don’t pronounce the mantras you are not going to get their benefits. However, when you do the spiritual work you can activate the Chakras and their corresponding faculties fully and permanently. Pronouncing the Mantras So for Astral projection we are going to use the following mantras and I am going to explain how to pronounce each of them. Have a listen to the sound files if you have access to them so that you will be able to hear the mantras pronounced and will be able to pronounce them properly: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" - - 2La Ra S - pronounced, Laaaaaaaaaaa Rrraaaaaaaaaaa Ssssssssssssssss. La - The vowel ‘a’ is pronounced as the ‘a’ in the word ‘tap’. Ra - The ‘r’ is trilled. The ‘a’ is pronounced as the ‘a’ in the word far. S - The ‘s’ is pronounced as the ‘s’ in snake, like a hiss. Breathe in through the nose; breathe out slowly through the mouth pronouncing the syllable. You use one breath for each of the words, for example, (breath) Laaaaaaaaaaa, (breath) Rrraaaaaaaaaaa, (breath) Ssssssssssssssss. Egypto - pronounced, Eeeeeeeeeeee hiiiiiiiiiiiiiip tooooooooooo. E - The vowel ‘e’ is pronounced as the ‘e’ in the word let. Hip - The vowel ‘i’ is pronounced as the ‘ea’ in the word tea, or the ‘ee’ in the word sheep. To - The vowel ‘o’ is pronounced as the ‘o’ in the word more. Breathe in through the nose; breathe out slowly through the mouth pronouncing the syllable. You use one breath for each of the syllables, for example, (breath) Eeeeeeeeeeeeee, (breath) Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiip, (breath) Tooooooooooooo. Fa Ra On - pronounced Faaaaaaaaaaaa Rrraaaaaaaaaaa Oooooooooonnnn. Fa - The vowel ‘a’ is pronounced as the ‘a’ in the word ‘far’. Ra - The ‘r’ is trilled. On - The vowel ‘o’ is pronounced as the ‘o’ in the word more. Breathe in through the nose; breathe out slowly through the mouth pronouncing the syllable. You use one breath for each of the syllables, for example, (breath) Faaaaaaaaaaaa, (breath) Rrraaaaaaaaaaa, (breath) Oooooooooonnnn. You can practice a variation of this Mantra by visualising the Egyptian pyramids while you do it. One example of this Mantra working is a student of this course who pronounced this Mantra and woke up in the Astral inside one of the pyramids. Tae re re re re re – This mantra is different to the three previous ones. Tae - pronounced as in the word ‘Thai’ (the inhabitants of Thailand). Re - pronounced as in the word ‘rep’ (short for ‘representative’, as in ‘sales rep’). It is pronounced quickly, without elongating the vowels. Tae is pronounced once, and then you pronounce the other five syllables one after the other very quickly. This is all done in one breath and you continue repeating the whole mantra with each breath. Pronounce these mantras until you Astral project or fall asleep. When you’re pronouncing these mantras you still need to concentrate on them, they will be far less effective if you don’t. There are other mantras that can be used for Astral projection; you will come across those later, if you continue with the courses. These will be enough to be going on with for a while. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" - - 3Projecting With The Mantras It’s best to develop a certain Mantra (such as La Ra Ssss for example) and try it for a few days in a row or longer, so that you allow the chakras to activate more with the particular Mantra, because some activate different chakras than others. Bear in mind that you can practice the Astral at any time of the day; the morning can be a particularly good time. When you choose a mantra stick with it for the duration of the exercise, don’t change to another mantra or to a different type of exercise. Concentration upon pronouncing the Mantras is important because if you don’t have it you could lose track of the syllables you are pronouncing because they are interrupted by thoughts. Then you can forget where you are in the Mantra and the continuity of it will be broken and disrupted and the exercise will be weakened. When you do these mantras you need to be lying down ready to sleep, as you would when practising concentration for Astral projection. Relax the body, then pronounce the mantra aloud for a short time, then get progressively quieter until you are only pronouncing it in your mind. From then on breathe as normal as you no longer need to take a deep breath to pronounce the Mantra aloud. Then continue pronouncing it over and over in your mind until sleep arrives. If you cannot pronounce it aloud in the beginning for any reason, pronounce it mentally from the beginning. The process of going into the Astral with mantras is the same as with concentration, with the electric like current and so on. However, parts of the Astral body may more noticeably begin to detach from the physical body, for example, an arm or a leg may lift up, or a hand or fingers may move, or your face may be in a different direction to the one you are lying in. When anything like this happens, you may not realise that the body has detached, I have known a student who was doing this exercise and was spinning around, he was wondering what was happening, but he didn’t realise, or the thought never occurred to him that he was actually in the Astral. On the other hand, I have known of a student who realised about this when pronouncing mantras and Astral projected ten times in one night, repeating the mantra each time and getting up whenever a body part moved. So if any of these things happen, or you have begun to float, and you think you might have projected, slowly get up from the bed (you need to do it gently or you can wake yourself up) or roll over out of bed gently and check whether you are in the Astral in the ways that I have mentioned in previous topics, if you are in the physical, go back to bed and try again, once the signs appear again, get up, if you keep doing this; you will eventually get up in the Astral. However, you may also lift out of the body or wake up already in the Astral from pronouncing these mantras. You need to train yourself to get up from bed when the parts of your body begin to move. Don’t pretend or imagine that you are getting up; you have to actually get up from bed. Like everything with Astral projection, a lot of patience is required and for some people it can take a long time. But if you persist you find that it will eventually work."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" - - 4Exercises to do for this week Although this is a technique to project using Mantras, you still need to be able to concentrate upon the Mantra and, to go back to visualisation techniques (as we will soon do in future topics), you will need to have maintained your ability to concentrate upon what you are doing and to visualise, therefore we are going to continue with what is important to maintain and increase these while we use Mantras. These weekly exercises are most important for getting into the Astral, if you do them all methodically each day this week you will have a much better chance of being able to succeed than if you just try a mix of things here and there. 1. To Astral Project a). Mantras – Try two different ones this week starting with La Ra S this will give you the opportunity to develop each one properly and to learn about how each one works, because they are all slightly different and each different sound has a different effect on the chakras, so if you keep to a particular one for long enough you will activate that chakra much more, making the exercise more effective. b). Visualising an object for ten minutes each day – Vary the objects, for example, a glass of water, a plant, flowers, etc and continue with at least ten minutes each day. Remember to close your eyes when you are recreating the object in your mind and to recreate it often. Don’t try to stay there with your eyes open or force yourself to keep staring at the object for a long period of time. Gradually increase the time you spend on this exercise, begin with jut a little. 2. To wake up in dreams a). Questioning where you are - Ask whether you are in the physical world or in the Astral world by using the jump and pulling your finger and by seeing if there is anything strange around you, in the ways that I have described above, remember to genuinely question, looking around you with as much awareness as you can and try it as often as you can. b). Practicing Awareness - Being aware during the day, helping this exercise to work by making sure you try when you do the three things I mentioned last week –remembering to be aware whenever you are washing yourself, putting your shoes on and eating. c). Practicing Awareness and Questioning – Go for a walk for 10 – 15 minutes each day and intensively practice being aware and practicing questioning which dimension you are in by pulling the finger and jumping. 3. To Remember Dreams Lying still when you wake up, going back over the night’s dreams, using the mantra Raom Gaom."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" - - 5♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ Questions And Answers Q. Part of the problem with the Mantra is that I cannot pronounce it out loud - I think I will continue with heart for moment and wait for a few weeks until my wife is working nights for a week to try mantras. In any one night does it matter if I swap around between heart and mantra i.e. go to sleep concentrating on heart - wake up later and try mantra. In my home office I have a comfortable armchair giving support to back and neck - is it possible to project while sitting relaxed in chair and concentrating on heart during day (sometimes will have opportunity to try this - just haven't bothered to date because I thought it wouldn't work) A. It doesn't really matter if you swap around in one night between concentration and a mantra, if you already have concentration, but it will help to develop your concentration and your ability to experience the exercise if you concentrate on one for a while, because then you can learn more about it. You can project from any position as long as you can concentrate on the exercise and can sleep although lying on the back is the position that most people find works best. I tried the exercise in the afternoon by saying the mantra tae re re re re re and I felt really heavy swirling movements and a sense of dizziness. This increased when I visualised my astral legs moving etc. However, I then got up and I was still in the physical - but I still felt the sensations quickly when I tried it again. Am I getting close and is it OK to visualise the body separating, and am I trying to get up too quickly and should I leave it for a longer time? You are getting close, but you shouldn't visualise the parts of the body moving, you just focus on the mantra and they can begin to move by themselves. Visualising the body moving is part of the same problem, it distracts you from focussing on the mantra and can disrupt the exercise. You are trying to get up too quickly, you should leave it for a longer time, until either the body parts begin to move of their own accord, or you begin floating upwards. If there are 3 words in a Mantra, do I sound each word in the same tone? Does it matter whether I do or not? Yes, sound each word in the same tone. It will be evenly repetitive and will then work better. In a previous lesson you said that if you stop practicing the concentration exercise you would lose what you have built up very quickly. If I swap to using Mantras for the next week or so will I loose what I have built up in concentrating on heart – or should I alternate nights, or do they compliment each other?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" - - 6 Its alright because you are still concentrating on the Mantra, but continue with the concentration/visualisation exercises that are a preparation for the Astral, try those at other times during the day and they will help to build up the concentration. I have a lot of periods during day where I am free for 5 – 10 minutes (I can be sitting but not lying down) – is there any simple exercises you can recommend that will help me improve my awareness / ability to astral project? You can do a basic concentration/visualisation exercise that will keep your concentration going for the Astral. Look at an object carefully, then close your eyes and recreate the image in great detail, when you lose it, open your eyes again and repeat the process. Seeing that I share a bed with my wife and she is a light sleeper (don’t think she will be too impressed if I wake her a few times a night getting up to see if I am in Astral) is there any less obtrusive way to check i.e. pull my finger when I am lying in bed? Also will not be able to say Mantra out loud – will this effect my ability to astral project significantly? You can try pulling your finger while you are still in bed to check and wait for sure signs of projecting before you try to get up in the astral. Saying the mantra mentally still works its just a bit more difficult. In regards to the relaxation exercise, I just systematically go through my muscles telling them to relax in my head. Don't tell the muscles to relax in your head, feel each muscle relaxing and experiment with the three ways of relaxing the muscles that I mention in the topics so that you find what suits you best. If doing Mantra exercise during day I assume you should keep your eyes closed – would it be of benefit to wear an “eye cover” to block out light? Will concentration on heart exercise work equally well in daytime? Its best to close your eyes, but there is no need to wear a light block, unless you find the light a problem because if you are concentrating on the Mantra, it won't matter if its daylight. Its the same for concentration on the heart, it will also work in the daytime. You said to visualise pyramids for “Fa Ra On “ I am going to use “La Ra S” (I like the sound of it), is there anything I should visualise for this one to make it more effective? When you say to concentrate on them – do you mean to concentrate on how they sound or the “feelings” they invoke? You don't have to visualise pyramids for “Fa Ra On, its just an option, its best not to visualise anything with La Ra S. You just concentrate on doing them without thinking about how they sound or feel. Can anyone tell me what it means to trill the \"R\" in the Mantra \"La Ra S\"? My first language is French, so does it mean to roll the R as we do in French?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" - - 7 I think it would be like the French, but I don't know exactly how that is pronounced. The 'r' is trilled in many languages, although I am not familiar with most of them. I know that it's trilled in Welsh and in some Arabic. I've been using the mantra's now every night since I got the lesson, the first night I felt like my foot twisted up and started to wiggle about, and I don't think it was my actual foot as I didn't seem to feel any resistance from the bed covers. The second night I felt my thumb suddenly jump up as well, then I felt the sensation in my feet disappear and this slowly worked its way up though my legs, then my hands and up my arms. Does all this sound normal, am I on the right track? The itching feeling on my face and other places, my back and neck, what is that? I try and restrain from scratching but it just gets too much and I cant focus on the heart when it happens. Also I can't seem to stay still when I wake up, I always move. Any advise on how I can stop moving first thing in the morning? Yes, it's normal and you are on the right track, but when your foot twisted up and your thumb suddenly jumped up, you should have slowly got up, because the bodies had already split. The itching is highlighted by an ego, if you go back to concentrating on the exercise, it will reduce and go away, then you find at future times it is not there or goes away easily. Ignore it. The body is trained with practice, you just keep going and eventually you will get there. I was just wondering, when I projected before, or at least when I know I have projected I have my vision, my head is out. But with the foot thing and thumb, everything was dark like my eyes were still closed. If I were to get up at this point what would happen? Would I get my sight? It feels like the bottom half of my body is out and the top half is still in the physical, is that possible? If you got up at that point, you could have projected, even though it was dark, because the bodies were already separating. It may or may not still be dark depending often on your state. If you get into the Astral and its dark, you can use something to clear it called a conjuration, which I will explain about later on this course. I have found that when I do any of the concentration practices in order to project, after a while, I get absolutely freezing feet! I never experience cold feet at any other time except when I am practicing these astral exercises and the longer I do the exercise for the colder they get. It has got to the point where I have to wear ski socks every time I do a practice and my feet are still cold! Has anyone else experienced this? Mark, do you know why this might be? "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" - - 8Yes, the body gets colder as we fall asleep, we normally don't notice it, but if we try to Astral project, we go much further into the process of sleep and are aware of the increasing cold. I suppose too that some are more affected than others. I don't have a clue if I'm saying the mantras at the right speed or tone. The ones with elongated vowels are pronounced slowly for as long as each breath lasts. Hi Mark, Well I think I had my first experience, but I'm not sure. It scared me to death though. I was lying on my side saying the mantras out loud and the deeper I felt relaxed, I started saying them to myself. The heartbeat was really noticeable too. Well, I felt myself trying to roll over and get up but at the same time I was scared and yelling no and for someone to help me! It was like a force was pulling at me but the fear I felt was unbelievable. I even found myself trying to grab my hubby's arm beside me to keep from leaving my body. Then I woke up. Was I almost there or was this something else? I have never experienced anything like this before. I was aware of everything during all this. Also, I read that once you have the ability to project, you can visit anyplace you want to go and even go see loved ones that live far away. Is this true? Yes you were there, you had split and were leaving your physical body, if you hadn't been so afraid you would have gone right out into the room in the Astral. You learn eventually that there is nothing to be afraid of; the fear of the unknown can be strong in the beginning. Fear generally is what we call an 'ego', if you learn how to get rid of them, then this combined with Alchemy, (both in future courses) will gradually remove fear. Once you are in the Astral, through whatever means, you can travel to most places by visualising them. I read through the article and practice on the Mantra Egypto. I have been doing it 1 week now before when I go to bed with only little results, that was until last night. As I was doing the Mantras Egypto I feel asleep, then I woke up and realized that I was separating from my body, and it seem like I was in some sort of weird trance. I was conscious and was having trouble separating from my body. I was reaching, pulling on anything I can reach for, scared and confused. I forgot everything I was taught in the previous lessons about how to handle these situations. The thing that scared me the most was before my eyes a big teddy bear appeared sitting in my chair and turned and looked at me. This scared me so much that I screamed to myself to wake up!!! It took a little while but I eventually woke up scared. I was not scared because something threatened me, I was scared of the unknown. Scared because it took me a while to come back to my body. Scared because this was actually happened. After all that happened I told myself after I woke up I will never try to Astral Project again. Now after I thought about it, I realize this is a gift and I should use it. Tell me how can I overcome my fear of the unknown? There is a fear of the unknown that you can overcome with experience. Fear generally can be overcome with alchemy, which will be explained about in the esoteric course. This gives an inner strength."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" - - 9 The teddy bear is likely to show you that in the state you were in, even the most harmless thing was causing you to be afraid. Remember though that negative forces use fear to stop any astral investigation, if you give into them they will have won, but if you don't you will find a whole new world opening up for you. Every night, I practice the Fa Ra On mantra, until falling asleep. But I find it difficult to project with mantra. I am not used to it but I will get used to it and practice the techniques given in these courses. I just hope it will work some day. If you persist you can find that it eventually works, but everything takes practice to achieve. As an alternative with the mantra Fa Ra On, pronounce it while visualising the pyramids, as real as you can, look at a picture of the pyramids beforehand if you think it will help. The physical pronouncing of the mantra aloud shouldn't go for long, or you may not attract the sleep. When you try a mantra, when you are doing it internally do it softly, so that you attract the sleep.
