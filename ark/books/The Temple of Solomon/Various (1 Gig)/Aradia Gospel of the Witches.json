Pitré, or the articles contributedby “Lady Vere de Vere” to the Italian Rivista, or that of J. H. Andrews to Folk-Lore,{1} he will beaware that there are in Italy great numbers of strege, fortune-tellers or witches, who divine by cards,perform strange ceremonies in which spirits are supposed to be invoked, make and sell amulets,and, in fact, comport themselves generally as their reputed kind are wont to do, be they BlackVoodoos in America or sorceresses anywhere.But the Italian /strega/ or sorceress is in certain respects a different character from these. In mostcases she comes of a family in which her calling or art has been practised for many generations. Ihave no doubt that there are instances in which the ancestry remounts to mediaeval, Roman, or itmay be Etruscan times. The result has naturally been the accumulation in such families of much tra-dition. But in Northern Italy, as its literature indicates, though there has been some slight gatheringof fairy tales and popular superstitions by scholars, there has never existed the least interest asregarded the strange lore of the witches, nor any suspicion that it embraced an incredible quantity ofold Roman minor myths and legends, such as Ovid has recorded, but of which much escaped himand all other Latin writers.{2}This ignorance was greatly aided by the wizards themselves, in making a profound secret of all theirtraditions, urged thereto by fear of the priests. In fact, the latter all unconsciously actually contributedimmensely to the preservation of such lore, since the charm of the forbidden is very great, andwitchcraft, like the truffle, grows best and has its raciest flavour when most deeply hidden. Howeverthis may be, both priest and wizard are vanishing now with incredible rapidity — it has even struck aFrench writer that a Franciscan in a railway carriage is a strange anomaly — and a few more yearsof newspapers and bicycles (Heaven knows what it will be when flying-machines appear!) will proba-bly cause an evanishment of all.However, they die slowly, and even yet there are old people in the Romagna of the North who knowthe Etruscan names of the Twelve Gods, and invocations to Bacchus, Jupiter, and Venus, Mercury,and the Lares or ancestral spirits, and in the cities are women who prepare strange amulets, overwhich they mutter spells, all known in the old Roman time, and who can astonish even the learnedby their legends of Latin gods, mingled with lore which may be found in Cato or Theocritus. With oneof these I became intimately acquainted in 1886, and have ever since employed her specially to col-lect among her sisters of the hidden spell in many places all the traditions of the olden time knownto them. It is true that I have drawn from other sources, but this woman by long practice has perfect-ly learned what few understand, or just what I want, and how to extract it from those of her kind.Among other strange relics, she succeeded, after many years, in obtaining the following “Gospel”,which I have in her handwriting. A full account of its nature with many details will be found in anAppendix. I do not know definitely whether my informant derived a part of these traditions from writ-tensources or oral narration, but believe it was chiefly the latter. However, there are a few wizardswho copy or preserve documents relative to their art. I have not seen my collector since the“Gospel” was sent to me. I hope at some future time to be better informed.Page 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"For brief explanation I may say that witchcraft is known to its votaries as la vecchia religione, or theold religion, of which Diana is the Goddess, her daughter Aradia(or Herodias) the female Messiah,and that this little work sets forth how the latter was born, came down to earth, established witchesand witchcraft, and then returned to heaven. With it are given the ceremonies and invocations orincantations to be addressed to Dianaand Aradia, the exorcism of Cain, and the spells of the holy-stone, rue, and verbena, constituting, as the text declares, the regular church-service, so to speak,which is to be chanted or pronounced at the witch-meetings. There are also included the very curi-ous incantations or benedictions of the honey, meal, and salt, or cakes of the witch-supper, which iscuriously classical, and evidently a relic of the Roman Mysteries.The work could have been extended ad infinitumby adding to it the ceremonies and incantationswhich actually form a part of the Scripture of Witchcraft, but as these are nearly all — or at least ingreat number — to be found in my works entitled Etruscan-Roman Remainsand Legends ofFlorence, I have hesitated to compile such a volume before ascertaining whether there is a suffi-ciently large number of the public who would buy such a work.Since writing the foregoing I have met with and read a very clever and entertaining work entitled IlRomanzo dei Settimani, G. Cavagnari, 1889, in which the author, in the form of a novel, vividlydepicts the manners, habits of thought, and especially the nature of witchcraft, and the many super-stitions current among the peasants in Lombardy. Unfortunately, notwithstanding his extensiveknowledge of the subject, it never seems to have occurred to the narrator that these traditions wereanything but noxious nonsense or abominably un-Christian folly. That there exists in them marvel-lousrelics of ancient mythology and valuable folklore, which is the very cor cordiumof history, is asuncared for by him as it would be by a common Zoccoloneor tramping Franciscan. One would thinkit might have been suspected by a man who knew that a witch really endeavoured to kill seven peo-ple as a ceremony or rite, in order to get the secret of endless wealth, that such a sorceress musthave had a store of wondrous legends; but of all this there is no trace, and it is very evident thatnothing could be further from his mind than that there was anything /interesting/ from a higher ormore genial point of view in it all.His book, in fine, belongs to the very great number of those written on ghosts and superstition sincethe latter has fallen into discredit, in which the authors indulge in much satirical and very safe butcheap ridicule of what to them is merely vulgar and false. Like Sir Charles Coldstream, they havepeeped in the crater of Vesuvius after is had ceased to “erupt”, and found “nothing in it.” But therewas something in it once; and the man of science, which Sir Charles was not, still finds a great dealin the remains, and the antiquarian a Pompeii or a Herculaneum — ‘tis said there are still sevenburied cities to unearth. I have done what little (it is really very little) I could, to disinter somethingfrom the dead volcano of Italian sorcery.If this be the manner in which Italian witchcraft is treated by the most intelligent writer who hasdepicted it, it will not be deemed remarkable that there are few indeed who will care whether there isa veritable Gospel of the Witches, apparently of extreme antiquity, embodying the belief in a strangecounter-religion which has held its own from pre-historic time to the present day. “Witchcraft is allrubbish, or something worse,” said old writers, “and therefore all books about it are nothing better.” Isincerely trust, however, that these pages may fall into the hands of at least a few who will think bet-ter of them.Page 3\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I should, however, in justice to those who do care to explore dark and bewildering paths, explainclearly that witch-lore is hidden with most scrupulous care from all save a very few in Italy, just as itis among the Chippeway Medas or the Black Voodoo. In the novel to the life of I Settimanian aspi-rant is represented as living with a witch and acquiring or picking up with pain, scrap by scrap, herspells and incantations, giving years to it. So my friend the late M. Dragomanoff told me how a cer-tain man in Hungary, having learned that he had collected many spells (which were indeed subse-quently published in folklore journals), stole into the scholar’s room and surreptitiously copied them,so that the next year when Dragomanoff returned, he found the thief in full practice as a bloomingmagician. Truly he had not got many incantations, only a dozen or so, but a very little will go a greatway in the business, and I venture to say there is perhaps hardly a single witch in Italy who knowsas many as I have published, mine having been assiduously collected from many, far and wide.Everything of the kind which is written is, moreover, often destroyed with scrupulous care by priestsor penitents, or the vast number who have a superstitious fear of even being in the same house withsuch documents, so that I regard the rescue of the Vangeloas something which is to say the leastremarkable.Page 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CONTENTS.PREFACE.CHAPTER I.How Diana Gave Birth to Aradia (Herodias).Of the sufferings of Mankind, and how Dianasent Aradiaon earth to relieve them by teaching resistance and Sorcery — Poem addressed to Mankind — How to invoke Dianaor Aradia.CHAPTER II.The Sabbat — Treguenda or Witch-Meeting.How to consecrate the supper — Conjuration of the mealand of Salt — Invocation of Cain — Conjuration of Dianaand to Aradia.CHAPTER III.How Diana Made the Stars and the Rain.CHAPTER IV.The Charm of the Stones Consecrated to Diana —The Incantation of Perforated Stones — The Spellor Conjuration of the Round Stone.CHAPTER V.The Conjuration of the Lemon and Pins —Incantation to Diana.CHAPTER VI.A Spell to Win Love.CHAPTER VII.To Find or Buy Anything, or to Have GoodFortune Thereby.CHAPTER VIII.To Have a Good Vintage and Very Good Wine Bythe Aid of Diana.CHAPTER IX.Tana and Endamone, or Diana and Endymion.CHAPTER X.Madonna Diana.A Legend of Cettardo, and how Diana appeared with tenBridesmaids to give away a Bride — Incantation to Dianafor a Wedding.Page 5\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI.The House of the Wind.Showing how Diana rescued a Lady from Death at theHouse of the Wind in Volterra.CHAPTER XII.Tana or Diana, The Moon-Goddess.CHAPTER XIII.Diana and the Children.CHAPTER XIV.The Goblin Messengers of Diana and Mercury.CHAPTER XV.Laverna.APPENDIX.Comments on the Foregoing Texts.The Children of Diana, or How the Fairies Were Born.Diana, Queen of the Serpents, Giver of the Gift of Languages.Diana as Giving Beauty and Restoring Strength.Note.Page 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ARADIAOR THEGOSPEL OF THE WITCHESCHAPTER I.How Diana Gave Birth to Aradia (Herodias).“It is Diana! Lo!She rises crescented.”— Keat’s Endymion.“Make more brightThe Star Queen’s crescent on her marriage night.”— Ibid.This is the Gospel (Vangelo) of the Witches:Diana greatly loved her brother Lucifer, the god of the Sun and of the Moon, the god of Light(Splendor), who was so proud of his beauty, and who for his pride was driven from Paradise.Diana had by her brother a daughter, to whom they gave the name of Aradia (i.e.Herodias).In those days there were on earth many rich and many poor.The rich made slaves of all the poor.In those days were many slaves who were cruelly treated; in every palace tortures, in every castleprisoners.Many slaves escaped. They fled to the country: thus they became thieves and evil folk. Instead ofsleeping by night, they plotted escape and robbed their masters, and then slew them. So they dweltin the mountains and forests as robbers and assassins, all to avoid slavery.Diana said one day to her daughter Aradia:E vero che tu sei uno spirito,Ma tu sei nata per essere ancora,Mortale, e tu devi andareSulla terra e fare da maestraA donne e a’ uomini che avrannoVolentà di inparare la tua scuolaChe sara composta di stregonerie.Page 7\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Non devi essere come la figlia di Caino,E della razza che sono devenutiScellerati infami a causa dei maltrattamenti,Come Giudei e Zingari,Tutti ladri e briganti,Tu non divieni...Tu sarai (sempre) la prima strega,La prima strega divenuta nel mondo,Tu insegnerai l’arte di avvelenare,Di avvelenare (tutti) i signori,Di farli morti nei loro palazzi,Di legare il spirito del oppressore,E dove si trova un contadino ricco e avaro,Insegnare alle strege tue alunne,Come rovinare suo raccoltoCon tempesta, folgore e balen,Con grandine e vento.Quando un prete ti fara del male,Del male colle sue bene di’Zioni,Tu le farei (sempre) un doppio maleCol mio nome, col nome di /Diana/,Regina delle streghe...Quando i nobili e prete vi dirannoDovete credere nel Padre, Figlio,E Maria, rispondete gli sempre,“Il, vostro dio Padre e MariaSono tre diavoli...“Il vero dio Padre non e il vostro —Il vostro dio — io sono venutaPer distruggere la gente cattivaE la distruggero....“Voi altri poveri soffrite anche la fame,E lavorato malo e molte volte;Soffrite anche la prigione;Mapero avete una anima,Una anima più buona, e nell’altra,Nell’altra mondo voi starete bene,E gli altri male.”...Page 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Translation.‘Tis true indeed that thou a spirit art,But thou wert born but to become againA mortal;

Lucifer, her brother and son, her-self and her other half, was the light.And when Dianasaw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her brotherLucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire. Wishing to receive the light again into herdarkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire. This desire was the Dawn.But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he was the light which fliesinto the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which flies before the cat.Then Dianawent to the fathers of the Beginning, to the mothers, the spirits who were before the firstspirit, and lamented unto them that she could not prevail with Lucifer. And they praised her for hercourage; they told her that to rise she must fall; to become the chief of goddesses she must becomea mortal.And in the ages, in the course of time, when the world was made, Dianawent on earth, as didLucifer, who had fallen, and Dianataught magic and sorcery, whence came witches and fairies andgoblins — all that is like man, yet not mortal.And it came thus that Dianatook the form of a cat. Her brother had a cat whom he loved beyond allcreatures, and it slept every night on his bed, a cat beautiful beyond all other creatures, a fairy: hedid not know it.Dianaprevailed with the cat to change forms with her; so she lay with her brother, and in the dark-ness assumed her own form, and so by Lucifer became the mother of Aradia. But when in the morn-ing he found that he lay by his sister, and that light had been conquered by darkness, Lucifer wasextremely angry; but Dianasang to him a spell, a song of power, and he was silent, the song of thenight which soothes to sleep; he could say nothing. So Dianawith her wiles of witchcraft so charmedhim that he yielded to her love. This was the first fascination; she hummed the song, it was as thebuzzing of bees (or a top spinning round), a spinning-wheel spinning life. She spun the lives of allmen; all things were spun from the wheel of Diana. Lucifer turned the wheel.Dianawas not known to the witches and spirits, the fairies and elves who dwell in desert place, thegoblins, as their mother; she hid herself in humility and was a mortal, but by her will she rose againabove all.

Therefore the invocation has been so worded as to make itapplicable to literary finds; but those who wish to buy anything whatever on equally favourableterms, have but to vary the request, retaining the introduction, in which the magic virtue consists. Icannot, however, resist the conviction that this is most applicable to, and will succeed best with,researches for objects of antiquity, scholarship, and art, and it should accordingly be deeplyimpressed on the memory of every bric-à-brac hunter and bibliographer. It should be observed, andthat earnestly, that the prayer, far from being answered, will turn to the contrary or misfortune, unlessthe one who repeats it does so in fullest faith, and this cannot be acquired by merely saying to one-self, “I believe.” For to acquire real faith in anything requires long and serious mental discipline,there being, in fact, no subject which is so generally spoken of and so little understood. Here,indeed, I am speaking seriously, for the man who can train his faith to actually believe in and culti-vate or develop his will can really work what the world by common consent regards as miracles. Atime will come when this principle will form not only the basis of all education, but also that of allmoral and social culture. I have, I trust, fully set it forth in a work entitled “Have you a Strong Will? orhow to Develop it or any other Faculty or Attribute of the Mind, and render it Habitual,” &c.

If he incline to beauty in female form, he will meet withbonnes fortunes; if a man of business, bargains will be his. The botanist who repeats it before goinginto the fields will probably discover some new plant, and the astronomer by night be almost certainto run against a brand-new planet, or at least an asteroid. It should be repeated before going to theraces, to visit friends, places of amusement, to buy or sell, to make speeches, and specially beforehunting or any nocturnal goings-forth, since Dianais the goddess of the chase and of night.

For it is firstly devoted to a subject which has received little attention — the con-nection of Diana as the moon with Bacchus, although in the great Dizionario Storico Mitologico, byPozzoli and others, it is expressly asserted that in Greece her worship was associated with that ofBacchus, Esculapius, and Apollo. The connecting link is the horn. In a medal of Alexander Severus,Diana of Ephesus bears the horn of plenty. This is the horn or horn of the new moon, sacred toDiana. According to Callimachus, Apollo himself built an altar consisting entirely of horns to Diana.The connection of the horn with wine is obvious. It was usual among the old Slavonians for thepriest of Svantevit, the Sun-god, to see if the horn which the idol held in his hand was full of wine, inorder to prophesy a good harvest for the coming year. If it was filled, all was right; if not, he filled thehorn, drank from it, and replaced the horn in the hand, and predicted that all would eventually gowell.{17} It cannot fail to strike the reader that this ceremony is strangely like that of the Italian invo-cation, the only difference being that in one the Sun, and in the other the Moon is invoked to securea good harvest.In the Legends of Florencethere is one of the Via del Corno, in which the hero, falling into a vasttun or tinaof wine, is saved from drowning by sounding a horn with tremendous power. At thesound, which penetrates to an incredible distance, even to unknown lands, all come rushing as ifenchanted to save him. In this conjuration, Diana, in the depths of heaven, is represented as rushingat the sound of the horn, and leaping through doors or windows to save the vintage of the one whoblows. There is a certain singular affinity in these stories.In the story of the Via del Corno, the hero is saved by the Red Goblin or Robin Goodfellow, whogives him a horn, and it is the same sprite who appears in the conjuration of the Round Stone,which is sacred to Diana. This is because the spirit is nocturnal, and attendant on Diana-Titania.Kissing the hand to the new moon is a ceremony of unknown antiquity, and Job, even in his time,regarded it as heathenish and forbidden — which always means antiquated and out of fashion — aswhen he declared (xxxi, 26, 27), “If I beheld the moon walking in brightness... and my heart hathbeen secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand... this also were an iniquity to be punishedby the Judge, for I should have denied the God that is above.” From which it may or ought to beinferred that Job did not understand that God made the moon and appeared in all His works, or elsehe really believed the moon was an independent deity. In any case, it is curious to see the old for-bidden rite still living, and as heretical as ever.The tradition, as given to me, very evidently omits a part of the ceremony, which may be suppliedfrom classic authority. When the peasant performs the rite, he must not act as once a certainAfrican, who was a servant of a friend of mine, did. The coloured man’s duty was to pour out everymorning a libation of rum to a fetish — and he poured it down his own throat. The peasant shouldalso sprinkle the vines, just as the Devonshire farmers, who observed all Christmas ceremonies,sprinkled, also from a horn, their apple-trees.Page 35\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX.Tana and Endamone, or Diana and Endymion.“Hic ultra Endymionem indormit negligentiae.”“Now it is fabled that Endymion, admitted to Olympus,whence he was expelled for want of respect to Juno, wasbanished for thirty years to earth. And having been allowedto sleep this time in a cave of Mount Latmos, Diana, smittenwith his beauty visited him every night till she had byhim fifty daughters and one son. And after this Endymionwas recalled to Olympus.”— Diz. Stor. Mitol.The following legend and the spells were given under the name or title of Tana.

And when there, she assumed theappearance of Tana, whom he loved, so that he was delighted to behold her, as he thought, andwelcomed her with passionate embraces. Yet this gave him into her power, for it enabled her to per-form a certain magic spell by clipping a lock of his hair.{18}Then she went home, and taking a piece of sheep’s intestine, formed of it a purse, and in this sheput that which she had taken, with a red and a black ribbon bound together, with a feather, and pep-per and salt, and then sang a song. These were the words, a song of witchcraft of the very old time.Scongiurazione.Ho formato questo sachetto a Endamone,E la mia vendetta per l’amore,Ch’io ti portavo, e non ero corrisposta,Una altra tu l’amavi:La bella dea Tana tu amavi,E tu non l’avrai: di passioneTi struggerai, volonta di fare,Di fare al amore tu avrai,E non la potrai fare.

And so it is to this day, that whoever would make love with him or her whosleeps, should have recourse to the beautiful Tana, and so doing there will be success.This legend, while agreeing in many details with the classical myth, is strangely intermingled withpractices of witchcraft, but even these, if investigated, would all prove to be as ancient as the rest ofthe text. Thus the sheep’s intestine — used instead of the red woollen bag which is employed inbeneficent magic — the red and black ribbon, which mingles threads of joy and woe — the (pea-cock’s) feather or la penna maligna— pepper and salt, occur in many other incantations, but alwaysto bring evil and cause suffering.{20}I have never seen it observed, but it is true, that Keats in his exquisite poem of Endymioncomplete-ly departs from or ignores the whole spirit and meaning of the ancient myth, while in this rude witch-song it is minutely developed. The conception is that of a beautiful youth furtively kissed in his slum-ber by Dianaof reputed chastity. The ancient myth is, to begin with, one of darkness and light, orday and night, from which are born the fifty-one (now fifty-two) weeks of the year. This is Diana, thenight, and Apollo, the sun, or light in another form. It is expressed as love-making during sleep,which, when it occurs in real life, generally has for active agent some one who, without beingabsolutely modest, wishes to preserve appearances. The established character of Dianaamong theInitiated (for which she was bitterly reviled by the Fathers of the Church) was that of a beautiful hyp-ocrite who pursued amours in silent secrecy.“Thus as the moon Endymion lay with her,So did Hippolytus and Verbio.”(On which the reader may consult Tertullian,De Falsa Religione, lib. ii. cap. 17, and Pico deMirandula, La Strega.)But there is an exquisitely subtle, delicately strange idea or ideal in the conception of the apparentlychaste “clear cold moon” casting her living light by stealth into the hidden recesses of darkness andacting in the occult mysteries of love or dreams. So it struck Byron{21} as an original thought thatthe sun does not shine on half the forbidden deeds which the moon witnesses, and this is empha-sised in the Italian witch-poem. In it the moon is distinctly invoked as the protectress of a strangeand secret amour, and as the deity to be especially invoked for such love-making. The one invokingsays that the window is opened, that the moon may shine splendidly on the bed, even as our love isbright and beautiful... and I pray her to give great rapture — sfogo— to us.The quivering, mysteriously beautiful light of the moon, which seems to cast a spirit of intelligence oremotion over silent Nature, and dimly half awaken it — raising shadows into thoughts and causingevery tree and rock to assume the semblance of a living form, but one which, while shimmering andbreathing, still sleeps in a dream — could not escape the Greeks, and they expressed it as Dianaembracing Endymion. But as night is the time sacred to secrecy, and as the true Diana of theMysteries was the Queen of Night, who wore the crescent moon, and mistress of all hidden things,including “sweet secret sins and loved iniquities,” there was attached to this myth far more thanmeets the eye. And just in the degree to which Diana was believed to be Queen of the emancipatedwitches and of Night, or the nocturnal Venus-Astarte herself, so far would the love for sleepingEndymion be understood as sensual, yet sacred and allegorical. And it is entirely in this sense thatthe witches in Italy, who, may claim with some right to be its true inheritors, have preserved andunderstood the myth.Page 39\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"It is a realisationof forbidden or secret love, with attraction to the dimly seen beautiful-by-moonlight,with the fairy or witch-like charm of the supernatural — a romanceall combined in a single strangeform — the spell of Night!“There is a dangerous silence in that hourA stillness which leaves room for the full soulTo open all itself, without the powerOf calling wholly back its self-control;The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,Sheds beauty and deep softness o’er the whole,Breathes also to the heart, and o’er it throwsA loving languor which is not repose.”This is what is meant by the myth of Diana and Endymion.

N. Rolfe.Once there was, in the very old time in Cettardo Alto, a girl of astonishing beauty, and she wasbetrothed to a young man who was as remarkable for good looks as herself; but though well bornand bred, the fortune or misfortunes of war or fate had made them both extremely poor. And if theyoung lady had one fault, it was her great pride, nor would she willingly be married unless in goodstyle, with luxury and festivity, in a fine garment, with many bridesmaids of rank.And this became to the beautiful Rorasa— for such was her name — such an object of desire, thather head was half turned with it, and the other girls of her acquaintance, to say nothing of the manymen whom she had refused, mocked her so bitterly, asking her when the fine wedding was to be,with many other jeers and sneers, that at last in a moment of madness she went to the top of a hightower, whence she cast herself; and to make it worse, there was below a terrible ravine (balza) intowhich she fell.Yet she took no harm, for as she fell there appeared to her a very beautiful woman, truly not ofearth, who took her by the hand and bore her through the air to a safe place.Then all the people round about who saw or heard of this thing cried out, “Lo, a miracle!” and theycame and made a great festival, and would fain persuade Rorasa that she had been saved by theMadonna.But the lady who had saved her, coming to her secretly, said, “If thou hast any desire, follow theGospel of Diana, or what is called the Gospel of the Witches (Il Vangelo delle Strege), who worshipthe moon.”“Se la Luna adoreraiTutto tu otterai”“If thou adorest Luna, thenWhat thou desir’st thou shalt obtain!”Then the beautiful girl went forth alone by night to the fields, and kneeling on a stone in an old ruin,she worshipped the moon and invoked Dianathus: —Diana, bella Diana!Tu che della grande cadutaMi ai bene salvata!Ti prego di farmi una altra grazia,Di farmi far’ un bello sposalizio,Una sposalizio ricco e ‘compagnatoDa molte signore...Se questa grazia mi faraiSempre il Vangelo delle StregeIo asseriro.Page 41\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Diana, beautiful Diana!Thou who didst save from a dreadful deathWhen I did fall into the dark ravine!I pray thee grant me still another grace.Give me one glorious wedding, and with itFull many bridesmaids, beautiful and grand;And if this favour thou wilt grant to me,True to the Witches’ Gospel I will be!When Rorasa awoke in the morning, she found herself in another house, where all was far moremagnificent, and having risen, a beautiful maid led her into another room, where she was dressed ina superb wedding-garment of white silk with diamonds, for it was her wedding-dress indeed. Thenthere appeared ten young ladies, all splendidly attired, and with them and many distinguished per-sons she went to the church in a carriage. And all the streets were filled with music and people bear-ing flowers.So she found the bridegroom, and was wedded to her heart’s desire, ten times more grandly thanshe had ever dreamed of. Then, after the ceremony, there was spread a feast at which all the nobili-ty of Cettardo were present, and, moreover, the whole town, rich and poor, were feasted.When the wedding was finished, the bridesmaids made every one a magnificent present to the bride— one gave diamonds, another a parchment (written) in gold, after which they asked permission togo all together into the sacristy. And there they remained for some hours undisturbed, until the priestsent his chiericoto inquire whether they wanted anything. But what was the youth’s amazement atbeholding, not the ten bridesmaids, but their ten images or likenesses in wood and in terra-cotta,with that of Diana standing on a moon, and they were all so magnificently made and adorned as tobe of immense value.Therefore the priest put these images into the church, which is the most ancient in Cettardo, andnow in many churches you may see the Madonna and Moon, but it is Diana — la Dea della Luna.The name Rorasa seems to indicate the Latin rosthe dew, rorare, to bedew, rorulenta, bedewed —in fact, the goddess of the dew. Her great fall and being lifted by Diana suggest the fall of dew bynight, and its rising in vapour under the influence of the moon. It is possible that this is a very oldLatin mythic tale. The white silk and diamonds indicate the dew.Page 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI.The House of the Wind.“List to the whoop and whistle of the winds,Their hollow drone as they come roaring on,For strength hath many a voice, and when arousedThe flying tempest calls with awful joyAnd echoes as it strikes the mountain-side,Then crashes in the forest. Hear the cry!Surely a god hath set his lions looseAnd laughs to hear them as they rage afar.”— C. G. Leland.The following story does not belong to the Gospel of the Witches, but I add it as it confirms the factthat the worship of Dianaexisted for a long time contemporary with Christianity. Its full title in theoriginal MS, which was written out by Maddalena, after hearing it from a man who was a native ofVolterra, is La Pellegrina della Casa al Vento— “The Female Pilgrim of the House of the Wind.” Itmay be added that, as the tale declares, the house in question is still standing.There is a peasants house at the beginning of the hill or ascent leading to Volterra, and it is calledthe House of the Wind. Near it there once stood a small palace, wherein dwelt a married couple,who had but one child, a daughter, whom they adored. Truly if the child had but a headache, theyeach had a worse attack from fear.Little by little as the girl grew older, and all the thought of the mother, who was very devout, was thatshe should become a nun. But the girl did not like this, and declared that she hoped to be marriedlike others. And when looking from her window one day, she saw and heard the birds singing in thevines and among the trees all so merrily, she said to her mother that she hoped some day to have afamily of little birds of her own, singing round her in a cheerful nest. At which the mother was soangry that she gave her daughter a cuff. And the young lady wept, but replied with spirit, that if beat-en or treated in any such manner, that she would certainly soon find some way to escape and getmarried, for she had no idea of being made a nun of against her will.At hearing this the mother was seriously frightened, for she knew the spirit of her child, and wasafraid lest the girl already had a lover, and would make a great scandal over the blow; and turning itall over, she thought of an elderly lady of good family, but much reduced, who was famous for herintelligence, learning, and power of persuasion, and she thought, “This will be just the person toinduce my daughter to become pious, and fill her head with devotion and make a nun of her.” Soshe sent for this clever person, who was at once appointed the governess and constant attendant ofthe young lady, who, instead of quarrelling with her guardian, became devoted to her.However, everything in this world does not go exactly as we would have it, and no one knows whatfish or crab may hide under a rock in a river. For it so happened that the governess was not aCatholic at all, as will presently appear, and did not vex her pupil with any threats of a nun’s life, noreven with an approval of it.Page 43\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"It came to pass that the young lady, who was in the habit of lying awake on moonlight nights to hearthe nightingales sing, thought she heard her governess in the next room, of which the door wasopen, rise and go forth on the great balcony.

Then the latter, after a little reflection, first binding her to a secrecy oflife and death, for, as she declared, it was a matter of great peril, spoke as follows: —“I, like thee, was instructed when young by priests to worship an invisible god. But an old woman inwhom I had great confidence once said to me, ‘Why worship a deity whom you cannot see, whenthere is the Moon in all her splendour visible? Worship her. Invoke Diana, the goddess of the Moon,and she will grant your prayers.’ This shalt thou do, obeying the Vangelo, the Gospel of (the Witchesand of) Diana, who is Queen of the Fairies and of the Moon.”Now the young lady being persuaded, was converted to the worship of Dianaand the Moon, andhaving prayed with all her heart for a lover (having learned the conjuration to the goddess),{22} wassoon rewarded by the attention and devotion of a brave and wealthy cavalier, who was indeed asadmirable a suitor as any one could desire. But the mother, who was far more bent on gratifying vin-dictiveness and cruel vanity than on her daughter’s happiness, was infuriated at this, and when thegentleman came to her, she bade him begone, for her daughter was vowed to become a nun, and anun she should be or die.Then the young lady was shut up in a cell in a tower, without even the company of her governess,and put to strong and hard pain, being made to sleep on the stone floor, and would have died ofhunger had her mother had her way.Then in this dire need she prayed to Dianato set her free; when lo! she found the prison door unfas-tened, and easily escaped. Then having obtained a pilgrim’s dress, she travelled far and wide,teaching and preaching the religion of old times, the religion of Diana, the Queen of the Fairies andof the Moon, the goddess of the poor and the oppressed.And the fame of her wisdom and beauty went forth over all the land, and people worshipped her,calling her La Bella Pellegrina. At last her mother, hearing of her, was in a greater rage than ever,and, in fine, after much trouble, succeeded in having her again arrested and cast into prison. Andthen in evil temper indeed she asked her whether she would become a nun: to which she repliedthat it was not possible, because she had left the Catholic Church and become a worshipper ofDianaand of the Moon.And the end of it was that the mother, regarding her daughter as lost, gave her up to the priests tobe put to torture and death, as they did all who would not agree with them or who left their religion.But the people were not well pleased with this, because they adored her beauty and goodness, andthere were few who had not enjoyed her charity.But by the aid of her lover she obtained, as a last grace, that on the night before she was to be tor-tured and executed she might, with a guard, go forth into the garden of the palace and pray.Page 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"This she did, and standing by the door of the house, which is still there, prayed in the light of the fullmoon to Diana, that she might be delivered from the dire persecution to which she had been sub-jected, since even her own parents had willingly given her over to an awful death.Now her parents and the priests, and all who sought her death, were in the palace watching lest sheshould escape.When lo! in answer to her prayer there came a terrible tempest and overwhelming wind, a stormsuch as man had never seen before, which overthrew and swept away the palace with all who werein it; there was not one stone left upon another, nor one soul alive of all who were there. The godshad replied to the prayer.The young lady escaped happily with her lover, wedded him, and the house of the peasant wherethe lady stood is still called La Casa al Vento, or the House of the Wind.This is very accurately the storyas I received it, but I freely admit that I have very much condensedthe language of the original text, which consists of twenty pages, and which, as regards needlesspadding, indicates a capacity on the part of the narrator to write an average modern fashionablenovel, even a second-rate French one, which is saying a great deal. It is true that there are in it nodetailed descriptions of scenery, skies, trees, or clouds — and a great deal might be made ofVolterra in that way — but it is prolonged in a manner which shows a gift for it. However, the narra-tive itself is strangely original and vigorous, for it is such a relic of pure classic heathenism, and sucha survival of faith in the old mythology, as all the reflected second-hand Hellenism of the AEsthetescannot equal. That a real worship of or belief in classic divinities should have survived to the presentday in the very land of Papacy itself, is a much more curious fact than if a living mammoth had beendiscovered in some out of the way corner of the earth, because the former is a human phenomenon.I foresee that the day will come, and that perhaps not so very far distant, when the world of scholarswill be amazed to consider to what a late period an immense body of antique tradition survived inNorthern Italy, and how indifferent the learned were regarding it; there having been in very truth onlyone man, and he a foreigner, who earnestly occupied himself with collecting and preserving it.It is very probably that there were as many touching episodes among the heathen martyrs who wereforced to give up their beloved deities, such as Diana, Venus, the Graces, and others, who wereworshipped for beauty, as there were even among the Christians who were thrown to the lions. Forthe heathen lovedtheir gods with a human personal sympathy, without mysticism or fear, as if theyhad been blood-relations; and there were many among them who really believed that such was thecase when some damsel who had made afaux pasgot out of it by attributing it all to some god,faun, or satyr; which is very touching. There is a great deal to be said for as well as against the idol-aters or worshippers of dolls, as I heard a small girl define them.Page 45\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XII.Tana, The Moon Goddess.The following story, which appeared originally in the Legends of Florence, collected from the peopleby me, does not properly belong to the Witch’s Gospel, as it is not strictly in accordance with it; andyet it could not well be omitted, since it is on the same subject. In it Dianaappears simply as thelunar goddess of chastity, therefore not as a witch. It was given to me as Fana, but my informantsaid that it might be Tana; she was not sure. As Tanaoccurs in another tale, and as the subject iscertainly Diana, there can hardly be a question of this.Tana, la Dea della Luna.Tana was a very beautiful girl, but extremely poor, and as modest and pure as she was beautiful andhumble. She went from one contadino to another, or from farm to farm to work, and thus led an hon-est life.There was a young boor, a very ugly, bestial, and brutish fellow, who was after his fashion ragingwith love for her, but she could not so much as bear to look at him, and repelled all his advances.But late one night, when she was returning alone from the farmhouse where she had worked to herhome, this man, who had hidden himself in a thicket, leaped out on her and cried, “Non mi sfug-gerati; sara mia!” — “Thou canst not flee; mine thou shalt be!”And seeing no help near, and only the full moon looking down on her from heaven, Tana in despaircast herself on her knees and cried to it: —“I have no one on earth to defend me,Thou alone dost see me in this strait;Therefore I pray to thee, O Moon!As thou art beautiful so thou art brightFlashing thy splendour over all mankind;Even so I pray thee light up the mindOf this poor ruffian, who would wrong me here,Even to the worst. Cast light into his soul,That he may let me be in peace, and thenReturn in all thy light unto my home!”When she had said this, there appeared before her a bright but shadowy form — uno ombra bianca— which said: —“Rise, and go to thy home!Thou has(sic) well deserved this grace;No one shall trouble thee more,Purest of all on earth!Thou shalt a goddess be,The Goddess of the Moon,Of all enchantment queen!”Page 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Thus it came to pass that Tana became thedeaor spirit of the Moon.Though the air be set to a different key, this is a poem of pure melody, and the same asWordsworth’s “Goody Blake and Harry Gill.” Both Tanaand the old dame are surprised and terrified;both pray to a power above: —“The cold, cold moon above her head,Thus on her knees did Goody pray;Young Harry heard what she had said,And icy cold he turned away.”The dramatic centre is just the same in both. The English ballad soberly turns into an incurable fit ofague inflicted on a greedy young boor; the Italian witch-poetess, with finer sense, or with more sym-pathy for the heroine, casts the brute aside without further mention, and apotheosises the maiden,identifying her with the Moon. The former is more practical and probable, the latter more poetical.And here it is worth while, despite digression, to remark what an immense majority there are of peo-ple who can perceive, feel, and value poetry in mere words or form— that is to say, objectively —and hardly know or note it when it is presented subjectively or as thought, but not put into some kindof verse or measure, or regulated form. This is a curious experiment and worth studying. Take apassage from some famous poet; write it out in pure simple prose, doing full justice to its real mean-ing, and if it still actually thrills or moves as poetry, then it is of the first class. But if it has lost itsglamour absolutely, it is second rateor inferior; for the best cannot be made out of mere words var-nished with associations, be they of thought or feeling.This is not such a far cry from the subject as might be deemed. Reading and feeling them subjec-tively, I am often struck by the fact that in these witch traditions which I have gathered there is awondrous poetry of thought, which far excels the efforts of many modern bards, and which onlyrequires the aid of some clever workman in words to assume the highest rank. A proof of what Ihave asserted may be found in the fact that, in such famous poems as the Finding of the Lyre, byJames Russell Lowell, and that on the invention of the pipe by Pan, by Mrs. Browning, that whichformed the most exquisite and refined portion of the original myths is omitted by both authors, sim-ply because they missed or did not perceive it. For in the former we are not told that it was thebreathing of the god Air(who was the inspiring soul of ancient music, and the Bellariaof modernwitch-mythology) on the dried filament of the tortoise, which suggested to Hermes the making aninstrument wherewith he made the music of the spheres and guided the course of the planets. As forMrs. Browning, she leaves out Syrinxaltogether, that is to say, the voice of the nymph still lingeringin the pipe which had been her body. Now to my mind the old prose narrative of these myths ismuch more deeply poetical and moving, and far more inspired with beauty and romance, than arethe well-rhymed and measured, but very imperfect versions given by our poets. And in fact, suchwant of intelligence or perception may be found in all the “classic” poems, not only of Keats, but ofalmost every poet of the age who has dealt in Greek subjects.Page 47\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Great license is allowed to painters and poets, but when they take a subjective, especially a deeptradition, and fail to perceive its real meaningor catch its point, and simply give us something verypretty, but not so inspired with meaning as the original, it can hardly be claimed that they have donetheir work as it might, or, in fact, should have been done. I find that this fault does not occur in theItalian or Tuscan witch-versions of the ancient fables; on the contrary, they keenly appreciate, andeven expand, the antique spirit. Hence I have often had occasion to remark that it was not impossi-ble that in some cases popular tradition, even as it now exists, has been preserved more fully andaccurately than we find it in any Latin writer.Now apropos of missing the point, I would remind certain very literal readers that if they find manyfaults of grammar, mis-spelling, and worse in the Italian texts in this book, they will not, as a distin-guished reviewer has done, attribute them all to the ignorance of the author, but to the imperfecteducation of the person who collected and recorded them. I am reminded of this by having seen in acirculating library a copy of my Legends of Florence, in which some good careful soul had takenpains with a pencil to correct all the archaisms. Wherein he or she was like a certain Boston proof-reader, who in a book of mine changed the spelling of many citations from Chaucer, Spenser, andothers into the purest, or impurest, Webster; he being under the impression that I was extremelyignorant of orthography. As for the writing in or injuring books, which always belong partly to posteri-ty, it is a sin of vulgarity as well as morality, and indicates what people aremore than they dream.“Only a cad as low as a thiefWould write in a book or turn down a leaf,Since ‘tis thievery, as well is known,To make free with that which is not our own.”Page 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII.Diana and the Children.“And there withall Diana gan appereWith bowe in hand right as an Hunteresse,And saydê, ‘Daughter, stint thine heavinesse!’And forth she wente and made a vanishing.”— Chaucer (C. T.), “The Knight’s Tale.”There was in Florence in the oldest time a noble family, but grown so poor that their giorni di festaorfeast-days were few and far between. However, they dwelt in their old palace (which was in thestreet now called La Via Cittadella), which was a fine old building, and so they kept up a brave showbefore the world, when many a day they hardly had anything to eat.Round this palace was a large garden, in which stood an ancient marble statue of Diana, like abeautiful woman who seemed to be running with a dog by her side. She held in her hand a bow, andon her forehead was a small moon. And it was said that by night, when all was still, the statuebecame like life and fled, and did not return till the moon set or the sun rose.The father of the family had two children, who were good and intelligent. On day they came homewith many flowers that had been given to them, and the little girl said to her brother: —“The beautiful lady with the bow ought to have some of these!”Saying this, they laid flowers before the stature(sic) and made a wreath, which the boy placed onher head.Just then the great poet and magician Virgil, who knew everything about the gods and fairies,entered the garden and said, smiling: —“You have made the offering of flowers to the goddess quite correctly, as they did of old; all thatremains is to pronounce the prayer properly,{23} and it is this:”So he repeated thePage 49\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Invocation to Diana.Bella dea dell’arco!Bella dea delle freccie!Della caccia e dei cani!Tu vegli colle stelle,Quando il sole va dormirTu colla luna in fronteCacci la notte meglio del di.Colle tue Ninfe al suonoDi trombe — Sei la reginaDei cacciatori — regina delle notte,Tu che sei la cacciatricePiù potente di ogni,Cacciator — ti pregoPensa un poco a noi!To Diana.Lovely Goddess of the bow!Lovely Goddess of the arrows!Of all hounds and of all huntingThou who wakest in starry heavenWhen the sun is sunk in slumberThou with moon upon they(sic) forehead,Who the chase by night preferrestUnto hunting in the daylight,With thy nymphs unto the musicOf the horn — thyself the huntress,And most powerful: I pray theeThink, although but for an instant,Upon us who pray unto thee!{24}Then Virgil taught them also the Scongiurazioneor spell to be uttered when good fortune or aught isspecially required.The Conjuration of Diana.“Bella dea del arco del cielo!Delle stelle e della luna!La regina più potenteDei cacciatori e della notte!A te ricorriamo,E chiendiamo il tuo aiutoChe tu possa darciSempre la buona fortuna!”Page 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Fair goddess of the rainbow,Of the stars and of the moon!The queen most powerfulOf hunters and the night!We beg of thee thy aid,That thou may’st give to usThe best of fortune ever!Then he added the conclusion: —“Se la nostra scongiurazioneAscolterai,E buona fortuna ci darei,Un segnale a noi lo darei!”If thou heed’st our evocationAnd wilt give good fortune to us,Then in proof give us a token!{25}And having taught them this, Virgil departed.Then the children ran to tell their parents all that had happened, and the latter impressed it on themto keep it a secret, nor breathe a word or hint thereof to any one.

But it has its proper place in this book,because it contains the invocation to and incantation of Diana, these being remarkably beautiful andoriginal. When we remember how these “hymns” have been handed down or preserved by oldwomen, and doubtless much garbled, changed, and deformed by transmission, it cannot but seemwonderful that so much classic beauty still remains in them, as, for instance, in“Lovely goddess of the bow!Lovely goddess of the arrow!Thou who walk’st in starry heaven!”Robert Browning was a great poet, but if we compare all the Italian witch-poems of and to Dianawith the former’s much-admired speech of Diana-Artemis, it will certainly be admitted by impartialcritics that the spells are fully equal to the following by the bard —“I am a goddess of the ambrosial courts,And save by Here, Queen of Pride, surpassedBy none whose temples whiten this the world:Through Heaven I roll my lucid moon along,I shed in Hell o’er my pale people peace,On Earth, I, caring for the creatures, guardEach pregnant yellow wolf and fox-bitch sleek,And every feathered mother’s callow brood,And all the(sic) love green haunts and loneliness.”Page 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"This is pretty, but it is only imitation, and neither in form or spirit really equal to the incantations,which are sincere in faith.

So he dashed after as she flitted on; but though itwas his destiny to catch, she had been fated never to be caught, and so the will of one supremegod was balanced by that of another.So the two kept flying round and round the edge of heaven, and at first all the gods roared withlaughter, but when they understood the case, they grew serious, and asked one another how it wasto end.Then the great father-god said: —“Behold the earth, which is in darkness and gloom! I will change the sister into a moon, and herbrother into a sun. And so shall she ever escape him, yet will he ever catch her with his light, whichshall fall on her from afar; for the rays of the sun are his hands, which reach forth with burninggrasp, yet which are ever eluded.”And thus it is said that this race begins anew with the first of every month, when the moon beingcold, is covered with as many coats as an onion. But while the race is being run, as the moonbecomes warm she casts off one garment after another, till she is naked and then stops, and thenwhen dressed the race begins again.As the vast storm-cloud falls in glittering drops, even so the great myths of the olden time are bro-ken up into small fairy-tales, and as these drops in turn reunite“En rivière ou sur l’estang,”(“On silent lake or streamlet lone,”)as Villon hath it, even so minor myths are again formed from the fallen waters. In this story we clear-ly have the dog made by Vulcan and the wolf — Jupiter settled the question by petrifying them — asyou may read in Julius Polluxhis fifth book, or any other on mythology.

Dianais declared to be the pro-tectress of all outcasts, those to whom the night is their day, consequently of thieves; and Laverna,as we may learn from Horace(Epistles, 16, 1) and Plautus, was preeminently the patroness of pil-fering and all rascality. In this story she also appears as a witch and humourist.It was given to me as a tradition of Virgil, who often appears as one familiar with the marvellous andhidden lore of the olden time.It happened on a time that Virgil, who knew all things hidden or magical, he who was a magicianand poet, having heard a speech (or oration) by a famous talker who had not much in him, wasasked what he thought of it? And he replied: —“It seems to me to be impossible to tell whether it was all introduction or all conclusion; certainlythere was no body in it. It was like certain fish of whom one is in doubt whether they are all head orall tail, or only head and tail; or the goddess Laverna, of whom no one ever knew whether she wasall head or all body, or neither or both.”Then the emperor inquired who this deity might be, for he had never heard of her.And Virgil replied: —“Among the gods or spirits who were of ancient times — may they be ever favourable to us! Amongthem (was) one female who was the craftiest and most knavish of them all. She was called Laverna.She was a thief, and very little known to the other deities, who were honest and dignified, for shewas rarely in heaven or in the country of the fairies.“She was almost always on earth, among thieves, pickpockets, and panders — she lived in dark-ness.“Once it happened that she went (to a mortal), a great priest in the form and guise of a very beauti-ful stately priestess (of some goddess), and said to him: —“‘You have an estate which I wish to buy. I intend to build on it a temple to (our) God. I swear to youon my body that I will pay thee within a year.’“Therefore the priest transferred to her the estate.“And very soon Lavernahad sold off all the crops, grain, cattle, wood, and poultry. There was not leftthe value of four farthings.“But on the day fixed for payment there was no Lavernato be seen. The goddess was far away, andhad left her creditor in asso— in the lurch!“At the same time Lavernawent to a great lord and bought of him a castle, well-furnished within andbroad rich lands without.Page 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"“But this time she swore on her headto pay in full in six months.“And as she had done by the priest, so she acted to the lord of the castle, and stole and sold everystick, furniture, cattle, men, and mice — there was not left wherewith to feed a fly.“Then the priest and the lord, finding out who this was, appealed to the gods, complaining that theyhad been robbed by a goddess.“And it was soon made known to them all that this was Laverna.“Therefore she was called to judgment before all the gods.“And when she was asked what she had done with the property of the priest, unto whom she hadsworn by her body to make payment at the time appointed (and why she had broken her oath)?“She replied by a strange deed which amazed them all, for she made her body disappear, so thatonly her head remained visible, and it cried: —“‘Behold me! I swore by my body, but body have I none!’“Then all the gods laughed.“After the priest came the lord who had also been tricked, and to whom she had sworn by her head.And in reply to him Lavernashowed to all present her whole body without mincing matters, and itwas one of extreme beauty, but without a head; and from the neck thereof came a voice which said:—‘Behold me, for I amLaverna, whoHave come to answer to that lord’s complaint,Who swears that I contracted debt to him,And have not paid although the time is o’er,And that I am a thief because I sworeUpon my head— but, as you all can see,I have no head at all, and therefore IAssuredly ne’er swore by such an oath.’“Then there was indeed a storm of laughter among the gods, who made the matter right by orderingthe head to join the body, and bidding Lavernapay up her debts, which she did.“Then Jovespoke and said: —“‘Here is a roguish goddess without a duty (or a worshipper), while there are in Rome innumerablethieves, sharpers, cheats, and rascals —ladri, bindolini, truffatori e scrocconi— who live by deceit.“‘These good folk have neither a church nor a god, and it is a great pity, for even the very devilshave their master, Satan, as the head of the family. Therefore, I command that in future Lavernashall be the goddess of all the knaves or dishonest tradesman, with the whole rubbish and refuse ofthe human race, who have been hitherto without a god or a devil, inasmuch as they have been toodespicable for the one or the other.’Page 57\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"“And so Lavernabecame the goddess of all dishonest and shabby people.“Whenever any one planned or intended any knavery or aught wicked, he entered her temple, andinvoked Laverna, who appeared to him as a woman’s head.

There was near Rome a temple in a grove where robbers went to divide theirplunder. There was a statue of the goddess. Her image, according to some, was a head without abody; according to others, a body without a head; but the epithet of ‘beautiful’ applied to her byHorace indicates that she who gave disguises to her worshippers had kept one to herself.” She wasworshipped in perfect silence. This is confirmed by a passage to Horace (Epist. 16, lib. 1), where animpostor, hardly daring to move his lips, repeats the following prayer or incantation: —“O Goddess Laverna!Give me the art of cheating and deceiving,Of making men believe that I am just,Holy, and innocent! extend all darknessAnd deep obscurity o’er my misdeeds!”It is interesting to compare this unquestionably ancient classic invocation to Lavernawith the onewhich is before given. The goddess was extensively known to the lower orders, and in Plautus acook who has been robbed of his implements calls on her to revenge him.I call special attention to the fact that in this, as in a great number of Italian witch-incantations, thedeity or spirit who is worshipped, be it Dianaherself or Laverna, is threatenedwith torment by ahigher power until he or she grants the favour demanded. This is quite classic, i.e., Graeco-Romanor Oriental, in all of which sources the magician relies not on favour, aid, or power granted by eitherGod or Satan, but simply on what he has been able to wrench and wring, as it were, out of infinitenature or the primal source by penance and study. I mention this because a reviewer hasreproached me with exaggerating the degree to which diabolism— introduced by the Church since1500 — is deficient in Italy. But in fact, among the higher class of witches, or in their traditions, it ishardly to be found at all. In Christian diabolism the witch never dares to threaten Satan or God, orany of the Trinity or angels, for the whole system is based on the conception of a Church and ofobedience.The herb concordia probably takes its name from that of the goddess Concordia, who was repre-sented as holding a branch. It plays a great part in witchcraft, after verbena and rue.Page 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"APPENDIX.Comments on the Foregoing Texts.So long ago as the year 1886 I learned that there was in existence a manuscript setting forth thedoctrines of Italian witchcraft, and I was promised that, if possible, it should be obtained for me. Inthis I was for a time disappointed. But having urged it on Maddalena, my collector of folk-lore, whileshe was leading a wandering life in Tuscany, to make an effort to obtain or recover something of thekind, I at last received from her, on January 1, 1897, entitled Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches.Now be it observed, that every leading point which forms the plot or centre of the Vangel, such asthat Dianais Queen of the Witches; an associate of Herodias(Aradia) in her relations to sorcery;that she bore a child to her brother the Sun (here Lucifer); that as a moon-goddess she is in somerelation to Cain, who dwells as prisoner in the moon, and that the witches of old were peopleoppressed by feudal lands(sic), the former revenging themselves in every way, and holding orgies toDianawhich the Church represented as being the worship of Satan — all of this, I repeat, had beentold or written out for me in fragments by Maddalena (not to speak of other authorities), even as ithad been chronicled by Horst or Michelet; therefore all this is in the present document of minorimportance. All of this I expected, but what I did not expect, and what was new to me, was that por-tion which is given as prose-poetry and which I have renderedin metre or verse. This being tradi-tional, and taken down from wizards, is extremely curious and interesting, since in it are preservedmany relics of lore which, as may be verified from records, have come down from days of yore.Aradiais evidently enough Herodias, who was regarded in the beginning as associated with Dianaas chief of the witches. This was not, as I opine, derived from the Herodiasof the New Testament,but from an earlier replica of Lilith, bearing the same name. It is, in fact, an identification or twin-ingof the Aryan and Shemitic Queens of Heaven, or of Night and of Sorcery, and it may be that this wasknown to the earliest myth-makers. So far back as the sixth century the worship of HerodiasandDianaby witches was condemned by a Church Council at Ancyra. Pipernus and other writers havenoted the evident identity of Herodiaswith Lilith. Isispreceded both.Dianais very vigorously, even dramatically, set forth in this poem as the goddess of the god-forsak-en and ungodly, of thieves, harlots, and, truthfully enough, of the “minions of the moon,” as Falstaffwould have fain had them called. It was recognised in ancient Rome, as it is in modern India, that nohuman being canbe so bad or vile as to have forfeited all right to divine protection of some kind orother, and Dianawas this protectress. It my be as well to observe here, that among all free-thinkingphilosophers, educated parias, and literary or book-Bohemians, there has ever been a mostunorthodox tendency to believe that the faults and errors of humanity are more due (if not altogetherdue) to unavoidable causes which we cannot help, as, for instance, heredity, the being born sav-ages, or poor, or in vice, or unto “bigotry and virtue” in excess, or unto inquisitioning — that is to say,when we are so overburdened with innately born sin that all our free will cannot set us free fromit.{31}It was during the so-called Dark Ages, or from the downfall of the Roman Empire until the thirteenthcentury, that the belief that all which was worst in man owed its origin solely to the monstrous abus-es and tyranny of Church and State. For then, at every turn in life, the vast majority encountereddownright shameless, palpable iniquity and injustice, with no law for the weak who were withoutpatrons.Page 61\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The perception of this drove vast numbers of the discontented into rebellion, and as they could notprevail by open warfare, they took their hatred out in a form of secret anarchy, which was, however,intimately blended with superstition and fragments of old tradition. Prominent in this, and naturallyenough, was the worship of Dianathe protectress — for the alleged adoration of Satan was a farlater invention of the Church, and it has never really found a leading place in Italian witchcraft to thisday. That is to say, purely diabolicalwitchcraft did not find general acceptance till the end of the fif-teenth century, when it was, one may almost say, invented in Rome to supply means wherewith todestroy the threatening heresy of Germany.The growth of Sentiment is the increase of suffering; man is never entirely miserable until he findsout how wronged he is and fancies that he sees far ahead a possible freedom. In ancient times menas slaves suffered less under even more abuse, because they believed they were born to low condi-tions of life. Even the best reform brings pain with it, and the great awakening of man was accompa-nied with griefs, many of which even yet endure. Pessimism is the result of too much culture andintroversion.It appears to be strangely out of sight and out of mind with all historians, that the sufferings of thevast majority of mankind, or the enslaved and poor, were far greater under early Christianity, or tillthe end of the Middle Ages and the Emancipation of Serfs, than they were before. The reason forthis was that in the old “heathen” time the humble did not know, or even dream, that all are equalbefore God, or that they had many rights, even here on earth, as slaves; for, in fact, the whole moraltendency of the New Testament is utterly opposed to slavery, or even severe servitude. Every worduttered teaching Christ’s mercy and love, humility and charity, was, in fact, a bitter reproof, not onlyto every lord in the land, but to the Church itself, and its arrogant prelates. The fact that many abus-es had been mitigated and that there were benevolent saints, does not affect the fact that, on thewhole, mankind was for a long time worse off than before, and the greatest cause of this sufferingwas what may be called a sentimental one, or a newly-born consciousness of rights withheld, whichis always of itself a torture. And this was greatly aggravated by the endless preaching to the peoplethat it was a dutyto suffer and endure oppression and tyranny, and that the rights of Authority of allkinds were so great that they on the whole even excused their worst abuses. For by upholdingAuthority in the nobility the Church maintained its own.The result of it all was a vast development of rebels, outcasts, and all the discontented, who adopt-ed witchcraft or sorcery for a religion, and wizards as their priests. They had secret meetings indesert places, among old ruins accursed by priests as the haunt of evil spirits or ancient heathengods, or in the mountains. To this day the dweller in Italy may often find secluded spots environed byancient chestnut forests, rocks, and walls, which suggest fit places for the Sabbat, and are some-times still believed by tradition to be such. And I also believe that in this Gospel of the Witches wehave a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at these meetings. They adoredforbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds, inspired as much by rebellion against Society as bytheir own passions.There is, however, in the Evangel of the Witches an effort made to distinguish between the naturallywicked or corrupt and those who are outcasts or oppressed, as appears from the passage: —“Yet like Cain’s daughter (offspring) thou shalt never be,Nor like the race who have become at lastWicked and infamous from suffering,As are the Jews and wandering Zingari,Who are allthieves: like then ye shall /not/ be.”Page 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The supper of the Witches, the cakes of meal, salt, and honey, in the form of crescent moons, areknown to every classical scholar. The moon or horn-shaped cakes are still common. I have eaten ofthem this very day, and though they are known all over the world, I believe they owe their fashion totradition.In the conjuration of the meal there is a very curious tradition introduced to the effect that the spigeor glittering grains of wheat from which spikes shoot like sun-rays, owe their brilliant likeness to aresemblance to the fire-fly, “who comes to give the light.” We have, I doubt not, in this a classic tradi-tion, but I cannot verify it. Hereupon the Vangelocites a common nursery-rhyme, which may also befound in a nursery-tale, yet which, like others, is derived from witch-lore, by which the lucciolais putunder a glass and conjured to give by its light certain answers.The conjuration of the meal or bread, as being literally our body as contributing to form it, anddeeply sacred because it had lain in the earth, where dark and wondrous secrets bide, seems tocast a new light on the Christian sacrament. It is a type of resurrection from the earth, and wastherefore used at the Mysteries and Holy Supper, and the grain had pertained to chthonicsecrets, orto what had been under the earth in darkness. Thus even earth-worms are invoked in modern witch-craft as familiar with dark mysteries, and the shepherd’s pipe to win the Orphic power must beburied three days in the earth. And so all was, and is, in sorcery a kind of wild poetry based on sym-bols, all blending into one another, light and darkness, fire-flies and grain, life and death.Very strange indeed, but very strictly according to ancient magic as described by classic authorities,is the threatening Diana, in case she will not grant a prayer. This recurs continually in the witch-exor-cisms or spells. The magus, or witch, worships the spirit, but claims to have the right, drawn from ahigher power, to compeleven the Queen of Earth, Heaven, and Hell to grant the request. “Give mewhat I ask, and thou shalt have honour and offerings; refuse, and I will vex thee by insult.” SoCanidia and her kind boasted that they could compelthe gods to appear. This is all classic. No oneever heard of a Satanic witch invoking or threatening the Trinity, or Christ or even the angels orsaints. In fact, they cannot even compelthe devil or his imps to obey — they work entirely by hisgood-will as slaves. But in the old Italian lore the sorcerer or witch is all or nothing, and aims at limit-less will or power.Of the ancient belief in the virtues of a perforated stone I need not speak. But it is to be remarkedthat in the invocation the witch goes forth in the earliest morning to seekfor verbena or verbain. Theancient Persian magi, or rather their daughters, worshipped the sun as it rose by waving freshlyplucked verbena,{32} which was one of the seven most powerful plants in magic. These Persianpriestesses were naked while they thus worshipped, nudity being a symbol of truth and sincerity.The extinguishing the lights, nakedness, and the orgie, were regarded as symbolical of the bodybeing laid in the ground, the grain being planted, or of entering into darkness and death, to berevived in new forms, or regeneration and light. It was the laying aside of daily life.Page 63\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Gospel of the Witches, as I have given it, is in reality only the initial chapter of the collection ofceremonies, “cantrips,” incantations, and traditions current in the fraternity or sisterhood, the wholeof which are in the main to be found in my Etruscan Roman Remainsand Florentine Legends. Ihave, it is true, a great number as yet unpublished, and there are more ungathered, but the wholescripture of this sorcery, all its principal tenets, formulas, medicaments, and mysteries may be foundin what I have collected and printed. Yet I would urge that it would be worth while to arrange andedit it all into one work, because it would be to every student of archaeology, folk-lore, or history ofgreat value. It has been the faith of millions in the past it has made itself felt in innumerable tradi-tions, which deserve to be better understood than they are, and I would gladly undertake the work ifI believed that the public would make it worth the publisher’s outlay and pains.It may be observed with truth that I have not treated this Gospel, nor even the subject of witchcraft,entirely as folk-lore, as the word is strictly defined and carried out; that is, as a mere traditional factor thing to be chiefly regarded as a variant like or unlike sundry other traditions, or to be tabulatedand put away in pigeon-holes for reference. That it is useful and sensible to do all this is perfectlytrue, and it has led to an immense amount of valuable search, collection, and preservation. Butthere is this to be said — and I have observed that here and there a few genial minds are beginningto awake to it — that the mere study of the letter in this way has developed a great indifference tothe spirit, going in many cases so far as to produce, like Realism in Art (to which it is allied), even acontempt for the matter or meaning of it, as originally believed in.I was lately much struck by the fact that in a very learned work on Music, the author, in discussingthat of ancient times and of the East, while extremely accurate and minute in determining pentatonicand all other scales, and what may be called the mere machinery and history of composition,showed that he was utterly ignorant of the fundamental fact that notes and chords, bars andmelodies, were in themselves ideasor thoughts. Thus Confuciusis said to have composed amelody which was a personal description of himself. Now if this be not understood, we cannotunderstand the soul of early music, and the folk-lorist who cannot get beyond the letter and fancieshimself “scientific” is exactly like the musician who has no idea of how or why melodies wereanciently composed.The strange and mystical chapter “How Diana made the Stars and the Rain” is the same given inmy Legends of Florence, vol. ii. p. 229, but much enlarged, or developed to a cosmogonic-mytholog-ic sketch. And here a reflection occurs which is perhaps the most remarkable which all this WitchEvangel suggests. In all other Scriptures of all races, it is the male, Jehovah, Buddha, or Brahma,who creates the universe; in Witch Sorcery it is the female who is the primitive principle. Wheneverin history there is a period of radical intellectual rebellion against long-established conservatism,hierarchy, and the like, there is always an effort to regard Woman as the fully equal, which meansthe superior sex. Thus in the extraordinary war of conflicting elements, strange schools of sorcery,Neo-Platonism, Cabala, Heretic Christianity, Gnosticism, Persian Magism and Dualism, with theremains of old Greek and Egyptian theologies in the third and fourth centuries at Alexandria, and inthe House of Light of Cairo in the ninth, the equality of Woman was a prominent doctrine. It wasSophia or Helena, the enfranchised, who was then the true Christ who was to save mankind.Page 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"When Illumination or Illuminé-ism, in company with magic and mysticism, and a resolve to regener-ate society according to extreme free thought, inspired the Templars to the hope that they wouldmaster the Church and the world, the equality of Woman, derived from the Cairene traditions, againreceived attention. And it may be observed that during the Middle Ages, and even so late as theintense excitements which inspired the French Huguenots, the Jansenists and the Anabaptists,Woman always came forth more prominently or played a far greater part than she had done in socialor political life. This was also the case in the Spiritualism founded by the Fox sisters of Rochester,New York, and it is manifesting itself in many ways in the Fin de Siècle, which is also a nervouschaos according to Nordau, — Woman being evidently a fish who shows herself most when thewaters are troubled: —“Oh, Woman, in our hours of ease!”The reader will remember the rest, but we should also remember that in the earlier ages the vastmajority of mankind itself, suppressed by the too great or greatly abused power of Church andState, only manifested itself at such periods of rebellion against forms or ideas grown old. And withevery new rebellion, every fresh outburst or debâcle, or wild inundation and bursting over the barri-ers, humanity and woman gain something, that is to say, their just dues or rights. For as everyfreshet spreads more widely its waters over the fields, which are in due time the more fertilisedthereby, so the world at large gains by every Revolution, however terrible or repugnant it may be fora time.The Emancipated or Woman’s Rights woman, when too enthusiastic, generally considers man aslimited, while Woman is destined to gain on him. In earlier ages a contrary opinion prevailed, andboth are, or were, apparently in the wrong, so far as the future is concerned. For in truth both sexesare progressive, and progress in this respect means not a conflictof the male and female principle,such as formed the basis of the Mahabarata, but a gradual ascertaining of true ability and adjust-ment of relations or co-ordination of powers — in doing which on a scientific basis all conflict ceas-es.These remarks are appropriate to my text and subject, because it is in studying the epochs whenwoman has made herself prominent and influential that we learn what the capacities of the femalesex truly are. Among these, that of Witchcraft as it truly was — not as it is generally quite misunder-stood — is as deeply interesting as any other. For the Witch— laying aside all question as to magicor its non-existence — was once a real factor or great power in rebellious social life, and to this veryday — as most novels bear witness — it is recognised that there is something uncanny, mysterious,and incomprehensible in woman, which neither she herself nor man can explain.“For every woman is at heart a witch.”We have banished the broom and the cat and the working miracles, the Sabbat and pacts withSatan, but the mystery or puzzle is as great as ever; no one living knows to what it is destined tolead. Are not the charms of love of every kind, and the enjoyment of beauty in all its forms in nature,mysteries, miracles, or magical?Page 65\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"To all who are interested in this subject of woman’s influence and capacity, this Evangel of theWitches will be of value as showing that there have been strange thinkers who regarded creation asa feminine development or parthenogenesis from which the masculine principle was born. Lucifer, orLight, lay hidden in the darkness of Diana, as heat is hidden in ice. But the regenerator or Messiahof this strange doctrine is a woman — Aradia, though the two, mother and daughter, are confused orreflected in the different tales, even as Jahvehis confused with the Elohim.“Remains to be said” — that the Adam-nable and Eve-il, or Adamite assemblages enjoined in theGospel of Sorcery, are not much, if at all, kept up by the now few and far between old or youngwitches and venerable wizards of the present day. That is to say, not to my knowledge in Central orNorthern Italy. But among the roués, viveurs, and fast women of Florence and Milan — where theyare not quite as rare as eclipses — such assemblies are called balli angelicior angels’ balls. Theyare indeed far from being unknown in any of the great cities of the world. A few years ago a Sundaynewspaper in an American city publshed a detailed account of them in the “dance-houses” of thetown, declaring that they were of very frequent occurrence, which was further verified to me by menfamiliar with them.A very important point to all who regard the finds or discoveries of ancient tradition as of importance,is that a deep and extensive study of the Italian witch-traditions which I have collected, a compari-son of them one with the other, and of the whole with what resembles it in the writings of Ovid andother mythologists, force the conviction (which I have often expressed, but not too frequently) thatthere are in these later records many very valuable and curious remains of ancient Latin or Etruscanlore, in all probability entire poems, tales, and invocations which have passed over from the ancienttongue. If this be true, and when it shall come to pass that scholars will read with interest what ishere given, then most assuredly there will be critical examination and verification of what is ancientin it, and it will be discovered what marvels of tradition still endure.That the witches even yet form a fragmentary secret society or sect, that they call it that of the OldReligion, and that there are in the Romagna entire villages in which the people are completely hea-then, and almost entirely governed by Settimani or “seven months’ children,” may be read in thenovel of the name, as well as several papers published in divers magazines, or accepted from myown personal knowledge. The existence of a religionsupposes a Scripture, and in this case it maybe admitted, almost without severe verification, that the Evangel of the Witches is really a very oldwork. Thus it is often evident that where a tradition has been taken down from verbal delivery, theold woman repeats words or sentences by whole chapters which she does not fully understand, buthas heard and learned. These are to be verified by correlation or comparison with other tales andtexts. Now considering all this most carefully and critically, or severely yet impartially, no one canresist the conviction that in the Gospel of the Witches we have a book which is in all probability thetranslation of some early or later Latin work, since it seems most probable that every fixed faith findsits record. There are literary men among the Pariahs of India; there were probably many among theminions of the moon, or nocturnal worshippers ofDiana. In fact, I am not without hope that researchmay yet reveal in the writings of some long-forgotten heretic or mystic of the dark ages the parallelof many passages in this text, if not the whole of it.Page 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Yet a few years, reader, and all this will have vanished from among the Italians before the newspa-per and railroad, even as a light cloud is driven before a gale, or pass away like a snowflakes in apond. Old traditions are, in fact, disappearing with such incredible rapidity that I am assured on bestauthority — and can indeed see for myself — that what I collected or had recorded for me ten yearsago in the Romagna Toscana, with exceptionably skilful aid, could not now be gathered at all byanybody, since it no longer exists, save in the memories of a few old sorcerers who are daily disap-pearing, leaving no trace behind. It is going — going — it is all but gone; in fact, I often think that,old as I am (and I am twelve years beyond the limit of extreme old age as defined by the Duke ofMarlborough in his defence), I shall yet live to hear the rap of the auctioneer Time as he bids off thelast real Latin sorcerer to Death! It may be that he is passing in his checks even as I write. Thewomen or witches, having more vitality, will last a little longer — I mean the traditional kind, for asregards innate natural development of witchcraft and pure custom, we shall always have with us sor-ceresses, even as we shall have the poor — until we all go up together.What is very remarkable, even to the being difficult to understand, is the fact that so much antiquetradition survived with so little change among the peasantry. But legends and spells in families ofhereditary witches are far more likely to live than fashions in art, yet even the latter have been keptsince 2000 years. Thus, as E. Neville Rolfe writes: “The late Signor Castellani, who was the first toreproduce with fidelity the jewellery found in the tombs of Etruria and Greece, made up his mind thatsome survival of this ancient and exquisite trade must still exist somewhere in Italy. He accordinlymade diligent search... and in an out of the way village discovered goldsmiths who made ornamentsfor the peasants, which in their character indicated a strong survival of early Etruscan art.”{33}And here I would remark, that where I have written perhaps a little too bitterly of the indifference ofscholars to the curious traditions preserved by wizards and witches, I refer to Rome, and especiallyto Northern Italy. G. Pitrédid all that was possible for one man as regards the South. Since the fore-going chapters were written, I received Naples in the Nineties, by E. Neville Rolfe, B.A., in which adeep and intelligent interest in the subject is well supported by extensive knowledge. What will be tothe reader of my book particularly interesting is the amount of information which Mr. Rolfe givesregarding the connection of Dianawith witchcraft, and how many of her attributes became those ofthe Madonna. “The worship of Diana,” as he says, “prevailed very extensively... so much so, thatwhen Christianity superseded Paganism, much of the heathen symbolism was adapted to the newrites, and the transition from the worship of Diana to that of the Madonna was made comparativelysimple.” Mr. Rolfe speaks of the key, rue, and verbena as symbols of Diana; of all of these I haveincantations, apparently very ancient, and identified with Diana. I have often found ruein houses inFlorence, and had it given to me as a special favour. It is always concealed in some dark corner,because to take any away is to take luck. The bronze frog was an emblem of Diana; hence the Latinproverb, “He who loves a frog regards it as Diana.” It was made till recent times as an amulet. Ihave one as a paper-weight now before me. There is also an incantation to the frog.That wherein Mr. Rolfe tacitly and unconsciously confirms what I have written, and what is mostremarkable in this my own work, is that the wizards in Italy form a distinct class, still exercising greatpower in Naples and Sicily, and even possessing very curious magical documents and cabalisticcharts, one of which (familiar to those who have seen it among the Takruri and Arab sorcerers inCairo, in their books) he gives. These probably are derived from Malta. Therefore it will not seemastonishing to the reader that this Gospel of the Witches should have been preserved, even as Ihave given it.

It is evidently fullof old Latin mythologic lore of a very marked character. The whole of it may be found in a forthcom-ing work by the writer of the book, entitled “The Unpublished Legends of Virgil.” London, Elliot Stock.Diana as Giving Beauty and Restoring Strength.Diana hath power to do all things, to give glory to the lowly, wealth to the poor, joy to the afflicted,beauty to the ugly. Be not in grief, if you are her follower; though you be in prison and in darkness,she will bring light: many there are whom she sinks that they may rise the higher.There was of old in Monteroni a young man so ugly that when a stranger was passing through thetown he was shown this Gianni, for such was his name, as one of the sights of the place. Yet,hideous as he was, because he was rich, though of no family, he had confidence, and hoped boldlyto win and wed some beautiful young lady of rank.Now there came to dwell in Monteroni a wonderfully beautiful biondina, or blonde young lady of cul-ture and condition, to whom Gianni, with his usual impudence, boldly made love, getting, as wasalso usual, a round No for his reply.But this time, being more than usually fascinated in good truth, for there were influences at work heknew not of, he became as one possessed or mad with passion, so that he hung about the lady’shouse by night and day, seeking indeed an opportunity to rush in and seize her, or by some desper-ate trick to master and bear her away.But here his plans were defeated, because the lady had ever by her a great cat which seemed to beof more than human intelligence, and, whenever Gianni approached her or her home, it alwaysespied him and gave the alarm with a terrible noise. And there was indeed something so unearthlyin its appearance, and something so awful in its great green eyes which shone like torches, that theboldest man might have been appalled by them.But one evening Gianni reflected that it was foolish to be afraid of a mere cat, which need only scarea boy, and so he boldly ventured on an attack. So going forth, he took a ladder, which he carriedand placed against the lady’s window. But while he stood at the foot, he found by him an oldwoman, who earnestly began to beg him not to persevere in his intention. “For thou knowest well,Gianni,” she said, “that the lady will have none of thee; thou art a terror to her. Do but go home andlook in the glass, and it will seem to thee that thou art looking on a mortal sin in human form.”Then Gianni in a roaring rage cried, “I will have my way and my will, thou old wife of the devil, if Imust kill thee and the girl too!” Saying which, he rushed up the ladder; but before he had opened orcould enter the window, and was at the top, he found himself as it were turned to wood or stone,unable to move.Page 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Then he was overwhelmed with shame, and said, “Ere long the whole town will be here to witnessmy defeat. However, I will make one last appeal.” So he cried: —“Oh, vecchia! thou who didst mean me more kindly than I knew, pardon me, I beg thee, and rescueme from this trouble! And if, as I well ween, thou art a witch, and if I, by becoming a wizard, may befreed from my trials and troubles, then I pray thee teach me how it may be done, so that I may winthe young lady, since I now see that she is of thy kind, and that I must be of it to be worthy of her.”Then Gianni saw the old woman sweep like a flash of light from a lantern up from the ground, and,touching him, bore him away from the ladder, when lo! the light was a cat, who had been anon thewitch, and she said: —“Thou wilt soon set forth on a long journey, and in thy way wilt find a wretched worn-out horse, whenthou must say: —“‘Fata Diana!

So he married his beautiful lady, and all lived the hidden lifeof witches and wizards from that day, and are now in Fairy Land.Note.As a curious illustration of the fact that the faith in Diana and the other deities of the Roman mythol-ogy, as connected with divination, still survives among the Italians of “the people,” I may mentionthat after this work went to press, I purchased for two soldi or one penny, a small chapbook in whichit is shown how, by a process of conjuration or evocation and numbers, not only Diana, but thirty-nine other deities may be made to give answers to certain questions.

The world would fall intothe belief that these constituted all the works of the kind which had ever existed, when, in fact, theyform only a small part of the whole. And folklore was unknown to classic authors: there is really noevidence in any ancient Latin writer that he gathered traditions and the like among the vulgar, asmen collect at present.

But such a stone is called holy on shipboard, and here it hasreally a claim to the name.{10} This is an obscure passage, but I believe that I have given it as the poet meant or felt it.{11} Il sasso a palla.Chapter V.{12} This passage is not given in the original MS., but it is necessary to clearly explain what followsabruptly.Page 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"{13} This appears from very early ages, as in Roman times, to have been regarded as gifted withmagic properties, and was used in occult ceremonies.{14} That is, Dianais invoked to send demons with the very life of the fire of hell to still moreincrease that of the sun to intensify the wine.Chapter VI.{15} The beginning of this spell seems to be merely a prose introduction explaining the nature of theceremony.Chapter VII.{16} This refers to a small ceremony which I have seen performed scores of times, and have indeedhad it performed over me almost as often, as an act of courtesy common among wizards and witch-es. It consists of making certain signs and crosses over a few drops of oil and the head of the oneblessed, accompanied by a short incantation. I have had the ceremony seriously commended orprescribed to me as a means of keeping in good health and prosperity.Chapter VIII.{17} Kreussler, Sorbenwendische Altherthümer, Pt. 1. p. 272.Chapter IX.{18} According to all evil witchcraft in the world — especially among the black Voodoos —any individual can be injured or killed if the magician can obtain any portion of the person, howeversmall, especially a lock of hair. This is specially described in Thiodolf the Islander, a romance by LaMotte Fouqué. The exchange of locks by lovers is possibly connected with magic.{19} Marroni d’ India.

Hence the apparently prose form of mostspells.{24} It is to be observed that the invocation is strictly a psalm of praise or a hymn; thescongiu-razioneis a request or prayer, though it often takes the form of a threat or menace. This only existsin classic witchcraft.{25} Something is here omitted, which can, however, be supplied from many other similar incanta-tions. It was probably as follows: —If thou art favourableAnd grant my prayer,Then may I hearThe bark of a dog,The neigh of a horse,The croaking of a frog,The chirp of a bird,The song of a cricket,et caetera.Three or four of these sounds were generally selected. They vary more or less, but seldom material-ly, from these. Sometimes visible manifestations, as, for instance, lightning, are requested. To see awhite horse is a sign that the prayer will be granted after some delay. It also signifies victory.{26} “La testa d’un uomo piena di verme e puzzolente.” A parody in kind for the decayed cabbage,much completer than the end of the German tale resembling it.Chapter XIV.{no footnotes)Chapter XV.{27} This was a very peculiar characteristic of Diana, who was involved in a similar manner. I havehere omitted much needless verbiage or reputation in the original MS. and also abbreviated whatfollows.{28} All of this indicates unmistakably, in several repects, a genuine tradition. In the hands of craftypriests this would prove a great aid to popularity.{29} I conjecture that this is wild poppy. The poppy was specially sacred to Ceres, but also to theNight and its rites, and Laverna was a nocturnal deity — a play on the word paura, or fear.Page 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"{30} This passage recalls strangely enough the worship of the Graeco-Roman goddess PavororFear, the attendant on Mars.

Signore Castellani said that he had read of these Chinese vases, and always regardedthe story as a fable or impossible, but that they could be made perfectly by my process, adding,however, that they would cost too much to make it profitable.
