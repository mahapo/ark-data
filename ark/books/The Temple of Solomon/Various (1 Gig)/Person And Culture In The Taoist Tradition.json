[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"PERSON AND CULTURE IN THE TAOIST TRADITIONRussell Kirkland Specialists in the study of Chinese religion have spilled much ink over the issue of what\"Taoism\" is. To some, it is simply a convenient rubric for discussing common concepts in Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, and related literature. In H. G. Creel's more restrictive usage, \"true Taoism\" isrepresented only by those \"pure\" elements of speculative philosophy found in Chuang-tzu alone.iTo some more recent scholars, such as Michel Strickmann, the term \"Taoism\" properly refers tothe socially definable religious tradition that had common roots in the second-century movementestablished by Chang Tao-ling.ii In the last decade or two, as an increasing number of Westernscholars have devoted themselves to Taoist research, several have also turned their attention tothe definitional question of what, precisely, \"Taoism\" is.iii I shall forego the temptation tocatalogue the results here, but what seems to emerge from the deliberations of many specialists isa general consensus that \"Taoism\" is (or at least once was) a single, if highly diverse, culturalsystem. What, then, are we to make of the time-honored chestnut that there were actually two\"Taoisms\" -- the ancient philosophical school represented by Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu, and a laterreligious tradition, which may or may not have had much in common with the former? Virtuallyevery student of Chinee thought or religion has been acquainted with the notion that thatdistinction of tao-chia from tao-chiao is one that \"the Chinese make themselves.\" In theformulation of Fung Yu-lan, for instance:there is a distinction between Taoism as a philosophy...and the Taoistreligion....Their teachings are not only different; they are even contradictory."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Taoism as a philosophy teaches the doctrine of following nature, while Taoismas a religion teaches the doctrine of working against nature.ivSuch ideas -- like those of H. G. Creel -- have been echoed widely in Western scholarship,irrespective of their inherent validity. This is not the place for a comprehensive critique of sucha position. I shall merely suggest that, in terms of our present knowledge of the Taoist tradition,it seems unlikely that either Fung or Creel have much, if anything, to contribute, for the simplereason that neither seems ever to have given any serious attention to post-classical Taoism.Neither, for instance, gives much evidence of ever having browsed through the contents of theTao-tsang. Creel even bases his statements about \"hsien Taoism\" almost exclusively upon thequite peripheral figure of Ko Hung -- the Confucian would-be alchemist who wrote the earlyfourth-century set of essays known collectively as the Pao-p'u-tzu.vProfessor Laurence Thompson, who has addressed many issues in the study of Chinesereligion over the years, recently weighed in with some of his own reflections on scholars' attemptto define \"Taoism.\"vi The present essay is intended as a contribution to the continuing effort ofscholars like Professor Thompson to help refine our analytical and interpretive frameworks forthe study of Chinese religion. I certainly do not pretend to have resolved all the pertinentinterpretive problems; indeed, I shall not even attempt to mention them all. Rather, my goal hereis to enrich the debate over what Taoism is by posing some provocative questions, and offeringsome provocative thoughts. More specifically, I wish to examine some of the culturalassumptions that seem to underlie the insistence of many modern minds upon maintaining acategorical distinction between \"philosophical Taoism\" and \"religious Taoism.\" In this effort, Ishall draw attention to certain unexamined cultural and intellectual values that seem to prevailamong intellectuals of modern China and the West alike. Our ability to understand other culturesaccurately (or even, perhaps, our own) may well be tied to our ability to recognize suchprejudices -- our own patterns of making sense of things and determining their value on the basisof axiomatic (i.e., unexamined) assumptions about what is true, valid, or even worthy of our"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"attention. Such values, I propose, need to be examined in light of specific historical realitieswithin each culture. I do not contend that such \"biases\" are inherently in conflict with reality,but merely that we need to be fully aware of our own values, and alert to the possibility that theintellectual and religious values at work within our own culture (whether Chinese or Western)might at times color or even distort our efforts to make sense of a cultural tradition like Taoism.Similar questions can of course be raised in relation to Japanese understandings of Taoism, someof which have recently been surveyed by Professor Thompson.vii But at present I shall restrictmy discussion to the Sino-Western academic milieu, within which Taoism is studied and taughtin much of the world.What I wish to propose is that the common distinction of \"philosophical Taoism\" and\"religious Taoism\" ultimately reflects specific cultural prejudices current among intellectuals inlate imperial China and the modern West. Naturally, it is not possible to detail here thepertinent intellectual history in each culture completely. For the moment, I shall merely suggestthat there are quite clear cultural explanations for attitudes such as those of H. G. Creel and FungYu-lan. What they, and many other modern interpreters, seem to project is a sort of generic\"protestant\" attitude, an attitude that generally abhors ritual and virtually every form of socialreligious activity, and esteems instead an individualistic striving for a more abstract spiritualexaltation. The position of modern Chinese intellectuals like Fung Yu-lan, I suggest, reflectsspecific fears and concerns of their Confucian forebears in late imperial China (a point to which Ishall return below). Meanwhile, Western interpreters like Creel are heir to a post- Reformationsensibility that identifies the locus of virtually all legitimate values -- moral, social, or religious -- within the isolated individual.Cult or Cultivation?Some of the recent scholarship of Gregory Schopen has demonstrated rather convincinglythat 19th- and 20th-century Western scholarship on Indian Buddhism has often been marked by"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"assumptions that reflect the dominant Protestant values of the modern West.viii The pertinenceof such considerations to the study of Chinese thought and religion seems to be brought home bya book published a few years ago by Rodney Taylor. That work, entitled The Way of Heaven:An Introduction to the Confucian Religious Life, was issued within a series entitled TheIconography of Religions.ix Each volume of that series featured illustrations of actual religiouspractice in different traditions, with a brief introductory text outlining the nature of the traditionin question. Taylor's introduction reiterates his fundamental thesis that Confucianism should beconsidered a \"religion\" on the grounds that its ultimate goal is the attainment of sagehood. Ishall not pass judgment upon that thesis here. Rather, I would like to stress is that it seems ironicthat the photographs that Taylor presents to illustrate Confucian religious life seem to have littleto do with the individual search for \"sagehood\": they are devoted almost exclusively toillustrating rituals being performed by priests in Confucian temples. Such a contrast strikeshome very deeply for a student of Taoism. It would seem that the same question holds forConfucianism and for Taoism alike: To what extent is the tradition devoted to individualcultivation -- to the search for \"sagehood\" -- and to what extent is the tradition a \"religion\" in asense closer to that which scholars like Melford Spiro or Clifford Geertz have suggested -- acultural system of rituals and symbols designed to allow interaction with real or purported beingswho pertain to a higher order of existence?xA generation of students have learned Chinese religion from Professor Thompson's text,The Chinese Way in Religion.xi Those students have all read the \"Sacrificial Hymn toConfucius,\" in some versions of which, at least, Confucius is apparently represented as a divinitywho is not only co-equal with Heaven and Earth, but also the \"ruler of living beings andthings.\"xii Now, it is well known that \"Lao-tzu\" (though likely an invented figure himself)became the subject of imperial sacrifices in Han times as well. Yet, those in Chinese historywho have understood \"Lao-tzu\" as a divinity have, in modern times, been identified asrepresentatives of \"the tao-chiao,\" which, Fung and Creel insist, must be sharply distinguishedfrom \"the tao-chia.\" Yet, no one, to my knowledge, has insisted upon an analogous bifurcation"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"within Confucianism. Would it not seem appropriate to attempt to interpret both traditionswithin more or less the same terms, seeking shared patterns that might reveal common andenduring elements of Chinese religion and culture?While the pursuit of such grand questions seems quite fruitful, I shall restrict my focushere to Taoism, and address myself to a single, if complex, question: To what extent is Taoism amatter of \"cultivation\" -- an individual pursuit of self-perfection (or \"sagehood,\" if you will) --and to what extent does it involve real or purported beings who pertain to a higher order ofexistence. Or, to put the matter in the simplest terms, what is the relationship of \"cult\" and\"cultivation\" in the Taoist tradition?At first glance, it might seem that such an undertaking constitutes no more than anexercise in comparing and contrasting the so-called \"philosophical\" and \"religious\" forms ofTaoism. But the more one becomes acquainted with the historical and textual realities of theTaoist tradition, the less tenable such a bifurcation seems to become. Let us, for presentpurposes, suggest that we delimit the Taoist tradition in terms of (1) the various texts preservedin the Tao-tsang and (2) those individuals and groups who composed, preserved, and used thosetexts. Such a delimitation (inspired, in part, by certain suggestions of Michel Strickmann)nonetheless leaves us with a fairly amorphous subject for study, for the Tao-tsang contains aplethora of material pertaining to both \"cult\" and \"cultivation.\" One finds in the collection anabundance of materials pertaining to ritual and meditative communion with higher powers, aswell as the full range of classical Taoist philosophical works and an extensive collection ofpertinent commentaries. Furthermore, historical and biographical texts of, say, the T'ang dynastyonward demonstrate that the concepts and values first encountered in Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzuremain quite central to the thought and speech of members of the later religious tradition.xiiiMoreover, we find the central concern of individual self-perfection flourishing in later Taoism,both in the meditational systems of Six Dynasties Shang-ch'ing Taoism and of T'ang masters likeSsu-ma Ch'eng-chen, as well as in the so-called \"Inner Alchemy\" of later times -- a systemdesigned to facilitate psychological and spiritual transcendence along lines reminiscent of both"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"classical Taoism and Ch'an Buddhism (which was, of course, deeply indebted to Chuang-tzu inparticular).xiv For present purposes, I propose to refer to those elements of the Taoist traditionas \"mystical Taoism,\" a term that I borrow from the recent work of Livia Kohn. However, Iemploy this term here in a somewhat different sense than Kohn does: I shall use the termprimarily in order to contrast all these elements with the more social, ritual, and sacerdotaltraditions of Taoism, to which such scholars as Norman Girardot have sometimes referred, quiteproperly, as \"liturgical Taoism.\" Before I return to the broader interpretive questions, I shallundertake the formidable task of identifying some of the fundamental continuities anddiscontinuities that seem to exist between those two types of Taoist practice.\"Mystical Taoism\" and \"Liturgical Taoism\" When seeking the principal distinction between \"liturgical Taoism\" and \"mystical Taoism,\"an immediate thought is that the former is essentially a social tradition, whereas the latter isessentially an individual matter. Indeed, there would seem to be more than a kernel of truth insuch a notion. But I think that we should also beware oversimplification. \"Liturgical Taoism\"does pertain in real ways to the life of the individual, just as \"mystical Taoism\" does pertain tosociety as a whole. Yet, there are subtle differences, especially in terms of how each conceivesof the problems that it is addressing. That is, perhaps the key differences between the two residein their precise conceptions of the soteriological enterprise. In part, the difference seems toinvolve the degree to which a person is conceived as attaining the Taoist goal as someoneidentified in terms of a specific social, familial and cultural context. Liturgical Taoism seems totake such matters seriously when offering its soteriological schema. Mystical Taoism, on theother hand, seems to conceive of the individual as something of a more generalized existentialmonad -- a cog, perhaps, in the cosmos, but not in the community, except in a fairly sanitizedsense. The Taoist mystic may be part of society (on a certain rarefied level, at least), but he isseldom presented as being in any meaningful way a part of his local community. When the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Taoist mystic pursues the goal of self-perfection, he may happen to be in a certain specificlocale, but in his pursuit he is decidedly not of that locale. That is, his \"true\" identity is not seenas being in any real way tied to that community, or to his roles within it. Within liturgicalTaoism, the opposite is true: the individual is often conceived as a member of a specific humancommunity, a specific time and place with its real-life web of interrelationships. LiturgicalTaoism generally accepts the reality and the value of the individual's localized, historicizedexistence, while mystical Taoism generally seems not to do so. This having been said, it must of course be granted that what we are dealing with here is byno means a polar opposition, but rather a broad continuum. One could argue, for instance, thatChuang-tzu is further toward the \"mystical\" end of the spectrum than is Lao-tzu, since the Tao teching accepts the need to address social, political, and even military issues that are seldomaddressed in the Chuang-tzu (particularly in the earlier chapters). But part of the abiding appealof Lao-tzu -- particularly in overseas markets, such as our own -- has always been itstimelessness, its lack of \"cultural baggage\" -- a virtually complete absense of distractingreferences to any specifically localized realities. As recent North American experience hasdemonstrated, it seems to be as easy for a modern person to be a Lao- Chuang Taoist as it wasfor a person of antiquity, and nearly as easy for a Westerner as for a Chinese. The reason is thatLao-Chuang soteriology is generalized, cosmicized, and internalized. To moderns, such asoteriology is highly attractive, in part, at least, because it mirrors so much of the modernsentiment, particularly in religious terms: the Taoist mystic is alone with the Tao -- quitedivorced from the \"external\" realities of his family and community -- just as the ProtestantChristian is alone with God, in no need of priest or liturgy. Moderns -- Chinese and Westernersalike -- generally exult in the self-esteem generated by the romantic conceit that the individual isfree from all external constraints, and can achieve for her- or himself whatever he or she chooses.Self-perfection for the Taoist mystic (as for the Confucian \"Sage\") is, in theory, completelywithin the grasp of the individual alone, with little need for the mediation of anyone else, neitherother people nor spiritual beings. In seeking the religious goal, one is in no way restricted by"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"one's so-called \"external\" identity, nor by any of the real-life problems that afflict that real-lifeidentity. In other words, I suggest that mystical Taoism has achieved the respect and affection ofWesterners because it seems delightfully Protestant, whereas liturgical Taoism has frequentlybeen dismissed and disparaged because, unconsciously, it has often seemed painfully reminiscentof Catholicism.xv To return to the Taoist spectrum, one might suggest that along the \"mystical\" end thespectrum, the soteriological media are variously moral and meditative, employing models ofindividual cultivation or transformation. The soteriology of mystical Taoism usually involves aprocess that might be termed personal re-perspectivization -- a transformative process of self-rediscovery that involves a new mode of perceiving reality. Along the \"liturgical\" end of thespectrum, on the other hand, the soteriological media are primarily moral and ritual, and themodels are variously developmental and restorative. A primary assumption that underlies theentire spectrum seems to be that one's proper involvement in the processes of the universe resultsin the person (and sometimes the society or community) achieving a restoration of properperspective, and a balance and harmony that was previously missing. In addition, both\"mystical\" and \"liturgical\" Taoism work to focus the individual in to the deeper elements ofreality underlying the domain of our everyday lives, and provide a rectification of our livesthrough a realignment with those deeper realities. What the liturgical tradition offers is a much more active and interactive mode of effectingthat realignment. In liturgical Taoism, a single individual sometimes plays a single role: forinstance, the practitioner of early Ling-pao Taoism participated directly in the process of cosmicre-harmonization by reciting the sacred text of the Tu-jen ching (\"The Scripture for HumanSalvation\"), which was conceived as being an emanation of the Tao itself. In so doing, thepractitioner actually effected her or his own salvation, and helped restore the cosmic order bydrawing upon the salvific power crystallized in that text. In later forms of liturgical Taoism,roles were often differentiated into a more active role (that of the officiant) and a more passiverole (that of the other participants). Even there, however, both parties are involved in a process"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of spiritual interaction, a participatory process that is at once person- transcendent and person-specific. That is, one participates in the spiritual process not only as an element of the cosmos asa whole, but also as a specific individual, whose identity within a specific local community isimplicitly assumed and re-valorized. The ritual begins with one's localized, contextualizedexistence; carries one into and through a transcendent, sacred realm; and eventually returns oneto one's everyday life in a new point, a point near where one began, but nonetheless distinct.Now, the time and space within which one lives are newly sacralized (or, at the least, theirinherent sacrality is newly disclosed). At the same time, the individual is morally and spirituallyrenewed, and, when all goes well, he or she undergoes (or is at least prepared for undergoing) aspiritual transformation. At this point, the individual may pursue that transformative processmore intensively, either through deepened participation in the liturgical tradition itself, orthrough involvement in some of the pursuits more typical of the \"mystical\" end of the spectrum.Elitism and Self-Cultivation in the Liturgical Tradition The liturgical tradition has often been characterized as \"popular Taoism,\" and has long beendisparaged as a religion of the superstitious masses. It often seems to be assumed that it thatcould hold no interest for someone who esteems the pursuit of self-perfection that is soprominent in classics of ancient Taoist philosophy. But such attitudes, I argue, reflect the biasesof both the Confucian intellegentsia of late imperial China, and those of modern Westerners,whose views of religion are imbued not only with a bias against ritual and priesthood, but alsoperhaps with a bit of the Marxist contention that religion is \"the opiate of the people.\" In termsof positions like that of H. G. Creel, liturgical Taoism seems often to be dismissed as a childishindulgence fit only for simple minds, as opposed, of course, to the grand sophistication ofthinkers like Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu. Here, again, one must note that neither Creel nor Fung"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Yu-lan seem ever to have perused any of the texts of Taoist religious thought of T'ang or Sungtimes and beyond. Such Ch'uan-chen masters as Li Tao-ch'un, or even Ch'ing writers like Liu I-ming, certainly demonstrate that thoughtful Taoist ruminations upon the human condition did notsuddenly dry up after Lieh-tzu or the so-called \"Neo- Taoists\" of the Three Kingdoms period(who, like Ko Hung, were actually fairly Confucian in orientation). But what must berecognized is that the forms that Taoism took in later imperial China underwent a vast historicshift for specific historical reasons. It is to that historical shift within the evolution of Taoismthat I now turn. The tradition of liturgical Taoism was, from its origins in the Six Dynasties, by no stretch ofthe imagination a development that occurred among the masses. It is true that the movement ofthe Celestial Masters in Han times sought and received support on the local level, but that wasonly because the emperors of the Later Han had, from the Taoist perspective, abrogated theirresponsibility to unite and harmonize Heaven, Earth and Humanity. Bereft of imperialpatronage, the Celestial Masters had taken matters into their own hands, and had sought theparticipation of people of all levels of society. Be that as it may, the Celestial Masterorganization died out during the Six Dynasties. It was only after the revolutionary Shang- ch'ingand Ling-pao revelations of the fourth century that the liturgical practices evolved that becamethe backbone of all later Taoist liturgy. The formulator of those practices was the fifth-centuryreformer Lu Hsiu-ching, and his formulation of the primary Taoist liturgy was revived in thesixth century by T'ao Hung-ching. Both of those men were members of the social elite insouth China, and both were honored by the rulers of their day. The Taoist tradition of thesubsequent T'ang dynasty retained that elite cast, while preserving the universalistic ideal of theLing-pao liturgy. Hence, the institutions of liturgical Taoism in its heyday were anything but\"popular\": they were highly elitist, in more sense than one. Not only were the leaders of thetradition highly educated, well-to-do, and politically well-connected.xvi But in addition, fullparticipation in the tradition was the exclusive province of individuals who had proventhemselves worthy. In the fourth century, participation had sometimes been restricted to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"members of a certain prominent clan, or to a tiny circle of people who had received the formaltransmission of a certain Taoist text. From the fifth century onward, full participation in theinner realities of Taoism was generally predicated upon the moral and spiritual worth of theindividual. That is, religious practices were expected to be linked to one's level of personalachievement in spiritual self-cultivation.xvii In the present context, it seems sufficient to statethat up to about the time of the Mongol conquest, Taoism maintained a primary concern with theindividual's degree of success in a transformative spiritual process, a process of personalrediscovery that either assumed or resulted in an elevated mode of perceiving reality. Thatenduring Taoist emphasis profoundly affected the evolution of both Ch'an Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism.xviiiThe Marginalization of Liturgical Taoism Around the time that north China came under the control of the Jurchen and Mongols in thetwelfth and thirteenth centuries, a major shift occurred in the socio-cultural status of Taoism.Under the conquest regimes, members of the Han Chinese elite were often under governmentsuspicion and scrutiny, and their public activities were affected accordingly. The intellegentsiagenerally succumbed to real or perceived political pressure, and endeavored to \"play it safe.\"Aspiring young men circumspectly developed careers along lines that seemed politically safeand economically secure. And, under these conditions, it was clearly more prudent to cultivatesagehood in private than it was to participate in a tradition that involved a public liturgy. Theimportance of this point for understanding Taoist history must not be underestimated. TheMongols and, later, the Manchus, were extremely wary of possible uprisings among theirChinese subjects, and kept a very close eye upon virtually all collective activities among thosesubjects. Even among the Chinese rulers of the Ming dynasty, social control was a fundamental"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"concern, for a very practical reason: one individual alone can pose little political threat, butpeople who gather to form groups can pose a threat. Hence, in late imperial China, any Chineseperson with a healthy concern for personal safety (much less socio-economic advancement)would have seen the prudence of taking no part in religious activities that featured a highlyvisible social component. This was particularly true in regard to Taoism, which had always beenloyal to the throne, but had also at times been exploited for political legitimation by rebels whoarose to change the political mandate (sometimes successfully).xix Hence, after the Mongol conquest, the Taoist liturgical tradition became increasinglymarginalized, and fewer and fewer of the Chinese elite took part in the tradition, at least inleadership roles. Those who did step forward to participate as leaders of the liturgical traditionwere increasingly men who already had limited prospects for political or economic advancement.Those who had realistic hopes for a career in government had little motivation to participate inliturgical activities. In Chinese history in general, the further one travelled down the road towardthe goal of government service, the less one's life was grounded in the realities of one's naturalfamily, community, or even one's native dialect: those studying in hopes of attaining publicoffice were compelled, significantly, to endless hours of individualized intellectual activity,often under the tutelage of a mentor who represented both socio-political achievement and moralwisdom. It is thus hardly surprising that the religious aspirations in which such students tookinterest often involved a process of individualized self-development and a goal of personaltranscendence. Here we see the context for the emergence of both Neo-Confucianism and thehighly personalized Taoist movements of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries. Some of thoseTaoist movements (which Kubo Noritada aptly dubbed \"the Taoist Reformation\") rejected thesocial focus of the liturgical tradition in favor of a return to an ideal of individual purification, anideal swathed in the rhetoric of classical Taoism but actualized in terms of the individualizedmeditative practices of Six Dynasties Shang-ch'ing Taoism and the more Buddhisticizedpractices of T'ang times. Here we find a \"parting of the Way\" within what has usually beencalled \"religious Taoism\": from the conquest period onward, and only from that period, the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"\"mystical\" tradition of Taoism began to become distanced from the liturgical tradition, whichhad long been the pride of the religion. From that period on, those who were religiously inclinedbegan to fall increasingly into two camps: (1) a cultural elite who practiced an individualized,\"mystical\" pursuit of self-perfection, and (2) a far less elite component, composed of people whocherished Taoist spiritual ideals but faced the very practical necessity of making a living. Thesecond group became the main participants in the modern liturgical tradition in Taoism. Tothese people, the religious life became -- by necessity -- a profession, and their activities became-- by necessity -- a public service, a service performed, as always, for the benefit of all, but nowunderwritten by members of the local community. It is at this point, also, that we can see the origins of the modern prejudice against liturgicalTaoism, a prejudice that clearly never existed in earlier times. Careful analysis of Chinesehistorical and biographical materials reveals that down through the Sung period, the literati elite -- from politicians to poets -- were frequently well-acquainted with Taoist matters that manytoday would tend to consider quite \"sectarian.\"xx In addition, the leaders of the Taoist liturgicaltradition enjoyed the trust and the respect of both the Chinese government and the scholar-officials who made it run.xxi But the new socio-political conditions of the Chin, Yuan, Mingand Ch'ing periods discouraged ambitious men with promising futures from undertaking asacerdotal career. And the more marginalized Taoism became in political, social, and economicterms, the more marginalized it became in terms of mainstream socio-cultural ideology. In otherwords, from Sung times on, Taoism became branded as \"politically incorrect.\" Those whowished to lead a respected life in the public sphere began not only to eschew Taoism, butfrequently felt compelled to denigrate it as well. The Neo-Confucians of late Sung times arewell-known for their mania for \"orthodoxy\": thinkers competed to see who could be more\"Confucian\" than whom, and branded each other as heretics (and even, sometimes, as \"closetBuddhists\"). Many intellectuals in that period felt a need to justify themselves ideologically, andto protect themselves politically, by professing their own ideological probity. An ignoble buthighly effective method of achieving those ends is to cast aspersions upon others: if we can"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"paint some other party in unflattering colors, and succeed in having such a caricature accepted bysociety at large, their stock falls and our stock rises. After Sung times, leaders of the Taoistliturgical tradition came to be re-defined as outcasts from the Chinese mainstream, and wereultimately denigrated as \"charlatans\" who deceived the gullible with a hodgepodge ofmeaningless superstitions. With each passing generation, the leaders of Chinese society becameever more distanced from the healthier (and more truly ecumenical) society of T'ang times, andever more alienated from the liturgical dimensions of the Taoist. Each generation arose in evergreater ignorance of liturgical Taoism and its prominent place in earlier Chinese government,society, and culture. Each generation of the Chinese elite became more antagonistic to Taoismas a social reality, and found an ideological exemption only for certain carefully sanitizedremnants of the Taoist heritage. Such righteous remnants included most notably the ancientphilosophical classics, and, for some intellectuals, certain traditions of individualized self-cultivation. In other words, the only elements of Taoism that survived the ideological purge oflate imperial China were those elements that smelled safe and comfortable to Confucians --classics passed down to us from ancient sages, vouchsafing to the enlightened reader the pureand noble path to his own eventual, individualized sagehood.The West's Re-Creation of \"Taoism\" Such was the cultural reality encountered by the first Western observers to have theopportunity to set up shop in China -- the Christian missionaries. It is very significant, however,that the Jesuit enterprise had been aborted by Rome, so that it was actually the Protestantmissionaries of the nineteenth century who endeavored to serve as midwife at the birth of a new,\"enlightened\" China. In the minds of these Westerners, and their descendants in the earlytwentieth century, the \"new\" China now being born would have the body of its Chinese motherbut the mind and spirit of its Western father. That is, the newly purified China would implicitlypreserve those elements of Chinese culture that fit neatly with the Westerners' ideals. And those"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ideals, conceived in Greek rationalism, had, during the Reformation and Enlightenment, beenpurified of the \"superstitious\" dross of Catholic religiosity that had allegedly mired civilizationduring the \"Dark Ages.\" Thus, what passed muster as respectable religion consisted, once again,of a sanitized version of traditional religion, in which the ancient sacred text vouchsafed to theenlightened reader the pure and noble path to his own eventual individualized salvation. And,as modern Chinese and Western intellectuals worked to write the history of Chinese culture andcatalogue its contributions to civilization, their picture of Taoism emerged along predictablysimilar lines. Liturgical Taoism was not only decried as superstition unworthy of a respectableintellectual, but was furthermore charged with having audaciously committed a despicable theftand fraud: the ritualistic priests with all their silly mumbo-jumbo had audaciously stolen thename of \"Taoism\" from the sainted ancient philosophers Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu. (Echoes oftimeworn Protestant charges against Catholocism are once again unmistakable here.) Creelinsisted that it was, after all, Chuang-tzu alone who presented the original, pure, and noble idealsof Taoism. But it must be noted that those ideals were generally interpreted as presenting ararefied individual pursuit of spiritual self-perfection, which devalorizes, and in fact definesaway, the boring and wart- covered realities of one's everyday life as a member of one's ownactual family and local community. This rarefied \"Taoist\" vision common to many moderninterpreters is able to provide the individual with a blissful sense of pride and satisfaction, onseveral important counts:(1) one is neither stained nor trapped by the frustrations and inadequacies of one's presentlife as So-and-so in such-and-such place;(2) the negative and unpleasant aspects of that life can legitimately be ignored, for theydo not represent true reality;(3) true reality is transcendent, and is only accessible by direct experience; and yet, anyreally subtle person (such as, of course, oneself) can manage to attain such an experiencewith no special training, and no outside assistance;"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(4) a person who follows this path is spiritually exalted, morally blameless, and exemptfrom all criticism.With these facts in mind, it is little wonder that such a sanitized (if not, indeed, fictionalizedversion of \"Taoism\" (like analogously sanitized versions of Zen) has proven irresistible tomodern Westerners. This is the vision of \"the Taoist path\" that has made a cottage-industry outof publishing new versions of the Tao te ching, and has convinced more than a few youngWesterners that they have finally found the only real truth of life -- sanitized even of the dross oftheir own Western heritage. The fact that such a vision of Taoism might not actually coincidewith the documentable facts of the tradition's history, teachings, and practices has never beenconsidered relevant, because the vision is too beautiful to surrender. Rather than have tosacrifice it on the altar of factuality, intellectuals like Fung Yu-lan and H. G. Creel happilyaccepted and perpetuated those interpretations of Chinese cultural history that preserve thislovely vision from all stain, real or imagined.Conclusion If, however, we today choose to face the realities of Chinese history, we apparently must doso at the cost of losing the illusory though highly alluring vision of the unsullied Taoist path toindividual self-perfection. As an element of traditional Chinese civilization, Taoism was a vastlyricher and more complex reality, a reality to which we do terrible violence by attempting tomaintain the quite dubious dichotomy of an original \"pure\" philosophical Taoism and a later,degenerate \"popular\" Taoism. Like Confucianism, which features both the pursuit of individualsagehood and a cult with temples, priests, and hymns to the divinity Confucius, Taoism is also acultural tradition that embraces a wide array of social, moral, philosophical, and religious valuesand activities.

See also Russell Kirkland, \"The Making of an Immortal:The Exaltation of Ho Chih-chang,\" Numen 38 (1991-92), 201-214.xv The same might be said for Confucianism: its religious dimension, one could argue, has been Protestantized byinterpreters like Taylor and Tu Wei-ming to the point that there seems to be little meaningful explanation for thetraditional Confucian cultus. One need hardly mention that Tu's vision of Confucianism is even more thoroughlysanitized, purified of any lingering cultural baggage that might put off the modern individual -- who would prefer tosee the Confucian goal as a purely internal, abstract process of individual spiritual refinement, accessible to one andall. For example, Tu endeavors to purge Confucian ideals of the sexism that was implicit in the tradition before thetwentieth century (or indeed, perhaps, the present generation). See, e.g., Tu Wei-ming, \"Neo-Confucian Religiosityand Human-Relatedness,\" in his Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation (Albany: StateUniversity of New York Press, 1985), pages 131-148, at page 145.xvi See Russell Kirkland, \"The Last Taoist Grand Master at the T'ang Imperial Court: Li Han-kuang and T'angHsu\"an-tsung,\" T'ang Studies 4 (1986), 43-67; and Taoist and Dynast. xvii See Kirkland, \"The Making of an Immortal: The Exaltation of Ho Chih- chang.\"xviii Cf. T. H. Barrett, Li Ao: Buddhist, Taoist, or Neo-Confucian? (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992). Itshould be noted that, as Barrett demonstrates, the T'ang was a period of complex interaction among the traditions,not of any simple one-way causitive influence.xix These matters are addressed directly in my \"Last Taoist Grand Master at the T'ang Imperial Court,\" and Taoistand Dynast.xx In addition to Barrett's work, one should note a number of studies by Edward H. Schafer, especially his Mirageson the Sea of Time: The Taoist Poetry of Ts'ao T'ang (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), espeicallypp. 1-15; \"Wu Yu\"n's `Cantos on Pacing the Void', Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 41 (1981), 377-415, and\"Wu Yu\"n's Stanzas on `Saunters in Sylphdom',\" Monumenta Serica 35 (1981-83), 1-37. Also noteworthy areseveral studies by Paul W. Kroll, such as \"Verses from On High: The Ascent of T'ai Shan,\" T'oung Pao n.s. 69(1983), 223-60.xxi In addition to the studies previously cited, see further Russell Kirkland, \"Taoists of the High T'ang: An Inquiryinto the Perceived Significance of Eminent Taoists in Medieval Chinese Society\" (Dissertation, Indiana University,1986); Charles Benn, \"Religious Aspects of Emperor Hsu\"an-tsung's Taoist Ideology,\" in Buddhist and TaoistPractice in Medieval Chinese Society (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1987); and Franciscus Verellen,\"Liturgy and Sovereignty: The Role of Taoist Ritual in the Foundation of the Shu Kingdom (907-925)\" Asia Major,3rd series, 2 (1989), 59-78."}]
