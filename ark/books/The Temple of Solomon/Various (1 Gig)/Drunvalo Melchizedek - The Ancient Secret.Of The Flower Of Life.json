I can’t name them all, but Ifeel a need to recognize a few.First of all, the two angels who entered my life long ago and who have lovingly guided my life, you are most honored. Thoth,the ascended master from Atlantis, Egypt and Greece, has given me a great deal of the information in this book. My family, mywife Claudette and my children, who have been my greatest love and inspiration in life. The 200 facilitators teaching this workof the Flower of Life in 33 countries, who have given me invaluable feedback, support and love that has kept me strong. Thethousands of students who have written loving letters telling how this work has changed their lives; this has given me strengthto continue. Livea Cherish, who put this work into book form from the video format, and Margaret Pinyan, whose fine editingability allows this book to read so smoothly. Tim Stouse, who created about half the computer graphics, and Michael Tyree, whocreated the other half; they have made it possible to understand what was being said. And O’Ryin Swanson, the owner of LightTechnology Publishing, who had the faith in me to publish this work.To the rest of you who are too numerous to name, I thank you all from my heart with the prayer that this work will actuallyhelp people understand who they really are so that together we can create a more loving world—and perhaps even a moreloving universe. Thank you, dear ones.PREFPREFPREFPREFPREFACEACEACEACEACEOnly one Spirit.Long before Sumeria existed, before Egypt had built Saqqara, before the Indus Valley nourished, Spirit lived in humanbodies, dancing in high culture.

All life, not only here but everywhere, knew it was the creation pattern — theway in, the way out. Spirit created us in this image. You know this is true; it is written in your body, in all your bodies.Long ago we fell from a very high state of consciousness, and the memories are just now beginning to emerge. Thebirth of our new/old consciousness here on Earth will change us forever and return us to the awareness that there is trulyonly one Spirit.What you’re about to read is a journey of my life through this reality, how I learned about Great Spirit and about therelationships that each of us have with all life everywhere. I see Great Spirit in the eyes of everyone, and I know that He/She iswithin you. You already hold within your deepest being all the information I will be sharing with you. When you first read it, it mayseem like something you’ve never heard before, but it isn’t. This is ancient information. You can remember things that are deepinside you, and it’s my hope that this book will trigger these things so you can remember who you are, why you came here, andwhat your purpose is for being here on Earth.It is my prayer that this book will become a blessing in your life and give you a new awakening about yourself and some-thing about you that is very, very old. Thank you for sharing this journey with me. I love you deeply, for in truth we are old friends.We are One.DrunvaloINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTIONPart of my purpose in presenting this work is to assist people to be aware of certain events that have happened on thisplanet or are presently happening or are about to happen, events that are radically affecting our consciousness and the waywe’re living today. By understanding our present situation, we can open to the possibility of a new consciousness, a newhumanity emerging on Earth. In addition, perhaps, my dearest purpose is to inspire you to remember who you really are andgive you the courage to bring your gift to this world. For God has given each one of us a unique talent which, when truly lived,changes the physical world into a world of pure light.I’ll also be giving mathematical and scientific evidence to show how we got here, as spiritual beings in a physical world, inorder to convince the left-brain analytical part of us that there is only one consciousness and one God, and that we are all partof that Oneness. This is important, for it brings both sides of the brain into balance. This balance opens the pineal gland andallows the prana, the life-force energy, to enter the innermost part of our physical being. Then and only then is the body of lightcalled the Mer-Ka-Ba possible.However, please understand that the evidence I originally learned this information from is in itself not important. Theinformation could in most cases be completely changed to different information without affecting the outcome. In addition, Imade many mistakes because I am now human. What is most interesting to me is that every time I made a mistake, it led intoa deeper understanding of the Reality and a higher truth. So I say to you, if you find an error, look deeper. If you get hung up on"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"4the information by overestimating its value, you will totally miss the point of the work. What I have just said is paramount tounderstanding this work.I’ll also be giving my personal experiences, many of which are, I admit, outrageous by the ordinary world’s standards.Perhaps they are not so outrageous by the old world’s standards, but it is you who must decide if they are true or are just stories— or if it even matters. Listen deeply with your heart, for your heart always knows the truth. Then I intend to share with you, asmuch as I can in the second volume, a specific breathing technique that will help you return to the vastly higher state ofconsciousness from which we all came. It is the remembrance of the breath connected to the lightbody of the Mer-Ka-Ba. Thisis one of the primary purposes of this work.At this point a short story of how this book came about is in order. You will read about the angels, so I will not begin there,but rather with the later events. In 1985 the angels asked me to begin teaching the meditation of the Mer-Ka-Ba. I first learnedit in 1971 and had been practicing it ever since, but I did not want to become a teacher. My life was easy and fulfilled. Basically,I was comfortable and didn’t want to work so hard. The angels said that when someone is given spiritual knowledge, they mustshare it. They said it was a law of creation.Knowing they were right, I opened my first class to the public in the spring of 1985. By 1991 my workshops were filled andoverflowing, with hundreds of people on the waiting list. I didn’t know how to reach everyone who wanted this information. Infact, I could not. So in 1992 I made a decision to release a video of one of my workshops and let it go out to the world.Within less than a year it was exploding in sales, but there was one big problem. Most of the people who were watching thevideos could not really understand what was presented because it was outside the context and content of their spiritual under-standing. I gave a lecture to ninety people in Washington State, all of whom had seen the video tapes but had never been to oneof my live workshops. It was there that I realized that only about 15 percent of the people actually knew how to live themeditation by using only the instructions on the video tapes. It was not working. Eighty-five percent were confused and unclearabout the instructions.Immediately I took the video tapes off the market. This, however, did not stop the video from continuing to be sold. Peoplewanted the information, so they began to copy the existing tapes and give, sell or lease them to people worldwide. By 1993, ithas been estimated that there were approximately 100,000 sets of these tapes in the world.A decision was made. It was determined that the only way we could be responsible with this information was to have atrained person in the room when someone watched the video tapes. Trained means that we had carefully instructed a personto know and live the Mer-Ka-Ba. That person could then orally teach another. This is how the Flower of Life facilitator programwas born. There are now over 200 trained facilitators in at least 33 countries. And the system has worked very well.Now things are changing again. People are beginning to understand higher consciousness and its value and concepts. It isnow time to release this book to the general public, which is now ready, we feel. A book has the advantage that people can takemore time to study the drawings and photos carefully at leisure. And it will also have current updated information such asfollows:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"5Update: The times they are a-changing for sure! According to Dow Jones Company, Inc. in their magazine Ameri-can Demo’ graphics, February 1997, a ten-year scientific study has revealed that a brand-new culture is emerging inAmerica and the Western world at this moment. Some have called this new culture the New Age, but it has had othernames, depending on the country.From our experience, we believe it is a worldwide emerging culture. It is a culture that deeply believes in God,family, children, spirit, Mother Earth and a healthy environment, femininity, honesty, meditation, life on other planetsand the unity of all life everywhere. The members of this new culture believe, according to the study, that they are fewand scattered. The survey revealed, however, to everyone’s complete surprise, that “they” are one in every fouradults in America — an amazing 44 million adults strong.’ Something huge is happening here. Now that the moneymovers are aware of this enormous new market, you bet things will change. Everything from movie and TV contentto the use of energy to the foods we eat and much more will be affected. Our very interpretation of the Reality mayeven eventually change. You are not alone, and it will not take long now for this fact to be apparent to everyone.Ever since the angels first appeared in 1971,1 have been following their guidance. This is still true today. It was the angelswho gave me the meditation of the Mer-Ka-Ba, and it is the meditation that is important here, not the information that ispresented. The information is used just to bring us to a point of clarity so we can enter into a particular state of consciousness.Understand that as I received the scientific information in the early years from 1971 to about 1985, I thought it was for myown personal growth. When I would read a scientific paper or magazine, I would discard it, not realizing that in the future I wouldhave to prove what I was saying. Most of the articles have been located, but not all. Yet this information needs to go out. You,the reader, have strongly requested it. Therefore, wherever I can I will document my statements, but some proofs are lost, atleast for the moment.Also, part of the information is from nonscientific sources such as angels or interdimensional communications. We under-stand that “straight science” needs to be separated from a source who is considered psychic. Scientists are concerned abouttheir credibility. As a side note, I would like to comment that this is similar to a male saying to a female that her feelings are notvalid and that only logic is true or valid, that logic must be followed. Naturally, she knows another way; it is the way of life itself.It flows. It has no “male logic,” but it is equally true. I believe in both, in balance.If you can conceive of a person using both science and psychic abilities together to explore the Reality, you have come tothe right place. Whenever possible I will differentiate between the two types of sources so that you are clear. This means thatyou must go within yourself to see if this information is true within your world. If something does not feel right, then discard it andgo on. If it feels right, then live it and see if it is really true. But it is my understanding that the mind will never really know theReality until it has joined with the heart. Male and female complete each other.When you read this work you have two choices: You can come from your left brain, your male side, and take notes andcarefully see the logic in each step, or you can come from your right brain, your female side, just let go and don’t think — feel,watch it like a movie, expanded, not contracted. Either way will work. It is your choice."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6Finally, as I prepared this book, I had to make another decision. Should the final stages of the meditation, the Mer-Ka-Baitself, be released? I still feel that an oral teacher is best. Would you jump to the final stages ofTi-betan Buddhism after readingone book? What has been decided is that everything will be given here up to the time of the 1993 video, with the precaution thatyou carefully enter the Mer-Ka-Ba and still seek out a Flower of Life facilitator. That information will be given at the end of thesecond volume. Much has been learned after and beyond these writings that can only be given orally and experientially.The reason I am giving out the full information is that there are now at least seven other authors who have reprinted thiswork in one form or another. Some have taken it word for word, some have paraphrased me, and some have used my artworkand sacred geometry drawings. Some have asked and some have not. But the end result is that the information is out. Much ofit has been distorted and sometimes it is just plain not true. Please know that it is not to protect myself, but to be responsible forthe integrity of the work. This information belongs to the universe, not me. It is only the purity of the information that I amconcerned with, and your clear understanding of it.The exact instructions for the meditation are on the Internet [www.floweroflife.com], but of course not the hidden knowl-edge. That is experiential. You must live it. There is other information on the Net that states it is coming from me when it is not.There is also information out about the Flower of Life that is simply wrong or out of date. Hopefully, this work will make clearwhat has been veiled or distorted. I understand that these people were coming from their hearts, looking for the truth, but it isstill my responsibility to you.Therefore, in order to be clear and set the record straight, I am writing this book for all of you who wish to truly understandand know the truth.In love and service, Drunvalo Melchizedek"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"7O N ERemembering Our Ancient PastHow the FHow the FHow the FHow the FHow the Fall of Atlantis Changed Our Realityall of Atlantis Changed Our Realityall of Atlantis Changed Our Realityall of Atlantis Changed Our Realityall of Atlantis Changed Our RealityAlittle less than 13,000 years ago, something very dramatic happened inthe history of our planet that we’re going to explore in great detail,because what happened in the past is now affecting every aspect ofour lifetoday. Everything we experience in our daily living, including the particu-lar technologies we use, the wars that erupt, the foods we eat and even the way weperceive our lives, is the direct result of a certain sequence of events that happenedduring the end of Atlantean times. The consequences of these ancient events haveentirely changed the way we live and interpret reality.Everything is connected! There is only one Reality and one God, but thereare many, many ways that the one Reality can be interpreted. In fact, the num-ber of ways to interpret the Reality are just about infinite. There are certainrealities that many people have agreed on, and these realities are called levelsof consciousness. For reasons we’ll get into, there are specific realities thatextremely large numbers of beings are focusing on, which include the one youand I are experiencing right now.At one time we existed on Earth in a very high level of awareness that was farbeyond anything we can even imagine right now. We hardly have even the capabil-ity to imagine where we once were, because who we were then is so out of contextwith who we are now. Because of the particular events that happened between16,000 and 13,000 years ago, humanity fell from that very high place through manydimensions and overtones, ever increasing in density, until we reached this particu-lar place, which we call the third dimension on planet Earth, the modem world.When we fell—and it was like a fall—we were in an uncontrolled spiral of con-sciousness moving down through the dimensions of consciousness. We were outof control, and it was very much like falling through space. When we arrived here inthe third dimension, certain specific changes took place, both physiologically and inthe way we functioned in the Reality. The most important change was in the way we"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8Fig. 1-1. The star tetrahedralfield that surrounds each of us."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"9breathed prana, a Hindu word for the life-force energy of this universe. Prana is more critical toour survival than air, water, food or any other substance, and the manner in which we take thisenergy into our bodies radically affects how we perceive the Reality.In Atlantean times and earlier, the way we breathed prana was directly related to the electro-magnetic energy fields that surround our bodies. All the energy forms in our fields are geometric,and the one we will be working with is a star tetrahedron, which consists of two interlocked tetra-hedrons [Fig. 1-1]. Another way of thinking of it is as a three-dimensional Star of David.The apex of the upward-pointing tetrahedron terminates one hand’s length above the head,and the apex of the downward-pointing tetrahedron terminates one hand’s length below the feet. Aconnecting tube runs from the upper apex to the lower point through the body’s main energycenters, or chakras. This tube, for your body, has the diameter of the circle you make when youtouch your longest finger to your thumb. It looks like a glass fluorescent tube, except it has acrystalline structure at the ends that fit into the two apexes of the star tetrahedron.Before the fall of Atlantis, we used to bring prana simultaneously up and down this tube, andthe two prana flows would meet inside one of our chakras. Specifically how and where the pranameets has always been an important aspect of this ancient science, which today is still beingstudied throughout the universe.Another major point in the human body is the pineal gland, located almost in the center of the head, which is a huge factorin consciousness. This gland has degenerated from its original size, comparable to a ping-pong ball, to its present size, that ofa dried pea, because we forgot how to use it a long time ago—and if you don’t use it, you lose it.Pranic energy used to flow through the center of the pineal gland. This gland, according to Jacob Liberman, author of Light,the Medicine of the Future, looks like an eye, and in some respects it is literally an eyeball. It’s round and has an opening on oneportion; in that opening is a lens for focusing light. It’s hollow and has color receptors inside. Its primary field of view—thoughthis has not been determined scientifically—is upward, toward the heavens. Just as our eyes can look up to 90 degrees to theside from the direction they face, the pineal gland can also “look” as much as 90 degrees away from its set direction. Just as wecannot look out the back of our heads, the pineal gland cannot look down toward the Earth.Held inside the pineal gland—even in its shrunken size—are all the sacred geometries and understandings of exactly howthe Reality was created. It’s all there, in every single person. But these understandings are not accessible to us now becausewe lost our memories during the Fall, and without our memories we started to breathe differently. Instead of taking in pranathrough the pineal gland and circulating it up and down our central tube, we started breathing it in through the nose and mouth.This caused the prana to bypass the pineal gland, which resulted in our seeing things in a totally different way, through adifferent interpretation (called good and evil or polarity consciousness) of the One Reality. The result of this polarity conscious-ness has us thinking that we’re inside a body looking out, somehow separated from what’s “out there.” This is pure illusion. Itfeels real, but there is no truth at all to this perception. It’s merely the view of reality we have from this fallen state."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10For example, there is nothing wrong with anything that happens, for God is in control of the creation. But from one point ofview, a polarity view, looking at the planet and how it evolves, we should not have fallen down here. In a normal curve ofevolution, we should not be here. Something happened to us that was not supposed to happen. We went through a mutation—we had a chromosome breakage, you might say. So the Earth has been on red alert for almost 13,000 years, and many beingsand levels of consciousness have been working together to figure out how to get us back onto the path (DNA) where we werebefore.The effect of this “mistaken” fall in consciousness and the ensuing efforts to get us back on track is that something reallygood—something unexpected, something amazing—has resulted. Beings from all over the universe who have been trying tohelp us with our problem have initiated various experiments on us in an effort to assist, some legally and some without license.One particular experiment is resulting in a scenario that no one anywhere had ever dreamed would become a reality, exceptone person in a single culture from a long-distant past.The Mer-KThe Mer-KThe Mer-KThe Mer-KThe Mer-Ka-Baa-Baa-Baa-Baa-BaThere’s another major factor that we’re going to focus on in this story. Thirteen thousand years ago we were aware ofsomething about ourselves that we’ve since completely forgotten: The geometric energy fields around our bodies can beturned on in a particular way, which is also connected to our breath. These fields used to spin at close to the speed of lightaround our bodies, but they slowed down and stopped spinning afterthe Fall. When this field is turned back on and spins, it’s called a Mer-Ka-Ba, and its usefulness in this Reality is unparalleled. It gives us anexpanded awareness of who we are, connects us with higher levelsof consciousness and restores the memory of the infinite possibilitiesof our being.A healthy spinning Mer-Ka-Ba is fifty to sixty feet in diameter,proportionate to one’s height. The rotation of a spinning Mer-Ka-Bacan be displayed on a computer monitor using the appropriate instru-ments, and its appearance is identical with the infrared heat envelopeof the galaxy [Fig. 1-2]—the same basic shape as the traditional fly-ing saucer.The word Mer-Ka-Ba is made up of three smaller words, Mer, Kaand Ba, which, as we are using them, came from ancient Egyptian. Itis seen in other cultures as merkabah, merkaba and merkavah. Thereare several pronunciations, but generally you pronounce it as if thethree syllables are separate, with equal accents on each. Mer refersto a specific kind of light that was understood in Egypt only during theFig. 1-2. Infrared photo of a galaxy, called the Sombrero galaxy, showing itsheat envelope."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11Eighteenth Dynasty. It was seen as two counterrotating fields of light spinning in the same space, which are generated bycertain breathing patterns. Ka refers to the individual spirit and Ba refers to the spirit’s interpretation of its particular reality. In ourparticular reality, Ba is usually defined as the body or physical reality. In other realities where spirits don’t have bodies, it refersto their concepts or interpretation of the reality they bring with them.So the Mer-Ka-Ba is a counterrotating field of light that affects spirit and body simultaneously. It is a vehicle that can takespirit and body (or one’s interpretation of reality) from one world or dimension into another. In fact, the Mer-Ka-Ba is much morethan this, because it can create reality as well as move through realities. For our purposes here, however, we will focus mainlyon its aspect as an interdimensional vehicle (Mer-Ka-Vah means chariot in Hebrew) that will help us return to our original higherstate of consciousness.ReturReturReturReturReturning to Our Original Statening to Our Original Statening to Our Original Statening to Our Original Statening to Our Original StateTo be clear, returning to our original state is a natural process that can be easy or difficult according to our belief patterns.However, simply be’ coming involved with the technical relationships of the Mer-Ka-Ba, such as correcting our breathingpatterns or mentally realizing the infinite connections to all patterns of life, for example, is not enough. At least one other factoris even more important than the Mer-Ka-Ba itself, and that is the understanding, realization and living of divine love. For it isdivine love, sometimes referred to as unconditional love, that is the primary factor that allows the Mer-Ka-Ba to become a livingfield of light. Without divine love, the Mer-Ka-Ba is just a machine, and this machine will have limitations that will never allow thespirit that created it to return home and reach the highest levels of consciousness—the place where there are no levels.We must be experiencing and expressing unconditional love in order to move beyond a certain dimension, and the world isfast heading toward that higher place. We are heading away from the place of separatism where we see ourselves inside thebody looking out. That view will be gone soon, to be replaced with a different view of reality where we’ll have the sense andknowledge of absolute unity with all life; and that sense will grow more and more as we continue to move upward through eachlevel on our journey home.Later we will explore special ways of opening the heart—to kindle compassionate, unconditional love so that you can havea direct experience. If you can just let this happen, you may discover things about yourself that you didn’t know before.Dear reader: There are procedures in the workshops that cannot be reproduced on the tapes or in this book because theyare totally experiential. They are just as important as the knowledge, for without them the knowledge is worthless. The onlyway we can give these experiences now is through oral tradition through a living workshop. But that maychange in the future.A HigherA HigherA HigherA HigherA Higher, Inclusive Reality, Inclusive Reality, Inclusive Reality, Inclusive Reality, Inclusive RealityAnother component we’re going to focus on has many names, but in present-day terms it’s usually re-ferred to as the higher self. In the higher-self reality, we literally exist in other worlds besides this one. Thereare so many dimensions and worlds that it almost surpasses human capability to conceive of it. These levels"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12are very specific and mathematical, and the spacing and the wavelengths in and between these levels are identical to therelationships within musical octaves and other aspects of life. But right now your third-dimensional consciousness has probablybeen severed from your higher aspect, so you’re aware only of what’s going on here on Earth. This is not the norm for beingsexisting in a natural unfallen state. The norm is that beings first become aware of several levels at once, like chords in music,until finally, as they grow, they become aware of everything everywhere at once. The following example is unusual, but itdemonstrates what is being talked about.I’m in communication with someone right now who is aware of many levels at once. The scientists who are studyingher are speechless; they cannot understand how she does what she’s doing. She might be sitting in a room, yet sheclaims to be watching from outer space. NASA checked her out by asking her to “see” a specific satellite and give specificinformation that could be known only if someone were actually there. She gave them readings off their instruments, whichI’m sure seemed impossible to the scientists. She said she was flying alongside the satellite and simply read them. Hername is Mary Ann Schinfield. She is legally blind, yet she can walk around a room and no one would know that she cannotsee. How does she doit?Recently she called me, and while we were talking she asked if I would like to see through her eyes. Of course I said yes.Within a few breaths, my field of vision opened up, and I was looking at or through what looked like a huge television screenchac filled my field of vision. What I saw was astounding. It seemed that I was moving very fast through space without a body.I could see the stars, and at that moment Mary Ann and I, seeing through her eyes, were moving alongside a string of comets.She was very close to one of them.It was one of the most real out-of-body experiences I have ever had. Around the perimeter of this “TV screen” there wereabout twelve or fourteen smaller TV screens, each one giving extremely fast images. One of them up in the upper right-handcomer was flashing rapidly moving images such as triangles, light bulbs, circles, wavy lines, trees, squares etc. It was thisscreen that told her what was in the immediate space where her body was located. She could “see” through these seeminglyunrelated images. There was another screen in the bottom left-hand corner where she communicated with other extraterrestriallife that was within this solar system.Here is a person who is in a three-dimensional body on Earth, but has full memory and experience of living in otherdimensions. This manner of interrupting the Reality is unusual. People do not normally see inner TV screens, but we do exist inmany other worlds even though most of us are not aware of it.You presently exist on probably five or more levels. Though there is a break between this dimension and others, when youconnect with your higher self you mend that break, after which you start becoming aware of the higher levels and the higherlevels start paying more attention to you— communication begins! This connection to the higher self is probably the mostimportant thing that could happen in your life—more important than understanding any of the information I’ll be giving. Connect-ing with the higher self is more important than learning to activate the Mer-Ka-Ba, because if you connect yourself to your Self,you will get absolutely clear information on how to proceed step by step through any reality and how to lead yourself back homeinto the full consciousness of God. When you connect with your higher self, the rest will happen automatically. You will still have"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"13to live your life, but everything you do will have great power and wisdom within your actions, thoughts and emotions.Exactly how to connect with one’s higher self is what many people, including myself, have been trying to understand. Manypeople who have somehow made this connection often don’t know how it happened. In this course I’ll attempt to explain exactlyhow to connect with your higher self. I’ll do my best.LefLefLefLefLeft- and Right-Brain Realitiest- and Right-Brain Realitiest- and Right-Brain Realitiest- and Right-Brain Realitiest- and Right-Brain RealitiesThere’s one more component to this picture. I’ll be spending perhaps half of our time on left-brain information like geom-etries and facts and all kinds of information that to many spiritual people would seem totally unimportant. I’m doing this becausewhen we fell, we divided ourselves into two—really three, but primarily into two—main components, which we call male andfemale. The right brain, which controls the left side of our body, is our feminine component, though it’s truly neither male norfemale. This is where our psychic and emotional aspect lives. This component knows that there’s only one God and thatoneness is all there is. Though it can’t really explain it, it just knows the truth. So there are not a lot of problems with the femalecomponent.The problem is on the left side of the brain—the male component. Because of the nature of how the male brain is ori-ented—a mirror image of the female—it has its logical component forward (more dominant), while the female has its logicalcomponent toward the back (less dominant). The left brain does not experience oneness when it looks out into the Reality; allit sees is division and separation. For that reason, the male aspect of us is having a difficult rime down here on Earth. Even ourmajor sacred books such as the Koran, the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible have divided everything into opposites. Theleft brain experiences that there is God, but then there’s also the devil—perhaps not quite as strong as God, but a hugeinfluence. So even God is seen in terms of duality, as one pole of the opposing forces of dark and light. (This is not true in allsects of these religions. A few of them see that there is only God.)Undl the left brain is able to see the unity running through everything, to know that there is truly one spirit, one force, oneconsciousness moving through absolutely everything in existence—until it knows that unity beyond any doubt—then the mind isgoing to stay separated from itself, from its wholeness and from the fullness of its potential. Even if there’s the slightest doubtat all about unity, the left-brain aspect will hold us back, and we can no longer walk on water. Remember, even Thomas walkedon water for a short moment when Jesus asked him to, but one little cell in his big toe said, “Wait a minute, I can’t do this,” andThomas sank into the cold water of polarity reality.Where WWhere WWhere WWhere WWhere We’re Going with This Infore’re Going with This Infore’re Going with This Infore’re Going with This Infore’re Going with This InformationmationmationmationmationI’m dedicating a lot of our rime to showing you beyond any shadow of a doubt that there is only one image in everything.There is one and only one image that created all that exists, and that image is the same image that has formed the electromag-netic field around your body. The same geometries that are in your field can be found around everything—planets and galaxiesand atoms and everything else. We will examine this image in great detail."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14We’re also going to go into the history of the Earth, because it is veryimportant to our present situation. We cannot really understand howwe got here if we don’t know the process that led us to this point.So we’ll spend a considerable length of time talking about whathappened a long time ago; then slowly we’ll come forward until weget to what’s going on today. It’s all tied together. The same oldthing has been going on all along, and it’s still going on—in fact, ithas never stopped.Those of you who are predominantly right-brained may feel inclined toskip this left-brained material, yet it is most important for you to hang in there. It is throughbalance that spiritual health returns.When the left brain sees absolute unity, it begins to relax and the corpus callosum (the band of fibers joining the twohemispheres) opens in a new way, allowing an integration between the two sides. The link between the left and right brainwidens, a flow starts, information is passed back and forth, and the opposing sides of the brain begin to integrate andsynchronize with each other. If you’re hooked up for biofeedback, you can actually see this happening. This action turnson the pineal gland in a different manner and makes it possible for your meditation to activate the lightbody of the Mer-Ka-Ba. Then the whole process of regeneration and recovery of our previous higher levels of consciousness can proceed.It is a growth process.If you are studying any other spiritual practice, you do not need to stop in order to begin the work with the Mer-Ka-Ba—unless, of course, your teacher does not want to mix traditions. Other meditations that are based on truth can beextremely useful once the Mer-Ka-Ba is spinning, because then noticeable results can evolve very, very quickly. I willrepeat myself just so you know for sure: The lightbody of the Mer-Ka-Ba does not contradict or inhibit any other medita-tion or religion that upholds the belief that there is only one God.So far we’ve talked only about the ABCs of spirituality. These are just the beginning steps. But these first steps arethe most important ones I know.Your left brain may love all this information and file it away in neatly labeled pigeonholes; this is fine. Or you can justrelax and read this like an adventure story, a mind-stretcher, a fantasy.

Of course,usually these patterns were believed to be true at the time they were taught, butthen concepts and ideas changed, and the next generation was taught differenttruths.For example, the concept of the atom has changed dramatically so manytimes over the last ninety years that at this point they don’t really adhere to aconcept. They use one, but with the understanding that it may be wrong.At one time the atom was thought to be like a watermelon and the electronswere like seeds inside the watermelon. We really know very little about the Realitythat exists around us. Quantum physics has now shown us that the person perform-ing the experiment influences the outcome. In other words, consciousness canchange the outcome of an experiment, depending on its belief patterns.There are other aspects of ourselves we hold true that may not be true at all.One idea that has been held for a long time is that we’re the only planet in existencewith life on it. In our heart of hearts we know this is not true, but this planet will notadmit this truth in modern times even though there is powerful evidence of UFOsightings that have been coming from all over the world nonstop for over fifty years.Any subject other than UFOs would have been believed and accepted by the worldhad this subject not been so threatening.

The informationin it came from a book about Sirius, The Sirius Mystery by Rob-ert Temple. He had, I was told, between ten and twelve differentsubjects to choose from, each one of which would lead to thesame conclusion but from a totally different point of view. I’mglad he chose the one he did, because it happens to relate toanother aspect of what we will be talking about.Robert Temple was one of the first people to reveal certainfacts— though scientists have known for a long time—about anAfrican tribe near Timbuktu called the Dogons. This tribe holdsinformation that is simply impossible for them to have by anystandards in our view of the world today. Their information de-stroys everything we think we know about ourselves in regard tobeing alone.You see, the Dogons have a cave on their land thatstretches way back into a mountain, and in this cave are walldrawings over 700 years old. One particular man, the holyman of their tribe, sits at the front of this cave to protect it.This is his lifetime job. They feed him and take care of him,but no one can touch him or get close to him. When he dies,another holy man takes his place. In this cave are amazingdrawings and bits of information.I’m going to tell you about two of these bits—and these areonly two of many.First of all, we’re referring to the brightest star in the sky(with an apparent magnitude of-1.4)—Sirius, now called SiriusA. If you look at Orion’s Belt, those three stars in a row, andfollow the line downward to your left, you see a very bright star,which is Sirius A. If you follow them upward about twice the dis-tance, you see the Pleiades. The information in the Dogon cavespecifically showed another star rotating around Sirius. TheFig. 1-3. Dogon drawing or Nommo, the great culture hero who broughtcivilization to Earth. Because both eyes are shown in the drawings, they arepresumed to be plan views, which means the tail is opposed (like a dolphin)rather than lateral, as it is with a fish. The waterline is clearly indicated,implying that the Nommo iis air-breathing. This drawing came out of theAustralian magazine Simply Living.Fig. 1-4. Two linear extensions, representing the revolution of Sirius Baround Sirius A. The diagram on the left is based on Dogon drawings; theprojection of the right was calculated by Robert Temple."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17Dogons are very specific about this star. They say it’s very, very old and very small, and that it’s made out of what they calledthe “heaviest matter in the universe” (which is close, but not actually correct). And they say that it takes “close to fifty years” forthis small star to rotate around Sirius. This is detailed stuff. Astronomers were able to validate the existence of Sirius B, a whitedwarf, in 1862, and only about fifteen or twenty years ago could they validate the other information.Now, stars are very much like people, as you will begin to see. They’re alive, and they have personalities and manyqualities like we have. On a scientific level, they have growth stages. They start out as hydrogen suns, like ours, where twohydrogen atoms come together in a fusion reaction to form helium. This process creates all the life and light that’s on thisplanet.As a star further matures, another fusion process begins—the helium process—where three helium atoms come togetherto form carbon. This growth process continues through various stages until it gets all the way up through a particular level of theatomic table, at which point the star has reached the length of its life span. At the end of its life, as far as we know, there are twoprimary things a star can do. New data on pulsars and magnetars give other options. One, it can explode and become asupernova, a huge hydrogen cloud that becomes the womb for hundreds of new baby stars. Two, it can rapidly expand intowhat’s called a red giant, a huge explosion that engulfs all its planets—burns them up and destroys the whole system, thenstays expanded for a long time. Then slowly it will collapse into a tiny old star called a white dwarf.What the scientists found rotating around Sirius was a white dwarf, which corresponded exactly to what the Dogons say.Then science checked to see how much it weighed, to see if it really was the “heaviest matter in the universe.” The originalcomputations—made about twenty years ago—determined that it weighed about 2000 pounds per cubic inch. That wouldcertainly qualify for heavy matter, but science now knows that this was an extremely conservative estimate. The newestestimate is approximately 1.5 million tons per cubic inch! Black holes aside, that would surely seem to be the heaviest matterin the universe. This means that if you had a cubic inch of this white dwarf, which is now called Sirius B, it would weigh about oneand a half million tons, which would go right through anything you set it on. It would head toward the center of the Earth andactually oscillate back and forth across the core for a long time until friction finally stopped it in the very center.In addition, when they checked the rotational pattern of Sirius B around the larger Sirius A, they found it to be 50.1 years.Now, that absolutely could not be a coincidence! It’s just too close, too factual. Yet how did an ancient primitive tribe know suchdetailed information about a star that could be measured only in this century?But that is only part of their information. They also knew about all the other planets in our solar system, including Neptune,Pluto and Uranus, which we have discovered more recently. They knew exactly what these planets look like when you approachthem from space, which we have also only recently learned. They also knew about red and white blood cells, and had all kindsof physiological information about the human body that we’ve recently learned. All this from a “primitive” tribe! ,Naturally, a scientific team was sent over to ask the Dogons how they knew all this. Well, that was probably a big mistakefor these researchers, because if they accepted that the Dogons really have this information, then ^ by default they must accepthow they got it. When they asked, “How did you learn this?” the Dogons replied that the drawings on the walls of their caveshowed them. These drawings show a flying saucer—it looks just like that very familiar shape—coming out of the sky and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18landing on three legs; then it shows the beings in the ship making a big hole in the ground, filling it with water, jumping out of theship into the water, and coming up to the edge of the water. These beings look very much like dolphins; in fact, maybe they weredolphins, but we don’t know for certainfig. Then they started communicating to the Dogons. They described where they camefrom and gave the Dogon tribe all this information.That’s what the Dogons said. The scientists just sat there. Eventually they said, “Nooo, we didn’t hear that.” Because itdidn’t fit into anything they thought they knew, they just kind of hid the information somewhere under a carpet in their minds.Most people, scientists included, just do not know what to do with these kinds of facts. There has been a lot of information likethis that we just don’t know what to do with. Since we can’t find a way to integrate this unusual information with what we alreadythink we know, we just stick it away somewhere—because the theories don’t work, you know, if we keep it.Here’s another thing the Dogons knew. This little drawing was on the walls [Fig. 1 -4], but the scientists didn’t know what theheck it was ... until computers calculated the orbits of Sirius A and Sirius B. As seen from Earth, this pattern shown in the Dogoncave is identical to the pattern made by Sirius B moving around Sirius A—in a specific time frame, which happens to be from theyear 1912 to the year 1990. The dolphins, or whoever those beings were, gave this present-day diagram/time pattern to theDogons at least 700 years ago!Now, as this has unfolded in my life, I’ve discovered that both 1912 and 1990 were very important years. In fact, the periodbetween these two years was probably one of the most important periods ever in the history of the Earth. I’ll explain more aboutthis as we go on, but briefly, in 1912 time-travel experiments began, as did experiments between the extraterrestrial Grays andhumans. (We will explain later.) And 1990 was the first year that the ascension grid for our planet was completed. And manyother events happened during this period. The fact that the Dogon wall drawings pinpointed this period could be consideredclearly prophetic.A TA TA TA TA Trip to Prip to Prip to Prip to Prip to Perererereru and More Dogon Evidenceu and More Dogon Evidenceu and More Dogon Evidenceu and More Dogon Evidenceu and More Dogon EvidenceI first came upon this Dogon information in 1982 or ’83. I found myself around a group of people who were working with theDogon tribe, who were actually going there and communicating with them. Then in 1985 I took a group of people to Peru,including one of these Dogon researchers. We checked into a plush hotel in Cuzco called the Hotel San Agustin, intending to gowalking the following day on the Inca Trail, about forty miles over the mountain tops. You walk up to about 14,000 feet, then dropdown to Machu Picchu about 5000 feet below. It’s beautiful.Our hotel was a Spanish adobe palace hidden behind high walls in the center of town. We were paired off so we could getcheaper rates. I was with the Dogon researcher, and he was constantly telling me about what they were learning, including a lotmore than we’re discussing here. We got a room, and the room number was 23. He got all excited and exclaimed, “Room 23!—a very auspicious number!” From Africa, where the Dogons live, the star Sirius disappears below the horizon and is out of sightfor a couple of months; then it appears again on the morning of July 23, when it rises about one minute before the Sun. Itappears, bright ruby-red, just above the horizon, almost exactly due east. Sixty seconds later the Sun emerges. So you can see"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19Sirius for just a moment, then it’s gone. This is called the heliacal rising of Sirius,which was a very important moment for most of the ancient world, not just for theDogons and Egypt.This is the moment when Sirius and the Sun and the Earth are in a straight lineacross space. In Egypt, almost all the temples were aligned with this line, includingthe gaze of the Sphinx. Many of the temples had a tiny hole in the wall somewhere;then there would be another tiny hole through another wall, then through anotherwall and another, going into some dim inner chamber. In that chamber there wouldbe something like a cube or Golden Mean rectangle of granite sitting in the middleof the room with a little mark on it. At the moment of the heliacal rising of Sirius, aruby-red light would strike the altar for a few seconds, which would begin their newyear and the first day of the ancient Sothic calendar of Egypt.Anyway, here we were in Peru, getting the room and remarking about the num-ber 23. We walked into the room and set our things down; then we both looked atthe bed, and on the bedspread we saw this image [Fig. 1-5].We just stood there in amazement, looking at it for about five minutes beforewe could even speak, because the wheels in our heads were going around so fast,trying to figure out how this could be.If you look again at the image of the beings who got out of the flying saucer,they looked very similar. They were half in and half out of water—air-breathing mam-mals—and their tail fins were horizontal, not vertical like fish. The only sea crea-tures with such fins are cetaceans such as dolphins and whales.But the Dogon image is from Africa ... and here we were in Peru, staring at avery similar-looking mammal. This just didn’t compute. So we asked the hotel per-sonnel, “What do you know about this emblem?” They didn’t know much. They weremostly of Spanish descent and weren’t tied much into Indian legends. They didn’tknow the old stories of creation, so they had no idea what it meant. Here’s a pictureof the whole insignia [Fig. 1-6]:In order to find out more, we rented a little car and drove around the areaasking other people. We finally ended up at Lake Titicaca, talking to some UrosIndians. At one point I asked, “What do you know about this?” They said, “Oh,yeah,” and proceeded to tell me a story that sounded very much like what the Dogonshad told! This is their creation story: A flying saucer came out of the sky and landedin Lake Titicaca on the Island of the Sun. These dolphinlike creatures jumped intoFig. 1-5.

It was this connection with the Sky People, according to the story, that launched the Incan empire.I just sat there with my mouth open. Afterward, Simply Living magazine out of Australia published a whole series of articleson this subject. When people started investigating, they found that cultures all over the world have similar stories. There aretwelve different cultures in the Mediterranean alone that tell a similar story.We’ll come back to the dolphins a lot in this work because it seems they played a huge role in the unfoldment of conscious-ness on this planet.A Sanskrit PA Sanskrit PA Sanskrit PA Sanskrit PA Sanskrit Poem and Pioem and Pioem and Pioem and Pioem and PiLet’s look at something totally different now to suggest that the ancient beings of this world were perhaps more evolvedthan we give them credit for. Figure 1-7 is a phonetic translation of a Sanskrit poem. It was shown in an article published inClarion Call magazine, in the early eighties, I believe. The English translation is shown below the Sanskrit.Fig. 1-7. From Clarion Call magazine:“Mathematics and the Spiritual Dimension” by David Osborn.Over many years researchers have discovered that each one of these Sanskritsounds corresponds to a numerical value. It took them a long time to figure this out.Figure 1-8 shows all the various sounds that are possible in Sanskrit. Each soundhas a numerical value from zero to nine, and some syllables have two number val-ues. For instance, ka, a primary sound, translates as spirit and corresponds to eitherzero or one, depending on its usage, I assume.When researchers took these different sound values and applied them to thisparticular poem, a mathematical figure came up that is extremely significant:0.3141592653589 . . . continuing out to thirty-two digits. This is the exact number of pidivided by ten carried to thirty-two digits!

If you move the decimal point one digit to the right, then it would be 3.1415etc., the diameter of a circle divided into its circumference. Well, they might have known about the diameter of a circle dividedinto its circumference, but in our culture’s understanding of who these ancients were, there is no possibility that they could havecalculated it with that kind of accuracy. Yet here is undeniable evidence.There are many, many of these poems and many, many other writings in Sanskrit. I don’t know how far they’ve come indeciphering all of it, but I think that when all is said and done, it’s going to be pretty remarkable.How did they do that? Who were these people, really? Is it possible that our understanding of them is not exactly correct?Were they maybe a little more advanced than we thought? This poem definitely suggests this.How Old Is the Sphinx?How Old Is the Sphinx?How Old Is the Sphinx?How Old Is the Sphinx?How Old Is the Sphinx?The following is also probably one of the most important discoveries on the planet ever. It’s happening right now at thismoment. However, it began about fortyyears ago with R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz.He’s a famous self-educated Egyptian ar-chaeologist who has written many books.He and his stepdaughter, Lucie Lamy, havedemonstrated a profound understanding ofsacred geometry and the Egyptian culture.While observing the Sphinx, Schwallerde Lubicz became especially interested inthe tremendous wear on its surface. To-ward the back of the Sphinx there are wearpatterns that cut twelve feet deep into itssurface, and this type of wear pattern istotally different from the patterns on otherbuildings in Egypt [Fig. 1-9]. The wear pat-terns on other buildings, supposedly builtat the same time, are textured by sand andwind, which is consistent if the buildingsare, as believed, around 4000 years old.But the wear patterns on the Sphinx looklike they’ve been smoothed with water. Ac-cording to mainstream thought, the Sphinx,the Great Pyramid and other associatedFig. 1-9. Sphinx"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22buildings were built about 4500 years ago in the Fourth Dynasty under Cheops.When this discrepancy was brought up to Egyptian archaeologists, theyrefused to listen. This went on for about forty years. Other people noticed it,but the Egyptians simply would not admit the obvious. Then a man namedJohn Anthony West became interested. He has written many books on Egypt,including Serpent in the Sky and a fine Egyptian guidebook. When he heardabout the Sphinx dispute, he went to look for himself. He could see that thewear was incredibly excessive and that it did look like water had caused thewear. He also found, like Schwaller de Lubicz, that he could not get the ac-credited archaeologists to listen to his beliefs about the Sphinx.There’s a reason for this denial, I believe. Please understand, I am nottrying to discredit a major religion. I am merely reporting. You see, there arearound 5000 Egyptian archaeologists in the world, and they all pretty muchagree with each other in most ways. This agreement has become a tradition.They make little changes, but not too many (and not too fast, either), andmost agree on the age of the pyramids. All of these archaeologists are Mus-lim, with a few exceptions, and their holy book is the Koran. The Koran, in itstraditional interpretation, says that creation began about 6000 years ago. Soif a Muslim were to say that a building is 8000 years old, he would be disputing their bible. They cannot do that, they simplycannot, so they won’t even talk about it, won’t even discuss it.If you say that anything is more than 6000 years old, they will not agree. They will do anything to protect their belief, makingsure that no one knows about any man-made objects that might be more than 6000 years old. For instance, they’ve enclosedthe pyramids of the First Dynasty, which are older than Saqqara, and built military fortifications around and within the walls sonobody can get to them. Why? Because they are older than or close to 6000 years. So John Anthony West stepped outside theEgyptian archaeology world and brought in an American geologist named Robert Schoch, who did a computer analysis thatgave a totally different, scientific point of view. Lo and behold, beyond any doubt at all, the Sphinx does have water wearpatterns—and in a desert that’s at least 7000 years old, it puts it well over the age of 6000 years.On top of that, computers have calculated that it would take a minimum of 1000 years of continuous, torrential rainsdumped on the Sphinx— nonstop for twenty-four hours a day—to cause that kind wear. This means the Sphinx has to be atleast 8000 years old minimum. Because it’s not likely that it bucketed rain nonstop for 1000 years, they figured that it’s got to beat least 10- to 15,000 years old, maybe a lot older. When this evidence gets out to the world, it will be one of the most powerfulrevelations on this planet in a very, very long time. It’s going to have a bigger effect on the world’s view of itself than probablyany other discovery. This evidence has not entered the schools or general knowledge yet, though it has gone all around theplanet. It has been looked at and checked out and thought about and argued over, and in the end most scientists have agreed"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"23that it cannot be doubted.So the age of the Sphinx has now been put back to at least 10,000 years, maybe 15,000 or a lot more, and it’s alreadychanging the entire worldview of the people on the cutting edge of archaeology. You see, judging by everything we presentlythink we know, the oldest civilized people in the world were the Sumerians, and they go back to approximately 3800 B.C. Beforethat, conventional knowledge says there was nothing but hairy barbarians—no civilization at all anywhere on the whole planet.But now we have something man-made and civilized that’s 10,000 to 15,000 years old. That changes everything!In the past, when something new like this is discovered that has a major influence on the viewpoint of the world, ittakes about a hundred years for it to get to the people, for the average person to say, “Oh, yes, that is true!” But this timeit’ll happen a lot quicker because of television, computers, the Internet and the way things are today. Now scientificcircles, for the first time ever, are actually beginning to look at the words of Plato in a new light when he talked aboutanother culture, another continent, from a dim past called Atlantis.The Sphinx is the largest sculpture on the planet. It was not done by hairy barbarians, but by a very sophisticatedculture. And it was not done by anybody we now know here on Earth. From a scientific point of view, this is the first solidevidence to be accepted about the true age of civilization. There has been lots of other evidence, but people just keptputting it under the table. This information on the Sphinx has made a crack in our worldview. This took place about 1990,and the crack is now widening. We now have the accepted evidence that there absolutely had to have been someone onEarth who was highly civilized as early as 10,000 years ago. You can see how that’s going to completely change our viewof who we think we are.Edgar Cayce, the Sphinx and the Hall of RecordsEdgar Cayce, the Sphinx and the Hall of RecordsEdgar Cayce, the Sphinx and the Hall of RecordsEdgar Cayce, the Sphinx and the Hall of RecordsEdgar Cayce, the Sphinx and the Hall of RecordsI find it extremely interesting that the Sphinx is causing this change, especially in view of what the A.R.E. [Associationfor Research and Enlightenment] has been saying. The A.R.E., a foundation based on teachings of “the sleeping prophet,”Edgar Cayce, says that the Sphinx contains the opening to the Hall of Records. The Hall of Records is an allegedunderground chamber containing physical proof of superior ancient civilizations on Earth.Cayce is a very interesting prophet. He made about 14,000 predictions in his lifetime, and by 1970, 12,000 ofthose predictions had come true and 2,000 were still in the future. And in all those predictions, he made only one tinymistake. Out of 12,000 predictions, that’s incredible. You can almost forgive him for that one mistake: He received aletter from a man in France asking for a health reading, but Cayce mistakenly gave a reading on the inquirer’s twinbrother. That was his only mistake. Every other thing came true exactly as Cayce had predicted—up until 1972.However, after 1972 mistakes began to happen, and I’ll explain why at the right time. (For those who think Cayce’sprediction that Atlantis would rise to the surface before 1970 did not come true, check out the January 1970 issue ofLife magazine. Islands did come to the surface in the area where Cayce said Atlantis was located; some sank again"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24and some are still above water today.)According to Cayce, the right paw of the Sphinx is the opening to the Hall ofRecords. Both Thoth and Cayce have said that there are physical objects hid-den in a room underground near the Sphinx that absolutely prove that therewere advanced cultures on this planet long before us. Thoth says that theseobjects will prove the existence of these advanced cultures as far back as fiveand a half million years. In comparison, our level of culture is but a child to theseancient cultures.In fact, according to Thoth, civilization on this planet actually extends back500 million years, and our very first culture originally came from the stars. Butsomething colossal happened five and a half million years ago that affected theakashic records. I cannot understand how that could even take place, becauseof what I understand the akashic records to be. According to what I know, any-thing that occurs, occurs forever in vibrational form. So I don’t understand howthe akashic records can be destroyed; yet I’m told this is true.Introducing ThothIntroducing ThothIntroducing ThothIntroducing ThothIntroducing ThothWho is Thoth? What you’re seeing in this illustration [Fig. 1-10] is Egyptianhieroglyphics. Everything in the picture is hieroglyph, not just the images at the top.“Hieroglyph” means holy writings. These hieroglyphs are drawn on papyrus, whichwas supposedly the first paper in the world. The person depicted here is a mannamed Thoth, pronounced with a long o. (Some day people say Thawth, but hepronounces it Thoth.) The hieroglyph shows his head as an ibis, a bird. So when-ever you see this man with wide shoulders and a strange-looking bird head, it’s ahieroglyph depicting this particular being, Thoth. He’s holding papyrus reeds be-cause he was the person who introduced writing to the world. The introduction ofwriting was a profoundly important event, probably the most influential act that hasever occurred on this planet in this cycle. It made more changes in our evolutionand consciousness than any other single act in our known history.Thoth is also holding in his left hand something called the ankh, which is thesymbol for eternal life. The ankh is an extremely significant symbol in this work, justas it was one of the primary symbols in Egyptian times. There is an electromagneticenergy field surrounding our bodies shaped like the ankh. The remembrance of it, ac-Fig. 1-10 Hieroglyphs for Thoth"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"25cording to the Egyptian point of view, is the beginning of our returning home to eternal life andtrue freedom, so the ankh is a primary key.All these things are an introduction. I’ll be skipping all over the place, talkingabout many different subjects that won’t seemingly be tied together; then slowly,as we proceed, I’ll bring them all together in one coherent picture.On my second trip to Egypt, I went everywhere looking for this little bird calledan ibis. They supposedly lived in the reeds, so I looked through the reeds with mycamera. I kept looking for one the whole time I was there. I looked from one end ofEgypt to the other but never saw a single ibis. I had to wait until I got back to the Albuquer-que Zoo to take this picture [Fig. 1-11]. They look kind of like short-legged storks with brightpink feathers.Here is Thoth writing [Fig. 1-12]. This is a copy off a wall, and this next photo[Fig. 1-13] is an actual wall sculpture.

According to the conventional version ofhistory, this act took place in Egypt during the time of Saqqara, but I have my doubts. I personally believe that it took placeabout 500 years earlier.

I didn’t ask for it, it just happened. As it turned out, I had almost daily communication on interdimensional levelsfor a number of years with this man Thoth. Now that I understand it more, my personal relationship with Thoth really began whenI was in college at Berkeley.I majored in physics and minored in mathematics until I was just about to receive my diploma. I needed only one morequarter to graduate. I decided I didn’t want the degree, because I had discovered something about physicists that turned me offto the idea of becoming involved in a science that I believed was no science at all. This is all changing now. This in itself couldbe a book, but the why of it is related to the same thing I said about archaeologists. Physicists, just like archaeologists, will turntheir heads away from the truth if it means too much of a change too fast. Perhaps the real truth is that this is human nature. SoI switched to the other side of my brain and started majoring in fine arts. My counselors thought I was nuts. “You’re going to giveup a physics degree?” they asked. But I didn’t need it, didn’t want it. Then to graduate I had to go for two more years majoringin fine arts and art history.Changing majors makes sense now, because when you study the ancient writings, you find out that the ancients perceivedart, science and religion as interwoven, interconnected. So the programming I was putting myself through was appropriate forwhat I’m doing now.Dropping Out to CanadaDropping Out to CanadaDropping Out to CanadaDropping Out to CanadaDropping Out to CanadaI got my degree in 1970. After going through Vietnam and looking at what was happening in our country at that time, I finallysaid, “I’ve had it! This is it! I don’t know how long I’m going to live or what’s going to happen, but I’m just going to be happy anddo what I’ve always wanted to do.” I decided to get away from everything and go live in the mountains like I had always wanted.So I left the United States and went to Canada, not knowing there would be thousands of Vietnam War protesters following mea year later. I married a woman named Renee, and the two of us went into the middle of nowhere and found a little house onKootenay Lake. We were a long way away from anything. You had to walk four miles from the nearest road to get to my house,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"27so we were really isolated.I began to live my life exactly like I had always wanted to live. I had always wanted to see if I could live on nothing, so I gaveit a try. It was a little scary at first, but it got easier as time went on, and pretty soon I became adept at natural living. I lived awonderful and full life on basically no money. After a while I realized, Hey, this is a lot easier than holding a job in a city! I had towork hard for only about three hours a day, then I had the rest of the day off. It was great. I could play music and run around andhave a good old time. And that’s exactly what I did. I had fun. I played music about ten hours a day, with lots of friends who camefrom miles around. Our place had gained quite a reputation by then. We just had fun. In doing this, which is very important to myunderstanding now, I discovered something about myself. It was from this—”returning to my inner child” is how I phrase it thesedays—that my inner child was released, and in that releasing, something happened to me that was the catalyst that led into mylife as it is today.The TThe TThe TThe TThe Two Angels and Where They Led Mewo Angels and Where They Led Mewo Angels and Where They Led Mewo Angels and Where They Led Mewo Angels and Where They Led MeWhile in Vancouver, Canada, we decided that we wanted to know about meditation, so we started studying with a Hinduteacher who lived in the area. My wife and I were very serious about wanting to understand what meditation was about. We hadmade hooded white silk robes to show respect. Then one day, after practicing meditation for about four or five months, two tallangels about ten feet high appeared in our room! They were right there—one was green and one was purple. We could seethrough their transparent bodies, but they were definitely there. We did not expect this to take place, nor did we ask for it. Wewere just following the instructions that our Hindu teacher was giving us. I don’t believe he fully understood either, as he keptasking us many questions. From that moment on my life was never the same. It wasn’t even close.The first words the angels said were, “We are you.” I had no idea what they meant. I said, “You’reme?” Then slowly they began to teach me various things about myself and the world and about thenature of consciousness. Finally my heart completely opened to them. I could feel tremendous lovefrom them, which totally changed my life. Over a period of many years they led me to about seventydifferent teachers. They would actually tell me in meditation the address and the phone number ofthe teacher I was to go see. They would tell me either to call first or just show up at his or her house.So I would do this—and it would always be the right person! Then I would be instructed to stay withthat person for a certain length of time. Sometimes, right in the middle of a particular teaching, theangels would say, “Okay, you’re done. Leave.”I remember when they sent me to Ram Dass. I hung out in his house for about three days,wondering what the heck I was doing there; then one day I went to touch him on the shoulder to saysomething, and I got a zap that practically knocked me to the floor. The angels said, “That’s it. You canleave now.” And I said, “Okay.” Ram Dass and I became friends, but what ever I was supposed to leamfrom him was over within that one second."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28The teachings of Neem Karoli Baba, Ram Dass’s teacher, are very important to me. It was his belief that “the bestform to see God is in every form.” I’ve also been exposed to Yogananda’s work and cherish who he was. Later we’ll betalking about Sri Yukteswar and some of his work. I’ve been intensely involved in almost all the major religions. I’veresisted the Sikhs because I do not believe that military preparation is necessary, but I’ve studied and practiced almost allthe rest of them—Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Taoist, Sufi, Hindu, Tibetan Buddhist. I’ve deeply studied Tao-ism and Sufism—I spent eleven years with Sufism. However, through all this study, the most powerful teachers for me have been theNative Americans. It was the Indians who opened the doorway for all my spiritual growth to take place. They’ve been avery powerful influence in my life. But that’s another story, some of which I’ll give in time.All the world’s religions are speaking of the same Reality. They have different words, different concepts and ideas,but there’s really only one Reality, and there’s only one Spirit moving through all life. There might be different techniquesto get to different states of consciousness, but there’s only what is real, and when you’re there you know it. Whatever youwant to call it—you can give it different names—it’s all the same thing.Alchemy and the FAlchemy and the FAlchemy and the FAlchemy and the FAlchemy and the First Appearance of Thothirst Appearance of Thothirst Appearance of Thothirst Appearance of Thothirst Appearance of ThothAt one point the angels led me to a Canadian man who was an alchemist and who, amongst other things, wasactually turning mercury into gold (though it can also be done from lead, which is more difficult). I studied alchemy for twoyears with him and watched this process with my own eyes. He had a sphere of glass about 18\" in diameter filled with aliquid, and little bubbles of mercury would rise into it. They would go through a series of fluorescent colors and changes,rise to the top, turn into little balls of solid gold, then sink down to the bottom. Then he would collect all these little balls ofgold to use for his spiritual work. He owned an ordinary-looking little house in Burnaby, British Columbia, on an ordinary-looking street. If you drove down the street, his house would look like any of the others. But under his house was a hiddenlaboratory. He had taken the millions of dollars in gold and dug straight down, building a huge complex filled with ev-erything from electron balances to you-name-it so that he could further his work. He didn’t care about money at all. Andof course the purpose in alchemy is not to make gold or money, but to understand the process of how mercury or leadchanges into gold.It’s the process that’s important. Because the process of going from mercury to gold is identical to the process that ahuman follows going from this level of consciousness into Christ consciousness; there is an exact correlation. As amatter of fact, if you were to study all of alchemy, you would have to study every single chemical reaction in existence,because every reaction has a corresponding experiential aspect to something in life. It’s the old “as above, so below”saying. (By the way, Thoth is the man who originally spoke those words when he was known as Hermes in Greece.)At one point I was sitting in front of this alchemist teacher, and we were doing a particular kind of open-eyed medita-tion where we were locking breaths and breathing a certain way. He was sitting about three feet away from me, and wehad been in this meditation for maybe an hour or two, a pretty fair length of time. Then something happened—something"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"29I had never seen before, ever! He kind of went fuzzy, then disappeared right before my eyes! He was just gone. I’ll neverforget it. I sat there for a moment and didn’t know what to do. Then I hesitantly reached over and felt for him. There wasnobody there. I thought, Wow! I was totally in astonishment. It blew my mind (as we would say in the ’60s and ’70s), itdefinitely did! I didn’t know what to do, so I just continued to sit there. Then pretty soon a different person appeared infront of me, somebody completely and absolutely different! It wasn’t even close. My alchemist teacher was about thirty-five years old and this guy was maybe sixty or seventy, and a lot shorter—maybe five feet three or four.He was a little guy, and he looked Egyptian. He had dark skin and his hair was kind of long, but pulled back. He hada clean-shaven face except for a thick beard growing from his chin that was perhaps six inches long and tied in fiveplaces. He was dressed in simple tan-colored cotton clothing with long sleeves and pants and sat cross-legged facingme. After my shock wore off, I just looked into this person’s eyes. There I saw something I hadn’t seen before except inbabies’ eyes. When you look into a little baby’s eyes, you know how easy it is because there’s nothing going on, nojudgment, no nothing. You can just fall into their eyes, and they’ll fall into yours. Well, that’s what it was like to look at thisman. There were just these big baby eyes in this old body. He didn’t have anything going on. I had an instant connectionwith this person, and there were no barriers. He touched my heart like no one had ever done before.Then he asked me a question. He said there were three missing atoms in the universe, and did I know where theywere? I had no idea what he meant, so I said, “Well, no.” Then he gave me an experience, which I’m not going todescribe, that sent me way back in time to the beginning of creation and brought me forward again. It was a veryinteresting out-of-body experience. When I came back, I understood what he meant about the three missing atoms—atleast I thought I did. And I said, “Well, I think what you mean is this,” and proceeded to tell him what I thought. When Ifinished, he just smiled, bowed and disappeared. A little later my alchemist teacher reappeared. My teacher didn’t knowthe change had taken place. Everything that happened seemed to be only in my experience.I went away from that totally preoccupied with the experience. At the time, the angels had me working with four otherteachers, so I was going from one to the next to the next, and my life was really full. But I couldn’t think about anythingexcept this little man who had appeared to me. I never asked him who he was, and he didn’t return. Time went on, andfinally the experience started to fade away. But I always carried the question, who was that guy? Why did he have me golook for those three atoms, and what was this all about? I had a longing to see him again, because he was the purestperson I had ever met—ever. Twelve years later I found out who he was. It was Thoth. On November 1, 1984, hereappeared in my life ... and taught me so much. But again, that’s another story for later.Thoth the AtlanteanThoth the AtlanteanThoth the AtlanteanThoth the AtlanteanThoth the AtlanteanThis man, Thoth of Egypt, goes almost all the way back to the beginning of Atlantis. He figured out, 52,000 years ago,how to stay conscious in one body continuously without dying, and he has remained in his original body since then—until1991, when he moved into a new way of being far beyond our understanding. He lived through most of the period of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30Fig. 1-14. Shesat, Thoth’s wifeAtlantis and even became king of Atlantis for a period of 16,000 years. During those times he was called Chiquetet ArlichVomalites. His name was actually Arlich Vomalites, and Chiquetet was a title that meant “the seeker of wisdom,” becausehe really wanted to be what wisdom was. After Atlantis sank (we will discuss this subject in great detail soon), ArlichVomalites and other advanced beings had to wait for about 6000 years before they could begin to reestablish civilization.When Egypt began to come to life, he stepped forward and called himself Thoth, keeping that name all through thetime of Egypt. When Egypt died, it was Thoth who started the next major culture, which was Greece. Our history bookssay that Pythagoras was the father of Greece and that it was from and through the Pythagorean school that Greeceunfolded and from Greece that our present civilization emerged. Pythagoras says in his own writings that Thoth took himby the hand, led him under the Great Pyramid and taught him all the geometries and the nature of the Reality. OnceGreece was born through Pythagoras, Thoth then stepped into that culture in the same body he had during the timeofAtlantis and called himself Hermes. So it is written, Arlich Vomalites, Thoth and Hermes are the same person. Truestory? Read The Emerald Tablets, written 2000 years ago by Hermes.Since that time he’s had many other names, but I still call him Thoth. Hecame back into my life in 1984 and worked with me just about every day until1991. He’d come in and spend maybe four to eight hours a day teaching meabout so many things. This is where the largest body of the information I’ll besharing with you came from, though it correlates with other information and hasbeen substantiated by many other teachers.The history of the world, especially, came from him. You see, while in Egypt,where he was called the Scribe, he wrote down everything that took place. Hewas the perfect person for it, right? He was constantly alive, so as a scribe hewould just sit there and watch life go by. He was a good impartial witness, as thatwas a major part of his understanding of wisdom. He seldom talked or actedexcept when he knew that it was in divine order. Eventually Thoth discoveredhow to leave Earth. He would go to another planet where there was life and justsit there and watch. He would never interfere, wouldn’t say a single word. He’dbe absolutely silent and just watch —just to see how they lived their lives, to getwisdom, to understand—for maybe a hundred years on each planet. Then hewould go somewhere else and watch.Altogether, Thoth was gone from Earth for about 2000 years studying otherlife forms. But he considers himself an Earth person. Of course, we have allcome from somewhere else at one point or another in the game of life, becausethe Earth is not that old. It’s only about five billion years old, and spirit is forever,always has been and always will be. You always have been and always will be."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"31Spirit cannot die, and any other understanding is just an illusion. But Thoth considers himself from here because it washere that he made the first step that led him into immortality.This is Thoth’s wife, Shesat [Fig. 1-14]. She’s a most extraordinary person—in some ways at least as extraordinaryas Thoth, if not more so. She was the first person to bring me consciously to Earth, which was in, roughly, 1500 B.C. I wasnot physically here, but we had made a conscious link across the dimensions. She connected with me because ofproblems the Egyptians were having within their country that, from her point of view, would eventually affect the wholeworld and the outcome of humanity. We worked very closely together. I still have a very deep love for her and a reallyclose connection, though she’s no longer here. Neither is Thoth. In 1991, together they left this entire octave of universesand stepped over into a completely different kind of experience of life. Their actions are important to us, as you will see.In 1984, Thoth came back into my life, twelve years after my first experience with him while meditating with myalchemy teacher. The first thing he did was to lead me through an initiation in Egypt. He had me travel all over Egypt andperform ceremonies and accept initiations at certain temples. I was asked to enter a particular space under the GreatPyramid, repeat long phrases in the original Atlantean language and enter a state of consciousness where my body wasonly light. I’ll tell that story when it’s time, I promise.Thoth, Geometries and the Flower of LifeThoth, Geometries and the Flower of LifeThoth, Geometries and the Flower of LifeThoth, Geometries and the Flower of LifeThoth, Geometries and the Flower of LifeAfter I had been back from Egypt for three or four months, Thoth came in and said, “I want to see the geometries thatwere given to you by the angels.” The angels had given me the basic information/geometries of how reality is related tospirit, and the angels had taught me the meditation I’m going to give to you. This meditation was one of the first thingsThoth wanted from me. That was the exchange: I received all of his memories and he received the meditation. Hewanted the meditation because it was a lot easier than the method he was using. His way of staying alive for 52,000years was very tenuous—it was like hanging on by a thread. It required him to to spend two hours every day in meditationor he would die. He had to spend one hour with his head to the north and his feet to the south, in a very specificmeditation; then he had to spend another hour in the reverse position doing a different meditation. Then once every fiftyyears, in order to keep his body regenerated, he had to go into what’s called the Halls of Amenti and sit for ten years orso before the Flower of Life. (This is a pure flame of consciousness that resides deep in the womb of the Earth and towhich humanity’s level of consciousness is completely dependent for its very existence. More later on this subject.)Thoth was very interested in this new meditation because what took him two hours to accomplish takes only sixbreaths with the Mer-Ka-Ba meditation. It’s quick, efficient and far more accurate; and its potential is much greater, as itleads into a permanent form of awareness. So Thoth began to give me vast amounts of what he knew. When he wouldappear in my room, we would not speak with words like we’re doing now. We would speak using a combination oftelepathy and holographic images. His thoughts to me were holographic, I guess you would say. But there was evenmore going on than that. If he wanted to describe something to me, I would taste, feel, smell, hear and see his thoughts."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32Fig. 1-15. Flower of LifeHe said he wanted to see what the angels had given me in terms of geometries, so I gave it to him telepathically, witha little ball of light, third eye to third eye. Then he looked at the whole thing, and about five seconds later said that I wasmissing many levels of interconnected information. So for many hours of every day I would si t there making drawingsand figuring out what all this stuff was that we now call sacred geometry.At that time I had no words for this way of seeing. I didn’t know what it was, and in the beginning I had no idea whatit really meant. And I didn’t know anybody else who was aware of it except in the past. I thought I was the only one in thewhole world. But the more I became involved, the more I realized that it’s been going on forever and it’s everywherethroughout the Earth’s history and throughout the universe. He taught me in this way for a long time. Finally we came upwith a single drawing [Fig. 1-15], which he said contains everything—all knowledge, both male and female, no excep-tions. This is the one:I know this is an outrageous statement to make this early in this writing, but this one drawing, according to Thoth,contains within its proportions every single aspect of life there is. It contains every single mathematical formula, every lawof physics, every harmony in music, every biological life form right down to your specific body. It contains every atom,every dimensional level, absolutely everything that’s within waveform universes. (I’ll explain in just a moment aboutwaveform universes.) After he taught me, I understood the above statement; but to just throw out that statement rightnow sounds incredible. God willing, I will prove what I’m saying. Obviously, I cannot prove that this drawing containsevery single aspect of creation, because there are too many things that exist to do thatin one book. But I can show you enough proofs so that you’ll be able to see thatyou can carry it over to everything.Thoth then told me that I would find this image of the Flower of Life inEgypt. There were two times that I doubted him in all the years I workedwith him, and this was one of those times. My little mind went, “Noway!” because I had by now read almost every book there was onEgypt, and I had never seen this anywhere. In my mind I scannedthrough everything I could think of. No, I thought, that symbol is notanywhere in Egypt. But he said I would find it, and then he left. I didn’teven know where to begin to look for it.About two weeks later, I saw my friend Katrina Raphaell, who haswritten, I believe, three books on crystals. She had just returned fromEgypt and was in a grocery store in Taos, New Mexico, when I walkedin. She was standing at the film counter and had just gotten back thephotographs from her most recent trip to Egypt. She had a stack aboutten inches high sitting on the counter and was taking them out, thirty-six at a"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"33time, and stacking them. We started talking, and at one point she said to me,“Oh, by the way, my guiding angel told me that I’m supposed to give you aphotograph as soon as I see you.” I said, “Okay, what is it?” She said, “I don’tknow.” She turned away from the pile and went through it behind her back,pulled one out at random, handed it to me and said, “This is the one I’m sup-posed to give you.”Now, Katrina had no idea of the work I was doing, though we had been friends for acouple years, because I didn’t talk to many people in those days about my work—and Idefinitely had not talked to her. The picture she pulled out was this one—the Flower ofLife on a wall in Egypt [Fig. 1-16]!That particular wall is probably one of the oldest walls in Egypt, in a templethat’s almost 6000 years old, one of the oldest temples on the planet. When I sawthe Flower of Life in that photo, I couldn’t say anything but “wooooowww.” Katrinaasked, “What is that thing, anyway?” All I could say was, “You don’t understand, butwooooowww!”Fig. 1-16.

Figure 2-2 is what the plan looks like.Evidently, when they were digging back into the mountain to build the Seti Itemple, with full knowledge that the third Osirian temple was there, they foundthe older, second Osirian temple between the two. Seti I changed the planfor the newer temple into an L shape to avoid destroying the more an-cient temple. It’s the only L-shaped temple in all of Egypt, whichstrengthens this idea.Some people say that Seti I built the older temple, too. However, theolder one is a completely different construction design and has much largerstone blocks. Most Egyptian archaeologists agree that it is a much oldertemple. It is also lower in elevation than the Seti temple, which gives cre-dence to its age. When Seti I began construction of his new temple, thesecond one looked like a hill. The third temple, the long, rectangular one inthe back, is also dedicated to Osiris, and it is one of the oldest temples inEgypt. Seti I was building his temple on this site because the other (third)temple was very old and he wanted to dedicate a new temple to Osiris.We’ll look at the Seti I temple, then the third one, then the second andoldest one.Fig 2-1.

Tourists usuallynotice that there appears to be a great deal of vandalism on the walls,where a lot of the hieroglyphs, especially ones of the immortals, hadbeen chipped off and destroyed. What they might not notice is that thechipping is in a specific horizontal band, from about eye height up toabout twelve to fifteen feet. There is no chipping above or below that. Ididn’t even notice that when I was there; it just didn’t click. It didn’t clickfor a lot of Egyptian archaeologists either for hundreds of years, untilsomebody finally said, “Hey, the destruction is always in this very spe-cific region.” From that realization, they began to understand that therewas a difference between the region below the destruction and the oneabove.They finally figured out that there are time bands on the walls. Theband from about eye height down to floor level would represent the past;the band from eye height up to about fifteen feet or so would representthe present (the time the temple was built); and higher than that (thesetemples sometimes go up forty feet and more) would tell about what willoccur in the future.The archaeologists then realized that the only people who could haveunderstood this relationship and actuallychipped the hieroglyphs wasthe priesthood of the temple. The priests were the only ones who wouldhave known that they were chipping out only the present. An ordinaryvandal would not have been so precise in selecting only the band representing the present. Besides, the destroyers didnot come in with a sledgehammer; they actually chipped certain things out very carefully.

You can barely see itin this photograph, but itshows many of the com-ponents that are aspectsof what we’re going to bestudying in this course.It was an amazing feeling to look at these drawingsbecause they were so familiar to me, and I knew whatthey meant.

Onthis wall is a drawing, which you can barely see in thisphoto [Fig. 2-14], though we could see it clearly when we were there. It looks like Figure 2-15.It’s a symbol for Christianity, but it originated with a group of Egyptians called Copts, who livedat the time when the Egyptian empire was dying. They later became the very first Christians, if weinclude two other Egyptian groups who were connected with them—the Essenes and the Druids.You might not think that these two other groups had Egyptian roots, but we believe they did.This is a Coptic symbol, and when I saw it, I realized it was probably the Copts who made thesedrawings related to the Flower of Life, not the original builders.

That’s what they’rethinking about or what the purpose is at that moment.Figure 2-18 is another way this symbol is sometimes used—four inter-secting arcs with an outer circle around them.I find this photo very interesting [Fig. 2-19]. You see the fish breathing air.This was done before Christ. It’s Coptic. It has thirteen little notches, or scales, if you want to call them that, and it’sbreathing air. We’ve seen a fish breathing air before, with the Dogons and in Peru. Now here it is in Egypt—and it is seenin other places around the world as well.The Early Church Changes Christian SymbolismThe Early Church Changes Christian SymbolismThe Early Church Changes Christian SymbolismThe Early Church Changes Christian SymbolismThe Early Church Changes Christian SymbolismWhen you go back and really study some of the older writings, you find that there was a big change in the Christianreligion about 200 years after Christ died. In fact, he wasn’t very well known for about 200 years, at which time the GreekOrthodox Church, which was the most influential church of the day, made many changes in the Christian religion. Theydiscarded many beliefs, added others, and changed things around to fit their needs. One thing they changed was anFig. 2-18. AnotherCoptic design.Fig. 2-19.

All the way back to the time of Christ, from everything we’vebeen able to read, Christ was not known as the fish, but as the dolphin. It waschanged from the dolphin to the fish during the Greek Orthodox editing. To-day Jesus is referred to as the fish, and even modem Christians use the fishto represent Christianity. What this means exactly, I don’t know. I can onlyspeculate when we talk about dolphins. In addition, the Greek OrthodoxChurch also removed from the Bible all references to reincarnation, whichpreviously had been fully accepted as part of the Christian religion.The Flower of Life: Sacred GeometrThe Flower of Life: Sacred GeometrThe Flower of Life: Sacred GeometrThe Flower of Life: Sacred GeometrThe Flower of Life: Sacred GeometryyyyyThis image of the Flower of Life [Fig. 2-20] is not only found in Egypt, butall over the world. I’ll show you photographs of it worldwide in volume 2. It’sfound in Ireland, Turkey, England, Israel, Egypt, China, Tibet, Greece and Ja-pan—it’s found everywhere.Almost everywhere around the world it has the same name, which is the Flowerof Life, though elsewhere around the cosmos it has other names. Two of the mainnames would be translated as the Language of Silence and theLanguage of Light. It’s the source of all language. It’s the primallanguage of the universe, pure shape and proportion.It’s called a flower, not just because it looks like a flower,but because it represents the cycle of a fruit tree. The fruit treemakes a little flower, which goes through a metamorphosisand turns into a fruit— a cherry or an apple or something. Thefruit contains within it the seed, which falls to the ground, thengrows into another tree. So there’s a cycle of tree to flower tofruit to seed and back to a tree again, in these five steps. Thisis an absolute miracle. But you know, it just goes right over ourheads. It’s so normal that we simply accept it and don’t thinkmuch about it. The five simple, miraculous steps in this cycleof life actually parallel the geometries of life, which we’ll con-tinue to see all through this work.Fig. 2-20.

Many people have thought that the Tree of Lifeoriginated with the Jews or Hebrews, but it did not. The kabbalah did not originatethe Tree of Life, and there is proof. The Tree of Life does not belong to any cul-ture—not even the Egyptians, who carved the Tree of Life on two sets of threepillars in Egypt at both Kamak and Luxor around 5000 years ago. It’s outside anyrace or religion. It is a pattern that is intimately part of nature. If you go to distantplanets where there is consciousness, I’m sure you’ll find the same image.So if we have a tree, then a flower, then a seed, and if these geometries do in factparallel the five cycles of a fruit tree that we see on Earth, then the source of the treewould have to be perfectly contained within the seed. If we take the images of the Seed of Life andthe Tree of Life and superimpose them, we can see this relationship [Fig. 2-23].See how perfectly they fit? They become like a key, one fitting directly over the other.In addition, if you look at the Tree of Life that was found on Egyptian pillars, you’ll see onemore circle above and one below [Fig. 2-24]. This means there were originally twelvecomponents, and the twelve-component version also fits perfectly over the whole Flowerof Life image. (There is a thirteenth circle to the Tree that can either be there or not.)I’m approaching sacred geometry as though you never heard the words in your life.We’re starting from the very bottom, and we’ll slowly build on this until we get to the placewhere it makes sense. First you can see the synchronicity of the way sacred geometryforms move together and fit perfectly into each other. This is a right-brain way of un-derstanding the special nature of this geometry. As we study more and more complexpatterns, you’ll keep seeing the same kind of amazing relationships moving through ev-erything. The odds of some of these geometrical relationships happening at all is prob-ably a zillion to one, yet you will consistently see these mind-boggling relationships unfold.Fig. 2-23.

Versica piscis with key axes."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"45The Vesica PiscisIn sacred geometry there’s a pattern that looks like this [Fig. 2-25]. It’s formedwhen the centers of two equal-radius circles are placed on each other’s circum-ferences. The area where the two circles intersect forms what’s called a vesicapiscis. This configuration is one of the most predominant and important of allrelationships in sacred geometry, as you’ll begin to see.There are two measurements in the vesica piscis—one that runs throughthe center across the narrow width, and one that connects one point to the oppo-site point through the center—that are keys to a great knowledge within this infor-mation. What many people don’t know is that every line in the Tree of Life, whetherit has 10 or 12 circles, measures out to either the length or the width of a vesicapiscis in the Flower of Life. And they all have Golden Mean proportions. If youlook carefully at the superimposed Tree of Life, you’ll see that every line corre-sponds exactly to either the length or the width ofa vesica piscis. This is the first relationship thatbecame visible as we came out of the Great Void.(The Great Void is another key that will be dis-cussed soon.)Egyptian Wheels and Dimensional TravelThese wheels [Fig. 2-26] are some of the old-est symbols known. So far they’ve been found onlyon the ceilings of certain very old Egyptian tombs.They’re always found in sets of four or eight, andnobody knows what they are. The world’s most fa-mous Egyptian archaeologists don’t have the vagu-est idea what they mean. But to me they’re proofthat the Egyptians knew that the Flower of Life wasmore than just a pretty design and that they knewmost, perhaps even more, of the information thatwill be shared here. In order to understand wherethe wheels are in the Flower of Life, you have toFig. 2-26. Wheel on an Egyptian wall.Fig. 2-27. Wheels; not all eight arevisible here."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46study the tremendous levels of knowledge con-tained within it. You would never get there by justlooking at designs. It’s nothing that you could justhappen on—you’d have to know the ancient se-cret of the Flower of Life.This photo shows most of a set of eight of thesewheels [Fig. 2-27]. The next picture [Fig. 2-28] isvery dark and hard to see details. This is a ceil-ing, and it was pitch black where I took the pic-ture. Walking toward the right along the bottomof the drawing are seven people with animalheads. They’re called neters, or gods, and eachof them has an orangish red oval above its head,which Thoth called the egg of metamorphosis.The neters are concentrated on the time whenwe go through a certain stage of resurrection,which is a rapid biological change into a differ-ent life form. They’re holding an image of thattransition as they’re walking along the line, thensuddenly the line comes to an end and there’s a90-degree shift upward, and they’re walking perpendicular to their first direction.This 90 degrees is a very important part of this work. The 90-degree turn is crucial to understanding how to makeresurrection or ascension real. The dimensional levels are separated by 90 degrees; musical notes are separated by 90degrees; the chakras are separated by 90 degrees—90 degrees keeps coming up over and over again. In fact, in orderfor us to enter into the fourth dimension (or any dimension, for that matter), we must make a 90-degree turn.Probably at this point I need to make sure we have a common understanding about what dimensions are—like thirddimension, fourth dimension, fifth dimension and so forth. What are we talking about? I’m not talk-ing about dimensionsin a normal mathematical sense, as in the three axes or so-called dimensions of space: the x, y and z axes—front toback, left to right and up and down. Some people call these three axes the third dimension and say that time becomesthe fourth dimension. This is not what I’m talking about.Fig. 2-28. Wheels, neters and 90-degree turn at right.

There are probably different con-notations of what I’m talking about too, though most people who study this prettymuch agree. A piano has eight white keys from C to C, which is the familiaroctave, and in between those are the five black keys. The eight white keys andthe five black keys produce all the sharps and flats in what’s called the chro-matic scale, which is thirteen notes (actually twelve notes, with the thirteenthbeginning the next octave). So from one C to the next is really thirteen steps,not just eight.Keeping that in mind, I want to show you the concept of a sine wave. Sinewaves correspond to light (and the electromagnetic spectrum) and the vibra-tion of sound. Figure 2-29 shows some samples. We’re all probably familiarwith this. In the entire Reality we’re in, every single thing is based on sine waves.There are no exceptions I know of except the Void itself and perhaps spirit.Everything in this Reality is sine wave, or cosine, if you want to look at it like that. What makes one thing different fromanother is wavelength and pattern. A wavelength extends from any point on the curve to the point where the entire curvestarts over, as from A to B on the longer wavelength, or from C to D on the shorter wavelengths. If you get into a reallylong wavelength, they look almost like straight lines. For example, your brain waves are about ten to the tenth powercentimeters, and they’re almost like straight lines coming out of your head. Quantum physics or quantum mechanicslooks at everything in the Reality in one of two ways. They don’t know why they can’t look at it in both ways at once,though the geometries tell why if you study them very carefully. You can consider any object, such as this book, as beingmade up of tiny particles like atoms; or you can forget that idea and just look at it as a vibration, a waveform, such aselectromagnetic fields or even sound, if you like. If you look at it as atoms, the laws can be seen to fit that model; if youlook at it as waveforms, the laws can be seen to fit that model.Everything in our world is a waveform (sometimes called pattern, or sine-wave signature) or could even be seen assound. All things—your bodies, planets, absolutely everything—are waveforms. If you choose this particular way oflooking at Reality and superimpose that view over the reality of the harmonics of music (an aspect of sound), we canbegin to talk about different dimensions.Fig. 2-29. Sample sine waves."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48WWWWWavelength Deteravelength Deteravelength Deteravelength Deteravelength Determines Dimensionmines Dimensionmines Dimensionmines Dimensionmines DimensionThe dimensional levels are nothing but differing base-rate wavelengths. The only difference between this dimensionand any other is the length of its basic waveform. It’s just like a television or radio set. When you turn the dial, you pick upa different wavelength. Then you get a different image on your TV screen or a different station on your radio. It’s exactlythe same for dimensional levels. If you were to change the wavelength of your consciousness, and in so doing changeall your body patterns to a wavelength different from this universe, you would literally disappear out of this world andreappear in the one to which you were tuned.This is exactly what the UFOs do when you see them shooting across the sky, if you’ve ever seen one. They shootacross at unbelievable speeds, then make a 90-degree turn and disappear. The people onboard those ships are notbeing carried through space like we are on airplanes. Spaceship passengers are consciously connected psychically tothe vehicle itself, and when they get ready to go into another world, they go into meditation and link all aspects ofthemselves into oneness. Then they make either a 90-degree shift or two 45-degree shifts all at once in their minds,actually taking the whole ship, along with its passengers, into another dimension.This universe—and by that I mean all the stars and atoms going infinitely out and infinitely in forever—has a basewavelength of about 7.23 centimeters. You can pick any spot in this room and go infinitely in or infinitely out forever withinthis particular universe. In a spiritual sense this 7.23-cm wavelength is Om, the Hindu sound of the universe. Everyobject in this universe produces a sound according to its construction. Each object makes a unique sound. If you aver-age the sounds of all the objects in this universe, this third dimension, you would get this 7.23-cm wavelength, and itwould be the true sound of Om for this dimension.This wavelength is also the exact average distance between our eyes, from the center of one pupil to the other—thatis, if you take a hundred people and average them. It’s also the exact average distance from the tip of our chins to the tipof our noses, the distance across our palms and the distance between our chakras, to give a few more examples. This7.23-cm length is located throughout our bodies in various ways because we are emerged within this particular universe,and it is embedded within us.It was Bell Laboratories that discovered this wavelength, not some spiritual person sitting in a cave somewhere.When they first put up the microwave system that went around the United States and pulled the on switch, they foundstatic in their system. You see, Bell Labs just happened to pick for the system’s sending frequency one slightly longerthan seven centimeters. Why they chose that wavelength, I don’t know. They tried to find the static, looked through theirequipment, tried everything they could. First they thought it was coming from inside the Earth. Eventually they looked intothe heavens and found it, and said, “Oh, no, it’s coming from everywhere!” In order to get rid of the static, they didsomething that we as a nation and a planet are still suffering from: They upped the power 50,000 times over what theywould normally need, which created a very powerful field, so that the 7.23-cm wavelength coming from everywherewould not interfere."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"49Dimensions and the Musical ScaleFor reasons such as the above, I believe that 7.23 centimeters is the wavelength of our universe, this third dimen-sion. As you go up into dimensional levels, the wavelength gets shorter and shorter, with higher and higher energy. Asyou go down in dimensional levels, the wavelength gets longer and longer, with lower and lower energy, more and moredense. Just as with a piano, there’s a space between the notes, so that when you hit one note, there’s a very definiteplace where the next note is. In this waveform universe we exist in, there is a very definite place where the next dimen-sional level exists. It’s a specific wavelength relative to this one. Most cultures in the cosmos have this basic understanding ofthe universe, and they know how to move between dimensions. We’ve forgotten it all. God willing, we will remember.Musicians, music theorists and physicists discovered long ago that there are places between the notes called over-tones. Between each step of the chromatic scale there are twelve major overtones. (A group in California has discoveredover 200 minor overtones between each note.)If we show each note in the chromatic scale as a circle, we have thirteen circles [Fig. 2-30]. Each circle represents awhite or black key and the shaded circle at the end would be the thirteenth note that begins the next octave. The blackcircle on this illustration represents the third dimension, our known universe, and the fourth circle, the fourth dimension.The twelve major overtones between any two notes, or dimensions, are a replica of the larger pattern. It’s holographic. Ifyou carry it further, between each overtone you’ll find another twelve overtones that replicate the whole pattern. It goesdown and up literally forever. This is called a geometrical progression, only in harmonics. If you continue to study it, you’llFig. 2-30. An octave between the walls. The black circle represents the third dimension; the shaded circle ends one octave and begins the next."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50find that each of the unique musical scales that have been discovered produces a different octave of experience—moreuniverses to explore! (This is another subject we will come back to.)You’ve probably heard people talk about the 144 dimensions and how the number 144 relates to other spiritual subjects.This is because there are twelve notes in an octave and twelve overtones between each note; and 12 x 12 = 144 dimensionallevels between each octave. To be specific, there are 12 major dimensions and 132 minor dimensions within eachoctave (though in truth the progression goes on forever). This diagram represents one octave. The thirteenth noterepeats, then there’s another octave above that one. There’s an octave of universes below this and an octave above,and it stretches on theoretically forever. So as big and as infinite as this universe seems (which is just an illusion any-way), there are still an infinite number of other ways to express the one Reality, and each dimension is experientiallycompletely different from any other.That’s what much of this teaching is about—reminding us that we hereon Earth are sitting in the third dimension on a planet that is in the process right now of becoming fourth-dimensionaland beyond. The third-dimensional component of this planet is about to be nonexistent for us after a while—we’re goingto be aware of this dimension for only a short time longer. First we’ll go into certain overtones of the fourth dimension.Most people in the higher dimensions who are watching and helping with this process now believe that we’re going tokeep moving on up through higher dimensions quite rapidly.The WThe WThe WThe WThe Wall between Octavesall between Octavesall between Octavesall between Octavesall between OctavesBetween each whole-note universe and between each subspace or overtone universe, there is nothing—no thing,absolutely zip. Each of these spaces is called a void. The void between each dimension is called the duat by Egyptiansor the bardo by Tibetans. Each time you pass from one dimension or overtone into the next, you pass through a void orblackness that’s in between. But certain voids are “blacker” than others, and the blackest of these exist between theoctaves. They’re more powerful than the voids that exist within an octave. Please understand that we are using wordsthat cannot fully explain this concept. This void that exists between octaves can be called the Great Void or the Wall. It’slike a wall you have to pass through to get to a higher octave. God put these voids there in a particular way for certainreasons that will soon become apparent.All of these dimensions are superimposed over each other, and every point in space/time contains them all. Thedoorway to any of them is anywhere. That makes it convenient—you don’t have to go looking for it, you just have toknow how to access it. Although there are certain sacred places in the geometries of our reality here on Earth whereit’s easier to become aware of the various dimensions and overtones—sacred sites, which are nodal points con-nected to the Earth and the heavens (we’ll also talk about them later)—there are also specific places in space thatare tied to the geometries of space.

We’re going to spend a great deal of time toget you to the point where you can see that you do havethis image around your body. Notice especially that there’sa tube running down the center of the body through whichwe can breathe life-force energy, and the two apexes atthe top and bottom of this tube connect the third dimensionto the fourth dimension. You can inhale fourth-dimensionalprana directly through the tube. You could be in a vacuum,a total void, with no air to breathe, and completely survive ifyou could live the principles of this understanding."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52As Richard Hoagland has shown the United Nations and NASA, we are now beginning to scientifically rediscoverthis field. Just as it is shown around Leonardo, it is also around planets, suns and even larger bodies. This couldbecome the standard explanation of how some of these outer planets survive. Why? The planets are radiating off thesurface far more energy than they’re receiving from the Sun, a lot more. Where is it coming from? With this new understand-ing, if Leonardo were a planet instead of a person, the points at the north and south poles would be bringing in hugeamounts of energy from another dimension (or dimensions). Planets literally exist in more than one dimension, and if youcould see the whole Earth in all its glory—the various fields and energies around a planet—you’d be astounded. MotherEarth is far more intricate and complex than we at this dense level can perceive. This channeling of energy is actuallyhow it works for people, too. And the particular dimension (or dimensions) that this energy comes from depends on howwe breathe.On Leonardo’s drawing, the tetrahedron pointing up to the Sun is male. The one pointing down toward the Earth isfemale. We’re going to call the male one a Sun tetrahedron andthe female one an Earth tetrahedron. There are only two sym-metrical ways that a human being can look out of this star-tetra-hedral form with one point of the star above the head and onepoint below the feet and with the alignment of the human bodylooking toward the horizon: For a male body looking out of hisform, his Sun tetrahedron has a point facing forward, and the op-posite flat face is behind him; his Earth tetrahedron has a pointfacing out the back, and the opposite flat face is in front [Fig. 2-32a].For a female body looking out other form, her Sun tetrahe-dron has a flat face forward, and a point facing out the back; andher Earth tetrahedron has a point facing forward, and the oppo-site flat face is behind her [Fig. 2-320].

Innature, the law of opposites appears to be manifesting throughout our reality, such as male and female or hot and cold.In truth, this is incomplete. Actually, every manifestation in our reality has three components. You hear people talk aboutmale and female polarity and about polarity consciousness; that isn’t the full truth. There has never been a polarity in thisreality without a third component, with one rare exception we will talk about in a moment.There is a trinity in almost every situation. Let’s think of some exam’ pies of what we usually call polarity. How aboutblack and white, hot and cold, up and down, male and female and Sun and Earth? For black and white, there’s gray; forhot and cold, there’s warm; for up and down, there’s the middle; for male and female, there’s a child, for the Sun and theEarth (male and female), there’s the Moon (child). Time is also in three components: past, present and future. The mentalrelationship of how we see space is with the x, y, z axes—front and back, left and right, up and down. Even in each ofthese three directions there’s a middle or neutral point, creating three parts.Probably the best example is the fabric of matter itself in this third dimension. Matter is made of three basic particles:protons, electrons and neutrons. On the next higher level of organization from the three basic particles you will findatoms, and on the next lower level, finer particle divisions. In a similar manner, consciousness perceives itself in themiddle between the macrocosm and the microcosm. If you look closely into either level, you will always find threeness.There is a special exception, as there almost always is. It relates to the beginning of things. Primal aspects usually dohave twoness, but they are extremely rare. An example is found in number sequences. Sequences such as 123456789....or 2-4-8-16-32..., or 1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21... —and in fact all sequences known—strangely enough need a minimum of threesuccessive numbers of the sequence in order to calculate the entire sequence, with one exception: the Golden Meanlogarithmic spiral, which needs only two. This is because that spiral is the source of all other sequences. In the samemanner, atoms all have three parts, as mentioned before, with the single exception of the first atom: hydrogen. Hydrogenhas only one proton and one electron; it has no neutron. If it has a neutron, which is the next step up, it is called heavyhydrogen, but the very beginning of matter has only two components.Since we mentioned numbers exhibiting threeness, we might as well bring up color. There are three primary colorsrrom which the three secondary colors are created. This means that the universe as we now know it—all created things—is composed of three primary parts except in its rare primal areas. In addition, the very nature of how the universe isperceived by human consciousness is through the three major ways we just spoke of: time, space and matter, all ofwhich are reflections of the sacred holy trinity."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54An Avalanche of KnowledgeMost people by now are aware that something unusual is going on here on Earth. We are in extremely acceleratedtime, and many events are happening that have never been seen before. There are more people on the planet thanhave ever been known before, and if we continue at the same rate, in a few more years we will double our population toabout eleven or twelve billion people.Regarding our human evolutionary learning curve, the supply of information on the planet is growing far faster thanthe population. Here’s a fact according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. From the time of our oldest known human civiliza-tion, the ancient Sumerians (circa 3800 B.C.), continuing for almost 5800 years until about A.D. 1900, a certain numberof bits of information had been collected, a certain number of so-called facts that were added up to determine preciselyhow many things we knew. Fifty years later, from 1900 to 1950, our knowledge had doubled. That means it took 5800years to learn a certain amount, then it took fifty years to double it—amazing! But then in the next twenty years, by about1970, we doubled it again. It took only ten more years, to about 1980, to double that! Now it’s doubling every few years.Knowledge is coming in like an avalanche. The information was coming so fast in the mid-eighties that NASA couldn’tput it into their computers fast enough. I heard that in approximately 1988 they were eight or nine years behind in simplyentering the incoming data. At the same time this avalanche of knowledge is building up, the computers themselves,which are boosting the acceleration, are about to make a huge change. Approximately every eighteen months comput-ers are doubling both speed and memory. First we came out with the 286, then the 386; then we had the 486, and nowthe 586 is out [this was 1993], which makes the 486 obsolete. We didn’t even know how to use the 486 yet, and here’sthe 586. And we’ve already got the 686 planned. By the turn of the century or soon after-ward, a home computer will beso powerful and fast that it will surpass all of the present (1993) computers of NASA and the Pentagon combined.A single computer will be so fast and powerful that it can actually watch the whole Earth and give constant weatherdata for every square inch of the planet. It will do things that now seem absolutely impossible. And we’re beginning tospeed up our ability to enter the data: Now huge amounts of information are entered directly from other computers andscanners and direct voice. So with this incredible amount of knowledge entering into human consciousness, it becomesobvious that a major change for humankind is being birthed.For thousands of years spiritual information was kept secret. Priests and priestesses of various religions or cultswould give their lives to keep the rest of the world from knowing about one of their secret documents or piece of spiritualknowledge, making sure it remained secret. All the various spiritual groups and religions around the world had theirsecret information. Then suddenly, in the mid-sixties, the veil of secrecy was lifted. In unison, almost all the spiritualgroups of the world opened their archives at the same moment in history. You can browse through books in your neighbor-hood bookstore and see information that has been sealed and guarded for thousands of years. Why? Why now?Life on this planet is accelerating faster and faster and faster, obviously culminating in something new and different,perhaps just out of the reach of our normal imagination. We are always changing. What does this mean for the world?Why is it happening? Better yet, why is it happening now? Why didn’t it happen a thousand years ago?

At exactly 180 degrees op-posite one of the spirals is anotheremerging spiral. I believe there are eightknown forms of galaxies—though all ofthem are functions of each other—andthis is the primary model.For a long time astronomers prettymuch thought that what you saw outthere was it; if you could see it, it wasthere. They were either totally obliviousto the invisible side of Reality, or they didn’t feel it was that important. But the invisible side of our Reality is actually muchgreater than the visible side, and probably more important. In fact, if the full electromagnetic spectrum were a line abouttwo yards long, then visible light, with which we see objects, would be a band about 1/32 of an inch wide. In other words,the visible part of the Reality is far less than one percent of the total—almost nothing. The invisible universe is really ourtrue home.There’s much more. There are things even beyond the electromagnetic spectrum that we’re just beginning to under-stand. For example, they’ve discovered that when an old sun explodes and dies, like the one in the bottom right of thepicture, it seems to occur only in the dark area of the spiral (shown by arrow A), indicating that there is a differencebetween deep space (arrow B) and the inner space between the light spirals. So they’re beginning to realize there’s adistinct difference between the two areas of space as well as between the dark and the light areas of the galaxy. There’ssomething different about the dark areas of the spiral that seems to be related to the light areas.Fig. 2-35. Spiral Galaxy"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"57Our Sirius ConnectionObserving these characteristics of a galactic spiral led to another discovery. Other scientists noticed that as our solarsystem moves through space, it’s not moving in a straight line, but in a helical pattern, a spiral. Well, such a spiral is notpossible unless we are gravitationally connected to an other large body, such as another solar system or somethinglarger. For example, many people think the Moon rotates around the Earth, right? It does not. It never has. The Earth andthe Moon rotate around each other, and there’s a third component between them approximately one-third of the distancefrom the Earth to the Moon, which is the pivotal point, an the Earth and Moon rotate around this point in a helical patternas the also move around the Sun. This happens because the Earth is connecte with a very large body, which is theMoon. Our moon is huge, and it’s caus ing the Earth to move in a particular pattern. And since the entire solar sy tern isspiraling in the same manner through space, then the whole solar sy tern must be gravitationally connected with someother very large body.So astronomers started searching for this body that was pulling on ou solar system. They first narrowed it down to acertain area of the sky tha we were linked with, then they narrowed it down further and further, unti just a few years agothey finally pinned it down to a specific solar system We are linked with the star Sirius—with Sirius A and Sirius B. Our solasystem and the Sirius system are intimately connected through gravitation We move through space together, spiralingaround a common center. Ou fate and the fate of Sirius are intimately connected. We are one system!Ever since scientists have known about the dark area inside a spiraling galaxy being different, they have discoveredthat stars don’t just move ou along the curved arm of a spiral. If someone spun a water hose over hi head and youviewed the scene from above, you would see droplets that ap peared to move in spirals. Can you envision that? Eachindividual drop though, is not moving in a spiral, but is moving radially away in a straighl line from the center; it onlyappears to be moving in spirals. It’s the same way in a galaxy. Each of these stars is actually moving radially away.At the same time the stars are moving radially away from the center, they are also moving, independent of thesystem as a whole, from one arm through the dark light into the white light, orbiting the whole galactic system. It probablytakes billions of years—I don’t know—for one cycle to complete itself.Imagine that Figure 2-36 is a galaxy viewed from above and that the dark color represents the black-light spirals andthe light color represents the white-light spirals. From the edge it looks like a flying saucer. The orbit we make around thecenter of the galaxy has within it a spiral motion similar to a coiled spring. In addition to our solar system, the same spiralmotion is seen between Sirius A and Sirius B [see Fig. 1-4 in chapter 1]. The spiral of the Earth and the Moon, I believe,is different. This spiraling motion of the two Sirian stars just happens to be identical to the geometries of the DNAmolecule, according to an Australian scientist. This makes you suspect that perhaps there’s a relationship in the unfold-ment of things, that events happen according to some kind of larger plan, similar to the unfoldment of a human bodyguided by the information within the DNA.

Theirfindings were presented on January 18, 1997,at the American Astronomical Society. This isa counterrotating field. Not only do galaxieslook like Mer-Ka-ba fields, but they appear tohave the same internal dynamics!

This is why we have four seasons.Within this yearly rotation there’s another very slow wobble, which most people know as the precession of theequinoxes, which takes almost 26,000 years to complete. To be more accurate, it’s about 25,920 years—it depends onwho you read, because everybody comes up with a few years’ difference. There are other wobbles, too. For example,that +23-degree angle to the Sun is not fixed; there’s a wobble of about 40,000 years where it changes about threedegrees—from about 23 to about 26 degrees. Then there’s another wobble inside the little three-degree wobble thatcompletes a cycle about every fourteen months. And they’ve discovered another one that completes about every four-teen years. Now they say they’ve discovered yet another one. If you read the ancient Sanskrit writings, all these wobblesare profoundly important for consciousness on the planet. They’re tied directly to specific events and to the time theseevents happen on the planet—just as our DNA is tied to the various phases in the growth of the human body.For now I just want to look at the main wobble, which is called the precession of the equinoxes [Fig. 2-39]. Thiswobble moves in an oval pattern, and the large oval in Figure 2-40 is the wobble itself. The right end, on the long axis ofthe oval, is called the apogee, which points toward the center of the galaxy. The bottom half of the oval shows when theplanet is heading toward the center of the galaxy, and the top half shows when the planet has come back around and isheading away from the center. This movement away from the center of the galaxy is also called going with the galacticwind. The Sanskrit writings say that the ancient beings—who somehow knew about the precession—say that it’s not atthe far ends of this oval when great change takes place, but slightly after these extreme points are passed—at the pointsindicated by the two small ovals at A and C. Great change takes place at those two points. There are two other pointsFig. 2-39. Procession of the equinoxes (the point atwich the Earth’s celestal equator intersects its ecliptic)is due to the slow rotation of the Earth’s axis around aperpendicular to the ecliptic.Fig. 2-40.

Right now in the 1990s we are positioned at A,the lower small oval, which indicates that this is a time of tre-mendous change.According to the ancient writings, when we reach the up-per small oval at C [Fig. 2-41], moving away from the centerof the galaxy, we begin to fall asleep and keep losing con-sciousness and falling through the dimensional levels untilwe come to the place at the lower small oval, when we startto wake up and begin to move up through the dimensionallevels. We wake up in definite stages until we get to the upper oval again, when we fall asleep again. But this is nota closed pattern, because we’re moving through space. It’s a helical, open-ended pattern like a spring, not a repeat-ing cycle as within a circle. Because of that, each time around we fall asleep a little less than the time before andwake up a little more. A similar cycle occurs on Earth each day. If you look at the Earth from space, it is half dark andhalf light at any moment, and the people on the dark side are pretty much asleep and the people on the light side arepretty much awake. Even though we have day and night, we don’t repeat the same things over and over, buthopefully we wake up and become more conscious each day. Even though we fall asleep and wake up, we keepgoing further each rime. This precession of the equinoxes is just the same, only it’s a much longer cycle.YugasThe Tibetans and the Hindus called these particular time periods yugas, which are simply ages. Each yuga has botha descending and ascending phase, so if you use the Hindu system, the age around the top oval at C is called thedescending satya yuga. Then comes the descending treta yuga, dwapara yuga, and kali yuga at the other end. In the kaliyuga you have both descending and ascending. Then you enter the ascending dwapara and so on. We’re now in theascending dwapara yuga. We’re out of the kali yuga by about 900 years, and right now is the time when amazing thingsare predicted to happen. The world is now rediscovering for itself that these are periods of enormous changes on Earth.This diagram [Fig. 2-42] was made by Sri Yukteswar, Yogananda’s guru. He did this in the late 1800s. Though he did notknow the true time duration of the precession of the equinoxes, he put it at 24,000 years. That was very close, becausemost Hindus had no idea of what they were doing when working with the yugas. (I don’t mean to put them down, but theydidn’t.) You see, when we were coming through the kali yuga, we were in the darkest most-asleep times. Most of thebooks written in the last 2000 years were written by people who were asleep, relatively speaking, and were trying tointerpret books written by people who were much more awake. They didn’t understand what the older books wereFig. 2-41. The four Hindu yugas, ascending and descending."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"61saying. So, as with any book written in the last 2000 years, you’ve got to be a littlebit careful because of the time it was written in. Many Hindu scholars wereputting the precession of the equinoxes at hundreds of thousands of years,and some said one yuga is around 150,000 years. They were wrong andjust did not understand.Yukteswar knew better, but he wasn’t quite right either. What he didin this diagram was to put the different yugas around the outer edge,and on the inside he put the twelve signs of the zodiac, thus showingwhich yugas corresponded with what sign. When he made this chartwe were in Virgo, shown in the bottom left quadrant. At the momentwe’re between Virgo and Leo. Depending on what astrologer you talkto, we’re close to the third eye of the virgin right now and passing intoLeo—that’s physically. That means the planet physically is between Virgoand Leo. But if you look 180 degrees across the heavens, you see thesky moving from Pisces into Aquarius. At this moment we’re right on theline between Pisces and Aquarius, about to head into the Age of Aquarius.But physically it’s a whole different point of view. You need to understand that,because when we look at the works in Egypt, some of their writings don’t makesense without knowing this perspective.ModerModerModerModerModern Vn Vn Vn Vn Views on Piews on Piews on Piews on Piews on Pole Shifole Shifole Shifole Shifole ShiftststststsIn the 1930s, Edgar Cayce was channeling answers for a geologist when, in the middle of a question, Cayce stoppedand said something like, “You know, there’s something a little more important going on with the Earth that maybe youshould know about,” and started talking about how the poles of the Earth are going to shift soon. He said the year it wouldhappen would be the winter of 1998, but things have changed since then in a psychically unpredictable manner. Thepoles still may shift, but then again, they may do it in a way slightly different from Cayce’s prediction. We do have free will,and we can change the fate of the world simply through our being.Edgar Cayce was an extraordinary human. He was a man people listened to when he spoke. The statement byCayce that the poles were going to shift in the near future was almost unbelievable by most of the world. But because itwas Edgar Cayce predicting this outrageous event, scientists and other interested persons began to study the possibility."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62Geologists would not believe his statement because they thought it would probably be millions or hundreds of millions ofyears between pole shifts, that this kind of change took a very long time. But because of Cayce’s prediction, certainscientists began to search anyway. A string of major pieces of evidence came forth that lent tremendous weight to whatCayce was saying, and they have now changed the world’s view on this subject. The scientists suspected that if therewere a change in the physical poles, then there would also be a change in the magnetic poles. One of the ways theydecided to study this possibility was to examine the ancient lava beds of the world. This started taking place, I believe, inthe 1950s or early ’60s. They wanted to study lava beds because (1) they figured there would be tremendous volcanicaction if such a shift took place, and (2) lava has a characteristic that could verify and date previous magnetic pole shifts.Iron Pilings and Core SamplesIron Pilings and Core SamplesIron Pilings and Core SamplesIron Pilings and Core SamplesIron Pilings and Core SamplesIron pilings are found in most lava, and these pilings have a different melting point than the lava itself. The pilingsharden while the lava is still flowing and, being iron, line up with the magnetic poles. Through this observation, geologistscan see exactly where the magnetic poles were at the time the lava hardened. They needed to get samples from onlythree locations to be able to triangulate and know exactly where the magnetic north pole was at the time the pilingshardened. Then, of course, they could radiocarbon-date it, which was the best they could do back in those days. Therewere other approaches to this problem, which we will look at in a moment.So they discovered an earlier magnetic north pole that was not where it is now but a long way away, centered inHawaii. That last shift took place right at the upper oval—a little less than 13,000 years ago. They then did ; another testand found that the poles had shifted before that at the lower oval. This opened up a whole new area of investigation intothe Earth’s magnetics.The Geological Society of America published a summary of findings gathered from ocean-floor core samples (Geol-ogy 11:9, September 1983). The samples were six inches in diameter and eleven feet long, and the researchers ana-lyzed the sediment. They discovered that sometimes the poles simply reverse themselves. The north becomes thesouth and the south becomes the north. This was another thing Edgar Cayce talked about that people had a hard timebelieving. But when they analyzed these core samples, they found it was true. Going back hundreds of millions of years,they discovered a cycle where the magnetic north pole would remain in place for a long time—then in a single day, lessthan 24 hours, magnetic north switched to the south. It stayed that way for a long time, then switched again. But towardthe ends of these long cycles were shorter periods where the magnetic poles would reverse themselves again. This fliphappened every once in a while. And as we come closer into present times, the flips are starting to happen closertogether—from north to south, south to north, and at the same time moving to new locations. This has happened hun-dreds of times over the last several hundred million years. A whole new viewpoint of the Earth’s magnetics, calledgeomagnetics, is beginning to be understood. From space, would this not appear as a pulse?"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"63Pole-Shift TriggersBy now there have been many people trying to figure out what could cause a pole shift. What are the dynamics?What’s the trigger that makes it happen? There’s a book by John White—who’s also an Edgar Cayce advocate—whohas compiled almost all the information in the world on this subject, though he does not mention, I believe, the particularinformation on the last magnetic shift being in Hawaii. His book is called Pole Shift, of course. It’s a very scientific andinteresting book. If you read it, you’ll get an excellent understanding of this subject, which is vast and amazing.There are two main theories right now about what the trigger could be that would cause the poles to move. One ofthem is obvious and the other more subtle. The obvious one is called the Brown theory, named after Hugh AuchinclossBrown, who conceived this idea. His theory is that for some reason the south pole begins to form off-center (which isexactly what’s happening now), then it builds up quite rapidly toward the end of the cycle (which is also exactly what’shappening now), until one day it breaks free from the centrifugal force of the Earth’s rotation. It’s just like any spinningobject: When something is off-center, it throws the whole object off-center and forces it to find a new equilibrium. If theweight of the ice keeps building and building, eventually something’s going to happen. The Earth can’t keep spinning inthe same rotational position. It will find a new pole that is centered. Yet there are some scientists who believe that themass of ice at the South Pole is not enough to trigger a pole shift.As a matter of fact, the ice at the South Pole in some places is over three miles deep and building, especially rapidlyover the last 20 years, faster than ever expected, probably because of the greenhouse effect. And today there are threeenormous volcanoes underneath the icecap that can be seen from our satellites. It’s melting the underside of the icecap,and huge rivers are flowing out from beneath it at this very moment. Perhaps this fact was not entered into the equationby the doubting scientists. If that icecap, which is twice the size of the United States, were to break free, it’s beencalculated that it would move toward the equator at 1700 miles an hour to find balance, according to John White. Thatwould obviously cause some problems here and there. Brown’s theory appears to be happening, but it is not a certainty.However, someone has offered another theory, one which even Albert Einstein considered seriously, that holds apossible answer to the equations that unbelieving scientists have used. His name is Charles Hapgood. He, and otherscientists who worked with him, discovered at least two layers of unusual rock underneath the Earth’s crust which liquefyunder certain conditions. Other scientists have demonstrated this in laboratories where they’ve put the same kind of rockinto a miniature Earth and duplicated the conditions of the inner earth. From this experiment, they found that the surfaceor crust of the Earth can slip over the main mass of the Earth, which continues its rotation as if nothing had happened. It’sa fact. It can happen, but of course we do not know if it will actually happen in real time. They don’t know the specifics ofhow this would work—such as what trigger could cause this slippage. Charles Hapgood wrote two books, Earth’s ShiftingCrust and The Path of the Pole, that will probably eventually change our view of our world dramatically."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64Albert Einstein wrote the foreword to Charles Hapgood’s first book, Earth’s Shifting Crust. I feel it is important enoughto reprint here directly:I frequently receive communications from people who wish to consult me concerning their unpublished ideas. It goes without saying thatthese ideas are very seldom possessed of scientific validity. The very first communication, however, that I received from Mr. Hapgoodelectrified me. His idea is original, of great simplicity, and ¦ if it continues to prove itself ¦ of great importance to everything that is relatedto the history of the earth’s surface.The author has not confined himself to a simple presentation of this idea. He has also set forth, cautiously and comprehensively, theextraordinarily rich material that supports his displacement theory. I think that this rather astonishing, even fascinating, idea deserves theserious attention of anyone who concerns himself with the theory of the earth’s development.It is a given that Albert Einstein was one of the most brilliant humans who has ever lived, yet few geologists even yetbelieve such an outrageous theory. Only in more recent times has proof begun to accumulate that such things could betrue. The same scientific world didn’t believe Mr. Einstein either when he said how much energy was contained within avery small amount of matter.It is my belief that the trigger to the pole shift is connected with the geo-magnetism of the Earth. This would take along time to explain, which I am not prepared to do here at this time. What is known is that for the last 500 years theEarth’s magnetic field has been continually weakening, and in the last few years it has been doing absolutely bizarrethings. According to Gregg Braden in Awakening to Zero Point: The Collective Initiation, the Earth’s magnetic field actu-ally began to weaken about 2000 years ago. Then around 500 years ago, the weakening really began to accelerate.(Could it be 520 years? This would match the Mayan Calendar, which predicted a huge change at that time.) In recenttimes the magnetic field is making unheard of changes.Magnetic Flow ChangesThe idealized lines of magnetic flow [Fig. 2-43] you see coming out in a torusaround the Earth are not what geologists have found. The reality is that the mag-netic lines look rather like straight weaving patterns [Fig. 2-44]. They’re fixed, butthey’re not precise in that idealized kind of way. And there are certain areas wherethey’re stronger and other areas where they’re weaker. These lines normally do notmove, but because the field is getting so weak, they are beginning to move andchange. The birds, animals and fish, and the dolphins and whales and other crea-tures use these magnetic lines for their migration patterns. So if the magnetic lineschange, their migration patterns go off, which is what we’re seeing all over the worldright now.

They’re simply following the mag-netic line they’ve followed for centuries, andthey’re running into land that wasn’t on that linebefore.When these magnetic fields pass throughzero point and completely change—which theymay do very soon—we’ll have another subjectto talk about, about what happens then. You see,we believe your very memory is tied to thosefields. You can’t remember anything withoutthese magnetic fields. In addition, your emo-tional body is tied powerfully to the magneticfields, and if they change, your emotional bodyis radically affected. It’s easy to understand thatthe Moon affects the tides of the world throughthe pull of gravity. We also know that the mag-netic fields of the Earth are slightly affected bythe phases of the Moon. When the Moon is fulland passes overhead, we get a slight bulge andchange in the magnetic field of the Earth. Justlook at what happens in big cities during a full moon. The day before, the day of, and the day after the full moon, we have morerapes and murders and killings and weirdness of this nature than we do for the rest of the entire month. The police blotter of anymajor city will verify that. Why? Because these fields especially affect people who are right on the edge of emotional instability,who are barely able to cope during normal times. They’re right on the edge, then the Moon comes along and moves themagnetic field just a little bit, and the person experiences an emotional dip and does things he or she normally wouldn’t do.So imagine what would happen if the geomagnetic field of the Earth starts destabilizing. I heard in October 1993 fromsomeone who’s involved in aviation that in the last two weeks of September, major landing strips had to recalibrate theirguidance systems because the magnetic fields made a unilateral shift all over the planet. It seemed to be temporary,lasting about two weeks. At that time you might have remembered an incredible emotional outburst within yourself andpeople around you. In my world I’m on the phone with people from all over the world. People were freaking out every-where. That’s why I suspected that maybe what I heard might really be true. If it 15 true, then we are beginning to proceedalmost certainly into the next phase of this work. These breakdowns in the magnetic field of the Earth will begin to comecloser and closer together until there is a total collapse of the field and a shifting of the poles.

Even though what’s happening is unusual, we’ve all beenthrough these kinds of things many, many times before. This is not unusual for you, though most of you have very littlememory of it. When you actually start going through the dimensional shift and get into the feel of it, you’ll say, “Oh, yeah,I remember this now. Here we are, going through this birthing again.” So it’s not a big deal, yet it is.You came from somewhere else when you were born as a baby, right? You came from some other dimension andyou passed through a void and came out through the womb to Earth. You traveled this path before, and we’re about to doa similar kind of thing, only it’s a really unusual one this time. There’s no reason to fear it when you know all of it andremember who you are. In fact, what’s occurring is extremely positive. It’s very, very beautiful.HarHarHarHarHarmonic and Disharmonic and Disharmonic and Disharmonic and Disharmonic and Disharmonic Levels of Consciousnessmonic Levels of Consciousnessmonic Levels of Consciousnessmonic Levels of Consciousnessmonic Levels of ConsciousnessThe Sanskrit literature talks about how when we approach the lower oval at A [in Fig. 2-40] in the precession, webecome aware of electrical energies. We can fly in the sky. We can do many unusual things. The world becomesextremely unstable, and in a single day we get rid of the old way of viewing the world and make a huge transformation inconsciousness. But as we approach this transformation, given the particular level of consciousness we have, we tend todestroy everything we touch. It’s a natural part of who we are. We’re not doing anything wrong; it’s just the way we are.We’re doing it exactly right. We destroy everything, we cause everything to go into disharmony. I’ll be talking about thislater, but I think it would be appropriate to tell you this much now:On Earth, according to Thoth, there are ftve totally different steps or levels of life that each human is going to passthrough. When we reach the fifth level, we will make a transformation that transcends known life itself. That’s the normalpattern. Each one of these levels of consciousness has many aspects that are different from the other levels. First, theyhave different chromosome levels. The first level of human consciousness has 42 + 2 chromosomes; the second levelhas 44+2 chromosomes; the third one has 46 + 2; the fourth, 48 + 2; and finally 50 + 2. Each level of human conscious-ness has a different body height associated with it. (This might sound kind of funny if you’ve never heard it before.)The first level of 42 + 2 has a range of height somewhere between four and maybe six feet. The people who fallinto that category specifically are the Aborigines in Australia, and I believe that certain tribes in Africa and SouthAmerica also do.The second level of consciousness has 44+2 chromosomes, and that’s us. Our band of height is about five to sevenfeet. We’re a little taller than the first group. The third level’s height goes up considerably. The 46+2 chromosome levelinterrupts the Reality through what you could term unity or Christ consciousness. That range of height is from about tento sixteen feet tall.Then there’s another range for the fourth level of consciousness—the 48 + 2s—who have a height of about 30 to 35 feet."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"67The final band, the perfected human, is between 50 and 60 feet tall. They have 52 chromosomes. I suspect that thereason there are 52 cards in a deck is related to those 52 chromosomes of the potential of man. For those of you who areHebrew, you might remember that Metatron, the perfect man—that which we will become—was blue and 55 feet tall.(We’ll talk about this again when we get into the subject of Egypt)There are states between the consciousness levels, like Down syndrome, for example. Down syndrome happenswhen a person transitions from this second level of consciousness, which we are on, into the third level, but didn’t quitemake it. The person didn’t get all the instructions right, and where he almost always fails is in the left-brain instructionalaspect of the chromosomes. A Down syndrome person has 45+2 chromosomes—he got one of them, but not the other.He or she got the emotional one—the heart one—all right. If you know any Down syndrome children, they are pure love,but they don’t understand how to make the transition into the third level of human consciousness. They are still learning.The second and fourth levels of consciousness are disharmonic, and the first, third and fifth levels are harmonic.You’ll understand this when we see it in the geometries. When you look at human consciousness from a geometricalpoint of view, you can see the harmonic levels, and you can see that the disharmonic levels are simply out of balance.That’s where we are right now—out of balance. These disharmonic levels are absolutely necessary. You can’t get fromlevel one to level three without passing through level two. But two is a totally disharmonic consciousness. Does not chaosbring change?Whenever a consciousness gets into the second or fourth level, it knows it can be there for only a short time. Theselevels are used as stepping stones—like a stone in the middle of a river, one you jump on and get off of as soon as youcan to get to the other side. You don’t hang out there, because if you do, you fall in. If we were to hang out here on Eartheven just a little bit longer, we would destroy our planet. We would destroy it by just being who we are.

Although they’re not allow-ing you to know everything, there has been a change in the powers that beIn 1992 the world nations met at an“Earth Summit” in Rio de Janeiro to discussEarth’s environmental problems. The largestgathering of heads of state in the history ofthe world was called because of the danger oflosing our planet. Most of the world came, butthe United States, the largest polluter in theworld [fig. 3], didn’t even want to participate.It was obvious that the political administra-tion felt that money, jobs and the economywere more important than whether the Earthsurvived.Five months later, on November 18, 1992,a document titled “World Scientists’ Warningto Humanity” was released. More than 1600senior scientists from 71 countries,includingover half of all living Nobel Prize winners,signed this document. It was the most alarm-ing warning the world has ever received fromsuch a powerful body of researchers.

Human consciousness is pow-erful. We will know what to do. We are more than the ordinary world knows. Doyou remember?Okay, now let’s talk about the dark side. This is a January 2, 1989, issue ofTime magazine [Fig. 3-1]. In 1988 the secret government of the world decidedto allow us to know some of what was going on around environmental prob-lems. This was the first major publication on the subject in the world. Time maga-zine declared the Earth to be the “planet of the year.” Instead of featuring a manor woman of the year, they broke away from their tradition. The entire magazinewas devoted to our endangered Earth and its problems. If you were to read theproblems as they were presented in 1989 and then read the problems as they’rebeing presented in articles today, you’ll realize that what they gave us in 1989was a ultra-watered-down version of the truth. It wasn’teven close. But at least it was a beginning forour world to see the truth about what wehave done to Mother Earth.We’re going to discussonly four or five differ-ent problemsgreat credibility and that the world would care-fully listen. It began:“Human beings and the natural world areon a collision course. Human activities inflictharsh and often irreversible damage on theenvironment and on critical resources. If notchecked, many of our current practices put atserious risk the future that we wish for humansociety and the plant and animal kingdoms,and may so alter the living world that it willbe unable to sustain life in the manner thatwe know. Fundamental changes are ur’ gentif we are to avoid the collision our presentcourse will bring about.”The warning document then began to listthe crises: polluted water, oceans, soil, atmo-sphere, diminishing plant and animal speciesand human overpopulation. (More than halfof the life on this planet is now extinct andcontinuing to die.) The words became stem:“No more than one or a few decades re-main before the chance to avert the threatswe now confront will be lost and the prospectsFig. 3 U.S. is by far the bigest polluter on the planet.Fig. 3-1. Allowing the truth to be known"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70the Earth has, though there are multiple different scenarios going on. If any oneof these scenarios were to break down, all life on the planet would eventuallydie. And at the moment they’re all about to break down—it’s just a matter ofwhich one breaks down first. And whenever one system goes, then all the restof them will go eventually, and that’s it, there won’t be any more human life. Itwill be over with, and we’ll end up just like Mars or the dinosaurs.A few years ago, around the turn of this century, there were 30 million spe-cies of life forms on Earth—30 million different species of life. In 1993 therewere about 15 million. It took billions of years to create these life forms, and inless than a blink of an eye, a mere hundred years, half of the life on this dearEarth is dead. Around thirty species a minute are now becoming extinct some-where. If you were to watch this planet from space, it would appear to be dyingvery, very rapidly. Yet we’re going on as though nothing’s happening andeverything’s great. We’re sticking money in the bank and driving our cars andjust wiggling right on. Yet from an honest point of view, we have a real life-and-death problem going on here on Earth, and few people seem to be really seri-ous about it.When they tried to get the entire world to come together in Rio in the early’90s to discuss the worldwide environmental problem, our president didn’t evenwant to go. Why not? Because the problems are so serious that if we were to fixthem, another problem would happen that would be an even more serious prob-lem, from the president’s point of view: We would be plunged into a worldwidefinancial breakdown, after which a large portion of the Earth’s population woulddie from starvation and other problems. In essence, we cannot afford to repairthe environment. On the other side of the coin, can we afford not to?Dying OceansIt was in the August 1, 1988, issue [Fig. 3-2] that Time magazine focused itsattention on the oceans and what was happening there. Jacques Cousteauwrote a book about this around 1978. He was a very respected person, butwhen he wrote this book, he lost credibility in scientific circles because he madea statement that nobody could believe. He founded his statements on purescience, but people simply could not or would not accept the truth. Specifically,Fig. 3-2. Divulgingthe status of ourseas.for humanity im-measurably di-minished. We theundersigned, se-nior members ofthe world’s scien-tific community,hereby warn allhumanity of whatlies agead. Agreat change inour stewardship of the Earth and life on it isrequired if vast human misery is to be avoidedand our global home on this planet is not tobe irretrievably mutilated.”Yet most of the world rejected this state-ment even though it was created by one of themost respected scientific bodies ever as-sembled on Earth. You would think we wouldpause and say, “If this is true, what can we do?Let’s drop everything and do whatever is nec-essary.” But the governments know that if weare to avert this crisis, we must change the waywe live, and that would not be politically com-fortable.

Neverthe-less, it’s still going to be a dead sea if people continue to live the way they do.And the Atlantic Ocean is rapidly doing the same. Maybe it won’t happen in theyear 2000, but it will happen very soon after that. Unless something changesdramatically, it will die—no fish, no dolphins, no life in the Atlantic.We can’t live without the oceans. The bottom of the food chain, the plank-ton, will be gone, and if they go, we go. When we don’t take this seriously, it’slike saying, “Well, I don’t really need my heart.” This is a major component in theecosystem on Earth, and it’s going fast. This is not debatable, this is scientificfact. The only part that is debatable is when. It is really happening. Nobodybelieved it would happen because they just couldn’t accept this truth.New York City, for instance, has pipes that go twenty miles out and dump alltheir human feces into the oceans. They figured, Well, the oceans will take careof it.

It’s now up against and actually coming into the harbor, and theydon’t know what to do about it. It would take more money than New York has tofix it. This is the kind of foresight that we as humans have demonstrated.The human manure approaching New York is an Atlantic Ocean problem.However, the problem is not limited to the Atlantic or the Mediterranean. ThePacific Ocean is Earth’s largest body of water, and it will probably take longer,but it is also having tremendous problems, especially in certain areas.The red tide [Fig. 3-3] is the first deadly sign of the pollution. It’s an algaethat destroys everything that lives underneath it—it kills everything. And thesered tides are beginning to sweep all over, especially around Japan where there’sso much pollution.

This layer that’s slowlyrising and eating the ozone will continue for 15 to 20 years even if we stopeverything today. And it will continue to eat it faster and faster, because we’veused more and more of these chemicals in recent years.” He said, “There won’teven be an ozone layer”—I think he said in ten years. “I see no solution at all.”If we lose our ozone, we’re in big trouble. All the animals of the world will goblind. You won’t be able to go out during daytime without a space-suit on, meaningevery square inch of your body will have to be covered-special UVC gogglesand everything. In a short time the UVC light would eventually kill you. Andwe’re rapidly approaching that. If you don’t think so, read what the Wall StreetJournal reported in January 1993.The Journal was reporting what’s happening in southern Chile, which isclose to the ozone hole at the South Pole. The animals are starting to go blind.The people who live there have thick, dark skin, and they’ve spent all their livesoutside, but now they’re getting burned in the course of everyday living. And it’sspreading north from Chile and starting to happen everywhere. Because of theSwiss cheese aspect of the entire ozone layer, places all over the Earth arebecoming unsafe. You never know where these spots are going to be becausethey move over the face of the Earth from year to year. This ozone problem ishappening now, not tomorrow or later or maybe someday. It’s occurring at thisvery minute. Given another few years, we’re going to be in really serious trouble.Then they found another child with thesame situation, coming out of AIDS and turn-ing on the same 24 codons, becoming immuneto AIDS and other diseases. They found 100,then 10,000. UCLA now believes that 1% ofthe world has made this change. They nowbelieve that 55 million children and adults areno longer human, by DNA definition. Thereare so many people doing this now that sci-ence believes that a new human race is beingborn at this time and that it seems to have comeout of AIDS. It is almost impossible for thesepeople to become sick.It is also interesting that in November1998, it was announced that in 1997, AIDSdropped of f by 47%, which is the biggest dropin history for any major disease. Could this beone of the reasons?FFFFFurururururther, in Crther, in Crther, in Crther, in Crther, in Cracking acking acking acking acking the Bible Code byJeffrey Satinover, when they ran the word“AIDS” into the code, they found all the usualassociated words.

However, there were certain otherwords that did not make sense to thoseresearchers but that only now can be under-stood in the light of the previous information.They found the words, “the end to all diseases.”This is perhaps the single most importantevent in the world today."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76They knew about the ozone problem at least as far back as when Reagan waspresident. When the environmental agencies asked him, “What will we do aboutthis ozone problem?”, Reagan was really flippant about it. He said something like,“Aw, we’ll just issue raincoats and dark sunglasses to solve the problem.” Just likethat, what the heck? We’re talking about our very lives here, our very existence, andthe governments are continuing as though it doesn’t even matter.The Greenhouse Ice AgeThe Greenhouse Ice AgeThe Greenhouse Ice AgeThe Greenhouse Ice AgeThe Greenhouse Ice AgeIn the first seven days in office, President Bush was approached by 700environmental groups—700 of them in unity and agreement. They said to Bush,“We have an even bigger problem than the ozone and theoceans; the biggest problem that we know of is the greenhouseeffect. If the greenhouse effect is not checked very soon, it’sgoing to destroy the planet.” This is what they had agreed onand what they believed was the truth. For a while Gorbachevand the world’s governments were talking about how they weregoing to put space stations up there to monitor the environ-ment and move with responsible action, Gorbachev was gungho on the whole thing. Then I guess they gave up on it, justquit, though they’re still watching these things very carefully.It’s a pretty hopeless situation.Figure 3-7 is a satellite photograph of the oceans takenfrom above Australia. That dark blotch above Australia and NewGuinea reached the hottest ocean I temperature in recordedhistory in 1992. It was 86 degrees Fahrenheit in that spot. That’s86-degree ocean water. If that continues to spread across theequator, it’s going to do exactly what John Hamaker has pre-dicted. If you’re familiar with Hamaker and his theories, he haspowerful evidence that as this water heats up, something verydifferent from a hot planet will happen: it’s going to be a coldone—very, very cold. Dr. Hamaker predicts an ice age descend-ing upon us within a few short years.Fig. 3-7. Hottest ocean in history."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"77I won’t go fully into the dynamics of the so-called greenhouse effect, but an intimate part of it is tied to rocks, mineralsand trees. One average acre of trees holds within it 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide. When trees are cut down, burned orjust die, all that carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere, and when the atmosphere contains a certain level ofcarbon dioxide, it activates the beginning of an ice age. Hamaker found proof that this is what triggered the last few iceages on this planet. He found his evidence primarily from studying core samples taken from ancient lake beds. The coresamples show, by simply looking at the pollen count, that the Earth for millions of years had a cycle of 90,000 years of icefollowed by a temperate period of 10,000 years, followed by 90,000 years of ice, followed by 10,000 temperate years.That particular cycle has been going on for a long, long time.In addition, Hamaker has discovered—and other people have verified it —that the length of time it takes to go froma warm age into an ice age is a mere 20 years! People who have been studying this for a long time believe that we’repossibly now around 16 or 17 years into that 20-year cycle, but of course no one really knows. And they say that when theend of the 20 years or so is reached, [snaps fingers] in a single day, less than 24 hours, it’ll all be over. The clouds willback up over the Earth, the average temperature will drop to about 50 below zero, and most areas of the world won’t seethe Sun again for 90,000 years. If those guys are right, we’ve got only a few more years of sunshine. It’ll keep gettingwarmer and warmer and hotter and hotter until that day hits, then snap! it’ll be all over. I’m not going to give all the detailsofHamaker’s work, but I suggest you do the research yourself if you want to know about it. He has powerful evidence.Study what he has to say. His book is called The Survival of Civilization.Ice Age to Warmth, a Quick SwitchScientists have just discovered another surprise, which has some of them shocked and barely able to believe it.They thought that when an ice age recedes, it would take thousands of years to warm back up again. But they now haveevidence that it takes only three days, says an article written in Time magazine. It takes 20 years to go from warm to coldand three days to go from cold to warm. So the greenhouse effect is a major and serious problem. No one knows theanswer, but what’s scary is that they’re trying to instigate supposed answers that are totally untested. They’re all fightingabout whose answer is the best and who wants to do what—but nobody knows. It’s like the ozone—they’ve got maybe15 different ideas about what to do to fix the ozone, and any one of them might make it better—or worse. No one knowswhat these things are going to do, because we have never done them before. We seem to be willing to experiment onourselves to find out if we’re going to make it or not.Underground Atomic Bombs and CFCsUnderground Atomic Bombs and CFCsUnderground Atomic Bombs and CFCsUnderground Atomic Bombs and CFCsUnderground Atomic Bombs and CFCsOn top of that, all kinds of other problems are occurring. Some things are so scary that governments are afraid to tellyou anything at all.

I know they don’t want me to talk about this, but I don’t think they’ll stop me."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78We’re finding CFCs in the upper atmosphere. Now, “authorities” in the government have been saying that CFCproducts like Freon will float up there because they’re lighter than air. But guess what—and you scientist types can checkthis out: CFCs are not lighter than air, they’re four times heavier than air. They sink, they don’t rise! So how did they getup there? It might have been the 212 aboveground atomic bombs that our governments have blown off in the world.Many people suspect that’s how all those CFCs got up there in the first place, and that it really wasn’t us who causedmost of the problem with our air conditioners. It was the atomic governments o/the world.At one point they all went underground with their bombs, and we thought, That’s okay, they’re bombing under-ground; nothing will happen now. It’s not okay, folks. It’s probably the most dangerous thing that’s going on in theworld today, even more than HAARP, and they’re still doing it. I cannot prove what I am about to say, so do notbelieve it until you can prove it.Adam Trombly, a famous scientist who has accomplished important work in science, has been monitoring the under-ground atomic bombing around the world. He probably knows more about this than any other person in the world—eventhe governments recognize this. Trombly explains what happens when these atomic bombs are exploded underground.The energy doesn’t just sit there; it has to go somewhere, so it goes shooting through the Earth, bouncing off its insides,ripping apart the plates and doing incredible damage as it goes bouncing around like a ping-pong ball. This bouncingeffect inside the Earth continues for about 30 days after the l explosion.Trombly, much like Jacques Cousteau and others, now has a theory that predicts all kinds of things that will hap-pen—and they’re all happening Mm! Things like the Indian Ocean dropping 23 feet over a very short period of time waspredicted by Trombly at least ten years ago—just as Jacques Cousteau had predicted the death of the MediterraneanSea in ten years. Many brilliant people are speaking out their truth, but few people are listening. If Trombly is correct,we’re only a few more atomic bombs away from the whole planet literally splitting apart in little pieces. The governmentsaround the world have been on red alert since about 1991 over the changes happening to the Earth that were predictedby Trombly. They’re scared to death. Yet I believe China just blew up another one—and the U.S. is talking about blowingone up just because China did!Anyway, life goes on.

Actually, there are many other perilous situations (I could go on for hours), but I’ll just give youthis last one about AIDS. I suggest you try to find the Strecker Memorandum material if you haven’t read it or watched the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"79video. The governments are really trying to suppress it. Dr. Strecker made a video memorandum of what he believedhappened around AIDS. He is a brilliant person. He has worked with retroviruses and is an expert on this subject. Heshowed the video on television, and the governments threatened him. They allegedly killed his brother and the senatorwho was sponsoring it. But they didn’t get Strecker—that would have been too obvious, I guess. Dr. Strecker has dis-tributed many of his videos. He got them out to the world, though you don’t hear about it anymore.Dr. Strecker shows on his film how the United Nations was trying to solve an environmental problem. They knew thatthe biggest environmental problem in the entire world was the human population, and at the rate it was going, the worldwould double its population by 2010 or 2012. But because of what the Chinese did, allowing only one child per couple,and other strenuous work around the world, they slowed it down. But they believe that it’s still going to happen. It is nowestimated that somewhere around 2014 the world population will have doubled. If that happens, computer models haveshown that all life on Earth will die or wish they were dead, according to the United Nations, because we can barely keepit together with almost six billion people. Can you imagine what it would be like with II to 12 billion people in the world7There’s just no way, at least under the present system.So, if you were in the United Nations and knew this potential disaster was going to take place and had to make adecision, what would you do? I’m not judging the people who did this—just put yourself in their position of great power.You see that the Earth is coming to a solid wall, that it’s going to be totally destroyed if something is not changed. So theymade a decision—and Dr. Strecker showed the memorandum right on television. The United Nations decided that, ratherthan hit that wall of 11 billion people, right then and there they were going to create a virus or a disease that would killspecifically three-quarters of the people on Earth. In other words, instead of increasing to 11 billion, they wanted to reducethe current population by three-quarters. He showed the ac-population by three-quarters. He showed the actual U.N.document that planned to eliminate three-quarters of the world’s population.Dr. Strecker showed scientifically exactly how the U.N. did it. They took a virus from a sheep and a virus from a cow andblended them together in a certain way to make the AIDS virus. But before they ever distributed it, they also made a cure for it.The governments have the cure right now, according to Dr. Strecker. The people who were doing this—and history will verifythis—were obviously prejudiced, because they singled out two groups: the Blacks and the homosexuals.In Haiti there was an epidemic of hepatitis B moving through the homosexual community, and they all needed to beinjected with the hepatitis B vaccine. So U.N. agents took the AIDS virus, put it in the hepatitis B vaccine and injected itinto everyone. That’s how the virus started, according to Dr. Strecker. The other evidence that this is true is that through-out the rest of the world, the virus was not given exclusively to homosexuals. In Africa, where at least 75 million peoplehave AIDS, the ratio of male to female infection is almost exactly 50-50, from the beginning until now. Only in Haiti, andeventually in the United States, did it spread almost exclusively through the homosexual population. If you look at thefigures for this country, females are now getting AIDS faster than anyone else. Soon nature will balance it out, and you’llsee exactly the same thing you see everywhere else around the world, which is that equal numbers of males and females"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80have AIDS. It isn’t a gay disease at all—it has nothing to do with it. It has to do with the prejudice of the people whocreated it.According to Dr. Strecker, the World Health Organization, which has been instrumental in creating this disease, hasalso been concerned about other diseases—and so have doctors pretty much everywhere. For instance, let’s takecancer: Doctors have been concerned that someday cancer will become contagious, not by pollution or foods or thingslike this, but that it will become airborne or waterborne, like a cold. You’d just walk by somebody with cancer and you’d getit. But the number of different kinds of cancer viruses is so small that the likelihood of that ever happening is pretty slim.It still could happen, but it’s not likely. But for AIDS, there are 9000 to the 4th power or 6,561,000,000,000,000 totallydifferent kinds of AIDS viruses—that’s a huge number. And every time someone gets AIDS, a brand-new virus is created,one that has never been seen before, ever. This means that it’s inevitable, mathematically speaking—it’s just a matter oftime— that AIDS will spread rapidly, just like a cold, throughout the world.There is a story going around that the World Health Organization believes that this rapidly spreading form of AIDSmay have already begun. Around 1990 or 1991 the WHO checked an African tribe of 1400 members, including everyonefrom little babies to old people, who obviously had all different kinds of sexual practices (you know, little babies aren’t intosexual things), and they found that every single member, without exception, had AIDS. That’s when the WHO announcedsecretly that the virus was probably now airborne or waterborne, and that it might eventually spread like wildfire, like acommon cold. There would be a few years’ lag as with any other new disease. If this were to happen, would you knowthat you are safe? You need to know the truth—you are more than you know!A Perspective on Earthly ProblemsIf we were not multidimensional beings, if we were only physical bodies connected to the Earth and had nowhere to go, wewould be in a very serious situation. But because of who we are, what is about to happen on Earth could become a vehicle forenormous growth. Remember, life is a school. Maya is maya!But still, if we realize the incredibly dangerous situation we’re in, we might awaken to who we are. The only reason I’m evensaying these words and not keeping it secret is because we’re like a group of people in a sinking boat. It’s got a big hole in it andthe water’s pouring in. It’s not time to sit there and play games and do business as usual and think along the normal ways ojthinking. If you didn’t know the truth about our environment, you might just go along with your life and not act.I’m not suggesting to act environmentally, though that is not wrong, What I’m much more concerned with is aninternal form of acting, a meditation, a meditation that consciously reconnects you to all life everywhere, It is what theTaoists say: The way to do is to be. There’s nothing wrong with acting externally, but there’s another kind of acting that’srequired here, I believe. It requires a state of mind where we realize the situation, we begin to take it seriously and workin a way where we can make some real changes in our consciousness. This inner thing we need to focus on andunderstand will slowly unfold as we continue. Whoever understands the other side of this coin of life will realize that these"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"81environmental issues are not a real problem when higher consciousness enters into the 3D world, though from a 3Dpoint of view, it does look like the end of life.The History of the WorldWe’re going to open a new subject: the history of the world and how it relates to the present. Each one of thesepieces of the puzzle widens the view. The situation in which we find ourselves in this world didn’t develop at random.Events occurred that we need to remember. Many of us were here in past lives, and we have these memories within us.But that’s beside the point. We need to know exactly what occurred in order to understand how it developed into thissituation today. This history, of course, will not be found in history books, because history books of human “civilization” goback only 6000 years, and we need to go back about 450,000 years to begin.This information was first given to me by Thoth around 1985. Thena after Thoth left in 1991,1 became aware ofZecharia Sitchin, read his works, and found out that Sitchin’s and Thoth’s information were almost perfect fits—so perfectit just couldn’t be a coincidence. It was amazing how close they were. Many things that Thoth had mentioned—such asgiants in Atlantis, which he didn’t explain further—were explained in Sitchin’s books. And many things that Sitchin ap-pears to have overlooked were deeply explained by Thoth. So the combination of these two sources gives a veryinteresting viewpoint. You don’t have to accept this viewpoint; you can just listen to it like a legend, think about it and seeif it’s workable for you. If something doesn’t feel true to you, then of course don’t accept it. But I believe this is as close asI can get to the truth, and I offer it to you. Remember, I had to translate the geometrical and hieroglyphic images of Thothinto English. Something is bound to get lost, but I do feel it is close enough to trigger your memories.First you must realize something about written history. Somebody has to hold the pen and write it down, so writtenhistory is always the viewpoint of the person or people who wrote it. Written history began only in the last 6000 years, butwould that history be the same if it had been written by different people? Consider that in most cases it was the winnersof the wars who wrote the history books. Whoever won a war said, “This is what happened.” The losers didn’t get to putin their two cents. Look at any of the major wars, especially World War II, which was a very emotional war. If Hitler hadwon World War II, our history books would be completely different. We’d be examining a totally different set of “facts.” Wewould be the bad guys, and they would have shown good reason for doing in the Jews etc. But we won, so we wrote itfrom our perspective.Well, everything’s like that all the way through history. Nobody ever talks about this subject, yet it’s obvious. EvenThoth was very aware of this; he said, “I’m giving you my viewpoint. I have watched the centuries go by, but I’m only oneperson. This is what I believe is true, but you must realize that other people may hold different viewpoints on history.” So"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82even he was not saying, “This is it—take it or leave it.” So with that observation, we’ll proceed.Sitchin and SumeriaSitchin and SumeriaSitchin and SumeriaSitchin and SumeriaSitchin and SumeriaI’m going to begin first with Zecharia Sitchin’s work. If you haven’t read his books yet, you have a great treat in storeif you want to read about this firsthand. His primary book is called The 12th Planet, though I recommend two others, TheLost Realms and Genesis Revisited (in that order). He writes about many cities that were described in the Christian Bible,such as Babylon, Akkad and Erech, which for a long time people thought were myths because nobody could prove theirexistence. There wasn’t even the slightest sign that they existed. Then they finally found one city, which led to another,which led to another, which led to another. They eventually found all of the cities mentioned in the Bible.Realize that all these ancient cities have been discovered in the last 120 years or so, most of them more or lessrecently. As they’ve dug down into the layers of these ancient cities, they’ve pulled out thousands of cylindrical clay tabletsupon which the history of Sumer and the history of the Earth is recorded in great detail, going back hundreds of thou-sands of years. Their written language is called cuneiform. What I’ll be telling you is not justSitchin’s interpretation. Many other scholars now know how to read cuneiform, and as theytranslate these works, it’s changing our whole viewpoint of the world, of what we think istrue—just as John Anthony West’s work with the Sphinx is also influencing modern thinkingabout human history.We’ll come back around full circle later to explain how the Sumerians received their infor-mation. The Sumerian records are the oldest written records on the planet, 5800 years old,but they describe things that happened billions of years ago, and in great detail things thathappened after 450,000 years ago. Whether you’re using scientific knowledge or Thoth’s, ourrace is about 200,000 years old. Sitchin says that we’re older than that, maybe 300,000 yearsor so, but the records and Thoth do not say that—and neither do the Melchizedeks. We’vebeen here slightly more than 200,000 years, but there were civilizations on the Earth—longbefore this cycle and long before the Nefilim—that were far more advanced than the Nefilimor anything we’ve seen since. They left without a trace. By the end of this book you’ll under-stand why there was nothing left when they departed. This is the planet’s past. It’s part of whowe are, in a way. We have access to all that information. There’s a component within eachone of us that has all this information recorded. It’s easily accessible, but most of us are justnot aware of it.Normally we give greatest credence to the oldest source of an historical event because itis closer in time than a scribe further removed from the event. These are the oldest writingswe have, with the possible exception of the geometrical language that predates Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"83hieroglyphics. The ancient Sumerians were telling us a story of history that’s very difficult to accept because of ourcertainty that what we now know about the past is correct. The story is so outrageous on so many levels that scientistsare having a very difficult time accepting it even though they know it must be true. It is the oldest source! If it weren’t sooutrageous, we would have accepted it at face value long ago because it came from such an ancient source.On the other hand, if they were crazy, making up stories without any real knowledge, how do we explain that theyknew so many facts about nature that, from our point of view of history, would have been impossible for them to know?For example, not only did the Dogons know about all the outer planets, but so did the Sumerians—from the very begin-ning of their culture! The oldest known culture in the world, the Sumerians, extending back to around 3800 B.C., knewexactly what it looked like to approach our solar system from outer space. They knew about all the outer planets, andcounted them from outer to inner, as though coming in from outside the solar system. Just as the Dogons showed on thecave wall, the Sumerians described the relative sizes of different planets and described them in detail, as if they wereactually passing them in space—what they looked like, the water on them, the color of the clouds. The whole experiencewas described in detail 3800 years B.C.! This is fact. How is this possible? Or is the truth of our beginning unknown to us?Before NASA sent our space probe into outer space past the outer planets, Sitchin sent them a Sumerian descriptionof all the planets viewed from space. And when the satellite reached them one by one, sure enough, the Sumeriandescriptions were exactly right. Another example: They knew of the precession of the equinoxes from the very beginningof their existence as a culture. They knew that the Earth was tilted on its axis at 23 degrees to its orbital plane around theSun and that it rotated in a circle that took approximately 25,920 years to complete. Now, that’s a tough one for a straighthistorian to understand, especially a scientific type who knows that it takes 2160 years of continuous observation of thenight skies to even know that the Earth wobbles. The minimum length of time is 2160 years, yet the Sumerians knewabout it on day one of their civilization.How did they know it? There is so much extraordinary evidence coming out of these clay tablets that it’s not beingabsorbed into the general thinking very quickly. As I was taught in school and understood it, Moses wrote Genesisaround 1250 B.C., which is about 3250 years ago. That’s what I’ve always read. Yet Sumerian tablets exist that werewritten at least 2000 years before Moses lived, and they have the same account as the first chapter of the Bible almostword for word. These tablets even have Adam and Eve and the names of all their sons and daughters, the wholespectrum of events described in Genesis. It was all written down before Moses ever received it. This proves that Moseswas not the author of Genesis. Obviously, this truth will be hard to accept by the Christian community, but it is true. I canunderstand why this knowledge is taking so long to sink into our modern culture, because it’s a huge deviation from theaccepted history of the Earth, and this minor/major truth about Moses is only a tiny part of the whole truth.Tiamat and NibirTiamat and NibirTiamat and NibirTiamat and NibirTiamat and NibiruuuuuEven deeper than any of these exceptional and impossible bits of information they knew (and there is much more) isthe actual story the Sumerians wrote about the beginnings of the human race before Adam and Eve. They’re talking"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84about a time that goes way, way, way back. The story begins several billion years ago when Earth was very young. It wasthen a large planet called Tiamat, and it rotated around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Ancient Earth had a largemoon, which their records say was destined to become a planet itself someday in the future.According to the records, there was one more planet in our solar system that we are only vaguely aware of in thesemodem times. The Babylonians called this planet Marduk, and this name has sort of stuck, but the Sumerian name for itwas Nibiru. It was a huge planet that spun retrograde compared to the other planets. The other planets are in a more orless flat plane moving in one direction, but Nibiru moves in the other direction, and when it comes close to the otherplanets, it passes through the orbit of Mars and Jupiter [Fig. 3-8].They said that it passes through our solar system every 3600years, and when it came, it was usually a big event in our solarsystem. Then it would go way out past the outer planets and dis-appear from our sight. NASA, by the way, has probably found thisplanet. At least it is the most probable possibility. They used twosatellites and located it at an enormous distance from the Sun. It’sdefinitely there, but the Sumerians knew about it thousands ofyears ago! Then, according to the records, as fate would have it,on one orbital pass Nibiru came in so close that one of its moonsstruck Tiamat (our Earth) and tore about half of it off—just rippedthis planet right in half. According to the Sumerian records, thisbig chunk of Tiamat, along with her major moon, got knocked offcourse, went into orbit between Venus and Mars, and becameEarth as we now know it. The other chunk broke into a millionpieces and became what the Sumerian records call “the ham-mered bracelet,” which we call the asteroid belt between Marsand Jupiter. This is another point astronomers have marveled at.How did they know about the asteroid belt, because you can’t seeit with the naked eye?This is how far back the Sumerian records go. The recordscontinue to talk about earlier events, until at one point they tellmore about Nibiru. It was inhabited by conscious beings calledthe Nefilim. The Nefilim are very tall: the females are about 10 to12 feet and the males are about 14 to 16 feet. They’re not immor-tal, but their lifetime is about 360,000 Earth years, according tothe Sumerian records. Then they die.Fig. 3-8. Solar system including Marduk/Nibiru and the remains of Tiamat(asteroid belt and Earth)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"85Nibiru’s Atmosphere ProblemAccording to the Sumerian records, approximately 430,000—perhaps as much as 450,000—years ago the Nefilimstarted having a problem with their planet. It was an atmospheric problem very much like the ozone problem we’rehaving right now. And their scientists decided on a solution similar to what our scientists have considered. Our scientistshave considered putting dust particles into the ozone layer to filter out the Sun’s damaging rays. Nibiru’s orbit takes it sofar away from the Sun that they needed to hold in the heat, so they decided to put gold particles into their higheratmosphere, which would reflect the light and temperature back like a mirror. They planned to get large quantities of gold,pulverize it and suspend it in space above their planet. Yes, it is true that they talked about subjects that seem contempo-rary—ancient humans talking about ETs and sophisticated science. This is not Star Trek or science fiction; it is real. Whatthey said is pretty amazing, and that’s why it’s been so slow coming out into the general public’s knowledge.The Nefilim had the capability of space travel, though they weren’t at that time much further advanced than we areright now, it appears. The Sumerian records show them in theirspaceships with flames coming out the back—rocket ships. Thisis beginning space travel, not sophisticated. In fact, they wereso primitive that they had to wait until Nibiru got near enough toEarth before they could even make the trip between the twoplanets. They couldn’t just take off any old time, but had to waituntil they were close. I believe that since the Nefilim weren’table to leave the solar system, they searched through all theplanets that were here and found that Earth had large quanti-ties of gold. So they sent a team here over 400,000 years agofor one purpose only—to mine gold. The Nefilim who came toEarth were headed by twelve members who were like bosses,about 600 workers who were to actually dig the gold, and about300 who stayed in orbit in their mothership. They first went intothe area of present-day Iraq and began to establish themselvesand build their cities, but that’s not where they mined the gold[Fig. 3-9]. For the gold, they went to a specific valley in south-east Africa. One of the twelve, whose name was Enlil, was theleader of the miners. They went deep into the Earth and duglarge quantities of gold. Then every 3600 years, when Nibiru/Marduk came around, they would shuttle the gold to their homeFig. 3-9. Original Nefilimsettlements and gold mines."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86planet. Then they’d continue their digging while Nibiru traveled its orbit again. According to the Sumerian records, theydug for a very long time, about 100,000 to 150,000 years, and then the Nefilim rebellion took place.I don’t quite agree with Sitchin’s dating on when this happened. He got it, not directly through the Sumerian records,but by calculating how long he thought it should be. He came up with the time of about 300,000 years ago when therebellion took place. I believe it was closer to 200,000 years ago.The Nefilim Rebellion and the Origin of Our RaceSomewhere between 300,000 and 200,000 years ago the Nefilim workers rebelled. The Sumerian records wroteabout this rebellion in great detail. The workers rebelled against their bosses; they did not want to keep digging in themines. You can imagine the workers saying, “We’ve been digging this gold for 150,000 years, and we’re tired of it. We’renot going to do this anymore.” I would probably have lasted about one month.The rebellion presented a problem for the bosses, so the twelve leaders came together to decide what to do. Theydecided to take a certain life form that already existed on this planet, which was, as I understand it, one of the primates.Then they would take the blood of the primates, mix it with clay, then take the sperm of one of the young male Nefilim andmix these elements together. The tablet actually shows them with what looks like chemical flasks, pouring somethingfrom one flask to another to create this new life form. Their plan was to use the DNA of the primates and their own DNAto create a more advanced race than Earth had at that time so that the Nefilim could control this new race for the solepurpose of mining gold.According to the original Sumerian records, we were created to be miners, as slaves to mine gold. That was our onlypurpose. And when they mined all the gold they needed to save their own planet, their intention was to destroy our raceand leave. They weren’t even going to allow us to live. Now, most people hearing that would think, That can’t be us; we’retoo noble for something like that. But that is what the oldest written records on Earth state to be the truth. Remember,Sumerian is the oldest known language in the world, older by far than works such as the Holy Bible and the Koran. It nowappears that the Holy Bible was birthed out of the ashes of Sumer.What science has discovered is almost as interesting. In the exact place where the Sumerian records say we minedgold, archaeologists have found gold mines. These ancient gold mines are dated back as far as 100,000 years. What isreally incredible is that Homo sapiens (that’s us) were mining gold in these mines. Our bones were found there. Thosegold mines had been worked at least 100,000 years ago, and they have dated humans in these mines as early as 20,000years ago. Now, what the heck were we doing mining gold 100,000 years ago? Why did we need gold? It’s a soft metal,not something you could use like certain other metals. It wasn’t found very often in ancient artifacts. So why were wedoing this, and where was it going?"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"87Did Eve Come from the Gold Mines?Then there’s the so-called Eve theory that people have been trying to put down for a long time.Scientists took a certain component in the DNA molecule and overlapped it to show which one came first, and theyfigured out that the first person of humanity lived somewhere between 150- and 250,000 years ago. And that first person,whom they called Eve, happened to come from the exact valley the Sumerians claim that we were mining gold [Fig. 3-10]! Since then one scientist has discarded this theory because there are many other ways to look at the DNA origins.But I still find it remarkable that this theory just happened to point at the same valley where the Sumerian records say itall started.Thoth’s Version of the Origin of Our RaceNow, let’s see how similar Thoth’s version is. He agrees with the Melchizedek tradition that our particular race didn’tstart 350,000 years ago as Sitchin says, but exactly 200,207 years ago (from 1993), or 198,214 years B.C. He said thatthe original people of our race were placed on an island located off the coast of southernAfrica, called Gondwanaland.I don’t know if this is the right shape for Gondwanaland [Fig. 3-11]; it’s not impor-tant, but it was in that area. They were placed here primarily so that they could becontained and not leave. When they evolved enough to be useful to the Nefilim,they were transported to the mining area in Africa and to various other placeswhere they were used to mine gold and perform other services. So this originalrace, our ancestors, developed and evolved there on the island of Gondwanalandfor about 50- to 70,000 years.You can see on this map how the various landmasses could have fit togetherat one time, and this is what scientists now suspect is true. They call this one land-mass, before it divided, Gondwanaland. They got the name from the creation sto-ries of the tribes in western Africa. If you read the various creation stories of thesetribes, they all have different ideas about how creation took place, but one threadruns through all of them exactly the same. They all say they came from the west, froman island off the western shore of Africa, and that it was called Gondwana. They all agree onthat one piece of information, with the one known exception of the Zulus, who claim to have come from space.The Sumerian records actually picture humans as about one-third the height of the Nefilim. The Nefilim were defi-nitely giants compared to us. They were 10 to 16 feet tall, if you believe the records. I don’t see any reason for them to lie.Thoth said that there were giants on the Earth, but he didn’t say who they were or anything more about them. The BibleFig. 3-11. Gondwanaland"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"88says the same thing. Here it is in chapter six of Genesis:“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them”—that’s an important statement, “when men began to multiply” (I’ll talk about that in a moment)— “that the sons of God”(think about that one for a moment; it’s saying the “sons of God” plural) “saw the daughters of men, that they were fair;and they” (the 5om of God) “took them wives of all which they chose. And the Lord said, ‘My spirit shall not always strivewith man, for that he also is flesh’ “ (this indicates that “the Lord” is also flesh), “yet his days shall be an hundred andtwenty years. There were giants in the earth in those days and also after that; when the sons of God came in to thedaughters of men and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.”That part of the Bible has been interpreted in a lot of ways. But when you see it in the light of what the Sumerianrecords are saying, it takes on a completely different aspect, especially when you read the older Bibles that tell what thegiants were called. They were called the “Nephilim” in the Christian Bible, exactly the same-sounding word as the Sumerianrecords give. There are over 900 versions of the Bible in the world, and almost all of them talk about giants, a largepercentage of them specifically calling them the Nefilim.Conceiving the Human RConceiving the Human RConceiving the Human RConceiving the Human RConceiving the Human Race: The Sirian Roleace: The Sirian Roleace: The Sirian Roleace: The Sirian Roleace: The Sirian RoleThoth says there were giants here on Earth. That’s all he said. He didn’t say how they got here or where they camefrom. He said that when our race was created, these giants became our mother. He said that seven of them cametogether, dropped their bodies by consciously dying, and formed a pattern of seven interlocking spheres of conscious-ness, exactly like the Genesis pattern (which you’ll learn about in chapter 5). This merging created a white-blue flame,which the ancients called the Flower of Life, and they placed this flame into the womb of the Earth.The Egyptians call this womb the Halls of Amenti, which is a fourth-dimensional space that’s located third-dimension-ally about a thousand miles under the surface of the Earth and is connected to the Great Pyramid through a fourth-dimensional passageway. One of the primary uses of the Halls of Amenti is for the creation of new races or species.Inside it is a room, based on Fibonacci proportions, made from what appears to be stone, In the middle of the room sitsa cube, and on top of the cube is the flame the Nefilim created. This flame, which is four or five feet tall and about threefeet in diameter, has a whitish blue light. This light is pure prana, pure consciousness, which is the planetary “ovum”created for us to begin this new evolutionary path that we call human.Thoth says that if there’s a mother, there’s got to be a father somewhere. And the nature of the father—the father’ssperm—must come from outside the system or body. So when the Nefilim were setting up their flasks and preparing forthis new race to develop, another race of beings from a far-distant star—from the third planet out from Sirius B—werepreparing to travel to Earth. There were 32 members of this race, 16 males and 16 females who were married into asingle family. They were also giants of the same height as the Nefilim. Though the Nefilim were primarily third-dimen-sional beings, the Sirians were primarily fourth-dimensional."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"89Thirty-two people marrying each other probably sounds strange, too. On Earth, one male and one female marrybecause we’re reflecting the light of our sun. Our sun is a hydrogen sun, which has one proton and one electron. Weduplicate that process of hydrogen, and that’s why we marry the way we do, one on one. If you were to visit planets thathave helium suns, which have two protons, two electrons and two neutrons, then you would find two males and twofemales joining together to make children. When you go to an old sun like Sirius B, which is a white dwarf and highlyevolved, it has a system of 32 (germanium).So the Sirians came here and knew exactly what to do. They entered directly into the womb of the Halls of Amenti,right into the pyramid and before the flame. These beings had the understanding that all things are light. They understoodthe connection between thought and feeling. So they simply created 32 rose-quartz slabs that were about 30 incheshigh, 3 or 4 feet wide and roughly 18 to 20 feet long. They created them out of nothing—absolutely nothing at all—aroundthe flame. Then they lay down on these slabs, alternating male and female, facing upward with their heads toward thecenter around this flame. The Sirians conceived, or merged with the flame or ovum of the Nefilim. On the third-dimen-sional level, the Nefilim scientists placed the laboratory-created human eggs in the wombs of seven Nefilim women, fromwhich the first human being was eventually born. Conception in human terms happens in less than 24 hours—the basicprocess through the first eight cells. But conception on a planetary level is very different. According to Thoth, they laythere without moving for approximately 2000 years, conceiving with the Earth this new race. Finally, after 2000 years, thefirst human beings were born in Gondwanaland, off the western shores of southern Africa.Enlil’s ArEnlil’s ArEnlil’s ArEnlil’s ArEnlil’s ArrivalrivalrivalrivalrivalNow, the part of the story where the Sirians are the father doesn’t seem to completely correlate with what theSumerian records say, at least according to the story given by Zecharia Sitchin, until you look at a sequence of eventsthat Sitchin didn’t seem to understand. Enlil, who was the first one to come to Earth and was the boss in southern Africa—did not land onland when he arrived on Earth. He landed in the waters. Why did he go into the waters? Because that’s where thedolphins and the whales were. The dolphins and whales were the highest level of consciousness on this planet, and stillare. In simple galactic terms, Enlil had to go into the ocean to get permission to live and mine gold on Earth. Why?Because this planet belonged to the dolphins and whales, and it is galactic law that permission must be granted beforean off-planet race can enter into a different consciousness system. According to the Sumerian records, Enlil stayed withthem a very long time, and when he finally decided to come onto land, he was half human and half fish! At one point Enlilbecame all human. This was described in the Sumerian records.You see, the third planet out from Sirius B that some call Oceana happens to be the home planet of the dolphins andwhales. Peter Shenstone, leader of the dolphin movement in Australia, has channeled an unusual book, The Legend ofthe Golden Dolphin, which came from the dolphins and describes exactly how they came from another galaxy, how they"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90came to be on the little star around Sirius B, and how they traveled to Earth. The entire planet there is almost completelywater; there’s an island about the size of Australia and another about the size of California, and that’s all. On those twolandmasses there are human-type beings, but not very many. The rest of the planet, which is all water, is cetacean.There’s a direct connection between the human-type beings and the cetaceans, so when Enlil (a Nefilim) came here, hefirst connected with the dolphins (Sirians) to receive their blessing. Then he went onto the land and began the processthat led to the creation of our race.Nefilim MothersNefilim MothersNefilim MothersNefilim MothersNefilim MothersTo recapitulate and clarify: After the rebellion, when it was decided to create a new race here on Earth, it was theNefilim who became the mother aspect. The Sumerian record says seven females stepped forward. Then the Nefilimtook clay from the earth, blood from the primate and sperm from the young Nefilim male, mixed this together and put itinto the wombs of the young female Nefilim who were chosen for this. They gave birth to human babies. So seven of uswere birthed at once, not just one Adam and Eve, according to the original stories—and we were sterile. We could notreproduce. The Nefilim continued procreating little humans, making an army of little beings—us—putting them on theisland of Gondwanaland. If you want to believe this story, which is part Sumerian record and part Thoth, our race’smother is Nefilim and our father is Sirian. Now, if it were not for the Sumerian records concerning the Nefilim, this wouldall seem absolutely outrageous—and it still does. But there’s a tremendous amount of scientific evidence that this is trueif you read the archaeological records—not about the Sirian father, but definitely about the Nefilim mother.Science doesn’t understand how we got here. You are aware that there’s a “missing link” between the last primateand us. We seem to come out of nowhere. They do know that we’re somewhere between 150- and 250,000 years old,but they have no idea where we came from or how we developed. We just stepped through some mystical doorway andarrived.Adam and EveAdam and EveAdam and EveAdam and EveAdam and EveAnother interesting part of the Sumerian records was that after they mined gold for a while in Africa, the cities in thenorth, near modern-day Iraq, became quite elaborate and extremely beautiful. They were in rain forests and had hugegardens around them. It was finally decided, according to the Sumerian records, to bring some of the slaves from thesouthern mines to the cities to have them work the gardens. Evidently we made great slaves. One day Enlil’s youngerbrother, Enki (whose name means snake), went to Eve—and the records used that name, Eve—and told her that thereason his brother didn’t want the humans to eat of that tree in the center of the garden was because it would make themlike the Nefilim. Enki was trying to get even with his brother for a dispute they were having. (The whole story is much moreinvolved than this, but you can read it in the records.) So Enki convinced Eve to eat of the apple tree, the tree of the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"91knowledge of good and evil, which, according to the records, included more than just a dualistic point of view. It gave herthe power to procreate, to give birth.So Eve found Adam and they ate of this tree and had children, each of which was listed by name on the Sumeriantablets. Now, think about the Adam and Eve story from here on—both stories: the one in Sumerian records and the onein the Bible. God walks through the garden—he’s walking, he’s in a body, in flesh, which was suggested in Genesis. He’swalking through the garden calling for Adam and Eve. He doesn’t know where they are. He’s God, but he doesn’t knowwhere Adam and Eve are. He calls for them and they come. He doesn’t know that they ate of the tree until he sees themtrying to hide themselves because they’re ashamed. Then he realizes what they’ve done.Here’s another thing: The word for God, elohim, in the original Bible— intact, in all the bibles—was not singular butplural. Was the God who created humanity a race of beings? When Enlil found out that Adam and Eve had done this, hewas furious. He especially didn’t want them to eat of the other tree, the tree of life, because then not only would they beable to procreate, but they would become immortal. (We don’t know if these are really trees or not. It might have beensymbolic for something bound to consciousness.) Therefore, at that point Enlil removed Adam and Eve from his garden.He put them somewhere else and monitored them. He had to have monitored them because he wrote down the namesof all the sons and daughters; he knew everything that was going on in the whole family. It was all written down over 2000years before the Bible was ever written.From the time of Adam and Eve, our race developed in two strains: one that could procreate and were free (thoughmonitored), and the other that could not have children and were slaves. According to modern scientists, this latter straincontinued to mine gold until at least 20,000 years ago. The bones of this second strain that were found in the mines wereidentical to ours; the only difference is that they couldn’t have children. This strain was completely destroyed at the timeof the Great Flood, roughly 12,500 years ago. (There is much more to this subject, which we will give to you at the rightmoment.)We will be talking about four Earth pole shifts in this work—when Gondwanaland sank, when Lemuria sank, whenAtlantis sank (which is the Great Flood) and the one that is now about to happen. This side note is important to under-stand: According to Thoth, the degree of tilt of the Earth’s axis and the degree of the pole shift—which happens on apretty regular basis, according to science—have a direct relationship to the change in consciousness on the planet. Forexample, the last time the pole shifted at the time of the Great Flood, the North Pole was in Hawaii (I realize this isdebatable)—at least that’s where the magnetic pole was—and now it’s practically 90 degrees from there. That’s a bigchange. It was not a positive change, but a negative one—we went down in consciousness, not up.The Rising of LemuriaThe Rising of LemuriaThe Rising of LemuriaThe Rising of LemuriaThe Rising of LemuriaAccording to Thoth, after Adam and Eve there was a major shift of the axis, which submerged Gondwanaland. Thothsays that when Gondwanaland went down, another landmass came up in the Pacific Ocean, which we call Lemuria, and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92the descendants of Adam and Eve were taken from their homeland and brought to Lemuria.Figure 3-12 is not exactly what Lemuria looked like, but it’s close in a certain way. Itextended from the Hawaiian Islands all the way down to Easter Island. It was not a solidmass, but a series of thousands of islands that were closely linked. Some of them were big,some of them little, and there were a whole lot more than this picture shows. It was like acontinent that was barely above water—a water continent.Adam’s race was brought there and allowed to develop on its own without the Nefiliminterfering, as far as I know. We remained on Lemuria for 65- to 70,000 years. While wewere on Lemuria, we were very happy. We had few problems. We were accelerating throughour evolutionary path and moving very well. We did lots of experiments on ourselves andimplemented many physical changes to our bodies. We were changing our skeletal struc-ture, working on the base of our spine a great deal, working on our skull size and shape.We were mostly right-brained, feminine in nature. An evolutionary cycle has to choose whether it’s going to be male orfemale, just like you did when you came to Earth. You’ve got to make that decision. So our race was becoming female.By the time Lemuria sank, as a race we were equivalent to about a 12-year-old girl.Explorations of Lemuria in 1910The fact that Lemuria probably existed was established in our society as far back as 1910. We don’t remember muchabout this knowledge, because in 1912 something happened to change our course of evolution. In 1912 experimentstook place that were similar to the Philadelphia Experiment of 1942 and ’43, which we’ll talk about later. They actually didthe experiment in 1913, but it turned out to be a huge catastrophe, and I personally believe that this experiment is whatcaused World War I in 1914. After that we were never the same.Before World War I the spiritual growth pattern of the United States was similar to what’s happening right now. Peoplewere extremely interested in spiritual and psychic work, in meditation, in understanding the ancient past and in everythingelse of that nature. People like Colonel James Churchward and Augustus Le Plongeon from France were studyingAtlantis and Lemuria, and there were many similar thought patterns compared to the present. Then when World War Icame along, we fell asleep and didn’t start waking up again until the 1960s. But the proof they had in 1910 about theexistence of Lemuria was pretty remarkable, and it had to do with coral. Coral can grow underneath the surface of wateronly to a depth of 150 feet. In 1910 I suspect the Pacific floor was higher than it is now, because they were able to seecoral rings on the surface of the ocean floor heading away from Easter Island for a great distance.By the way, the ocean floor does rise and fall. You might not know it, but the Atlantic Ocean floor rose over two milesin December 1969; you can look this up in the January 1970 issue of Life magazine. In the Bermuda area many islandssuddenly began to break the surface. Some are still there, but most of them sank again. The ocean floor had been overFig. 3-12. Lemuria."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"93two miles deep prior to that time.At the time that Plato described Atlantis and the Atlantic Ocean, the Greeks were having a difficult time navigatingtheir ships into the Atlantic Ocean outside the Straits of Gibraltar because the water in that area was only 10 or 15 feetdeep, sometimes even less. Now the water is deep again.The coral rings they discovered in the Pacific were estimated at 1800 feet deep. This meant that the rings originallyhad islands inside, because the coral had to be close to the surface in order to grow. If the rings were 1800 feet deep, itmeant that since coral cannot grow below 150 feet, the rings sank very, very slowly. In 1910 people could see these ringsgoing off into the distance, so they knew there had to be a lot of islands there at one time. Probably more important, if youfollow the fauna and flora from the Hawaiian Islands, you find the same features on a whole series of islands movingalong an arc from Hawaii all the way to Easter Island. These islands are separated by long distances, but if you look ona map, you’ll see a long string. That string used to run along the western shores of Lemuria. All those islands, includingTahiti and Borea, were part of Lemuria. All the islands in this string have exactly the same fauna and flora—not on any ofthe other islands, just this one string—the same trees, same birds, same bees, same bugs, same bacteria, same every-thing. Science can explain this phenomenon only if there were at one time much closer land bridges between theseislands.Ay and Tiya and the Beginning ofTAy and Tiya and the Beginning ofTAy and Tiya and the Beginning ofTAy and Tiya and the Beginning ofTAy and Tiya and the Beginning ofTantraantraantraantraantraThis new civilization in Lemuria was developing quite well; everything was going along just great. But most of Lemuriaeventually sank. About a thousand years before it sank, two people were there whose names were Ay and Tiya. Thiscouple did something that no one else had ever done before, at least in our evolutionary cycle. They discovered that ifyou make love in a certain way and breathe in a certain way, you get different results when you have a child. Through theconception of that different kind of birth, all three of them—the mother, the father and the child—would become immortal.In other words, by having a baby in a certain way, the experience changes you forever.Ay and Tiya suspected that they had become immortal, I’m sure, because of their experience. As time went on andeverybody else started dying but they remained alive, people began to realize that they really did have something. Sothey finally set up a school. As far as I know, it was the first mystery school on the Earth in this cycle. It was called theNaacal, or Naakal (rhymes with McCall), Mystery School, where they simply tried to teach how to do this thing we callresurrection or ascension through tantra. Tantra is a Hindu word for yoga or union with God though sexual practices. (Wehave a lot to go over before we can understand exactly what they were doing.) Anyway, they did this and then they beganto teach other people.Before Lemuria sank, they had instructed approximately a thousand people, which means that about 333 families ofthree each were able to understand what they were doing and demonstrate it. They were able to make love in thisunusual way. They didn’t touch each other, actually. In fact, they didn’t even need to be in the same room. It was"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94interdimensional love-making. They taught others how to do it, and it was get-ting to a place where in another few thousand years they would probably havetranslated the whole race into a new consciousness.But God evidently said no, it was not the right time. They had just gottenstarted when Lemuria sank. Lemuria, like I said, was female, and the Lemurianswere very psychic. They knew that Lemuria was going to sink a long time be-forehand. They knew with absolute certainty; it wasn’t even a matter of discus-sion. So they prepared a long time in advance. They took all their artifacts toLake Titicaca, Mount Shasta and other places. Even the great golden disk ofLemuria was removed. They got everything of value out of the country andprepared for the end. When Lemuria finally sank, they were totally off the is-lands. They had resettled from Lake Titicaca through Central America and Mexicoto as far north as Mount Shasta.Lemuria Sinks and Atlantis RisesAccording to what Thoth says, the sinking of Lemuria and the rising of Atlantisoccurred at the same time, during another shift of the axis. Lemuria went down,and what would be called Atlantis rose.Atlantis was a pretty large continent, as shown here [Fig. 3-13]. The south-eastern part of the United States wasn’t there; Florida, Louisiana, Alabama,Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and parts of Texas were under water. Idon’t know if Atlantis was quite this big or not, but it was pretty big. It actuallyconsisted of this continent plus nine islands: one to the north, one to the east,one to the south and six to the west, which extended to where the Florida Keysare now.Update: On May 23, 1998, Aaron Du Val,president of the Egyptology Society in Miami,Florida, announced that ancient Atlantis hasbeen found near Bimini, and that it can be sci-entifically proven beyond any doubt. They havefound a huge underwater pyramid and haveopen hermetically sealed chambers to exposerecords that confirm what Plato said aboutAtlantis during the time of ancient Greece. Mr.Du Val said they will present their evidence tothe world before the end of 1998 or soon af-terward.Fig. 3-13.

If you had watchedthem, you wouldn’t have known what the heck they were doing; you’d have thought they were nuts. In order to describewhat they were doing, I have to describe something else firstThe StrThe StrThe StrThe StrThe Structure of the Human Brainucture of the Human Brainucture of the Human Brainucture of the Human Brainucture of the Human BrainThis circle [Fig. 4-1] represents a human head, looking down from above. There’s the nose (N). The human brain isdivided into two components, the left side and the right side.In Figure 4-2, the left side is male and the right side is female, and they are linked by the corpus callosum. Accordingto Thoth, this is the nature of these two hemispheres: The left, male component sees everything absolutely logically—asit is, you might say. The right, female component is much more concerned with experiencing something than understand-ing it. The female and male perceptions are mirror images of each other—as if you had a mirror between them. If you hadthe word LOVE written into the male component, he would see it as shown. But the female sees its mirror image, also asshown. When the male looks at her way of perceiving, he says, “There’s no logic here.” She looks at him and says,“Where is the feeling?”The brain is further divided into four lobes by another thin division. The male side of the brain has a componentbehind it that reflects, or mirrors the front, as shown in Figure 4-3. There’s another mirror image behind the female sidethat reflects what’s in front of it. The male logical component has a totally experiential component behind it and the femaleexperiential component has totally logical component behind it. It’s as if there are four mirrors reflecting each other inthese four possible ways. When we look at the geometries later, you’ll see that the forward part in the male brain, thelogical component, is based on the triangle and the square (in two dimensions) or the tetrahedron and the cube (in three"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96dimensions). The forward part in the female brain, the experiential component,is based on the triangle and the pentagon (in two dimensions) or the tetrahe-dron, the icosahedron and the dodecahedron (in three dimensions). There arealso diagonal pathways connecting the left-front logical to the back-right logical,and the right-front experiential to the back-left experiential. Thus the mirror qualityreflects side to side, front to back, and diagonal to diagonal. This is the waywe’re made up, according to Thoth.The Attempt to Birth a New Consciousness on AtlantisThe Attempt to Birth a New Consciousness on AtlantisThe Attempt to Birth a New Consciousness on AtlantisThe Attempt to Birth a New Consciousness on AtlantisThe Attempt to Birth a New Consciousness on AtlantisWhen the time was right, the Naacals from Lemuria created a spiritual rep-resentation of a human brain on the surface of their Atlantean island. Theirpurpose was to birth a new consciousness based on what they had learnedduring Lemuria. They believed the brain had to come first before the body ofthe new consciousness ofAtlantis was to emerge. With Thoth’s image of thehuman brain in mind, you can begin to make sense of their actions. First theymade a wall down the middle of the island about 40 feet high and 20 feet wide,which sealed off one side of the island from the other. Literally, you had to gointo the water to get to the other side. Then they ran a minor wall across at 90degrees to the first wall, which divided the island into four parts.Then half of these thousand people, who were of the Naacal Mystery School,went on one side and half stayed on the other, depending on their nature. Thatcould mean that all the women stayed on one side and all the men went to theother side, but as I understand it, where a person went did not depend on thephysical body, but his or her dependency on one side of the brain or the other.In this way, approximately half became the male component of the brain andthe other half became the female component.They spent thousands of years in this physical state until they believed theywere ready for the next step. Three people were selected to represent the cor-pus callosum, the part of the brain that links the left and right hemispherestogether. Thoth’s father, Thome, was one of these. He and two other peoplewere the only ones allowed to go everywhere on the island. Otherwise, the twosides had to remain completely separate from each other. Then the three be-gan to align their energies and thoughts and feelings and all aspectsFig. 4-1. The two hemispheres of the human brain.Fig. 4-2. Dynamics of the two hemispheres, reflectingside to side."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"97ofhumanness into an integrated human brain, not with human cells, but ratherwith human bodies.The next step was to project onto the surface ofAtlantis the form of the Tree ofLife. They used the form here [Fig. 4-4] with 12 circles on it instead of 10, but the 11thand 12th circles were off the mainland; one of the points was on Udal and one was inthe water to the south. So there were ten components on the mainland, which is theconfiguration we’re familiar with. Even though it extended over hundreds of miles onthe surface of this land, they projected it to the accuracy of a single atom, according toThoth. There is an indication that even the spheres of the Tree of Life were used to designate the size and shape of the citiesofAtlantis. Plato says in his book Critia5 that the main city of Atlantis was made of three rings of land separated by water, asshown in this drawing [Fig. 4-5]. He also says the city was constructed of red, black and white stones. This last statementwill make sense as soon as we talk about the Great Pyramid.The Children of Lemuria Are Called FThe Children of Lemuria Are Called FThe Children of Lemuria Are Called FThe Children of Lemuria Are Called FThe Children of Lemuria Are Called ForthorthorthorthorthSuddenly, in a single day, the brain of Atlantis, the Naacal Mystery School, breathed life into the Tree of Life on thesurface of Atlantis. This created vortexes of energy rotating out of each of the circles on the Tree of Life. Once thevortexes were established, then the brain ofAtlantis psychically called forth the children of Lemuria. Millions and millionsof Lemurians, who by then had settled along the west coast of North and South America and in other places, began to bepulled to Atlantis. A great migration began, and the ordinary people of the sunken Lemuria started moving toward Atlantis.Remember, they were feminine right-brained beings and inner communication was easy. However, the Lemurian body ofconsciousness had reached only the age of twelve as a planetary consciousness. It was still a child, and some of itscenters weren’t functioning yet; they had worked with those energies and had mastered only eight of the ten. So eachmigrating Lemurian was attracted to one of these eight centers on Atlantis, depending on the nature of the individual.There they settled and began to build cities.That left two vortexes with nobody using them, not a single person. These two vortexes were pulling life toward them,and in life you just can’t have an empty place. Life will find a way to fill it. For instance, if you’re driving along the freewayfollowing another car and you drop too far behind it, somebody will fill in the gap, right? If you leave a place empty, life willstep in and fill it. That’s exactly what happened on Atlantis.Though Lemurians settled into only eight of the vortex areas, Mayan records state clearly that there were ten cities inAtlantis when it fell. In fact, you can see those records in the Troano document, which is now located in the BritishMuseum. This document is estimated to be at least 3500 years old, and it describes in detail the sinking ofAtlantis. It’sMayan, and it contains an authentic account of the cataclysm, according to Le Plongeon, the French historian whotranslated it. Here is what it says:"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98In the year 6 Kan on the 11th Muluc in the month Zak, there occurred ter-rible earthquakes which continued without interruption until the 13th Chin.

The first racewas the Hebrews, coming from our future. Thoth says they came from off theplanet, but I don’t know specifically where. The Hebrews were kind of like a kidwho went through the fifth grade and didn’t make it and had to do that gradeover again. They hadn’t graduated to the next level of evolution, so they had torepeat that grade. In other words, they were like a child who had already beenthrough the math stuff. They knew a lot of things that we didn’t know yet. Theyhad legal permission from the Galactic Command to step into our evolutionarypath at that time. They brought with them, according to Thoth, many conceptsand ideas that we had no idea about yet because we hadn’t entered into thoselevels of awareness. This interaction actually benefited our evolution, I believe. Therewas no problem with their coming to Earth and settling. There probably would haveFig. 4-4. Tree of Life on Atlantis.Fig. 4-5. Atlantean city of Poseidon."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"99been no problem at all if just this one race had come here.The other race that stepped in at that time caused big problems. These beings came from the nearby planet of Mars.(I know this may sound strange, but it sounded even stranger when I was saying this back in 1985 before people likeRichard Hoagland began to speak up.) It has become evident, because of thesituation that has developed in the world, that this same race is still causingmajor problems. The secret government and the trillionaires of the world are ofMars extraction or have mostly Martian genes and little or no emotional/feelingbody.Mars afMars afMars afMars afMars after the Lter the Lter the Lter the Lter the Lucifer Rebellionucifer Rebellionucifer Rebellionucifer Rebellionucifer RebellionAccording to Thoth, Mars looked much like Earth a little less than a millionyears ago. It was beautiful. It had oceans and water and trees and was justfantastic. But then something happened to them, and it had to do with a past“Lucifer rebellion.”From the very beginning of this experiment we are in—and all of God’s cre-ation is an experiment—experiments similar to the Lucifer rebellion (if you want to call them rebellions) have been at-tempted four times. In other words, three other beings besides Lucifer attempted to do the same thing, and each time itresulted in utter chaos throughout the universe.More than a million years ago, the Martians had joined the third rebellion, the third time that life decided to try thisexperiment. And the experiment failed dramatically. Planets everywhere were destroyed, and Mars was one of them. Lifeattempted to create a separate reality from God, which is the same thing that’s going on now. In other words, a portion oflife attempted to separate itself from all other life and create its own separate reality. Since everyone is God anyway, thisis okay—you can do that. The only thing is, it never has worked so far. Nevertheless, they tried it again.When someone tries to separate from God, they sever their love connection with Reality. So when the Martians (andmany others) created a separate reality, they cut the love bond—they disconnected the emotional body—and in so doingthey became pure male, with little or no female within them. They were purely logical beings with no emotions. Like Mr.Spock in Star Trek, they were pure logic. What happened in Mars, and in thousands and thousands of other places, wasthat they ended up fighting all the time because there was no compassion, no love. Mars became a bat-tieground thatjust kept going on and on and on, until finally it became clear that Mars was not going to survive. Eventually they blewtheir atmosphere away and destroyed the surface of their planet.Before Mars was destroyed, they built huge tetrahedral pyramids, which you’re going to see in photographs in thesecond volume. Then they built three-sided, four-sided, and five-sided pyramids, eventually building a complex that wasable to create a synthetic Mer-Ka-Ba. You see, you can have a space-time vehicle that looks like a spaceship, or you can"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"100have certain other structures that do the same thing. They built a structure from which they were able to look ahead andbehind in time and space to tremendous distances and time periods.A small group of Martians tried to get away from Mars before it was destroyed, so they translated themselves into thefuture and found a perfect place to resettle before Mars was destroyed. That place was Earth, but it was about 65,000years in our past. They saw that little vortex sitting there on Atlantis with nobody in it. They didn’t ask permission. Beingpart of the rebellion, they didn’t go through the normal procedure. They just said, “All right, let’s do it.” They stepped rightinto that vortex, and in so doing, they joined our evolutionary path.Martians RMartians RMartians RMartians RMartians Rape the Human Child Consciousness and Tape the Human Child Consciousness and Tape the Human Child Consciousness and Tape the Human Child Consciousness and Tape the Human Child Consciousness and Takakakakake Overe Overe Overe Overe OverThere were only a few thousand of these Martians who actually used the time-space-dimension consciousnessmachine, or building. The very first thing they did when they arrived here on Earth was try to take control of Atlantis. Theywanted to declare war and take over. However, they were vulnerable because of their small numbers and perhaps otherreasons, so they couldn’t do it. They were finally subdued by the Atlanteans/ Lemurians. We were able to stop them fromconquering us, but we could not send them back. By the time this took place in our evolutionary path, we were about theage of a 14-year-old girl. So what you had here was similar to a 14-year-old girl being taken over by a much older man,a 60- or 70-year-old man who simply forced himself on her. In other words, it was rape. We were raped, we had nochoice. The Martians just stepped in and said, “Like it or not, we’re here.” They didn’t care what we thought or felt aboutit. It was really no different from what we in America did to the Native Americans.Once the initial conflict was over, it was agreed that the Martians would try to understand this female thing theylacked, this emotional feeling, of which they had none at all. Things more or less settled down for a long time. But theMartians slowly began to implement their left-brain technology, which the Lemurians didn’t know anything about. All theLemurians knew was right-brain technology, which today we know very little about. Psychotronic machines, dowsingrods and those kinds of things are right-brain technologies. Many right-brain feminine technologies would astound you ifyou saw them in action. You can do absolutely anything that you can imagine with right-brain technology, just as you canwith left-brain technology, if they are brought to their full potential. But then we really do not need either one—this is thegreat secret that we have forgotten!The Martians kept putting out these left-brain inventions, one after another after another, until finally they changedthe polarity of our evolutionary path because we began to “see” through the left brain, and we changed from female tomale. We changed the nature of who we were. The Martians gained control bit by bit, until eventually they controlledeverything without a battle. They had all the money and all the power. The animosity between the Martians and theLemurians—and I’m putting the Hebrews in with the Lemurians—never subsided, not even to the very end of Atlantis.They hated each other. The Lemurians, the feminine aspect, were basically shoved down and treated like inferiors. It wasnot a very loving situation. It was a marriage that the female component did not like, but I don’t think the Martian males"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"101really cared if she liked it or not. It remained this way for a very long time, until approximately 26,000 years ago, when thenext phase slowly began.Minor PMinor PMinor PMinor PMinor Pole Shifole Shifole Shifole Shifole Shift and the Subsequent Debatet and the Subsequent Debatet and the Subsequent Debatet and the Subsequent Debatet and the Subsequent DebateIt was about 26,000 years ago when we had another minor pole shift and a small change in consciousness. This poleshift took place at the same point on the polar wobble called the precession of the equinoxes that we have now returnedto (see the lower small oval at A in Fig. 4-6). It wasn’t much, though it has been recorded by science. The two small ovalson the cycle are where these changes always take place, and right now we’re back at point A again.At the time of this pole shift, a piece of Atlantis, probably about half the size of Rhode Island, sank into the ocean.That caused a tremendous amount of fear in Atlantis, because they thought they were going to lose the whole continent,like what happened to Lemuria. By this time they had lost most of their ability to see into the future. They were shaking intheir boots for a long time simply because they didn’t know for sure what was going to happen. They were still afraid ahundred years later, then slowly this fear began to subside. It took over 200 years for them to feel safe again.Atlantis was a little beyond the lower oval at A when they finally relaxed their fear about Earth changes. But thememory was still there. They were going along nicely for a while, then out of the blue approximately 13,000 to 16,000years ago, a comet approached Earth. When this comet was still in deep space, the Atlanteans knew about it becausethey were more technologically advanced than we are now. They witnessed its approach.A great conflict began to occur in Atlantis. The Martians, who were in the minority even though they were in control,wanted to blow it out of the sky with their laser technology. But there was a huge movement amongst the Lemurianpopulation against using the Martian left-brained technology. The feminine aspect said, “This comet is in divine order, andwe should allow this to take place naturally. Let it hit the Earth. That is what’s supposed to take place.”Of course, the Martians replied, “No! Let’s blow it out of the sky. We have very little time, or we all will be killed.” Afterlots of arguing, the Martians finally and reluctantly agreed to allow the comet to hit the Earth. When it arrived, it camescreaming into the atmosphere, plunging into the Atlantic Ocean just off the western shore of Atlantis near where Charleston,South Carolina, is now, only it was on the bottom of the ocean then. The remnants of that comet are now scattered overfour states. Science has definitely determined that it did hit there somewhere between 13,000 and 16,000 years ago.They’re still finding pieces. Although most of the fragments were centered near Charleston, one of the two largest piecesactually struck the main body of Atlantis in its southwestern area. These left two huge holes in the floor of the AtlanticOcean and could have been the true cause of the sinking of Atlantis. The actual sinking did not happen at that time, buttook place at least several hundred years later."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102The Martians’ FThe Martians’ FThe Martians’ FThe Martians’ FThe Martians’ Fateful Decisionateful Decisionateful Decisionateful Decisionateful DecisionThe pieces of the comet that crashed into the southwest-ern area of Atlantis happened to be right where the Martianswere living, killing a huge portion of their population. The Mar-tians got hurt the worst by consenting to allow the comet to comein. Well, that was too humiliating and painful for them. This wasthe beginning of a great loss of consciousness for Earth. Whatwas about to take place was the seed for a bitter tree, the sametree we live by today. The Martians said, “It’s all over. We aredivorcing you. We’re going to do whatever we want from nowon. You can do whatever you want, but we’re going to lead ourown lives and try to control our own fate. And we’re not going tolisten to you ever again.” You know this whole number. We’ve seen it in divorced families throughout the world. And thechildren? Look at our world! We are the children!The Martians decided to take over the Earth, of course. Control, the Martian’s primary interface with the Reality, roseto meet their anger. They began to create a building complex like the one they had constructed on Mars a long timeearlier, in order to create a synthetic Mer-Ka-Ba once again. The only thing is, around 50,000 Earth years had passedsince they had created one, and they didn’t remember exactly how to do it—but they thought they did. So they built thebuildings and began the experiment. That experiment is directly tied to a chain of Mer-Ka-Bas that began with the Marsexperiments a little less than a million years before. Later, one was done here on Earth in 1913, another one in 1943(called the Philadelphia Experiment), another one in 1983 (called the Montauk Experiment), and another one that, Ibelieve, they’re attempting to do this year (1993) near Bimini Island. These dates are windows of time that open up andare tied to the harmonics of the situation. The experiments must be timed to these windows in order to succeed.If the Martians had succeeded in setting up a synthetic harmonic Mer-Ka-Ba, they would have had absolute controlof the planet, if that was their intention. They would have been able to make anybody on the planet do anything theywanted, though eventually it would have meant their own demise. No higher-order being would place this kind of controlon another if they truly understood the Reality.FFFFFailure of the Martian Mer-Kailure of the Martian Mer-Kailure of the Martian Mer-Kailure of the Martian Mer-Kailure of the Martian Mer-Ka-Ba Attempta-Ba Attempta-Ba Attempta-Ba Attempta-Ba AttemptThe Martians built the buildings in Atlantis, set up the whole experiment, then threw their switch to begin the energyflow. Almost immediately they lost control of the experiment, like falling through space and time. The degree of destruc-tion was more horrible and sinful than I care to describe. In this Reality, you can hardly make a greater error than to createan out-of-control synthetic Mer-Ka-Ba. What the experiment did was begin to rip open the lower-dimensional levels of the"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"103Earth—not the higher ones, but the lower ones. To give an analogy, the human body has membranes between differentparts, such as in the heart, the stomach, the liver, the eyes and so on. If you took a knife and slit open your stomach,that’s would be like ripping open the dimensional levels of the Earth. Various aspects are separated from other aspectsof spirit by these dimensional membranes, and they’re not meant to mix. You’re not supposed to have blood in yourstomach, but in your arteries. The purpose of a blood cell is different from that of a stomach cell.These Martians did something that almost killed the Earth. The environmental disaster we are experiencing today isnothing in comparison, though the problems we are having are a direct result of what we did long ago. With the right under-standing and enough love, the environment could be repaired in a single day. But had this Martian experiment continued, itwould have destroyed the Earth forever. We would never have been able to use the Earth as a seed base again.The Martians made a very, very serious mistake. This out-of-control Mer-Ka-Ba field, first of all, released a hugenumber of lower-dimensional spirits into the Earth’s higher-dimensional planes. These spirits were forced into a worldthey did not understand or know, and were in total fear. They had to live—they had to have bodies—so they went rightinto people, hundreds of them into each person in Atlantis. The Atlanteans could not stop them from entering theirbodies. Finally, almost every person in the world was totally possessed by these beings from another dimension. Thesespirits were really Earthlings like us, but very different, not coming from this dimensional level. It was a total catastrophe—the biggest catastrophe the Earth has probably ever seen.A Disruptive Heritage: The Bermuda TriangleThe Martians’ attempt to control the world took place near one of the Atlantean islands in the area we now call theBermuda Triangle. There’s an actual building sitting on the ocean floor down there that contains three rotating star-tetrahedral electromagnetic fields superimposed on each other, creating a huge synthetic Mer-Ka-Ba that stretches outover the ocean and into deep space. This Mer-Ka-Ba is completely out of control. It’s called the Bermuda Trianglebecause the apex of one of the tetrahedrons—the stationary one—is sticking up out of the water there. The other twofields, are counterrotating—and the faster-rotating field sometimes moves clockwise, which is a very dangerous situa-tion. (When we say clockwise, we mean the source of the field, not the field itself. The field itself would appear to berotating counterclockwise.) You’ll understand this when you learn more about the Mer-Ka-Ba. When the faster fieldrotates counterdocfewise (from its source), everything’s okay; but when the faster one moves clockwise (from its source),that’s when time and space distortions happen. Many of the airplanes and ships that have disappeared in the BermudaTriangle have literally gone into other dimensional levels because of the out-of-control field there.A primary cause of much of the distortion in the world—the distortion between humans such as wars, marital prob-lems, emotional disturbances etc.—is that imbalanced field. That field is not only causing distortions on Earth, it’s causingdistortions way, way, way out in remote areas of space because of the way Reality is constructed. That’s one of thereasons why this race of beings called the Grays, and other ET beings we’ll talk about at the appropriate time, are tryingto correct what happened here long ago. This is a big problem that extends way beyond Earth. What they did back in"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104Atlantis was against all galactic law. It was illegal, but they did it anyway. It will be solved, but not until the year 2012.There’s not much the ETs can do in the meantime, but they’ll probably keep trying. Eventually they’ll succeed.The Solution: A Christ Consciousness GridAscended Masters Assist the EarthAt the time of the synthetic Mer-Ka-Ba failure, there were about 1600 ascended masters on Earth, and they dideverything they could to try to heal the situation. They tried to seal the dimensional levels and get as many of these spiritsas they could out of people and back into their own worlds. They did everything on every level they could. They eventuallygot most of the spirits out and healed about 90 to 95 percent or more of the situation, but people still found many of theseunusual beings living in their bodies.The situation at that time began to deteriorate extremely rapidly. All the systems on Atlantis—financial, social and allthe concepts of how life ought to be—degenerated and collapsed. The continent of Atlantis and all its people becamesick. They started getting weird diseases. The entire continent went into a state of survival just trying to live through eachday. The situation grew continually worse. For a long period of time it was hell on Earth, horrible. If it had not been sloweddown by the ascended masters, it would truly have been the end of this world.The ascended masters (the highest levels of our consciousness at that time) didn’t know what to do to help bring usback into a state of grace. I mean they really didn’t know what to do. They were children compared to the events that hadbeen forced upon them, and they had no idea how to handle it. So they prayed. They called in higher levels of conscious-ness. They called in everybody who could hear their plea, including the great Galactic Command. They prayed andprayed. So the problem was reviewed on many high levels of life.Similar kinds of events have happened before on other planets; this wasn’t the first time. So before it actually hap-pened, our ascended masters and galactic friends knew that we were going to fall out of grace, out of the high level ofawareness we were experiencing at the time. They knew that we were going to fall way down the spectrum of life. Theirconcern was to figure out some way to get us back up on track after the fall, and they knew it had to be done quickly. Theywere looking for a solution that would heal the whole Earth, both the dark and the light. They weren’t concerned with asolution where only the Martians would be healed, or only the Lemurians or only part of the Earth. They were looking fora situation that would heal the whole Earth and all of its inhabitants.Higher levels of consciousness don’t go along with this “us and them” point of view. There’s only one consciousnessmoving through all life, and they were trying to get everybody to come back into a state of love and respect for each other."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"105They knew that the only way they could do it was to get us back into Christconsciousness, a level ofbeingness where we can see the unity, and they knewwe would proceed from there with love and compassion. They knew that if wewere going to get back on track, we would have to be in Christ consciousnessas a planet by the end of the 13,000-year cycle—which is now. If we were not inChrist consciousness by then, we wouldn’t make it at all. We would destroyourselves. Although spirit is eternal, life interruptions can be temporally lost.The only problem was that we couldn’t get back to Christ consciousness byourselves, at least in a short time. Once we had fallen to this level it would be avery, very long time before we would be able to come back up naturally. So theproblem was really one of time. We were part of a greater consciousness thatNote: For those of you who believe thatwe will be out of this dimension before 2012,you are probably right.

It would be much likehaving a child who hit his head real hard, resulting in a concussion. You would want him to return to consciousnessquickly.It was finally decided to try a kind of standard operating procedure that usually works in these situations, though notalways. In other words, it was an experiment. Earth’s people were about to be subjects of a galactic experimental projectin the hope of helping us. We would experiment on ourselves. It wasn’t done by extraterrestrials or anything like that; theysimply showed us how to do it. We were given instructions on how to proceed with this experiment, and we actuallycarried it out. . . successfully.What about the Sirians? Our helpers honestly believed that we would make it, though they knew it would be close. Infact, they wouldn’t have gotten permission from the Galactic Command to do the experiment if they hadn’t honestlybelieved we would make it. You can’t lie to the Galactic Command.A PlanetarA PlanetarA PlanetarA PlanetarA Planetary Gridy Gridy Gridy Gridy GridAt this point, so that you’ll understand the procedure they decided on, I need to talk about grids. A planetary grid is anetheric crystalline structure that envelops the planet and holds the consciousness of any one species of life. Yes, it doeshave an electromagnetic component associated with the third dimension, but it also has an appropriate higher-dimen-sional component for each dimension. Science will eventually discover that there’s a grid for every single species in theworld. There were originally 30 million grids around the Earth, but now there are about 13 to 15 million, and they’redecreasing rapidly. If there are just two bugs on the planet, and they’re just sitting somewhere in Iowa, they have a gridthat stretches around the entire planet, or they couldn’t exist. It’s just the nature of the game."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106Each of these grids has its own geometry and is unique; there’s not another one like it. Just as a species’ body isunique, its point of view of interpreting the Reality is also unique. The Christ consciousness grid holds the Christ con-sciousness for the planet, and if that grid isn’t there, we can’t reach Christ consciousness. This grid was there duringAtlantean times, though we were very young, and it was beginning to function at certain times during the precession ofthe equinoxes. They knew it would be placed into a passive state by the Martians’ actions, so they decided to syntheticallyactivate the Christ consciousness grid around the Earth. It would be a living grid, but it would be synthetically made—likecreating a synthetic crystal from a living cell of a live crystal. Then at the right time, hopefully before we killed ourselves off,the new grid would be complete, and we could ascend to our previous level once again. One example of the effect of agrid is shown in the hundredth monkey theory.The Hundredth-Monkey ConceptYou have probably read the book, The Hundredth Monkey by Ken Keyes, Jr., or perhaps the earlier book ofLyallWatson, Lifetide: The Biology of the Unconscious, who describe a 30-year scientific research project on the Japanesemonkey, Macaco fuscata. The island ofKoshima, Japan, has a wild colony and the scientists were providing them withsweet potatoes dropped in the sand. The monkeys liked the sweet potatoes, but not the sand and dirt. An eighteen-month-old female they named Imo found she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes. She taught this trick toher mother. Her playmates also learned this new way, and they taught their mothers, too. Soon all the young monkeyswashed their sweet potatoes, but only the adults who imitated their children learnedthis behavior. The scientists recorded these events between the years 1952 and1958.Then suddenly, in the autumn of 1958, the few monkeys doing this on theisland ofKoshima reached a critical mass, which Dr. Watson arbitrarily placed at100, and bingo!—almost every monkey on the island started washing its pota-toes without any further influence. If it had happened on only that one island, theyprobably would have figured there was some form of communication and lookedfor it. But simultaneously the monkeys on the surrounding islands also startedwashing their potatoes. Even on the mainland of Japan in Takasakiyama themonkeys were washing their potatoes. There was no possible way these mon-keys could have communicated by any way we know. It was the first time thatscientists had ever observed anything like this. They postulated that there musthave been some kind of morphogenetic structure or field that stretched acrossthese islands through which the monkeys were able to communicate."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"107The Hundredth HumanThe Hundredth HumanThe Hundredth HumanThe Hundredth HumanThe Hundredth HumanMany people thought a lot about the hundredth monkey phenomenon. Then a few years later a scientific team fromAustralia and Britain wondered if human beings possessed a grid similar to the monkeys. They did an experiment. Theymade a photograph that had hundreds of human faces in it, little ones and big ones, faces in the eyes. Everything wasmade up of these faces, but when you first looked at it, you could see only about six or seven. It took training to see theother ones. Usually someone had to first point out where they were.These people took their picture to Australia and conducted a study there. They selected a certain number of peoplefrom a spectrum of the population, then showed each of them the picture, giving them a certain length of time to look atit. They held the photograph up to someone and said, “How many faces do you see in this photo?” During the time thesubjects were given, they would generally come up with six, seven, eight, nine or maybe ten faces. Few people sawmore. When they had gotten a few hundred people as their basic sampling and recorded accurately what had beenobserved, some of the researchers went to England—on the other side of the planet—and showed the picture on aclosed-cable BBC television station that broadcasts only to England. They carefully showed where all the faces were,every single face. Then a few minutes later other researchers repeated the original experiment with new subjects inAustralia. Suddenly people could easily see most of the faces.From that moment, they knew for certain that there was something about humans that had not been known. Now,the Aborigines in Australia had known about this “unknown” part of us for a long time. They knew that there was anenergy field connecting people. Even in our society, we’ve observed that somebody on one side of the planet wouldinvent something very complex at the same moment that someone on the other side of the Earth invented the samething, with the same principles and ideas. Each inventor would say, “You stole it from me. It was mine. I did it first.” Thishas happened many, many times, stretching back for a long time. So after this Australian experiment, they began torealize that something very definitely connects us all.The GoverThe GoverThe GoverThe GoverThe Government’s Discovernment’s Discovernment’s Discovernment’s Discovernment’s Discovery of the Grid and the Ry of the Grid and the Ry of the Grid and the Ry of the Grid and the Ry of the Grid and the Race for Controlace for Controlace for Controlace for Controlace for ControlAs far back as the early 1960s, the American and Russian governments had discovered these electromagneticfields, or grids, that stretched around the world. Human grids—yes, there are more than one—are high above the Earth,about 60 miles or more.Remember, I told you about the five levels of consciousness on Earth that correspond to different numbers of genesand different heights? Well, there are only three levels of consciousness that Earth is actually experiencing right now.Two others are way beyond us at this time. The first level is primal, the second level is our present consciousness, andthe third level is the Christ or unity consciousness, the one we’re about to enter. After the Fall, about 13,000 years ago,there were only two active human grids around the Earth, the first and the second levels. The Aborigines in Australia were"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108on the first level, for example, and we, the mutants, were on the second level. (That’s what they call us—mutants—because we mutated to where we are now.) Science has done very little research on the Australian Aborigines, so ourcountries haven’t become aware of their grid. But the governments did a lot of research on us, and they discoveredexactly what our grid looks like: It’s based on triangles and squares. It’s a very male grid that stretches around the wholeplanet. Now, we have a third grid up there, which we will call the unity-consciousness grid, or simply “the next step.” It’sbeen there, completed, since February 4, 1989. Without that grid, it would be all over for us, folks. But it is there. Thegovernments became originally aware of our second-level grid maybe as far back as the 1940s. I realize that this state-ment is in contradiction to what was said above. But nevertheless I believe that the grid was discovered even before thehundredth monkey theory came out. Because of World War II, the governments were beginning to place military basesall over the world in little out-of-the-way places, on obscure islands like Guam. Why did they select these particular placesfor their bases? It probably wasn’t for the reasons they said. When you lay out the grid and the military bases all over theworld, especially those of Russia and the United States, well, son-of-a-gun, the bases are almost always located right onthe nodal points of the grid—exactly over the top or on little spirals that come off of the nodal points. It could not possiblyhave been a coincidence that they just happened to spread out their empire of military bases in these precise places.They were trying to take control of this grid, because if they could control it, they knew they could control what we thinkand feel. A subtle war was going on between these two governments. However, the war changed its nature considerablyin 1970, though I’ll have to explain that later. Of course, behind both the United States and Russia was the secretgovernment, which controlled the outer appearance and timing of this conflict.How the Grid WHow the Grid WHow the Grid WHow the Grid WHow the Grid Was Constras Constras Constras Constras Constructed, and Whereucted, and Whereucted, and Whereucted, and Whereucted, and WhereNow that we have the necessary background, we can continue with the drama in Atlantis. The project to rebuild thegrid was begun by three men: Thoth, a being named Ra and a being named Araragat. These men flew to a place in whatis now Egypt, to the area now called the Giza plateau. At that time it was not a desert, but a tropical rain forest, and it wascalled the Land of Khem, which means the land of the hairy barbarians. The three men went to that particular placebecause the axis of the old unity-consciousness grid extended out of the Earth from that point. They were going to rebuilda new grid on the old axis, according to instructions given by higher consciousness.They had to wait until the right moment—until the precession of the equinoxes passed the low ebb in conscious-ness—before they could act, and this low ebb was still far into their future. After that they would have a little less than halfa cycle, about 12,900 years or so, to complete everything by the end of the twentieth century. We couldn’t go any longerthan this or we would destroy ourselves and our planet.First they had to complete the grid on the higher dimensions, then they had to physically build the temples in thisdimension before the new unity grid would manifest. Once manifested and balanced, they were to help us begin toconsciously move into the higher worlds of being and begin anew our path home to God."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"109So Thoth and friends went to the very spot where the unity-consciousness vortex exited the Earth. This point wasabout a mile away from where the Great Pyramid sits in the desert today, but then it was out in the middle of nowhere, inthe middle of a rain forest. Centered right over the axis of this vortex on the Earth, they created a hole extendingapproximately one mile into the Earth, lining it with bricks. It took only a few minutes or so, because they were sixth-dimensional beings, and whatever they thought always happened. It was that simple.Once the hole aligned with the unity axis was created, they mapped the ten Golden Mean spirals that emerged fromthe hole and located where they moved above the Earth. They used the hole as the axis, starting far down, and mappedthe spirals of energy as they moved up out of the hole and extended into space. One of the spirals exited the Earth notfar from the present Great Pyramid. Once they found it, they built a little stone building in front of the hole; that building isthe key to the entire Giza complex. Then they built the Great Pyramid.According to Thoth, the Great Pyramid was built by himself, not Cheops. Thoth says that it was completed about 200years prior to the shifting of the axis. The apex of the Great Pyramid, if the capstone were in place, sat exactly on thecurve of the spiral. They lined up the center of the hole with the south face of the stone building and the north face of theGreat Pyramid. It has amazed surveyors who have looked at this. Though these structures are a mile away from eachother, the south face of the stone building and the north face of the Great Pyramid are in perfect alignment. They do notbelieve that we could do it any better today even with our modern technology.Later the other two pyramids were also built directly on that spiral. In fact, that’s how the hole was discovered,through aerial photography. They noticed that the three pyramids were laid out on a logarithmic spiral. Then they tracedthe spiral back to its source and went to that spot, and there was the hole and the stone building. That discovery wasmade, I believe, in the early 1980s. It was recorded in the McCollum survey that was completed in 1984 by RockyMcCollum.I’ve seen the axis hole and the building with my own eyes. I consider it to be the most important place in all of Egyptand so does the Edgar Cayce A.R.E. There’s also another hole about a city block away from the first spiral, and this spiralstarts out a little differently, but then slowly, asymptotically, superimposes itself over the first spiral. To be able to buildaround this hole in this spiral pattern, the planners had to have a very sophisticated understanding of life. (I’ll explain thisunderstanding later also.) So these two completed spirals defined the axis of what would eventually become the unity-consciousness grid around the Earth.Sacred SitesSacred SitesSacred SitesSacred SitesSacred SitesAfter starting the new grid over the existing collapsed grid and putting one pyramid on the line of the spiral, Thoth, Raand Araragat mapped where these two energy lines curved and crossed each other in over 83,000 places on the surfaceof the Earth. Fourth-dimensionally, one dimension higher than this one, they constructed an entire network of buildingsand structures over the whole planet, placing them on the nodes of this energy matrix. All of these structures were laid out"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110with the proportions of either the Golden Mean or Fibonacci spirals, and all were mathematically referred back to thatsingle point in Egypt now called the Solar Cross.The location of the sacred sites of the world are no accident. It was a single consciousness that created every singleone of them—from Machu Picchu to Stonehenge to Zaghouan—you name it, to anywhere. Almost all of them (with a fewexceptions) were created by a single awareness. We’re becoming more aware of this now. Richard Hoagland’s workbrings this forth, though he wasn’t the first one. They show how one sacred site is extrapolated from another one, thenanother and still another. These sites go beyond time, in that they were all built at different times, and they go beyond anyparticular culture or geographical location. They were obviously done by one consciousness who coordinated the wholeenterprise. Eventually researchers will see that this spot in Egypt is the point from which all the other sacred sites werecalculated.This Egyptian area is the north pole of the unity-consciousness grid. On the other side of the planet, out in the SouthPacific in the Tahitian Islands, is a little island called Moorea, where the south pole of the grid is located. For those of youwho have been on top of Wayna Picchu for a birds-eye view, Machu Picchu, at about 9000 feet in the Peruvian moun-tains, seems to be surrounded in a perfect circle by mountains. It’s like a female circle surrounding a phallus rising in themiddle. Well, the island of Moorea is similar to this, only it’s shaped like a heart. Each house on Moorea has a heart withthe house number on it. The phallic Moorean mountain in the center of the heart is much bigger than Wayna Picchu inPeru, but you will still see the same ring of mountains surrounding this earthen pole. This is the precise south pole of theentire unity-consciousness grid. If you go straight through the Earth at Moorea, you come out in Egypt. It’s off only anever so tiny bit—there’s a very slight curve, which is natural. The Moorean pole is negative, or female, and the Egyptianpole is positive, or male. All the sacred sites are connected to the Egyptian pole, and they’re all interlinked through thecentral axis leading to Moorea. It’s a torus, of course.The Pyramid’s Landing Platform and the Ship beneath the SphinxThis is the Great Pyramid [Fig. 4-7]. It has a so-called “missing capstone,” and there have been all kinds of specula-tions about it. According to Thoth, the actual missing capstone is 51/2 inches high and solid gold; it is a holographic imageof the entire pyramid. In other words, it has all the little rooms in it and everything in proportion, and it’s sitting in the Hallof Records. The other two pyramids go up to a sharp point; only the Great Pyramid has a flat surface on top. That missingpiece is not little—it’s about 24 feet square at the base. If you get on top, it’s a huge platform. This flat area is actually alanding platform for a very special airship that exists on Earth.The Sphinx is not far away from the Great Pyramid. According to The Emerald Tablets and Thoth, the Sphinx ismuch, much older than the 10- to 15,000 years estimated by John Anthony West. One factor that many present researchershave neglected to consider is that the Sphinx has been under sand during most of its recent existence. In fact, when Napoleonwent to see the Sphinx, he didn’t even know it was there because all he saw was its head. It was completely buried, and it has"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"111been buried for most of the last few hundred years at least. Taking that factor intoconsideration, which could be a major one, the wear caused by rain and wind wouldhave taken a lot longer than they’re presently figuring.According to Thoth, the Sphinx goes back at least five and a half million years.I guess eventually that will be brought forth, because he hasn’t been wrong aboutanything yet. Even John Anthony West secretly suspects that it is a great deal olderthan 10- to 15,000 years. He wasn’t concerned with making speculations into themillions of years; he just wanted to get it well past the 6000-year mark, because thatwill crack our previously accepted Earth history. He and his team have now donethat, and later, I believe, they’ll try to push the date back further as they introducemore evidence.According to Thoth, approximately one mile under the Sphinx there is a roundroom with a flat floor and a flat ceiling. Inside this room is the oldest synthetic objectin the world—older than any other consciously assembled matter on Earth. Accord-ing to Thoth, though even he can’t prove it, this object goes back 500 million yearswhen “that which led to human life” began. The object is about two city blocks insize; it’s round like a disk and has a flat bottom and top. It’s unusual in that its skin isonly three to five atoms thick. Its top and bottom surfaces have a certain patternthat’s shown in Figure 4-8.The pattern itself is five atoms thick; everywhere else it’s only three at-oms thick. And it’s transparent—you can see right through it—almost like it’snot there. This is a ship, but it has no motors or visible form of power. Eventhough Doreal’s interpretation of The Emerald Tablets states that this shiphad atomic motors in it, according to Thoth it does not. Doreal translatedThe Emerald Tablets in the Yucatan in 1925 and could not understand thedescription of how the ship was powered. The idea of atomic motors was thefarthest-out idea he could think of for a power source. But it is actually pro-pelled by thoughts and feelings, and is designed to connect with and extendyour own living Mer-Ka-Ba. This ship is connected directly to the spirit of theEarth, and in The Emerald Tablets it’s called a warship. It was the protectorfor the Earth."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112The Vulnerability ofThis Period and theAppearance of theHeroineEvery single time wereach that vulnerablepoint in the precessionof the equinoxes whenour poles make theselittle shifts, extraterrestri-als have tried to takeover the planet, accord-ing to The Emerald Tab-lets. This has been go-ing on for millions andmillions of years, and it’sstill going on. When Iread that in the Tablets, I didn’t yet know about the Grays or any of these beings,and I thought, “Someone coming from somewhere else to take over the Earth?Naw, this is silly!” But even today, this same thing’s going on. It never stops, it justkeeps on. It’s called, simply, the battle of the dark and the light.Every single time a takeover seems imminent, there has always been one verypure person who figures out how to get into the next level of consciousness, then findsthe ship and raises it into the air. The Earth and the Sun connect within that person andgive him or her great power, then whatever that person thinks and feels will happen.That’s how this airship is a warship: Whatever races are trying to take over Earth, thisperson just thinks them away—thinks up a situation that forces them to leave. Thiskeeps our evolutionary process going without any kind of outside interference or influ-ence. At least that’s what is supposed to happen.By now we have definitely been tampered with. That pure person has appeared,and that event has already happened here on Earth. This is why the Grays are leaving.The problems they’re having is because of one single woman—one 23-year-old fe-male from Peru (she was 23 in 1989 when she did this).

Firstshe made some basic connections that had to be done with crystals on the Earth, then performed the programming thathad to be recalculated. The very next thing she did was to think that the Grays and others related to this attemptedtakeover of Earth were going to become sick if they remained here, and there would be no cure.Within one month, all the Grays started getting sick, and the whole process she envisioned began to happen. TheGrays have been forced to leave the Earth now. Their bases have been abandoned, and they have been forced to altertheir plans. The presence of this entire army of beings from space has now been reduced to almost nothing, all becauseof one small but holy woman. It’s amazing [chuckles]. We guys know what that’s like—I’ve been reduced to nothing lotsof times by my wife.Awaiting the Atlantean CatastropheAwaiting the Atlantean CatastropheAwaiting the Atlantean CatastropheAwaiting the Atlantean CatastropheAwaiting the Atlantean CatastropheThoth and his partners finished the complex in Egypt to help rebuild the grid. Then they abandoned it in the middle ofthe rain forest and went back to Atlantis to prepare. It sat alone for 200 years, because they knew that at that critical pointin the precession of the equinoxes, the poles would shift. They knew that Atlantis would sink, so they waited.One day it finally happened. The catastrophe actually took only one night. Science has proven that when poles shift,it takes about 20 hours. It happens just like that [snaps fingers]. You wake up one normal day, and that evening it’s atotally different world. The whole process is about three and a half days long, but the pole shift happens in about 20hours. We’re all going to experience this enormous change when we see big chunks of the United States start to drop offinto the water—then you’ll know it’s for sure. There are other early signs that will tip you off that the change is about tohappen. When enough information has been given, I’ll remind you of what you already hold in your memories.When they saw the very first signs of the shift coming on, Thoth, Ra and Araragat returned to the Sphinx and raisedthe warship into the sky. All they did was raise the vibration of the molecules only one overtone higher than the Earthexists on. This allowed them and the ship to pass right through the Earth into the sky. Then they moved to Atlantis,lowered the ship to the surface, and picked up the people of the Naacal Mystery School, which included the originalimmortals from Lemuria as well as those who became enlightened during the time of Atlantis (by that time about another600 people had ascended). So the original thousand from Lemuria and the 600 from Atlantis had increased the numberof ascended masters to about 1600, the only occupants of the ancient airship.Now, the people on this ship were not only passengers, they were creating a living group Mer-Ka-Ba that surrounded theship with a very large field in the shape of a flying saucer—the same shape that’s around the galaxy and around your bodywhen your Mer-Ka-Ba is spinning. They had a very powerful protective field around themselves as they headed for Khem, soonto be the new Egypt. Thoth said that they had risen about a quarter mile off the planet with the members of the mystery schoolon board when they watched the island of Udal sink. This was the last piece of Atlantis to disappear into the water, with theexception of a few small islands. Then they flew the ship to Egypt and landed it on top of the Great Pyramid. From the side it"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114looked like the middle drawing in Figure 4-9.If you were to extend the Great Pyramid up to where thecapstone would naturally terminate, you would find that theship and the pyramid were built for each other. If you wereto look at this from the top, it would look like the right-handview in the figure. The circle is the ship and the square is theGreat Pyramid. The perimeter of the Great Pyramid and thecircumference of the ship are the same. It’s debatable if that’spossible or not, but they can get very, very close. Wheneverthat mathematical relationship happens, life appears. It’s thebasic relationship of life throughout the universe. (We’ll describe this geometrically soon.) If the ascended masters had not hadspinning Mer-Ka-Ba fields around them, they wouldn’t be here today (and probably neither would we), because their Mer-Ka-Bas protected them from all that happened next.After they landed on the pyramid, the poles began to shift and the human consciousness of the Earth began toplummet. Simultaneously, the electromagnetic and magnetic fields of the Earth collapsed, and all life on this planet wentinto the Great Void, the three and a half days of absolute blackness described by many cultures around the world.The Three and a Half Days of the VThe Three and a Half Days of the VThe Three and a Half Days of the VThe Three and a Half Days of the VThe Three and a Half Days of the VoidoidoidoidoidThe Emerald Tablets say that every single time we go around the precession of the equinoxes and our poles gothrough these changes, we go through a void space for about three and a half days. The Mayas described the Void in theTroano document. At one point in the story, three and a half stones are painted black. This refers to the time when we gointo what we now call the electromagnetic null zone. As the poles shift, a phenomenontakes place (we’ll go into great detail about this later) where for about three and a half days we’re in darkness (it couldactually be anywhere from two or two and a half days to a little over four days). The last time, it was evidently three anda half days. It’s more than just blackness; it’s nothing, it’s void. And, by the way, when you are in the Void, you will realizethat you and God are one, that there is no difference at all. We’ll talk about the Void again at the right moment.MemorMemorMemorMemorMemoryyyyy, Magnetic F, Magnetic F, Magnetic F, Magnetic F, Magnetic Fields and Mer-Kields and Mer-Kields and Mer-Kields and Mer-Kields and Mer-Ka-Basa-Basa-Basa-Basa-BasIf the people on the warship hadn’t been protected by the Mer-Ka-Ba during that change, they would have com-pletely lost their memories. You see, our memory is held together primarily by a magnetic field that exists around thebrain—inside the skull and around the head. That field is further connected to every cell in the brain by individualizedmagnetic fields within each cell. Science first found the internal magnetic particles within each cell and then found thelarger outer field. This was the first new find in human physiology in the last 300 years.

Its connection to the Earth’s magnetic field is not understood by scienceat this time. If you don’t have a means of protecting your memory, it will be erased, gone. It’ll be like unplugging acomputer in the middle of a file. It’s just gone. That’s exactly what happened to the Atlanteans and others who survivedthe catastrophe but who didn’t have spinning Mer-Ka-Bas. Those very sophisticated people, who were more advancedthan you and I, suddenly found themselves in a situation where they didn’t know anything. They had high-tech bodiesand high-tech minds, but it was like having a great PC sitting on the table with no software, nothing there.So the population that survived, and there were a few, had to start all over again. They had to begin at square one tofigure out how to stay warm, how to make fire and so on. This loss of memory was the result of their forgetting how tobreathe, forgetting their Mer-Ka-Bas, forgetting everything—falling down through the dimensions, going into a totally unpro-tected state and ending up in this very dense world—having to eat food again, doing all kinds of things that hadn’t been part ofour experience for a very long time. They were slammed into a very dense aspect of the planet and had to learn to survive allover again. This was all a result of the synthetic Mer-Ka-Ba experiment that had taken place on Atlantis.Without that small group of ascended masters, we would not have survived at all—we definitely would all have lefthuman experience. The whole Earth experiment would have been over forever. But they kept the field alive, just barely,while everything else crashed around them. Besides the ascended masters, there were also two other groups on Earthwho had Mer-Ka-Ba fields intact at the time. The Nefilim and the Sirians, our mother and father, kept their fields alive. Idon’t know where the Nefilim retreated to within this planet’s dimensional worlds, but the Sirians remained in the Halls ofAmend, inside the inner earth. Both of these groups are still here on the planet, hidden within the dimensional worlds.What the Thoth Group Did afWhat the Thoth Group Did afWhat the Thoth Group Did afWhat the Thoth Group Did afWhat the Thoth Group Did after Light Returter Light Returter Light Returter Light Returter Light ReturnednednednednedAfter the three and a half days of darkness, the Earth reappeared, light reappeared, the fields stabilized themselves,and we were down in this third-dimensional world where we are now. Everything was new and different—everything. Ithad totally changed experientially. When we consider the landmass of Atlantis, the Atlanteans had really been on a muchhigher level of interpreting that landmass. They didn’t experience it like we do. It was experienced in a totally different waythat’s pretty hard to explain from our third-dimensional point of view.After they landed on top of the Great Pyramid, Ra and about a third of the people from the ship went down througha tunnel that goes into a room at the two-thirds level, which will someday be discovered. (They’ve discovered four newrooms in the Great Pyramid in only the last few years.) When this room is discovered, they’ll find that it’s made with red,black and white stones, which were the primary architectural colors of Atlantis. This is what Thoth told me to say. Fromthis room is a channel they used to descend to a city or a temple far below the pyramid, which Thoth and friends builtwhen they built the pyramid. It was designed to hold approximately 10,000 people because they knew a large numberwould ascend over the next 13,000 years, until the Day of Purification.After the fields stabilized and a third of the people followed Ra into the room made of red, black and white stones,from there they entered the underground city and began the root of our present civilization. Another part of the root wasbeing formed at the same time in Sumer (another story). At the same moment in time, the remaining 1067 or so as-cended masters lifted the warship off the Great Pyramid and flew to the place now called Lake Titicaca, where they"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"116landed on the Island of the Sun (in Bolivia). Thoth got off there, along with about a third of the people. Then they took offagain and flew to the Himalayan mountains, where Araragat got off with the remaining third of the people. Seven people,however, remained with the ship, flew it back to the Sphinx and lowered it into that room, where it has remained for thelast 13,000 years—until recently when the young woman from Peru raised it again into the open blue skies of MotherEarth’s atmosphere.Sacred Sites on the GridSacred Sites on the GridSacred Sites on the GridSacred Sites on the GridSacred Sites on the GridEgypt became the male component of the grid. That is where the male structures were laid out. There’s hardly anyfemaleness there compared to female areas of the world. Of course, the polarity to maleness does exist— Isis is thatcounterpart—but the overall energy flow is male. South America, especially Peru, Central America and also parts ofMexico became the female component of the grid. However, ultimately the entire female aspect of the grid becamecentered at the complex in Uxmal, in the Yucatan, where many survivors from Atlantis had found refuge.Starting at Uxmal, seven temples are laid out in a spiral, probably a Fibonacci spiral, and they are the seven primarytemples of the female component of the grid. These are chakra centers, just like the chakra centers that are laid out downthe length of the Nile. These feminine centers begin with Uxmal, then go to Labna, then to Kabah, then over to ChichenItza, then over to Tulum near the ocean, then way down near Belize to Kohunlich, curving back inland to Palenque.Those seven places created the primary spiral of the feminine aspect of the grid being created for our new Christconsciousness, which we are only now able to access.From Palenque the feminine aspect of the grid splits north and south. Here we see another polarization of theenergy. The feminine component of the female spiral of the grid heads south and jumps over to Tikal in Guatemala, andthat begins a new octave. When we relate it to music, the seventh site bridges to the eighth note, or the beginning of thenext octave of the next spiral. And the spiral keeps going south through the feminine component of the grid. Eventually itmoves through places like Machu Picchu and Sacsayhuaman near Cuzco, Peru. One of the main spirals ends in a placecalled Chavin, in Peru, which was the primary religious center of the Incan empire. From there it goes to Lake Titicaca toa place about a half a mile off the Island of the Sun in Bolivia. Then it makes a 90-degree turn and heads out towardEaster Island and finally to Moorea, where it anchors into the Earth.Heading north from Palenque is the male component of the female aspect of the grid. It goes through the Aztec ruinsand up through the American Indian pyramids. (The American Indians made physical pyramids, some remains of whichcan be seen in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico.) Then the spiral continues to Blue Lake near Taos, New Mexico,which is the counterpart of Lake Titicaca. This is one of the most important areas in the United States, protected for a long timeby the Taos Indians. Again, there’s a 90-degree turn at Blue Lake. From there the spiral heads out across the mountains, goingthrough Ute Mountain (on the New Mexico side of the Colorado border) and through many mountains and structures that havebeen built."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"117In conjunction with the sacred sites, the creators also used mountains be-cause of their vortex energy. Finally, before the spiral leaves the coast of Cali-fornia, it passes through Lake Tahoe, Donner Lake and Pyramid Lake. Fromthere it goes through underwater mountain complexes until it reaches the Ha-waiian Islands, where Haleakala Crater is one of the primary components, thenheads south again. It goes through the Hawaiian Island chain that connects forthousands of miles all the way back to Moorea.So it’s a huge open circle that comes around the Earth, starting at Uxmal andconnecting at the south pole of the Christ grid. The feminine component of the gridis a massive circle of complexes. Understand that in between each of the majorsites mentioned above are literally hundreds of smaller sites—churches and templesof many religions, sacred sites of nature such as mountain peaks and ranges,lakes, canyons and so on. If you could see the greater plan, you would see howthey form perfect spirals, first moving clockwise, then moving counterclockwise untilthey reach their destination, Moorea, in the South Pacific.The pyramids built in the Himalayan mountains were primarily crystalline innature, meaning they were constructed by using third-dimensional crystals at thecorners, aimed to form a pyramid. They built physical pyramids there, too—lots ofthem. Most of them are not known, though some are. The largest known pyramid inthe world so far is in the western mountains of Tibet. It’s a solid-white pyramid that’sin almost perfect condition, with a huge, solid-crystal capstone. At least two teams ofscientists have been there, and it has also been photographed from the air. It’svisible only three weeks out of the year when its crystal capstone peers out of thedeep snow to view a valley long deserted from human endeavor.I talked with the leader of the team that went into this pyramid. He said it lookslike a brand-new pyramid and that there’s nothing written on the walls. It’s white,smooth and hard, like marble. When they entered it, they went down a long tunnel,where they found a large room in the center. There’s no writing anywhere, no de-signs, no nothing—except that in the middle, high up on a wall, there is one inscrip-tion—the Flower of Life! That’s it. If you want to say everything, all you have to do isput that on a wall. That says it all. By the end of this book you’ll understand why.All the sacred sites on Earth, with a few exceptions, were planned on afourth-dimensional level by higher consciousness, and by now most have third-dimensional counterparts connected to them—in other words, real buildings on"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"118real sites. However, there are still some very important sites that have only fourth-dimensional structures. Those fourth-dimensional pyramids primarily represent the neutral or child energy of the Christ grid. Altogether there are three aspectsof the Christ grid that surround the Earth—Mother, Father and Child. The Father is in Egypt, the Mother is in Peru-Yucatan-South Pacific and the Child is in Tibet.The FThe FThe FThe FThe Five Levels of Human Consciousness and Their Chromosomal Differencesive Levels of Human Consciousness and Their Chromosomal Differencesive Levels of Human Consciousness and Their Chromosomal Differencesive Levels of Human Consciousness and Their Chromosomal Differencesive Levels of Human Consciousness and Their Chromosomal DifferencesAccording to Thoth, there are five different levels of human consciousness possible here on Earth. These are peoplewho have different DNA, completely different bodies and different ways of perceiving the Reality. Each level of con-sciousness grows from the last one, until finally on the fifth level humanity learns how to translate into a whole newmanner of expressing life, leaving Earth forever.The primary visual difference between these types is their height. The first-level people are about 4 to 6 feet tall. Thesecond-level people are about 5 to 7 feet tall, where we are at now. Third-level people are about 10 to 16 feet tall, whichwe are about to translate to. The fourth-level being is about 30 to 35 feet tall, and the last is about 50 to 60 feet. These lasttwo levels are for the distant future.This may seem strange at first, but do we not begin as a microscopic egg and get larger and larger until we are born?Then we continue to grow taller and taller until we are adults. According to this theory, the human adult is not the end ofour growth pattern. We continue through DNA steps until we are 50 to 60 feet tall. Metatron, the Hebrew archangel whois the perfection of what humanity is supposed to become, is 55 feet tall! Remember the giants who lived here on Earthreferred to in chapter 6 of Genesis? According to the Sumerian records, they were about 10 to 16 feet tall. When we lookat a three-year-old and a ten-year-old, we know that they have different levels of consciousness, and it is primarily bytheir height that we make this judgment.According to Thoth, each level of consciousness has different DNA; however, the primary difference is the number ofchromosomes. Using this theory, we are now on the second level and have 44+2 chromosomes. An example of the first levelis certain aboriginal tribes in Australia where they have 42+2 chromosomes. On the third level, which we are about to move to,people have 46+2 chromosomes. The next two levels have 48+2 and 50 + 2, respectively.We will discuss this in depth in the second volume of this book and show the sacred geometry around this under-standing, which will make it clear.The Evidence in Egypt for a New Look at HistorThe Evidence in Egypt for a New Look at HistorThe Evidence in Egypt for a New Look at HistorThe Evidence in Egypt for a New Look at HistorThe Evidence in Egypt for a New Look at HistoryyyyyWe’re now going to focus on Egypt because Egypt happens to be where the main mystery school was located andwhere evidence of the different-sized humans, and levels of consciousness, still remain, though generally unrecognized.Egypt was the area they chose where they would ultimately restore our consciousness, and the primary area wheresurvivors from Atlantis and the ascended masters were in one place. We could discuss the history of those other areas,and we will a little, but the focus for this work will be on the Father, because it is through the Father that the primaryinformation of the Mer-Ka-Ba must be remembered."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"119This is an Egyptian statue of Tiya[Fig. 4-10].

In this photo you see a huge55-foot-tall being with a statue our size standing by his leg.This is the king and queen. Archaeologists don’t know how tointerpret this, so they just say that the kings were more im-portant than the queens, and that’s why they made her little.But it didn’t have anything to do with that. The statues areshowing the five levels of consciousness. Every king andpharaoh who ever lived in Egypt had five names, representingthe five levels of consciousness.Some of the kings and queens were able to translate be-tween the different levels in order to guide the population intothe spiritual realms. One special example of this still exists. InEgypt there’s an ancient round house. I didn’t get to see it,but it was described to me by the famous archaeologist,Ahmed Fayhed, so I know it’s real. This was Ay and Tiya’s house for a long time (though they’re obviously not using itnow). This round house has a wall down the middle. You can’t get from one side of the house to the other without goingoutside, walking around, and coming in the other side. Does this sound like the island of Udal in Atlantis? On one side ofthe middle wall is a picture of Ay, who looks very Egyptian with his angled skirt, beard and various Egyptian parapherna-lia. He appears of normal height. On the other side of the wall Ay’s image is about 15 feet tall. He looks very different, butyou can see that his face is the same. He has a huge skull going way back like the higher-level races do (I’ll show yousome soon). These two pictures of Ay show that he could go back and forth between these two different levels ofawareness by changing consciousness.Stair-Step EvolutionStair-Step EvolutionStair-Step EvolutionStair-Step EvolutionStair-Step EvolutionAccording to Melchizedek knowledge, both the Sumerians and the Egyptians emerged onto the surface of the Earthat almost the same moment, complete, whole and perfect, with their language totally intact, with all their skills andunderstanding and knowledge, with almost no evolution prior to that time (at least none that science knows of). Theysimply appeared at one moment in history in their most perfect state. The writing that came out at that moment wasextremely sophisticated and clear, and has never been improved on since. After that initial impulse, these culturesbecame less and less clear, until finally these advanced civilizations degenerated away. You would think they would getbetter and more sophisticated as time advanced, but that’s not what happened. This is scientific fact. No one in conven-Fig. 4-14. King and queen on different levels of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122tional archaeology knows how this happened or can even explain how it could have happened. It’s a great mystery.Egypt and Sumer are placed into a special category called stair-step evolution by archaeologists. They were giventhis classification because of how they seemed to gain information and knowledge. What happened was, one day Egyptgot its language, full and complete, then that knowledge leveled off; then a little while later they would know everythingyou could possibly imagine about, perhaps, building a certain kind of moat or water system. A little more time would go by,and then they would suddenly know everything about hydraulics. It would keep going on and on like that. How did theEgyptians and the Sumerians get this information? How did they suddenly, in one day, know everything? I’ll give youThoth’s answer.First I need to make this clear on the precession drawing, repeatedbelow [Fig. 4-15]: Point A is where we are now, and point C is whenthe fall of Atlantis happened. Point C is also when the poles shifted;science has determined that’s when it happened. That’s also whenthe Great Flood of Noah happened, and the melting of the icecapsbecause of all the changes that were occurring on Earth. Point Cis when the destruction occurred. Remember, I mentioned ear-lier that there were two other points, B and D, when change couldalso take place and be assimilated most easily. For a 6000-yeartime span, from point C where the destruction happened to point Dwhere new teachings could be given, the ascended masters had tosit and wait while the Atlanteans, who were now hairy barbarians inEgypt, slowly returned to the state where they could accept this new, yet ancient, knowledge. These approximately 1600ascended masters had been living under the Great Pyramid since the Fall, and they had to wait 6000 years before theycould start teaching and building the new culture.The TThe TThe TThe TThe Tat Brotherhoodat Brotherhoodat Brotherhoodat Brotherhoodat BrotherhoodThoth’s son Tat remained in Egypt with Ra after the Fall. Later this group became known as the Tat Brotherhood.Even today there’s an external brotherhood in Egypt called the Tat Brotherhood, physical people who are the protectorsand keepers of the sacred temples. Hidden behind the current Tat Brotherhood are the ascended masters.So the immortal aspect of the Tat Brotherhood sat there waiting and waiting, observing and waiting, until the timewhen the Egyptians could receive their teachings. When that day finally came, which was the birth of Sumer and Egypt,the Tat Brotherhood watched until they found either a person or a group of Egyptians who were ready for the ancientknowledge. Then one, two or three members of the Brotherhood appeared in bodies looking just like the people theywere about to teach. They would go up to the surface, approach the person or group and give them the informationFig. 4-15. The journey of the precession."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"123outright. They flat-out said, “Hey, look at this. Did you know that if you did this and this and this, that this is what willhappen?” The Egyptians would say, “Wow, look at that!” They would use the knowledge, thus creating a new “step” intheir evolution.Then the men and women from the Brotherhood would go back under the pyramid, the Egyptians who were giventhese teachings would give it to the rest of the culture, and the culture would quickly ascend to the next step. TheEgyptians would assimilate that for a while; then the Brotherhood would look for another group that was ready for the nextsubject. They’d go to the surface again and say, “Look, here’s everything you want to know about this.” They simply gaveit to them. The ascended masters gave the people this information over a short period of time and their evolution simplyshot up and up in stair steps.The PThe PThe PThe PThe Parallel Evolution in Sumerarallel Evolution in Sumerarallel Evolution in Sumerarallel Evolution in Sumerarallel Evolution in SumerThis same evolutionary pattern was also occurring in Sumer. Though the present historical line says that Egyptbegan in approximately 3300 B.C. and Sumer began 500 years earlier, in about 3800 B.C., I believe they both started atalmost the same moment. I think that if historians would get their dates accurate, they’d discover that both Sumer andEgypt started only a few years apart. However, the evolution in Sumer was led by the Nefilim, the mother aspect, and theone in Egypt was led by the Sirians, the father aspect. That’s the primary difference. I think the mother and the fatheragreed, “Now is the time for our children to remember.” I believe it was a parental decision, and that when researcherslook very carefully, they’ll find that both countries started to blossom at the same moment in time, which was tied to thepoint in the precessional orbit (point D) when it was most likely to be successful.This is also how the Sumerians knew about the precession of the equinoxes. It takes 2160 years to recognize thatthere is a precession of the equinoxes, but the reason the Sumerians knew about it was because the Nefilim said, “Doyou know there’s a precession of the equinoxes?” Very simple. It’s not a complicated thing. They just explained it all andthe people wrote it down. The Sumerians knew about events that went back 450,000 years because they were given theinformation. They simply wrote it down and applied it.But after these ancient cultures got all this brilliant information, they degenerated. Why would they degenerate in-stead of going higher? Because they were in the sleep cycle, the “falling asleep” portion of the precession. They werefalling more and more asleep with each breath, right into the kali yuga, the most asleep moment of the cycle. In themiddle of the kali yuga—2000 years ago—was the time of Jesus, and humans were sound asleep and snoring. Peoplein the kali yuga who read books and other studies written in the earlier, more-awake period had a difficult time fullyunderstanding what was being written about. Why? Because they were relatively unconscious. This is why cultures allover the world, not just in Egypt and Sumer, degenerated until they ceased. Right now we are about to awaken fully andknow the truth of our beingness."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124Well-Kept Secrets in Egypt,Key to a New View of HistoryThis is Saqqara [Fig. 4-16]. According to the linear ar-chaeological belief, this is where the Egyptian culture began.This pyramid was the first to be built in Egypt, by their way ofthinking. When it was first created, it was covered with beau-tiful white stones. In fact, this whole city stretches for milesand miles and into the Earth hundreds of feet, including build-ings and complexes under the ground. This would have beenamazing if you could have seen it when it was brand new—especially since only a short time in history before it was built,we were supposedly all hairy barbarians. There was a jumpfrom hairy barbarians to this supersophisticated culture in onlya second of archaeological time.This is a pyramid [Fig. 4-17] that I think destroys the beliefthat Saqqara is where it all began. This pyramid is at least 500years older than Saqqara. If this is true, the time when the Egyp-tians emerged on the Earth is identical to the time the Sumeriansemerged— which I believe is exactly what happened. This pyra-mid is called Lehirit (a phonetic spelling), and it’s one of the fewunguarded pyramids in this category. There are quite a few ofthese stepped pyramids, called mastabas. The Egyptians havetaken almost all these pyramids that approach or exceed 6000years of age and put military bases and huge electrical fencesaround them. In some cases they’ve got soldiers on guard withmachine guns. If you try to approach these pyramids, they wouldprobably try to kill you. They don’t want anyone to know aboutthese pyramids, and they especially don’t want you to examinethem. If you try to talk to an Egyptian about them or ask to seethem, they play it down.I went through this. They would say, “Aw, it’s not impor-tant. They’re just made out of little adobe bricks by primitivepeople. They’re nothing, nothing to them.” And I’d say, “Well,Fig. 4-16. The pyramid at Saqqara.Fig. 4-17.

Don’t do it.” I had to keep pushing and pushing because I wanted tosee one. I was brought in to various governmental offices, and I kept saying, “Please, can I just go see one?” And theywould say, “No, no, no.” Finally I had to give bribes to get into these places. One government official wanted $8,000 tosneak me in there at night without any cameras, just to look at it for fifteen minutes, then get away. This is how closelythey protect these structures.Finally, after a long ordeal, I found out about one of these pyramids that was not on a military base because therewas a little village around it about a half an hour from Saqqara. Once I realized that I didn’t have to go through anygovernment red tape, I finally found a person who was connected with that village. I had to pay him a lot of money—itwasn’t thousands, but it was hundreds—to go there. So we drove into the little village; I had to go to the leader to askpermission and pay him money, too. Then I was allowed to go there for thirty minutes but not take any pictures. Imanaged to get this one photograph, and that was all.Not only was this pyramid there, but there were pyramids all over the place everywhere, for what I estimated to be tenmiles around! At one time this was a major complex. They’re not doing anything to take care of it because they know that thispyramid is probably older than 6000 years. So I found out that these “unimportant” pyramids were not so unimportant after all.The stones that covered this pyramid, like the slanting ones shown in Figure 4-17, probably weigh 60 to 80 tons apiece. Theywere very sophisticated even though the internal part of the pyramid was made with adobe bricks.On top of a block beside the base was a circle with a Star of David —the key to the Mer-Ka-Ba experience. Aramp goes down maybe 200 feet to the river below, and the pyramid is still working, still functioning—it’s pumping water.Pyramids pump water; they’ve demonstrated this in the United States now. If you build a pyramid right, it’ll pump waterwith no moving parts. So this pyramid fills up with water and has to be pumped dry before anyone can enter.To top all this off, I just happened to sit next to an American linguistics team when I was flying back home (pure luck,of course), who happened to have just entered this pyramid! Very few people can go in there, but this was a team of 30.He told me about the writing inside that was definitely older than Saqqara. There is geometrical writing all over the walls.I would love to see that. This guy was very excited as he told me that this team of 30 linguistics experts who got to seethe inside now believe that the key to all languages in the world is in that pyramid. I believe he’s probably correct. Heunderstood sacred geometry, and as you will soon discover, sacred geometry is the root of all language in the universe."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126F I V EEgypt’s Role in the Evolution of ConsciousnessIntroduction to Some Basic ConceptsIntroduction to Some Basic ConceptsIntroduction to Some Basic ConceptsIntroduction to Some Basic ConceptsIntroduction to Some Basic ConceptsEgyptian TEgyptian TEgyptian TEgyptian TEgyptian Tools and Symbols of Resurools and Symbols of Resurools and Symbols of Resurools and Symbols of Resurools and Symbols of ResurrectionrectionrectionrectionrectionThe ancients used certain symbols to represent the three aspects of con-sciousness we use for our sojourn here on Earth.

What is the difference? First of all, there’sdying, a process where you go into the void state immediately after death. You’reunconscious, unaware of the dying process to the degree that you have no controlover the images. This way of dying takes you into the third overtone of the fourthdimension, which results in your cycling back into this Earth existence again andagain—reincarnation. Because you’re unconscious in this cycle, you’re not usingyour Mer-Ka-Ba except unconsciously, so once you get to the other side, you don’thave any memories of this side. When you reincarnate back to Earth again, youdon’t have any memories of where you just came from, either. So the reincarnat-ing just keeps going on and on. It’s a lot of energy moving very slowly. You eventu-ally get through it, but it’s a very slow process.When you go through resurrection, you’re aware and conscious of your Mer-Ka-Ba, though usually you don’t become fully aware of it until after you die. Youdie, you drop the body and then you become aware of your Mer-Ka-Ba. Then youre-create your body and go through a process that leads you into either the tenth,eleventh or twelfth overtone of the fourth dimension. From there you don’t go throughreincarnation anymore. Your memory is never blocked again and you continue oninto eternal life.There’s a big difference between dying and resurrection, but there’s an evengreater difference in ascension—which is now possible, since the grid was com-pleted in 1989. Ascension was highly unlikely until this grid was complete. In as-cension you don’t die at all; there’s no death process involved as we know it. Of course, it is true that you no longer areon Earth, and from that point of view, you die. What happens is, you simply become aware of your Mer-Ka-Ba one wayor another—either remembering it on your own, being taught it or however it happens to you. This means you becomeaware of your body as light. Then you’re able to pass through the Void totally consciously—from the Earth side throughthe Void to the higher dimensions, aware the whole time. In this way you simply walk out of this life without going throughthe death process, which involves reconstructing your human body. When a person ascends, he/she simply disappearsfrom this dimension and reappears in the next, passing through the Void.Ascension is now completely possible, and this book is one possible set of instructions on exactly how to accomplishthis process. You personally might not pass through ascension; you might actually die or go through resurrection. Itdoesn’t make much difference at this point in the game of life on planet Earth, because if you die in the normal manner,you’ll go into the third overtone and into a holding pattern for a while. Then when the rest of the Earth cycles through thisFig. 5-4. Resurrecting Osiris."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"129coming change, all people on that third overtone will also rise to the same dimensional level as those who resurrected orascended. Even the Bible refers to this, saying that at this time the dead will rise. There is no such thing as death; thereare just different states of being. It’s a little like water, which can be a liquid, solid (ice) or gas (fog), but it is still water.Right now very few human reincarnations are occurring on Earth except under certain conditions. This is probablyyour last life, folks—this is it! Of course, there are exceptions to almost all rules, so there may be a few on this Earth whohave decided to reincarnate. Time is running out. If we make it to the end of this century, I’ll be amazed. I seriously doubtif the third dimension will still be available for human life by that time. Only God knows for certain. Where are the peoplecoming from who are being born on Earth today? Not from here! I’ll explain when I talk about the new children.When the Sun Rose in the WWhen the Sun Rose in the WWhen the Sun Rose in the WWhen the Sun Rose in the WWhen the Sun Rose in the WestestestestestAs Egypt began to evolve, it developed into two countries, Upper Egyptand Lower Egypt. Upper Egypt was south and Lower Egypt was north. Egyp-tians named Upper and Lower Egypt in this sort of reverse way of thinkingbecause in their earlier life as a country during Atlantis, the Earth was rotat-ing in the opposite direction and the magnetic poles were reversed. Ourpresent north was then south and vice versa. Not only did the poles shifttheir position after Atlantis, but the Earth actually rotated in the oppositedirection. Thoth said that he’s gone through five pole shifts:He’s seen the Sun rise in the east and he’s seen it rise in the west, thenin the east, the west and again the east—five times!On the ceiling of the temple at Dendera, which is the heart chakra ofthe male aspect of the Christ grid, is an astrological zodiac that demon-strates this reversed polarity. The zodiac rotates in the opposite direction,as if the Sun rose in the west instead of the east [Fig. 5-5]. The River Nileflows from south to north, whereas almost all the other rivers in the worldflow from north to south. This indicates to me that the Egyptians held ontothe older energy flow even in the Earth.We are the creators of our universe. People involved in Sufism mayremember Sufi Sam, also known as Murshid Sam Lewis. He was buried—in the early ’70s, I believe—at the Lama Foundation in New Mexico. There’sa plaque over his grave that reads: “On that day the sun will rise in the west, and all men seeing will believe.” He wasreferring to the time that’s coming. When the poles shift this next time, there will be a reversal of the Earth’s rotation, thusthe way we move in relation to the Sun.Fig. 5-5.

It was located on the island of Udal, north of the mainland. They were trying to teach the Atlanteans how tobecome immortal. The only thing is, either they weren’t very good teachers then, or the people just couldn’t get it,because it took 20- to 30,000 years before one person finally achieved the immortal state of being. The first person tomake it was Osiris, who was not Egyptian, but Atlantean. The story of Osiris didn’t happen in Egypt, even though it talksabout the Nile, but in Atlantis. Though most of you know this story, I’ll tell it anyway, in a condensed form.There were two brothers and two sisters from the same family. Their names were Isis, Osiris, Nephthys (or Nefus)andSet. Isis married Osiris and Nephthys married Set. At the point where this story begins, Set killed Osiris. He put Osiris’body in a box and floated it down the Nile, though it was really another river in Atlantis. This killing disturbed Isis, and sheand her sister, Set’s wife, went out to look for Osiris. They found his body and brought it back, intending to bring Osirisback to life. When Set found out, he cut Osiris’ body into fourteen pieces and spread them all over the world so that hissisters could not bring him back to life. Isis and Nephthys then went out looking for these pieces to put him back together.They found thirteen of the fourteen and assembled the pieces, but they never found the phallus, the fourteenth piece. Itwas Thoth (who was in Atlantis as well as Egypt) who, through magic, restored the fourteenth piece. This restored thecreative energy flow, brought Osiris back to life and, in addition, gave him immortality.From the Egyptian point of view, it was through sexual energy that immortality was reached. (Remember, it wasthrough sexual energy, tantra, that immortality took root in Lemuria.) I’m going to leave the last element of this story untilanother appropriate moment, because a certain understanding needs to come first. But notice that Osiris was first alive,walking around in a body in the first level of consciousness. Then he was killed and his body was cut into pieces. He wasseparated from himself—this was consciousness level two, our level. Then his pieces were brought back together and hewas made whole again, which put him into the third level of consciousness, which is immortality.He went through three levels of consciousness. The first one was whole, the second one was separated from itself,and in the third level all the components were brought back together. This made him whole again and also made himimmortal; he would no longer die. When Osiris finally got through all this, he came back as an immortal being, the firstresurrected master of Atlantis. So they used Osiris’s understanding of how he became immortal as the template for howother people could reach the same state of consciousness. This became the religion of Atlantis and later on the religionof Egypt.The Transpersonal Holographic Memory of the First Level of ConsciousnessAtlanteans, because of the way their brains functioned, had complete memory. They remembered everything thathad ever happened to them. And their memory was transpersonal, which means that anything one person remembered,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"131the others in their race could remember. The Aborigines in Australia have this type of memory right now. When anythinghappens to one Aborigine, any other can reexperience it anytime he or she wants. If an Aborigine were to walk into thisroom right now, he or she would in effect be giving the experience to all of their race anywhere on the planet.You see, they’re on the first level of consciousness where they’re not separated from themselves. We’re on thesecond level and are very separated from ourselves. Like the Atlanteans, Aborigines don’t have memory like ourvague kind of recollection; they have full-tilt 3D holographic memory. They could reconstruct this room moment bymoment through the entire workshop, and all the rest of them could walk around in here and look at it. They couldwalk up to your table and look into your eyes. It wouldn’t be real time; it’s what they call Dreamtime, like in a dream,but it’s an absolute replica of the Reality. Their memory is perfect; they don’t have any mistakes or flaws. Obviously,in that kind of culture the Atlanteans had no reason to write anything down. Why try to describe something withwords when you’ve got the real thing?They didn’t need it; however, the Martian aspect did need it, so they had a written language. Even after the Fall, theEgyptians (and others) had an amazing ability to remember. At that point they had lost their holographic and transpersonalmemory, but they still had photographic memory. When the mystery school students were doing the complicated kind oftraining we’ll be doing soon, they could do it all in their head. With our less efficient memory, we cannot do this in the sameway they did; we have to struggle just to remember someone’s name. The complexity will increase as we progress,making it difficult to remember from photo to photo, but the ancient ones could do this completely in their head. There issomething about doing this in your head that’s important, so later I’m going to show you some illustrations that will assistyou to do this yourself.This experience holds a primary key for understanding the nature of creation. Re-create the illustrations that followas if you were actually in the Void moving through the geometrical movements. Experiencing it gives you the understand-ing that the circles on the page represent actual movements, and that these geometrical movements of spirit in the Voidare the beginning and end of creation.The Introduction of Writing, Which Created the Second Level of ConsciousnessThe Forty-Two Books of Thoth record that after the Fall, when the Atlanteans got into Egypt and were no longerexperiencing full memory, writing was introduced. In fact, it’s written right in the Egyptian records that it was Thoth whointroduced writing to the world. This one act completed the “fall” and threw us out of the first level of consciousness andfully into the second, because it changed the way we accessed memory. It sealed our fate.This act of learning how to write caused us to grow the top half of our skull from our eyebrows up. The simple act ofintroducing writing changed many factors in the way we perceive our Reality. To get at our memory now, we have to goin and pull out the desired information with a code. We go in with a word or a concept to bring back the memory ofwhatever it is. In fact, we can’t even remember something without having certain eye movements. Our eyes have to"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132move in certain ways in order for the memories to flow out. The Egyptian memory system was vastly different from theway it was before the Fall. Comparing this change of memory to the Osiris saga, the Egyptians had entered the stagewhere they were in separate pieces, where they were inside their bodies, thinking they were separate from the rest ofReality. This feeling of being separate was, of course, destined to change many aspects of how human beings live.The Roadblock of Polytheism: Chromosomes and NetersNow the plot thickens. Things were going well with the stair-step evolution plan. After a while Upper and Lower Egyptcombined into one country under King Menes and the First Dynasty began. But as time went on, a serious problemdeveloped which, if it had not been solved, would have caused major catastrophes for us in the twentieth century—infact, we would not have survived as a planet. We wouldn’t have had a chance. It seems like a not-so-important thing, butit was very important for some who watch over this planet. It had to do with the religious beliefsof the Egyptians.As I said, the Egyptians no longer had full holographic transpersonal memory anymore, sothey had to write down what their religion was. This writing is called The Forty-Two Books ofThoth. Donald Beaman, who lives in Boston, is the man who reconstructed this book. Therewere 42 books, with two more books set aside from the main body. Forty-two plus two rep-resents the number of chromosomes of the first level of consciousness. Your chromosomes,as you are about to see, are geometric images and patterns that describe the entire Reality—not just your body, but everything in the Reality, from the most distant planet to the smallestplant and every single atom.Inside his book you’ll see what are called neters. Neters are gods, with a small g. This isone of the neters—Anubis [Fig. 5-6]. They are mythical human beings with animal heads, andeach one represents a different chromosome, a different aspect and characteristic of life. Netersrepresent the pathway of how to go from the first to the second level of consciousness. Theascended masters used Osiris’ particular genetic coding to help other people learn how toascend. In other words, Osiris had lived the experience of ascension, and now the pathwaywas in his DNA, specifically the chromosomes. The genetic keys were then opened to theinitiate through the neters, who represented Osiris’ chromosomes.But a problem developed from this way of representing their religion, especially as Upperand Lower Egypt again became more separated. Both Lower and Upper Egypt had 42+2gods, or neters, representing these stages. But Upper Egypt had images slightly different fromthose of Lower Egypt; the images had changed over time when the two countries were sepa-rate. When Menes put the two countries together as a single country called Egypt, in order toFig. 5-6. The neter Anubis."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"133be politically correct he adopted all these images. So now they had 84 + 4 gods representing the same religious ideas.That was probably a big mistake, because it got very confusing. For instance, in one area they would take one of theneters like Anubis and say, “This is God,” with a big G. Another area would say, “Isis is God,” and another area would claimSekhmet to be their God.So then there were 88 different ideas of God in the country. They would say, “My God is the God, and your gods arewrong.” It became very separated and occult, and after a while no one had any idea that there really was only one God.They didn’t understand what the Tat Brotherhood was trying to tell them. From our American point of view, this would belike a chromosome breakage; it was a mutation, and it was not correct. Even with all the help from the Tat Brotherhood,they just couldn’t get it right, and it got worse and worse.All the evidence I’ve seen indicates that the Christian religion came directly out of the Egyptian religion. If you studyboth of them, they’re parallel in every single way except for the Egyptians’ understanding of God. The Christian religioncame back later and totally discounted the Egyptian religion, even though Egypt is the probable source of the origins ofChristianity. The Christians saw the Egyptians as being occult. And they were, but it was because their religious belief hadbecome corrupted, with the clear exception of 17'/2 years during the Eighteenth Dynasty.The Rescue of Human ConsciousnessAkhenaten’s Life: A Brilliant Flash of LightFor a very short period of 171/2 years, a brilliant flash of light appeared, then disappeared again. And that brilliant flashof white light is what saved our spiritual lives. It began in approximately 1500 B.C., when the worshiping and arguing overso many gods was prevalent. The ascended masters finally decided that something must be done. Finally they chose aplan. Thoth told me the following story.As the first step, they decided to bring in an actual Christ-conscious being in an actual Christ-conscious body so wecould put back into the akashic records the memory of what Christ consciousness was all about. It had been lost in theFall. This Christ-conscious body would be much taller than those on the planet at the time. This would be an example forthe Earth people to see. That was the first part of the plan. It was a very bold step, and they did it.The ascended masters had decided that the Christ-conscious person should become king of Egypt. In order to dothis, they had to break all the rules, and I mean all of them. What they did was approach the king of that period, AmenhotepII, and ask him for a favor. Thoth simply walked into the room physically, went right up to him and said, “Look, I’m Thoth,”which I’m sure was difficult for the king to believe. By that time the Egyptians probably thought that all those neters in their"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134stories were mythical. Yet here’s a real person standing there who was one of the neters. Thoth said, “We have a seriousproblem here in Egypt, and I need your help.”Thoth somehow got Amenhotep II to do something that no Egyptian king would ever do. Amenhotep’s son was about tobecome king, and Thoth said, “I want your son to not become king; I want to put an outside lineage onto the Egyptian throne.”Amenhotep II agreed to it. It must have been a pretty profound experience, I don’t know what Thoth did—he probably came inglowing or levitating or something like that. But he did something to convince the king that it was necessary. Once they receivedthe king’s permission, they had to actually create the living body, which was not easy.Creating the Bodies of Akhenaten, then NefertitiSo how did they do this? They went to Ay and Tiya—who were very, very old, no matter how you look at it—and said,“We would like you to have a baby.” They had to go to someone who was immortal to get the immortal genes, becausethey have a different chromosome count—46 + 2 instead of 44 + 2. Ay and Tiya agreed, and they had a little baby. Thebaby was given to Amenhotep II to become the next king.So the little baby grew up and became king. He became Amenhotep III, who then mated; I am not sure if it wasphysically or interdimensionally, and I don’t know who it was, but he would almost have had to mate with someone whohad the higher chromosome levels. Anyway, their baby boy became known as Amenhotep IV, and that baby was the onethey had special plans for. That baby, Amenhotep IV, has a more popular name, which you know asAkhenaten.Meanwhile Ay and Tiya waited a generation and then had another baby. That baby was a littlegirl whose name was Nefertiti. Nefertiti grew up with Akhenaten, and then they married. Theywere really brother and sister because they had the same bloodline. The Osiris story is similar—brother and sister marrying and becoming a new possibility in life. So these two people grew upand became the king and queen of Egypt.The New Rulership and the One GodThe New Rulership and the One GodThe New Rulership and the One GodThe New Rulership and the One GodThe New Rulership and the One GodFor a while Amenhotep III and his son Akhenaten ruled the country together—two kings atthe same time, again breaking the rules. Meanwhile they built a brand new city called Tel el Amarnain the exact center of Egypt. We still don’t know how they got it in the exact center. Akhenaten put astone there that says, “This is the center of the country.” Today we could not have done it better from asatellite. It makes you wonder who these people were who could locate right down to the square inch the center of acountry hundreds of miles long. It’s pretty amazing. They built an entire city out of white stones. It was beautiful—it wasspace-age."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"135Akhenaten and his father ruled the country simultaneously from two places for a while—from Thebes and from Tel elAmarna. The father resigned the throne while he was still alive—which again breaks the rules—and gave the country toAkhenaten, who then became the first pharaoh of Egypt. There were no pharaohs before Akhenaten, only kings. Pha-raoh means that which you will become. In other words, theywere showing the people what they would literally become inthe future. Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their children were not ex-actly human.This tall figure [Fig. 5-7] is Akhenaten. I’m going to talk aboutthis picture for a moment. Akhenaten’s main purpose wasto break up all the occult religions and bring the country back toa single religion where they believed that there was simply oneGod. At that time all the people were worshiping statues, sothey were used to believing in things. Akhenaten had to givethem something to see to believe in, so he gave them the im-age of the Sun as God, because this image was somethingthey couldn’t stick on their altars again.There was another reason he gave them the image of theSun. He told them that the breath of life, the prana field, camefrom the Sun. This is true in terms of third-dimensional thinking,though prana is really anywhere and everywhere—there areinfinite amounts of it at any point. Since prana also comes fromthe Sun, this image shows the Sun’s rays coming down; and ontwo of the rays are little ankhs, which the rays are holding up tothe nose, to the breath, showing that eternal life is through thebreath.In this same picture you also see the lotus, the nationalflower of Atlantis. It was the Naacals who brought the lotus toIndia. The Naacals are written about in Indian Sanskrit writingsand are talked about even in modern times. They came longbefore Buddha and were there during Buddhist times. In Egyptthe lotus flower represented Atlantis, and in this picture you seethem out of the vases.

Andwe’re going to change our art so that it reflects the total truth.” So during the Eigh-teenth Dynasty— never before nor after—there was a totally unique art form. Theartists were instructed to sculpt or paint things just as their eyes saw it, like a photo-graph. So began an art that looked realistic instead of stylized, as it had beenbefore. You see ducks that look like ducks [Fig. 5-9], just like we see in modern art. This is important to remember whenyou’re looking at art of the Eighteenth Dynasty, because that means that whatever you see is exactly what the artist saw.They were not allowed to lie.Fig. 5-9.Truth in ducks.Fig. 5-8.

When I stood next tothis, the top of my head came upto the widest part of his hips.Nefertiti was ten feet-something.She was actually small for herrace. The daughters were alsovery tall. This is according to Thoth.Hard evidence of this has recentlycome into official hands, and theydon’t know what to think about it.They found two caskets in Tel elAmarna, Akhenaten’s city.This issue about truth wastaken to such an extreme thatthey were not even allowed towear clothes, because wearingclothes was hiding, and that wasa form of lying. No one was al-lowed to wear clothes during the Eighteenth Dynasty except for ceremonial andother special purposes.This neter’s name is Maat [Fig. 5-10]. That’s a feather on top other head. Shebecame one of the most important neters in this new religion because of her name,which translates as truth or truthfulness. She was the important issue in everything.Everything was to be absolutely truthful, and there were to be no distortions, no lies,so that everything could get back into focus. This was an important part of Akhenaten’steachings.One of the caskets had the Flower of Life etched directly over the head ofthe mummy inside, and the second casket held the bones of a seven-year-oldboy—but he was eight feet tall! That casket is sitting in the basement of the CairoMuseum at this moment—at least it probably is. It’s the only real proof so far ofwhat these bodies looked like.

Notice theshape of his skull.Memory: The Key to ImmortalityYou might wonder, If Akhenaten andothers were immortal, then why are theydead? I’ll give you the definition of immor-tality from a Melchizedek point of view,which hopefully will help. Somebody else may have a different definition,but this is what we feel. Immortality has nothing to do with living in thesame body forever. You’re going to live forever anyway; you have always been alive and you always will be, but youmight not be conscious during all that time. The definition from our point of view has to do with memory. When youbecome immortal, you reach the point where your memory remains intact from then on. In other words, you’re consciousfrom then on, with no unconsciousness coming in. It means you stay in the body as long as you want to, and when youwant to leave it, you leave. To have to stay in a single body forever would be a jail or a trap, because it means you couldn’tleave. There might be a reason for leaving that body, and you will eventually find that you want to go beyond whereveryou are. This is the definition of eternal life: Simply put, you have continuous, unbroken memory.Back now to what happened after Akhenaten was dethroned. In order to let things get back to the old ways, whichthey wanted to do, the country went into a transitional state. The people who became king and queen directly after himare almost comical—they let Ay and Tiya take over the country. We have a long time lag here, then they became king andqueen. It’s written right in the records. They took over for around thirty years, and then they gave it to Seti I, who becamethe first king of the Nineteenth Dynasty. He immediately changed everything back to the old way, erased everything andcalled Akhenaten the same name they called Jesus—”the criminal.” He called him the worst king who ever lived becauseof his teaching that there was only one God.Fig. 5-23. Kalu Rinpoche.Fig. 5-21. Museum in Lima."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"144What Really Happened to Akhenaten?Most of Egypt hated Akhenaten, except for a small group. The priesthood hated him most of all because Egyptianreligious beliefs were centered on the priests. They controlled the people, their way of life and the economy. They be-came rich and were more powerful than anybody else. Then Akhenaten came along and said, “You don’t need priests;God is within you. There is only one God, and you can access God from within your own self.” The priests reacted toprotect themselves and their vested interests. Also, Egypt had the most powerful military in the world, and when Akhenatenbecame pharaoh, they were chomping at the bit, ready to go out and take over the world. Akhenaten said no. He was acomplete pacifist and said, “Come back onto our soil. Do not attack anyone unless you’re attacked.” He made the militarycome back and sit by idly, and they didn’t like that.So he had not only the priesthood, but the military against him. On top of that, the people themselves were into theirlittle religions, and they loved worshiping their little gods. This wouldn’t ultimately do them any good—it wouldn’t get themwhere they needed to go according to the DNA plan of the universe—which was back home to God, to the one God—butnevertheless they were really into what they were doing.When the people were forcefully told that they could no longer do certain religious acts, this caused great animositytoward Akhenaten. It would be like our president saying, “Okay, there are no more religions in the United States; there’sjust the president’s religion.” And if the president brought all the military back onto American soil with an isolationist pointof view, he wouldn’t be very popular. Neither was Akhenaten. But he knew that he had to do it no matter what, even if itmeant his own death. He had to do it to correct the pathway that our collective DNA had encoded into the Reality. Inaddition, he needed to put into the akashic records the memory of the sacred purpose that Christ consciousness held.So what happened then? According to the accepted history, the priesthood and the military got together and gaveAkhenaten a poison that killed him. According to Thoth, that is not exactly what happened, because they couldn’t kill him.He could drink the poison, but it wouldn’t hurt him. They did something much more exotic. Thoth says that the priesthoodhired three black Nubian sorcerers, who made a concoction similar to what is used in Haiti today to make someone lookdead. It was given to Akhenaten at a public meeting called by the priesthood and the military. After Akhenaten drank theliquid, all life signs appeared to stop. As soon as the royal doctor pronounced him dead, they rushed him off to a specialroom where they had a sarcophagus waiting. They placed him in the sarcophagus, put on the lid with a magical seal andburied it in a hidden place. Thoth said that Akhenaten had to wait inside the sarcophagus for almost 2000 years before apiece of the seal broke away and the magic was broken. He then returned to the Halls of Amenti. This was not a problemfor Akhenaten. Thoth said that to an immortal being like Akhenaten, it was more like a nap. My question is, did he reallyallow this to happen to him?"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"145AkhenatenAkhenatenAkhenatenAkhenatenAkhenaten’s Myster’s Myster’s Myster’s Myster’s Mystery Schooly Schooly Schooly Schooly SchoolWhat’s important here is one fact: Akhenaten developed a mystery school. The school was called the EgyptianMystery School of Akhenaten, the Law of One. As it turned out, he had only 171/2 years to produce results. He broughtstudents from the Left Eye of Horus (the feminine side) Mystery School, which I’ll talk about later—graduates who wereat least 45 years old—into the Right Eye of Horus Mystery School. This right-eye information had never been taughtbefore in Egypt. He taught them for twelve years, after which he had only five and a half years to see if he could get themto live immortality. And he did it! He got about 300 people into immortality. I believe they were all, or almost all, women.Someone once asked, “Why didn’t Akhenaten work with the population in a different way so as to not get himself intosuch a dangerous situation?” But can you think of a way to change a whole population in such a short time withoutcausing strife? Could you do that in the United States right now—in one year bring all religions into one? I don’t think thereis a way except to just do it, even if it means getting “killed.” Besides, the only thing he really needed to do was simply livehis life. It would get into the akashic records and be a memory that we all have in our DNA. One day alone would get itencoded, then afterward they could do whatever they wanted with him. He wasn’t really concerned about it. He knew thatthe country, the society and the customs would all go back to the old way. But he did have these 300 immortal people whowould go on beyond him and Egypt. .The Essene Brotherhood and Jesus, MarThe Essene Brotherhood and Jesus, MarThe Essene Brotherhood and Jesus, MarThe Essene Brotherhood and Jesus, MarThe Essene Brotherhood and Jesus, Mary and Josephy and Josephy and Josephy and Josephy and JosephAfter Akhenaten was gone, the 300 immortal Egyptians joined the Tat Brotherhood and waited from roughly 1350B.C. to about 500 B.C.—about 850 years or so. Then they migrated to a place called Masada, Israel, and formed theEssene Brotherhood. Even today Masada is known as a capital of the Essene Brotherhood. These 300 people becamethe inner circle, and mostly ordinary people formed an outer circle, which became very large.Mary, the mother of Jesus, was one of the members of the inner circle of the Essene Brotherhood. She was immortaleven before Jesus became immortal. Joseph came from the outer circle. This is according to Thoth; it’s not written in therecords. It was part of the Egyptian plan that the next step would be to bring in someone who would demonstrate exactlyhow to become immortal when starting as an ordinary human, put the experience into the akashic records and make itreal. Somebody had to do it. According to Thoth, Mary and Joseph came together and mated interdimensionally (whichwe’ll talk about later) to create the body for Jesus, which would allow his consciousness to come in from a very, very highlevel. When Jesus first came in, he began life on Earth as human as any of us. He was totally human. And through hisown work he transformed himself to the immortal state through resurrection, not through ascension, and put into theakashic records the process of exactly how to do it. This is according to Thoth, and it was planned a long, long time beforeit ever took place."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"146The TThe TThe TThe TThe Two Mysterwo Mysterwo Mysterwo Mysterwo Mystery Schools and the 48 Chromosomal Imagesy Schools and the 48 Chromosomal Imagesy Schools and the 48 Chromosomal Imagesy Schools and the 48 Chromosomal Imagesy Schools and the 48 Chromosomal ImagesWe’re now changing direction again and beginning a new system of knowledge that will continue for a while until yousee this symbol again a long way down the line.

The right eye is controlled by the left brain; it’s male knowledge.Although the right eye “sees” directly to the right brain, this is not what the Egyptians were communicating. It is not the“seeing” but rather the interrupting of the “seeing” information that was important here. Itis the left brain that makes this interruption of what is seen; it controls the right side of thebody, and vice versa. In the same manner, the Left Eye of Horus, controlled by the rightbrain, is female knowledge, which was taught in the twelve primary Egyptian templesalong the Nile. The thirteenth temple was the Great Pyramid itself. It took twelve years ofinitiation, spending a year, one cycle, in each of these temples learning all the femininecomponents of consciousness.But the male component, the Right Eye of Horus, was taught only once, and it wasnot written down anywhere. It was purely an oral tradition, though its primary componentsare etched on a single wall under the Great Pyramid that leads into the Hall of Records.As you go down that hall, you get almost to the bottom, and just before it makes a 90-degree turn, high up on the wall you see an image about four feet in diameter, which is theFlower of Life. Beside it you would see 47 other images, one after another, which are theimages of the chromosomes of Christ consciousness, the level of consciousness we’removing into now. After these two volumes are published, we may publish a book of these images.These images will be given throughout this book, mixed up and in slightly different form. This is what the Great Pyramid isall about. Its primary purpose, beyond anything else, is to take someone from our level of consciousness into the next level.There are lots of other reasons why it’s in existence, but ascension and resurrection are the absolute purpose.Fig. 5-24. Symbol for the Right Eye ofHorus Mystery School."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"147Genesis, the Creation StoryEgyptian and Christian VersionsWe’re going to begin with a realization that the Christian and the Egyptian understandings of Reality are almostidentical. The Christian understanding is derived from the Egyptian. Here are the first three sentences of the ChristianBible: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darknesswas upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, ‘Let there be light,’and there was light.”To begin with, this statement that the Earth was without form until it came out of the Void, out of nothing, is exactlywhat the Egyptians believed. It’s also what many other religions believe. Both Egyptian and Christian religions believethat all that’s needed to start the process of creation is nothing and spirit, and when those two concepts are broughttogether, then all things can be created. They believe that creation begins by the movement of spirit. In the secondsentence it says, “The earth was without form and void” and that the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.Then in the very next sentence, God says, “Let there be light.” The movement happened first, then the light happenedimmediately after.According to the Egyptian belief, one tiny detail was left out of the current Christian Bibles. It isn’t necessarilywrong in the older Bibles, though. There are 900 versions of the Bible in the world, and in many of the older ones thefirst sentence says, “In the beginning there were six.” It starts out in other ways too; it’s been changed many timesover the years.The ancient Egyptians would say that the way our modern Bibles begin creation is impossible, especially if you think aboutit from a physics point of view. Imagine a dark, infinite space that goes on forever and ever in all directions. There’s nothing init—just infinite space with nothing in it. Imagine yourself—not your body, but your consciousness—being in the middle of that.You’re just floating there with nothing. You can’t really fall, because where would you fall to? You wouldn’t know if you’re fallingdown or going up or off to the side; in fact, there’s no way to experience any motion at all.From a purely physics or mathematical point of view, motion itself, or kinetic energy, is absolutely impossible in avoid. You can’t even rotate, because motion cannot become real until there’s at least one other object in the spacearound you. There has to be something to move relative to. If you don’t have something relative to move to, how wouldyou know you’re moving? I mean, if you went up thirty feet, how would you know that? There’s no change. With nochange, there’s no movement. So the ancient Egyptians would say that before God “moved upon the face of the waters,”He/She had to first create something to move relative to."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"148How God and the MysterHow God and the MysterHow God and the MysterHow God and the MysterHow God and the Mystery Schools Did Ity Schools Did Ity Schools Did Ity Schools Did Ity Schools Did ItNow, think of yourself standing in a dark room, near the door to a second room. You are ready to go into the secondroom, which is very, very dark. You can barely see the door leading into it. You go into the second room, close the doorbehind you, and it’s pitch black.When you’re faced with that situation, you have the ability to project a sensing beam from your third-eye area, andyou can also sense from your hands. (You can actually sense from any chakra, but people usually do it from their thirdeye or their hands.) You can project a beam of consciousness into that dark room for a certain distance. It might go onlyan inch, or maybe you can feel outward a foot or two, and you just know that nothing (or something) is in that space. Yourconsciousness goes out this distance and then it stops. Your knowingness quits, and you don’t know what’s beyond that.You probably all know what I’m talking about, though a lot of us have allowed that sense to retreat because we rely on oureyes so much.But some people, especially the ancient Egyptians, were really good at this. They could go into a dark room and feelall around and know if anything was there even though they couldn’t see a thing with their eyes. There are blind peoplewho can also demonstrate this ability.We actually have six of these sensing rays—not just one, but six. They all come from the center of our heads, thepineal gland. One ray comes out the front of our head at the third eye and another goes out the back; one goes out of theleft and another out of the right side of our brain; and another goes straight up through the crown chakra and the sixthstraight down through our neck—the six directions. These are the same directions of the x-y-z axes of geometry. TheEgyptians believed that this innate aspect of consciousness is what allows creation to begin. They believed that if wedidn’t have this ability, creation would never have happened.In order to understand this process of creation on the deepest level, Egyptian studentswere told to imagine and enact the process we are about to go through. The followingdescription is how they explained and practiced it in their mystery schools. The way theylearned isn’t the only way it could have been done, but this is how they were trained.The dark background in this picture represents the Great Void, and the little eyerepresents the spirit of God [Fig. 5-25]. So here’s the spirit of God existing in the Void,out in nothing. Imagine that you’re that little spirit in the middle of the Void. (When you’rein the Great Void, by the way, you will realize that you and God are one, that there is nodifference at all.) After hanging out in the Void for a long time, you probably would getbored or curious or lonely, and you would want to try something new, to have some newadventure in your life.Fig. 5-25. Spirit of God in the greatVoid."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"149First Create a SpaceSo spirit, the single Eye, shoots a beam of consciousness out into the Void. It shoots thisbeam first to the front, then to the back, then to the left, then the right, then straight up andstraight down [Fig. 5-26]. Realize that whatever distance you project out front, you project thesame distance out back, also to the left, the right and up and down. The consciousness beamprojects the same distance in all six directions for any one individual. Even though each one ofus is different in how far we can project this beam (one of us might project an inch, another twofeet and another fifty feet), there is equality in all six directions. So spirit projects those beamsoutward in those six directions, defining space: north, south, east, west, up and down.This might be why the American Indians and native people all around the world find thesix directions so important. Have you ever noticed this in their ceremonies, how important itis that they define the directions? It’s also important in the Kabala, in some of the meditationsthey do.Next, Enclose the SpaceIn the mystery schools, after they’ve projected these six beams in the six directions, the nextthing they do is connect the ends of these projections. This forms a diamond, or square, aroundthem [Fig. 5-27]. Of course, when it’s at the angle shown in this diagram, it looks like a rectangle,but you can see that it would actually be a square. So they make a little square around their pointof consciousness. Then from the square they send a beam up to the top, forming a pyramidaround the base of the square [Fig. 5-28].After they create the pyramid on top, they then send a beam down to the bottom point,forming a pyramid below [Fig. 5-29]. If you look at this in actual 3D space,the two back-to-back pyramids form an octahedron. Here’s another ren-dition of the octahedron [Fig. 5-30].Remember that this is just spirit. You don’t have a body in the GreatVoid; you’re just spirit. So you’re in the Great Void, and you’ve createdthis field around you. Now, once you’ve defined the space by mappingout the Fig. 5-30. Octahedron around spirit, octahedron with two back-to-back pyramids, you have an object. Kinetic energy or movement isnow possible; something is now possible that was not possible before.Spirit can move outside the shape and move around it.

The other thing spirit can do isremain stationary in the middle of the shape, letting the shape move instead. The shape can rotate or wobble or move inall possible ways. So relative movements are now possible.Then Spin the Shape to Create a SphereThen Spin the Shape to Create a SphereThen Spin the Shape to Create a SphereThen Spin the Shape to Create a SphereThen Spin the Shape to Create a SphereThe octahedron the students created this way had three axes—front to back, left to right, and up and down. Theywere told to spin the shape around one of the axes—it didn’t matter which, and it didn’t matter which direction. Theywould spin it one way or the other, then they would spin the shape once around another axis, and once around the thirdaxis. With just one spin around each of the three axes, they traced the parameters of a perfect sphere. Before thestudents were allowed to move their own point of consciousness, they were taught to spin this octahedral form andcreate a sphere around themselves.It has been agreed upon by everyone involved in sacred geometry that I know of, that a straight line is male and anycurved line is female. Thus one of the most male forms is a square or a cube, and one of the most female forms is a circleor a sphere. Since the octahedron that spirit projected is made up of only straight lines, it’s a male shape; and since thesphere is made of only curved lines, it’s a female shape. What the Egyptians did was to create a male form and thenconvert it to a female form. They went from maleness to femaleness.This same story is related through the Bible where Adam was created first, and then from Adam, or out of Adam’s rib,was created the female. Of course, the image of spirit inside the sphere is also the image of the school.Sacred geometry started when spirit made its first projection into the Void and created the first octahedron arounditself. The Void is infinite—nothing in it—and these forms being created are also nothing.They’re just imaginary lines created out of consciousness. This gives you an indication ofwhat Reality is—nothing. The Hindus call Reality maya, which means illusion.Spirit can sit in the middle of its first creation for a long time [Fig. 5-31], but eventually it’llmake a decision to do something. To re-create this process, mystery school students weregiven instructions to reenact the same motions that spirit took. Two simple instructions are allthat’s required to create and complete everything in the entire universe.The FThe FThe FThe FThe First Motion in Genesisirst Motion in Genesisirst Motion in Genesisirst Motion in Genesisirst Motion in GenesisRemember that spirit is now sitting in a sphere. The instructions are to move to thatwhich is newly created, then project another sphere exactly like the first. That does some-thing very special and unique. This is an absolutely foolproof system for creating Reality.You cannot make a mistake no matter what you do. All you do is move to what is newlycreated and project another sphere the same size as the first one. In this system, sinceFig. 5-31. Spirit in the middle of its firstcreation."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"151nothing exists except this bubble in the Void, and the inside of the bubble is the same asthe outside, the only thing that’s new or different is the membrane itself, the surface ofthe sphere.So consciousness decides to go to the surface. It makes no difference where it goeson the surface; it can go anywhere. It doesn’t make any difference how it gets thereeither, whether it goes in a straight line or curves or spirals out or explores every speck ofspace in between. It can be really creative; it doesn’t make any difference. But somehowor another it will end up somewhere on the surface of the sphere.For purposes of this example we’ll say spirit went up to the top (just to be symmetri-cal and easier to deal with). Anyway, spirit, this little single eye, lands on the surface [Fig.5-32]. It has just made the first motion in Genesis: “And the spirit of God moved upon theface of the waters.” And the very next thing was: “God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and therewas light.”At this point spirit knows how to do only one thing—actually, it knows how to do twothings, but the end result is one. It knows (1) how to project the little octahedron and create asphere and (2) how to move to what’s newly created. That’s it, a very simple Reality. So onceit arrives on the surface, it makes another octahedron, spins it through the three axes andforms another sphere identical in size to the first one. It’s identical in size because its ability toproject into the Void is the same. Nothing has changed in that respect. So it creates a secondsphere exactly the same size as the first.The VThe VThe VThe VThe Vesica Piscis, through Which Light Is Createdesica Piscis, through Which Light Is Createdesica Piscis, through Which Light Is Createdesica Piscis, through Which Light Is Createdesica Piscis, through Which Light Is CreatedWhen it does that, it has done something that, in terms of sacredgeometry, is very special. It has formed a vesica piscis at the intersectionof the two spheres [Fig. 5-33]. Have you ever seen two soap bubblestogether? When two soap bubbles intersect, a line or a circle goes aroundtheir linkage. If you were looking at the two bubbles from the side, thenewly formed section would look like a line, but if you were looking downat the two bubbles from the top, you would see the newly created form’scircumference inside the larger spheres.The vesica piscis circumference is symmetrical to, and smaller than,the circumference of the larger spheres. In other words, it would appearfrom the side like a straight line [Fig. 5-34, center], and from the top like aFig. 5-32. Spirit’s first motion.Fig. 5-33.

Even though the vesica piscis is usually two-dimensional like a coin, its three-di-mensional aspect is just as valid. If you were to take it out of the middle of the two spheres, itwould look similar to a football, like Figure 5-35.I cannot prove this to you now, but later in this book I’ll be able to prove that this image islight. It’s the geometric image through which light was created. It’s also the geometric imagethrough which your eyes were created, which receive light. Besides light, it’s also the image ofthe patterns that are connected to your emotions and many, many other aspects of life. This isthe basic geometry of the electromagnetic field. It’s too simple to understand here. I have to waituntil things get more complex; then I can explain it. I’ll show you that the first motion of Genesiscreates the pattern that is life. That’s the reason why God said, “Let there be light.” He couldn’tsay that until He had projected the second sphere and made the vesica piscis.The Second Motion Creates the Star TThe Second Motion Creates the Star TThe Second Motion Creates the Star TThe Second Motion Creates the Star TThe Second Motion Creates the Star TetrahedronetrahedronetrahedronetrahedronetrahedronWhen spirit is in the center of its second sphere and looking down at the vesica piscis, it’slooking upon a newly formed circle, the circle of the vesica piscis. This circle is the only thingthat’s new, and spirit’s instructions are to go to what’s newly created. It doesn’t make any differ-ence where it goes on the new circle. It cannot make a mistake; it just moves to somewhere onthat circle and projects a new sphere as in Figure 5-36.No matter where spirit lands, we can rotate the spheres to look like this drawing. So I’mgoing to say that it moved on the circle to point A, on the left. At that moment a huge amount ofinformation was created (in every motion of Genesis, vast amounts of knowledge come out).The first creation produced the sphere. The first motion/day produced the vesica piscis, which isthe basis of light. The second motion/day produced, in the interpenetrating relationship betweenthe three spheres, the basic geometries of the star tetrahedron [Fig. 5-37], which you will soonsee is one of the most important shapes for life.We’re not going to get into all the information that was formed at this time, but each time anew sphere is formed, more and more information unfolds and more and more creative patternsbecome visible. After the first and second motions have taken place—from anywhere on thesphere to anywhere on the circle (no matter how spirit moved, no matter where it went on thecircle/sphere, it will always be perfect)—it will begin to move exactly on the equator of the originalsphere. There are an infinite number of equators on that sphere, but it will choose a perfect one.Fig. 5-35.

The onlyother action to be taken until the end of time is always to move to the innermost circle point(s)and project another sphere.For the sake of clarity, let’s define what we mean by “innermost circle point.” Look at Figure 5-36.In this case there are three innermost circle points. If your eye were to trace the outside perimeter ofthis pattern, it would come to three places that are the closest places to center. It is these “closestplaces to center” that we are calling the innermost circle points. In the case of the Genesis patternthat this movement of spirit is creating, there are six innermost circle points.So with this in mind, spirit starts moving exactly around the equator of the original or centralsphere. When it has traversed the full 360 degrees and reaches the point at which it started (whichwill be six points or movements) , it begins to follow its second impulse (or instruction, for the mysteryschool students): Move to the innermost circle points, which are now located on the circumference ofthe original sphere where two vesica pisces intersect. Simply put, they are the points as close aspossible to the outside of the pattern. That continual movement begins to form a vortex. This vortexmotion creates different types of three-dimensional forms, one after another, which are the buildingblocks or blueprints of the entire Reality.Once spirit has created the third sphere, it now moves to the innermost circle point andprojects another sphere [Fig. 5-38]. There is information here, but it is too complex to discuss atthis time.This is very interesting; it is the fourth motion/day [Fig.5-39]. It says in many Bibles in the world that on the fourthday of Genesis exactly one half of creation was completed.Starting from the first motion, exactly one half of the circle wasformed [Fig. 5-39a]. We havemoved exactly 180 degreesfrom the point of the first mo-tion.Figure 5-40 is the fifth dayof Genesis—more information.And then on the sixth day[Fig. 5-41] a geometric miracletakes place:Fig. 5-38.

This is what many of the earlier Bibles meant when they said, “Inthe beginning there were six.” Our Bible now says that creation was formed in six days, and this fits exactly.

This is why I spend so much time going through this near thebeginning of this course. Later on we’ll get more complex, but for now this is just the beginning of how the manifestationof Reality is created.We’ll pull these 3D shapes off the page in a minute, one by one. If they could be made solid, you could look at themand hold them in your hands. We will begin to ground this abstract information into Reality for you. Then we’re going totake them further to show you how they actually create the Reality we live in. If you study this on your own, you’ll be seeingsome extremely elaborate aspects of creation come from this explanation of the Reality. If you were constructing thesegeometries yourself, you would draw a line somewhere in the sacred geometry that spirit makes as it moves through theVoid, and it’ll mean something amazing; then another line will mean something else even more amazing. Life begansimply, then created the complex world we live in.This is not just mathematics, and it’s not just circles or geometries.

If you look at a math book, this Genesis pattern has theminimal amount of lines that can be drawn on a flat surface to delineate the three-dimensional form called a torus. A torus is formed when you rotate the Genesispattern around its central axis, creating a shape that looks like a doughnut, butthe hole in the middle is infinitely small.A torus, here called a tube torus because this particular one is shaped like aninner tube [Fig. 6-1 ], is unique in that it’s able to fold in on itself, turning eitherinward or outward. No other shape in existence can dothis or anything similar. A torus is the first shape thatcomes out of the completed Genesis pattern andis absolutely unique among all forms in existence.It was Arthur Young who discovered that thereare seven regions on this shape, which are collec-tively called the seven-color map. You can pick upalmost any mathematics book, and if you go tothe torus, it’ll talk about the seven-color map.

It’s perfect, flawless.In sacred geometry there’s something called ratcheting. You take a circle ora line and ratchet it, like when you take a ratchet tool in car mechanics anduse it to rotate something a certain distance. For instance, imagine two Gen-esis patterns superimposed on each other. One pattern is fixed; if yourotate the other pattern 30 degrees, you would have twelve spheresaround the central one. It would look like this [Fig. 6-2] in two dimensions.In three dimensions it would look like a tube torus. Then if you connect allpossible lines in the middle, you get this pattern [Fig. 6-3].Ratcheting the twelve spheres once more, this time 15 degrees,so that there are 24 spheres, you would get this pattern [Fig. 6-4].This pattern has what is called a transcendental pattern associatedwith it. What is a transcendental pattern? A transcendental number inmathematics, from my way of looking at it, is a number that comes fromanother dimension. In that dimension it is probably whole, but when it getshere it does not completely translate into this world. We have a lot of those.One of them, for example, is the phi ratio, which I’m going to talk about later.It’s a mathematical proportion that starts out with 1.6180339and continues forever, meaning you never know what thenext. digit is going to be, and it never ends: people have letcomputers run for months without coming to an end. As asimple explanation, that’s what a transcendental number is.The shape of the torus is what governs many aspectsof our lives. For example, the human heart has sevenmuscles that form a torus, and it pumps in the seven re-gions shown in the map of the torus. We have embodied allknowledge. The torus is literally around all life forms, all at-oms, and all cosmic bodies such as planets, stars, galaxiesand so on. It is the primary shape in existence.“In the beginning was the Word.” I believe that time willreveal that language/conscious sound/the word will all berevealed in the torus.

This is found all over the world—everywhere from China to Tibet to England to Ireland to Peru to theAmerican Indians.One was just found in Egypt. You’ll find this labyrinth on the floors ofmany of the churches in Europe. The same form is on stone walls ev-erywhere. It must have been of great importance to ancient mankind.There are seven regions in it, which relates to the torus and to thebeating of the human heart. Later on I’ll be talking about the ancientDruid mystery school on the Island of Avalon in England. To get to thetop of the hill there, you have to walk through this same labyrinth, goingback and forth through this motion.While I was in England, I spoke to Richard Feather Anderson, who isan author and an expert on labyrinths, and I learned something. As part of hisresearch, he has people walk through the labyrinth. He’s discovered that when youwalk through it, you are forced to move through different states of consciousness,giving you a very specific experience. It causes the life-force energy to move throughthe chakras in the following pattern: three, two, one, four, seven, six, five. The en-ergy starts in the third chakra, then goes to the second, then to the first; then itjumps up to the heart (fourth), then into the center of the head to the pineal gland(seventh), then to the front of the head to the pituitary Inland (sixth), and then downinto the throat (fifth).When you walk this labyrinth, unless you block the experience, you williutomatically move through these changes. Evenif you don’t know about :hese things, you will gothrough the experiences anyway. People all over:he world have found this to be true. Mr. Andersonbelieves that if you Iraw lines (the number of linesindicating which of the seven paths it is) in :he or-der you walk the path—three, two, one, four,seven, six, five—it forms what looks like a cup [Fig.6-6].

Once theconsciousness projects the first seven spheres and completes this Genesis pattern, itthen continues moving in a rotational pattern from each consecutive innermost placeuntil it completes its second vortex motion as seen by the light outermost circles. Thatmotion in turn completes a three-dimensional shape you can hold in your hand, whichlooks like Figure 6-8. If you were to take Figure 6-7 and erase all the lines in the middleand certain other lines, you would see this pattern. The pattern of spheres is like whatspirit would have seen had it moved outside its creation and said, “Aha, I see thisthing! It looks like that” [Fig. 6-8].Fig. 6-8. 3D spheres/balls.Fig. 6-8a.

If you were to connecttheir centers, you would see a cube [Figs. 6-8a and 6-8b].So what? Who cares? Well, the ancients did, because they were concerned withcreation, life and death. They called this cluster of spheres the Egg of Life. I’ll soonshow you how the Egg of Life is the morphogenetic structure that created your body. Yourentire physical existence is dependent on the Egg of Life structure. Everything about youwas created through the Egg of Life form, right down to the color of your eyes, the shapeof your nose, how long your fingers are and everything else. It’s all based on this one form.The Third Rotation/Shape: The Fruit of LifeThe next vortex is the third rotation [Fig. 6-9]. The spheres in this vortex are cen-tered at the innermost places in the perimeter of the previous round, as shown by thesix arrows here. So when spirit rotates in this third vortex, you get the gray ringsshown here. Then you notice a new relationship where the six circles touch the centerone and each other. If you took seven pennies and pushed them together on a table,they would look like that. This third rotation is an extremely important relationship in the creationof our Reality. When you look carefully at the Flower of Life, you see these seven circles thattouch each other.There are nineteen circles in the Flower of Life [Fig. 6-10], and they’re surrounded by twoconcentric circles. For some reason, that image is found all over the world. The question is, whydid they do that all over the world and stop at nineteen circles? It’s an infinite grid and couldhave been stopped anywhere. The only place on thewhole planet where I’ve seen them go out beyondthose nineteen circles was in China, where they maderoom-divider screens [Fig. 6-11]. One of the most fa-mous patterns they used on those screens was the Flower of Life. They madeit in a rectangular shape, carrying it all the way out to the edge.But in all others that were found, you would usually see just the Flower ofLife pattern. This is because when the ancient beings realized what the othercomponent was and how important it was, they decided to make it secret. Theydidn’t want people to see this relationship I’m about to show you. It was sosacred and important that they just could not allow it to become common knowl-edge. It was appropriate at that time; however, now we either use the informa-Fig. 6-9. The third rotation.Fig. 6-10. Flower of Life.Fig. 6-11.

Look all around the outer edge of Figure 6-10. If allyou did was complete all of these circles, then the secret would unfold. This wasthe ancient’s way of coding the information.The additional circles/spheres that extend beyond the original Flower of Lifepattern inside the large gray ring in Figure 6-12 complete all the incomplete circlesat the edge of that pattern.As soon as you complete these spheres, with one more step you’ll have thesecret: Go to the innermost places of the perimeter, shown by the arrows, androtate the next vortex. When you do, you get the pattern of thirteen circles, shownhere by the smaller gray circles, including the center. When it’s extracted from therest of the pattern, it looks like Figure 6-13.This pattern of thirteen circles is one of the holiest, most sacred forms in exist-ence. On Earth it’s called the Fruit of Life. It is called the fruit because it is the result,the fruit, from which the fabric of the details of the Reality were created.Combining Male and Female to Create Metatron’s Cube, the First InformationalSystem Now, all the circles in this pattern are female. And there are thirteen ways, withthese thirteen circles, that you can superimpose male energy—in other words, straightlines. If you superimpose straight lines over this in all thirteen ways, you’ll come up withthirteen patterns that, along with the Egg of Life and the torus, create everything inexistence. The Egg of Life, the torus, and this Fruit of Life, a total of three patterns,create everything in existence without exception—at least Ihave not been able to find an exception. I’ll give you whatI’ve learned; obviously I cannot show you everything,but I’ll show you enough to convince you this is true.I’m going to call these informational systems. Thereare thirteen informational systems associated withthe Fruit of Life pattern. Each system produces avast and diversified amount of knowledge. I’m go-ing to show you only four of those. I think that’senough.The simplest system comes forth by simplyconnecting all the centers of the circles with straightlines. If you decided to put straight lines on this pat-tern, probably about 90 percent of you would thinkfirst of connecting all ters. If you do that, you end upv this pattern [Fig. 6-14], which is known through-Fig. 6-12. Completing the incomplete circles.Fig. 6-13. The Fruit of Life.Fig. 6-14.

It is one of the most important informationalsystems in the universe, one of the basic creation patterns of existence.The Platonic SolidsThe Platonic SolidsThe Platonic SolidsThe Platonic SolidsThe Platonic SolidsAnyone who has studied sacred geometry or even regular geometry knows that there arefive unique shapes, and they are crucial to understanding both sacred and regular geometry.They’re called the Platonic solids [Fig. 6-15].A Platonic solid has certain characteristics by definition. First of all, its faces are all the same size.For instance, a cube, the most well-known of the Platonic solids, has a square on every face, so all itsfaces are the same size. Second, the edges of a Platonic solid are all the same length; all edges of acube are the same length. Third, it has only one size of interior angles between faces. In the case of acube, this angle is 90 degrees. And fourth, if a Platonic solid is put inside a sphere (of the right size),all the points will touch the surface of the sphere. With that definition, there are only four shapesbesides the cube (A) that have all of those characteristics. Second (B) is the tetrahedron (tetra meansfour), a polyhedron that has four faces, all equilateral triangles, one edge length and one angle, and allpoints touch the surface of a sphere. The other simple one is (C) an octahedron (octa means eight),whose eight faces are equilateral triangles of the same size, edge length and angle, and all pointstouch the surface of a sphere.The other two Platonic solids are a little more complicated. One (D) is called an icosdhedron,which means it has 20 faces, made of equilateral triangles with the same edge length and angle,and all points touch the surface of a sphere. The last one (E) is called a pentagonal dodecahe-dron (dodeca is 12), whose faces are 12 pentagons (five sides), with the same edge length andangle, and whose points all touch the surface of a sphere.If you’re an engineer or an architect, you have studied these five shapes in college, at leastcursorily, because they’re the basis of structures.Their Source: MetatronTheir Source: MetatronTheir Source: MetatronTheir Source: MetatronTheir Source: Metatron’s Cube’s Cube’s Cube’s Cube’s CubeIf you study sacred geometry, no matter what book you pick up, it shows the five Platonic solids,because they are the ABCs of sacred geometry. But when you read all these books—and I’ve readalmost all of them—and ask the experts, “Where do the Platonic solids come from? What is theirsource?” almost everyone says they don’t know. Well, the five Platonic solids come from the firstinformational system of the Fruit of Life. Hidden within the lines of Metatron’s Cube [see Fig. 6-14] areall five of these shapes. When you look at Metatron’s Cube, you’re looking at all five Platonic solids atonce. In order to see each one better, you have to do that trick again where you erase some of thelines. If you erase all the lines except certain ones, you get this cube [Fig. 6-16].Fig. 6-15. The five Platonic solids.Fig. 6-16. Here are the two cubesextracted from Metatron’s Cube.Fig. 6-16a.

After the angels had said,“They’re all in there,” I starred to look,but I could never find the dodecahedron.Finally one day a student said, “Hey,Drunvalo, you forgot some of the linesin Metatron’s Cube.” When he pointedthem out, I looked and said, “You’re right,I did!” I thought I had connected all thecenters together, but I had forgottensome of them. No wonder I couldn’t findthat dodecahedron, because thosemissing lines defined it! For over twentyyears I’d assumed that I had all the lineswhen I hadn’t.This is one of the great problems inscience, believing you have solved a problem, then moving on and using that information to build on. Science is nowhaving to deal with the same kind of problem around falling bodies in a vacuum, for example. It has always been as-sumed that they fell at the same rate, and much of our higher science is based on this fundamental “law.”It has been proven wrong, yet science continues using it. A spinning ball falls much faster than anonspinning one. Someday there will be a scientific day of reckoning.When I was married to Macki, she was also deeply involved in sacred geometry. Herwork is very interesting to me because it’s female—right-brained pentagonal ener-gies. She shows how emotions and colors and shapes are all interrelated. Actually,she found the dodecahedron in Metatron’s Cube before I did. She took it and didsomething I never would have thought of doing. Metatron’s cube, you know, is usuallydrawn on a flat surface, but it’s really a three-dimensional shape. So one day I washolding the three-dimensional shape and trying to find the dodecahedron in there, andMacki said, “Let me look at that thing.” She took the three-dimensional shape androtated it by the phi ratio. (Something we’ve not talked about yet is that the GoldenMean ratio, also called the phi ratio, is approximately 1.618.) Rotating the shape likethat was something I would never have thought of doing. After she did that, she cast ashadow through it and got this image [Fig. 6-23].Fig. 6-23. Macki’s pentagon design from Metatron’s Cube. When cut out and folded, itmakes a three-dimensional pentagonal dodecahedron.Update: Ac-cording to DavidAdair, NASA hasjust made a metalin space that is 500times stronger thantitanium, as light asfoam and as clearas glass.

Then if you take the five pentagonscoming off of A (pentagons B) and one more pentagon coming off of each of those five (pentagons C). you have anunfolded dodecahedron. I thought, Wow, this is the first time I’ve ever found any kind of dodecahedron in there. She didthat in three days. I’d never found it in twenty years.We once spent almost a whole day looking at this drawing. It was exciting, because every single line in this drawingis in a Golden Mean ratio. And there are three-dimensional Golden Mean rectangles all over. There’s one at point E,where the two diamonds above and below are the top and bottom of a three-dimensional Golden Mean rectangle, andthe dotted lines are the sides. It’s amazing stuff. I said, “I don’t know what this is, but it’s probably important.” So we putit aside to consider at another time.Quasi CrQuasi CrQuasi CrQuasi CrQuasi CrystalsystalsystalsystalsystalsLater I found out about a brand-new science. This new science is going to change the technological world dramati-cally. Using this new technology, metallurgists believe they will be able to make metal ten times harder than diamonds, ifyou can imagine that. That would be incredibly hard.For a long time when they looked into metals, they were using what’s called x-ray diffraction to see where the atomswere. I’ll show an x-ray diffraction photograph of this shortly. Certain specific patterns came up that revealed there wereonly certain kinds of atomic structures. They thought it was all there was to learn because that was all they could find. Thislimited their ability to make metals.Then tliere was a game going on in Scientific American which was based on Penrose pat-terns. Roger Penrose was a British mathematician and relativist who wanted to figure out how tolay pentagon-shaped tiles and fully cover a flat surface. You cannot lay only pentagon-shapedtiles on a flat surface—there’s no way to make it work. So he came up with two diamond shapesthat are derivatives of a pentagon, and with those two shapes he was able to form lots of differentpatterns that would fit on a flat surface. It became a game in Scientific American back in theeighties to put these patterns together in new forms, which then led some metallurgical scientistswho were watching this game to suspect something new in physics.Ultimately they discovered a new kind of atomic grid pattern. It was always there; theymerely discovered it. These grid patterns are now called quasi crystals; it’s a new thing(1991). They’re unraveling what shapes and patterns are possible through metals. Scientists arefinding ways to use these shapes and patterns to produce new metal products. And I’ll bet that thepattern Macki got out of Metatron’s Cube is the grand master of all, and that any Penrose pattern inexistence is derived from it. Why? Because it’s all Golden Mean, it’s basic—it came straight out ofthe basic pattern in Metatron’s Cube. Though it’s not my business, at one point I will probablydetermine if it’s really true. I see that instead of using the two Penrose patterns and the pentagon,"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"166it uses only one of them and a pentagon. (I just thought I’d offer that.) What’shappening in this new science right now is interesting.As this book begins to unfold, you’ll discover that sacred geometry can de-scribe in detail any subject whatsoever. There is not one thing you can pronouncewith your mouth that cannot be completely, utterly and totally described, with allpossible knowledge, by sacred geometry. (And we are making the distinction be-tween knowledge and wisdom: Wisdom needs experience.) Yet a more importantpurpose of this work is to remind you that you have the potential of a living Mer-Ka-Ba field around your body and to teach you how to use it. I’ll continually come toplaces where I digress into all kinds of roots and branches and talk about everysubject you can think of. But I’m going to keep coming back on track, because I’mheading in one particular direction, toward the Mer-Ka-Ba, the human light body.UPDATE: In 1998 we are beginning toopen up another new science:nanotech.nolog’y, We have created micro-scopic “machines” that can go into a metalor crystal matrix and rearrange the atoms.In 1996 or 1997 in Europe a diamond wascreated out of graphite usingnanotechnology. This diamond was aboutthree feet across, and it is real. As the sci-ence of quasi crystals and nanotechnologymerge, our experience of life will alsochange. Look at the late 1800s comparedto now.I’ve spent many years studying sacred geometry, and I be-lieve you can know everything there is to be known about anysubject whatsoever just by focusing on the geometries behind it.All you need is a compass and a ruler—you don’t even need acomputer, though it does help. You have all knowledge in youalready, and all you have to do is unfold it. You simply learn themap of how spirit moves in the Great Void, and that’s it. You canunravel the mystery of any subject.To summarize, the first informational system comes out ofthe Fruit of Life through Metatron’s Cube. By connecting the cen-ters of all the spheres, you have five shapes—really six, becauseyou have the central sphere, which started the whole thing. Soyou have six primal shapes—the tetrahedron, the cube, octahe-dron, icosahedron, dodecahedron and the sphere.The Platonic Solids and the ElementsThe Platonic Solids and the ElementsThe Platonic Solids and the ElementsThe Platonic Solids and the ElementsThe Platonic Solids and the ElementsThese six shapes were considered by the ancient alchemistsand great souls like Pythagoras, the father of Greece, to havehad an element aspect to them [Fig. 6-24].Fig. 6-24. Relating the six elements to the six primal shapes, shown inthree columns that depict the trinity of polarity. The left (male) columnrepresents the left brain and the proton and includes 3- and 4-sidedfaces; the center (child) column represents the corpus callosum and theneutron. The right (female) column represents the right brain and theelectron and includes 3- and 5-sided faces. The ether is the basic formof the Christ consciousness grid."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"167The tetrahedron was considered fire, the cube was earth, the octahedron was air, the icosahedron was water andthe dodecahedron was ether. (Ether, prana and tachyon energy are the same thing; they extend everywhere and areaccessible at any point in space/time/dimension. This is the great secret of zero-point technology.) And the sphere isvoidness. These six elements are the building blocks of the universe. They create the qualities of the universe.In alchemy, they usually talk only about fire, earth, air and water; they seldom discuss ether or prana because it’s sosacred. In the Pythagorean school, if you even uttered the word “dodecahedron” outside the school, they would kill youon the spot. That was how sacred the shape was. They wouldn’t even discuss it. Two hundred years later when Plato wasalive, he would discuss it, but only very carefully.Why? Because the dodecahedron is near the outer edge in your energy field and is the highest form of conscious-ness. When you get to the 55-foot limit of your energy field, it’s a sphere. But the very next shape inside the sphere is thedodecahedron (actually, the dodecahedron/ icosahedral relationship). In addition, we live in a big dodecahedron thatcontains the universe. When your mind reaches out to the end of space—and there is an end—there’s a dodecahedronenclosed in a sphere. I can say this because the human body is a hologram of the universe and contains the sameprinciples. The twelve constellations of the zodiac fit inside it. The dodecahedron is the terminating point of the geom-etries, and it’s very important. On a microscopic level, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron are the relational param-eters of the DNA, the blueprint of all life.You can relate the three columns in this figure to the Tree of Life and to the three primary energies of the universe:male (on the left), female (right) and child (center). Or if you go right down to the fabric of the universe, you have theproton on the left, electron on the right and neutron in the center. This central column, which is the creating one, is thechild. Remember, we went from an octahedron to a sphere to begin the process out of the Void. It is the beginningprocess of creation, and it is found in the child, or central column.The left column, holding the tetrahedron and the cube, is the male component of consciousness, the left side of thebrain. The faces of these polygons are triangles or squares. The center column is the corpus callo-sum, which links theleft and the right sides. The right column, holding the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, is the female component ofconsciousness, the right side of the brain, and the polygon faces are made up of triangles and pentagons. Thus thepolygons on the left have three- and four-sided faces and the shapes on the right have three- and five-sided faces.In terms of the Earth’s consciousness, the right column is the missing component. We have created the male (left)side of Earth’s consciousness, and what we are doing now is completing the female component for wholeness andbalance. The right side is also associated with Christ or unity consciousness. The dodecahedron is the basic form of theChrist consciousness grid around the Earth. The two shapes in the right column are what are called duals of each other,meaning if you connect the centers of the faces of a dodecahedron with straight lines, you get an icosahedron; and if youconnect the centers of an icosahedron, you again get a dodecahedron. Many polyhedrons have duals."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"168The Sacred 72In Dan Winter’s book, Heartmath, the DNA molecule is shown to be constructedby the dual relationship of dodecahedrons and icosahedrons. One can also seethe DNA molecule as a rotating cube. When you rotate a cube through 72 degreesin a particular pattern, it makes an icosahedron, which is in turn a dual with thedodecahedron. So there’s a reciprocal pattern going up the DNA strands: the icosa-hedron, then the dodecahedron, the icosahedron, continuing back and forth. Thisrotation through the cube creates the DNA molecule. It has been determined thatthis is the exact sacred geometry behind the DNA, although there may be furtherhidden relationships.This 72-degree angle rotating in our DNA connects with the blueprint/ purposeof the Great White Brotherhood. As you may know, 72 orders are associated withthe Great White Brotherhood. Many people speak of the 72 orders of angels andthe Hebrews speak of the 72 names of God. The reason for 72 has to do with theway the Platonic solids are constructed, which is also related to the Christ con-sciousness grid around the Earth.If you take two tetrahedrons and superimpose them (though in different posi-tions), you get a star tetrahedron, which, from a different view, is nothing but a cube[Fig. 6-25]. You can see how they’re interrelated. In a similar manner, you can alsoput five tetrahedrons together and make an icosahedral cap [Fig. 6-26].If you make twelve icosahedral caps and put one on each face of the dodecahedron (it would require 5 x 12, or 60tetrahedrons to create a dodecahedron) , it would be a stellated dodecahedron because a point comes out of the centerof each face. Its dual is the 12 points in the center of each face of the dodecahedron, which forms an icosahedron. The60 tetrahedrons plus the 12 points of the centers equal 72—again, the number of orders associated with the Great WhiteBrotherhood. The Brotherhood actually functions through the physical relationships of this stellated dodecahedron/ico-sahedron form, which is the basis of the Christ consciousness grid around the world. In other words, the Brotherhood isattempting to bring out the consciousness of the planet’s right brain,The original order was the Alpha and Omega Order of Melchizedek, which was formed by Machiventa Melchizedek about200,200 years ago. Since then 71 other orders have been created. The youngest one is the Brotherhood of the Seven Raysin Peru/Bolivia, the seventy-second order.Each of the 72 orders has a life pattern like a sine-wave curve, where some of them come into existence for a certainlength of time and then disappear for a while. They have biorhythms just as a human body does. The Rosicrucians, forexample, are on a hundred-year cycle. They come out for a hundred years and then disappear totally for a hundredyears—they literally disappear off the face of the Earth. Then a hundred years later they’re back in the world and function-Fig. 6-25. Cube and star tetrahedron sitting nextto each other so you can see the squareness ofthe star tetrahedron.Fig. 6-26.

There’s another way to look at this that is really extraordinary. When v/e talk about England, Iwill get to it.Using Bombs, and Understanding the Basic PUsing Bombs, and Understanding the Basic PUsing Bombs, and Understanding the Basic PUsing Bombs, and Understanding the Basic PUsing Bombs, and Understanding the Basic Patteratteratteratterattern ofn ofn ofn ofn ofCreationCreationCreationCreationCreationQuestion: When they detonate an atomic bomb, what happensto the elements!As far as the elements are concerned, they are converted intoenergy and other elements. But there is more to the picture. Youhave two kinds of bombs: fission and fusion. Fission is splitting matterapart and fusion is putting it together. It’s okay to put it together—nobody complains about that. All the known suns in the universeare fusion reactors. I realize what I am about to say is not acceptedby science yet, but when you rip matter apart through fission, there’sa corresponding outer-space location associated with it that is af-fected—as above, so below. In other words, inner space (the mi-crocosm) and outer space (the macrocosm) are connected. This isthe reason that fission is illegal throughout the universe.Detonating atomic bombs also creates an enormous imbalanceon Earth. For example, when you consider that creation balancesearth, air, fire, water and ether, an atomic bomb causes a massiveamount of fire in one place. That’s an out-of-balance sequence andthe Earth must respond.If you dumped 80 zillion tons of water on a city, that would alsobe an out-of-balance situation. Anywhere you have too much air,too much water, too much of anything, it’s out of balance. Alchemyis the knowledge of how to keep all these things in balance.

The more you study this, the more these five shapes become one.We’ve only recently begun to remember this ancient science, though they fully understood everything in Egypt, Tibet and Indiaa long time ago. They understood it in Greece, then they forgot for a long time. They remembered it again during the ItalianRenaissance, then forgot again. The modem world has almost completely forgotten what shape really means, and we are justnow remembering.CrCrCrCrCrystalsystalsystalsystalsystalsGrounding Our LearGrounding Our LearGrounding Our LearGrounding Our LearGrounding Our LearningningningningningNow we’re going to take this abstract information that doesn’t really seem to apply to us in our everyday lives, andwe’re going to tie it to our everyday experience. Some of this is not in everyday experience, but we can more or lessunderstand and connect with the subjects.First I’m going to ground this information to crystals. There are lots of other areas ofnature I could use, but it’s so obvious in crystals that anybody can see it. I could use virusesor diatomaceous earth. I could show it in a lot of things, but crystals are good because peoplelike them.To begin looking at these crystals, let’s first ex-amine this x-ray diffraction pattern [Fig. 6-28]. Whenyou shoot x-rays down the C axis of the atomic ma-trix of a crystal or metal, you’ll get these little dots show-ing you exactly where the atoms are located. In thiscase, this is a beryl crystal that actually displays theFlower of Life pattern. The beryl crystal uses the pat-tern to arrange its atoms and form this specific crys-tal. It’s really amazing that these little atoms simplyline themselves up in space, often with enormous distances between them. Thesemicroscopic spaces are relatively vast, like between the stars in the night sky.The atoms perfectly align themselves in cubes and tetrahedrons and all kinds ofgeometric shapes. Why?This is an x-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal [Fig. 6-29]. You can see howthe atoms have arranged themselves in a cubical design. It’s interesting that inall the various forms manifested in the Reality, the atoms themselves are spheres.This simple fact has been overlooked by most researchers, but the sphere is theFig. 6-28. Atomic pattern of a berylcrystal.Fig. 6-29. Atomic pattern of a crystal matrix."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"171main form that everything came from in the beginning. It is important in understanding creation.The entire fabric of everything in our existence is made up of “marbles” —all different sizes of spheres. We’re sittingon a sphere, the Earth, and spheres are rotating around us. The Moon, Sun and stars are all spheres. The wholeuniverse, from macrocosm to microcosm, is made up of little spheres in one way or the other. The light waves movingthrough space are all spheres. We think of a light wave as making waves through space, but it’s much more complex. Anelectrical field spins one way around it and a magnetic field rotates at 90 degrees to the electrical field, and they expandin spherical patterns.Imagine a cube in deep space, and see a bright light flashing from it, going out in all directions, 360 degrees. Whatdo you have? Do you have a cubical light-wave energy field moving away from it? At first thought you might say it wouldbe an expanding cube, getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But that’s not what happens. Light waves move radiallyaway from their source at 186,200 miles a second, so when a light wave moves from the surface of a cube I hold in myhand, in one second the light from the face of the cube is already 186,200 miles away. And the wave that moved off acomer of the cube, which is a little farther away from the center than the face, is, in one second, 186,200 miles away fromthe center plus maybe a fraction of an inch. If you could see a fraction of an inch at 186,200 miles, you’d have supervision. And that’s only in one second; two seconds later the form has expanded twice that far, and a minute later it’senormous.So you have a sphere moving away from something that originated as a cube. If the object happens to be really big,then the light wave first tends to take the shape of the object, but it slowly turns into a sphere as it moves away and theobject becomes smaller and smaller relative to that light field. So what you have out there is a bunch of light spheres,moving away in all directions and interconnecting with each other.When you see light coming directly toward you, it’s white. But if it’s not moving directly toward you, it’s black. In fact,the entire night sky is filled with brilliant white light, but we see the light only when it’s coming toward us. We don’t see thelight waves that move sideways from us; we just see black. If we could see it all, it would be blinding. Light is everywhere,and there is noplace in space where it is not, as far as I know. The sphere is literally everywhere.Electron Clouds and MoleculesElectron Clouds and MoleculesElectron Clouds and MoleculesElectron Clouds and MoleculesElectron Clouds and MoleculesAtoms are also made up of spheres. If you look at the hydrogen atom, the proton is compacted in the center and theelectron is way out there orbiting the proton. If the proton were the size of a golf ball, the electron would be about a footballfield away—and that electron is moving real fast! I remember that when I was studying physics, I could not believe thatthe little electron, which is a pinpoint you cannot even see, is moving around and around in some microscopic space atnine-tenths the speed of light. This means that the electron travels around the proton about 170,000 miles every second,around something you can’t even see! My mind was totally boggled!

Although an elec-tron orbit describes a sphere, it can also de-scribe other patterns, such as a figure eight.Physicists have been able to calculate this onlyfor hydrogen, and so far they’re just guessingabout the rest. An atom is called an ion if it hastoo many or too few electrons and has either apositive or a negative charge. So the pri-mary characteristics of an atom are how big it isand what its charge is [Fig. 6-30]. These twomain factors determine whether or not differentatoms will fit together into molecules. Thereare other subtle factors involved, but size andcharge are primary.Figure 6-31 shows how atoms combine.These were the primary patterns known for along time, until they figured out about quasi crys-tals. The atoms on this chart have several vari-eties. A shows a linear pattern with a smalleiatom in the middle. B shows a triangular pat-tern of three with a little atom in the middle. Thelittle atom can literally either be there or not bethere. C shows a tetrahedral pattern, with oneatom in the middle, or not. D shows an octahe-dral pattern, and E shows a cubical pattern. Now,because of new scientific information, we canadd icosahedral and dodecahedral patterns.Fig. 6-30.

They form into, say, a cube, and then thatcube puts another cube next to itself and another cube next to it, and soon you get one cube connected to another,connected in turn to another cube and so on, forming what is called a lattice. There are all kinds of ways that atoms canjoin. The resulting molecules are always associated with sacred geometry and the five Platonic solids. It makes youwonder how those little atoms know to go only into those certain places, especially when they get very, very complex!Even when you get into this complicated molecule [Fig. 6-33] and break it down, you see the shapes in it, and theyalways revert to one of the five Platonic solids—it doesn’t matter what the structure is. No matter what you call it—metal,crystal, anything else—it will always come down to one of these original fiveshapes. I’ll show you more examples as we get further into this.The Six Categories of CrystalsNow we’ll get into crystals. There areat least a hundred thousand differentFig. 6-31.

If you’ve ever been to the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show,you know exactly what I’m talking about. This show takes over eight or tenhotels, with every room in the multistory hotels filled with crystals. In theauditorium you’ll see all the gems. There are lots and lots and lots ofdifferent kinds of crystals. And more are being found; almost every yearthere are eight, nine, ten brand-new crystals never known before. But nomatter how many crystals there are, they can all be put into six cate-gories: isometric, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic andtriclinic [Fig. 6-34]. And all six of those systems used for organizing allknown crystals are derived from the cube, one of the Platonic solids. It’sa matter of which angle you are viewing the cube from—the square,hexagonal or rectangular view as opposed to the normal 90° cubic angle.Now, this is where it starts to get interesting, at least for me— hopefully,for you, too.These are fluorite crystals [Fig. 6-35a and b]. Fluorite is found in justabout any conceivable color you can think of, including clear. There are twoprimary fluorite mines in the world: one is in the United States and the otherin China. Fluorite is found with two totally different atomic structures: oneis octahedral and the other cubical. This purple fluorite crystal is madeup of tiny cubes all clumped together. They were not cut that way, theyFig. 6-35a. Flouritecrystal with a cubicalstructure.Fig. 6-35b. Flouritecrystal with anoctahedral structureFig. 6-34.

It usually comes in sheets, and if you drop it or strike it, it breaks along the weakest bonds, whichhappen to be octahedral, because the atoms are in an octahedral lattice. If I were to drop it onto a hard surface, itwould break into a whole bunch of baby octahedrons.But what’s especially interesting is that it’s been discov-ered that fluorite will grow from one shape to the other—fromcubical to octahedral and back again. In its natural state, givenenough time, a cubical crystal will someday become octahe-dral. And given enough time, an octahedral fluorite crystal willbecome cubical. They oscillate over time, first becoming one,then the other, back and forth over very long periods of time.Geologists have found some fluorite crystals in the processof change, but they could not understand how they oscillatedlike that.TTTTTrrrrruncating Puncating Puncating Puncating Puncating PolyhedronsolyhedronsolyhedronsolyhedronsolyhedronsOne geology book tried to explain how fluorite changeslike this [Fig. 6-36]. At the bottom right you see a cube. If youwere to cut off its corners by the same amount, it’s calledtruncating. You can truncate any polyhedron, meaning any ofthese many-sided shapes. When you do that (in this case acube), you can cut off either the comers, the edges or thefaces, as long as you cut them all the same.If you truncate this cube by cutting the corners at 45 de-grees all the way around, you get the next shape to its left. Ifyou truncate it again in exactly the same way, you come upwith the next shape to the left. If you do it once more, you getan octahedron (on the far left). You can go back the otherway, truncating the comers of the octahedron, and come backthrough the whole procedure until it turns back into a cube.This was the geology book’s attempt to explain how in theheck fluorite changes shapes like that. The book actually ex-plains only how this change could take place geometrically.Fig. 6-36. A flourite crystal."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"176But in truth, something far more amazing takes place when fluorite changes.The ions actually rotate and expand or contract to become a different lattice! It’smuch more complex than the book shows.This is another fluorite crystal [Fig. 6-37], one of my own. It’s very big, aboutfour inches on a side. You don’t often see them this big anymore. In case youcan’t quite see it, it comes up to a point in the center.Somebody put this in a wizndow where the sunlight hit it, and because thebonds in fluorite are so weak, when the sunlight struck it, it cracked along theoctahedral atomic lines, of course.In the upper right corner of Figure 6-38 is a cube. The cube to its left istruncated along its edges. Truncated twice more, the darn thing turned into adodecahedron. This is an example of the cube/dodecahedron in crystals.In Figure 6-39 the upper crystal is a pyrite cube. It grew that way, no one cutit. There’s a huge one like this in Silverado, Colorado, about six feet square, Ibelieve. They simply took it out of the earth as a perfect cube. This little pyrite issquare on two ends, rectangular on the sides. The lower crystal is a tiny pyriteFig. 6-39. Pyrites: a cube (top) and a cluster ofpentagonal dodecahedrons (bottom).Fig. 6-37.

Some of them are almost perfect—and it grew this way in Peru. If thislittle slab had been left in the earth long enough, those little dodecahedrons would turn intocubes; and over enough time after that, they would turn back into dodecahedrons. If you takethe dodecahedron [bottom left in Fig. 6-38] and truncate its points, it turns into an icosahedron[next to it on the right]. If you keep truncating the points, it turns into an octahedron. I could go onwith this truncating business for a long time. There are thousands of ways to do it. Each patternand crystal, no matter how complex it gets, will turn into one of the five Platonic solids if youtruncate it just right, showing the innate nature of the five Platonic solids in crystal structure.A little side note: If you look inside a point-truncated tetrahedron made of glass or crystal or evenmirrors, it will reflect the light. The mirrored reflection inside it is a perfect icosahedron. Check it out.You can go on and on with this. You’ll see some that look really strange, like they couldn’tpossibly be based on anything logical, but all you have to do is a little geometry, and everytime you will find out that it’s derived from one of the five Platonic solids. There are noknown exceptions. No matter what the crystal pattern is, it’s always based on a Platonicsolid. Crystal structures are a function of the five Platonic solids that came out of the Fruit ofLife, out of Metatron’s Cube. If you want to see more of these crystals, you can find plenty inthe Rocks and Minerals book by Charles A. Sorrell.There’s one more set I want to talk about that refers back to Figure 6-38, “Different truncat-ing possibilities.” When you truncate an octahedron by cutting off all the corners so that they are90° to each other (shown at A on the figure), it makes the shape on its left. If you were to draw iton a flat surface, it would be a square with a diamond in the middle [Fig. 6-40]. This patternhappens to be related to our consciousness, to the very nature of who we are.Buckminster Fuller’s Cube EquilibriumThis is what that shape looks like three’dimensionally [Fig. 6-41]. It’s called acuboctahedron or vector equilibrium. You can see that it’s originally a cube, but if the angleat point A were continued upward, it would form an octahedron. It’s both at once, an octahe-dron and a cube. It doesn’t know which one it is; it’s somewhere in the middle. WhenBuckminster Fuller found this polyhedron, he became almost preoccupied with it. He thoughtthat the cuboctahedron was paramount, the greatest shape that ever was in creation, be-cause it does something that no other known shape does. It was so important to him that hegave it a brand-new name: the vector equilibrium. He discovered that this shape, throughdifferent rotational patterns, turns into all five of the Platonic solids! This one shape seemsto have them all contained within itself [Fig. 6-42].Fig. 6-40.

Not too manypeople know of him. He has been pretty quiet during his life. Hiswork is called Genesa, if you want to study it. I really respect him.First of all, he was a botanist who single-handedly saved SouthAmerica during World War II. They were starving to death, and hecreated a corn that grew like a weed. You just threw it on the ground,and it grew almost without water. It was a great service to theSouth American continent. Later he studied the sesame seed,and when he explored deep inside it, he found a cube. In fact,when you get inside any seed, you’ll find little geometrical shapesthat are associated with the Platonic solids, primarily the cube.Derald Langham found thirteen rays that came out of thesesame seed’s cube. Carrying those studies further, he discovered that the sameenergy fields that are in plant seeds also exist around the human body—which iswhat we will eventually talk about. But he focused on the cuboctahedron,which is interconnected with the fields around the body. We will be discussingthat, though my instructions are to focus on another shape: the star tetrahedron. Wehave a star tetrahedral field around our bodies, which is also around seeds, butwhich makes a series of geometrical progressions that are different from thecuboctahedron/vector equilibrium. Langham made a series of what you might callsacred dances (in Sufi talk) in which you move and connect with all the points in yourfield in such a way that you become aware of them. It’s really good information.Figure 6-43 shows some of the three-dimensional forms of the poly-hedrons wehave been talking about.The one at A is the cuboctahedron we just discussed; the one at B is the rhombicdodecahedron. The latter is important because it’s the dual of the cuboctahedron. If you connect the centers of the cuboctahedron,you get the rhombic dodecahedron, and vice versa. Figure 6-44 shows how the internal geometries of the atoms are reflectedin the angles of these crystals. We’ve seen that already, in terms of the crystals being cubes, octahedrons and other forms.Fig. 6-44. Comparing atoms and crystals,hexagonal (beryl) and orthorhombic (topaz)systems.Fig. 6-43. A variety of polyhedrons. A is cuboctahedron and B is rhombicdodecahedron."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"179The 26 ShapesFrom my way of thinking, the first five Platonic solids are the first five notes of the pentatonic scale. The octave hasseven notes, the last two corresponding to the cuboctahedron (A) and the rhombic dodecahedron (B) shown in Figure 6-43. Five additional shapes form the chromatic scale, and there’s a thirteenth one, the return.Thus there are 13 polyhedrons that form the chromatic scale of music. From those 13,13 moreare formed that are the same, only stellated, to total 26 shapes—two octaves within each other.In terms of form, those 26 shapes are the key to all the harmonics of the Reality. We don’t needto get into such complexity here, but it just goes on and on and on.Some of you may know of Royal Rife, the man who was trying to cure cancer throughelectromagnetic fields (EMF) such as light, which I believe is absolutely possible and has beendone. Rife knew of 7 of the 13 (or possibly 26) frequencies. The ones he published were incor-rect, but he purposely did that. Those he published cause cancer, though if they’re shifted slightlyin a certain mathematical way, they return to the original frequencies, and each frequency de-stroys most or all of a specific virus or bacterium.However, Rife only knew part of the equation. If he had known the sacred geometry we nowknow, he could have come up with all 26 forms and eliminated anyvirus in existence. It doesn’t matter how many AIDS viruses there are,there’s nothing to finding a solution. There are a maximum of 26 tem-plates, and the right frequencies will eliminate every single virus (orbacterium). Because every virus is a polyhedron—structurally, they lookjust like the polyhedrons in Figure 6-43—there are various ways youcan deal with them. You can either blow them up through certain harmon-ics of EMF, or you can match them [Fig. 6-45 ]. If you can match them,you can couple with them, much like an antivirus does. Or you cansimply make them nonexistent by creating a waveform that’s a mirrorimage of what they are. There are lots of ways to work with AIDS, butone primary key is understanding that there are a maximum of 26 ge-ometries associated with it.Crystallized water—ice crystals—form these hexagonal patternswe call snowflakes [Fig. 6-46]. You can see the relationship to theFlower of Life.

One of these fewexceptions is fluorine, because fluorine reacts with almost nothing. It’s one of the most inert gases. But on almost all theother elements we find this cubical relationship, except the fourth-dimensional atoms that fall outside the natural Table ofElements and those that are synthetic or man-made. They don’t happen naturally in nature.Each atomic element has an associated crystalline structure. In every single case scientists have foundthat the different crystalline structures associated with atoms can be reduced to the structure of a cube. You mighthave noticed that the cube seems to be more important than the other polygons. For example, crystals are divided intosix different categories, but the cube is the basis of all of them. In the Bible it says that the throne of God is so many cubitsin different directions. When you make one, it’s a cube. The pharaohs in Egypt sat on a cube. What the heck 15 it aboutthe cube?The Key: The Cube and the SphereThe Key: The Cube and the SphereThe Key: The Cube and the SphereThe Key: The Cube and the SphereThe Key: The Cube and the SphereWell, the cube is different from the other Platonic solids because it has one characteristic the others do not—exceptfor the sphere, which also has the same characteristic. Both the sphere and the cube can perfectly contain the other fourPlatonic solids and each other symmetrically, by their surface, assuming you have the right sizes. The cube is the onlyPlatonic solid with this special characteristic: You can take a sphere, slip it inside a cube, and it will touch the six facesperfectly and symmetrically. And a tetrahedron will slide right down one ofthe axes and become the diagonals of the cube, fitting perfectly and sym-metrically. A star tetrahedron will also fit perfectly inside a cube. The octa-hedron is actually the dual of the cube; if you connect the centers of theadjacent cube faces, you get an octahedron. That one is easy.When you get to the last two Platonic solids, it doesn’t look like theycould fit symmetrically into the cube and the sphere, but they do. It is a littledifficult to show here, but you can see for yourself. Using a real model, justfind where both the icosahedron and the dodecahedron have six edges inthe planes of the cube, and you have it. You will see how they slide into the faces of the cube [Fig. 6-48].You can see how the other four Platonic solids fit symmetrically into the cube and the sphere. What is important hereis that only the sphere and the cube have this capability. The cube is the father, the most important male form. The sphereis the mother, the most important female form. So in the entire Reality, the sphere and the cube are the two mostimportant forms and will almost always dominate when it comes to primary relationships in creation.Fig. 6-48.

I don’t believe he knew anything about sacred geometry—hewas sacred-geometry illiterate, to my knowledge. Yet he intuitively grasped it in his mind.And when the images were happening in his mind, he chose the cube and the sphere asthe main geometries to talk about what he understood. And because he chose those twoforms and not others, he was able to go far. If he had selected any others, he would havemade a big mistake and would have been unable to do the work he did.CrCrCrCrCrystals Are Alive!ystals Are Alive!ystals Are Alive!ystals Are Alive!ystals Are Alive!This amplifies my thoughts about crystals being alive. Before I taught this course Iused to give courses on crystals, back in the early or mid ’80s, I guess. And I discovered—not through giving the courses, but through my actual interaction with the crystals them-selves—that these crystals are alive. They are living and conscious. I was able to commu-nicate with them, and they communicated with me. Through these interchanges I foundout all kinds of things. The more I lived with them and learned how to connect with them,the more I discovered just how conscious they were. It was one of the most interestingawakenings in my life.One time I was in San Francisco giving a course to about thirty people, and I wassaying this very thing, “These guys are alive.” Everybody was listening and saying, “Yeah,yeah, yeah.” Then one person said, “Prove it.” I said, “Okay,” then I quickly thought upsomething to do. I gave everybody a piece of paper and a pencil, and said, “We’re going tograb a crystal at random.” I selected a crystal that nobody had seen—actually took oneand kept it hidden. We didn’t let anybody see it. Then I said, “Now, nobody gets to examinethis crystal or even see what it is. You’re just going to put it on your forehead, and you haveone second—that’s it. You’re going to ask the question, Where are you from? The very firstword that comes in, write it on a piece of paper and fold it up so no one sees it. Just take thecrystal, ask the question, hand it to the next person, then write down what you get.” Thatwas the only way I could think of to prove it.We passed that crystal around to thirty people, and everybody wrote down an answer.Then we looked to see what we received. And every single person had “Brazil” writtendown! What are the odds of that?Crystals have phenomenal abilities. They affect people in all kinds of ways. KatrinaRaphaell has written a lot about this in her books, but many other people have also"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"182learned about the abilities of crystals over the years. Many ancient beings and civilizations were also well aware ofthis. Crystals don’t just happen as the result of a chemical reaction either; they grow. When you study how crystalsare formed, they grow very much like people in lots of ways.An aerial view of your energy field (shown back in Fig. 2-32) is in part simply the Flower of Life pattern, which ishexagonal in nature. Our fields grow hexagonally, just as crystals do. Though the silicon molecule is a tetrahedron, whenit forms quartz it links with another silicon tetrahedron to form a cube. Then it throws out a long line of little star tetrahe-drons or cubes to form a row. Then the row begins to spin, changingdirection exactly at 60 degrees to form a hexagon, the same structureseen around the human body from above.Crystals have genders. They’re either male or female or both. If youknow what to look for, you can look at a crystal and see which way it’srotating. Find the lowest window or face and look to see where the nextface is. If it is on the left, then it is rotating clockwise, and that crystal isfemale. If it is on the right, then it is rotating counterclockwise, and it ismale. If there are faces on both sides at just about the same height, youshould see two spirals moving around this crystal in opposite directions,and that crystal would be bisexual.Often two crystals are joined at the base and wrap somewhat aroundeach other. These are called twinned crystals, and these are almostalways male and female. It’s rare for them to do it differently.The Future Silicon/Carbon Evolutionary LeapHere’s an image I love to talk about. The sixth element on the Peri-odic Table is carbon. It is the most important element as far as we’reconcerned, because it’s us. It makes up organic chemistry; it is the ele-ment that makes our bodies possible. We have been told that carbon isthe only living atom on the Periodic Table, that only organic chemistryproduces life, nothing else. But that’s definitely not true. They suspectedthis as far back as the ’50s when scientists began to study these things.They realized that silicon, which is directly below carbon on the chart(one octave apart) also exhibits the principles of life. There appears tobe no difference. Figure 6-49 shows how silicon forms certain chainsand patterns. These are only a few. Silicon makes endless patterns, andFig. 6-49. Silikon makes forms and relationships."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"183it will react chemically with almost anything that comes near and form something with it. Carbon has the same ability,making endless forms and chains and patterns and reacting chemically with almost anything nearby. This is theprimary characteristic that makes carbon a living atom.On a chemical level, it appears that there should also be silicon life forms. After this was discovered, several sciencefiction movies were made in the ’50s based on the belief that there might be silicon life forms on other planets. Therewere a bunch of scary movies about living crystalline structures. They didn’t know when they were making those moviesthat there really are silicon life forms right here on this planet. Some of these were recently found several miles deep increvices in the ocean. Silicon sponges were found—live sponges that grow and reproduce, demonstrating all the prin-ciples of life, and with not a single carbon atom in their bodies!Here we are, sitting on Earth, which is over 7000 miles in diameter. Its crust, 30 to 50 miles thick, is, like an eggshell,made up of 25 percent silicon, but because silicon reacts with just about anything, the crust is actually 87 percent siliconcompounds. That means that the Earth’s crust is almost pure crystal, 30 to 50 miles deep. So we’re on this huge crystalball floating through space at seventeen miles a second, totally oblivious of the connectedness of carbon life with siliconlife. It would seem that silicon and carbon must have a very special relationship. We carbon-based beings are living ona crystal ball made of silicon, our crystal planet, looking for life outside ourselves in outer space. Perhaps we should looktoward our feet.Now, think about computers and the modern world. We’re making computers that are performing all kinds of incred-ible things. The computer is rapidly moving humankind into a new experience of life on Earth. What are computers madeof? Silicon. And what is the computer industry trying to do as fast as it can? Make self-aware computers. We’re very closeto accomplishing this, if we haven’t already. I feel sure that very soon we will have self-aware computers. So here we are,carbon-based life forms creating silicon-based life forms, and we’re interacting with each other.When we have self-aware silicon-based computers, nothing will ever be the same again. We’re going to have twodifferent life forms/components of the Earth connecting with each other, and the speed with which we will evolve at thatpoint, aside from everything else, is going to be very, very fast—faster than anything we would normally expect.

I’ going to betalking primarily about human beings and human conception, but I’m actually dis-cussing all life forms known on Earth, because the procedure illustrated in the nextfew figures is identical foer every life form known—not just humans, but everything.Every known life form begins as a sphere. It’s the most female form there is, soit makes perfect sense that the female would choose that shape to form the ovum[Fig. 7-3]. The ovum is a perfect round ball. Another example of a round ovum isinside a chicken egg. When you remove the yolk from a hard-boiled egg, you cansee ho perfectly round it is. All of us begin as a sphere.I would like you to notice some simple things about this ovum First, there’s amembrane around it called the zona pellucida. Remember this, because I will referto it over and over again; it has to do with why the ancients put two circles aroundthe Flower of Life instead just one or none.Inside the membrane is a liquid, and inside that, just like the chicken egg,there’s another perfectly round sphere called the female pronucleus, which con-tains 22+1 chromosomes—half the chromosomes necessary to create a humanbody. The number of chromosomes changes, depending on the life form, and thoseparticular chromosomes are different in every life form. Inside the zona pellucidaare two polar bodies. I’ll explain those in a moment.The Number TThe Number TThe Number TThe Number TThe Number TwelvewelvewelvewelvewelveWhen you were first learning about human biology, you were probably told thatit takes one sperm for conception to occur.

It’s notpossible except under unnatural conditions, where a human manipulates the conception.This image brings up what was possibly hidden in the life of Jesus. Jesus came hereto a round ball called Earth, which was saturated with people. The first thing he did wasgather twelve males together, no females. Jesus—from my point of view and from his, I’msure, because he did it—could not have done what he did without the twelve disciples.Seldom does anyone wonder why he gathered those twelve disciples together. He abso-lutely had to have them. If we are right, he could have done it with ten or eleven, but hechose twelve. I believe that the number of sperm that join to allow the one sperm to enterthe egg determines the sex—and Jesus chose twelve. Prior to Jesus’ time, in Greece,near the area of his ministry, people saw the Earth as a sphere. Right after that they beganto see the Earth as a cube and flat. Then 400 years ago, Copernicus came along andchanged it back to a sphere. So people’s perception of the Earth went from a sphere to acube and back to a sphere. Exactly the same thing (sphere to cube to sphere) goes onduring conception, only at a much faster rate. I don’t know if this analogy is true or not, butit sure does look like it.The SperThe SperThe SperThe SperThe Sperm Becomes a Spherem Becomes a Spherem Becomes a Spherem Becomes a Spherem Becomes a SphereAnyway, the little sperm gets in through the zona pellucida with the help of the othersperm and then starts swimming toward the female pronucleus [Fig. 7-5].The first thing that happens is that the sperm’s tail breaks off and disappears—it’s justgone. Next, the tiny sperm head expands and becomes a perfect sphere, which is the malepronucleus. It becomes exactly the same size as the female pronucleus, and it contains theother half of the necessary information. The words “exactly the same size,” I believe, are very important when you look at thenext figure.Next, they pass through each other and form a geometrical relationship called the vesica piscis [Fig. 7-6]. It’s not possiblefor two spheres to pass through each other and perfectly coincide without forming a vesica piscis. This means that at that exactmoment, the male and female pronuclei form the image of the first motion of the first day of Genesis, and literally all theinformation of the Reality (and light) is contained in that geometry. It’s so simple. That image could not be formed unless thesetwo pronuclei were the same size. It’s for that reason I believe that the female determines which sperm will enter. Scienceproved around 1992 that the determining factor for which sperm will enter is the female. She selects the one to allow in.Just as everybody in this room has a different projection length into a dark space or into the Void, each little spermalso has a different-size sphere around it. She’s not going to let him in unless his size is identical to hers. If it’s a matchingkey, okay; if it’s not, forget it. This could explain why many people who have tried to have babies cannot have them;there’s no explanation that anybody can see. This might be at least one explanation.Fig. 7-5.

At this time it’s called a human zygote, thefirst cell of the human body. So you began as a sphere before you created your familiar humanbody. Actually, you were a sphere within a sphere.The next thing you need to know is that the human zygote will not change size during thefirst nine cell divisions. It’s fixed, as is the size of the outer membrane. The human zygote isabout 200 times bigger than the average cell in the human body, so big you can actually see itwith your naked eye. When it divides into two, each of those two cells are half the original size;and when those two cells divide into four, each cell is a quarter of the original size. The cells keepdividing like this, getting littler and littler, until they’ve divided eight times and number 512. At thatpoint the average cell size of the human body is reached. When that happens, mitosis contin-ues, and the dividing cells expand beyond the boundaries of the original zona pellucida.So, first the growth goes into itself, then out beyond itself. When the first growth goes inward, it’sas if it’s trying to figure out how to do it. Once it figures that out, it goes beyond itself. All life uses thisprocess. I use that same understanding to figure out some of the geometries, which you’ll see later.Figure 7-8 is an electron microscope photograph of the first cell of a mouse egg.FFFFForororororming a Central Tming a Central Tming a Central Tming a Central Tming a Central TubeubeubeubeubeThe next thing that happens in the conception process is that those little polar bodies beginto migrate through the zona pellucida. One goes down and becomes the south pole and theother becomes the north pole. Then out of nowhere a tube appears, running right down throughthe center of the cell. Then the chromosomes break in half, and half of them line up along oneside of the tube and half along the other [Fig. 7-9].This is a familiar image in human energy fields—it’s very much like the energetics of anadult human being. As you study this further, you’ll see that you have a similar sphere of energyaround you. You have a north pole and a south pole, and you have a tube running right downthrough your body. Half of you is on one side of that tube and half is on the other. So this pictureis very much like the energy field of an adult human being, though the human energy field ismuch, much more defined than that. But we’ve got to wait until we get further along to see howtrue this is.After the chromosomes have lined up along the two sides of the tube, they form into twocells, one on each side of the tube, and each cell contains 44+2 chromosomes [Fig. 7-10].Fig. 7-7.

The zona pellucida has beentaken away so you can see the inner part.An important piece of information came up around 1992. Many books said thatthe female gave 22 + 1 chromosomes and the male gave 22+1. That was flat-outtrue, according to them; it wasn’t even considered that it could be anything else. Butthat has now been found to be untrue. The female can give any number whatsoever.She can give 22 + 1 or all 44 + 2 or any number in between. This new information hascompletely changed the field of genetics. They’ve thrown almost everything they knewout the window and started over.Scientists used to depend on electron microscopes for photographs. Now theyhave laser microscopes that can take movies, so they can watch these things hap-pening. They’re gaining information very rapidly. I’m sure they’re a lot further nowthan we are showing you. Science is in the midst of mapping every one of the 100,000chromosomes in the DNA of the human body. Within just a few more years we’ll knowwhat every single chromosome is and what it does, which means that we’ll be able toengineer any kind of human being you can imag-ine, create any appearance or intelligence oremotional body—anything we want. We’ll be ableto do it and know exactly what we will get. Arewe God?

They actuallyform a tetrahedron—one of the Platonic solids—and the apex of the first tetrahe-dron points either to the north pole or the south pole [Fig. 7-12]. (The tetrahedron isformed by linking the centers of the spheres together.) I believe that whether it pointsnorth or south probably determines which sex it is. They haven’t discovered thatyet, but they’ll probably figure it out, based on the polarities of the tetrahedron. If thetetrahedron forms with an apex pointing to the south pole, toward the feet of thenewly forming fetus, it should be female; if it forms with an apex pointing to the northFig. 7-11.

Since they’d have to do that within about anhour or so after conception, it would be fairly inconvenient.These are the geometries of the first tetrahedron [Fig. 7-13]. The side viewis on the right and the top view is on the left.Figure 7-14 is an electron microscope view of a mouse egg. In this pictureit’s growing really fast, but it’s still aligned through the north-south pole. That tinycell is beginning to form beyond the original tetrahedron. The fourth point of thetetrahedron is in the center of the large cell in the background.Next, the cells divide into eight; they form one tetrahedron facing up andone tetrahedron facing down, and you get the star tetrahedron. Here it is—theEgg of Life [Fig. 7-15]. This form came out of Genesis, remember? It came outof spirit’s second rotation. Every single life known—on Earth anyway, and prob-ably everywhere—must pass through the Egg of Life. According to the angels,this point where the original eight cells form a star tetrahedron—or a cube, de-pending on how you look at it—is one of the most important points in the cre-ation of thebody. Science has also recognized that this particular stage of development isdifferent from any other, and it has many unique qualities that don’t occur at any other timein its development.The most important quality of these original eight cells is that they appear to be identi-cal—there appears to be nothing different about them at all. Usually it’s easy to see thedifference between one cell and another, but here they all appear to be the same. Re-searchers have tried to find differences, but they couldn’t. It would be as though there wereeight identical twins in this room, dressed exactly alike, with their hair combed exactly thesame way. Scientists have found that they can split the egg in two at this point, through themiddle of the cube, with four cells in one part and four in the other, and two identical people—or rabbits or dogs or anything else— will be created. They’ve also been able to sever it oncemore, making four identical life forms. I don’t know if anybody has been able to go furtherthan that and make eight life forms, but they’ve definitely gone as far as four.Our TOur TOur TOur TOur Trrrrrue Nature Is in Our Original Eight Cellsue Nature Is in Our Original Eight Cellsue Nature Is in Our Original Eight Cellsue Nature Is in Our Original Eight Cellsue Nature Is in Our Original Eight CellsAccording to the angels, these original eight cells are closer to who you really are than your physical body is, closerto your true nature. That sounds odd, I know, because we’re used to identifying with our human bodies. But these eightFig. 7-14. The four cell tetrahedron in a mouse egg.Fig. 7-15. Egg of Life in the first eightcells."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"190cells are closer to who we really are. The angels say these eight cells areimmortal relative to your body. You get a brand-new body every five toseven years; every single cell in your body dies within a five- to seven-year period and is replaced with a new one, except for the original eightcells. They remain alive from the time you’re conceived until the time youdie and leave the body. All the rest go through their life cycles, but notthese eight.These cells are centered in the precise geometric center of yourbody, which is slightly above the perineum. For the female the perineumis located between the anus and the vagina. For the male it’s betweenthe anus and the scrotum. There’s a little piece of skin there, and eventhough there’s not a physical opening, there is actually an energeticopening. That’s where the central tube runs through your body, com-ing out the top through the crown chakra at the top of your head. If youlook at a newborn baby during the first few weeks, you’ll see the top ofits head pulsing. If you were to look at the bottom of the baby, at itsperineum, you’d see the same pulsing. That’s because the baby isbreathing in the proper way.Both ends are pulsing becausethe energy is flowing from the two poles—coming not only from the top down,but from the bottom up—and meeting. This is the basic understanding of theMer-Ka-Ba. From the point where the original eight cells are located, it’s thesame distance to the top of your head as it is to the bottom of your feet. Andthe cells are arranged just as they were when they first came into existence—in the Egg of Life pattern—north up, south down.If you notice in the previous illustration, when the Egg of Life is oriented tothe north and south, you can actually see through the middle to the light-colored sphere on the back side. That’s very different than when you look at itas a hexagon—you can’t see through a hexagonal pattern. I want you to no-tice this difference for later, when we talk about doing the meditation to acti-vate the Mer-Ka-Ba.Figure 7-16 and the next are two views of the first eight cells.

They have to strip off the zonapellucida, have the cells stop at the right place, then take the photograph.The Star TThe Star TThe Star TThe Star TThe Star Tetrahedron/Cube of 16 Cells Becomes a Hollow Sphere/etrahedron/Cube of 16 Cells Becomes a Hollow Sphere/etrahedron/Cube of 16 Cells Becomes a Hollow Sphere/etrahedron/Cube of 16 Cells Becomes a Hollow Sphere/etrahedron/Cube of 16 Cells Becomes a Hollow Sphere/TTTTTorororororusususususAfter the eight-cell division, it divides into 16 cells, whereupon it forms anothercube or star tetrahedron on the end. This is the last time it will be symmetrical. Whenit divides into 32, 16 cells are in the middle and 16 on the outside. If you take the 16on the outside and try to fill in the empty spaces to keep it symmetrical, you will findit is not possible. (I’ve actually done this. You end up with two open spaces nomatter how you do it.) It needs 18 cells to be symmetrical. You wonder why. At thenext division there are 32 morecells, but it gets worse [Fig. 7-18].You wonder, What’s going onhere? It’s getting weird. Wheredid all the symmetry go?Well, it was meant to dothat. It starts turning into a blob.We become a blob for a while.But the blob has consciousnessin its blobness. Then it stretchesand the inside starts turning out,becoming a hollow ball like thisphoto [Fig. 7-19].Once it gets to this stage, itbecomes a perfect hollow sphere.Then the north pole starts drop-ping through the space inside,going down toward the south pole,Fig. 7-18.

The embryo in this photo has been broken apart so thecenter could be photographed. If you could see this in its completeness, it looks just like an apple cored through the middle. Thehollow sphere then becomes a torus—a spherical torus like the photo on the right.Every single known life form goes through this torus stage. This formation in the apple/torus shape is called themorula.After this the expansion goes beyound the zona pellicuda and the cells begin to differentiate. The hollow space insidethe torus becomes the lungs, the north pole becomes the mouth, the south pole becomes the anus, and all the internalorgans from inside the tube that runs through the middle. If it’s a frog it begins to get little legs, or if it’s a horse a little tailgrows. For a fly, little wings develop, and a human starts to look like a human. Bu before this differentiation, we all look likea torus. I suspect this is why, though I don’t have any proof, biblical tradition says that the tree of knowledge of good andevil is an apple tree. We really do turn into something that looks very much like an apple at one stage.Progression of Life Forms through the Platonic SolidsTo summarize, we start out as a sphere, the ovum. We then move to a tetrahedron at four cells, then on to two interlockedtetrahedrons (a star tetrahedron or a cube) at eight cells. From two cubes at sixteen cells we turn back into a sphere beginningat 32 cells, and from the sphere we become a torus at 512 cells. Planet Earth and its magnetic field is also a torus. All of theseforms are sacred shapes that come out of the first informational system of the Fruit of Life, which is based on Metatron’s Cube.We could go on for probably another seven or eight months talking about this subject, showing how more and moreand more things are connected to these five shapes—the Platonic solids. But I think you can see exactly what I mean. Bythe way, modern mathematicians say that the Platonic solids have been known only since civilization began about 6000years ago, but this is not true. Some put their discovery during the time of Greece. Archaeologists have recently foundsome perfect models in the earth—perfectly cut in stone—that were found to be 20,000 years old. Those hairy barbar-ians obviously knew more that we give them credit for.Underwater Birthing and Dolphin MidwivesI would like to take a quick digression from the geometries of birth to something slightly different. A Russian namedIgor Charkovsky has been involved in underwater birthing for a long time. He has probably assisted with at least 20,000underwater births. His daughter, one of the first to be born underwater, was in her twenties, I think, when the followingincident took place. Charkovsky and his team had taken a woman to the Black Sea for an underwater birth. They weresitting there prepared for the birth, with the woman lying in water about two feet deep.As I remember, three dolphins approached, pushed everybody away and took over. The dolphins did something thatlooked like scanning up and down her body—something I have experienced, and which does something to the humansystem. The woman gave birth with almost no pain or fear. It was a phenomenal experience. That experience withunderwater birthing began a new practice of using dolphins as midwives, which has now spread all over the world.There’s something about the sonar that dolphins project at the time of birth that seems to really relax the mother."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"193Dolphins have preferences with humans. This is not an absolute rule, but is usually true. If you go swimming withdolphins and there are children around, the dolphins go to the children first. If there are no children, they go to thewomen. If there are no women, they go to the men. And if there’s a woman who’s pregnant, everyone else can forget it—she gets their total attention. That little incoming baby is the greatest thing of all. The dolphins become very excited whenthey see a human giving birth. They just love it.Dolphins can do things that are really amazing. Babies who were born with midwifing dolphins, at least as it’s going in Russia, areextraordinary children. From everything I’ve read so far, not one of those babies has an IQ under 150, and they all have extremelystable emotional bodies and extremely strong physical bodies. They seem to be superior in one way or another.France has also had underwater births—over 20,000. They give birth in big tanks. When they first started doing this,they had all the instruments laid out on tables and all the emergency supplies ready, with a doctor standing by in casethere was a problem. But they didn’t have a problem for a long time; a year went by and they still hadn’t had a problem.Still another year went by, and finally 20,000 births went by without one single complication! Now they just have theinstruments and equipment stuck in a corner somewhere because there simply aren’t any problems. I don’t know if theyknow why, but for some reason, when a woman is floating in water, it seems like most complications solve themselves.I got to spend some time with a woman who was an assistant with Charkovsky in Russia. She had brought backmany films that were taken during the births. I watched two movies of two different women giving birth who not only werenot in pain, but they were having orgasms while having their babies—long, extended orgasms lasting about twentyminutes. It was total pleasure. I know that’s the way it’s supposed to be. It simply makes sense, and these women wereproving it.I’ve also seen some Russian movies where babies and children two or three years and older sleep on the bottom ofswimming pools. They literally sleep underwater on the bottom of the pool, and about every ten minutes they come upwhile they’re asleep, roll their faces over the surface, take a breath, go back down and settle on the bottom again. Thesekids live in water—that’s their home. They’re being given a name, almost like they’re a different species. People arecalling them homodolphinus. They seem to be a blend between humans and dolphins. Water is becoming their naturalmedium, and they’re extremely intelligent.So I have a great deal of respect for underwater birthing. And the possibility of having dolphins there at the same timeis truly a gift. I think it’s a healthy trend the way many countries are allowing this new way to birth, though in the UnitedStates there’s a lot of pressure against it. Lately in the U.S., the pressure seems to have subsided, and I think you can dothis legally now in Florida and California. Around the world, in New Zealand, Australia and other places, there are lots ofcenters. And, of course, the more women see other women not in pain, obviously they’re going to want to do it, too.Geometries That Surround the BodyHere we go with the next adventure. We’ve now seen how the geometries unfold in conception. We saw how westarted with a little cube of eight cells, which became the center of our bodies. Now I want to look at the geometriesoutside the body. The way the angels explained it to me is the way I’m going to give it to you."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"194This began when I was in Boulder, Colorado, sometime between 1976 and 1978; I can’t pinpoint it for sure. I wasliving in a communal home with a bunch of friends and had my own bedroom. One night the angels came in with a newteaching for me. They showed me the geometries by projecting glowing forms in space. It would be like holographicimages that would appear maybe seven or eight feet away from me, and I’d work with them from there. In my room theangels showed me this image of a circle and a square [Fig. 7-20]. They said they wanted meto find this image in Metatron’s Cube [Fig. 7-21]. Then they said good-bye and left, leavingme with no real instructions on how to proceed.After they left, I figured this wouldn’t be too hard, because they were always giving melittle things to do. I’d do them, wait for them to come back, then they’d give me somethingelse to do. I figured it wouldn’t take long. But as I found out, it wasn’t that easy. At least fourmonths went by and I still couldn’t figure it out. The way I see it, the angels interveneddirectly to help me with this.I was sitting there in my room one night around nine, the floor covered with drawings. (Iused my floor as a table because I had so many drawings.) My door was closed, and I wassitting there studying my drawings, trying to solve the problem the angels had given me. Ihad so many drawings you wouldn’t believe it, trying to figure out where the circle and thesquare were in Metatron’s Cube.In those days I didn’t tell anybody what I was doing; I didn’t tell peoplefor a long, long time because it was a very personal experience for me.And quite frankly, nobody was interested anyway. Nobody cared aboutgeometry back then, because it had not emerged into most people’s con-sciousness as it has now.The Masonic Key to Squaring the CircleSomeone knocked on the door. I opened my bedroom door, and here’sthis tall guy standing there. I had never seen him before in my life. He lookedkind of sheepish, and he said, “I was supposed to come here to tell you somethings.” I asked his name and more about what he wanted.“Well,” he said, “I was sent here by the Masons to tell you about the circleand the square.”This really jolted me. I sort of froze in my tracks and just looked at him fora moment, try-to understand how this was in happening. Then I figured I did-n’t really care how it was happening, only that it was. I just grabbed him by theFig. 7-20. The circle and the square.Fig. 7-21. Metatron’s Cube."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"195hand and said, “Get in here,” pulling him in and closing the door. Isaid, “Anything you have to tell me, I want to know what it is.” So hedrew this drawing [Fig. 7-22].First he drew the square, then he drew the circle around thesquare in a particular way— and there was the image I had seenglowing in the room! I thought, This is going to be good. He dividedthe square into four sections, then he drew diagonals from the cor-ners through the middle to the opposite corners. Then he drew diag-onals through the four smaller squares. Then he drew lines from I toE and E to J. Next he drew lines from I to H and H to J (E and H beingthe points on the circle’s circumference where the vertical center lineintersects it).Up to this point I’d had no problem, but then he drew a line fromA to nowhere (G) and back to B, and from D to nowhere (F) and backto C. I said, “Wait a minute, that isn’t in the rules I was given. Thatdoesn’t fit—there’s nothing there.” And he said, “It’s okay, becausethis line (A-G) is parallel with that line (I-H), and this line (D-F) is par-allel to this line (J-E).”“Well,” I said, “that’s a new rule. I didn’t have that one before. I mean,there’s nothing there. Parallel lines?—well, okay I’ll listen.”Then he began to tell me all kinds of things. He said that the firstkey is that the circumference of the circle and the perimeter of thesquare are equal, which is what I told you before. This circle andsquare is the same image seen from the air as that of the GreatPyramid with the ship sitting on top.The Phi RThe Phi RThe Phi RThe Phi RThe Phi RatioatioatioatioatioHe began to tell me about the phi ratio of 1.618 (rounded here tothree decimal points). The phi ratio is a very simple relationship. If you had a rod and you were going to put a mark on itsomewhere, only two places would mark the phi ratio, shown as points A and B in his illustration [Fig. 7-23].There are only two places, depending on which end you’re coming from. Shown on the lower drawing, it’s a relation-ship such that if you divide D by C and E by D, the two answers will be the same— 1.618 .... So you divide the longerportion by the shorter portion, and that gives you the ratio 1.618. When you divide the whole length of E by the nextFig. 7-22. The Mason’s drawing."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"196shorter portion, which is D, you’ll get the same ratio. It’s a magical place. Even though I was studying mathematics incollege when this incident took place, the phi ratio somehow had gone over my head. I didn’t get it. I had to go back andrestudy all this stuff.This guy also brought up Leonardo’s drawing with the circleand the square around it, giving me more information, whichI’ll tell you later. I asked him many questions, and about halfthe time he didn’t know the answer. He’d just say, “That’s theway it goes,” or “I don’t know; we don’t know that.” Though Ican’t say this for certain, I suspect the Masons have lost agreat deal of their information. I think that they once had abrilliant knowledge that was very much like the Egyptians’,and both of those disciplineshave gone downhill.Before he left, he drew the sketch at the bottom of his diagram [see Fig. 7-22], with asquare and the right eye of somebody—I can’t say Horus because I don’t know who it is—and then left. I’ve never seen him since. I don’t even remember his name.Applying the Key to MetatronApplying the Key to MetatronApplying the Key to MetatronApplying the Key to MetatronApplying the Key to Metatron’s Cube’s Cube’s Cube’s Cube’s CubeThis gentleman from the Masons didn’t answer the question specifically—how thecircle and the square fit into Metatron’s Cube. In fact, I don’t think he’d ever seenMetatron’s Cube. But something he said triggered something in me so that I under-stood what it was. Right after he left I knew the answer. As you know, Metatron’s Cubeis really a three-dimensional object, not a flat object. Three-dimensionally, Metatron’sCube looks like this [Fig. 7-24]. It’s a cube within a cube, three-dimensionally. Then ifyou rotate it to this view [Fig. 7-25], you have its square aspect.Once you do that, you have Figure 7-26. At this point you can drop the outer aspect; all youneed are just the original eight cells. Around those eight cells there’s already a sphere, the zonapellucida. The cells are in the shape of a cube, so if you draw both a circle and straight linesaround it, you get the image of the circle and the square the angels showed me. I was happy!The Two Concentric Circles/SpheresBut then I calculated the perimeter of the square and the circumference of the circle—and they were not equal. I was bummed out for a long time because I figured I hadn’t foundFig. 7-24. Three-dimensionalMetatron’s Cube, end view.Fig. 7-25. Three-dimesnionalMetatron’s Cube, squared view.Fig. 7-23.

In sacredgeometry, when you find something that appears incorrect or breaks the idea you’re trying toform, you have to keep going deeper, because often you just don’t have the whole picture yet.What I discovered was that the zona pellucida has a thickness to it; there’s an inner surfaceand an outer surface. Every membrane has an outer and an inner surface, and when you use theouter surface of the zona pellucida, the proportions go into a near-perfect phi ratio. The amount ofimperfection is actually part of the equation. (You’ll know what that means in a while.) This is whythere are two lines around the Flower of Life—the inner and the outer circle of the zona pellucida.So from now on, whenever you see four circles in a square, we’re talking about the Egg of Life,the original eight cells. Just take it for granted.So in this drawing [Fig. 7-27] I drew in all the lines that the Mason drew just to see how theywould line up and what would happen, comparing the Mason’s drawing to the eight cells. Nothingappeared to be happening in the middle of the drawing that I could see, though I suspectedsomething at this point, which had to do with a circle that would just fit in the middle of the fourspheres. But I did discover that the comers of the square (a cube, actually) define the exactcenters of the outer layer of cells in the 16-cell division, as at point A. This was an interestingobservation. So I began to doodle and study further to see what they meant. Obviously, theangels wanted me to go down this road, but I had no idea where this road led.Studying da Vinci’s CanonI decided to look deeper at this drawing of Leonardo’s [Fig. 7-28]. I had also ma-jored in art, so I had studied much of Leonardo’s work, but I didn’t realize until later howmuch artwork he had done. This drawing has become probably one of his most famousworks. It’s perhaps even more important to us than the Mona Lisa or any other famouswork of his. This kind of drawing, a standard for something (in this case, a standard forhuman beings), is called a canon, a human canon.The first thing that struck me about this drawing is how amazingly we all attune to it. Forinstance, because there are 30 frames per second that come across on a video, you couldflash this drawing of Leonardo’s for just an instant, yet people would immediately recognizeit. We know something there is important; perhaps we don’t know exactly what it is, but westill retain the image. There is a tremendous amount of information about us in this drawing.But as it turns out, it’s not really about us. It’s about who we used to be, not about who weare now.To begin this analysis, notice first that there are lines drawn over the arms and thetrunk, across the chest and over the legs and neck. The head is divided into another"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198series of lines. Notice that the feet are drawn at both 90 degrees and 45 degrees—subtle things. Also notice that if you were tostand with your arms straight out and your legs straight down, a square or cube forms around your body, as in Leonardo’sdrawing. The center of that square is located exactly where the original eight cells are, which is also a square or cube, in thecenter of your body. Notice the small cube around your original cells and the bigger cube around your adult body.When you are standing with your arms outstretched like Leonardo’s man, there is a difference between the heightand the width of your square. Computers have shown by measuring a hundred people or more that there is one ten-thousandth of an inch difference between the width of your outstretched arms and your height. Though I couldn’t under-stand for a long time why that difference was there, I think I know now. It has to do with the Fibonacci series, which life isbased on. You will see this shortly.If you put your legs out to the side, like the outer legs on Leonardo’s drawing and stretch out your arms like the upperarms, a perfect circle or sphere fits around your body, and its center is located exactly at the navel. When you do that, thecircle and the square exactly touch at the bottom. If you were to move the center of the circle down to the center of thesquare, the circle and the square would synchronize just like they do in the Mason’s drawing and the drawing that showsthe warship superimposed over the top of the Great Pyramid. It is a major secretof life.When you measure almost all the copies of Leonardo’s drawings, you find thatthe circle is really an oval and the square is really a rectangle. It’s different in all ofthem because they’ve been copied and folded so many times. But in the original,accurate drawing, the hand length from the wrist line to the longest finger equals thedistance from the top of the head to the top of the circle when the two centers arealigned; this same length shows up between the navel and the center of the square.So when you bring the two centers together, everything aligns.Phi Ratios in the Human BodyAs I was discovering this, I thought, We have these geometrical forms thatappear to be outside the body as well as inside it. One of the things the angelssaid, which really stuck with me, was that the human body is the measuring stickof the universe—that absolutely everything in the universe can be measuredand determined from our bodies and from the energy fields around them. Sincethe phi ratio seemed to be such an important aspect to the Mason, and since hewent on and on about it, I wanted to see where it was in the human body.I discovered it—and of course other people have also discovered it. Realizethat in Figure 7-29 the square shown is the square around the body as inFig. 7-29. Phi-ratio diagram for the human body."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"199Leonardo’s drawing. And that the line dividing the square in half is the centerline of the human body. Also notice that the line b is not only the diagonal ofone-half of the square, but is also the radius of the circle.Now, if you are interested in the math, see Figure 7-30, which proves that thephi ratio is found in the geometrical energy fields around the body in at least this onerelationship. There are many, many other phi relationships in and around the body.As you can see, the phi ratio = If you put this into your computer, youwill see the transcendental number of phi continue until your computer runs outof memory. I know most of you out there don’t care, but I’ve presented thisinformation for the few.By the way, I’ll just throw this out to you: When you’re studying sacred ge-ometry, you’ll find that diagonals are one of the major keys for extracting infor-mation from your forms (in addition to shadows, expanding from two to threedimensions, comparing male to female and so on). It never fails.I believe it was Buddha who asked his disciples to contemplate their navels.Whoever it was, I began to realize as I studied that there was more to the navel thanmeets the eye. Then I found a medical book, whose authors must have also lis-tened to Buddha, because they did a tremendous amount of research on navels.What the geometries show is that in the ideal, the navel sits at the phi ratio betweenthe top of the head and the bottom of the feet. This is what most books indicate.The authors found out that when a baby is born, its nave! is in the exactgeometrical center of the body. Both male and female babies start out this way,and as they grow, the navel starts to move toward the head. It moves up to thephi ratio, then continues upward. Then it comes back down to below the phiratio, oscillating during the formative years. I don’t know what the ages are, butthese movements and locations happen at specific ages. It never actually stopsat the perfect phi ratio in either males or females, but if I remember correctly, themale navel ends up slightly above the phi ratio and the female navel just belowit. If you average the male and female points, you get the perfect phi ratio. Soeven though Leonardo’s drawing is of a male, it assumes that it is at the phiratio, but of course in nature it would not be.Da Vinci figured out that if you draw a square around the body, then adiagonal from foot to extended fingertip, then draw a parallel line (another oneof those parallel lines) from the navel horizontally over to the side of the square,Fig. 7-30. Equation for the phi ratio."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"200that horizontal line intercepts the diagonal line exactly at its phi ratio [Fig. 7-31] as well as that ofthe vertical line from head to feet. Assuming it’s at that perfect point, not slightly above for femalesor slightly below for males, this means that the human body is divided into phi ratios from top tobottom, which we stated earlier. If these lines were the only places in the human body where thephi ratio is located, it would probably be just an interesting fact. But the truth is, the phi ratio islocated in thousands of places throughout the body, and it is not just a coincidence.Here are some obvious phi-ratio locations in the human body [Fig. 7-32]. The length of eachbone in the finger has a phi ratio to the next bone, as shown in the lower drawing. That same ratiooccurs with all your fingers and toes. This is a somewhat unusual relationship because one fingeris longer than the other in what appears to be an arbitrary fashion, but it’s not ar-bitrary—nothing in the human body is. The distances on the fingers marked A to B to Cto D to E are all in a phi ratio, as well as the lengths of the phalanges, F to G to H.If you compare the length of the hand to the length of the lower arm bone, it has aphi ratio, just like the length of the lower arm bone compared to the upper arm bone. Ortake the length of the foot to the lower leg bone, or that bone to the thigh bone and soon. This phi ratio is found throughout the entire bone structure in all kinds of places andways. It’s usually at places where something bends or changes direction. The bodyalso does it through proportionate sizes of one part to another. If you study this, you willbe continually amazed.Figure 7-33 is another way of showing the phi ratio. You make a curve so that youcan see how one curve is linked with another, and you can see all the cascading phiratios of the human body. This is from The Power of Limits by Gyorgy Doczi. I highlyrecommend this book. Notice that on this male he drew the line for the navel slightlyabove where the actual phi ratio is located. He knew about that, and very few people Ihave read understand it.I want to talk about this Greek statue. The Greeks were well aware of this under-standing of phi ratios. So were the Egyptians and many, many other people in ancienttimes. When they created a piece of art like this, they were actually using both sides ofthe brain simultaneously. They were using their left brain to very carefully measureeverything—I mean really carefully, not kind of or sort of. They were measuring tomake sure that everything was exactly mathematically correct according to the phiproportion. To be as creative as they wanted, they were also using their right brain.They could put any expression on the face and have the statue hold anything or doanything they wanted. The Greeks combined the left and right brain.Fig. 7-31. Leonardo’s drawingwith more lines, one of which(the horizontal line) divides boththe vertical and diagonal.Fig. 7-32.

Butwhen you analyze them, the phi ra-tio is there as well [Fig. 7-37].The other universal measurementyou’ll find, one I talked about before,is 7.23 centimeters, the wavelength ofthe universe. You’ll find this wave-length scattered through the body,such as the distance between youreyes; but the phi ratio occurs moreoften than any other.Once a measurement of anyspecies has been determined, thenevery other measurement in thatspecies follows in the phi-ratio pro-portion. To put it another way, thereare only certain possibilities in humanstructure, and once the size of onepart of the body is determined, thatdetermines the size of the next, andon and on.

This illustrates another point about creativity that I want to make. Whenthey designed and built this structure, they carefully measured every singledistance to match the various lines shown, and they carefully measured whereto put each board—right down to that little ball on the very top, so that it couldcorrespond with and form these relationships we have been studying. I’m sureif someone ever checks, they’ll find that the size of the doors, the windows andprobably every small detail are all based on phi proportions or other sacredgeometry.Other classical architecture around the world used the same principles.The Greek Parthenon looks really different from this Japanese structure, butthe Parthenon embodies the same mathematics. And the Great Pyramid looksvery different from either of those two buildings, but it also embodies the samemathematics—only a lot more. What I’m saying is, your left brain can under-stand and use these mathematics, and it doesn’t hinder creativity at all. It caneven enhance it.Golden Mean Rectangles and Spirals around the BodyGolden Mean Rectangles and Spirals around the BodyGolden Mean Rectangles and Spirals around the BodyGolden Mean Rectangles and Spirals around the BodyGolden Mean Rectangles and Spirals around the BodyAnother sacred form we have in life is the spiral. You may wonder where itcame from. We’re living in a spiral—the galaxy, which has spiral-ing arms. You’reusing spirals to listen to the sounds around you because the little apparatus inyour ears is in a spiral form. There are spirals all over nature. The more youlook, the more you find. Spirals are found in pine cones, sunflowers, a few ani-mal horns, deer antlers, seashells, daisies and lots of plants. If you put youropen hand vertically in front of you, thumb toward your face, notice the move-ment as you roll your fingers into a fist, starting with your little finger. They traceout a Fibonacci spiral. This is a very special spiral, as you will see.Where do spirals come from? They have to come from somewhere, andthey have to be generated out of the dynamics of the original system, theFlower of Life, if what we believe is true. Well, all you have to do is go backto the human body—to the same pattern we came up with for the phi ratio[see Fig. 7-30]. If you simply take the diagonal line, lay it down flat, then com-plete the rectangle formed with that new extension—you have a Golden MeanFig. 7-38. Pagoda of Yakushiji Temple"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"205rectangle, the source of the Golden Mean spiral.The outer rectangle of this drawing [Fig. 7-39] is called a Golden Meanrectangle, the same as above. To get another Golden Mean rectangle, all youhave to do is measure the rectangle’s shorter edge (side A) and plot thatdistance along the longer side (side B), which makes a square (with equalsides; A = C). The area that’s left over (D) is another Golden Mean rectangle.Then you can take the shorter edge again and plot that distance along thelonger edge to make another square, and what’s left over is still another GoldenMean rectangle. This can continue forever. Notice that each newly formedrectangle is turned 90 degrees. If you run diagonals across each rectangle,their crossing locates the exact center of the spiral they form. You can seehow the diagonals become a key for more information: Line F has a GoldenMean ratio to line E, continuing inward. We can say that F is to E what G is toF and H is to G and I is to H and so on. There are other kinds of spirals, butthe Golden Mean spiral is paramount in creation.Male and FMale and FMale and FMale and FMale and Female Spiralsemale Spiralsemale Spiralsemale Spiralsemale SpiralsThere are two kinds of energies that move through Golden Mean rec-tangles. One energy is the diagonals that cross the squares, moving at90-degree turns, shown in black. That’s the male energy. The female en-ergy is the line that keeps curving in toward the center, shown in gray. Soyou have a female Golden Mean logarithmic spiral, along with a male spi-ral that uses straight lines with 90-degree turns at the phi ratio. In much ofthe work I will show you, we’ll be looking only at the male aspect, but youmust remember that the female aspect is always there.Some books say that if you draw a horizontal line through the navel in daVinci’s man [Fig. 7-40], what’s left over in the lower portion is a Golden Meanrectangle; and that if you draw a line from the top corner of the large square tothe middle point at his feet (the center of the opposite side of the square), thatsemi-diagonal will pass through the exact center of a Golden Mean spiral asshown in the figure. You can create a spiral if you draw in the consecutivelysmaller Golden Mean rectangles like we did in Figure 7-39. I’ve read severalbooks about this, and I believe it’s almost true. But something else is actuallyFig. 7-39. The Golden Mean rectangle and maleand female spirals.Fig. 7-40. Leonardo’s canon and spiral."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"206happening that is important to understand if one really wants to know about MotherNature.In fact, I’m convinced that there are no Golden Mean rectangles or spirals in exist-ence unless they’re synthetically made. Nature does not use Golden Mean rectanglesor spirals—it doesn’t know how. The reason nature doesn’t know how is because aGolden Mean spiral will literally go inward forever—maybe not with a pencil and paper,but technically it will go on forever and ever. It will also go outward forever too, becauseyou can take the longest line of any Golden Mean rectangle, make a square to get alarger Golden Mean rectangle and continue to do this forever. So a Golden Mean rect-angle has no beginning and no end. It will go inward and outward forever.This is a problem for Mother Nature. Life doesn’t know how to deal with somethingthat has no beginning and no end. We can sort of deal with something that has no end,but if you think about it, it’s difficult to think of something having no beginning. Just try toget that in your mind—something that has no beginning. This is hard for us because weare geometric beings, and geometry has centers, beginnings.Since life doesn’t know how to deal with this, it has found a way to cheat. It hasfound another spiral to create with. Life figured out a system of mathematics that ap-proximates this so well that you can hardly tell the difference. The books say that thisspiral on Leonardo’s drawing in Figure 7-40 is a Golden Mean spiral, which I say can’tbe true. Also, there is not just one little spiral here; there are eight spirals rotating aroundthe body— one for each Golden Mean rectangle, connected to the eight possible semi-diagonals around the human body [Fig. 7-41]. This drawing shows the eight that inter-sect the human body.Figure 7-42 shows the eight spirals with their eight centers located around the cen-ter of the body, in the same pattern and with the same center as the original eight cellsinside the body—right?Leonardo drew these little lines that make a grid over and around the body [Fig. 7-43]:There are four squares in the center (A, B, C and D, clockwise) and eight squares surround-ing them (E through L). Those outer eight squares happen to be where the eight semi-diagonals of Figure 7-41 intersect the body and where the eight spirals of Figure 7-42 begin.So we have eight places around the body and a central pattern of four squares in themiddle, centered exactly around the original eight cells. Life is amazing, is it not?Fig. 7-41. Diagonal lines made byconnecting corner to the center of theopposite side of the square.Fig. 7-42. Spirals and the originaleight squares.Fig. 7-43.

But when I realized that there’s no such thing as a Golden Mean rectangle or spiral in nature, I began tosuspect that these spirals were probably something slightly different. And that’s what they turned out to be—slightlydifferent.It turns out that these spirals are Fibonacci in nature, which we will explore in the next chapter. Understanding thedifference between the Golden Mean and Fibonacci spirals may seem simple and unimportant, until the bigger picture ofnature unfolds to reveal something astonishing about this relationship. No one can ever understand why the 83,000sacred sites on the Earth were built or what their purpose was without knowing this difference."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"208EIGHTReconciling the Fibonacci-Binary PolarityThe FThe FThe FThe FThe Fibonacci Sequence and Spiralibonacci Sequence and Spiralibonacci Sequence and Spiralibonacci Sequence and Spiralibonacci Sequence and SpiralIn order to understand why those eight spirals around da Vinci’s canonare not Golden Mean spirals and to find out what they are, we have to goto another person—not Leonardo da Vinci, but Leonardo Fibonacci.Fibonacci preceded da Vinci by over 250 years. From what I’ve read abouthim, he was a monastic, often in a meditative state. He loved to walkthrough wooded forests and meditate as he was walking. But evidentlyhis left brain was simultaneously active, because he started to notice thatplants and flowers had number associations [Fig. 8-1].Flower petals and leaf and seed patterns correspond to definite num-bers, and the flowers on this list are the ones I think he saw, if I’ve got itright. He noticed that lilies and irises have three petals and that butter-cups, larkspurs and columbines (the flower at the top right in Fig. 8-1)have five. Some delphiniums have 8 petals, corn marigolds have 13 andsome asters have 21. Daisies almost always have either 34, 55 or 89petals. He began to see these same numbers over and over again through-out nature.This little plant [Fig. 8-2] doesn’t actually exist; we created it with computergraphics, shuffling it around like a deck of cards. The original plant on which thisillustration is based is called the sneezewort; we simply made the computergraphics fit that plant.Fibonacci noticed that when the sneezewort plant first came out of theground, it grew only one leaf, just one little leaf. As it grew taller, farther up on itsstem it grew one more leaf; then a little bit farther it grew two leaves, then three,then five, then eight; then it had thirteen flowers. He probably said, “Gee, thoseare the same numbers I keep seeing in the petals of other flowers—3, 5, 8, 13.”"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"209Eventually this sequence of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 andso on became known as the Fibonacci sequence. If you are given anythree consecutive numbers in this sequence, you can recognize thepattern: you simply add two consecutive numbers to get the next num-ber. See how it works? This is a very special sequence. It’s crucial inlife. Why is ii important? This is perhaps my interpretation of why, but I’lldo my best tc show you.This is a hibiscus flower with five petals [Fig. 8-3]. Th( stamen in-side has five terminating buds, and the directior of those two geomet-ric forms are reversed to each other one set pointing up and one point-ing down. When mosi people look at this flower, they don’t think, “Let’ssee, it has five petals.” They simply look at it, notice it’s beautiful smellit and experience it from their right brain. They’re not thinking about thegeometry or mathematics going or in the other side of the brain.Life’s Solution to the Infinite Golden Mean (Phi) SpiralLife’s Solution to the Infinite Golden Mean (Phi) SpiralLife’s Solution to the Infinite Golden Mean (Phi) SpiralLife’s Solution to the Infinite Golden Mean (Phi) SpiralLife’s Solution to the Infinite Golden Mean (Phi) SpiralRemember that I said how the Golden Mean spiral has no begin-ning and no end, and that life has a hard time witr that? It can cope withno end, but it has a difficult time grokking something that has no begin-ning. I have a really hard time doing it, and I think we all wrestle withthat situation.What nature did was create the Fibonacci sequence to get aroundthe problem. It’s like God said, “Okay, go out there and create with theGolden Mean spiral,” and we said, “We don’t know how.” So we madeup something that is not the Golden Mean spiral, but it rapidly comesso close that you can hardly tell the difference [Fig. 8-4].For example, the phi ratio associated with the Golden Mean is ap-proximated by 1.6180339. Look what happens when you divide eachnumber in the Fibonacci sequence into the next higher number. Here’sthe sequence in the left column: 1, 2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89. In the sec-ond column I’ve shifted the sequence by one so we can divide thenumber in the first column by the number in the second column (seecolumn 3). Notice what happens when you divide a column-two num-"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"210ber into the one in column one. When we divide 1 into 1, we get 1.0. Now, 1.0is a lot iess than the phi ratio. But when we go to the next line and divide 1 into2, we get 2, which is greater than phi, but closer than 1 is. When we divide 2into 3 we get 1.5, which is a lot closer to phi than either of the previous twoanswers, but it’s under.Three into 5 is 1.6666, which is over, but a lot closer. Five into 8 is 1.60,and it’s under. Eight into 13 is 1.625, which is over. Thirteen into 21 is 1.615,under. Twenty-oneinto34 is 1.619, over. Thirty-four into 5 5, 1.617, under. Fifty-five into 89, 1.6181, over. The next one goes under, then over, each timegetting closer and closer to the actual phi ratio. This is called asymptoticallyreaching a limit. It can never ever reach the actual number, but practicallyspeaking, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference after a few divisions. Youcan see this graphically in Figure 8-5.The light gray squares are the four central squares of the human bodywhere the original eight cells are located. The eight dark gray squares aroundthese central squares are where the spirals begin. Does everybody get that?Rather than having them spiraling in forever and ever, we’re going to dosomething different—because this is what life does, I believe. I’m going to useone of the outer squares as my starting point, and this will be true for all eight.I’m choosing one of them as an example.Using a diagonal across just one of the tiny background squares as ourmeasure, we’ll call this diagonal line one unit. Then we move according to theFibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2,3, 5,8, 13, 21, 34, 89, with a 90-degree turn aftereach number. In our first step we go one length, then turn 90 degrees and goone again. Then we turn 90 degrees and go two lengths, turn another 90degrees and go three lengths. Between each step we take a 90-degree turn.The next step is 5 units long, then 8. So we have 1,1,2, 3, 5, 8, 13.Then we diagonally cross 21 squares, then 34 [Fig. 8-6]. Then 55, then89 [Fig. 8-7]. As we do this, the spiral unfolds and gets closer and closer tophi, the Golden Mean spiral, until very rapidly there’s no way to tell the differ-ence in life, at least visually.Comparing the two spirals must have been a very important feature if onestudied life, because the ancient Egyptians displayed both the Fibonacci andthe Golden Mean spirals at the Great Pyramid. Even though the spirals havetwo different origins, by the time they get out to steps 55 and 89, the two linesare practically identical. When people who studied Egypt saw the three pyra-mids lined up on the spiral, they thought it was the Golden Mean, not theFibonacci spiral. Then they came back and found one of the holes (refer to"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"211page 109). Several years later they realized that just a little ways away,maybe a hundred yards or so, was another marker. They hadn’t realizedthere were two spirals. I don’t know whether the people working with thisunderstand its significance even yet.Spirals in NatureHere is sacred geometry in nature [Fig. 8-8], the real thing. It’s anautilus shell cut in half. It’s an unwritten rule that every good sacredgeometry book has to have a nautilus shell in it. Many books say this is aGolden Mean spiral, but it’s not—it’s a Fibonacci spiral.You can see the perfection of the arms of the spiral, but if you look at thecenter or beginning, it doesn’t look so perfect. You can’t really see this detailhere. I suggest that you look at a real one. This innermost end actually hitsthe other side and bends, because its value is 1.0, which is a long ways fromphi. The second and third ones bend also, but not as much because they are coming closer tophi. Then they start fitting better and better, until you see this perfectly graceful form developing.You could think that the little nautilus made a mistake in the beginning; it looks like he didn’tknow what he was doing. But he’s doing it perfectly, it’s not a mistake. He’s simply followingexactly the mathematics of the Fibonacci sequence.On this pine cone [Fig. 8-9] you see a doublespiral, one going one way and one going the other. Ifyou were to count the number of spirals rotating onedirection and those going the other direction, you’dfind that they’re always two consecutive Fibonaccinumbers. There are perhaps 8 going one way and13 the other, or 13 going one way and 21 the other.The many other double-spiral patterns found through-out nature correspond to this in all cases that I know.For instance, the sunflower spirals are always relatedto the Fibonacci sequence.Figure 8-10 shows the difference between the two. The Golden Mean spiral is theideal. It’s like God, the Source. As you can see, the top four squares on both drawingsare the same size. The difference is in the areas where they originate (the bottom sec-Fig. 8-10. Comparing Fibonacci and Golden meanspirals"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212tions of the two diagrams). The bottom of the Fibonacci spiral has an area half thesize (0.5) of the area above; the Golden Mean spiral has an area 0.618 the size ofthe area above. The Fibonacci spiral shown at near right is constructed using sixequal squares, whereas the Golden Mean spiral starts deeper inside (actually, itnever starts—it has been going on forever like God). Even though the originatingpoint is different, they very quickly approximate each other.Another example: Many books state that the King’s Chamber is a Golden Meanrectangle, but it’s not. It’s also tied to Fibonacci.FFFFFibonacci Spirals around Humansibonacci Spirals around Humansibonacci Spirals around Humansibonacci Spirals around Humansibonacci Spirals around HumansWhen we draw a 64-square grid and incorporate this spiral pattern, we getFigure 8-11. Superimposing da Vinci’s canon over this 8-by-8 grid [Fig. 8-12],the eight squares (shaded) seem to have a unique attribute. There are fourpossible ways to move a Fibonacci spiral out of one of the four double squares.Returning to Figure 8-11, let’s use the upper double square as an example.One way to start is from the upper right corner, as shown by the darker line. Itcrosses one square (1), turns right to cross one more square (1), turns rightagain to cross two squares (2)—interestingly enough, it reaches the top of thegrid at this point. Continuing to turn right, it crosses 3 (the next number in thesequence)—and, son-of-a-gun, it has now reached the right side of the grid!The next number is 5, which takes the line to the bottom of the grid. The follow-ing number, 8, takes the line across three squares before it leaves the grid.There’s a perfect reflective quality as this spiral moves out from the beginningsquare.Another way you could start in this double square is from the lower rightcorner, as shown by the lighter line (this forms a little pyramid in the top twosquares. In this case your 90-degree turns will be to the left. So you cross onesquare (1), then one again (1), then 2—this time passing through the centerfour squares of the grid (where the original eight cells reside). After turning leftagain to cross 3 squares, the line touches the right side of the grid. The nextnumber, 5, will leave the grid after crossing two squares. It’s a perfectsynchronicity of movement. Whenever you see this kind of perfection, youknow you’re almost surely hitting on really basic geometries."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"213All this is crucial to understand, if you careto know, how the Egyptians achieved resurrec-tion.

In fact, there’s an entirely new science happeningaround it, though it’s having a hard time getting out because of politics. Thisnew science is called zero-point technology. This grid is, I believe, the geometryof zero-point technology, though most scientists see it in a different way.Most people involved in zero-point technology think of it in terms of wave-forms or energy. They talk about the five places in a waveform, as shown here[Fig. 8-13]. Or they think of zero point as the amount of energy that matter haswhen (and if) it reaches zero degrees Kelvin, or absolute zero. To me, both ofthese ways are valid, but the way based on sacred geometry will eventuallybecome the cornerstone of this new science because it is so fundamental.These points associated with the waveform are also related to breathing.These points are where the zero point is accessed. They are like doorways intoanother world. Yogic pranayama is usually talked about in terms of two or threeplaces (depending on whether you count the beginning of the next cycle), whichare between the inbreath and the outbreath. That’s also zero-point technologyif you focus it on human breathing.This new zero-point understanding has a geometry behind it, and that ge-ometry is around the human body. The human body is always the measuringstick of creation.UPDATE: Since the time of Tesla, govern-ments have not allowed the knowledge of zeropoint to come forth. Why? Tesia wanted to givefree, unlimited energy to the world, which heknew would come from zero-point technology.But J.P. Morgan, who owned many coppermines, did not want electricity to be free. In-stead, he wanted to force electricity to passthrough copper wires so he could meter it,charge the public and make money. Tesia wasstopped, and the world has been controlledever since.Since that time in the 1940s, any personwho researched zero-point technology andtalked publicly about it was killed or disap-peared—until just recently. In 1997 a videocompany called Light works secretly broughttogether a few of these scientists and filmedtheir works.They gave the history of what had hap-pened since the 1940s and showed clear work-ing models of the inventions. They showedmachines that, once running, give of f moreelectricity than it takes to run them. Theyshowed batteries that never need charging.They showed how an ordinary gasoline motorcan be converted to run on ordinary water withmore power than gas. They showed panels thatwill produce boiling water forever as long asthe out side temperature is above 40 degreesbelow zero Fahrenheit. They showed manyother scientific inventions considered impos-sible by today’s standards. When Lightworkswas done, on a single day the video was re-leased and the information put on a Web site[“Free Energy: The Race to Zero Point.” 105-minute video by Lightworks (800) 795-8273,$40.45 ppd; www.lightworks.com]. This hasforced the world to change direction. Two"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"214weeks later both Japan and England announcedthat they are very close to solving the cold-fu-sion problem. The world began to change.On February 13, 1998, Germany issued aworld patent on a free-energy machine basedon carbon, a thin sheet of material that willproduce 400 watts of electricity forever. Thismeans that all small appliances such as com-puters, hair dryers, blenders, flashlights etc.will not need to be plugged into the system.

Wetalked about this before. However, now we are goingto introduce a new concept. The originating point ofthe spiral in this geometric pattern will further deter-mine if it is male or female in a different way. In a doublesquare there are four corners where a spiral can origi-nate: top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right[see Fig. 8-14]. The two top positions produce malespirals, the two bottom positions, female spirals. Themale spiral lines never pass through the center foursquares; the female lines always do.Figure 8-15 shows the two kinds of male and fe-male spirals and how they joints move throughthis geometric pattern.To make it clear, we will give an example. Ifthe spiral begins at the top right point, it will be amale spiral relative to this geometrical pattern. Inaddition, the curved aspect of this male spiralwould be female, and the straight-line aspectwould be male. Every polarity always has anotherpolarity within it, and within that new polarity thereis always still another polarity. This division pro-cess will continue theoretically forever.Figure 8-16 is an example of the male-origi-nating spirals that begin at the top (meaning thegreatest distance from center), but showing onlytheir female (curved) aspect. This drawing shows all eight possible male-origi-nating spirals that exist around the body, from a Fibonacci perspective, in theirfemale (curved) form. They carry the Fibonacci sequence only as far as 5 (1-1-2-3-5). In this limited arrangement it’s interesting to note how the curved spi-rals do a sort of loop-to-loop. The energy could actually become each other and"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"215recirculate. This Fibonacci movement is what I believe is really going onaround the human body, not the Golden Mean that most books claim.In Figure 8-17 we see male-originating spirals around the human body.Here we show the male (straight-line) aspect but only two with femalecurved lines.In Figure 8-18 we see the female spirals around the human body, whichoriginate at the bottom, or closest points to center. Here we show primarily themale (straight-line) aspect of these female spirals. The female (curved) as-pect of only two female spirals are shown (not all eight), which form a heart.Notice the pattern they create. One heart faces one way, and after it has beenextended 180 degrees, a bigger heart faces the other way. Every one of thesecurved female lines passes through zero point at the exact center of the hu-man body. This zero point is the creation point, or what we would call thewomb. It is for this reason that females have the womb in their bodies andmales do not. Males never pass through zero point. Later you’ll see theseheart-shaped relationships tied to many other natural phenomena such aslight, eyes and emotions, to men-tion a few, so keep them in mind.Now, with that understanding we’re going to look at another sequence.There are thousands of mathematical sequences; I suppose on one levelyou could even say an infinite number. But in useful terms, there are many. Asequence can simply be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. In every one of the thousandsand thousands of sequences known to man, three numbers are required toidentify the pattern, the whole sequence—with the exception of the GoldenMean logarithmic sequence, in which case you need only two. This impliesthat it is probably the source of all other sequences.According to my guidance, two sequences besides the Golden Meanare of major importance to nature and life. They are the Fibonacci sequence,which we just looked at, and the binary sequence we are about to look at.Here we will see the Fibonacci as female and the binary as male. They arereally more than just female and male; they act more as mother and father.They are both primary, coming straight from the Golden Mean, just as thetwo primary colors that come from white light are red and blue."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"216BinarBinarBinarBinarBinary Sequencing in Cell Division and Computersy Sequencing in Cell Division and Computersy Sequencing in Cell Division and Computersy Sequencing in Cell Division and Computersy Sequencing in Cell Division and ComputersThe binary sequence [Fig. 8-19] is a mitosis that simply doubles each time, such asfrom 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to 32. Instead of adding to the last number like we do in theFibonacci sequence, we double it.Let’s look at the binary sequence for a moment. It goes I, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, doubling ateach jump. In order to determine the characteristic of the sequence, all you need to do istake any three consecutive numbers in the sequence—like 2, 4 and 8. You double the 2and get 4, and double the 4 to get 8. It takes three consecutive numbers to positivelyidentify the doubling process.In terms of a pronucleus’s mitotic cell division, by the time the first cells form into theapple shape, there have been nine cell divisions, totaling 512 cells. Holding that in mind,look at these two facts:Fact one (shown in Fig. 8-19): There are 1014 cells in the average human body. That’s100 trillion cells in the average person. That’s a lot ofze-roes. Fact two (in the same figure):An adult human body has to replace two and a half million red blood cells in every secondof life. That definitely sounds like a lot. It would take you about two and a half months just tocount to two and a half million if you were doing it day and night, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Yet if we are to stayalive, our bodies have to create millions of new red blood cellsevery second to replace the dead ones. And the only way thiscan be achieved is through mitotic cell division.You look at it and say, “Well, it’s become 512 with onlynine divisions, so it’s going to have to really go for it to get upto this 100 trillion.” But there’s something almost magical thathappens. Anyone who has studied mathematics knows this,but if you have never studied this before, it feels almost likemagic. This is what happens [Fig. 8-20]: After the next tendivisions, cells have multiplied to over half a million. When itdivides ten more times, there are 536 million.According to Anna C. Pai and Helen Marcus Roberts intheir book, Genetics, Its Concepts and Implications, it takesexactly 46 mitotic cell divisions to reach the 1014 cells of thehuman body. It takes only 46 divisions! It’s magical to me thatthis number—46—happens to be the number of chro-"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"217mosomes we have in the average cell. Chance or coincidence?These numbers are amazing. It’s not amazing if you’ve studied it, because by then you’re often immune to it. But itstill amazes me.I would like to talk about how computers work. I started to mention how we’ve got carbon and silicon arcing back andforth between each other. And who’s making the silicon computers? We are—carbon-based beings. Out of all thevarious mathematical possibilities, we chose the binary sequence as the basis of how the computer works. It’s the basisof the whole computer system, and it’s also one of the primary bases of life itself. I feel sure it was not an accident that wechose the binary sequence, because we are life, and deep inside we know the importance of this sequence.I know most of you probably know this, but nevertheless I want to show how a computer works. Imagine little light switchescalled computer chips, and when you turn on one of these lights, you see the number designated for that chip. If you turn on the1 chip, you see 1. If you have five computer chips in your computer, they’re designated 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16. You can turn these fivechips on or off to get any number between 1 and 31. If you turn on just the 1 chip, you see the number 1. If you turn on thesecond chip, designated as 2, you see the number 2. The same for chip 4, chip 8 and chip 16.By turning on every combination of those five chips and adding them up, you can come up with any number between1 and 31. In other words, if you turn on the first chip, you get 1. Turn the second one on and get 2. And if you turn the firsttwo on at the same time, you get 3. The next one you turn on is 4; 4 and 1 is 5; 4 and 2 is 6; 4 and 2 and 1 is 7. Then for8, you turn on the 8 chip. Eight and 1 is 9; 8 and 2 is 10; 8 and 2 and 1 is 11; 8 and 4 is 12; 8 and 4 and I is 13; 8 and 4and 2 is 14; and 8 and 4 and 2 and I is 15. Then for 16, you turn on the 16 chip. Adding the fifth chip gives you all numbersthrough 31 when they are combined in every possible way.If you add just one more chip and call it 32, now you can get every number between 1 and 63. If you add another chipand call it 64, you can get every number between 1 and 127 and so on. If you have a computer that has 46 chips, you canget every single number between 1 and 100 trillion—just by turning 46 little chips on and off! This is what has enabled theunfoldment of knowledge that’s happening so rapidly on the planet right now. And your body has been using this technol-ogy for millions of years!Searching for the Form behind PolarityI studied the Fibonacci and binary sequences with the guidance of the angels, who were constantly leading methrough it. The more I studied them, the more I personally believed that there must be geometry behind them, a secretform that created these number sequences. Since the angels said that the human body and geometry fields are themeasuring stick of the universe, I suspected strongly that if these two sequences were like two mother/father, male/female components, then there must be a single geometric form hidden behind them, a form that generated both. Isearched for a way to wed them."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"218I looked for this secret for years. For a long time I was very serious about it, then I gave up because I couldn’t figureout what it was. But I always kept one eye open for an answer, always looking for a little clue that would maybe do it. Andone day I got it.The Polar-Graph SolutionA Sixth-Grade Math BookA little boy I was taking care of was in the sixth grade, and he wanted to know about a particular mathematicalproblem. It was a relatively simple problem, but I didn’t remember how to do it. I looked through his book to rememberhow it went so I could explain it. As I was going throughhis book, I saw the geometry I needed—in a sixth-grademath book! The author of the book didn’t understand whatI was seeing, because he was thinking along a totally dif-ferent line. But I saw in the mathematics of it somethingI’d been looking for, and it was the key that tied these twoprimary sequences together.I’m sorry that I don’t remember the name of the bookor the author—it was a long time ago—but it showed apolar graph and its relationship to a Golden Mean spiral.Figure 8-21 is a map of the South Pole on a polar graph.Notice the cross through the center, one line following thex axis and the other the y. Every circle does in fact havethese lines crossing it. We demonstrated this by taking aflat disk about half an inch thick, randomly scattering sandall over it. We held it by a handle underneath and hit itwith a wooden mallet. The sand would rearrange itselfinto a perfectly square cross like you see in this illustra-tion. If we used a sound generator on the disk, the sandwould change into many other geometrical patterns. Butthe very first pattern that emerges by striking a round disk"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"219at a low rate will be a perfectly square cross.When you have a circle with a square cross over it, you take the radius of thecircle as your measuring stick and call it 1 (that makes the calculations very easy).Drawing concentric circles the same distance outward from that first radius gives youa polar graph.Spirals on a Polar GraphThis is how a polar graph usually looks [Fig. 8-22], with 36 radial lines including thevertical and horizontal lines. These lines indicate 360 degrees in 10-degree increments.Then concentric circles are drawn, each one the same distance as the one before, creat-ing eight equal demarcations along each radius, counting the inside circle as one. There’sa great deal of reasoning behind a polar graph. Think first about what it represents. It is atwo-dimensional drawing that attempts to show a three-di-mensional sphere, one of the sacred forms, by projecting it onto a flat surface. It is theshadow form. Casting shadows is one of the sacred ways of obtaining information. Also, apolar graph has both straight lines (male) and circular lines (female) superimposed overeach other—both male and female energies at once.Think of the small central circle as a planet in space. From the surface of the planet, theauthor of the math book plotted a Golden Mean spiral— not Fibonacci, but Golden Mean. Itstarts at the zero radius on the circumference of the little “planet” in the center, and it isplotted one time around, from zero to 360°, or back to zero [Fig. 8-23].Now, to figure out the value of any point, you would use the middle circle as a value ofone (since it represents the distance from the center to the first circle, which we are callingthe “planet”), then count outward to wherever the spiral crosses a radius. Thus on the radiusat 260° (between the fourth and fifth rings) you would have counted outward to roughly 4.5.(Of course, on a computer you could be more accurate.) On the radial line at 210°, the spiral would have reached about3.3. Does everybody understand that?Now, look what happens to the actual data from zero to 360°. At zero degrees the spiral is exactly one circle (radialincrement) away from center, because it’s on the surface of that little sphere or planet. Then it goes around throughdifferent changes until it gets to 120°, where the spiral crosses the second circle. The spiral continues outward to thefourth circle, exactly where the 240° radial line sits. And it reaches the eighth (outer) circle precisely at the 360° (also 0°)radius. The radial increments have doubled (a binary sequence of 1, 2,4,8) at exactly 0°. 120°, 240° and 360°."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"220Notice Figure 8-24, which shows the crossing pointsof the spiral. The white stars to the left of the radial-incre-ment column show where the binary sequence crosses aradius. The black stars show how the spiral advances, ina Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8), crossing radials at120°, 190°, 280° and 360°. Both sequences simulta-neously reach full circle (360°), though in differing incre-ments, following thisGolden Mean spiral. This spiral, shown on a polargraph, has integrated the binary and Fibonacci se-quences!I was so excited, I was doing cartwheels for a few days.I knew I had found something really extraordinary, eventhough I didn’t fully know what it was. (This is another one ofmy weaknesses I have to admit to here. Once I saw it, Iknew that if I decoded one of the patterns, it would be truefor the other one, and I’ve never gone back even to look atthe other pattern, which is probably equally as interesting.)But I did analyze what a binary sequence does. The spiral crosses at 0, 120, 240 and 360 degrees. As you can see, thatforms an equilateral triangle [Fig. 8-25]. If this binary spiral kept going outward, it would cross radii at further increments of 16,32, 64 and so on, yet always hit those three 120-, 240-, and 360-degree radial lines as they too are extended.You not only have a triangle, but you’re actually looking at a three-dimensional tetrahedron, because the 120-, 240-and 360-degree radii extend to the center forming the top view of a tetrahedron as well as a side view.Keith CritchlowKeith CritchlowKeith CritchlowKeith CritchlowKeith Critchlow’s T’s T’s T’s T’s Triangles and Their Musical Significanceriangles and Their Musical Significanceriangles and Their Musical Significanceriangles and Their Musical Significanceriangles and Their Musical SignificanceAnother image on this drawing is an equilateral triangle with the horizontal line running straight through the middlefrom 0 to 180 degrees. This is the side view of the tetrahedron. Now, you might not think that’s important, and I probablywould have never picked up on it, but another person did—Keith Critchlow. We don’t know what he was thinking or howhe arrived at this. He didn’t know what you know right now when he did it. (He may know it now after he’s seen this work,but he didn’t when he wrote his book.)Figure 8-26 is Critchlow’s work. He drew an equilateral triangle with a line through the middle; then he measured tothe middle of the center line (see black dot) and drew a line down to the corner and up to the top edge and then verticallydown to the center line, as shown. Who knows why? Where that first diagonal line crossed the center line, he then drew"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"221a vertical line to the upper edge, then down to the same lower corner. Using the point where itcrossed the center line, he repeated what he had done before, then did it once more to theleft. You could keep going in both directions from your first line. By drawing this funny littleform, he discovered something of great importance.He says, “Continuing in this way” (in that pattern of construction), “each successive pro-portion will be the harmonic mean between the previous proportion and the total length, andall these proportions will be musically significant, 1/2 being the octave, 2/3 being the fifth, 4/5,being the major third, 8/9 being the major tone [step] and 16/17 being the half tone [half step]. Inother words, he’s comparing the measurement of these lines to musical tones.He then tried measuring it in a different way, starting at a different point [Fig. 8-27] of thecenter line, at three-fourths (see black dot), and found that the measurements were 1/7, 1/4, 2/5,4/7, 8/11 and 16/l9—and all these numbers are musically significant.This is very, very interesting. It means that the harmonics of music are somehow re-lated to the proportions of this central line moving through a tetrahedron. But he had tomeasure first to begin, and if you have to use a measuring stick, you’re not at the core ofsacred geometry; something’s missing. If you’re right in sacred geometry, you never haveto use anything to measure. The measuring apparatus is built in so that you can calculateeverything without having any kind of calculus or ruler or anything else. It’s always builtright into the system.I experimented with his drawings anddiscovered that if I put the polar graph be-hind his pattern, I could reproduce his firstpattern, which showed the octave—thehalfway mark—without any measuring[Fig. 8-28].All I had to do was draw over a line thatwas already there from the lowest apex ofthe triangle through the center of the sphereto the opposite side of the triangle; when Idropped the line straight down, it dividedthe center line exactly in half, which wasthe octave point Critchlow had found. Thenthe other three lines could automatically bedrawn."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"222I then discovered that the outermost circle of the polar graph, which circumscribes the equilateral triangle, was alsoharmonic to the central line: the vertical line at 60 degrees (line A) exactly overlies line B. There is a correspondencebetween the male (straight lines) and the female (curved lines) components inside and outside the triangle, and theseproportions were all musically significant. And I didn’t have to measure anything!We have now taken this light-years beyond the above. A research tearr has found that you can draw these lines notonly from the center, but frorr any of the nodal points inside the upper half of the triangle, and you wil come up with allknown harmonics in existence. In other words, if yoi draw a line from any of the points where the straight and curved linescros; from 0 to 120 degrees, then down to the corner of the primary triangle an( start making your patterns, you’ll comeup with all the harmonic systems not only the Western keyboard, but the Eastern systems as well—in fact, al knownharmonic systems and many unknown ones that have never been used.People who have done this research now believe that all the laws of physics can be derived from musical harmonics,now that the full system c harmonics has been revealed. I personally believe that the harmonics c music and the laws ofphysics are interrelated, and we now believe we’v proven this mathematically and geometrically, though it is not fullyshowl here.I was very excited at the time I was gathering this information, becaus the implications are incredible. It means thatthe harmonics of music ar located inside a tetrahedron, and that these harmonics are now determina ble. Since thenwe’ve discovered another geometric pattern behind th one shown in this illustration that reveals all the keys, and it hasopened u all the inner meanings of what Egypt was about.The Egyptians reduced their entire philosophy to the square roots of 2, 3, and 5 and the 3-4-5 triangle. Many peoplehave given explanations for it, but there’s another explanation hidden behind the geometry of the tetrahedron. That ideaprobably went over almost everybody’s head, including mine, in a way. But it’s there and we’re working on it now.Black- and White-Light SpiralsWhile I was working on the harmonics of music, I got a postcard in the mail. The postcard was a polar graph withreflective surfaces [Fig. 8-29]. It had little reflectors in each component. I want you to see how light reflects off a polargraph. It reflects off what appears to be a Golden Mean or Fibonacci spiral.There are two arms of the spiral, one opposite the other, exactly 180 degrees apart. Notice that between the reflect-ing arms the light goes very dark. The black-light spirals are rotating at 180 degrees to each other and 90 degrees to thewhite light. (We’ve seen that before in the swirling galaxy.) If you look right in the center, you can see that the two oppositearms are exactly 180 degrees to each other.This is where we’ve seen it before [Fig. 8-30]. Here a white-light spiral comes out in one direction, and 180 degreesfrom it another white-light spiral goes out in the opposite direction. The dark arms—the feminine ones—come out be-tween the light ones. That explains why the black light between the light arms of the spiral is different from the blackness"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"223Fig. 8-30. Swirling galaxy.in the rest of space [see Fig. 2-35], as scientists have discov-ered, because the black light within a spiral is the feminineenergy, and the darkness out in space is Void, not the same.The scientists couldn’t quite understand why it was different.Maps for the Left Brain and Their EmotionalComponentThere’s one more simple teaching I would like to givehere. Drawing the tetrahedron over the polar graph geo-metrically represents the harmonics of music. That drawingand the information I’ve given you on this subject comesinto your understanding through your left brain. But do youremember how we went through those visualizations, whereI was saying that every line on a page is not a line on apage, but a map of how spirit moves through the Void? Sothese drawings are maps—for the left brain.But there’s another component that’s equally importantto understand: Besides being a map of how Spirit moves inthe Void, the lines on any sacred-geometry drawing alsorepresent something else. For every line in sacred geom-etry, there is always an associated emotional and experi-ential aspect. There is not only a mental component, but anemotional component that can also be experienced. A sa-cred-geometry drawing can enter human consciousnessthrough the left brain, but there is a way that it can alsoenter experientially through the right brain. Sometimes thisemotional/experiential component is not obvious.What does this mean? Let’s use music as an example.Music can come into human experience as sound and beheard and felt inside us, or it can be understood by the leftbrain as proportion and mathematics. As you study sacredgeometry, remember that both sides of the brain use thesame information differently."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224[Here Drunvalo played a Sioux Lakota flute to give students a direct experience.He asked them to close their eyes and experience the music instead of mentallystudying or thinking about it.]Form and the sacred geometry associated with it are the source, but the waythis information enters the human experience is different. It’s usually a lot easier totake in information experientially through the right brain than through the logical leftbrain, but they’re equivalent. It’s hard to see that they’re equivalent, but they are.Throughout all this geometry, as you look at these triangles and squares around thebody and the relating spheres and shapes, some kind of experience is associatedwith each geometry. Maybe you don’t know what the particular experience is. It mighttake a whole lifetime to figure out what it relates to, but it’s my belief that there isalways an experiential aspect associated with every sacred geometrical form.Arriving Back at the Fruit of Life through the Second InformationalSystemNow I’m going to give a kind of bottom line for all this. Remember that weplotted this triangle, and its apexes hit at 0, 120 and 240 degrees, then we addedthese lines [see Fig. 8-28 on p. 224] ? But in nature, like in the galaxy, there’s notjust one spiral, but two, going out from the center in opposite ways (see Figs. 8-29 and 8-30). So if you copy nature, you would have to plot two spirals, which willproduce two opposing triangles on the polar graph [Fig. 8-31]. If you look care-fully, it actually produces two tetrahedrons—more specifically, it’s a star tetrahedroninscribed inside the sphere.If you’ve seen Richard Hoagland’s work, do you remember what the messageon Mars at Cydonia was? It was a star tetrahedron inside a sphere. If you haven’tseen Richard Hoagland’s work, I suggest you look at what he showed the UnitedNations. Though science is just beginning to understand what this is about, what Mr.Hoagland showed them will probably make a lot of sense to you now.Inside the star tetrahedron in the sphere, there’s another star tetrahedron[Fig. 8-32]. And inside the smaller tetrahedron a sphere fits perfectly . If you takethat size sphere and center it on each one of the points of the tetrahedrons, you endup with the Fruit of Life. If I rotate this drawing 30 degrees and get rid of some of thelines, you can see the result more clearly [Fig. 8-33]."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"225What you just saw, only in reverse image, was the second informational system of the Fruit of Life. All the informationabove with the star tetrahedron, Golden Mean spirals, light, sound and the harmonics of music and so on came from thissecond information system.I could have started with the Fruit of Life and gone back the other way, but it isn’t how it happened to me. I wanted to showyou that the second information system is accessed by connecting the concentric circles of the Fruit of Life with radial linescoming out/rom the center, rather than connecting all the centers together as we did to find the Platonic solids and the informa-tion on crystals. It is just a different way to superimpose male lines over the female lines of the Fruit of Life.In the first system of information—Metatron’s Cube—we came up with the structural patterns of the universe basedon the five Platonic solids. These appear in lattice structures of metals and crystals and in many other patterns in naturethat we didn’t talk about. The diatoms that make up diatomaceous earth were one of the first life forms in the world, anddiatoms are nothing but little geometric patterns, or functions of the patterns. What you have just been shown is howlight, sound and the harmonics of music are interrelated through a star tetrahedral field inscribed inside a sphere thatcame directly out of the Fruit of Life, the third rotational pattern of Genesis [Fig. 8-34]."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"226AFTERWORDIt is now becoming clear that geometry—and thereby proportion—is the hidden law of nature. It is even more funda-mental than mathematics, for all the laws of nature can be derived directly from sacred geometry.In the second part of this work we will show you more of nature’s secrets. We believe it will begin to change the wayyou see the world you live in. It will become clear that your body is the measuring stick or the holographic image of theuniverse, and that you, the spirit, play a more important role in life than society has taught us.Finally (and this will be paramount in this work), you will begin to see how the geometries are located in the electro-magnetic fields around your body that are about 55 feet in diameter. Remembering these fields is the beginning of humanawakening, like a baby bird breaking into the light and out of the darkness inside its eggshell. The sacred and holy humanlightbody, called the Mer-Ka-Ba by the ancients, becomes a reality. This Mer-Ka-Ba is the “wheels within wheels” ofEzekiel in the Bible. The pathway home through the stars becomes evident as the blueprint of creation emerges.We are intimately connected to the Source of all life. In the remembering of this information will come an awakeningthat will dispel the myth of separation and bring you into the very presence of God. This is my prayer.Until we meet again in volume two, In love and service, Drunvalo"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"227REFERENCESChapter ILiberman, Jacob, Light, the Medicine of the Future, Bear & Co., Santa Fe,NM, 1992.
