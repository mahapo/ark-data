Please distribute anywhere and everywhere.The indication of ‘Satanism’ or ‘Luciferian” presents a question to and from Psychonaut75, a mere idea our evolving work as a band and concept. What can be clear is themusical idea of the adversary, the force which tests and acts as the antagonist/against thenatural order. The Greek word for this is ‘Antinomian’, which is ‘against the law’referring to the separation from the natural order. This shadow force awakens thememories or atavisms which live in the blood.Consider the definition of the Adversary; the shadow or opposite of the presumed naturalorder. Anthropomorphically, we look at this as the archetype of Satan, Ahriman, Set orWotan. This is a force which is constantly in motion; moving and changing as it seeks tomaster time according to its own benefit. The Adversary is always in motion -challenging not only itself; but others as well. It tempts, can see the depths of desire andlusts which sleep deep in the flesh of man and woman, seeking to awaken those atavismsand urges. For this the Church condemned Lucifer as the Devil; and his is calledadversary because it is contrary to the ideals of the Christians. The Adversary asPsychonaut 75 is just one idea; one empowered force which strengthens or destroys thosewho view it; who see this within themselves. Psychonaut 75 is like a gear turning in avery large machine, a sigil in sound itself. That Psychonaut 75 are Satanists is only validin the reflections of those who see that presumed conception within themselves. Themembers of Psychonaut 75 can be confirmed as practitioners of the Left Hand Path but aswell a wide variety of interests in this area manifest in a diverse combination. Pleaseconsider the idea of the Left Hand Path; what is the Left Hand Path exactly?The Left Hand Path derives in title from the Indian Vama Marga, which means ‘left way’and refers to self- liberation from social and psychological ‘norms’, thus if utilized in abalanced and focused goal-driven manner - aids individual consciousness and deifies thepractitioner. The Left Hand Path in a Western sense is the separation from the objectiveor commonly experienced universe. That breaks down that the practitioner isolates his orher consciousness and begins to think as an individual; to pay attention to instincts and toexhalt and drive toward perfected states of refining the psyche. The Left Hand Path is notby any means a simple or blanketed idea - it involves questioning, challenging andhaving the intelligence and strength to be an individual - to be willing to other ideas andnot necessarily adopting those thoughts as your own. In the Yatuk Dinoih I defined theLeft Hand Path as the following-Left Hand Path - The Antinomian (against the current, natural order) path which leadsthrough self-deification (godhood). LHP signifies that humanity has an intellect which isseparate from the natural order, thus in theory and practice may move forward with"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"seeking the mastery of the spirits (referring to the elements of the self) and controlleddirection in a positive area of ones own life - the difference between RHP is they seekunion with the universe, nirvana and bliss. The LHP seeks disunion to grow in perceptionand being, strength and the power of an awakened mind.How does the Left Hand Path come into association with Music?Let us consider what music actually represents - it is an artist expression of emotion andthe imagination. Music often communicates that which cannot be spoken in words, bytone, structure of rhythm or by simple atmosphere. Music can define and invoke moods,introspection, aggression and passion of the listener or performer. It is a potent source ofreflection within the human soul. By this Music(k) and the Left Hand Path areinextricably linked. In Musick (the k added as a reference to Magick as refiningconsciousness) Psychonaut 75 seeks to use music to open the hidden depths of the mind,to initiate states of ecstasy through perceived elements, subjective states such as ‘heaven’and ‘hell’. The term “Black Magick” simply represents the exploration and empowermentthrough hidden areas i.e. helan (anglo-saxon for Hell) or Arezura (the Northern place ofhell in Zoroastrian lore).Luciferian Witchcraft, Paganism and the Left Hand Path reveal that the world is an everchanging,evolving and holds no specific preference to gender or race. It motivates theindividual to achieving self- focused goals - you become what you Will. It is Christianitywhich invented the lines of social separation of classes and created bigotry. Luciferianthought and the Left Hand Path presents the idea that individuals were not created equal,but are unique; each may achieve different levels of self-excellence. Our Gods andGoddesses are modeled from us and our sought after knowledge and desires. Why wouldyou model your life after a religion which seeks to destroy instinct and individuality?How could you invest belief in a religion which tells you to turn your other cheek fromyour enemy? How could you call yourself without laughing a Christian when the termrepresents closing your mind to knowledge of balanced interpretations and seeks thenothingness of blind faith?In response there is Lucifer, who was created as a model for our future possibility - selfwilledexcellence. Lucifer as an anthropomorphic idea is that which seeks wisdomthrough exploring the darkness; he emerges as a bringer of light - the same as theGoddess Lilith. We affirm the devil by prospering and becoming something betterwithout the chains of the Church and its molesting religion. In that very instance we areself-affirmed in doing the devil’s work.The symbolism used in Psychonaut 75 both sonically in terms of sound structure, lyricaladaptations and pictorial imagery is an antinomian experiment of spell casting or sorcery.While images of blood, corpse pale skin, chains, skulls and black magical work is not adefined experience of the musick itself - it creates a gateway of perception of the sonicidea of what P 75 can be depending on the association of the listener."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"It is presumed that music more so than perhaps any art media can be influential beyondcomparison to the youth of the modern world. This, within a multimedia filled world ofcommercial excess and cloning ideologies of follow, don’t think beyond commonlyperceived levels, can show the disastrous side of art. Expression is not only just a form ofart, it is a tool of Magick itself.There is a sense of the primal and modern in Psychonaut 75, while seeking to evolve wedo indeed reach back into those bestial states of raw emotion and energy. It is through themodern technologies at our disposal that we control these chaotic elements and give thema more refined filter and voice - a sense of order. This is the means of our becoming, as avoice to a new antichristian ideal - the rebirth of a consciousness through art. Thenumerical symbolism of P75 is shown through the aim of which we seek to elevate andbecome, 75 itself holds significance to the impressions of certain Cabalistic sequencewhich activates states of being deep within the human psyche. To celebrate the Blackstates of mind, one must be in proper representation of the White aspects of the being.We do not seek blind chaos as a whole, rather a balance from the center of the Eye that isChaos.This can be seen in the logo of P75, being basically a chaos sphere with a very structuredand symbolic center. A human skull in certain manners represents Sorcery, the power ofbeing and the strength of the spirit which seeks to survive past the flesh. The skull is anancient fetish which has been used for thousands of years to be as a totemic guardian of aplace between the living and the dead. The skull also represents a primal seat of powerfor a spirit or shade to reside in; also the chamber of the imagination.The averse pentagram has many connotations in Western culture; many of which inducenegative appearance and assumptions by the public. This is a useful pattern of which P75arise from. The averse pentagram represents to the members of 75 a symbol or rune ofthe Adversary - descending star into the mind of man and woman. It is a liberation ofsorts, a fulgaris lighting bolt which awakens what the Sufis called Shaitan/Azazel; theDivine Imagination which is Iblis. This Black Flame if you will is the source of ourindividual passion, the mind alone and the unlimited possibilities of an opened mind.Opened does not mean find a new way and close it to all others, rather a Christian ideaand practice is it not? No, Opened Mind represents and translates to the Luciferianprocess of self- liberation and self-deification; these states are continual and always inmotion - we are not who we were a year ago. In most cases better, in a sad few worse. Itis our duty as human beings to expand and become, offer something better for thechildren of the world - the future is ours if we only form it in a responsible way. TheSatanic element of Psychonaut 75 calls for an apocalypse of restricted thinking - burn theold order and awaken something new.We are very interested and hold a strong fascination for the combination of both industryand nature - ancient and modern. This is the gift and curse of the age we live in, whenpossibility is joined with failure, where power is misused and clouded in syphilis-ridden"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ideologies meant to only exert power and rape the imagination from others. When youreject and resist the sickness of spirit within; there comes a time when the inner transfersits Will into the outer. Change comes from chaos and Order grows in the center of chaos.The Presumed Opposition of Psychonaut 75 is found in the heart of the Adversary - tooppose and strike back as a serpent or beast of nature. Once the space has been won, thevery area of imagination of where freedom is truly found, we can become something new- initiate a new beginning. Do not restrict yourself; allow for the mind to progress andseek new means of focusing the Will. To affirm the devil is to create the devil, we havethe possibilities at our finger tips."}]
