One of the responses to thatarticle (in the forum) pointed out the existence of one occult order run on Marxistlines, to be found here, and on a first look they seem very interesting.Grading, or to give it the more correct sociological term, stratification is derivedfrom the geological term meaning a system of arranged distinct layers (strata) inrock formations. In sociology these \"layers\" are groups who share some commonfactor or factors, which can be used to differentiate them from other groups.Stratification can be by racial group, gender, age, social class etc; and unlike thefixed nature of the geology, some strata at least are changeable; for examplesocial class, or attainment within an occult order. Also many strata (for exampleage groups) are far less distinct than a change from granite to sand, but howeverinexact, the rock metaphor is used throughout this essay for convenience.Sociologists are generally split into three main camps when looking atstratification; the Marxists, Weberians and Functionalists. A summary of functionalism would (in brief) point out the observed coexistence ofsocial phenomena and interrelation of groups, beliefs and morals in society; whichis seen as a \"seamless web\". There is no distinction made as to what is a causeand what is an effect of this relationship. Also important is the organicistmetaphor (from Herbert Spencer, which owes much to anthropology; the firstcritique of this is that many tribes or occult orders differ, but continue to workwell as societies for which functionalism can offer no explanation, at all). Societyis seen as a pattern of functionally interrelated variables (from Talcott Parsons)with a scheme of functional analysis for each, and the concept of fundamentalnorms and values.The leading early thinker of functionalism, Emile Durkheim believed that a societyremains coherent and cohesive (\"healthy\") due to the consensus will of themajority. Functionalists approve of, if not positively welcome stratification, it isseen as an inevitable and vital part of their system; being a prerequisite of socialorder and function. By the common (or majority) holding of this set of traditionalconsensuses that are agreed to be normal this allows society to run smoothly.From this comes the structural theory, that society is composed of sub-groups,i.e. classes (such as neophyte, practicus, etc); and that these form the buildingblocks of the society. The geological metaphor could be extended here to aquarrying operation where the raw rock of different qualities are removed fromthe earth and arranged in a particular designed order.Durkheim believed that a society functioned as an amalgamation of its groups intoa synergetic, holistic totality; the organicist metaphor of a body with separatespecialised organs etc. To continue this metaphor, he believed that one group hadto be the \"brain\" (i.e. be in conscious and perceived control) in order to prevent chaos and regulate the other functions(other strata-groups). This is the functionalist justification (and overt approval) for stratification;somebody has to be in charge; there have to be levels of merit, and thefunctionalists' initial value consensus of norms, i.e. which groups are moreimportant is by nature hierarchical. With importance comes power, authority andthus control. So long as someone is in control then bodies (i.e. economicsocieties) work smoothly and efficiently; major change within the society is seenas dangerous, as it implies (metaphorical) disease or death of thesmoothly-running organism. This death or disease is obviously to be avoided at allcosts under functionalism; the essence of \"good health\", metaphorical or magical,implied by a widely stratified system was most desirable, being ‘a place foreverything and everything in its' place’."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Articles : Kate Hooluhttp://occultebooks.com/essays/kh/grades.htm2 of 41/25/2007 1:50 PMAs a critique from the Marxist school however, function (if not an historicalaccident which just so conveniently happens to work) is held to imply design,hence a designer and a pre-ordained function. The stratification is often intimatelyallied to or dependent upon the function. The function of each strata has been setup for a purpose; which could be a consensus aim, or to satisfy a pre-arrangedmotive that is not held by the majority. There is not always a definable purpose toall functions, especially in a complex magical society and often those carrying outthe function do not gain any (or all of) the benefit which may accrue from theaction; often their function largely or totally DEFINES their strata.Whether one chooses to see the designer as God or as a mortal there aretheoretical problems; if it is from the Divine then the roles of all in each strata arepre-ordained and it would be heresy to wish to change. This makes no valuejudgment between those of any strata, unlike Marxism.It is unlikely that any sociological theory depending largely or wholly on theexistence of, and understanding of the motives of a God or Gods would be wellreceived in an environment where sociology is attempting to be viewed as ascience. This makes it a difficult technique to use on magical orders. Sociology, orat least Functionalism would largely become another religion, and another meansof stratification is via religious belief, a vicious circle. Fortunately, as mentionedearlier, some change of strata is possible (and Marxism denies the existence ofGod anyway) so is time to thankfully consider the latter, and more likelypossibility, that the designer of the class structure and other means ofstratification was mortal. Since it seems rather unlikely that anyone would design a social structure in whichtheir particular group fell to the LEAST favourable strata, the Marxist view holdsthat stratification is an invention of those already of the top strata (Magi) to keepthe lower strata (neophytes) in their already disadvantaged place, thusperpetuating the differentiation of magical society for reasons of a power dynamic-to the benefit of the occult equivalent of capitalist-industrial structures assistedby arbitrary means of government which deny the chance for social changetowards communism. Indeed functionalism has no coherent theory to explain themechanisms or reasons for social change, hence does not allow it; considering itan illness. Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering the Marxist arguments against it,functionalism on the whole reflects a Conservative bias; ... a la Edmund Burke'sview of the ruling class and their noblesse oblige to the poor; while at the sametime keeping them in their lowly place with the hegemonic tool of religion.The rise (and fall) of the Trade Union movement on Marxist lines under capitalismis an example of where stratification can cause immense harm to a capitalistindustrial society; through the financial (and morale) expenses of strikes, higherwage demands and general labour unrest; this happens due to the circulated knowledge amongst the working classes of astratified system, rather than the existence of the system itself. A metaphor forthe formation of the Illuminates of Thanateros, perhaps?Social Action theories derive largely from Max Weber; who believed that societycomes about almost spontaneously as an aggregate of escalating socialinteractions between progressively larger groups. This eventually leads to theformation of strata. When a strata becomes large enough it can then influence the behaviour of those in other strata; and also the behaviourof itself; by perpetuation of consensus views; or perhaps (negatively) thestereotypes of itself; such as the media image in the UK of the cloth-cap wearingworking-class northerner who keeps pigeons in his back garden and coal in thebath, which although still circulated must be some decades out of date by now, ifit was ever remotely true.Weber had broad agreements with some aspects of functionalism, including theneed for someone to be in control; but his main critique of the functionalists isthat little account was taken of the social and political implications of their (largelyeconomic) ideas; and that functionalism was a rather one-dimensional view of aninfinitely complex inter-related system of disparate influences such as socialstatus (as distinct from pure class) and political belief; Weber saw differencesbetween class (i.e. magical grade) and social status (i.e. importance of theirfunction in that grade) Hence there were too many holes in the logic of Durkheimand his followers for Weber to accept functionalism; he was more allied to Marx,although Marx's class conflict was modified under Weber to class interaction andinfluence; i.e. more two-way and unpredictable. Stratification by virtually any means can be seen as highly negative and divisive;giving rise to stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination and jealousy (in bothdirections on the scale of strata). In this century the practical implications of thestratification of Jews, Gypsies, other minority ethnic groups and the mentallyhandicapped as the \"Untermensch\" by the German Nazi party led to the deaths ofover 8 million people. Unfortunately for all of his attractive theories, Max Weber"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Articles : Kate Hooluhttp://occultebooks.com/essays/kh/grades.htm3 of 41/25/2007 1:50 PMhas been implicated, perhaps unfairly, as the author of the social plans which laterenabled Hitler to assume power over Germany and put the whole idea intooperation.There are continuing problems with stratification in that groups which areidentified as \"different\" in some way, however spurious, are then treateddifferently; on a physiological level Britain still has the highest death toll fromheart disease in the world and that there is a wide, and widening gap in cardiacmortality rates across Britain between rich and poor. The statistics show that thedeath rate from heart disease for men living in the north of England is 25 per centhigher than in the South-east and 28 per cent higher for women; a reflection ofthe class-related \"north-south divide\" perhaps? It would seem so; among men, itis about 40 per cent higher for manual workers than non-manual workers. Thedeath rate for the wives of manual workers is about twice as high as for wives ofnon-manual workers; which may be dietary, or financially related; although this isfar too complex an area to simply assign to one cause.This ties in with my social survey piece here: in that the common indicator of cancer rates related to class is also flawed as it assumes that \"cancer\" is onedisease, whereas there are over 100 types. In much the same way that Brie andCheddar are both cheeses with different qualities, the causes of cancer can behugely varied. Indeed there are certainly apparent links with the (assumed)generally lower-class tendency to smoke; and hence increases in the risk of lungcancer: but equally there are cancers that tend to affect only those of othergroups which are either not class-related or go across class (and other group)lines. Sir Douglas Black, President of the UK’s Royal College of Physicians, produced anextensive report for the Dept of Health in 1980; concluding that for every agegroup (infants, children and adults); for every illness (heart disease, cancer,strokes and accidents), there is a predictable and consistent social class gradient,with the unskilled faring on average twice as badly as the professional middleclass. Black's report favoured poverty as \"the most likely explanation\". The result,it calculated, was the untimely loss of 75,000 lives a year. However it should bementioned that the sword of class division cuts both ways. A report by theSamaritans in 1993 said that a rise in suicides among men from the highest socialclass is being fuelled by pressure to succeed – ie to not be poverty-stricken- andtheir reluctance to discuss their feelings because it might adversely affect theircareers, but that unemployment and poverty may be responsible for an increasein male suicides in the lowest social class.A parallel in the behaviour of those fighting to stay at the top of various magicalorders, anyone?It would appear that there is still great debate over the desirability and usefulnessof stratification, but very little disagreement over its deep entrenchment intoWestern industrial society. The latter point rather defuses any debate oninevitability; we are being asked after the event, with no other industrial societywithout a stratified system to give comparison. The soundbyte of a classlesssociety, however idealised and desired by some, would seem to be virtuallyimpossible in the magical order, let alone wider society- Indeed 80% of the UKpopulace believe that a classless society is a non-starter, and socialclass-ownership of capital is still heavily reflected by political stance; which tendsto maintain the system that services the needs of the voters, hence majorityconcentrations of a particular strata in any given constituency ensure the politicalvoice of that area in parliament.The communism of the former USSR from 1917-1990 can arguably be held as anexample of a successful non-stratified industrial nation; but the relative levels ofindustrial success (expressed as average standard of living improvement for theentire population) must be taken into account, and also the inner stratification which became entrenched almost immediately,with major party figures quickly taking up second homes in the rural huntinglodges and personal fortunes being made from dealings with capitalist economies.There was no non-stratified vacuum in which to operate, indeed on a visit to the west in the 1980s Russian premier Gorbachevbecame especially newsworthy for going shopping using his American ExpressGold card; an expensive status symbol that (relatively) few in the stratified Westpossessed, let alone many of his comrades in the USSR.Even the Israeli kibbutz system, which houses and employs about 4-6% of thepopulation in an overtly communist manner within an industrial-mechanisedagricultural nation shows a defined (and often ill-tempered) split into workers andorganisers. It could perhaps be seen as an interesting experiment without beingable to gain too much sociological theory that could be applied on a larger scale.One would need to set up an entirely new society in order to avoid stratification;"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Articles : Kate Hooluhttp://occultebooks.com/essays/kh/grades.htm4 of 41/25/2007 1:50 PMor take some very extreme steps in social re-planning to eradicate it from acurrent society.
