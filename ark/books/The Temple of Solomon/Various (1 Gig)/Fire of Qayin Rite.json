The edge was ground and thus was made,The narrow road of sharpened blade. This is the metal: ‘twas shaped byCainWho wrought the heavenly Arthame.The rite of the fire of Qayin - Being the mystery of the house of Azazel:The Invocation of the great blood and the mystick Flame, Kindle the mystick Fire uponthe Alter and gaze into its heart, brooding upon the inner Fire and fanning it with eachinhalation of breath as a blacksmith fans the forge with the bellows. The mystick fireburns at the level of the navel within the microcosm.Through the Hollow Reed I bring down the mystick fire fromheaven and draw to the earth the Royal Flame of the Sun bymy Enchantments.The Witch now makes burnt offerings of resinous perfumes and aromatic oils to the fire,worshipping it as the light of the Horned Goat-Angel and also contemplating it as thefiery essence of the Daimon/Genius within.Horned Father of the Hidden Craft, mighty TUBAL QAYIN, oBrother of NAAMAH-LILITH, who didst descend as a serpentof the lightning upon Earth’s ancient mountains, o Bringer oflight, hear the Prayer.In the Brazen Citadel, in the Hall of Flames I call upon thee,Goat-Angel of the Golden Horns, Master of the Primal Fire,AZAEL-QAYIN, appear in thy brilliance."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Thou art He: who fell from the Sun to consecrate humankindwith Sacred Heat.
