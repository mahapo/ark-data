Properlyused, it can heal every affliction and ailment to which mankind is heir. Every single religion affirmsthis fact. All forms of mental or spiritual healing, no matter under what name they travel, promise thesame thing. Even psychoanalysis employs this power, though indirectly, using the now popular wordlibido. For the critical insight and understanding which it brings to bear upon the psyche releasestensions of various kinds, and through this release the healing power latent within and natural to thehuman system operates more freely. Each of these systems undertakes to teach its devotees technicalmethods of thinking or contemplation or prayer such as will, according to the a priori terms of theirown philosophies, renew their bodies and transform their whole environment.None or few of them, however, actually fulfil in a complete way the high promise made at the outset.There seems but little understanding of the practical means whereby the spiritual forces underlyingthe universe and permeating the entire nature of man may be utilised and directed towards thecreation of a new heaven and a new earth. Naturally, without universal co−operation, such an ideal isimpossible for all mankind. Nevertheless, each one for himself may commence the task ofreconstruction.The crucial question, then, is how are we to become aware of this force? What are its nature andproperties? What is the mechanism whereby we can use it?Untapped CurrentsAs I have said before, different systems have evolved widely differing processes by which thestudent might divine the presence of such a power. Meditation, prayer, invocation, emotionalexaltation, and demands made at random upon the universe or the Universal Mind, have been a fewof such methods. In the last resort, if we ignore petty details of a trivial nature, all have this incommon. By turning the fiery penetrating power of the mind inwards upon itself, and exalting theemotional system to a certain pitch, we may become aware of previously unsuspected currents offorce. Currents, moreover, almost electric in their interior sensation, healing and integrating in theireffect.It is the willed use of such a force that is capable of bringing health to body and mind. When directedit acts magnet−like. By this I mean that it attracts to whomsoever employs these methods just thosenecessities of life, material or spiritual, that he urgently requires or which are needed for his furtherevolution.Fundamentally, the underlying idea of the mental healing systems is this. In the ambient atmospheresurrounding us and pervading the structure of each minute body−cell is a spiritual force. This force isomnipresent and infinite. It is present in the most infinitesimal object as it is in the mostproportion−staggering nebula or island universe. It is this force which is life itself. Nothing in thevast expanse of space is dead. Everything pulsates with vibrant life. Even the ultra−microscopicparticles of the atom are alive; in fact the electron is a crystallisation of its electric power.This life force being infinite it follows that man must be saturated − permeated through and throughwith spiritual force. It constitutes his higher self, it is his link with godhead, it is God in man. Everymolecule in his physical system must be soaked with its dynamic energy. Each cell in the bodycontains it in its plenitude. Thus we are brought face to face with the enormous problem underlying1.2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"all disease, the enigmatical problem of nervous depletion.What is Fatigue?How can there be depletion if vitality and cosmic currents of force daily pour through man, simplysaturating his mind and body with its power? Primarily, it is because he offers so much resistance toits flow through him that he becomes tired and ill, the conflict finally culminating in death. How ispuny man able to defy the universe? Nay more, offer resistance and opposition to the very forcewhich underlies, and continually evolves in, the universe? The complacency and confusion of hismental outlook, the moral cowardice by which he was reared, and his false perception of the natureof life − these are the causes of resistance to the inward flow of the spirit. That this is unconscious isno logical obstacle to the force of this argument, as all the depth psychologies have demonstrated.What man is really aware of all the involuntary processes going on within him? Who is conscious ofthe intricate mechanism of his mental processes, of that by which his food is assimilated anddigested, of the circulation of his blood, of the arterial distribution of nourishment to every bodilyorgan? All these are purely involuntary processes: to a large degree so are his resistance’s to life.Man has surrounded himself with a crystallised shell of prejudices and ill−conceived fantasies, anarmour which affords no entrance to light of life without.What wonder he ails? What wonder he is so ill and impotent, helpless and poor? Why should therebe surprise that the average individual is so unable to deal with life?The First Two Steps to HealthThe first step towards freedom and health is a conscious realisation of the vast spiritual reservoir inwhich we live and move and have our being. Repeated intellectual effort to make this part and parcelof one’s mental outlook upon life automatically breaks down or dissolves something of the hardinflexible shell of the mind. And then life and spirit pour abundantly. Health spontaneously arises,and a new life begins as the point of view undergoes this radical change. Moreover, it would appearthat the environment attracts just those people who can help in various ways, and precisely thoseamenities of life that had been longed for.The second step lies in a slightly different direction. Regulated breathing − quite a simple process. Itsnecessity follows from the following postulate. If life is − all about one, all penetrating and allpervasive, what more reasonable than that the very air we breathe from one moment to anothershould be highly charged with vitality? Our breathing processes we therefore regulate accordingly.We contemplate that life is the active principle in the atmosphere. During the practice of thisrhythmical breathing at fixed periods of the day, there should be no strenuous forcing of the mind, noovertaxing of the will. We let the breath flow in while mentally counting very slowly...one, two,three, four. Then we exhale counting the same beat. It is fundamental and important that the initialrhythm, whether it be a four or a ten beat count or any other convenient one, should be maintained.For it is the very rhrythm itself which is responsible for the easy absorption of vitality from without,and the acceleration of the divine power within.RhythmImmutable rhythm is everywhere manifest in the universe. It is a living process whose parts moveand are governed in accordance with the cyclic laws. Look at the sun, the stars, and the planets. Allmove with comparable grace, with a rhythm in their inexorable times. It is only mankind that hasThe Art of True HealingWhat is Fatigue?3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"wandered, in its ignorance and self−complacency, far from the divine cycles of things. We haveinterfered with the rhythmic process inherent in nature. And how sadly have we paid for it!Therefore in attempting to attune ourselves once more to the to the intelligent spiritual powerfunctioning through nature’s mechanism, we attempt, not blindly to copy, but intelligently to adopther methods. Make, therefore, the breathing rhythmical at certain fixed times of the day, when thereis little likelihood of disturbance. Cultivate above all the art of relaxation. Learn to address eachtensed muscle from toe to head as you lie flat on you back in bed. Tell it deliberately to loosen itstension and cease from its unconscious contracture. Think of the blood in response to your commandflowing copiously to each organ, carrying life and nourishment everywhere, producing a state ofglowing radiant health. Only after these preliminary processes have been accomplished should youbegin your rhythmic breathing, slowly and without haste. Gradually as the mind accustoms itself tothe idea, the lungs will take up the rhythm spontaneously. In a few minutes it will have becomeautomatic. The whole process the becomes extremely simple and pleasureable.It would be impossible to overestimate its importance or efficacy. As the lungs take up the rhythm,automatically inhaling and exhaling to a measured beat, so do they communicate it and graduallyextend it to all the surrounding cells and tissue − just as a stone thrown into a pool sends out widelyexpanding ripples and concentric circles of motion. In a few minutes the whole body is vibrating inunison with their movement. Every cell seems to vibrate sympathetically. And very soon, the wholeorganism comes to feel as if it were an inexhaustible storage battery of power. The sensation − and itmust be a sensation is unmistakable.Simple as it is, the exercise is not to be despised. It is upon the mastery of this very easy techniquethat the rest of this system stands. Master it first. Make sure that you can completely relax and thenproduce the rhythmic breath in a few seconds.Mental and Spiritual CentresI now approach an idea fundamental and highly significant. It is the inability to realise or thoroughlyto have grasped its importance which really underlies the frequently observed failure of many mentalculture and spiritual healing systems. Just as in the physical body are specialised organs for theperformance of specialised functions, so in the mental and spiritual nature exist correspondingcentres and organs. Exactly as the teeth, the stomach, liver and intestines are so many mechanismsevolved and devised by nature for the digestion and assimilation of food, so are there similar centresin the other constituents of man’s nature.The mouth receives food. Digestion occurs in the stomach and small intestines. Likewise there is anapparatus for rejecting waste effete products. In the psychic nature also are focal centres for theabsorption of spiritual power from the universe without. Others render its distribution and circulationpossible. The dynamic energy and power entering man from without is not uniform or alike invibratory rate. It may be of too high a voltage, so to say, readily to be endured by him. Within,therefore, is a certain psychic apparatus whereby indiscriminate cosmic currents of energy may beassimilated and digested, their voltage thus becoming stepped down or adjusted to the human level.The process of becoming aware of this psychic apparatus, and using the energy it generates, is anintegral part of this healing system.It is my contention that prayer and contemplative methods unconsciously employ these inner centres.Hence we would be wiser and far more efficient deliberately to employ for our own ends thisspiritual power and the centres it flows through. Let us call these latter, for the moment,The Art of True HealingMental and Spiritual Centres4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"psycho−spiritual organs, of which there are five major ones. Since name them we must, inasmuch asthe human mind loves to classify and tabulate things, let me give them the most non−committal andnon−compromising titles imaginable so that no system of prejudice may be erected thereon. Forconvenience’s sake, the first we may name Spirit, the second Air, the succeeding ones being calledFire, Water and Earth.To illustrate the concept, I reproduce a simple diagram. It shows the position and location of thecentres. Not for one moment do I wish to be understood as stating that these centres are physical innature and position (though there may be glandular parallelisms). They exist in a subtler spiritual orpsychic part of man’s nature. We may even consider them, not as realities themselves, but assymbols of realities, great, redeeming and saving symbols. Under certain conditions we may becomeaware of them in very much the same way as we may become aware of different organs in ourphysical bodies. We often speak of reason as being situated in the head, referring emotion to theheart and instinct to the belly. Similarly, there exists a natural correspondence between these centresand various parts of the body.The Middle PillarThought, Colour and SoundIt is axiomatic to this system that there are three principal engines or means whereby we maybecome aware of the centres to awaken them from their dormant state so that they may functionproperly within. Thought, colour, and sound are the three means. The mind must concentrate itselfon the assumed position of these centres one by one. Then certain names which are to be consideredas vibratory rates must be intoned and vibrated. Finally, each centre is to be visualised as having aparticular colour and shape. The combination of these three agencies gradually awakens the centresfrom their latency. Slowly they become stimulated into functioning each according to its own nature,pouring forth a stream of highly spiritualized energy and power into the body and mind. When,ultimately, their operation becomes habitual and stabilised, the spiritual power they generate may bedirected by will to heal various ailments and diseases both of a psychological and physical nature. Itcan also be communicated by mere laying of hands to another person. Simply by thinking fixedlyand with intent, the energy, moreover, can be communicated from mind to mind telepathically ortransmitted through space to another person miles away − objects in space affording no interruptionor obstacle to its passage.The Coronal SphereFirst of all, the position of the centres, as shown in the diagram, must be memorised. They are to bestimulated into activity either while sitting upright or whilst lying down flat on the back in aperfectly relaxed state. The hands may be folded in the lap, or else, with fingers interlocked, bepermitted to rest loosely below the solar plexus. Calmness of mind should be induced, and severalminutes devoted to rhythmic breathing should result in the sensation of a gentle ripple playing overthe diaphragm.Then imagine above the coronal region of the head a ball or sphere of brilliant white light. Do notforce the imagination to visualise the light sphere. To force would only result in the development ofneuromuscular tension, and this would defeat our end. Let it be done quietly and easily. If the mindwanders, as indeed it will, wait a moment or two and gently lead it back. At the same time vibrate orintone the word Eheieh, pronounced Eh−huh−yeh. After a few days of practice it will become quiteThe Art of True HealingThe Middle Pillar5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"easy to imagine the name vibrating above the head in the so called Spirit centre. This is theindwelling or overshadowing divinity in each of us, the basic spiritual self which we can all drawupon. Eheieh means literally I AM, and this centre represents the I AM consciousness within.The effect of thus mentally directing the vibration is to awaken the centre to dynamic activity. Whenonce it begins to vibrate and rotate light and are felt to emanate downwards upon and into hepersonality. Enormous charges of spiritual power make their way into the brain, and the entire bodyfeels suffused with vitality and life. Even the finger−tips and toes react to the awakening of thecoronal sphere by a faint pricking sensation at first being felt. The name should be intoned during thefirst few weeks of practice in a moderately audible and sonorous tone of voice. As skill is acquired,then the vibration may be practised in silence, the name being imagined and mentally placed in thecentre. If the mind tends to wander, the frequent repetition of the vibration will be found a great helpto concentration.The Air CentreHaving let the mind rest here for some five minutes, when it will be seen to glow and scintillate,imagine that it emits a white shaft downwards through the scull and brain, stopping at the throat.Here it expands to form a second ball of light, which should include a large part of the face, up toand including the eyebrows. If the larynx is conceived to be the centre of the sphere, then thedistance from it to the cervical vertebrae at the back of the neck will be approximately the radius.Naturally this dimension will vary with different people. A similar technique should be pursued withthis sphere, which we name the Air centre, as obtained with the previous one. It should be stronglyand vividly formulated as a scintillating sphere of brilliant white light, shining and glowing fromwithin. The name to be vibrated is Jehovah Elohim − pronounced as Yuh−hoh−voh Eh−loh−heem.1A word or two may not be amiss at this point with regard to the names. In reality they are namesascribed in various part of the Old Testament to God. The variety and variation of these names areattributed to different divine functions. When acting in a certain manner. He is described by thebiblical scribes by one name. When doing something else, another name more appropriate to hisaction is used. The system I am describing now has its roots in the Hebrew mystical tradition. Itsancient innovators were men of exalted religious aspirations and genius. It is only to be expected thata religious bias was projected by them into this scientific psychological system. But it must beexplained that for our present−day purposes no religious connotation is implied by my use of thesebiblical divine names. Anyone can use them without subscribing in the least to the ancient religiousviews − whether he be a Jew, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or atheist. It is a purely empirical systemwhich is successful despite the scepticism or faith of the operator. We today may consider thesesacred names in an entirely different and practical light. They are keynotes of different constituentsof man’s nature, doorways to so many levels of that part of the psyche of which normally we areunconscious. They are vibratory rates or symbolic signatures of the psychophysical centres we aredescribing. Their use as vibratory keynotes awakens into activity the centres with which their rate isin sympathy, conveying to our consciousness some recognition of the several levels of theunconscious spiritual side of our personalities. Hence the actual religious significance does notconcern us. Nor their literal translation.To refer back to the air centre in the throat, let the vibratory sounds be intoned a number of times,until its existence is recognised and clearly felt as a definite sensory experience. There is nomistaking the sensation of its awakening. About the same length of time should be spent formulatingit and the succeeding centres as was devoted to the contemplation of the coronal sphere. This periodhaving elapsed, let it thrust downward from itself, with the aid of imagination, a shaft of light.The Art of True HealingThe Air Centre6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Fire CentreDescending to the region of the solar plexus, just beneath the sternum breast−bone, the shaft expandsonce again to form a third sphere. This is the position of the Fire centre. The allocation of fire to thiscentre is particularly appropriate, for the heart is notoriously associated with the emotional nature,with love and the higher feelings. How often do we not speak of ardent passion, and the flame oflove, and so forth? The diameter of this ambient cardiac sphere should be such as to extend from thefront of the body to the back. Here vibrate the name Jehova Eloah ve−Daas, pronounced asYuh−hoh−voh Eh−loh ve−Dah−ahs. Take care that the intonation vibrates well within theformulated white sphere. If this is done, at once a radiation of warmth will be felt to emanate fromthe centre, gently stimulating all the parts and organs about it. Some students have complained thatthe above divine name is unduly long and difficult to pronounce. After some experimentation, I havesubstituted the Gnostic name IAO for the Hebrew word. Both are attributed, qabalistically, to theSephirah of Tiphareth on the Tree of Life, and so are equally valid. I have found it to be every bit aseffective as the Hebrew name, and in my own practice of this meditation I have permanentlysubstituted the one for the other. IAO should be pronounced eee−(as in key) ah−oh, slowly and withvigour. In point of fact, it is simpler to vibrate this name than almost any other, and the vibration itproduces is clear and strong. Since the mind functions in and through the body, being co−extensivewith it, the mental and emotional faculties likewise become stimulated by the dynamic flow ofenergy from the centres. The hard and fast barrier erected between consciousness and theunconscious, an armoured partition which impedes our free expression and hinders spiritualdevelopment, slowly becomes dissolved. As time goes on, and the practice continues, it maydisappear completely and the personality gradually achieve integration and wholeness. Thus healthspreads to every function of mind and body and happiness ensues as a permanent blessing.The Water CentreContinue the shaft downwards from the solar plexus to the pelvic region, the region of the generativeorgans. Here too, a radiant sphere is to be visualised approximately of the same dimensions as thehigher one. Here also is a name to be intoned so as to produce a rapid vibration in the cells andmolecules of the tissue in that region. Shaddai El Chai is to be pronounced Shah−di El Chi(remember the ch is guttural as in ‘loch’). The mind must be permitted to dwell on the imaginativeformulation for some minutes, visualising the sphere as of a white brilliance. And each time the mindwanders from such a brilliance, as at the beginning it is bound to do, let it gently be coaxed back byrepeated and powerful vibrations of the name.It may be feared that this practice could awaken or stimulate sexual feeling and emotionunnecessarily. In those in whom a sexual conflict is raging such an apprehension is just andlegitimate. Actually, however, the fear is groundless. For the contemplation of the Water centre as asphere of white light connected by a shaft to the higher and more spiritual centres acts rather in amore sedative way. And in point of fact sexual stimulation can be removed, not by ignorant andshort−sighted repression, but by the circulation of such energies through the system by means of thispractice. A thoroughgoing and far−reaching process of sublimation, Alchemical almost in effect,may thus be instigated. This is not to be construed as legitimising the avoidance of the sexualproblem.The Art of True HealingThe Fire Centre7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Earth CentreThe final step is once more to visualise the shaft descending from the reproductive sphere, movingdownwards through the thighs and legs until it strikes the feet. There it expands from a pointapproximately beneath the ankle, and forms a fifth sphere. We have named this one the Earth centre.Let the mind formulate here exactly as before a brilliant dazzling sphere fop the same size as theothers. vibrate the name Adonai ha−Aretz as Ah−doh−ni hah−Ah−retz. Several minutes havingbeen utilised in awakening this centre by fixed and steady thought and by repeated vibration of thename, pause for a short while.The try to visualise clearly the entire shaft of silvery light, studded as it were with five gorgeousdiamonds of incomparable brilliance, stretching from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet.But a few minutes will suffice to give reality to this concept, bringing about a vivid realisation of thepowerful forces which, playing upon the personality, are eventually assimilated into thephychophysical system after their transformation and passage through the imaginative centres. Thecombination of rhythmic breathing with the willed visualisation of the decent of power through thelight shaft or Middle Pillar, as it is also called, produces by far the best results.Colour CorrespondencesAs skill and familiarity are acquired in the formulation of the centres, an addition to the techniquemay be made. Earlier I remarked that colour was a very important consideration where this techniquewas concerned. Each centre has a different colour attribution, though it is wisest for a long period oftime to refrain from using any other colour that white. To the Spirit or coronal centre the colourwhite is attributed. It is the colour of purity, spirit, divinity, and so on. It represents, not so much ahuman constituent, but a universal and cosmic principle overshadowing the whole of mankind. Aswe descend the shaft, however, the colours change. Lavender is attributed to the Air or throat centre,and it represents particularly the mental faculties − human consciousness as such.To the Fire centre, red is an obvious association requiring no further comment. Blue is the colourreferred to the Water centre; it is the colour of peace, calmness and tranquillity, concealing enormousstrength and virility. In other words, its peace is the peace of strength and power rather than theinertia of mere weakness. Finally, the colour referred to the lowest centre of Earth is russet, the richdeep colour of the earth itself, the foundation upon which we rest.From this very brief and concise summary it will be seen that each of these centres has a species ofaffinity or sympathy with a different spiritual constituent. One centre is peculiarly sympathetic to oris associated with the emotions and feelings, whilst another has definitely an intellectual bias. Henceit follows logically, and experience demonstrates this fact, that their equilibrated activity andstimulation evokes a sympathetic reaction from every part of man’s nature. And where diseasemanifesting in the body is directly due to some psychic maladjustment or infirmity, then the activityof the appropriate centre must be affected somehow in a deleterious way. Its stimulation by soundand colour, tends to stimulate the corresponding psychic principle and thus to disperse themaladjustment. Sooner or later a reaction is induced physically in the disappearance of the disease,and the consequent building up of new cells and tissue − the appearance of health itself.The Art of True HealingThe Earth Centre8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2.We approach a further and important stage in the development of the Middle Pillar technique.Having brought power and spiritual energy into the system by means of the psycho−spiritual centres,how best are we to use it? That is to say, use it in such a way that every single cell, every atom, andevery organ becomes stimulated and vitalised by that dynamic stream?To begin with, we throw the mind upwards to the coronal sphere again, imagining it to be in a stateof vigorous activity. That is, it revolves rapidly, absorbing spiritual energy from space about it,transforming it in such a way that it becomes available for immediate use in any human activity.Imagine then that such transformed energy flows, stream−like, down the left side of the head, downthe left side of the trunk and the left leg. While the current is descending the breath should slowly beexhaled to a convenient rhythm. With the slow inhalation of the breath, imagine that the vital currentpasses from the sole of the left foot to the right foot, and gradually ascends the right side of the body.In this way it returns to the source from which it issued, the coronal centre, the human source of allenergy and vitality, a closed electrical circuit thus being established. Naturally this circulation isvisualised as persisting within the body rather than as travelling around the periphery of the physicalshape. It is, so to say, and interior psychic circulation rather than a purely physical one.Stimulating CirculationLet this circulation, once firmly established by the mind, flow evenly to the rhythm of the breath forsome seconds so that the circuit has been traversed about half a dozen times − or even more, if youwish. Then repeat it in a slightly different direction. Visualise the vital flow as moving from thecoronal centre above the head down the front of the face and body. After having turned backwardsunder the soles of the feet, it ascends at the back in a fairly wide belt of vibrating energy. This,likewise should accompany the inhalation and exhalation of breath, and should also be persisted infor at least six complete circuits.The general effect of these two movements will be to establish in and about the physical form anovoid shape of swiftly circulating substance and power. Since the spiritual energy dealt with by thistechnique is extremely dynamic and kinetic, it radiates in every direction, spreading outwards to anappreciable distance. It is this radiation which forms, colours and informs the ovoid sphere ofsensation which is not conterminous with the shape or dimension of the physical frame. Generalperception and experience has it that the sphere of luminosity and magnetism extends outwards to adistance more or less identical with the length of the outstretched arm. And it is within this aura, aswe call it, that the physical man exists rather like a kernel within a nut. Circulating the force admittedinto the system by the former mental exercises is tantamount to charging it to a considerable degreein every department of its nature with life and energy. Naturally this is bound to exert a considerableinfluence, so far as general health is concerned, upon the enclosed ‘kernel’ within.The final method of circulation rather resembles the action of a fountain. Just as water is forced ordrawn up through a pipe until it jets up above, falling in a spray on all sides, so does the powerdirected by this last circulation. Throw the mind downwards to the Earth centre, imagining it to bethe culmination of all the others, the receptacle of power, the storehouse and terminal of he incomingvital force. The imagine that this power ascends, or is drawn or sucked upwards by the magneticattraction of the Spirit centre above the crown of the head. The power ascends the shaft and then fallsdown within the confines of the ovoid aura. When it has descended to the feet it is again gatheredtogether and concentrated in the Earthcentre preparatory to being pushed up the shaft again. As2.9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"before, the fountain circulation should accompany a definite rhythm of inhalation and exhalation. Bythese means, the healing force is distributed to every part of the body. No single atom or cell in anyorgan or limb is omitted from the influence of its healing regenerative power.The circulation completed, the mind may be permitted to dwell on the idea of the sphere of light,spiritual and healing in quality, surrounding the entire body. The visualisation should be made asvivid and as powerful as possible. The sensation, following the partial or complete formulation of theaura in the manner described, is so marked and definite as to be quite unmistakable. In the first placeit is marked by an extreme sense of calmness and vitality and poise, as though the mind was placidand still. The body, completely at rest in a state of relaxation, feels in all parts thoroughly chargedand permeated by the vibrant current of life. The skin over all the body will throw up symptoms,caused by the intensification of life within, of a gentle pricking and warmth. The eyes become clearand bright, the skin takes on a fresh healthy glow, and every faculty, mental, emotional and physical,becomes enhanced to a considerable degree.Focusing EnergyThis is the moment when, should there be any functional disturbances in any organ or limb, theattention should be directed and focused on that part. The result of this focus of attention directs aflow of energy over and above the general equilibrium just established. The diseased organ becomesbathed in a sea of light and power. Diseased tissue and diseased cells, under the stimulus of suchpower, become gradually broken down and ejected from the personal sphere. The revitalisedblood−stream is the able to send to that spot new nourishment and new life so that new tissue, fibre,cells, etc., can easily be built up. In this way, health is restored by the persistent concentration thereof the divine power. Carried on for a few days in the case of superficial ailments, and for months inthe event of chronic and severe troubles, all symptoms may successfully be banished without otherscoming to take their place. There is no suppression of symptoms. Elimination is the result of thesemethods. Even psychogenic eruptions may thus be cured. For the currents of force arise from thedeepest strata of the unconscious, where these psychoneuroses have their origin and where the lockup the nervous energy, preventing spontaneous and free expression of the psyche. The upwelling ofthe libido, as the vital force is called in psychological circles, dissolves the crystallisation’s andarmoured barriers which divide the various strata of psychic function.Where organic disease is the problem to be attacked, the procedure to be followed is slightlydifferent. (One should still be under the care of a competent physician.) In this instance aconsiderably stronger current of force is required such as will dissolve the lesion and be sufficient toset in motion those systemic and metabolic activities to construct new tissue and cellular structure.To fulfil these conditions in an ideal sense a second person may be requisite to that his vitality addedto that of the sufferer may overcome the condition. A useful technique which my experience hasdiscovered supremely successful, and which any student can adopt, is first of all to relax completelyevery tissue throughout the body before attempting the Middle Pillar technique. The patient is placedin a highly relaxed state, one in which every neuromuscular tension has been tested and called to theattention of the patient. Consciousness is then able to eliminate tension and induce a relaxed state ofthat muscle or limb. I have found a useful preliminary in the practice of spinal manipulation andmassage, with deep kneadings and effleurage, for in this way an enhanced circulation of the bloodand lymph is produced − which from the physiological point of view is half the battle won. Asuitable degree of relaxation obtained, the patient’s feet are crossed over the ankles and his fingerinterlaced to rest lightly over the solar plexus. The operator or healer the seats himself on the rightside of the person should the patient be right−handed − vice versa for a left−handed patient. Placinghis right hand gently on the solar plexus under the patient’s head, at once a form of rapport isThe Art of True HealingFocusing Energy10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"established. Within a few minutes a free circulation of magnetism and vitality is set up, readilydiscernible both by patient and healer.The patient’s attitude should be one of absolute receptivity to the incoming force − automatic, shouldhe have unwavering confidence and faith in the operator’s integrity and ability. Silence and quietshould be maintained for a short while, following which the operator silently performs the practice ofthe Middle Pillar, still maintaining his physical contact with the patient. His awakened spiritualcentres act on the patient by sympathy. A similar awakening is introduced with the patient’s sphere,and his centres eventually begin to operate and throw an equilibrated stream of energy into hissystem. Even when the operator does not vibrate the divine name audibly, the power flowing throughhis fingers sets up an activity which will surely produce some degree of healing activity within thepatient. His psycho−spiritual centres are sympathetically stirred into the active assimilation andprojection of force so that, without any conscious effort on his part, his sphere is invaded by thedivine power of healing and life.When the operator arrives at the circulation stage, he so employs his inner visualising faculty, averitable magical power indeed, that the augmented currents ofd energy flow not only through hisown sphere but through that of his patient as well. The nature of this rapport now begins to undergoa subtle change. Whereas formerly there existed close sympathy and a harmonious frame of mind,mutually held, during and after the circulation there is an actual union and interblending of the twoenergy fields. The unite to form a single continuous sphere as the interchange and transference ofvital energy proceed. Thus the operator, or his unconscious psyche or spiritual self, is able to divineexactly what potential his projected current should be, and precisely to where it should be directed.A number of these treatments incorporating the co−operation and training of the patient in the use ofmental methods should certainly go far in alleviating the original condition. Occasionally, sincefanaticism above all is to be eschewed, medical and manipulative methods may usefully becombined with the mental methods described to facilitate and hasten the cure.Although I have stressed healing of physical ills in the above, it cannot be insisted upon too stronglythat this method is suitable for application to a host of other problems. This description of techniquewill be found adequate for all other situations which may come before the student . whether it be aproblem of poverty, character development, social or marital difficulties − and in fact any otherproblem type of which one can think.Recapitulation: The PreliminariesRepetition is often invaluable both in teaching and in learning new subjects. Hence somerecapitulation of he various processes involved in the Middle Pillar practice will help to clarify someof the issues. And I should like to add a further consideration which will help to render the entiremethod more effectual, lifting it up to a higher plane of spiritual understanding and achievement.This final step will enable the student to call into operation dynamic factors within the human psychewhich will aid in the production of the desired result. The first step, as we have seen, is apsycho−physical exercise. The student must learn how to relax, how to loosen the chronic grip ofneuromuscular tensions in his body. Every involuntary tension in any group of muscles or tissues inany area of the body must be brought within the scope of his conscious awareness. Awareness is themagical key by means of which such tension may literally be melted away and dissolved. Only alittle practice is necessary for this, and skill is very readily obtained. The important conclusionfollowing upon physical relaxation is that the mind itself in all its departments and ramificationsundergoes a similar relaxation. Psychic tension and somatic inflexibility are the great barriers toThe Art of True HealingRecapitulation: The Preliminaries11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"realising the omnipresence of the body of God. They actually prevent one from becoming aware ofthe ever−presence of the life−force, the dependence of the mind upon − even its ultimate identitywith − the Universal Mind, the Collective Unconscious. The mind’s petty barriers eliminated, andlife flowing through its extensive organisation, almost immediately we become conscious of thedynamic principle pervading and permeating all things. This step is without question theall−important phase in the application of these psycho−spiritual techniques.Once having become aware of the preceding, the logical procedure is to awaken the inner spiritualcentres which can handle, as it were, this high−voltage power and transform it into a unable humanquality. Possibly the easiest way to conceive of this is to liken the spiritual part of man to a radioreceiving set. The instrument must first be started with power either from the battery or from themain before it will work. Once power is flowing through it, then the rest of the intricate mechanismof wiring, transformers, condensers, tubes and antennae are able to come into operation. So also withman. We can tune ourselves to the Infinite more readily through the mechanism of lighting up theinner centres, man’s own radio tubes. When the radio set is operative, then the divine current can beshot through the set in various ways, until both body and mind become powerfully vitalised andstrong with spiritual energy.PrayerBut all this is merely preparatory. The radio set may be lighted, the condensers and transformers andantennae in perfect operation − but what do we want to do with it? So also here. We need money.Sickness is present. Or we have undesirable moral or mental traits − or what not. We have so toelevate our minds, in the utilisation of this spiritual energy, that the desire of our heart automaticallyrealises itself with practically no effort at all. The wish, the heart’s desire, the goal to be reached,must be held firmly in mind, vitalised by divine power, but propelled forward into the universe bythe fiery intensity of all the emotional exaltation we are capable of. Prayer is therefore indispensable.Prayer, not merely as a petition to some God outside of the universe, but prayer conceived as thespiritual and emotional stimulus calculated to bring about an identification with or realisation of ourown Godhead, Prayer, sincerely, undertaken, will mobilise all the qualities of the self, and the innerfervour that it will awaken will reinforce the work previously done. It will render success an almostinfallible result. For in such a case, success not because of one’s own human effort, but because Godbrings about the result. The fervour and the emotional exaltation enable one to realise the divinitywithin, which is the spiritual factor which brings our desires to immediate and complete fulfilment.But I question whether prayer of the quite unemotional variety has any value at all here. Thiscold−blooded petitioning finds no place within the highest conceptions of spiritual achievement. Anancient metaphysician once said, ‘Inflame thyself with prayer.’ Here is the secret. We must so praythat the whole of our being becomes aflame with a spiritual intensity before which nothing can stand.All illusions and all limitations fade away utterly before this fervour. When the soul literally burnsup, the spiritual identity with God is attained. Then the heart’s desire is accomplished without effort− because God does it. The wish becomes fact − objective, phenomenal fact, for all to see.What prayers, then, should be employed to lift the mind to this intensity, to awaken the emotionalfervour of which it was said ‘inflame thyself in praying’? That I conceive to be a problem to besolved each one for himself. Every man and woman has some idea about prayer which, whensustained, will inflame him to inward realisation. Some people will use a poem that has always hadthe effect of exalting them. Others will use the Lord’s prayer, or maybe Psalm 23. And so on for allpossible types. For myself, I prefer the use of some archaic hymns known as invocations, but whichare prayers nonetheless, which certainly have the desired effect upon me of arousing the necessaryThe Art of True HealingPrayer12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"emotional potential. In the hope that these might be useful to others, I append herewith a couple offragments, the first one being composed of vesicles from various scriptures.I am the Resurrection and the Life. Whosoever believeth on me though he were dead,yet shall he live, and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall have everlasting life.I am the First, and I am the Last. I am He that liveth and was dead − but behold! I amalive for evermore, and hold the keys of hell and death. For I know that my Redeemerliveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth. I am the Way, the Truth,and the Life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. I am the Purified. I havepassed through the gates of darkness unto Light. I have fought upon earth for good. Ihave finished my work. I have entered into the invisible.I am the Sun in his rising, passed through the hour of cloud and of night. I am Amoun,the Concealed One, the opener of the day. I am Osiris Onnophris, the Justifed One,the Lord of Life, triumphant over death. There is no part of me which is not of theGods. I am the preparer of the Pathway, the Rescuer of the Pathway, the Rescuer untothe Light. Let the White Light of the Divine Spirit Descend.The second fragment is rather different from the above although both have a similar personal effectwhen slowly repeated, meditated upon and felt intensely. This second prayer consists of two parts −the first one being a sort of petition of the higher divine self, whilst the second part bespeaks of therealisation of identity with it.Thee I invoke the Bornless One. Thee that didst create the Earth and the Heavens.Thee that didst create the Night and Day. Thee that didst create the Darkness and theLight. Thou art Man−Made− Perfect, whom no man hath seen at any time. Thou artGod and very God. Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust. Thoudidst make the female and the male. Thou didst produce the seed and the fruit. Thoudidst form men to love one another and to hate one another. Thou didst produce themoist and the dry, and That which nourisheth all created things.The second half should follow only after a long pause, in which one attempts to realise just what it isthat the prayer has asserted, and that it is raising the mind to an appreciation of the hidden secretGodhead within, which is the creator of all things.This is the Lord of the Gods. This is the Lord of the Universe. This is He whom thewinds fear. This is He, who having made voice by his commandment is Lord of allthings, king, ruler and helper. Hear me and make all spirits subject unto me, so thatevery spirit of the firmament and of the ether, upon the earth and under the earth, ondry land and in the water, of whirling air, and of rushing fire, and every spell andscourge of God the Vast One may be made obedient unto me. I am He, the BornlessSpirit, having sight in the feet, strong and the immortal Fire. I am He, the Truth, I amHe who hate that evil should be wrought into the world. I am He that lighteneth andthundereth. I am He from whom is the shower of the Life of Earth. I am He whosemouth ever flameth. I am He, the begetter and manifester unto the Light. I am He, theGrace of the World. The Heart Girt with a Serpent is my Name.The prayer fragments are suggested only and are to be used or rejected as each student feels fit. Theyoperate for me − they may operate in the case of other students, or not, as the case may be.The Art of True HealingPrayer13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Non−therapeutic UsesQuite apart from therapy, there are other uses of the Middle Pillar technique as I have intimatedabove. The enterprising student will divine his own usage’s for it.may be for various reasons that certain necessities of life, either physical or spiritual, have beendenied one − with a consequent cramping effect on character and the onset of a sense of frustration.The latter always has a depressing and inhibitory effect on the human mind, producing indecision,inefficiency and inferiority. There is no real necessity why there should be any undue frustration andinhibition in our lives. A certain amount is no doubt inevitable. So long as we remain human it isquite certain that in some measure we are likely to be thwarted in our efforts fully to express theinner self, thus experiencing some degree of frustration. But any abnormal measure of persistentsense of thwarting and frustration may be dealt with and, by these mental and spiritual methodseliminated.First of all an understanding of life is essential, and an unconditional acceptance of everything in lifeand every experience that may come one’s way. With understanding will come a love of life andliving, for love and understanding are one and the same. It will also foster the determination nolonger to frustrate natural processes but by acceptance to cooperate with nature. The methods ofspiritual and mental culture have long held out hope that these inhibitory conditions may bealleviated.Poverty of estate as well as of idea is a life−condition which these techniques have alwaysacknowledged to be menable to treatment. The usual method is one of such deep and prolongedreflection upon just that mental stimulus, moral quality or material thing which is wanted, that theidea of the need sinks into the so−called subconscious mind. If the barriers leading to thesubconscious are penetrated so that the latter accepts the idea of the need, then, so it is said, sooneror later life will inevitably attract one of those things required. But, as with all therapeutic methods,there were so many instances where, despite close adherence to the prescribed techniques, successwas not forthcoming. It is my contention, therefore, that they fail for very must the same reasons thattheir healing efforts fail. In short, it was because there was no true understanding of the interiorpsychodynamic mechanism whereby such effects could be produced. There was no appreciation ofthe methods by which the dynamic nature of the unconscious could be so stimulated that the humanpersonality became transformed into a powerful magnet attracting to itself whatever it truly desiredor was necessary to welfare.Whether this procedure is morally defensible is a question I do not wish to discuss at length, though Iknow it will be raised. But the answer is brief. Whatever faculties we have are meant to be used, andused both for our own advantage and that of others. If we are in a state of constant mental friction,emotional frustration, and excessive poverty, I fail to see in what way we can be of service either toourselves or our fellow men. Eliminate these restrictions first, improve the mental and emotionalfaculties so that the spiritual nature is able to penetrate through the personality and manifest itself inpractical ways, then we are in a position to be of some service to those with whom we come intocontact. The preliminary stimulation of the psycho−spiritual centres within, and then formulatingclearly and vividly one’s demands upon the universe is capable of attracting almost anythingrequired, so long, naturally, as it exists within the bounds of reason and possibility.The Art of True HealingNon−therapeutic Uses14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Using the Astrological StructureFirst of all, let me preface my further remarks by stating that from the practical point of view therudiments of the astrological schema are of untold value in that they offer a concise classification ofthe broad divisions of things. I am not concerned here with astrology as such, merely that it isconvenient to use its schema. Its roots are in the seven principal ideas of planets to which most ideasand things may be referred. To each of these root ideas there is attributed a positive and negativecolour, and a divine name for the purpose of vibration. I propose naming the planets with theirprincipal attributions as follows:Saturn. Older people and old plans. Debts and their repayment. Agriculture, real estate, death, wills,stability, inertia. Positive colour indigo; negative black. Jehovah Elo−him, pronouncedYeh−hoh−voh Eh−loh−heem.Jupiter. Abundance, plenty, growth, expansion, generosity. Spirituality, visions, dreams, longjourneys. Bankers, creditors, debtors, gambling. Positive colour purple; negative blue. El,pronounced exactly as written.Mars. Energy, haste, anger, construction or destruction (according to application), danger, surgery.Vitality and magnetism. Will−power. Positive and negative colours bright red. Elohim Gibor,pronounced Eh−loh−heem Gibor.Sun. Superiors, employers, executives, officials. Power and success. Life, money, growth of allkinds. Illumination, imagination, mental power. Health. Positive colour orange; negative colouryellow or gold. Jehovah Eloah ve−Daas, pronounced Yeh−hoh−voh El−loh ve−dah−ahs, IAO asexplained previously.Venus. Social affairs, affections and emotions, women, younger people. All pleasures and the arts,music, beauty, extravagance, luxury, self−indulgence. Both colours emerald green. Jehovah Tzavoös,pronounced Yeh−hoh− voh Tsah−voh−ohs.Mercury. Business matters, writing, contracts, judgement and short travels. Buying, selling,bargaining.

Sense reactions. Short journeys and removals. Changes andfluctuations. The personality. The personality. Positive colour blue; negative colour puce. Shah−daiEl Chai.These very briefly are the attributions of the planets under which almost everything and everysubject in nature may be classified. This classification is extremely useful because it simplifiesenormously one’s task of physical and spiritual development. It may be best if before concluding Iinstance a few simple and elementary examples to illustrate the function and method of employingthese correspondences.Using Astrological CorrespondencesSuppose I am engaged in certain studies requiring books that are not easily obtainable frombooksellers. Despite my every demand for them, in spite of widespread advertising and willingnessThe Art of True HealingUsing the Astrological Structure15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"to pay a reasonable price for them, my efforts are unavailing. The result is that for the time mystudies are held up. This delay reaches the point when it is excessive and irritating, and I decide touse my own technical methods for ending it. At certain prescribed intervals, preferably uponawakening in the morning and before retiring to sleep at night, I practise the rhythmic breath and theMiddle Pillar. By these methods I have made available enormous quantities of spiritual power, andtransformed the unconscious into a powerful storage battery, ready to project or attract power tofulfil my need. This I circulate through the auric system.My next step consists of visualising the negative or passive colour of Mercury, orange, so thatmeditating upon it changes the surrounding uric colour to that hue. Orange is used because books,which I need, are attributed to Mercury; and I employ the negative colour because it tends to makethe sphere of sensation open, passive and receptive. Then I proceed to charge and vitalise the sphereby vibrating the divine name again and again, until it seems to my perceptions that all the mercurialforces of the universe react to the magnetic attraction of that sphere. All the forces of the universe areimagined to converge upon my sphere, attracting to me just those books, documents, critics, friendsand so on, needed to further my work. Inevitably, after persistent and concentrated work I hear fromfriends or booksellers quite by chance, so it would see, that these books are available. Introductionsare procured to the right people, and taken by and large my work is assisted. The results occur,however in a perfectly natural way.One is not to imagine that the use of these methods contravenes the known laws of nature and thatmiraculous phenomena will occur. Far from it. There is nothing in them that is supernatural. Thesemethods are based upon the use of psychic principles normally latent within man, and whicheveryone possesses. No individual is unique in this respect. And the use of these psychic principlesbrings results through quite normal but unsuspected channels.On the other hand, should I desire to help a colleague who has literary aspirations but at a certainjuncture finds his style cramped and the free flow of ideas inhibited, I should alter my method in oneparticular point only. Instead of using orange as before, I should visualise the aura as of a yellow orgolden colour, through the vibratory name would be the same. Again, instead of imagining theuniversal forces to have a centripetal motion towards my sphere, I should attempt to realise that themercurial forces awakened within me by the colour visualisation and vibration are being projectedfrom me to my patient. If he, too, becomes quite and meditative at the same hour, my help becomesmore powerful since he consciously assists my efforts with a similar meditation. But this need not beinsisted upon. For, as shown by telepathy experiments, the greater part of the receiver’s impressionsare unconsciously received. Therefore, in the case of the patient, his own unconscious psyche willpick up automatically and of necessity the inspiration and power I have telepathically forwarded tohim in absentia.This system combines telepathic suggestion with the willed communication of vital power. Istrenuously oppose those partitive apologists who uphold in theory the one faculty to the detrimentof the other. Some deny suggestion or telepathy, and argue overenthusiastically on behalf of vitalmagnetism. Others refuse categorically to admit the existence of magnetism, pressing their proofsexclusively in favour of telepathy and suggestion. Both, to my mind, are incorrect and dogmaticwhen insisting upon their idea alone as having universal validity or as being the sole logical mode ofexplanation. Equally, each is right in some respects and in certain number of cases; there is a placefor both in the natural economy of things. The resources of nature are both great and extensiveenough to admit the mutual existence of both of them, and innumerable other powers also.The Art of True HealingUsing the Astrological Structure16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Self−analysisThe technical procedure is, as I have shown, extremely simple − even where employed for subjectiveends. Suppose the realisation suddenly comes to me that instead of being the magnanimous person Ihad imagined myself to be I am really mean and stingy. Of course I could go through a course ofpsychoanalysis to discover why my nature early in life had become warped so that a habit ofmeanness was engendered. But this is a lengthy and costly business − bad arguments, admittedly,against its necessity. And so much would depend upon the analyst and his relations with myself.Instead, however, I might resort to the following technique. My first steps consist of those describedabove − rhythmic breathing, the light−shaft formulated from head to foot, and the circulation offorce through the aura. Then remembering that a generous outlook upon and an attitude towards lifeis a Jupiterian quality, I would surround myself with an azure sphere whilst vibrating frequently andpowerfully the divine name El. It depends entirely upon one’s skill and familiarity with the systemwhether the names are vibrated silently or audibly, but by either way, powerful Jupiterian currentswould permeate my being. I would even visualise every cell being bathed in an ocean of blueness;and I would attempt to imagine currents invading my sphere from every direction, so that all mythinking and feeling is literally in terms of blueness. Slowly a subtle transformation ensues. That is,it would were I really sincere, desirous of correcting my faults, and if I did attempt to becomegenerous enough as to perform the practice faithfully and often.Likewise, if a friend or patient complained of a similar vice in him, appealing to me for help, in thisinstance I would use a positive colour for projection. I would formulate my sphere as an activedynamic purple sphere, rich and royal in colour, and project its generous, healing, and fecundinfluence upon his mind and personality. With time the fault would be corrected to his satisfactionand thus enhance his spiritual nature. And so on, with everything else. The few examples will, I amsure, have shown the application of the methods.It is not enough simply to wish for certain results and idly expect them to follow. Failure only cancome from such an idle course. Anything worth while and likely to succeed requires a great deal ofwork and perseverance. The Middle Pillar technique is certainly no exception. But devotion to it isextremely worthwhile because of the nature and quality of the results which follow. Once a day willdemonstrate the efficacy of the method. Twice a day would be much better − especially if there issome illness or psychic difficulty to overcome. After a while, the student who is sincere and in whomthe spiritual nature is gradually unfolding, will apply himself to the methods quite apart from thepromise which I have here held out. Healing powers, freedom from poverty and worry, happiness −all these are eminently desirable. But over and above all of these is the desirability of knowing andexpressing the spiritual self within − though it may be in some cases that this ideal is hardlyattainable until some measure of fulfilment in other respects and on other levels has been achieved.When, however, the ideal is realised as desirable, the value of this method will also be realised assupremely effectual to that end.The Art of True HealingSelf−analysis17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Notes1.
