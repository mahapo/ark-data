Many ofthese are synthetic terms that I will use in an attempt toconvey core concepts while still trying to avoid references tospecific paradigms. When I do make specific references, thesewill hopefully only be made in order for you to see theapplicability of a concept or to help place something in aframework that youll be more comfortable with. Much of what Iwill cover is in many ways old ground, but please read on.Also, please note that nothing is true and everything ispermitted, so that if I appear to be drawing a box aroundsomething at any point, please feel free to go outside thatbox and see if what I'm saying still makes sense. This is onlya model, but one that I feel explains a lot of things.A lot of people have different views about magick, differentstyles, different methods, but if you move past dogma and feelings, you find that there are some common observationsthat can be made about much of what happens under the label ofresults oriented magick.Results and their manifestation:A successful result often comes by unexpected ways. Asuccessful result often appears to be due to synchronicities.Results due to ritual, whether successful or not, often have aspecific feel to them. Side effects, or collateral effects arenot uncommon, but ideally are minimized. Results rarelymanifest through movie magick special effects stylepyrotechnics. Results most often manifest through people,whether 3rd party, the magician, or the target of target basedmagick. Results often manifest through 3rd parties, whetherdirectly or indirectly. Results are gross scale effects andperceptible to the magician and others. Successful magiciansclaim a high rate of success. Magick doesnt seem to have ahigh success rate for certain classes of result, such aswinning at games of chance.A strong belief in magick and in your ability to work it, seem to help. Paradoxically, ultimate emotional feeling within"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/agents.html2 of 81/22/2007 6:35 PMritual, followed by totally forgetting about the result youwant after the rituals climax, seems to help. Avoiding lust ofresults seems to help.State of gnosis is the mental state from which the actual work or climax is achieved. Extraneous thoughts seem to hinder theprocess, which is one of the reasons that some people banishbefore a ritual, to clear their heads. There is obviously morethan this, but Im picking things that will let me begin to laydown a foundation for the model that I will be presenting. Fornow, Im going to focus on results and their manifestation.From the above observations on results, Im going to make thefollowing assumptions:1) Results are often not manifested directly by the magician.2) Results are usually manifested through 3rd party agents, whether directly or indirectly.3) The exact method and agents of manifestation are almost, if not always, never known ahead of time by the magician. (i.e.ritual is done with only the result in mind, not the method ofmanifestation)4) Results are gross scale manipulations of probability.The argument for an agent based model:CMT looks at what were attempting to do in terms of probabilities. Results oriented magick, in its most basicguise, is an attempt to improve our odds at getting a desiredresult. For the sake of limiting the scope of this article, Iwill focus on what could be called the anomalous manipulationof the probability of a given result.Can we as humans directly affect the probability of a given outcome in an anomalous manner? At this point I will drop downinto a paradigm, that of science. The question of Psi powersand the ability of humans to affect reality with just thepower of the mind, has been a topic of scientific research fora number of years. Though there are a number of theories as tohow this is achieved, one thing that seems to be clear fromthe numerous studies that have been done is that humans havethe ability to manipulate probabilities in an anomalousmanner. What also should be noted is that this manipulation isof a very small, but still statistically significant, size.Common sense would seem to be in line with this. There aren'ta lot of spoon benders in the various magick circles Ivetraveled. Casinos are still in business and making a goodprofit. Of course there are probably exceptions to this rule,but I personally havent met them and certainly not amongst anyof my friends who practice magick.If we dont seem to inherently have the ability to manipulateprobabilities on a gross scale, then should we look to otherparadigms for the answers? Are external entities doing the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/agents.html3 of 81/22/2007 6:35 PMwork - servitors, gods, energy beings, enochian angels? If weuse common sense and experience, then again we see problemswith other paradigms as well. Religious miracles are indeedmiraculous, and not commonplace. The Catholic Church is notwinning. Im still here despite the fact that millions ofChristians are busy praying for the demise of cartoon evil.Anomalous gross scale manipulations of probability seem to berare, without regard for who or what is the driving force. When external entities are employed, its still rare that sucha being materially manifests the magicians desire in a directway. Agents of manifestation are still used, regardless of who or what is acting in the capacity of what I call engines ofmagick. The same basic observations about results in resultsoriented magick seem to apply no matter what the paradigmused. There is variation of course, but we still see the samesorts of things.So what about magick allows us to anomalously manipulateprobabilities on a gross scale? How can we affect change on such a regular basis that more than a few magicians run aroundclaiming high rates of success and command of their universe?From the above observations it would seem that Agents are theprime source of manifestation of a magicians desired result.This is still not a big stretch. If the result isn't poppinginto existence out of thin air, then someone or something ismanifesting it, i.e. an Agent of manifestation. Were stillleft with a bit of a gap though.If direct manipulation of anything more than the slightest degree is so rare, then how is it that we can affect theagents that manifest our desired result? Through chaos.If the agents that manifest our desired results are chaotic dynamic systems, in particular, systems that ideally sit atthe edge of chaos, then we can with a slight manipulation ofstarting parameters, affect a gross scale manipulation ofprobability (the so called butterfly effect). This is not justanother model striving to incorporate the term chaos into itsdescription, but a fairly simple model that fits extremelywell with observations about results oriented magick, as wellas with current CMT.The Model: The path from the magician to his/her desired result involves what I call engines of magick, agents of manifestation andinterference. Magicians employ engines of magick in order tomaximize the manipulation of agents of manifestation. Theseagents are what directly manifest the will of the magician.All humans, entities, and things that are capable of acting inthe idealized fashion of an engine of magick, are also capableof random and low-grade manipulation of the available pool ofagents which ultimately has a negative effect upon theprobability of success. This is known as interference.Engines of magick:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/agents.html4 of 81/22/2007 6:35 PMThe role of an engine of magick is to maximize the probability of the magicians desired result, by maximizing the totalprobability function for the agents of manifestation. This isnot a flat 2d function, but is a multidimensional function. Itmust somehow know a number of things, then have enough energyto set things into motion. Such knowledge might include:1) What agents are available to manifest a result. 2) What agents can be manipulated to manifest a result.3) What starting parameters for a potential agent should bemanipulated to achieve a given result.4) How the starting parameters of a chaotic dynamic system must be manipulated in order to have the system unfold andachieve the desired result.5) What combination of agents in serial or parallel might be necessary to achieve a result.6) When such manipulation should take place. Many other involved pieces of information:This is a damn tall order. It requires an incredible level ofprescience and anomalous knowledge, though not omniscience. Luckily, as magicians we have such capabilities, or at leastin theory we do. Occult lore speaks of such knowledge withflowery terms such as Seeing with our higher self, seeing intohigher dimensions or energies, knowing, etc. A scientificparadigm might call it a mix of ESP and quantum computing. Ifwe believe in divination however, or more than just believe,have experienced it, then such anomalous knowledge andcomputing are within reason. If we believe in externalentities, then such abilities fall just as easily to them. This does not mean that it is an easy task. It requires that an engine of magick has to do some pretty amazing things, fromboth an anomalous knowledge standpoint, and a subtlemanipulation standpoint. As it is an attempt to maximize theprobability of success, it will not always succeed, it willnot always choose the best agent or agents, and it will notalways do it in a straightforward manner. It will find thebest maximization that it is capable of, using what it has atits disposal. What exactly is an engine of magick? It is anything that serves the above meta-function. It can be any number of thingsmore specifically, depending upon your paradigm. It could be asingle engine that is in fact some function of the brain ofthe magician, or it could be the multiple engines of multiplemagicians doing group ritual. It could also be some functionof an external entity (for you theists), a single syntheticengine formed by a group as an egregore or an individual as a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/agents.html5 of 81/22/2007 6:35 PMservitor, or a single engine formed by a group bysynchronizing their individual brain based engines.Agents of manifestation:The role of the agents of manifestation is to manifestresults. Potential agents are ANY system capable of manifesting a result. As the engine of magick must maximizethe end probability, certain things can be assumed about whatmakes a good agent. The agent should have a reasonable baseprobability of manifesting a required effect. A boulder inCalifornia has a low probability of getting you a job in NYC.If it is a conscious task, then the agent should not beagainst it. For agents that are sentient, there are any numberof actions that, though capable of, they would not perform because it is against their will. This should not be a problemfor nonsentient agents. The engine of magick should be able tomanipulate it effectively in order to achieve a desiredaction. Ideally, an agent is a chaotic dynamic system that sits at the edge of chaos. An overly chaotic system becomes toounpredictable and would not be an effective agent. At theextreme, a totally random system has no predictability at all.Conversely, a strictly non-chaotic system has no butterflyeffect to take advantage of, and would not amplify themanipulation as well. The amount of interference that the agent brings with it should be minimal. For human agents and others that canpotentially function as engines of magick, they should notbring excessive interference to the operation. An agent thathas strong emotional attachment to some aspect of theoperation is going to be doing his or her own subtlemanipulation to the systems involved. Agents are the systems that ultimately manifest a change in probability that gives us our result. We should notdirectly/consciously choose these agents, as that is one ofthe functions of the engine of magick.An obvious assumption is that agents must be humans. Although this is often the case (if you look closely enough at yoursuccessful results oriented work, theres almost always a humanagent manifesting the result somewhere in the mix), this isnot a requirement of this model. Agents can include one ormore systems acting in serial or parallel. This can be human,non-human, weather, pollen in the air, servitors, gods,whatever. It can also be the magician him/herself, or thetarget or targets of a working. Again, the engine of magickhas to optimize the fabric of possibility toward a desired result. Some agents optimize better than others.Interference:If we choose to use the sensitivity of chaotic dynamic systems"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/agents.html6 of 81/22/2007 6:35 PMas a method for amplifying a very small effect into somethingmuch bigger, then were also forced to deal with interferenceon this level. What is the difference between a magician andevery Tom, Dick and Harry who really wants something andsimply wishes for it? It is my belief that all humans, in factanything that is capable of acting in the idealized capacityof an engine of magick, are also capable of a very low-gradeversion of this same manipulation. Magick involves reaching astate of gnosis and then, with enhanced knowledge and ability,manipulating the starting parameters of chaotic dynamicsystems that in turn manifest the will of the magician. Even the magician can perform this same low-grade manipulation.This is the dreaded lust of results that occurs outside of ritual. This is why it is so imperative to forget your desiredresult and to banish, with laughter or otherwise, at the tailend of a ritual. Interference comes from many quarters. Theseinclude: Interference from the populace at large. Interference from other magicians. Interference from the target or targets of a ritual. Interference from the magician. Any degree of fixation or desire can potentially direct interfering manipulation at the pool of chaotic dynamicsystems that the magicians engine of magick has so carefullymanipulated and maximized toward a purpose. This samesensitivity to starting parameters that the engine of magicktakes advantage of also leaves them susceptible tointerference. An obvious question is whether or not an engineof magick would know ahead of time about future interferenceand compensate for it. This is of course a possibility, but as such interference would clearly increase the complexity ofprediction, it only makes sense that it would decrease theoverall probability of success for an operation.Does the model match observation? Manifestation through agents of manifestation that are ideally chaotic dynamic systems seems to fit observation fairly well.Manifestation often seems random and unpredictable. Thefeeling of synchronicities and coincidence also makes sensewith such a model. Side effects or collateral effect makestotal sense as the end result of interference changing thecourse of an agents intended unfolding. Certain classes ofresult would have a much smaller chance of being affectedthrough magick. Completely random events, such as the outcomeof the lottery where there is no easy way for an agent tomanipulate the system, would be an example of this. Does it play well with current CMT? I believe that it does. It helps explain a number of things in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/agents.html7 of 81/22/2007 6:35 PMmy opinion. Why a magickal link would be of help, why beliefis important, why detachment about the result outside of theritual is so important, what the purpose of the state ofgnosis is. Additional thoughts and practical application Groupritual becomes problematic unless certain things occur.Ideally there is either only one engine of magick doing themanipulation, or all engines of magick are operating in totalconcert with each other. If this is not the case, then theywill interfere with the subtle manipulation required of theagents. This could mean that there is only one operator, andthat the rest of the participants simply pump energy for theoperator, acting as the engine of magick, to use. In theory, multiple operators could somehow sync their engines of magick,and form a larger composite engine. Another possible solution is the formation of synthetic engines, or egregores. Certain results oriented work wouldseem to be a waste of time. Situations that are bereft of goodagents (chaotic dynamic systems) or that cannot be easilymanifested by agents would seem to be bad candidates for aworking. The more emotionally charged a desired result is, the more potential interference. Something without emotional contentwould be easier to do than say affecting the outcome of afootball game. Every fan in that stadium is generating somedegree of noise. It would seem that the engine of magick isable to manipulate without regard to the limits of time.Certain results are clearly manifested through agents thatwere set into motion prior to the actual ritual. Psi researchinvolving retro-PK would seem to buttress this concept. Humans are often good agents, but they are not the only chaotic systems. In theory agents can be entities (if yourparadigm includes such things), but also any chaotic systemsuch as the weather, that is subject to the butterfly effect.Something to think about and research, self organizing systems(SOSs) seem to form most readily at the edge of chaos EOC. Forthose of you who like the quantum brain model of magick, the type of maximization of agents done by the engine of magick isa good match for quantum computing.Conclusion What I've presented in this article is a stripped down version of a more complete model. I feel that although not a puremeta-model, this shortened version will give you enoughinformation so that you can apply it to whichever paradigm youfeel most comfortable with. Please note that the focus of thisarticle is on results oriented magick, and is only one of anumber of potential magicks. The logical concepts of enginesof magick and agents of manifestation, although synthetic innature, hopefully avoided some of the confusion that paradigmspecific references might have caused. Please feel free toreshape them and apply them however you feel necessary. To sumthis whole article up in one sentence:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IOTA - Welcomehttp://iota.goetia.net/Articles/agents.html8 of 81/22/2007 6:35 PMResults oriented magick most often involves reaching a state of gnosis and then, with this enhanced knowledge and ability,manipulating the starting parameters of chaotic dynamicsystems that in turn manifest the will of the magician."}]
