No other name in the Western Mystery Tradition invokes suchrespect, such mystery. The Black Land on the Nile. The place that mostpractioners of the High Arts will tell you that those same arts originated.Why this fascination with the land of Egypt? In the Modern Era, Egypthas been the source for inspirations for the occult world sinceNapoleon’s expedition there at the close of the 18th Century.There were several ancient schools of magick in Ancient Egypt.Everyone from Moses to Pythagoras was supposed to have been trainedthere in the magickal arts. Even the magnificentEmerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistos wassupposedly found, cradled on the chest ofHermes, in an Egyptian tomb by Alexander theGreat.1This diminutive text of twelve briefstatements is, along with the other Trismegisticliterature, completely compatible with theAlchemical and Hermetic Traditions.2Hermeticism, as we know, was the meeting ofthe ancient Hellenic and Egyptian cultures inthe centuries at the beginning of the CommonEra, and inspired by a god born from the merg-er of these two cultures, Hermes Trismegistos.3Throughout the first three centuries of theCommon Era Hermetic thought and philosophy was at its height.The influence of Egypt on the Western Mystery Tradition continuedthrough the various minor schools of the Kabbalah well into the 16thCentury in Egypt. There were numerous schools in Alexandria andCairo. The most famous product of these later schools of the Kabbalahwas Rabbi Isaac Luria, commonly known as the Ari (an acronym stand-ing for Elohi Rabbi Isaac, the Godly Rabbi Isaac).4It is from these laterschools of the Kabbalah that originate several of the most important sur-viving commentaries of not only Kabbalistic writing, but also theTalmud and Torah.Inspired by these great resources, in the 19th Century several groupsof European magicians and esoteric students again began to look toEgypt. There were several Fringe Masonic groups that looked more atthe Egyptian Mysteries, including the Universal Rite of Co-Masonry inFrance5and the various occult orders that sprang up in England near theclose of that century. The most well know of these orders was of coursethe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, but there was another earlierorder that had just as much influence on what would become the mod-ern Western Mystery Traditions. That order was the HermeticBrotherhood of Luxor, which helped influence the later Golden Dawnand in the United States, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). History of the OrderIt is in the occult atmosphere of 1870’s England that three men formedan influential magical order that included practical magical work. Theextremely important history of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, orLuxor6also known simply as the “H.B. of L.” had been nearly forgottenby modern occultists after the turn of the twentieth century, especially inthe wake of the “second occult revival” in the 1960s and ‘70s. This iswhen Jocelyn Godwin and others began working on their book detailingthe history of the order.7The order was very similar to the later Golden Dawn in that it had bothan Outer Order or Circle and an Inner Circle. The function of this “OuterCircle” of the H. B. of L. was to offer a correspondence course on prac-tical occultism, which set it apart from the Theosophical Society. Its cur-riculum included a number of selections from the writings of HargraveJennings and Paschal Beverly Randolph. HargraveJennings was a prominate Rosicrucian in Europewho wrote The Rosicrucians, Their Rites andMysteries, in 1870, one of he most influential bookson the Rosicrucians to have been written at that time.It is known that Jennings was initiated into aRosicrucian Order around 1860, possibly byKenneth R. H. McKenzie, a famous Mason andoccultist of the time. Randolph was free African-American sex magician and Spiritualist of the mid-19th Century. Randolph traveled throughout theUnited States lecturing on such subjects asAbolition, and as a Spiritualist. He also traveledthroughout England, Europe, and the Near East,including Egypt, studying both Hermetism and Rosicrucianism. Itappears that Hargrave Jennings initiated Randolph into the Rosicrucianswhile Randolph was in Europe. In about 1860 he originated a magickalorder known as the Brotherhood of Eulis. He later reformed the group in1874, the year before his death, as the Triplicate Order Rosicruciae,Pythianae, and Eluis.8The above quote refers to the adept Max Theon who at that time wasjust twenty-two years old, and that the disciple is presumably PeterDavidson, a Scottish philosopher. In London, Theon was the GrandMaster of the Exterior Circle of the Hermetic Order of Luxor, whileDavidson was the visible head of the Order. Max Theon, whose realname may be Louis Maximilian-Brimstien, was born in Poland in 1848.5Seal of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor“In 1870 (and not in 1884, as the Theosophists claimed), anadept of calm, of the ever-existing ancient Order of the H. B. ofL., after having received the consent of his fellow-initiates,decided to choose in Great Britain a neophyte who wouldanswer his designs. He landed in Great Britain in 1873. Therehe discovered a neophyte who satisfied his requirements and hegradually instructed him. Later, the actual neophyte receivedpermission to establish the Exterior Circle of the H. B. of L.”9"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001He traveled throughout Europe and the Middle East. It was in Cairo,Egypt that Theon became the student of Paulos Metamon, a Copticmagician that later was to influence H. P. Blavatsky. In certain circles,Theon was thought to have been the son of ‘the old Copt’. ThomasBurgoyne (aka Thomas Dalton) joined these two men in 1883 to helprun the Order. Burgoyne would later go on to write a book, Light ofEgypt, which set out the basic teachings of the Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor. These men were the heirs to the already established traditions andinfluences, which go back to the Rosicrucian-Masonic movements andideals of the 18th Century.These ideals can be seen in the Charter of the Hermetic Brotherhoodof Luxor, which echo the ideals of the earlier Rosicrucian and Masonicideals of the previous century. The charter of the Ancient and NobleOrder of H. B. of L., which was signed: “M. Theon, Grand Master protemp of the Exterior Circle,” contains high principles and importantinformation. As can be seen from the above ideals, the Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor was showing that those in the order had no only high and nobleideals, but that at least, one member had more than some passing famil-iarity with the works of such people as Thomas Vaughan, Roger Bacon,and many others whom appear to have Rosicrucian knowledge. Also,this can be seen in the various Masonic papers and rituals that have sur-vived from some of the Fringe Masonic Lodges of the late 18th and early19th Centuries. The influence on the Order of the Rosicrucians and Masons can alsobe seen in the format of the initiation rituals that were used within theOrder. They used the same basic initiatory rituals that were being usedthroughout Europe by the various “mainstream” Rosicrucian andMasonic orders of the late 18th and early 19th Centuries. These consist-ed of a grade system of degrees that had been the accepted manner ofadvancement within the lodge systems of both the Rosicrucians andMasons. Davidson and Theon used the more Continental Rosicruciangrade system as a basis for the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor’s system.We are all now familiar with this grade system, that is been made pub-lic by several sources, which include Israel Regardie, Paul Foster Case,Aleister Crowley, and others that have been, in their own right influen-tial in the modern Western Mystery Traditions. The grade system pre-\"...a parallel tradition running through the eighteenth centuryFratres Lucis and Asiatic Brethren on the one hand, andCagliostro's Egyptian Rite (androgynous) Freemasonry on theother. These fuse with primordial Egyptian traditions duringthe Napoleonic conquests in Egypt, passed on to Metamon,Theon, Levi, Randolph, Davidson and other nineteenth centu-ry luminaries, down to Papus, Reuss, Kellner and, eventually,Aleister Crowley and his successors and heirs within OTO.\"10“We recognize the eternal existence of the Great Cause ofLight, the invisible center whose vibrating soul, gloriouslyradiant, is the living breath, the vital principle of all that existsand will ever exist. It is from this divine summit that goes forththe invisible Power which binds the vast universe in an harmo-nious whole.” “We teach that from this incomprehensible center of Divinityemanate sparks of the eternal Spirit, which, after accomplish-ing their orbit, the great cycle of Necessity, constitute the soleimmortal element of the human soul. Accepting thus the uni-versal brotherhood of humanity, we reject, nevertheless, thedoctrine of universal quality.”“We have no personal preferences and no one makes progressin “the Order without having accomplished his assigned taskthereby indicating aptitude for more advanced initiation.” “Remember, we teach freely, without reservation, anyoneworthy of instruction.”“The Order devotes its energies and resources to discover andapply the hidden laws and active forces in all fields of nature,and to subjugate them to the higher will of the human soul,whose power and attributes our Order strives to develop, inorder to build up the immortal individuality so that the com-plete spirit can say I AM.” “The members engage themselves, to the best of their ability,in a life of moral purity and brotherly love, abstaining from theuse of intoxicants except for medicinal purposes, working forthe progress of all social reforms beneficial for humanity.”“Finally, the members have full freedom of thought and judg-ment. By no means may one member be disrespectful towardsmembers of other religious beliefs or impose his own convic-tions on others.” “Each member of our ancient and noble Order has to main-tain, human dignity by living as an example of purity, justiceand goodwill. No matter what the circumstances may be, onecan become a living center of goodness, radiating virtue, nobil-ity and truth.”11It was remarkable for me to learn that the eighteenthcentury Brothers of Light, and for that matter theInitiated Brothers of Asia, are direct antecedents of OTO.I have at hand some of their rituals. It is almost certainlycorrect that there are enough similarities in publiclyavailable literature to link these bodies, both directly andthrough intervening manifestations such as the Theon-Davidson H. B. of L. of the nineteenth century. Forexample, induction into the eighteenth century FratersLucis includes this from the Chief Priest to the acolyte ashe anoints him with the Sacred Chrism: “Let him thathath an ear, let him hear with what the Spirit saith untothe churches; to him that overcometh will I give to eat ofthe hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, andin the stone a new name written, which no man knowethsaving that he receiveth it.”12"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001sented was nearly identical to what would later become the one thatbecame popular in the hermetic community through the propagation ofthe grade material of the later Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn ofWoodman, Westcott, and Mathers. The major differences are that whilethe Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor does have a neophyte Initiation, itlacks the poetic nature of the Neophyte Initiation of the Golden Dawn.This is most likely due to the fact that the three founders of the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn were themselves high-ranking Masons andmembers of the Societas Rosicrucianis in Anglia. Over all these threemen had more practical experience with lodge ritual from these twogroups to draw upon than Max Theon or Peter Davidson. Also, the high-est degree, the Master appears to correspond to the Adeptus Minor gradeof the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor did have a series of initiatory cer-emonies for its members and those being the traditional Neophyte,Theoricus, Practicus, Philosophus, and Master, which corresponded tothe Adeptus Minor grade within the Rosicrucians and the later GoldenDawn. These grade initiations had a more Egyptian feel to them to cor-respond to the Outer Circle’s name, The Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor. The use of various Egyptian symbologies helped to create theillusion and mystique of Egypt. Though the Brotherhood did not have aPortal Grade that the Golden Dawn later utilized to bring the Outer andInner Orders together, it did manage to bring its members up to theMaster (Adeptus) grade.The traditional series of Masonic initiations is on a Three Degree sys-tem, these being Apprentice, Fellow-Craft, and Master. Peter Davidsonwas an experienced Mason, and seems to have chosen the name Masterfor the highest obtainable grade within the Hermetic Brotherhood fromthis well-established system of grade work. By trying to blend the twosystems, the Masonic and the Rosicrucian, Max Theon and PeterDavidson were the forerunners of the magickal Order that wouldsupercede them, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.There was much practical work within each grade of the HermeticBrotherhood that consisted of the most basic of magickal training. Thisis in the form of some astral skrying work in the later grades and somebasic divinatory work; astrology, basic alchemy, talismanic magick andKabbalah work in the lower grades. Some of the techniques are from thevarious works of Eliphas Levi on the nature of magick and the history ofmagick. Other ritual work was of a sexual nature and dealt with whatwould later be called Western Sex Magick. This sex magick work foundits basis in the works of Paschal Beverly Randolph and in a couple ofcases was taken directly from Randolph’s work, Eulis! The History ofLove: Its Wondrous Magic, Chemistry Laws, Modes, and Rational;Being the Third Revelation of Soul and Sex, also Reply to ‘Why Is ManImmortal?’ the Solution to the Darwin Problem, an Entirely New Theorywhich was published in 1874. Randolph used information that he hadpublished earlier for this later work. It is these earlier pamphlets andthen the book itself that helped both Max Theon and Peter Davidson inadding this material to the Outer Circle of the Order’s curriculum ofstudy.The Order even influenced The Theosophical Society. In 1875,Madame Blavatsky claimed to be in communication with an EgyptianLodge, called the Brotherhood of Luxor, which was composed of Adeptsor Brothers that were masters of occult lore. This was through PaulosMetamon whom had influenced Blavatsky in the 1840s. Blavatsky evengot Olcott, one of the members of the Theosophical Society to believethat the members of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor had taken himas a student. This is seen in the next quote concerning Blavatsky’sinvolvement with the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor.There is some indication that Blavatsky actually drew her inspirationof the doctrine of Masters from the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor.How much of this is line of thought is genuine and how much is slanderis unknown. Madame Blavatsky was against teaching practicaloccultism, except for the short-lived Esoteric Section of theTheosophical Society. She considered practical occultism and magick tobe too dangerous. In any event, Madame Blavatsky grew disenchantedwith the Order and accused them of swindling money from the gulliblein 1887. This is probably over her views that practical occultism was toodangerous to teach. She goes so far as to warn members of theTheosophical Society of Paschal Beverly Randolph and other love-philter sellers.14The formative years of the founding of the Ordo Templi Orientis, theO.T.O., were between 1894-1904. It was in these years that such personsas Davidson, Papus, and Theodor Reuss were acquainted. Papus, whowas also a member of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, calledDavidson, “one of the wisest of Western adepts, my Practical Master.”Davidson was Papus’ representative of the Martinist Order in theGeorgia Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor colony during the “AmericanPeriod” of the Order. Both Papus and Reuss were formally and person-ally associated at the time of the formation of the O.T.O.15It shows thatthe same people were in the same places at the same time with associa-tions with each other to aid in a continuous stream of ideals. These idealsappear to run from one secret society to the next in near seamless fash-ion. As a matter of fact, these ideals have a certain continuity that beginswith the Fratres Lucis in the late 18th Century and continue throughRandolph, Davidson, Papus, Reuss, Crowley, and his successors to theOrdo Templi Orientis. The theme of sex magick was definitely contin-7“In 1875 Mme. B. had claimed to be in communicationwith an Egyptian Lodge, called the Brotherhood ofLuxor, composed of “Adepts” or “Brothers”; Masters inmagical lore, and she also caused Olcott to believe thatone or more of these “Brothers” had accepted him as apupil, and that certain communications to him purportingto come from them, and received by the Colonel throughher, were the veritable productions of these “Adepts.”Olcott asserts that one of them once visited him in hisroom in a materialized astral form, and as proof of hisobjectivity left with him his headcovering, which theColonel retains to this day.”13"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001ued from Randolph through Crowley into the O.T.O., and the connect-ing thread is through Davidson and his Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor.Ritual Work of the Hermetic Brotherhood of LuxorThe Outer Circle relied upon a system of initiatory ceremonies thatdrew heavily on the Rosicrucian and Masonic initiations of the last partof the 18th and the early 19th Centuries. Max Theon and Peter Davidsonput a more Egyptian flare in these ceremonies. This use of Egyptiansymbolism helped to create an atmosphere that drew from the ancientland of Egypt. The name of the Order began this by using the wordLuxor, the Egyptian for the city of Thebes, the former capital of the land.The lay out of these initiation ceremonies is very near to what they aremodeled after, the initiation ceremonies of the more establishedRosicrucian and Masonic Orders in Europe.16These ceremonies do notneed to be discussed nearly as much as the personal work that the Orderwas having its members perform.The material that was used by the Outer Circle of the HermeticBrotherhood of Luxor was rather interesting. Much of this ritual workand philosophy can be seen in Thomas H. Burgoyne’s book, The Lightof Egypt, that he wrote after the breakup of the Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor. The majority of this book concerns astrology, but there are alsochapters that cover Symbolism, Alchemy (organic), Alchemy (occult),(these two are from Burgoyne), Talismans, Ceremonial Magic, MagicWands, The Tablets of Aeth, which is in three parts, and Penetralia.17Ithink that it is interesting to note that Burgoyne starts his book with sev-eral chapters devoted to astrology, which had become more popular by1900 when The Light of Egyptwas first published. This gets the studentinto studying what has become one of the basics of any magickal Ordersince that time. Included in these chapters on astrology are two ratherfascinating chapters on Astro-Theology, and Astro-Mythology. Thechapter on Astro-Theology gives subchapters on The Creation of theWorld and The Scheme of Redemption.This is an interesting way to look at the heavens and astrology as awhole, though Burgoyne does hit upon the one Great Truth in his axiom,“One truth, one life, one principle, and one word”. He also discusseshow the four great chapters of this celestial book can give insight intothe Divine nature. This is something that all magicians have been seek-ing from the beginning. Much of this can be seen in Burgoyne’s chapterof the Creation.Thomas H. Burgoyne goes on to discuss Symbolism. This is really adiscourse on “The Law of Correspondence”. The Law ofCorrespondence is how Nature uses symbolism to convey the Divinemessage to those that are willing to look and listen for it. He goes on toexplain that this law is one of the special truths that all students mustlearn, and that it is really expressed in the Hermetic axiom, “As it isbelow, so it is above; as on the earth, so in the sky.” Also, he states thatthe Solomonic Seal, the hexagram, is one of those symbols that expressthis Hermetic law.The two chapters on Alchemy, organic and occult, refer to the twoschools of thought concerning this most ancient of the Hermetic Arts.Burgoyne gives a brief history of alchemy and where the word comes8This sacred Bible is the great Astral Bible of the skies; itschapters are the twelve great signs, its pages are the innumer-able glittering constellations of the heavenly vault, and itscharacters are the personified ideals of the radiant Sun, the sil-very moon, and the shining planets, of our solar sphere.There are three different aspects of this sacred book, and ineach aspect the same characters different roles, their dress andnatural surroundings being suited to the natural play of theirsymbolical parts. In fact, the whole imagery may be likenedunto a play, or, rather, a series of plays, performed by the samecompany of artists. It may be a comedy, or it may be melodra-ma, or it may be a tragedy; but the principles behind the scenesare ever the same, and show forth the same Divine Oneness ofNature; demonstrating the eternal axiom. One truth, one life,one principle, and one word, and in their fourfold expression,is the four great chapters of the celestial book of the starryheavens.18THE CREATION OF THE WORLDThe simple story of creation begins at midnight, when theSun has reached the lowest point in the arc — Capricorn. AllNature then is in a state of coma in the Northern Hemisphere,it is winter time, solar light and heat are at their lowest ebb;and the various appearances of motion, etc., are the Sun’s pas-sage from Capricorn to Pisces, 60o, and from Pisces to Aries,30o, making 90o, or one quadrant of the circle. Then begin inreal earnest the creative powers, it is spring time. The six daysare the six signs of the northern arc, beginning with the dis-ruptive fires of Aries. Then, in their order, Taurus, Gemini,Cancer, Leo, Virgo; then Libra, the seventh day and the sev-enth sign, whose first point is opposite Aries and is the oppo-site point of the sphere, the point of equilibrium, equal dayand equal night, it is autumn. It is the sixth sign from Aries,the first creative action, and so the sixth day following thefiery force, wherein God created the bi-sexual man. SeeGenesis, 1:5- 27: “So God created man in His own image; inthe image of God created He him, male and female created Hethem.’’ It is the seventh, or day of the Lord (man), the climax ofmaterial creation and Lord of all living things, and be rests inthe blissful Garden of Eden. This seventh day and seventhsign is the concealed sacred Libra the perfect union of thesexes. Then comes the fall from Libra, through Scorpio, andbanishment from the Garden of Eden. That is the victory ofSatan, or Winter, over Summer, etc. It is useless to repeat thesame old, old story. The yearly journey of the Sun around theconstellated dial of Deity is the Astro basis of all primitivecosmology.19"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001from. Again the Egyptian roots of the word are stressed in his writing.His definition of Alchemy (organic)makes it clearly Practical Alchemy.That is the art of physically creating the Philosopher’s Stone throughphysical methods. The definition of Alchemy (occult)refers to what wenow call Spiritual or Inner Alchemy. The art of changing Lead into Goldas it refers to the soul. In other words, accomplishing the Great Work ofreuniting our Lower Soul with the Divine.The chapter on Talismans is basic reiteration of material from Levi onthe basics of what a talisman is, and how it works. Burgoyne tells the stu-dent that they must know what it is that they wish to accomplish with atalisman, what metals to use, and that there are certain sigils to place onthe correct metals.20This is the sort of work that the student must under-take to fully understand practical magick, and has been discussed atlength by such people as Agrippa, Levi, Crowley, and Regardie.Ceremonial Magic is the next important chapter that he covers for thestudent. Again, much of the material is a condensed version of the workof Levi, but there are a couple of important points. First, Burgoynequotes Bulwer Lytton, a prominate occultist of the time, “the lovingthrob of one great human heart will baffle more fiends than all the magi-cians’ lore.” He explains this though in this manner, “So it is with thesacred ritual. One single aspirational thought, clearly defined, outweighsall the priestly trappings that the world has ever seen.”21This is athought that has spread throughout the Hermetic world and the occultworld community at large, and sees much use. Burgoyne continues thisline of thought in his next chapter, which is on the Magic Wand. Hequote several sources as to what dimensions, type of wood, etc., that thewand should be made. Finally, he instructs the student to use that whichis most comfortable for him.The most important part of this remarkable book is concerning theTablets of Aeth. This part and the last chapter of the book, Penetralia,deal with some of the magick that was practiced by the HermeticBrotherhood.This is from the forward to the chapters on the Tablets of Aeth, and itis clear that Burgoyne wished to give something to his fellow membersof the now defunct Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor. He explains that theTablets of Aeth are the keys to unlock the hidden mysteries of theDivine, and that through them adepthood can be better understood. Thefirst application of these tablets is similar to the use of the tarot, andBurgoyne says as much.The rest of the chapters devoted to the Tablets of Aeth go on todescribe each of the Tablets, Twelve for the Zodiac and Ten for thePlanets. By the description of each of these Tablets, it is clear that theHermetic Brotherhood used its own tarot to do various divinations, skry-ing work, and meditation.The last part of the book is the Penetralia. This is the Veil of Isis, theSecret of the Soul, and how to pierce that Veil to get into the Mysteries.Burgoyne discusses how, now at the end of his life, he hopes to leavesomething of himself and his knowledge with the rest of the world. This book does give some insight into the various types of ritual magick that the Order practiced, both in the Outer Circle and the Inner, but it does not go into detail ofexactly how the Order utilized their ritual work. We can only guess athow their rituals were worked, but I would think that judging from theinfluences on Burgoyne, Davidson, and Max Theon, that what ritual wasworked by the Outer Circle was of a formula similar to their initiatoryceremonies with a great deal of Rosicrucian and Masonic flavor, not tomention some Egyptian motif and symbology.9Thy temple is the archOf yon unmeasured sky;Thy Sabbath the stupendous marchOf grand eternity.To my Brothers and Sisters of the Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor: GREETING — For some years it has been my desire toleave a spiritual legacy to the many devoted friends and fol-lowers who have braved so much amid present truth and errorfor my sake. In choosing the present work for such a purpose, I have hadin view the deeper spiritual needs of the soul — the propheticelement of the interior spirit, which can best exalt itselfthrough the contemplation of Nature’s arcane symbolism ofthe starry heavens — not the material expression of the glit-tering splendors of the midnight sky, but the spiritual soul-pic-tures of those blazing systems that reveal to the seeing eye theshining thrones of the Rulers — the Powers that Be.22Make a circle of the tablets, as you would with a pack ofTarot cards, beginning with No. 1, /, on the eastern horizon,and proceeding in the exact opposite order from a figure of theheavens — No. 2, 0, being on the Twelfth House, No. 3, 1,on the Eleventh, and 2on the M. C. of the figure, as in theAstro-Masonic chart, given in the second part of “The Lightof Egypt,’’ Vol. I, and so proceed with the rest of the twelvetablets of the stars. This figure will represent the potentialitiesof the macrocosm, the starry signs symbolizing the possibili-ties of things past or to be, and the rulers the active executorsthereof. Study the figure in all its aspects as such, first singly,tablet by tablet, then as a whole — the cosmos. Next, place theruler of any given tablet at the side of the Mansion, and try topenetrate its various meanings, powers and possibilities. Thenproceed the same with a trine and a square, and, last, with allthe rulers, in the order of their celestial lordship of the signs,each in his appointed place, as a whole Arcana.23My brother, we have done; and, in closing, have only to addthat, not until the speculating philosophy of earthly schoolsblends with the Science of the Spheres in the full and perfectfruition of the wisdom of the ages, will Man know and rever-ence his Creator, and, in the silent Penetralia of his inmostbeing, respond, in unison with that Angelic Anthem of Life:“We Praise Thee, O God!”24"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001ConclusionsWe can see that the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor was one of themost influential magickal orders of its time. It was one of the first tooffer a course of Practical Occultism or Magick to its members. Had theOrder not gotten into trouble in 1887, there very well might not havebeen a need for Woodman, Westcott, and Mathers to form the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn in 1888. Again, these three men, all of whomwere high-ranking Masons and members of the Rosicrucians in England,held many of the ideals that Davidson and Theon had for their HermeticBrotherhood of Luxor. Both Orders allowed women to join, somethingthat was unheard of in the late 19th Century due to the moral values ofVictorian England. The fall of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, dueto Blavatsky’s criticism in 1887, may have led other members of theTheosophical Society to want more, especially after the failure of theshort-lived Esoteric Section of that Society. Westcott, who was a mem-ber of the Theosophical Society, and who wanted practical magick,would have been one of those whom would be looking for something toreplace the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor with a “better” system ofteaching and studies. The influence of the Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn can be seen in thatboth Orders wanted a course of practical occultism for their membersand that both orders initiatory rituals and ceremonies were of a Masonictype. Both drew upon the mysterious land of Egypt for their inspirationin many of their ceremonies.Theodor Reuss and the Ordo Templi Orientis also continued some ofthe work of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, especially the practicalcourse of study in occultism and magick, and in the area of sex magick.Aleister Crowley continued this work once he became the head of theO.T.O. It also appears that he used some of the teachings of the HermeticBrotherhood in his Order the Argenteum Astrum, the A.A., in 1903.For seventeen years, 1870-1887, The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxorinfluenced many of who would become the leading voices in occultismin the late 19th Century, people like Max Theon, Peter Davidson, Papus,Madame Blavatsky, Theodor Reuss, and Aleister Crowley. These peoplein turn through those that they influenced helped to continue the work ofthe Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor through the 20th Century and to thepresent day. Much of this work is the work of the Hermetic Traditionsthat originate in that land on the river Nile known as Egypt._________________Notes1.

S. KuppermanThe Egyptian god-forms of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn(G.D.) are some of the most interesting, colorful, and most poorly doc-umented aspect of the Order’s inner teachings. While Aleister Crowleypublished the Golden Dawn’s initiation ceremonies in his occult period-ical The Equinox, nothing on the god-forms themselves was seen untilthe 1930s. Starting in 1937, Israel Regardie, an Adept of the HermesTemple of the Stella Matutina in Bristol England, published the teach-ings of the G.D. through the grade of Zelator Adeptus Minor. The teach-ings were published in four volumes through Aries Press and was enti-tled The Golden Dawn. It is now in its sixth edition, through LlewellynPublishing. In this, Regardie’s magnum opus, an explanation of the god-forms first appeared.This explanation, published with the “Z1” document called Enterer ofthe Threshold, was called The Egyptian Godforms of the NeophyteGrade. However, both Adam P. Forrest and Pat Zalewski1point out thatthere was never an official document on the godforms in the order.Forrest states that the paper published by Regardie was written by some-one in the Stella Matutina.2While this may be true, the god-formdescriptions published by Zalewski in his Golden Dawn Rituals andCommentaries, which almost exactly duplicate those published byRegardie, are said to be taken from a copy of a set of papers written byWilliam Wynn Westcott, who was one of the three founders of theGolden Dawn.Besides these few historical documents there have been only a hand-ful of papers on the god-forms by modern Golden Dawn scholars. All ofthese papers deal primarily with the appearance of the god-forms. Onlyone writer, Pat Zalewski in the second volume of his Golden DawnRituals and Commentaries, deals with how the energies of the god-forms are used by G.D. Magicians. One thing is missing from all of theseaccounts; there is no accounting of the mythology developed by the cre-ators of the Golden Dawn and how or why it is different from the mythsof Ancient Egypt, from which they were derived.This paper will discuss the god-forms of the visible stations, which arethose stations which are directly related to a G.D. office in the Hall of theNeophyte; the first grade of the Golden Dawn. Each god-form will beexamined and the G.D. mythology surrounding the god-form will be dis-cussed. The Ancient Egyptian god from which the god-form is derivedfrom will also be discussed, as well as any discrepancies between thetwo. The color symbolism used by the Order in each god-form will alsobe accounted for. Finally, the mythological current designed into theGolden Dawn’s Neophyte Hall, and how it ties the rest of the G.D.mythos together, will be examined.The Visible StationsOusiri3The G.D.’s Hall of the Neophyte is ruled over by Ousiri,4through theoffice of the Hierophant. The G.D. Ousiri5is the “Expounder of theSacred Mysteries”.6He sits upon the dais in the East, showing him to bea solar deity, in the place of the rising sun.Ousiri, appearing explicitly in both the Neophyte Hall as well as in partof the Portal ceremony, represents to both the Outer Order and the Portalthe Inner Order or Rosicrucian current of magical energy.7In his classi-cal appearance, published first by Regardie and more recently by PatZalewski, Ousiri holds, and is crossed with, symbols of the secondOrder.8Besides representing the Inner Order, Ousiri is a solar god-form. Hesits upon the white throne of spirit in the East on the path of Samekh9before the part of the Neophyte Hall that represents Tiphareth.10Fromhere Ousiri rules over the Neophyte Hall which represents, amongstother things, the four classical elements. This is shown in Forrest’s rep-resentation of Ousiri. Here Ousiri wears a pectoral collar of the four ele-ments. Unlike in Regardie and Zalewski’s descriptions, this form ofOusiri places the color of spirit over the elements. Ousiri’s nature asspirit ruling over the elements is also made explicit in the G.D. “OsirisPrayer”:With the exception of the Rosicrucian symbolism, which is based upontraditional Ancient Egyptian motifs, the G.D. Ousiri partakes of much ofthe symbolism of the Ancient Egyptian god, Ausir, from which he is13For Osiris on-Nophiris who is found perfect before the Gods,hath said:These are the Elements of my Body, Perfected through Suffering, Glorified through Trial.For the scent of the Dying Rose is as the repressed sigh of my suffering:And the flame-red Fire as the Energy of Undaunted Will.And the Cup of Wine is pouring out the Blood of my Heart:Sacrificed unto Regeneration, unto the Newer Life:Which I destroy in order that they may be renewed.For I am Osiris Triumphant, even Osiris on-Nophris, the Justified:I am He who is clothed with the Body of Flesh,Yet in whom is the Spirit of the Great Gods:I am the Lord of Life, triumphant over Death.He who partaketh with me shall rise with me:I am manifestor in Matter of Those whose Abode is in the Invisible:I am purified, I stand upon the Universe:I am its reconciler with the Eternal Gods:I am the Perfector of Matter:And without me, the Universe is not.11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001derived. It was believed by many early scholars of Egyptian religion,such as A.E. Wallace Budge and renowned mythologist Sir JamesGeorge Frazer that Ausir originated as a corn or grain deity.12The storyof sacrifice from which this comes eventually evolved into Ausir’s deathand regeneration story, and Ausir became Lord of the Underworld andfinally took on the aspects of many other Ancient Egyptian gods.13S. L. MacGregor Mathers, one of the G.D.’s founders, formed thesemythologies into Ousiri, who instead of a god of corn is a god of the ele-ments, an earth god. His cycle of death and resurrection, as well asAusir’s eventual taking over of the role of gods such as Rê,14led Ousirito become a representative of the solar current, upon which the G.D. andthe R.R. et A.C. were based. The story of resurrection was incorporatedinto Ousiri by making him a god of spirit and having him participate inthe same Tipharetic current as the Christos does in the Portal andAdeptus Minor ceremonies.15HoorFar across the hall from the throne of Ousiri in the East, in the placesymbolic of the greatest darkness, is enthroned Hoor, empowering theoffice of Hiereus. Hoor, the Coptic name of Horus (the younger) or Herurepresents the guardian force, protecting the Hall. Hoor guards not onlythe interior of the physical Hall, though the Hiereus’ duties do includethis, but also protects the Hall on the astral plane. This is shown in hisgod-form, as he is shown stamping down on a red serpent,16symbolicof the Qlippoth or the demons of the qabalah.The G.D. Hoor is cloaked and surrounded by darkness. This is notbecause Hoor is in any way evil or part of that symbolic darkness.Instead he stands in the West, the darkest section of Malkuth, which isconnected to the realm of the Qlippoth, to seal the Hall from any incur-sions from that area. This function is performed with the Banner of theWest, which partakes of pure Golden Dawn symbolism, and the “Swordof Judgment”,17which is also called the “Sword of Vengeance”.18This may remind us of Heru’s title of “Avenger of His Father” from Egyptian mythology.The color symbolism surrounding Hoor in Regardie and Zalewksi givehim the qualities of avenging flame. In his hands he holds a blue ankhand an emerald phoenix wand19which shows Hoor receiving energyfrom the masculine pillar of the Tree of Life. This is balanced throughthe Hiereus’ sword, which receives energy from the feminine pillar.20In this manner the god-form and office partake of balanced energy,receiving an influx of energy from both Geburah and Gedulah, Severity and Mercy.The colors in the Forrest article differs greatly from those of Regardieand Zalewski. Forrest describes Hoor not in the flashing colors of fire,but with the combined colors of darkness and fire. This symbolismshows both the Geburic and earthly energies that converge in Hoor.Hoor also bares a red sword or spear21showing that he is directing theGeburic energy into Malkuth as necessary.All G.D. descriptions of Hoor have him wearing the double crown ofupper and lower Egypt. This comes from traditional Egyptian mytholo-gy. Overall, the symbolism of Hoor reflects the Egyptian myths sur-rounding Heru as the “Avenger of his Father”22and his contentions withhis uncle Sutekh, or Set. While the focus is on traditional Egyptianmythology, the symbolism is almost entirely G.D. in nature.Thmê23Between the Pillars of Solomon and of Hermes, west of the Hierophantand East of the altar is Thmê.24Thmê, called by the Egyptians Mêêt(Maat), corresponds to the G.D. office of Hegemon.Thmê stands in balance between the pillars of severity and mercy andrepresents the balancing point between the energies of the Hierophantand the Hiereus. Thmê not only balances light and darkness but also bal-ances the currents of fire and water. The currents of fire and water arerepented by the god-forms Thaum-Êsh-Nêith and Auramoouth, who arethemselves aspects of Thmê.The symbolism relating to balance, so important to the goddess of the“Hall of Two Truths,” or the “Hall of Maat,”25is continued in theappearance of her god-form. Unlike the previous two god-forms, onlythe description given in Forrest truly continues the symbolism of bal-ance. The descriptions given in Regardie and Zalewksi correspondlargely to the Justice card of the tarot.26While this card relates to Libraand therefore balance, it does not have continuity with the symbolism ofthe other god-forms.Thmê is dressed in yellow and wears the traditional Feather of Mêêton her yellow and violet nymess. Her arm and ankle bands are alterna-tively yellow and red or yellow and blue. These colors are elemental innature. She primarily wears the flashing colors of elemental air. On herarms and legs are the colors of fire and water, always balanced with air.This corresponds with the G.D.’s teachings about these three primaryelements. The imagery is played out in full with the addition of Thaum-Êsh-Nêith representing elemental fire and Auramoouth who representselemental water. These two god-forms are balanced in symbolism and inthe Hall of the Neophyte by Thmê and the Hegemon.As a goddess of balance, Thmê partakes of some of the mythology ofMêêt. Most importantly, Thmê, and the office of Hegemon in general,represent the concept of Mêêt, Truth. This concept was pervasive in allaspects of Ancient Egyptian life. Simply, Mêêt was the way of right liv-ing.27This is seen especially in the “Negative Confession” which isgiven by the dead in the Hall of Mêêti, the Hall of Two Truths, to show that he or she has not sinned.28Thmê, as representative of the “illuminated way”,29especially corresponds to this aspect ofMêêt’s symbolism.In addition to the three Chief Officers of the Hall there are four lesserofficers, each with a corresponding god-form. The functions of the less-er offices and the functions of their god-forms become more and moresimilar.14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001Anoup empeIbetStationed in the South West of the Hall is the Kerux.30The god-formof the Kerux is Anoup empeIbet31, or Anubis of the East.It is Anoup empeIbet’s task to lead the candidate in the Neophyte Hallfrom darkness to light.32In this Anoup empeIbet corresponds with hisAncient Egyptian counterpart Anpu, who acts as guardian of the deadand psychopomp.33Anoup empeIbet, as psychopomp, leads the candi-date around the Hall, holding the Lamp of Hidden Knowledge, whichcontains the Light of the Divine within it. As he guards he also protectsthe candidate, making sure that his charge is properly prepared to entereach part of the Hall, which represents the Hall of Judgment from theEgyptian book of Coming Forth by Day.The appearance of this god-form is similar in both theRegardie/Zalewski and Forrest descriptions. The central image is fromEgyptian sources and depicts a man with a black jackal’s head. AnoupempeIbet is then colored primarily in yellow and violet, which are thecolors of elemental Air and the qabalistic Sephirah of Yesod.34TheRegardie/Zalewski descriptions give Anoup empeIbet the phoenix wandand ankh, symbols common to Egyptian gods. The Forrest descriptiongives him the caduceus wand and Lamp, the implements held by theofficer in the Kerux position. This shows the strong link between theduties of the office and its god-form.Auramoouth and Thaum-Êsh-NêithThe next two offices, and their corresponding god-forms, act in tan-dem, one will never move without the other. The Stolistês, and her god-form Auramoouth,35sits in the North of the Hall. Her sister office, theDadouchos, and her god-form Thaum-Êsh-Nêith36 are in the South ofthe Hall. These two stations form a cross bar with the altar in the centerof the Hall and complete a cross with the line formed by the ChiefOfficers down the center of the Hall. Of the floor officers, only theKerux and his god-form is outside of this cross of energy.Auramoouth, like the Stolistes, purifies the Hall, its officers, and theCandidate with lustral water. She is the “Goddess of the Scale ofBalance at the Black Pillar” and “the Light Shining through the Watersof the Earth”.37These titles allude to both her being a form of Thmê andher position and responsibilities within the Hall.The classical descriptions and the Forrest description of this god-formagree on color but not accoutrements. Auramoouth’s primary color isblue, color of elemental Water, which is then contrasted with orange, itscompliment. In the Regardie/Zalewski description, Auramoouth wears avulture crown, which is traditional for her Egyptian counterpart Mut.On this she wears the crown of Lower Egypt in blue. She holds, likemany of the other god-forms, a lotus wand and an ankh. Forrest depictsher holding the blue cup of lustral water.Opposite to Auramoouth, in both position and function, is Thaum-Êsh-Nêith. Where Auramoouth purifies with water, Thaum-Êsh-Nêith conse-crates with holy fire.Thaum-Êsh-Nêith complements Auramoouth completely. She wearsred and green and the crown of Upper Egypt. In her hands are either thelotus wand and ankh or the censor of incense of the Dadouchos.At first there appears to be no relation between the role of these god-forms and their historical equivalents. There are, however, slight con-nections. The vulture headed goddess Mut was considered a mother god-dess by Ancient Egyptians.38Auramoouth’s function, while not mother-ly, does relate. Her symbol, the cup of lustral water is representative ofthe womb and its life-giving waters. Neith, opposite number of Thaum-Êsh-Nêith, is amongst other things a goddess of hunting and war, bothof can be seen as fiery actions. More importantly Neith was at one pointconsidered the mother of the sun.39Anoup emp EmenetThe last of the lesser offices is that of the Sentinel.40The Sentinel andhis god-form Anoup emp Emenet41are stationed in the outside of theHall. The role of the Sentinel, much like that of the Masonic Tyler uponwhich it is based, is to guard the Hall and to prepare the candidate forinitiation. Anoup emp Emenet has the additional duty of protecting thecandidate from astral attack from the “Dog-faced Demons,” theopposers of Anubis.42This was considered necessary because the prepa-ration of the candidate places him or her in a state of magical or spiritual darkness and vulnerability.Anoup emp Emenet’s appearance is similar to that of Anoup empeIbet;except that Anoup emp Emenet is colored black and white, symbolic ofhis placement outside of the Hall. He is shown holding either symbolsof Egyptian godhood or the red sword of the Sentinel.While a great deal had been written concerning the major Egyptiandeities, the opposite is true for some of the then lesser known deities.This can be seen in the case of Mut and Neith and it is even more evi-dent in Opowet, upon whom Anoup emp Emenet was based. The mostnoticeable difference between Opowet and Anoup emp Emenet is thatOpowet was not a form of Anpu but a deity in his own right. It is likelythat the scholarship of the late 19thcentury had not had access to thosemyths and hymns that show Opowet before Anpu absorbed his func-tions. Opowet’s coloring is also different as his jackal head is oftendepicted gray or brown and Greek sources say that his head was that ofa wolf, not a jackal.43There are aspects of Anoup emp Emenet that do correspond to Opowet(and to Anpu, who took Opowet’s titles and functions). Primary amongstthese is the title “Opener of the Ways.” Whatever the original context ofthis title it neatly fits Anoup emp Emenet duty in the antechamber of theHall, that of the guardian of the entrance.It is the combined pair of Sentinel/Anoup emp Emenet, the magicianand the god-form, that admit initiates into the Hall. It is also their func-tion to prevent, both physically and magically, others from entering theTemple who have no right to be there. Thus, Anoup emp Emenet is the“Opener of the Way” into the Hall of Mêêt.15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001The Hall of the NeophyteThe visible stations of the Neophyte Hall44are but one part of GoldenDawn magic that takes on a mythic aspect. In total there are 65 god-forms in the Hall.45Most of these have no physical counterpart but stillhave an important magical role. In combination with the god-forms, theHall itself is of vast import. The Hall of the Neophyte is not only referredto as the Hall of Mêêt but actually functions as, and has the magicalappearance of, the Hall of Two Truths, especially as shown in the 17thand 125thchapters of the Egyptian book of Coming Forth by Day,46within the framework of Golden Dawn. magical practice.Guided by Anoup empeIbet, the candidate is brought, after passingvarious guardians of the Hall, to the throne of Ousiri in the East. Also inthe East, upon the dais, are the god-forms of Ese and Nebethô, Isis andNephthys.47These goddesses are shown as standing behind Ausir in theAncient Egyptian funeral texts, with the four Sons of Horus, who arealso present in the Hall.The Candidate, who represents the soul of the dead in the funeral texts,is brought to the altar, which is symbolically the Scales of Mêêt, wherethe heart is weighed against Mêêt’s feather. Just to the East of the altaris located the invisible station of the evil triad, Ouammoout peSatanas,who is the Devourer of Souls. In the book of Coming Forth by Day, if asoul’s heart weighs more than the feather of Mêêt, then he or she isthrown to the Devourer of Souls. This all takes place in the presence ofThôouth, Thoth or Djehuti, who is upon the dais at the station of theCancellarius. This is the Temple Chief who keeps the records of the Hall,even as Djehuti records the outcome of the weighing of the heart.The visible stations of the Hall of the Neophyte are a rich combinationof Egyptian mythology, qabalistic symbolism, and masterful syncreti-cism. Their roles and appearances are tailored to the needs of GoldenDawn symbolism and occultism. At the same time they are still recog-nizable as Egyptian gods and goddess. There are cases where either formagical purposes or because of lacking information some departurefrom the original mythologies are made, but this was never done arbi-trarily. These god-forms were coupled with ritual to turn the NeophyteHall into a magical model of the Ancient Egyptian Hall of Two Truths,as depicted in the book of Coming Forth by Day, thus making theNeophyte Hall and ritual a complete synthesis of Egyptian, qabalistic,and hermetic thought.____________________Notes1. “Godforms of the Visible Stations”, p. 6 and Golden Dawn Rituals andCommentaries, Vol 1, p. 154.2.

Although the exoteric world mainly remembershim as the leading Mathematician and Intellect of his generation, hismagical credentials were impeccable. He was an expert in Astrology,and in Hermetic and Neo-platonic philosophy. His writings show anaffirmed grasp of Alchemy, and show that he was aware that it was somuch more than the mere transmutation of metals. Most importantly hewas responsible, through his crystal-gazing experiments, for giving theworld the fascinating subject of “Enochian Magic,” still studied byoccultists today.1I first became interested in Dee through my study of Enochian Magic.In the occult tradition of orders like the Golden Dawn, there is somedetail about what Enochian Magic is, comparatively little about what itactually does, and even less about the circumstances in which it firstappeared in the modern world. Least of all is known about the life of theman who first made it appear. This is a shame, because Dee is importantto study as an example of a successful magician, and understanding himand his background helps us understand the legacy which he left us.To understand Dee’s influence on the Western Mystery Tradition, it isnot enough to just know what he did: one must also understand hisactions in the context of his life, and the times in which Dee lived. Anexamination of Dee’s contributions reveals that he was influenced by hiswide literacy; by his background as an intellectual generally, and a math-ematician in particular; by the modes of thought which were peculiar tothat period of history, including Hermetic philosophy and deductive rea-soning; and by the political situation then occurring in sixteenth centuryEurope.This article is not merely a retelling of the life of Dee: it is an analy-sis of how important his works are to followers of the Western MysteryTradition throughout the ages, including to the present day. By present-ing the significance in which he is held even by modern day occultists,I shall attempt to prove that Dee really does deserve the epithet of a“famous figure in the Western Mystery Tradition.”Birth, Education, Early CareerDee was born in 1527 - the son of a civil servant at King Henry VIII’scourt. He was educated at London and Chelmsford before attending StJohn’s College, Cambridge University, in 1542 at the age of 15, the typ-ical age for a freshman in those days.Constitutional upheaval gripped England throughout Dee’s lifetime. In1534, King Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church.The position of Dee’s father as a civil servant would have forced him toswear allegiance to Henry as head of the Church of England - Dee him-self would have had to take this same oath at the age of 21. We mustassume he did, for had he not he would have debarred himself from acareer in public life, and laid himself open to charges of treason. Theconflict between the Roman and the new Anglican Church would formthe background to several key events in Dee’s later life.Dee’s life as an intellectual really began at Cambridge - yet the cur-riculum at the University differed ultimately from the path that he even-tually took. For example, many of Dee’s writings display a typicallyHermetic outlook on life: with the macrocosm subtly related to themicrocosm and Man as the natural reflection of the Supernal deity. Andyet, Dee could not have learnt Hermeticism in the University, which pre-ferred the more humanistic philosophy of Aristotle. This has led onewriter to speculate that Dee came into contact with Hermetic philoso-phers at Cambridge quite apart from his studies.2However, Dee’s “official” subjects of study would have includedgrammar, logic and rhetoric; as well as music, and the three philosophies- Moral, Natural and Divine. But most interestingly, for us, at any rate,he would have studied Mathematics.The time of the Renaissance viewed Mathematics differently to now.It included not only arithmetic and geometry, but also Astronomy.Moreover, before the acceptance of the pioneering work by Gallileo andNewton, the study of Astronomy also comprised that of Astrology. Weknow that Dee mastered both geometry and Astrology, by his“Mathematicall Preface” to Euclid, and by the work which would gainhim notoriety in the reign of Queen Mary, and acceptance with QueenElizabeth.We must also assume that Dee studied Greek, as Trinity College madehim “Under Reader” in the subject after he received his BA in 1546. Wealso know of Dee’s fluency in Latin, which he probably learnt at eitherChelmsford or London, and Hebrew.3From this point until 1553 Dee experienced an uninterrupted period ofgrowing professional success. In 1548 he received his MA and took upa position at Louvain University in Belgium to lecture on Mathematics.In two years, still in his early twenties, he established himself as an inter-national authority, so that when he came to Paris to lecture on Euclid in1550, Dee started to receive offers of patronage from noblemen andeven monarchs across Europe. However, Dee turned these all down: hehad set his sights on a career back in England.In 1551 he realised his ambition when, returning to England, he metthe boy King, Edward VI. Dee obviously impressed the King, as hereceived an annuity from him. Dee also received offers of patronagefrom powerful noblemen, including the Earl of Pembroke and the Dukeof Northumberland - who engaged him as tutor for his children.Northumberland explained that he wanted them to have “the best scien-tific education in England.”Thus, by the age of 26 in 1553, Dee had successfully established bothhis international reputation and his career.“Conjuring Divils”I have already mentioned that Constitutional upheaval gripped Englandduring his lifetime. Because Dee had been determined to find a positionat the English Court, he found himself right in the middle of it. In 1553,19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001King Edward VI died, and England was fiercely divided betweenCatholic and Protestants. The Anglicans (i.e. Protestants) dominatedunder Edward VI. However, the next in line to the throne, Mary, was aCatholic, who would almost certainly try to undo all the Anglicans haddone. Therefore, a number of noblemen hatched a plan to put a youngnoblewoman called Lady Jane Grey on the throne.The plan failed. Mary, with an army, deposed Lady Jane Grey after justnine days. She then went about arresting and executing all the noblemenwho had supported Jane, including the Duke of Northumberland, Dee’spatron.Dee therefore found himself in a dangerous position. The supportersof Queen Mary at Court regarded him with suspicion. To make mattersworse, during the time 1553 - 1555 Dee did work for, amongst others,Princess Elizabeth - Mary’s half-sister and rival.In 1555 Dee cast horoscopes for Princess Elizabeth, the Queen, andthe Queen’s husband. As we have already mentioned, Mathematics atthe time, and therefore Dee’s expertise, included the study of Astrology.His enemies took this as their chance: they had Dee arrested for Treason,and accused him of “Conjuring Divils”.To understand Dee’s predicament, one should realise that the TreasonAct prohibited, and in fact it still does, “compassing the death of the sov-ereign”. Henry VIII deliberately misinterpreted this clause so that itwould mean “thinking about or mentioning the king’s death” - instead ofthe more natural meaning of “plotting or conspiring”. Thus, he had anumber of his enemies executed, because they had allegedly mentionedthat the King might pass away for whatever reason - even if it was justold age. Henry even executed his own very loyal doctor, because he mis-takenly gave the wrong prognosis! Dee’s enemies therefore argued thatDee had, by casting her horoscope, predicted Mary’s death - they hopedthe same thing would happen to him as to the enemies of King Henry.However, they had not reckoned with Dee’s intellect and eloquenttongue. During three months in 1555 - first the Star Chamber4, and thenthe Bishop of London interrogated him. Dee obviously impressed themwith his sincerity, as they eventually released him. Dee even managed toremain on friendly terms with the Bishop after his release. However, thecase attracted a lot of publicity, and left Dee with an air of notoriety thatlingered around him from that point on.The question arises: despite the fact that he convinced the authoritiesotherwise, might Dee have practised any kind of ritual magic or evoca-tion around that time? It is certainly likely. The main clue comes fromhis time at Paris in 1550 - Dee’s theories on Mathematics were stronglyflavoured by what is known as “Mathesis”. This was a kind of mysticalapproach to Mathematics. Numbers were seen as the basic language inthe mind of God. Therefore Mathesis involved understanding the equa-tions which governed the universe. An example: imagine a number isconnected with something of mystical or religious significance, e.g.Christ chose 12 Apostles. From the Mathetic point of view one wouldsay that where the number 12 occurred elsewhere in nature this pointedto another manifestation of the same force, e.g. God choosing 12 con-stellations to form the Zodiac.Gematria, and its associated numerological practices, are thus primeexamples of Mathesis which are in use by modern occult movements,e.g. the Golden Dawn.One writer has suggested that Dee’s lectures at Paris not only demon-strate a grasp of Mathesis generally, but the Mathematical theories ofHenry Cornelius Agrippa specifically.5Agrippa devotes a sizeable por-tion of the second book of his “Three Books on Occult Philosophy” tothe magical properties of numbers. Agrippa’s work contains a lot ofQabalistic theory, which the modern occultist would recognise fromsuch works as Crowley’s “777” and “Sepher Sephiroth”.6Agrippa’s book also describes ritual magic practices, albeit in a gener-al fashion, unlike the more explicit directions of the apocryphal “FourthBook of Occult Philosophy”. Nevertheless, it does constitute a large ref-erence work for someone embarking on ceremonial magic. If Dee didderive his Mathetic theories from Agrippa, this would imply that alreadyby his twenties he pursued an active interest in the Occult, which mightextend beyond merely using “Three Books on Occult Philosophy” tospice up a Maths lecture. We know that Dee certainly had read Agrippaby the time he conducted his (in)famous Angel Magic experiments in the1580s.7The Elizabethan EraThe death of Mary and the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 saw Deereturn from “out of the cold” of the past five years. Queen Elizabethlooked favourably upon Dee: she began by setting the date of her coro-nation according to a horoscope he cast.In this year, Dee himself published “Propaedeumata Aphoristica” - aset of aphorisms setting out Dee’s view of cosmology, astrology, and theroles of science and natural magic. This book clearly shows Dee as aHermetic philosopher - with its vision of the macrocosm linked to themicrocosm by rays of divine influence proceeding from the cosmos.During Elizabeth I’s reign, Dee became fêted by the court. The Queenoften relied on Dee, once asking him to explain the secrets of Alchemyto her. Dee often found himself called upon by the noblemen. The Queenseveral times promised incomes to Dee, but most of these failed to mate-rialise.One of Dee’s most remarkable achievements was the establishment ofthe largest and best library in England, at his own house in Mortlake,Oxfordshire. Dee spent most of the years 1560 - 1570 collecting largenumbers of books and manuscripts. He even travelled through conti-nental Europe between 1562 and 1565 looking for rare works.The nature of the contents of Dee’s book collection sheds some fasci-nating light on his character. They included works on all the Sciences,Hermetic philosophy, Alchemy (including works by Raymond Lully,Albertus Magnus et al.), classical Roman poetry, Neoplatonism, andmuch more besides. Dee also seems to have been acquainted with a largenumber of printed books, which he never listed as being in his library.For example, Dee seems to have had a collection of writings ondemonology and witch-craft. He also had the works of Henry CorneliusAgrippa; not only his “Three Books On Occult Philosophy”, but also20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001“On the Nobility and Excellence of the Female Sex”.8In 1562 Dee procured a rare copy of Trithemius’ Steganographia, atthis time only a hand-written manuscript. It only first came into print in1606. This book apparently contains a system of Angel magic, andmethods to conjure spirits to allow the magician to know what occurs invarious parts of the Earth as if by telepathy. Steganographia also con-tains, and conceals, a system of cryptography, which Trithemius pur-ports was the method used by the ancient Greek philosophers to concealtheir magical secrets from the profane. Dee by his own admission foundhimself very impressed with his find.Dee published very little of his own work, preferring to impart histeachings in private. Perhaps this air of secrecy fuelled the unpleasantrumours which continued to hang round him. However, he did publishtwo notable works - A “Mathematicall Preface” to Euclid’s Elements ofGeometry in 1570 and “Monas Hieroglyphica in 1564. The“Mathematicall Preface” demonstrates Dee’s views on Mathesis, whichI have already mentioned in the context of “Conjuring Divils” above.The Preface amounts to a synthesis of mystical thought from Agrippaback to the number theory of Pythagoras.The “Monas Hieroglyphica” (i.e. “Hieroglyphic Monad”) appears tobe a more obfuse document, but in terms of modern occultism this bookonly just falls behind “Enochian Magic” as Dee’s most influential work.The Monas Hieroglyphica at first sight contains a number of theoremsrelating to arbitrary exercises involving a symbol: the ancient alchemi-cal sign for Mercury. Dee’s approach appears rather oblique, but he man-ages to write a considerable amount of practical advice relating toAlchemy and the Qabalah - and indeed, some Mathetic speculations.Dee writes a particularly interesting passage, in relation to the geo-metrical figure of a cross:It appears that Dee prefigures the Golden Dawn teaching on LVX. Weknow that the founders of the Golden Dawn used Dee’s Enochian mate-rial, so could they also have looked at Dee’s other work, including“Monas Hieroglyphica”? But before we say “Yes” straightaway, weshould also consider that Kenneth Mackenzie stated, some years prior tothe Golden Dawn’s creation, that “Rosicrucians believe that Light is thePhilosophers’ Stone”9. However, Dee lived during the time thatChristian Rosencreutz supposedly lay in his tomb! Mackenzie’s remarktherefore implies that the study of Dee’s work had already establisheditself in Rosicrucian circles long before the Golden Dawn came intoexistence. It also implies that either Rosicrucians adopted Dee’s work, oreven that the Invisible Brotherhood included Dee in their fraternity!Mackenzie, as a member of the Societas Rosicrucianis In Anglia, anda keen founder of quasi-Masonic esoteric fraternities10, remains one ofthe most likely candidates to have penned the Golden Dawn CipherManuscripts - which happen to contain Enochian words of power.11The Duke of CanadaAside from Dee’s activities as a bibliophile, he actively concernedhimself with Navigation. As the foremost Mathematician, Astronomer,and intellect in the land, Dee established himself as the natural choicefor advice for explorers wishing to go on long journeys. Much of theplanet during the sixteenth century lay yet to be discovered, and Deehimself shared the fascination of these explorers. During this time, Deepublished a treatise on navigation, which became the standard text forBritish seamen.12Dee also conceived the idea that with the growth of exploration, andthe increasing efficiency of ships to survive Trans-oceanic voyages,Britain could become a world power. Dee predicted the rise of theBritish Empire; not a particularly prophetic act, as all the other countriesof Europe, especially Spain and France, wanted new colonies in the NewWorld as well. Dee later urged Elizabeth I to take the opportunity, whichwas now presenting itself.13However, Dee did not do this just out of patriotism, as he himselfhoped to benefit financially from the new rise in world exploration. Forexample, Dee signed a contract with an explorer, whereby, in return forDee’s advice and instructions on Navigation, all land that the explorerdiscovered in the new world above 51º Latitude would become Dee’sproperty. As it happened, the explorer failed to reach his destination, dueto bad weather. Had he succeeded, however, Dee would have becomethe owner of most of Canada. The realms of possibility could evenextend to Dee’s elevation into the nobility as would have befitted a pow-erful land-owner of the time, perhaps even as a Duke.Angels and DemonsWe now turn to the part of Dee’s life which holds the most fascinationfor modern students of the occult; his association with Edward Kelly,and his Angel Magic experiments. When Dee met Kelly in 1582, he hadalready been undertaking such experiments for some time, possiblysince as early as 156914. The first entry in Dee’s diaries of these sessionsindicates that Dee was working with a Seer named Barnabas Saul, in158115. Elias Ashmole relates that from the secret cache of papers whichhe eventually published, half had previously been destroyed by a maid,who not knowing their importance, used them as firelighters16. Perhapsthese incinerated pages contained the records of the twelve missingyears of Dee’s magical experiments.From the records that do survive, we can describe Dee’s experimentsas follows. Dee always worked with a Seer, who would look into Dee’s“Shewstone,” i.e. a crystal ball, or an Obsidian “magic mirror”. Deewould usually begin each session by praying fervently. The Seer would21And I will not hide from you a further memorable mystagogy:consider that our Cross, containing so many ideas, concealstwo further letters if we examing carefully their numericalcirtues after a certain manner, so that, by a parallel method offollowing their verbal force with this same Cross, we recognisewith supreme admeration that it is from there that LIGHT isderived (LVX), the final word of themagistery, by the unionand conjunction of the Ternary within the unity of the Word.(Theorem7)"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001then look into the Shewstone and describe the visions he experienced.All the while Dee recorded what the Seer said, and would often addressquestions to the entity which was supposedly within the crystal. The firstrecorded skrying session, in 1581, began with Dee praying that an angelcalled Anael would appear to Saul in the crystal globe. Dee writes therecord of the session as if he converses directly with Anael, but weshould assume that Saul acted as the “mouthpiece” for the apparition inthe crystal.17Dee first met Kelly the following March, whereupon they continuedwith the experiments. Again Dee did not skry himself, this time Kellyfilled Saul’s role. Kelly saw himself as an alchemist - and possibly alsoa Ceremonial magician. If we assume that the visions Kelly saw pro-ceeded solely from his imagination, then that imagination seemedacquainted with grimoires such as the Lesser Key of Solomon. Forexample, on the 14thApril 1584, Kelly described the Angel Gabriel aspraying, describing God aswhich appears remarkably similar to an entreaty to the Great GodJehovah,a prayer to invoke ones Guardian Angel, from the Ars Paulina.19By far the most productive period of Dee and Kelly’s magical experi-ments occurred between 1582 and 1584, up to the end of their visit toCracow in Poland, and before they reached Prague in the modern-dayCzech Republic, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. During thistime, Dee and Kelly received a complete new system of ceremonialmagic known to us now as “Enochian Magic”. At first, the pair receivedthe design of the Holy Table, a wax seal called the “Sigillum DeiAemeth”, a Lamen formed from the names of the “Heptarchic” Kingsand Princes, a magic Ring, and seven tables of letters, forming the basisof the Tabula Bonorumand Tabula Collecta. From September 1583,they received revelations concerning 49 Good Angels, Liber Logaeth,and the Angelic Alphabet. Finally between April and July 1584, theyreceived Tablet of Nalvage, Liber Scientiae, the elemental Tablets andTablet of Union, and the 48 Enochian Calls.I do not propose to go into much detail about Enochian Magic, exceptfor a few general observations. To do any justice to the system wouldrequire more space than can be included in this article20.I would like to draw attention to some of the last of the materialreceived. In the Golden Dawn version system of Enochian magic, thefirst part with which the initiate comes into contact is the four elementaltablets, the Tablet of Union, and the Enochian Calls used to activatethem. But what exactly are they to be used for? The Angel Nalvagespeaking in relation of the First call specifically says it is to be used forEvocatory magic: to cause spirits to appear visibly, to force them to ren-der obedience, and make them “open the mysteries of their creation.”21In other words, it is a magical knowledge-gathering system.Later, the Angel Ave describes the function of the four Watchtowers:Therefore not only do the Watchtowers again constitute a magicalknowledge-gathering system; they also contain a method for achievingpractical magical results. Apparently, the original Golden Dawn hadlinked these eight functions to specific parts of the EnochianWatchtowers24. However, Israel Regardie arbitrarily omitted theseteachings from the book The Golden Dawnon the grounds that theysounded too mediaeval.25I find this a rather short-sighted attitude fromthe man who had no qualms against writing an introduction forCrowley’s “777”, which is just as much a manual for practical magic.Regardie seems to have overlooked the fact that Dee was no fool. HisMonas Hieroglyphicashows that he was well aware that Alchemyshould be taken metaphorically, not literally. Hence, if Dee heard thatsuch a thing was for “the knowledge, finding and use of metals” or thelike he would have understood the Alchemical cipher.Aside from the Watchtowers and the Calls, Liber Scientiae Auxilii etVictoriae Terrestriscontains details of how the Earth is divided into 91parts - each ruled over by a “prince or spiritual governor”. The 91 partsare divided into 30 sets or “Aethyrs” (Airs), (i.e. 29 of three and the 30thof 4) as the Angels which govern them are said to reside in 30 aerialregions between heaven and earth. Each of the 91 parts is thus called byone of the Calls of the Thirty Aethyrs - which has been made mostfamous by Aleister Crowley’s “The Vision and the Voice”.26Crowley used the Call of the Thirty Aethyrs as a method of initiation- each Aethyr revealed to him a successively more potent vision of theold Aeon passing away and the new one coming into existence. Mostinfamously, in the tenth Aethyr, he supposedly meets the demonChoronzon, and crosses “the Abyss” into the Supernal regions.Now the strange thing is this: nowhere in the Dee diaries does itdescribe this as the use of the Call of the Thirty Aethyrs. The only detailsthat mention it describe this system as a form of practical magic dealingwith the 91 parts of the Earth, and its spiritual Governors, i.e.Furthermore, it is said of the Angels of the Thirty Aethyrs that they22“...before whom the Quire of Heaven sing, O Mappa La manhallelujah.”18“...whereunto the whole choir of heaven sings continually OAlappa-le-man Hallelujah...”“1. All humane [sic] knowledge.2. Out of it springeth Physick.3. The knowledge of all elemental Creatures amongst you...4. The knowledg [sic] finding and use of Metals. The vertues ofthem.

Hereby you may subvert whole Countries without"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001Whilst there is a demon called “Coronzon” mentioned, it is not in thecontext of these Aethyrs, but separately, as the name of the serpent in theGarden of Eden.However, we do see in relation to the 91 parts of the Earth that thecommunicating Angel makes great emphasis of the number of “minis-tering Angels” possessed by each Governor. The allotment of minister-ing angels seems rather arbitrary - could it be that we have here anEnochian version of Mathesis? Also, given the similarity in principle ofthis system with the version of angel magic found in Trithemius’Steganographia, could we say that the one was inspired by the other?Might Liber Scientiaeeven constitute some kind of exercise inCryptography? Such questions for research fall outside the scope of thisarticle.Two questions naturally occur when considering Dee’s experimentswith Ritual Magic: can we accept that Dee sincerely contacted Angels;and further, can we accept that Dee contacted anykind of supposedly-supernatural entity?In 1599, Dee wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury:Dee thought that by an emphatic defence of his reputation such as this,he could quash the rumours of black magic that had hung about himsince 1555. The rumours continued afterward despite Dee’s efforts.Elizabeth may have tolerated Dee as an Astrologer, and even as anAlchemist, but she could not permit any kind of black magic to occur.An Act of Parliament made capital offences out of sorcery which causeddeath, conjuring any kind of evil spirit, even using magic to discoverhidden treasures (as a second offence) -. This would also have effective-ly criminalised many classical grimoires, some of which no doubt werein Dee’s famous library.Therefore, were it ever proved that Dee conjured devils, he would notmerely face social opprobrium but the death sentence as well. We cantherefore understand why in 1576 Dee successfully entered a Plea toforce John Foxe to remove references to him as “the Great Conjurer”from Actes and Monuments- a copy of which, updated annually, wasplaced in every English cathedral and many parish churches.However it seems that Dee held his reputation more important than hislife. For example, in 1604, five years after his letter to the Archbishop ofCanterbury, the rumours still continued. Dee therefore petitioned KingJames to put him on trial - in the hope that a Not Guilty verdict wouldquash the rumours once and for all. A Guilty verdict, on the other hand,would have proved fatal. As it happened, the King denied Dee his day inCourt, sparing him an ordeal, but also destroying Dee’s chance to sal-vage his tattered reputation. But the fact that Dee willingly risked his lifeto assert his reputation would seem to be strong evidence that his sin-cerity was unshakeable.We can remark that although Dee might have acted sincerely, his par-ticular method of working depended on the trustworthiness of his seer.Now here we encounter major controversy: how does one tell if a seercan be trusted? Muslims, for example, argue that God would onlychoose righteous people with a spotless reputation for honesty to speakHis Word. Therefore, Mohammed unsurprisingly fits the Muslim idealof a Prophet. However, Edward Kelly seems to have fallen somewhatshort of Mohammed in the righteousness and honesty stakes, at leastbefore he met Dee. A number of stories hang around Kelly’s past; he leftOxford University in mysterious circumstances, he was pilloried inLancaster for either forging title deeds or counterfeiting money. He iseven said to have dug up a corpse to perform a Necromantic operation.Add to this that he first met Dee using an alias.In modern times this has caused serious problems for a number of peo-ple. For example, Paul Foster Case said that he could not believe a sup-posedly-divine science as “Enochian Magic” could have been chan-nelled through such an obvious rogue as Kelly. Consequently Case’sorder, the Builders of the Adytum, to this day follow many of the prac-tices of the Golden Dawn, but not Enochian magic.Others however take a more sympathetic view. Peter French points outthat in most of the skrying sessions, the structure begins with Dee pray-ing fervently that God might send a holy Angel into his Shewstone.French speculates that the fervency of Dee’s prayers, as well as the mag-netism of his personality, dominated the Seer’s mind - so that the visionsin the Shewstone truly derived from Dee’s own efforts, not Kelly’simagination.29If we accept the truth of this, we can further infer thevalidity of the Angel Magick experiments if we can accept Dee’s profi-ciency as a magician.The main criticism usually directed against the experiments consists inthe fact that at times the “Angels” purportedly told Kelly messageswhich belied their supposedly “heavenly” status. The most infamous ofthese occurred near the end of Dee and Kelly’s association, the “wife-swapping” incident in 1589. An Angel apparently told Kelly that he andDee should share their wives in common. They apparently went throughwith it, though Dee tried in vain to erase the incident from his diary. Itwould seem that the tensions in the Dee household, as well perhaps asthe guilt which Dee now felt, led him to break off his relationship withKelly permanently.And yet, one should proceed cautiously here. Dee’s diary tells that thisparticular Angel first contacted Kelly without Dee’s knowledge. Kellyclaimed that the Angel contacted him, without Dee present, and that sub-sequently, with Dee in attendance, the Angel repeated its message.Compare this with the hypothesis proposed by French above: the vitalingredients of Dee’s magnetic personality and his fervent prayers did notplay a part in the particular message. One can quite easily speculate that23from my youth hitherto, I haue vsed, and still vse, good, lawfull,honest, christian, and diuinely prescribed meanes, to attaine tothe knowledge of those truthes, which are meet, and necessaryfor me to know;(A Letter, Containing a most briefe Discourse Apologeticall)Armies: which you must, and shall do, for the glory of God. Bythese you shall get the favour of all Princes, whom you take pityof or wish well unto. Hereby shall you know the SecretTreasures of the waters, and unknown Caves of he Earth.”28"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001in this instance Kelly lied.However, the Angels’ messages did not all contain objectionable mate-rial - far from it! It would seem that during the tour of Europe which Deeand Kelly made between 1583 and 1589, the Angels inspired Dee andtransformed him into an apostle of reconciliation, between the Catholicand Protestant churches. Dee believed he had a sacred mission to healthe rift which had opened up between the two factions, which appearedto him as the most serious threat that the Christian faith had ever faced.Thus, Dee found himself in Prague in 1586, preaching the values ofChristian unity to the Papal Nuntio (i.e. the Vatican ambassador). Againone would have difficulty questioning Dee’s personal sincerity, asdespite the worthiness of his message, the Nuntio took great exceptionto it. The Pope himself ordered Dee and Kelly’s arrest and transportationto Rome for interrogation. This never happened as the pair receivedshelter from the Duke of Bavaria, who managed to intercede on theirbehalf.Perhaps the most sensible approach to Dee’s Angel Magic consists ofnot accepting it blindly, or rejecting it out of hand, but examining it pieceby piece to discover the circumstances in which it was received.Final YearsAfter Dee split up with Kelley, he returned home to face declining for-tunes. Many of his former friends were now either old, dead or wilfullydistant. The old rumours about conjuring demons circulated still, despiteDee’s attempts to refute them.Queen Elizabeth tried to help Dee out by gaining him the Wardenshipof Christ’s College, Manchester. However Dee found this very difficultas he encountered open hostility from the Fellows there.In 1603, Elizabeth I died, and James I succeeded her. James disap-proved strongly of anything that smacked of witchcraft. Therefore Deefound that his reputation at court, which had just about been tepidbeforehand, cooled right down indeed. It was during this time that Deeunsuccessfully tried to be put on trial, in order to quash the bad rumourshanging about him (vide supra).In 1605, disaster struck Dee twice. First his wife Jane died of theplague. Then, unable to bear the hostility of the Fellows at Manchester,Dee was forced to step down from his post. This reduced him to pover-ty. For the last three years of his life, Dee occasionally carried on moreAngel magic experiments, and scraping by, by selling books out of hisfamous library. He died in 1608, aged 81.ConclusionJohn Dee’s influence on the course of the Western Mystery Traditionis due first and foremost to his position as a leading intellect inElizabethan England, a reputation which he had established quite inde-pendently of his achievements in magic. He was held in fascination bythe nobility, which allowed him both to be employed in what wereimportant matters of state. and to conduct his magical experiments inrelative peace.Secondly, there is the matter of his magical work itself. Not only washe responsible for midwifing the reception of Enochian Magic, whichtoday is a source of endless fascination amongst occultists, but even hisworks such as Monas Hieroglyphicashow a shrewd mind, full of ideaswhich themselves subtly influenced later magicians.There are several traits to Dee’s character, which crop up consistentlyin both his magical and non-magical work. First and foremost, he was acollector of Knowledge. Between the years 1570 - 1581 Dee was theowner of the finest library in England, and possibly in Europe, at hishouse in Mortlake. That Dee managed this is undoubtedly due to hisambition to fill his home with the finest scholarly materials then in exis-tence. We know that Dee went to great trouble to search for obscure andhard to come-by works, many of which were not even in print. Somemight find it hard to believe that Dee, being a man of such intelligence,would seriously indulge himself in the world of the spirits. But to Dee,magic was simply an extension of this Knowledge-Collecting: the ideathat Angels could provide even more knowledge than was possible togain on Earth held an irresistible fascination for Dee.Dee was not only interested in Knowledge, but in Exploration. Wemust remember that much of the planet remained unexplored in Dee’stime. In fact, as a source of the Unknown it rivalled the Knowledge sup-posedly to be gained from esoteric realms as food for Dee’s imagination.Thus, in his exoteric life we observe Dee’s contribution to Navigation,his support for the emergence of British imperialism, and his just miss-ing out on owning most of Canada. In his magical work, we see that Deewas keenly interested in using otherworldly powers to discover and per-haps influence what went on in other places in the globe. For example,there is Dee’s early interest in Trithemius’ Steganographia, to the recep-tion of the Enochian material concerning the 91 Parts of the Earth.We should always remember that Dee’s education, and therefore hisoutlook on life, was purely of the times, i.e. the Renaissance. We may befamiliar with the artistic creations of the geniuses of the era which arethe Renaissance’s legacy, but when we try to understand the mentality ofthose people we are confronted with modes of thought which are aliento our modern day understanding. Dee was a scientist, but the rationaleof Renaissance science was different to that of the present era. For exam-ple, in those days it was usual to argue deductively from an a priorithe-ory. Now it is more usual to form an a posterioritheory from inductivereasoning. What this means practically is that the Renaissance scientistwould spend a lot of time creating a model which would explain hisbeliefs, and later test the model with experimentation. Sometimes, so-called scientists of that era might not even get around to the experimen-tation; the construction of the model thereby becoming an exercise inmental aesthetics.Moreover, there were a number of a priori assumptions which wereseldom questioned at all, for example, the existence of God. Thus it wasquite reasonable, as far as Dee was concerned, to argue in hisMathematicall Prefacefor a “Mathetic” vision of reality in whichMathematics is seen not just as a science but a way of describing boththe secret workings of Nature and of God. Of course, this theory owes24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Journal of the Western Mystery TraditionNo. 1, Autumnal Equinox 2001no small amount of inspiration to Henry Cornelius Agrippa, with whoseworks Dee was fully conversant.Given that this Deductive-style of reasoning was the normal mode ofoperation at the time, it is perhaps not surprising that Dee did not seemto use Enochian Magic after he had received it. To Dee, the reception ofthe Enochian material was a work in itself. Its possible use in practicalsituations thereafter was a separate matter entirely.We should also remember that Enochian Magic is a complex system,especially as there is little detail in the original Dee diaries as to how itis to be used. It would have taken Dee an extremely long time to turnEnochian into a fully-fledged magical system, and even longer to goabout practising it. However, at the time, Dee was busy travelling aroundEurope, often trying to escape the attentions of unsympathetic nobles,and of the Catholic Church. On his return he faced increasing apathy,and later suspicion, from nobles and academic colleagues. We may alsoinfer that the circumstances of his break-up with Kelley upset him great-ly, and caused him to practice magic only intermittently thereafter.Dee’s reputation might have been greater still, as there is evidencetwelve years’ worth of magical records (from 1569 to 1581) are missingfrom his Diaries. Perhaps these were among the papers that were unwit-tingly burnt by a servant before being handed over to Elias Ashmole.The Deductive reasoning of the Renaissance period meant that a lot ofbeliefs were included among the sciences, which today might be regard-ed as superstition. Take Astrology for example. In those days no differ-ence was seen between this and astronomy. Because in Deductive rea-soning the explanation is created before the experimental proof is found,a theory like Astrology would remain valid until it was disproved, unlikenowadays where it would not be created until it was proved. Thus it wasperfectly reasonable during Renaissance times for a man like Dee tostudy, and master Astrology. Moreover, the central idea of Hermeticism, that the Macrocosm andthe Microcosm are somehow linked together, would have appealed toDee and enabled him to forge a link in his own mind between God,Astrology, Natural Magic, and all of creation itself.The Renaissance was a time of enthusiasm for the novelty of therebirth of classicism. But the late 16thcentury was also an apocalyptictime as well. There was a rumour among astrologers that at the end ofthe 16thcentury the heavens would be aligned in exactly the same wayas they were at the time of the birth of Christ. Therefore, the SecondComing was thought to be imminent. This may also explain the appear-ance of the Rosicrucian Fraternity in the beginning of the 17thCentury.But the Second Coming also implied the rise of the Antichrist as well.We may scoff at this now, but we should also consider that the 16thcen-tury had also seen a major split in the Christian Church, into Catholicand Protestant. This fuelled speculation that the split was actually thework of the Devil, who was attempting to destroy the true Church. It isnot surprising therefore that Dee himself was concerned to heal the splitin the Church, through the doctrine of Eirenicism, where the doctrinaldifferences of Catholicism and Protestantism were reconciled by refer-ence to the non-Christian teachings of Hermeticism. It is also not sur-prising that the Enochian material received by Dee is full of apocalypticcomments. For Dee did not see himself merely as an intellectual andmathematician, but even as a magus commissioned by God to bringhealing to the Western European civilisation.__________________________Notes1.
