Despite Finland’s location amidst the Scandinavian countries, the Finns are not Scandinavian. They came out of Asia thousands of years ago and settled in Finland at least 4,000 years ago. Their language is closer to Ugrian, Samoyed or Korean than the nearby German, Russian or Swedish. According to Finnish Magic by Robert Nelson, “There is evidence that the Finno-Ugrians anciently occupied a major part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, and possibly part of the British isles. J. F. Campbell and others have taught that the aboriginal inhabitants of the British Isles were Finns displaced by the conquering Celts and Germans, who seemed to associate the Finns with magic. The old Norse word for sorcery, finngerd, literally meant ‘a Finn’s work.’” It is also thought that the Finns conquered and absorbed the Lapps as they traveled through the north and their are similarities between languages to support this. The Finns were seen as warriors, but in some ways this is a role that was thrust upon them. Finns served the Byzantine emperors as bodyguards, palace police and soldiers. They served the Uppsala kings of ancient Sweden in Viking conquests throughout the Baltic and North Sea areas. After Finland was made a province of Sweden by Swedish King Eric the Good and Bishop Henry of Uppsala, the Finns often found themselves in wars that were more like fights for survival than matters of territoriality. Finnish warrior spirit is more a sign of indomitable will than one of blood-thirstiness. They survived forty-two wars with Russia, having lost all of them. They paid their war debts when richer countries didn’t. These are examples of what the Finns would call sisu. Sisu doesn’t have a translation but it represents the philosophy that what needs to be done, will be"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"done, no matter the cost. “Strong will takes a person even through stone.” The Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, is probably the only such epic which is not about war. Considering that for most of Finland’s history it didn’t have it’s own government, this makes a point about the temperament of the Finns. Magic The Finns have long been associated with magic. Sailors considered it bad luck to kill a Finn. The Norwegian kings forbade their citizens to travel to Finland to consult magicians. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Swedish government searched for and confiscated goudbas, the magic drums of the Lapp and Finn shamans. There have been many stories of Finns controlling the wind, something very useful for Vikings and sailors of all sorts. \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" A shaman drum (goudbas) While Finnish magic includes ways to capture wind into knots for use later, the magic is based in shamanism, which Nelson describes as “the practice of using altered states of consciousness to influence the world and acquire power.” Finnish shaman made particular use of songs and chants and the phrase “to sing” someone meant to perform magic on them. For example, the contest between Väinämöinen and Joukahainen starts with Joukahainen’s challenge: “If you’re old Väinämöinen the everlasting singer let us start singing begin reciting"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" with man testing man one defeating the other!” Great importance was placed on knowing the right words for the songs and knowing the origin of a thing gave you power over it. Spirits were everywhere in nature and a shaman could gain knowledge by observation or by being taught, but the most useful method was by going into a trance. Shaman and magi are called “word-masters,” but knowing the words is not enough. The knowledge must be used by an act of will. To make this act of will take place, the mage must develop the disciplines of focus, practice, purification and trance work. The trance work was often preceded by a sauna (an invention of the Finns) which was perhaps a ritual cleansing and could also be used as part of the trance itself. Trance work was usually done in groups with loud and energetic chanting, but it could be done alone and quietly. Dancing could be used to enter a trance state. One of the things which could be accomplished in a trance state was to communicate with haltija. The haltija is the spirit of a thing, whether it be a tree, a place, an object, etc. The haltija is not a spirit which can be separated from a host object, the haltija is more the spiritual essence of the object. Nelson points out that magic, while being based in the spiritual, was used for practical purposes as well. In the Kalevala, Väinämöinen uses his magic to build a ship and to aid agriculture. Ilmarinen uses his magical ability, combined with his expertise as a smith, to create the Sampo, an artifact that creates corn, salt and money. Then the smith Ilmarinen put this into words: “I’ll be able to forge the Sampo beat out the bright-lid from a swan’s quill tip \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\t\u0004\u0002\u0004\u000b\u0002\f\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u0002\u0010\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u0002\u0013\u0002\u0014\u0015\u0006\u0002\u0016\u0017\u0004\b\u0006\u000e\t\u0007\u0002\u0018\t\u0019\u000e\r\u000e\u001a\u0002\u0013\u0002\u001b\u001b\u001b\u001c\u0017\r\u0007\u000e\u0006\u000f\u001d\u001e\r\u0011\t\u0007\u0012\u001c\u0007\u0004\u001e\u0002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" a barren cow’s milk a small barley grain a summer ewe’s down because I have forged the sky beaten out the lid of heaven with nothing to start off from with not a shred ready made.” According to Nelson, there is evidence that the Finns also knew and used the futhark and were familiar with the Norse pantheon. In the Kalevala, one of the places a runaway fire passes through is “Thor’s field edge” and, when Väinämöinen needs to determine what happened to the sun and moon, which are missing, he apparently uses runes. He, the old Väinämöinen the everlasting wise man from an alder cut slivers laid the slivers out set about turning the lots his fingers arranging them Festivals The Finns divided the year into four quarters. The dates for these holidays are approximate since there was a lot of individual adaptation involved in everything they did. The Finns were also aware of the cultures of those around them and adapted and adopted as necessary. For instance, when Christian influence increased, St. Anthony’s Day (January 17th) was melded into a continuation of the house spirit cult. A rag doll or candle would be made to represent the spirit of the house or farm. The doll or candle would be kept somewhere appropriate (like a grain bin) and later in the year would be offered food and prayer. The dates for the quarters and some other holidays are: ∑Plough Day - April 14 ∑Bear’s Day - July 13"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"∑Withering Day - October 14 ∑Collection Day - January 14 ∑Summer festival, or kesäjuhlat would begin on St. John’s Eve (or Juhunnas) and the longest day of the year would be celebrated. ∑Midwinter or Yuletide would be celebrated around December 21-23. ∑The National Winter Festival or Laskaiainen is celebrated around February 7. This festival honored woman and their handiwork. It marked the beginning of weaving for the year and it was bad luck if the spinning wasn’t done by then. ∑Spring Equinox was celebrated, marking the time when animals were first freed from the barn for grazing. ∑Autumn Equinox was celebrated around September 21-23. It was a harvest celebration marked with feasts, sacrifices, story telling music and the sauna. At the harvest, the first or last sheaf cut would be saved and offered beer and food on Christmas eve to ensure that the grain would grow the next year. ∑August Eve or August 1st was the festival of first fruits. ∑November Eve is the feast of remembrance. The shamans believed the doorway between the seen/material world and the unseen/immaterial/spiritual world was open. It was celebrated with sacrifices and ancestral remembrances. Ancestor Worship The Finns have strong ties to their ancestors. Although the ancestors have gone on to the spirit world, they maintain an interest in their descendants.
