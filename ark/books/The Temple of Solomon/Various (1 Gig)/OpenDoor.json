For others, I speak in parables.\"In every age and in every country there are always those few individuals who seek moresatisfying answers to the great questions of Life than they can find in their local churchesand temples or through science. If their quest is sincere and they persist, they will eventuallybe drawn into contact with one of the world's Mystery Schools, where they may beinstructed and trained. There have always been centers, calledMystery Schools,respondingto the cry for understanding from aspirants throughout the ages.Today such close secrecy is no longer necessary. Much may now be given out openly whichformerly could be imparted only in private and by word of mouth. The greatest secrets,however, can never be transmitted by written or spoken word. That secrecy which guardsthe deepest esoteric knowledge is not imposed by the custodians of Ageless Wisdom but byhuman ignorance. It is the kind of secrecy which shrouds the work of great scientists such asBor, Curie, Einstein, Edison and others. This secrecy does not result from any deliberatewithholding but rather from a mass ignorance and consequent inability to understand theconcepts and reasoning required by advanced science.The custodiansof AgelessWisdomcan no more disclosetheirknowledge to untrained men and women than great scientists can explaintheir theories of the universe to children who are still in kindergartenThe work of these schools is intensely practical. The student is given theoretical knowledgetogether with experimental work so that he learns both by precept and experience. As hecontinues with the process of self-unfolding, he gradually increases mastery of himself, firstin small things, then in greater.From within those walls, a secret knowledge calledTheAgeless Wisdomhas been known and used for many cen-turies in enlightening the spiritual aspirants of each epoch.It is calledAgelessbecause it is not susceptible to themutations of time nor is the Ageless Wisdom primarily aproduct of man's thinking. Itiswritten by God upon theface of nature,there for all to read, if they can. Hitherto,the great practical secrets have been guarded carefullyfrom spiritual dilettantes and have only been given to dulyinitiated men and women under the strictest pledges ofsecrecy. In the past, this secrecy has been necessarybecause of the ecclesiastic and legal restrictions uponfreedom of thought and worship."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3BUILDERS OF THE ADYTUMBUILDERS OF THE ADYTUM(B.O.T.A.) is a true Mystery School;an international, non-profit,teaching and training Order and an outer vehicle of the Inner Spiritual Hierarchy,sometimes called the Inner School, which guides the evolution of Man.Adytumis an ancientGreek word designating the innermost part of the Temple, theHoly of Holies, that Which isnot made with hands.Its system is that of the Western, Qabalistic-Hermetic tradition, and itsteachings have been handed down from Adepts to Initiates since very ancient times. Thefounder of B.O.T.A., Dr. Paul Foster Case, was such an Adept.As a recognized world authority on the Tarot and Qabalah, he was given the task by theInner School of reinterpreting the Ageless Wisdom into modern idiom. Deciding to devotehis life to this project, he abandoned a successful career as a musical conductor and foundedB.O.T.A. in the early twenties. Because of his close contact with the Inner School and totalcommitment to serving mankind, he became a fountain of living wisdom, disseminatedthrough his tracts, lessons, lectures and books. After his death in 1954, his colleague, Dr. AnnDavies, extended the teachings of B.O.T.A. to their present state and initiated theinternational expansion of the Order. The lessons and some of the books of these twospiritual Adepts have been published in French and Spanish, and other translations are inprocess.To only desire healing and wealth is not enough and will surely result in failure. So we seekthose individuals who are well motivated that will persist in our Work and not just skim thesurface. B.O.T.A. does not offer to remake your world for you. It does offer you the keys toknowledge that will enable you to do it for yourself, with the inner help that linkage with atrue Mystery School confers. Our name, Builders of the Adytum, indicates that we proposeto help you build theInner Templewherein conscious contact with the Higher Self may bemade and your true spiritual heritage may be realized.The Work of B.O.T.A. does not bid for your interest on thegrounds of mere antiquity but because it has met thetests of centuries of application. However, lest you thinkthat the spiritual attainment possible through followingthese teachings is to be had in some miraculous manner,B.O.T.A. declares to you at the outset that your sincerity,your desire, and your willingness to work will be the solemeasure of your accomplishment. The teaching nowoffered by B.O.T.A. was given only to selected students inthe past. For you to be successful in our Work, yourpersonal goals must correspond to those of the Order:personal enlightenment, self-transmutation, and service toLife."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4OBJECTIVESThere is a fundamental impulse within you to seek understanding, wisdom, true knowledgeof yourself, nature, and the universe. The Mystery Schools are and always have been therepositories of special knowledge that is the key to the realization of all that you seek. It isour objective to place this key in the hands of those who are ready to receive and act uponit. This special knowledge enables you to know yourself and your creative powers, and tomake for yourself the kind of world you want to live in. The problems that you face in life arenot really obstacles, but like a closed door to a room that holds special knowledge. B.O.T.A.gives you the key that will unlock the problem doors of your life, and in their opening, yourhealth, prosperity, and the mastery of your life and environment will increase.You cease to regard problems as indications of failure but as the means to gain new levels ofunderstanding and control that you need in your spiritual journey. You learn the vitalcreative relationship between thinking and feeling so that you can use this knowledge torecreate your world. The spiritual imperative that is elaborated in B.O.T.A. members is“Man, know thyself, and as thou knowest thyself, thou knowest thy Creator.The practical work of B.O.T.A., which includes study,meditation, imagery and ritual, initiates a series of subtle butimportant changes in your inner world, not the least of whichis an expansion of your conscious awareness. Even a slightincrease in this area has a remarkable effect on yourmental/emotional capacities. Your intelligence increases andyou become more aware of your motivations. You becomemore observant, which improves your memory. Your abilityto anticipate future effects of present causes is enhanced,improving your discrimination in making choices. Objectivityis increased, aiding the ability to think more logically andclearly, which increases control over your environment andhelps you define your goals.Through the lessons, meditations, and practices ofB.O.T.A., you are brought to a higher state of con-sciousness where you can have direct knowledge of theanswers to the age-old questions of the soul, \"Who am I?What am I? What am I supposed to be doing?\" Theprocess that leads to a direct, experiential knowing of theanswers to these questions dissolves the fear of death andestablishes an intuitional certainty of the rightness of thePath you have chosen. In time, the quality of compassionwill begin to dominate your personality expression — thesign of true brotherhood."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5Over the ages, hundreds have realized their spiritual goals through exactly this same trainingso that you can depend on its being thoroughly tested and proven. If you faithfully followthe instructions that are sent to all members of this Order, you will find yourself becomingincreasingly receptive to the guidance of the Higher Self, which is the beginning of thetransformational process. B.O.T.A. fully realizes the implications of such assertions and theresponsibility incurred in making them, yet they are made deliberately and are intended tobe taken literally.HIGHER STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESSThat you may understand what is meant by \"a higher state of consciousness,\" consider thevarious kingdoms of nature. Each has a progressively wider range of awareness. Thesedifferent ranges of awareness are clearly defined, from the apparent unconsciousness ofminerals through the subconscious life processes of plants to the first glimmerings of self-consciousness in higher animals. Self-consciousness reaches its fullness in man, and he isable to reason, to formulate speech, to use tools, and to modify his environment de-liberately. HIGHER consciousness goes even beyond self-consciousness. It has been calledthe consciousness beyond thought — the level ofintuition.It is through this level ofconsciousness that direct knowledge of the answers to Life's questions are realized andone's path — past, present and future — is clearly seen.Corresponding with the evolution of form upon this planet is the evolution of consciousness.It can be postulated that in the natural course of events, all mankind will ultimately possessa higher state of consciousness. Almost incomprehensible periods of time elapse, however,before such changes occur in the slow processes of nature. Yet, speed-ups are possible asman is endowed with special mental and physical faculties which, with proper training,enable him to bring thisabout much sooner. This spiritual forcing process is the work of theMystery Schools, and it is to this purpose that our curriculum is structured.B.O.T.A. seeks to disclose to all earnest seekers the meanswhereby they may induce a higher state of consciousawareness. This aim is identical with all the the greatspiritual teachings throughout the ages. ALL spiritualattainment comes through the expansion ofconscious awareness, which is sometimes called anawakening,and in a largersense—illumination.B.O.T.A.offers you keys to such expansion andprovides you withthe necessary training methods and the techniques for itsrealization. These methods are clearly formulated to helpthe earnest seeker discover the means whereby higher orexpanded states of consciousness may be experienced.Possession of such expanded states of consciousness willunerringly bring you closer to what you want to be and doin the world."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6CURRICULUMThe Western presentation of Ageless Wisdom is composed of theQABALAHand what isusually known as theHERMETICarts and sciences. The Hermetic System is named afterHermes Trismegistus,the reported founder of the esoteric tradition of the Western world.On the contrary, they constitute an interlocking system of studies and practices which hasserved as the foundation of the Western Mystery training for many generations and they aretreated as such by B.O.T.A. The particular potency of this system lies in its use of symbols,which are a universal language that directly instructs subconsciousness with its pictorialwisdom, regardless of language differences.Thus, with the Qabalah, we include— spiritual Alchemy,esoteric Astrology and Tarot. Nearly all these esoteric arts andsciences, falling into the hands of materialistic opportunists,have been misused for financial and power-seeking purposes.Astrology and Tarot, in particular, have been abused. The highspiritual aim of true alchemy has been perverted by the greedof gold-seekers. The Qabalah has been obscured by thosewho misinterpret the letter of the Scriptures. Yet, properlyinstructed students know that these Hermetic arts andsciences are by no means deluded imaginings or ignorantsuperstitions that some persons suppose them to be.However mysterious and esoteric it may sound, the newstudent is not plunged into a maze of obscure andcomplicated teachings. Although B.O.T.A. is considered theuniversity level of esoteric teaching and training systems in theworld, the work is taught in easy stages and with practicesthat are perfectly safe, in a form that any intelligent adult canunderstand. All students are required to take the samesubjects, which provide the necessary foundation forimprinting the principles of the Ageless Wisdom onconsciousness. Membership in B.O.T.A. does not require youto relinquish affiliation with your religion or other Orders."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7The daily life of the Western aspirant is his schoolroom, his meditation, place,and his alchemical laboratory.After you become a member, the first two months of instruction are spent in study andexperiments in Hermetic psychology. These first lessons lay the foundation of theory andpractice upon which thesuperstructure of all subsequent work is erected. They include anexplanation of the inner nature of what we regard as problems, their karmic relationshipand their purpose on the Path.Through this understanding your daily experience takes on a totally different significance asthe thread of Divine guidance is seen. When you finish this preliminary work, you willreceive a set of Tarot Keys. Becoming acquainted with these Keys in preparation for detailedinstruction as to their meaning and use, constitutes the next three months study. This buildsthe foundation of an intensely interesting and important phase of B.O.T.A. work in thefundamentals of Tarot, which occupies the teaching for the following year. Tarot has wellbeen called one of the foremost aids to spiritual transmutation as the series of Tarot Keys isa record of the inner knowledge of the Western Sages in picture form — the way the Wiseregard the Universe and Man in a manner that impresses the consciousness of all who usethe Tarot.The only difference between an Adept and a natural, awakened man, isthe way the Adept thinks, regarding himself, the universe, and his Creator.Lest you misunderstand the \"right use\" of Tarot, we do not refer to its use in fortune-tellingor divination. Its right use is in study, meditation and imagery, for which it was created.Training in the use and meaning of the Tarot is the essential foundation from which you cansafely proceed to the more advanced courses of our curriculum.As an instrument of mind training, the Tarot is designed inaccordance with basic laws of human psychology. It was originallydevised as a means of conveying universal principles regardingMan's structure, place and purpose in the Cosmos, through theuse of symbols. Symbols are the language of subconsciousness inthat they communicate ideas to all individuals, regardless of theirnative tongue. No matter what your present situation, no matterwhat your past history, if your aspiration is sincere, the right useof Tarot can bring a change for the better in your life."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8When you have completed the course in the fundamentals of Tarot, you will be ready toundertake more advanced instruction in subjects which will disclose to you methods andinformation that have been kept secret for centuries, and which have only recently beenmade available to students who are not pledged initiates of esoteric orders.
