The coils of Leviathan to be held up to the twelve wings of Azazel - Samael, the Serpent Angel, from whom I recite glorious and beautiful and above and so below. I stood at the tower and gave the cup unto the great spirit of fire, whom was as a mirror in my eyes. Entry unto this tower of the Sun, revealed as fire and black basalt through the mind of the seer. As I entered the tower I beheld the Angel whom was death and life, who showered in the beauty of the emerald cup, which as I beheld this beautiful chalice, passed through the Guardians of the Path, by the Sword of Flame, the Angel of Aiwaz, known as Shaitan. I am as thee - IAO! By the Scepter, blade of death, under the shadow I grow - I am as thee IAO! I then stood before HER, known unto this being, the seven fold star of flame and blood was imprinted in my soul....I looked deep unto Her eyes, known the shadow and vampyre form of the Goddess. I took then the mark of the Beast, the Antichrist from the Sea, the Sun and Moon in unity. I then acknowledged I am separate from all things, in unity through disunity. I am a Son of Set.
