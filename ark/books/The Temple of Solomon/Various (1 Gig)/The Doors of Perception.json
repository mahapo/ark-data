Anhalonium lewinii was new to science.To primitive religion and the Indians of Mexico and the American Southwest it was a friend ofimmemorially long standing. Indeed, it was much more than a friend. In the words of one of the earlySpanish visitors to the New World, \"they eat a root which they call peyote, and which they venerate asthough it were a deity.\"Why they should have venerated it as a deity became apparent when such eminent psychologists asJaensch, Havelock Ellis and Weir Mitchell began their experiments with mescalin, the active principle ofpeyote. True, they stopped short at a point well this side of idolatry; but all concurred in assigning tomescalin a position among drugs of unique distinction. Administered in suitable doses, it changes thequality of consciousness more profoundly and yet is less toxic than any other substance in thepharmacologist's repertory.Mescalin research has been going on sporadically ever since the days of Lewin and Havelock Ellis.Chemists have not merely isolated the alkaloid; they have learned how to synthesize it, so that the supplyno longer depends on the sparse and intermittent crop of a desert cactus. Alienists have dosedthemselves with mescalin in the hope thereby of coming to a better, a first-hand, understanding of theirpatients' mental processes. Working unfortunately upon too few subjects within too narrow a range ofcircumstances, psychologists have observed and catalogued some of the drug's more striking effects.Neurologists and physiologists have found out something about the mechanism of its action upon thecentral nervous system. And at least one Professional philosopher has taken mescalin for the light it maythrow on such ancient, unsolved riddles as the place of mind in nature and the relationship between brainand consciousness1.There matters rested until, two or three years ago, a new and perhaps highly significant fact wasobserved2. Actually the fact had been staring everyone in the face for several decades; but nobody, as ithappened, had noticed it until a Young English psychiatrist, at present working in Canada, was struckby the close similarity, in chemical composition, between mescalin and adrenalin.

S. Slotkin has written that \"the habitual use of Peyote does not seem to produceany increased tolerance or dependence. I know many people who have been Peyotists for forty to fifty years. Theamount of Peyote they use depends upon the solemnity of the occasion; in general they do not take any more Peyotenow than they did years ago. Also, there is sometimes an interval of a month or more between rites, and they gowithout Peyote during this period without feeling any craving for it. Personally, even after a series of rites occurringon four successive weekends. I neither increased the amount of Peyote consumed nor felt any continued need for it.\"It is evidently with good reason that \"Peyote has never been legally declared a narcotic, or its use prohibited by thefederal government.\" However, \"during the long history of Indian-white contact, white officials have usually tried tosuppress the use of Peyote, because it has been conceived to violate their own mores. But these at- tempts havealways failed.\" In a footnote Dr. Slotkin adds that \"it is amazing to hear the fantastic stories about the effects ofPeyote and the nature of the ritual, which are told by the white and Catholic Indian officials in the MenominiReservation. None of them have had the slightest first-hand experience with the plant or with the religion, yet somefancy themselves to be authorities and write official reports on the subject.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3revealed that lysergic acid, an extremely potent hallucinogen derived from ergot, has a structuralbiochemical relationship to the others. Then came the discovery that adrenochrome, which is a productof the decomposition of adrenalin, can produce many of the symptoms observed in mescalinintoxication. But adrenochrome probably occurs spontaneously in the human body. In other words,each one of us may be capable of manufacturing a chemical, minute doses of which are known to causeProfound changes in consciousness. Certain of these changes are similar to those which occur in thatmost characteristic plague of the twentieth century, schizophrenia. Is the mental disorder due to achemical disorder? And is the chemical disorder due, in its turn, to psychological distresses affecting theadrenals? It would be rash and premature to affirm it. The most we can say is that some kind of a primafacie case has been made out. Meanwhile the clue is being systematically followed, the sleuths -biochemists , psychiatrists, psychologists - are on the trail.By a series of, for me, extremely fortunate circumstances I found myself, in the spring of 1953,squarely athwart that trail. One of the sleuths had come on business to California. In spite of seventyyears of mescalin research, the psychological material at his disposal was still absurdly inadequate, andhe was anxious to add to it. I was on the spot and willing, indeed eager, to be a guinea pig. Thus it cameabout that, one bright May morning, I swallowed four-tenths of a gram of mescalin dissolved in half aglass of water and sat down to wait for the results.We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we areby ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the loversdesperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its verynature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights,fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. Wecan pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation,every human group is a society of island universes. Most island universes are sufficiently like one anotherto Permit of inferential understanding or even of mutual empathy or \"feeling into.\" Thus, remembering ourown bereavements and humiliations, we can condole with others in analogous circumstances, can putourselves (always, of course, in a slightly Pickwickian sense) in their places. But in certain casescommunication between universes is incomplete or even nonexistent. The mind is its own place, and thePlaces inhabited by the insane and the exceptionally gifted are so different from the places whereordinary men and women live, that there is little or no common ground of memory to serve as a basis forunderstanding or fellow feeling. Words are uttered, but fail to enlighten. The things and events to whichthe symbols refer belong to mutually exclusive realms of experience.To see ourselves as others see us is a most salutary gift. Hardly less important is the capacity to seeothers as they see themselves. But what if these others belong to a different species and inhabit aradically alien universe? For example, how can the sane get to know what it actually feels like to bemad? Or, short of being born again as a visionary, a medium, or a musical genius, how can we ever visitthe worlds which, to Blake, to Swedenborg, to Johann Sebastian Bach, were home? And how can aman at the extreme limits of ectomorphy and cerebrotonia ever put himself in the place of one at thelimits of endomorphy and viscerotonia, or, except within certain circumscribed areas, share the feelingsof one who stands at the limits of mesomorphy and somatotonia? To the unmitigated behaviorist suchquestions, I suppose, are meaningless. But for those who theoretically believe what in practice theyknow to be true - namely, that there is an inside to experience as well as an outside - the problemsposed are real problems, all the more grave for being, some completely insoluble, some soluble only inexceptional circumstances and by methods not available to everyone. Thus, it seems virtually certain thatI shall never know what it feels like to be Sir John Falstaff or Joe Louis. On the other hand, it had"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4always seemed to me possible that, through hypnosis, for example, or autohypnosis, by means ofsystematic meditation, or else by taking the appropriate drug, I might so change my ordinary mode ofconsciousness as to be able to know, from the inside, what the visionary, the medium, even the mysticwere talking about.From what I had read of the mescalin experience I was convinced in advance that the drug wouldadmit me, at least for a few hours, into the kind of inner world described by Blake and AE. But what Ihad expected did not happen. I had expected to lie with my eyes shut, looking at visions of many-colored geometries, of animated architectures, rich with gems and fabulously lovely, of landscapes withheroic figures, of symbolic dramas trembling perpetually on the verge of the ultimate revelation. But Ihad not reckoned, it was evident, with the idiosyncrasies of my mental make-up, the facts of mytemperament, training and habits.I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer. Words, even thepregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions greet me on theverge of sleep. When I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seenevent or object. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterdayafternoon, of how the Lungarno used to look before the bridges were destroyed, of the BayswaterRoad when the only buses were green and tiny and drawn by aged horses at three and a half miles anhour. But such images have little substance and absolutely no autonomous life of their own. They standto real, perceived objects in the same relation as Homer's ghosts stood to the men of flesh and blood,who came to visit them in the shades. Only when I have a high temperature do my mental images cometo independent life. To those in whom the faculty of visualization is strong my inner world must seemcuriously drab, limited and uninteresting. This was the world - a poor thing but my own - which Iexpected to see transformed into something completely unlike itself.The change which actually took place in that world was in no sense revolutionary. Half an hour afterswallowing the drug I became aware of a slow dance of golden lights. A little later there weresumptuous red surfaces swelling and expanding from bright nodes of energy that vibrated with acontinuously changing, patterned life. At another time the closing of my eyes revealed a complex of graystructures, within which pale bluish spheres kept emerging into intense solidity and, having emerged,would slide noiselessly upwards, out of sight. But at no time were there faces or forms of men oranimals. I saw no landscapes, no enormous spaces, no magical growth and metamorphosis of buildings,nothing remotely like a drama or a parable. The other world to which mescalin admitted me was not theworld of visions; it existed out there, in what I could see with my eyes open. The great change was inthe realm of objective fact. What had happened to my subjective universe was relatively unimportant.I took my pill at eleven. An hour and a half later, I was sitting in my study, looking intently at a smallglass vase. The vase contained only three flowers-a full-blown Belie of Portugal rose, shell pink with ahint at every petal's base of a hotter, flamier hue; a large magenta and cream-colored carnation; and,pale purple at the end of its broken stalk, the bold heraldic blossom of an iris. Fortuitous andprovisional, the little nosegay broke all the rules of traditional good taste. At breakfast that morning Ihad been struck by the lively dissonance of its colors. But that was no longer the point. I was notlooking now at an unusual flower arrangement. I was seeing what Adam had seen on the morning of hiscreation-the miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence.\"Is it agreeable?\" somebody asked. (During this Part of the experiment, all conversations wererecorded on a dictating machine, and it has been possible for me to refresh my memory of what wassaid.)\"Neither agreeable nor disagreeable,\" I answered. \"it just is.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5Istigkeit - wasn't that the word Meister Eckhart liked to use? \"Is-ness.\" The Being of Platonicphilosophy - except that Plate seems to have made the enormous, the grotesque mistake of separatingBeing from becoming and identifying it with the mathematical abstraction of the Idea. He could never,poor fellow, have seen a bunch of flowers shining with their own inner light and all but quivering underthe pressure of the significance with which they were charged; could never have perceived that whatrose and iris and carnation so intensely signified was nothing more, and nothing less, than what theywere - a transience that was yet eternal life, a perpetual perishing that was at the same time pure Being,a bundle of minute, unique particulars in which, by some unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, wasto be seen the divine source of all existence.I continued to look at the flowers, and in their living light I seemed to detect the qualitativeequivalent of breathing -but of a breathing without returns to a starting point, with no recurrent ebbs butonly a repeated flow from beauty to heightened beauty, from deeper to ever deeper meaning. Wordslike \"grace\" and \"transfiguration\" came to my mind, and this, of course, was what, among other things,they stood for. My eyes traveled from the rose to the carnation, and from that feathery incandescence tothe smooth scrolls of sentient amethyst which were the iris. The Beatific Vision, Sat Chit Ananda, Being-Awareness-Bliss-for the first time I understood, not on the verbal level, not by inchoate hints or at adistance, but precisely and completely what those prodigious syllables referred to. And then Iremembered a passage I had read in one of Suzuki's essays. \"What is the Dharma-Body of theBuddha?\" ('\"the Dharma-Body of the Buddha\" is another way of saying Mind, Suchness, the Void, theGodhead.) The question is asked in a Zen monastery by an earnest and bewildered novice. And withthe prompt irrelevance of one of the Marx Brothers, the Master answers, \"The hedge at the bottom ofthe garden.\" \"And the man who realizes this truth,\" the novice dubiously inquires, '\"what, may I ask, ishe?\" Groucho gives him a whack over the shoulders with his staff and answers, \"A golden-haired lion.\"It had been, when I read it, only a vaguely pregnant piece of nonsense. Now it was all as clear asday, as evident as Euclid. Of course the Dharma-Body of the Buddha was the hedge at the bottom ofthe garden. At the same time, and no less obviously, it was these flowers, it was anything that I - orrather the blessed Not-I, released for a moment from my throttling embrace - cared to look at. Thebooks, for example, with which my study walls were lined. Like the flowers, they glowed, when Ilooked at them, with brighter colors, a profounder significance. Red books, like rubies; emerald books;books bound in white jade; books of agate; of aquamarine, of yellow topaz; lapis lazuli books whosecolor was so intense, so intrinsically meaningful, that they seemed to be on the point of leaving theshelves to thrust themselves more insistently on my attention.\"What about spatial relationships?\" the investigator inquired, as I was looking at the books.It was difficult to answer. True, the perspective looked rather odd, and the walls of the room nolonger seemed to meet in right angles. But these were not the really important facts. The really importantfacts were that spatial relationships had ceased to matter very much and that my mind was perceivingthe world in terms of other than spatial categories. At ordinary times the eye concerns itself with suchproblems as Where? - How far? How situated in relation to what? In the mescalin experience theimplied questions to which the eye responds are of another order. Place and distance cease to be ofmuch interest. The mind does its Perceiving in terms of intensity of existence, profundity of significance,relationships within a pattern. I saw the books, but was not at all concerned with their positions inspace. What I noticed, what impressed itself upon my mind was the fact that all of them glowed withliving light and that in some the glory was more manifest than in others. In this context position and thethree dimensions were beside the point. Not, of course, that the category of space had been abolished.When I got up and walked about, I could do so quite normally, without misjudging the whereabouts of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6objects. Space was still there; but it had lost its predominance. The mind was primarily concerned, notwith measures and locations, but with being and meaning.And along with indifference to space there went an even more complete indifference to time. \"Thereseems to be plenty of it,\" was all I would answer, when the investigator asked me to say what I feltabout time. Plenty of it, but exactly how much was entirely irrelevant. I could, of course, have looked atmy watch; but my watch, I knew, was in another universe. My actual experience had been, was still, ofan indefinite duration or alternatively of a perpetual present made up of one continually changingapocalypse.From the books the investigator directed my attention to the furniture. A small typing table stood inthe center of the room; beyond it, from my point of view, was a wicker chair and beyond that a desk.The three pieces formed an intricate pattern of horizontals, uprights and diagonals - a pattern all themore interesting for not being interpreted in terms of spatial relationships. Table, chair and desk cametogether in a composition that was like something by Braque or Juan Gris, a still life recognizably relatedto the objective world, but rendered without depth, without any attempt at photographic realism. I waslooking at my furniture, not as the utilitarian who has to sit on chairs, to write at desks and tables, andnot as the cameraman or scientific recorder, but as the pure aesthete whose concern is only with formsand their relationships within the field of vision or the picture space. But as I looked, this purelyaesthetic, Cubist's-eye view gave place to what I can only describe as the sacramental vision of reality. Iwas back where I had been when I was looking at the flowers-back in a world where everything shonewith the Inner Light, and was infinite in its significance. The legs, for example, of that chair - howmiraculous their tubularity, how supernatural their polished smoothness! I spent several minutes - or wasit several centuries? - not merely gazing at those bamboo legs, but actually being them - or rather beingmyself in them; or, to be still more accurate (for \"I\" was not involved in the case, nor in a certain sensewere \"they\") being my Not-self in the Not-self which was the chair.Reflecting on my experience, I find myself agreeing with the eminent Cambridge philosopher, Dr. C.D. Broad, \"that we should do well to consider much more seriously than we have hitherto been inclinedto do the type of theory which Bergson put forward in connection with memory and sense perception.The suggestion is that the function of the brain and nervous system and sense organs is in the maineliminative and not productive. Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has everhappened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The functionof the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass oflargely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive orremember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to bepractically useful.\" According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind at Large. But in so faras we are animals, our business is at all costs to survive. To make biological survival possible, Mind atLarge has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes outat the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on thesurface of this Particular planet. To formulate and express the contents of this reduced awareness, manhas invented and endlessly elaborated those symbol-systems and implicit philosophies which we calllanguages. Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into whichhe has been born - the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the accumulated records ofother people's experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness isthe only awareness and as it bedevils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts fordata, his words for actual things. That which, in the language of religion, is called \"this world\" is theuniverse of reduced awareness, expressed, and, as it were, petrified by language. The various \"other"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7worlds,\" with which human beings erratically make contact are so many elements in the totality of theawareness belonging to Mind at Large. Most people, most of the time, know only what comes throughthe reducing valve and is consecrated as genuinely real by the local language. Certain persons, however,seem to be born with a kind of by-pass that circumvents the reducing valve. In others temporary by-passes may be acquired either spontaneously, or as the result of deliberate \"spiritual exercises,\" orthrough hypnosis, or by means of drugs. Through these permanent or temporary by-passes there flows,not indeed the perception \"of everything that is happening everywhere in the universe\" (for the by-passdoes not abolish the reducing valve, which still excludes the total content of Mind at Large), butsomething more than, and above ah something different from, the carefully selected utilitarian materialwhich our narrowed, individual minds regard as a complete, or at least sufficient, picture of reality.The brain is provided with a number of enzyme systems which serve to co-ordinate its workings.Some of these enzymes regulate the supply of glucose to the brain cells. Mescalin inhibits the productionof these enzymes and thus lowers the amount of glucose available to an organ that is in constant need ofsugar. When mescalin reduces the brain's normal ration of sugar what happens? Too few cases havebeen observed, and therefore a comprehensive answer cannot yet be given. But what happens to themajority of the few who have taken mescalin under supervision can be summarized as follows.The ability to remember and to \"think straight\" is little if at all reduced. (Listening to the recordingsof my conversation under the influence of the drug, I cannot discover that I was then any stupider than Iam at ordinary times.)Visual impressions are greatly intensified and the eye recovers some of the perceptual innocence ofchildhood, when the sensum was not immediately and automatically subordinated to the concept.Interest in space is diminished and interest in time falls almost to zero.Though the intellect remains unimpaired and though perception is enormously improved, the willsuffers a profound change for the worse. The mescalin taker sees no reason for doing anything inparticular and finds most of the causes for which, at ordinary times, he was prepared to act and suffer,profoundly uninteresting. He can't be bothered with them, for the good reason that he has better thingsto think about.These better things may be experienced (as I experienced them) \"out there,\" or \"in here,\" or in bothworlds, the inner and the outer, simultaneously or successively. That they are better seems to be self-evident to all mescalin takers who come to the drug with a sound liver and an untroubled mind.These effects of mescalin are the sort of effects you could expect to follow the administration of adrug having the power to impair the efficiency of the cerebral reducing valve. When the brain runs out ofsugar, the undernourished ego grows weak, can't be bothered to undertake the necessary chores, andloses all interest in those spatial and temporal relationships which mean so much to an organism bent ongetting on in the world. As Mind at Large seeps past the no longer watertight valve, all kinds ofbiologically useless things start to happen. In some cases there may be extra-sensory perceptions. Otherpersons discover a world of visionary beauty. To others again is revealed the glory, the infinite value andmeaningfulness of naked existence, of the given, unconceptualized event. In the final stage of egolessnessthere is an \"obscure knowledge\" that All is in all - that All is actually each. This is as near, I take it, as afinite mind can ever come to \"perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe.\"In this context, how significant is the enormous heightening, under mescalin, of the perception ofcolor! For certain animals it is biologically very important to be able to distinguish certain hues. Butbeyond the limits of their utilitarian spectrum, most creatures are completely color blind. Bees, forexample, spend most of their time \"deflowering the fresh virgins of the spring\"; but, as Von Frisch hasshown, they can recognize only a very few colors. Man's highly developed color sense is a biological"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8luxury - inestimably precious to him as an intellectual and spiritual being, but unnecessary to his survivalas an animal. To judge by the adjectives which Homer puts into their mouths, the heroes of the TrojanWar hardly excelled the bees in their capacity to distinguish colors. In this respect, at least, mankind'sadvance has been prodigious.Mescalin raises all colors to a higher power and makes the percipient aware of innumerable fineshades of difference, to which, at ordinary times, he is completely blind. It would seem that, for Mind atLarge, the so-called secondary characters of things are primary. Unlike Locke, it evidently feels thatcolors are more important, better worth attending to, than masses, positions and dimensions. Likemescalin takers, many mystics perceive supernaturally brilliant colors, not only with the inward eye, buteven in the objective world around them. Similar reports are made by psychics and sensitives. There arecertain mediums to whom the mescalin taker's brief revelation is a matter, during long periods, of dailyand hourly experience.From this long but indispensable excursion into the realm of theory, we may now return to themiraculous facts - four bamboo chair legs in the middle of a room. Like Wordsworth's daffodils, theybrought all manner of wealth - the gift, beyond price, of a new direct insight into the very Nature ofThings, together with a more modest treasure of understanding in the field, especially, of the arts. A roseis a rose is a rose. But these chair legs were chair legs were St. Michael and all angels. Four or fivehours after the event, when the effects of a cerebral sugar shortage were wearing off, I was taken for alittle tour of the city, which included a visit, towards sundown, to what is modestly claimed to be theWorld's Biggest Drug Store. At the back of the W.B.D.S., among the toys, the greeting cards and thecomics, stood a row, surprisingly enough, of art books. I picked up the first volume that came to hand.It was on Van Gogh, and the picture at which the book opened was \"The Chair\" - that astoundingportrait of a Ding an Sich, which the mad painter saw, with a kind of adoring terror, and tried to renderon his canvas. But it was a task to which the power even of genius proved wholly inadequate. The chairVan Gogh had seen was obviously the same in essence as the chair I had seen. But, thoughincomparably more real than the chairs of ordinary perception, the chair in his picture remained no morethan an unusually expressive symbol of the fact. The fact had been manifested Suchness; this was onlyan emblem. Such emblems are sources of true knowledge about the Nature of Things, and this trueknowledge may serve to prepare the mind which accepts it for immediate insights on its own account.But that is all. However expressive, symbols can never be the things they stand for.It would be interesting, in this context, to make a study of the works of art available to the greatknowers of Suchness. What sort of pictures did Eckhart look at? What sculptures and paintings playeda part in the religious experience of St. John of the Cross, of Hakuin, of Hui-neng, of William Law? Thequestions are beyond my power to answer; but I strongly suspect that most of the great knowers ofSuchness paid very little attention to art - some refusing to have anything to do with it at all, others beingcontent with what a critical eye would regard as second-rate, or even, tenth-rate, works. (To a personwhose transfigured and transfiguring mind can see the All in every this, the first-rateness or tenth-rateness of even a religious painting will be a matter of the most sovereign indifference.) Art, I suppose,is only for beginners, or else for those resolute dead-enders, who have made up their minds to becontent with the ersatz of Suchness, with symbols rather than with what they signify, with the elegantlycomposed recipe in lieu of actual dinner. I returned the Van Gogh to its rack and picked up the volumestanding next to it. It was a book on Botticelli. I turned the pages. \"The Birth of Venus\"-never one of myfavorites. \"Mars and Venus,\" that loveliness so passionately denounced by poor Ruskin at the height ofhis long-drawn sexual tragedy. The marvelously rich and intricate \"Calumny of Apelles.\" And then asomewhat less familiar and not very good picture, \"Judith.\" My attention was arrested and I gazed in"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9fascination, not at the pale neurotic heroine or her attendant, not at the victim's hairy head or the vernallandscape in the background, but at the purplish silk of Judith's pleated bodice and long wind-blownskirts.This was something I had seen before-seen that very morning, between the flowers and thefurniture, when I looked down by chance, and went on passionately staring by choice, at my owncrossed legs. Those folds in the trousers - what a labyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And thetexture of the gray flannel - how rich, how deeply, mysteriously sumptuous! And here they were again,in Botticelli's picture.Civilized human beings wear clothes, therefore there can be no portraiture, no mythological orhistorical storytelling without representations of folded textiles. But though it may account for the origins,mere tailoring can never explain the luxuriant development of drapery as a major theme of all the plasticarts. Artists, it is obvious, have always loved drapery for its own sake - or, rather, for their own. Whenyou paint or carve drapery, you are painting or carving forms which, for all practical purposes, are non-representational-the kind of unconditioned forms on which artists even in the most naturalistic traditionlike to let themselves go. In the average Madonna or Apostle the strictly human, fully representationalelement accounts for about ten per cent of the whole. All the rest consists of many colored variations onthe inexhaustible theme of crumpled wool or linen. And these non-representational nine-tenths of aMadonna or an Apostle may be just as important qualitatively as they are in quantity. Very often theyset the tone of the whole work of art, they state the key in which the theme is being rendered, theyexpress the mood, the temperament, the attitude to life of the artist. Stoical serenity reveals itself in thesmooth surfaces, the broad untortured folds of Piero's draperies. Torn between fact and wish, betweencynicism and idealism, Bernini tempers the all but caricatural verisimilitude of his faces with enormoussartorial abstractions, which are the embodiment, in stone or bronze, of the everlasting commonplacesof rhetoric - the heroism, the holiness, the sublimity to which mankind perpetually aspires, for the mostpart in vain. And here are El Greco's disquietingly visceral skirts and mantles; here are the sharp,twisting, flame-like folds in which Cosimo Tura clothes his figures: in the first, traditional spiritualitybreaks down into a nameless physiological yearning; in the second, there writhes an agonized sense ofthe world's essential strangeness and hostility. Or consider Watteau; his men and women play lutes, getready for balls and harlequinades, embark, on velvet lawns and under noble trees, for the Cythera ofevery lover's dream; their enormous melancholy and the flayed, excruciating sensibility of their creatorfind expression, not in the actions recorded, not in the gestures and the faces portrayed, but in the reliefand texture of their taffeta skirts, their satin capes and doublets. Not an inch of smooth surface here, nota moment of peace or confidence, only a silken wilderness of countless tiny pleats and wrinkles, with anincessant modulation - inner uncertainty rendered with the perfect assurance of a master hand - of toneinto tone, of one indeterminate color into another. In life, man proposes, God disposes. In the plasticarts the proposing is done by the subject matter; that which disposes is ultimately the artist'stemperament, proximately (at least in portraiture, history and genre) the carved or painted drapery.Between them, these two may decree that a fete galante shall move to tears, that a crucifixion shall beserene to the point of cheerfulness, that a stigmatization shall be almost intolerably sexy, that the likenessof a prodigy of female brainlessness (I am thinking now of Ingres' incomparable Mme. Moitessier) shallexpress the austerest, the most uncompromising intellectuality.But this is not the whole story. Draperies, as I had now discovered, are much more than devices forthe introduction of non-representational forms into naturalistic paintings and sculptures. What the rest ofus see only under the influence of mescalin, the artist is congenitally equipped to see all the time. Hisperception is not limited to what is biologically or socially useful. A little of the knowledge belonging to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10Mind at Large oozes past the reducing valve of brain and ego, into his consciousness. It is a knowledgeof the intrinsic significance of every existent. For the artist as for the mescalin taker draperies are livinghieroglyphs that stand in some peculiarly expressive way for the unfathomable mystery of pure being.More even than the chair, though less perhaps than those wholly supernatural flowers, the folds of mygray flannel trousers were charged with \"is-ness.\" To what they owed this privileged status, I cannot say.Is it, perhaps, because the forms of folded drapery are so strange and dramatic that they catch the eyeand in this way force the miraculous fact of sheer existence upon the attention? Who knows? What isimportant is less the reason for the experience than the experience itself. Poring over Judith's skirts,there in the World's Biggest Drug Store, I knew that Botticelli - and not Botticelli alone, but many otherstoo-had looked at draperies with the same transfigured and transfiguring eyes as had been mine thatmorning. They had seen the Istigkeit, the Allness and Infinity of folded cloth and had done their best torender it in paint or stone. Necessarily, of course, without success. For the glory and the wonder ofpure existence belong to another order, beyond the Power of even the highest art to express. But inJudith's skirt I could clearly see what, if I had been a painter of genius, I might have made of my oldgray flannels. Not much, heaven knows, in comparison with the reality, but enough to delight generationafter generation of beholders, enough to make them understand at least a little of the true significance ofwhat, in our pathetic imbecility, we call \"mere things\" and disregard in favor of television.\"This is how one ought to see,\" I kept saying as I looked down at my trousers, or glanced at thejeweled books in the shelves, at the legs of my infinitely more than Van-Goghian chair. \"This is how oneought to see, how things really are.\" And yet there were reservations. For if one always saw like this,one would never want to do anything else. Just looking, just being the divine Not-self of flower, ofbook, of chair, of flannel. That would be enough. But in that case what about other people? What abouthuman relations? In the recording of that morning's conversations I find the question constantly repeated,\"What about human relations?\" How could one reconcile this timeless bliss of seeing as one ought to seewith the temporal duties of doing what one ought to do and feeling as one ought to feel? \"One ought tobe able,\" I said, \"to see these trousers as infinitely important and human beings as still more infinitelyimportant.\" One ought-but in practice it seemed to be impossible. This participation in the manifest gloryof things left no room, so to speak, for the ordinary, the necessary concerns of human existence, aboveall for concerns involving persons. For Persons are selves and, in one respect at least, I was now a Not-self, simultaneously perceiving and being the Not-self of the things around me. To this new-born Not-self, the behavior, the appearance, the very thought of the self it had momentarily ceased to be, and ofother selves, its one-time fellows, seemed not indeed distasteful (for distastefulness was not one of thecategories in terms of which I was thinking), but enormously irrelevant. Compelled by the investigator toanalyze and report on what I was doing (and how I longed to be left alone with Eternity in a flower,Infinity in four chair legs and the Absolute in the folds of a pair of flannel trousers!), I realized that I wasdeliberately avoiding the eyes of those who were with me in the room, deliberately refraining from beingtoo much aware of them. One was my wife, the other a man I respected and greatly liked; but bothbelonged to the world from which, for the moment, mescalin had delivered me \"e world of selves, oftime, of moral judgments and utilitarian considerations, the world (and it was this aspect of human lifewhich I wished, above all else, to forget) of self-assertion, of cocksureness, of overvalued words andidolatrously worshiped notions.At this stage of the proceedings I was handed a large colored reproduction of the well-known self-portrait by C6zanne-the head and shoulders of a man in a large straw hat, red-cheeked, red-lipped,with rich black whiskers and a dark unfriendly eye. It is a magnificent painting; but it was not as apainting that I now saw it. For the head promptly took on a third dimension and came to life as a small"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11goblin-like man looking out through a window in the page before me. I started to laugh. And when theyasked me why, \"What pretensions!\" I kept repeating. \"Who on earth does he think he is?\" The questionwas not addressed to Cezanne in particular, but to the human species at large. Who did they all thinkthey were?\"It's like Arnold Bennett in the Dolomites,\" I said, suddenly remembering a scene, happilyimmortalized in a snapshot, of A.B., some four or five years before his death, toddling along a wintryroad at Cortina d'Ampezzo. Around him lay the virgin snow; in the background was a more than gothicaspiration of red crags. And there was dear, kind, unhappy A.B., consciously overacting the role of hisfavorite character in fiction, himself, the Card in person. There he went, toddling slowly in the brightAlpine sunshine, his thumbs in the armholes of a yellow waistcoat which bulged, a little lower down, withthe graceful curve of a Regency bow window at Brighton - his head thrown back as though to aim somestammered utterance, howitzer-like, at the blue dome of heaven. What he actually said, I have forgotten;but what his whole manner, air and posture fairly shouted was, \"I'm as good as those damnedmountains.\" And in some ways, of course, he was infinitely better; but not, as he knew very well, in theway his favorite character in fiction liked to imagine.Successfully (whatever that may mean) or unsuccessfully, we all overact the part of our favoritecharacter in fiction. And the fact, the almost infinitely unlikely fact, of actually being Cezanne makes nodifference. For the consummate painter, with his little pipeline to Mind at Large by-passing the brainvalve and ego-filter, was also and just as genuinely this whiskered goblin with the unfriendly eye. Forrelief I turned back to the folds in my trousers. \"This is how one ought to see,\" I repeated yet again. AndI might have added,' 'These are the sort of things one ought to look at.\" Things without pretensions,satisfied to be merely themselves, sufficient in their Suchness, not acting a part, not trying, insanely, to goit alone, in isolation from the Dharma-Body, in Luciferian defiance of the grace of god.\"The nearest approach to this,\" I said, \"would be a Vermeer.\"Yes, a Vermeer. For that mysterious artist was truly gifted-with the vision that perceives theDharma-Body as the hedge at the bottom of the garden, with the talent to render as much of that visionas the limitations of human capacity permit, and with the prudence to confine himself in his paintings tothe more manageable aspects of reality; for though Vermeer represented human beings, he was alwaysa painter of still life. Cezanne, who told his female sitters to do their best to look like apples, tried topaint portraits in the same spirit. But his pippin-like women are more nearly related to Plato's Ideas thanto the Dharma-Body in the hedge. They are Eternity and Infinity seen, not in sand or flower, but in theabstractions of some very superior brand of geometry. Vermeer never asked his girls to look likeapples. On the contrary, he insisted on their being girls to the very limit - but always with the provisothat they refrain from behaving girlishly. They might sit or quietly stand but never giggle, never displayself-consciousness, never say their prayers or pine for absent sweethearts, never gossip, never gazeenviously at other women's babies, never dirt, never love or hate or work. In the act of doing any ofthese things they would doubtless become more intensely themselves, but would cease, for that veryreason, to manifest their divine essential Not-self. In Blake's phrase, the doors of Vermeer's perceptionwere only partially cleansed. A single panel had become almost perfectly transparent; the rest of thedoor was still muddy. The essential Not-self could be perceived very clearly in things and in livingcreatures on the hither side of good and evil. In human beings it was visible only when they were inrepose, their minds untroubled, their bodies motionless. In these circumstances Vermeer could seeSuchness in all its heavenly beauty - could see and, in some small measure, render it-in a subtle andsumptuous still life. Vermeer is undoubtedly the greatest painter of human still lives. But there have beenothers, for example, Vermeer's French contemporaries, the Le Nain brothers. They set out, I suppose,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12to be genre painters; but what they actually produced was a series of human still lives, in which theircleansed perception of the infinite significance of all things is rendered not, as with Vermeer, by subtleenrichment of color and texture, but by a heightened clarity, an obsessive distinctness of form, within anaustere, almost monochromatic tonality. In our own day we have had Vuillard, the painter, at his best, ofunforgettably splendid pictures of the Dharma-Body manifested in a bourgeois bedroom, of theAbsolute blazing away in the midst of some stockbroker's family in a suburban garden, taking tea.Ce qui fait que I'ancien bandagiste renieLe compioir dont le faste alléchait les passants,C'est son jardin d'Auteuil, ou, veufs de tout encens,Les Zinnias ont I'air d'être en tôle vernie.For Laurent Tailhade the spectacle was merely obscene. But if the retired rubber goods merchanthad sat still enough, Vuillard would have seen in him only the Dharma-Body, would have painted, in thezinnias, the goldfish pool, the villa's Moorish tower and Chinese lanterns, a corner of Eden before theFall.But meanwhile my question remained unanswered. How was this cleansed perception to bereconciled with a proper concern with human relations, with the necessary chores and duties, to saynothing of charity and practical compassion? The age-old debate between the actives and thecontemplatives was being renewed - renewed, so far as I was concerned, with an unprecedentedpoignancy. For until this morning I had known contemplation only in its humbler, its more ordinary forms- as discursive thinking; as a rapt absorption in poetry or painting or music; as a patient waiting uponthose inspirations, without which even the prosiest writer cannot hope to accomplish anything; asoccasional glimpses, in Nature, of Wordsworth's \"something far more deeply interfused\"; as systematicsilence leading, sometimes, to hints of an \"obscure knowledge.\" But now I knew contemplation at itsheight. At its height, but not yet in its fullness. For in its fullness the way of Mary includes the way ofMartha and raises it, so to speak, to its own higher power. Mescalin opens up the way of Mary, butshuts the door on that of Martha. It gives access to contemplation - but to a contemplation that isincompatible with action and even with the will to action, the very thought of action. In the intervalsbetween his revelations the mescalin taker is apt to feel that, though in one way everything is supremelyas it should be, in another there is something wrong. His problem is essentially the same as that whichconfronts the quietist, the arhat and, on another level, the landscape painter and the painter of human stilllives. Mescalin can never solve that problem; it can only pose it, apocalyptically, for those to whom ithad never before presented itself. The full and final solution can be found only by those who areprepared to implement the right kind of Welranschauung by means of the right kind of behavior and theright kind of constant and unstrained alertness. Over against the quietist stands the active-contemplative,the saint, the man who, in Eckhart's phrase, is ready to come down from the seventh heaven in order tobring a cup of water to his sick brother. Over against the arhat, retreating from ap- pearances into anentirely transcendental Nirvana, stands the Bodhisattva, for whom Suchness and the world ofcontingencies are one, and for whose boundless compassion every one of those contingencies is anoccasion not only for transfiguring insight, but also for the most practical charity. And in the universe ofart, over against Vermeer and the other Painters of human still lives, over against the masters of Chineseand Japanese landscape painting, over against Constable and Turner, against Sisley and Seurat andCezanne, stands the all-inclusive art of Rembrandt. These are enormous names, inaccessible eminences.For myself, on this memorable May morning, I could only be grateful for an experience which had"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13shown me, more clearly than I had ever seen it before, the true nature of the challenge and thecompletely liberating response.Let me add, before we leave this subject, that there is no form of contemplation, even the mostquietistic, which is without its ethical values. Half at least of all morality is negative and consists inkeeping out of mischief. The Lord's Prayer is less than fifty words long, and six of those words aredevoted to asking God not to lead us into temptation. The one-sided contemplative leaves undone manythings that he ought to do; but to make up for it, he refrains from doing a host of things he ought not todo. The sum of evil, Pascal remarked, would be much diminished if men could only learn to sit quietly intheir rooms. The contemplative whose perception has been cleansed does not have to stay in his room.He can go about his business, so completely satisfied to see and be a part of the divine Order of Thingsthat he will never even be tempted to indulge in what Traherne called \"the dirty Devices of the world.\"When we feel ourselves to be sole heirs of the universe, when \"the sea flows in our veins ... and the starsare our jewels,\" when all things are perceived as infinite and holy, what motive can we have forcovetousness or self-assertion, for the pursuit of power or the drearier forms of pleasure?Contemplatives are not likely to become gamblers, or procurers, or drunkards; they do not as a rulepreach intolerance, or make war; do not find it necessary to rob, swindle or grind the faces of the poor.And to these enormous negative virtues we may add another which, though hard to define, is bothpositive and important. The arhat and the quietist may not practice contemplation in its fullness; but ifthey practice it at all, they may bring back enlightening reports of another, a transcendent country of themind; and if they practice it in the height, they will become conduits through which some beneficentinfluence can how out of that other country into a world of darkened selves, chronically dying for lack ofit.Meanwhile I had turned, at the investigator's request, from the portrait of Cezanne to what wasgoing on, inside my head, when I shut my eyes. This time, the inscape was curiously unrewarding. Thefield of vision was filled with brightly colored, constantly changing structures that seemed to be made ofplastic or enameled tin.\"Cheap,\" I commented. \"Trivial. Like things in a five-and-ten.\" And all this shoddiness existed in aclosed, cramped universe. \"It's as though one were below decks in a ship,\" I said. \"A five-and-ten-centship.\" And as I looked, it became very clear that this five-and-ten-cent ship was in some way connectedwith human pretensions, with the portrait of Cezanne, with A.B. among the Dolomites overacting hisfavorite character in fiction. This suffocating interior of a dime-store ship was my own personal self;these gimcrack mobiles of tin and plastic were my personal contributions to the universe. I felt the lessonto be salutary, but was sorry, none the less, that it had had to be administered at this moment and in thisform. As a rule the mescalin taker discovers an inner world as manifestly a datum, as self-evidently\"infinite and holy,\" as that transfgured outer world which I had seen with my eyes open. From the first,my own case had been different. Mescalin had endowed me temporarily with the power to see thingswith my eyes shut; but it could not, or at least on this occasion did not, reveal an inscape remotelycomparable to my flowers or chair or flannels \"out there.\" What it had allowed me to perceive insidewas not the Dharma-Body, in images, but my own mind; not Suchness, but a set of symbols - in otherwords, a homemade substitute for Suchness.Most visualizers are transformed by mescalin into visionaries. Some of them - and they are Perhapsmore numerous than is generally supposed - require no transformation; they are visionaries all the time.The mental species to which Blake belonged is fairly widely distributed even in the urban-industrialsocieties of the present day. The poet-artist's uniqueness does not consist in the fact that (to quote fromhis Descriptive Catalogue) he actually saw \"those wonderful originals called in the Sacred Scriptures the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14Cherubim.\" It does not consist in the fact that \"these wonderful originals seen in my visions, were someof them one hundred feet in height ... all containing mythological and recondite meaning.\" It consistssolely in his ability to render, in words or (somewhat less successfully) in line and color, some hint atleast of a not excessively uncommon experience. The untalented visionary may perceive an inner realityno less tremendous, beautiful and significant than the world beheld by Blake; but he lacks altogether theability to express, in literary or plastic symbols, what he has seen.From the records of religion and the surviving menuments of poetry and the plastic arts it is veryplain that, at most times and in most places, men have attached more importance to the inscape than toobjective existents, have felt that what they saw with their eyes shut possessed a spiritually highersignificance than what they saw with their eyes open. The reason? Familiarity breeds contempt, and howto survive is a problem ranging in urgency from the chronically tedious to the excruciating. The outerworld is what we wake up to every morning of our lives, is the place where, willy-nilly, we must try tomake our living. In the inner world there is neither work nor monotony. We visit it only in dreams andmusings, and its strangeness is such that we never find the same world on two successive occasions.What wonder, then, if human beings in their search for the divine have generally preferred to lookwithin! Generally, but not always. In their art no less than in their religion, the Taoists and the ZenBuddhists looked beyond visions to the Void, and through the Void at \"the ten thousand things\" ofobjective reality. Because of their doctrine of the Word made flesh, Christians should have been able,from the first, to adopt a similar attitude towards the universe around them. But because of the doctrineof the Fall, they found it very hard to do so. As recently as three hundred years ago an expression ofthoroughgoing world denial and even world condemnation was both orthodox and comprehensible.\"We should feel wonder at nothing at all in Nature except only the Incarnation of Christ.\" In theseventeenth century, Lallemant's phrase seemed to make sense. Today it has the ring of madness.In China the rise of landscape painting to the rank of a major art form took place about a thousand,in Japan about six hundred and in Europe about three hundred, years ago. The equation of Dharma-Body with hedge was made by those Zen Masters, who wedded Taoist naturalism with Buddhisttranscendentalism. It was, therefore, only in the Far East that landscape painters consciously regardedtheir art as religious. In the West religious painting was a matter of portraying sacred personages, ofillustrating hallowed texts. Landscape painters regarded themselves as secularists. Today we recognizein Seurat one of the supreme masters of what may be called mystical landscape painting. And yet thisman who was able, more effectively than any other, to render the One in the many, became quiteindignant when somebody praised him for the \"poetry\" of his work. '1 merely apply the System,\" heprotested. In other words he was merely a pointilliste and, in his own eyes, nothing else. A similaranecdote is told of John Constable. One day towards the end of his life, Blake met Constable atHampstead and was shown one of the younger artist's sketches. In spite of his contempt for naturalisticart, the old visionary knew a good thing when be saw it-except of course, when it was by Rubens. 'Thisis not drawing,\" he cried, \"this is inspiration!\" \"I had meant it to be drawing,\" was Constable'scharacteristic answer. Both men were right. It was drawing, precise and veracious, and at the same timeit was inspiration - inspiration of an order at least as high as Blake's. The pine trees on the Heath hadactually been seen as identical with the Dharma-Body. The sketch was a rendering, necessarilyimperfect but still profoundly impressive, of what a cleansed perception had revealed to the open eyesof a great painter. From a contemplation, in the tradition of Wordsworth and Whitman, of the Dharma-Body as hedge, and from visions, such as Blake's, of the \"wonderful originals\" within the mind,contemporary poets have retreated into an investigation of the personal, as opposed to the more thanpersonal, subconscious and to a rendering, in highly abstract terms, not of the given, objective fact, but"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15of mere scientific and theological notions. And something similar has happened in the held of painting,where we have witnessed a general retreat from landscape, the predominant art form of the nineteenthcentury. This retreat from landscape has not been into that other, inner divine Datum, with which most ofthe traditional schools of the past were concerned, that Archetypal World, where men have alwaysfound the raw materials of myth and religion. No, it has been a retreat from the outward Datum into thepersonal subconscious, into a mental world more squalid and more tightly closed than even the world ofconscious personality. These contraptions of tin and highly colored plastic - where had I seen thembefore? In every picture gallery that exhibits the latest in nonrepresentational art. And now someoneproduced a phonograph and put a record on the turntable. I listened with pleasure, but experiencednothing comparable to my seen apocalypses of flowers or flannel. Would a naturally gifted musician hearthe revelations which, for me, had been exclusively visual? It would be interesting to make theexperiment. Meanwhile, though not transfigured, though retaining its normal quality and intensity, themusic contributed not a little to my understanding of what had happened to me and of the widerproblems which those happenings had raised.Instrumental music, oddly enough, left me rather cold. Mozart's C-Minor Piano Concerto wasinterrupted after the first movement, and a recording of some madrigals by Gesualdo took its place.\"These voices,\" I said appreciatively, \"these voices - they're a kind of bridge back to the humanworld.\" And a bridge they remained even while singing the most startlingly chromatic of the mad prince'scompositions. Through the uneven phrases of the madrigals, the music pursued its course, never stickingto the same key for two bars together. In Gesualdo, that fantastic character out of a Webstermelodrama, psychological disintegration had exaggerated, had pushed to the extreme limit, a tendencyinherent in modal as opposed to fully tonal music. The resulting works sounded as though they mighthave been written by the later Schoenberg.\"And yet,\" I felt myself constrained to say, as I listened to these strange products of a Counter-Reformation psychosis working upon a late medieval art form, \"and yet it does not matter that he's all inbits. The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a HigherOrder. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the brokenpieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren't lulled intoa sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on yourimmediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages.But of course it's dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn't get back, out of the chaos ...\"From Gesualdo's madrigals we jumped, across a gulf of three centuries, to Alban Berg and theLyric Suire. \"This\" I announced in advance, \"is going to be hell.\"But, as it turned out, I was wrong. Actually the music sounded rather funny. Dredged up from thepersonal subconscious, agony succeeded twelve-tone agony; but what struck me was only the essentialincongruity between a psychological disintegration even completer than Gesualdo's and the prodigiousresources, in talent and technique, employed in its expression.\"Isn't he sorry for himself!\" I commented with a derisive lack of sympathy. And then, \"Katzenmusik- learned Katzenmusik.\" And finally, after a few more minutes of the anguish, \"Who cares what hisfeelings are? Why can't he pay attention to something else?\" As a criticism of what is undoubtedly a veryremarkable work, it was unfair and inadequate - but not, I think, irrelevant. I cite it for what it is worthand because that is how, in a state of pure contemplation, I reacted to the Lyric Suite.When it was over, the investigator suggested a walk in the garden. I was willing; and though mybody seemed to have dissociated itself almost completely from my mind - or, to be more accurate,though my awareness of the transfigured outer world was no longer accompanied by an awareness of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16my physical organism -I found myself able to get up, open the French window and walk out with only aminimum of hesitation. It was odd, of course, to feel that \"I\" was not the same as these arms and legs\"out there,\" as this wholly objective trunk and neck and even head. It was odd; but one soon got usedto it. And anyhow the body seemed perfectly well able to look after itself. In reality, of course, it alwaysdoes look after itself. All that the conscious ego can do is to formulate wishes, which are then carriedout by forces which it controls very little and understands not at all. When it does anything more -whenit tries too hard, for example, when it worries, when it becomes apprehensive about the future -it lowersthe effectiveness of those forces and may even cause the devitalized body to fall ill. In my present state,awareness was not referred to as ego; it was, so to speak, on its own. This meant that the physiologicalintelligence controlling the body was also on its own. For the moment that interfering neurotic who, inwaking hours, tries to run the show, was blessedly out of the way.From the French window I walked out under a kind of pergola covered in part by a climbing rosetree, in part by laths, one inch wide with half an inch of space be tween them. The sun was shining andthe shadows of the laths made a zebra-like pattern on the ground and across the seat and back of agarden chair, which was standing at this end of the pergola. That chair -shall I ever forget it? Where theshadows fell on the canvas upholstery, stripes of a deep but glowing indigo alternated with stripes of anincandescence so intensely bright that it was hard to believe that they could be made of anything butblue fire. For what seemed an immensely long time I gazed without knowing, even without wishing toknow, what it was that confronted me. At any other time I would have seen a chair barred with alternatelight and shade. Today the percept had swallowed up the concept. I was so completely absorbed inlooking, so thunderstruck by what I actually saw, that I could not be aware of anything else. Gardenfurniture, laths, sunlight, shadow - these were no more than names and notions, mere verbalizations, forutilitarian or scientific purposes, after the event. The event was this succession of azure furnace doorsseparated by gulfs of unfathomable gentian. It was inexpressibly wonderful, wonderful to the point,almost, of being terrifying. And suddenly I had an inkling of what it must feel like to be mad.Schizophrenia has its heavens as well as its hells and purgatories. I remember what an old friend, deadthese many years, told me about his mad wife. One day in the early stages of the disease, when she stillhad her lucid intervals he had gone to talk to her about their children. She listened for a time, then cuthim short. How could he bear to waste his time on a couple of absent children, when all that reallymattered, here and now, was the unspeakable beauty of the patterns he made, in this brown tweedjacket, every time he moved his arms? Alas, this Paradise of cleansed perception, of pure one-sidedcontemplation, was not to endure. The blissful intermissions became rarer, became briefer, until finallythere were no more of them; there was only horror.Most takers of mescalin experience only the heavenly part of schizophrenia. The drug brings helland purgatory only to those who have had a recent case of jaundice, or who suffer from periodicaldepressions or a chronic anxiety. If, like the other drugs of remotely comparable power, mescalin werenotoriously toxic, the taking of it would be enough, of itself, to cause anxiety. But the reasonably healthyperson knows in advance that, so far as he is concerned, mescalin is completely innocuous, that itseffects will pass off after eight or ten hours, leaving no hangover and consequently no craving for arenewal of the dose. Fortified by this knowledge, he embarks upon the experiment without fear - inother words, without any disposition to convert an unprecedentedly strange and other than humanexperience into something appalling, something actually diabolical.Confronted by a chair which looked like the Last Judgment - or, to be more accurate, by a LastJudgment which, after a long time and with considerable difficulty, I recognized as a chair - I foundmyself all at once on the brink of panic. This, I suddenly felt, was going too far. Too far, even though the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17going was into intenser beauty, deeper significance. The fear, as I analyze it in retrospect, was of beingoverwhelmed, of disintegrating under a pressure of reality greater than a mind, accustomed to livingmost of the time in a cosy world of symbols, could possibly bear. The literature of religious experienceabounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, faceto face with some manifestation of the Mysterium tremendum. In theological language, this fear is due tothe in- compatibility between man's egotism and the divine purity, between man's self-aggravatedseparateness and the infinity of God. Following Boehme and William Law, we may say that, byunregenerate souls, the divine Light at its full blaze can be apprehended only as a burning, purgatorialfire. An almost identical doctrine is to be found in The Tibetan Book of the Dead, where the departedsoul is described as shrinking in agony from the Pure Light of the Void, and even from the lesser,tempered Lights, in order to rush headlong into the comforting darkness of selfhood as a reborn humanbeing, or even as a beast, an unhappy ghost, a denizen of hell. Anything rather than the burningbrightness of unmitigated Reality - anything!The schizophrenic is a soul not merely unregenerate, but desperately sick into the bargain. Hissickness consists in the inability to take refuge from inner and outer reality (as the sane person habituallydoes) in the homemade universe of common sense - the strictly human world of useful notions, sharedsymbols and socially acceptable conventions. The schizophrenic is like a man permanently under theinfluence of mescalin, and therefore unable to shut off the experience of a reality which he is not holyenough to live with, which he cannot explain away because it is the most stubborn of primary facts, andwhich, because it never permits him to look at the world with merely human eyes, scares him intointerpreting its unremitting strangeness, its burning intensity of significance, as the manifestations ofhuman or even cosmic malevolence, calling for the most desperate countermeasures, from murderousviolence at one end of the scale to catatonia, or psychological suicide, at the other. And once embarkedupon the downward, the infernal road, one would never be able to stop. That, now, was only tooobvious.\"If you started in the wrong way,\" I said in answer to the investigator's questions, \"everything thathappened would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would all be self-validating, You couldn'tdraw a breath without knowing it was part of the plot.\" \"So you think you know where madness lies?\"My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, \"Yes.\"\"And you couldn't control it?\"\"No I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have togo on to the conclusion.\" \"Would you be able,\" my wife asked, \"to fix your attention on what TheTibetan Book of The Dead calls the Clear Light?\" I was doubtful.\"Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?\"I considered the question for some time. \"Perhaps,\" I answered at last, \"perhaps I could - but only ifthere were somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's thepoint, I suppose, of the Tibetan ritual - someone sitting there all the time and telling you what's what.\"After listening to the record of this part of the experiment, I took down my copy of Evans-Wentz'sedition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and opened at random. \"O nobly born, let not thy mind bedistracted.\" That was the problem - to remain undistracted. Undistracted by the memory of past sins, byimagined pleasure, by the bitter aftertaste of old wrongs and humiliations, by all the fears and hates andcravings that ordinarily eclipse the Light. What those Buddhist monks did for the dying and the dead,might not the modern psychiatrist do for the insane? Let there be a voice to assure them, by day andeven while they are asleep, that in spite of all the terror, all the bewilderment and confusion, the ultimateReality remains unshakably itself and is of the same substance as the inner light of even the most cruelly"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18tormented mind. By means of such devices as recorders, clock-controlled switches, public addresssystems and pillow speakers it should be very easy to keep the inmates of even an understaffedinstitution constantly reminded of this primordial fact. Perhaps a few of the lost souls might in this way behelped to win some measure of control over the universe - at once beautiful and appalling, but alwaysother than human, always totally incomprehensible - in which they find themselves condemned to live.None too soon, I was steered away from the disquieting splendors of my garden chair. Drooping ingreen parabolas from the hedge, the ivy fronds shone with a kind of glassy, jade-like radiance. Amoment later a clump of Red Hot Pokers, in full bloom, had exploded into my field of vision. Sopassionately alive that they seemed to be standing on the very brink of utterance, the flowers strainedupwards into the blue. Like the chair under the laths, they protected too much. I looked down at theleaves and discovered a cavernous intricacy of the most delicate green lights and shadows, pulsing withundecipherable mystery.Roses : The flowers are easy to paint, The leaves difficult.Shiki's haiku (which I quote in R. H. Blyth's translation) expresses, by indirection, exactly what Ithen felt - the excessive, the too obvious glory of the flowers, as contrasted with the subtler miracle oftheir foliage.We walked out into the street. A large pale blue automobile was standing at the curb. At the sightof it, I was suddenly overcome by enormous merriment. What complacency, what an absurd self-satisfaction beamed from those bulging surfaces of glossiest enamel! Man had created the thing in hisown image - or rather in the image of his favorite character in fiction. I laughed till the tears ran down mycheeks.We re-entered the house. A meal had been prepared. Somebody, who was not yet identical withmyself, fell to with ravenous appetite. From a considerable distance and without much interest, I lookedon.When the meal had been eaten, we got into the car and went for a drive. The effects of the mescalinwere already on the decline: but the flowers in the gardens still trembled on the brink of beingsupernatural, the pepper trees and carobs along the side streets still manifestly belonged to some sacredgrove. Eden alternated with Dodona. Yggdrasil with the mystic Rose. And then, abruptly, we were at anintersection, waiting to cross Sunset Boulevard. Before us the cars were rolling by in a steady stream -thousands of them, all bright and shiny like an advertiser's dream and each more ludicrous than the last.Once again I was convulsed with laughter. The Red Sea of traffic parted at last, and we crossed intoanother oasis of trees and lawns and roses. In a few minutes we had climbed to a vantage point in thehills, and there was the city spread out beneath us. Rather disappointingly, it looked very like the city Ihad seen on other occasions. So far as I was concerned, transfiguration was proportional to distance.The nearer, the more divinely other. This vast, dim panorama was hardly different from itself.We drove on, and so long as we remained in the hills, with view succeeding distant view,significance was at its everyday level, well below transfiguration point. The magic began to work againonly when we turned down into a new suburb and were gliding between two rows of houses. Here, inspite of the peculiar hideousness of the architecture, there were renewals of transcendental otherness,hints of the morning's heaven. Brick chimneys and green composition roofs glowed in the sunshine, likefragments of the New Jerusalem. And all at once I saw what Guardi had seen and (with whatincomparable skill) had so often rendered in his paintings- a stucco wall with a shadow slanting across it,blank but unforgettably beautiful, empty but charged with all the meaning and the mystery of existence.The revelation dawned and was gone again within a fraction of a second. The car had moved on; timewas uncovering another manifestation of the eternal Suchness. \"Within sameness there is difference. But"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19that difference should be different from sameness is in no wise the intention of all the Buddhas. Theirintention is both totality and differentiation.\" This bank of red and white geraniums, for example-it wasentirely different from that stucco wall a hundred yards up the road. But the \"is-ness\" of both was thesame, the eternal quality of their transience was the same.An hour later, with ten more miles and the visit to the World's Biggest Drug Store safely behind us,we were back at home, and I had returned to that reassuring but profoundly unsatisfactory state knownas \"being in one's right mind.\" That humanity at large will ever be able to dispense with ArtificialParadises seems very unlikely. Most men and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best somonotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to transcend themselves if only for afew moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul. Art and religion,carnivals and saturnalia, dancing and listening to oratory -all these have served, in H. G. Wells's phrase,as Doors in the Wall. And for private, far everyday use there have always been chemical intoxicants. Allthe vegetable sedatives and narcotics, all the euphorics that grow on trees, the hallucinogens that ripen inberries or can be squeezed from roots -all, without exception, have been known and systematically usedby human beings from time immemorial. And to these natural modifiers of consciousness modernscience has added its quota of synthetics - chloral, for example, and benzedrine, the bromides and thebarbiturates.Most of these modifiers of consciousness cannot now be taken except under doctor's orders, orelse illegally and at considerable risk. For unrestricted use the West has permitted only alcohol andtobacco. All the other chemical Doors in the Wall are labeled Dope, and their unauthorized takers areFiends.We now spend a good deal more on drink and smoke than we spend on education. This, ofcourse, is not surprising. The urge to escape from selfhood and the environment is in almost everyonealmost all the time. The urge to do something for the young is strong only in parents, and in them only forthe few years during which their children go to school. Equally unsurprising is the current attitudetowards drink and smoke. In spite of the growing army of hopeless alcoholics, in spite of the hundredsof thousands of persons annually maimed or killed by drunken drivers, popular comedians still crackjokes about alcohol and its addicts. And in spite of the evidence linking cigarettes with lung cancer,practically everybody regards tobacco smoking as being hardly less normal and natural than eating.From the point of view of the rationalist utilitarian this may seem odd. For the historian, it is exactly whatyou would expect. A firm conviction of the material reality of Hell never prevented medieval Christiansfrom doing what their ambition, lust or covetousness suggested. Lung cancer, traffic accidents and themillions of miserable and misery-creating alcoholics are facts even more certain than was, in Dante'sday, the fact of the Inferno. But all such facts are remote and unsubstantial compared with the near, feltfact of a craving, here and now, for release or sedation, for a drink or a smoke.Ours is the age, among other things, of the automobile and of rocketing population. Alcohol isincompatible with safety on the roads, and its production, like that of tobacco, condemns to virtualsterility many millions of acres of the most fertile soil. The problems raised by alcohol and tobaccocannot, it goes without saying, be solved by prohibition. The universal and ever-present urge to self-transcendence is not to be abolished by slamming the currently popular Doors in the Wall. The onlyreasonable policy is to open other, better doors in the hope of inducing men and women to exchangetheir old bad habits for new and less harmful ones. Some of these other, better doors will be social andtechnological in nature, others religious or psychological, others dietetic, educational, athletic. But theneed for frequent chemical vacations from intolerable selfhood and repulsive surroundings willundoubtedly remain. What is needed is a new drug which will relieve and console our suffering species"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20without doing more harm in the long run than it does good in the short. Such a drug must be potent inminute doses and synthesizable. If it does not possess these qualities, its production, like that of wine,beer, spirits and tobacco will interfere with the raising of indispensable food and fibers. It must be lesstoxic than opium or cocaine, less likely to produce undesirable social consequences than alcohol or thebarbiturates, less inimical to heart and lungs than the tars and nicotine of cigarettes. And, on the positiveside, it should produce changes in consciousness more interesting, more intrinsically valuable than meresedation or dreaminess, delusions of omnipotence or release from inhibition. To most people, mescalinis almost completely innocuous. Unlike alcohol, it does not drive the taker into the kind of uninhibitedaction which results in brawls, crimes of violence and traffic accidents. A man under the influence ofmescalin quietly minds his own business. Moreover, the business he minds is an experience of the mostenlightening kind, which does not have to be paid for (and this is surely important) by a compensatoryhangover. Of the long-range consequences of regular mescalin taking we know very little. The Indianswho consume peyote buttons do not seem to be physically or morally degraded by the habit. However,the available evidence is still scarce and sketchy.* Although obviously superior to cocaine, opium,alcohol and tobacco, mescalin is not yet the ideal drug. Along with the happily transfigured majority ofmescalin takers there is a minority that finds in the drug only hell or purgatory. Moreover, for a drug thatis to be used, like alcohol, for general consumption, its effects last for an inconveniently long time. Butchemistry and physiology are capable nowadays of practically anything. If the psychologists andsociologists will define the ideal, the neurologists and pharmacologists can be relied upon to discover themeans whereby that ideal can be realized or at least (for perhaps this kind of ideal can never, in the verynature of things, be fully realized) more nearly approached than in the wine-bibbing past, the whisky-drinking, marijuana-smoking and barbiturate-swallowing present.The urge to transcend self-conscious selfhood is, as I have said, a principal appetite of the soul.When, for whatever reason, men and women fail to transcend themselves by means of worship, goodworks and spiritual exercises, they are apt to resort to religion's chemical surrogates-alcohol and \"goofpills\" in the modern West, alcohol and opium in the East, hashish in the Mohammedan world, alcoholand marijuana in Central America, alcohol and coca in the Andes, alcohol and the barbiturates in themore up-to-date regions of South America. In Poisons Sacres, Ivresses Divines Philippe de Felice haswritten at length and with a wealth of documentation on the immemorial connection between religion andthe taking of drugs. Here, in summary or in direct quotation, are his conclusions. The employment forreligious purposes of toxic substances is \"extraordinarily widespread.... The practices studied in thisvolume can be observed in every region of the earth, among primitives no less than among those whohave reached a high pitch of civilization. We are therefore dealing not with exceptional facts, whichmight justifiably be overlooked, but with a general and, in the widest sense of the word, a humanphenomenon, the kind of phenomenon which cannot be disregarded by anyone who is trying to discoverwhat religion is, and what are the deep needs which it must satisfy.\"Ideally, everyone should be able to find self-transcendence in some form of pure or applied religion.In practice it seems very unlikely that this hoped for consummation will ever be realized. There are, anddoubtless there always will be, good churchmen and good churchwomen for whom, unfortunately, pietyis not enough. The late G. K. Chesterton, who wrote at least as lyrically of drink as of devotion, mayserve as their eloquent spokesman.The modern churches, with some exceptions among the Protestant denominations, tolerate alcohol;but even the most tolerant have made no attempt to convert the drug to Christianity, or tosacramentalize its use. The pious drinker is forced to take his religion in one compartment, his religion-surrogate in another. And perhaps this is inevitable. Drinking cannot be sacramentalized except in"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21religions which set no store on decorum. The worship of Dionysos or the Celtic god of beer was a loudand disorderly affair. The rites of Christianity are incompatible with even religious drunkenness. Thisdoes no harm to the distillers, but is very bad for Christianity. Countless persons desire self-transcendence and would be glad to find it in church. But, alas, \"the hungry sheep look up and are notfed.\" They take part in rites, they listen to sermons, they repeat prayers; but their thirst remainsunassuaged. Disappointed, they turn to the bottle. For a time at least and in a kind of way, it works.Church may still be attended; but it is no more than the Musical Bank of Butler's Erewhon. God may stillbe acknowledged; but He is God only on the verbal level, only in a strictly Pickwickian sense. Theeffective object of worship is the bottle and the sole religious experience is that state of uninhibited andbelligerent euphoria which follows the ingestion of the third cocktail.We see, then, that Christianity and alcohol do not and cannot mix. Christianity and mescalin seem tobe much more compatible. This has been demonstrated by many tribes of Indians, from Texas to as farnorth as Wisconsin. Among these tribes are to be found groups affiliated with the Native AmericanChurch, a sect whose principal rite is a kind of Early Christian agape, or love feast, where slices ofpeyote take the place of the sacramental bread and wine. These Native Americans regard the cactus asGod's special gift to the Indians, and equate its effects with the workings of the divine Spirit.Professor J. S. Slotkin, one of the very few white men ever to have participated in the rites of aPeyotist congregation, says of his fellow worshipers that they are \"certainly not stupefied or drunk....They never get out of rhythm or fumble their words, as a drunken or stupefied man would do.... Theyare all quiet, courteous and considerate of one another. I have never been in any white man's house ofworship where there is either so much religious feeling or decorum.\" And what, we may ask, are thesedevout and well-behaved Peyotists experiencing? Not the mild sense of virtue which sustains theaverage Sunday churchgoer through ninety minutes of boredom. Not even those high feelings, inspiredby thoughts of the Creator and the Redeemer, the Judge and the Comforter, which animate the pious.For these Native Americans, religious experience is something more direct and illuminating, morespontaneous, less the homemade product of the superficial, self-conscious mind. Sometimes (accordingto the reports collected by Dr. Slotkin) they see visions, which may be of Christ Himself. Sometimesthey hear the voice of the Great Spirit. Sometimes they become aware of the presence of God and ofthose personal shortcomings which must be corrected if they are to do His will. The practicalconsequences of these chemical openings of doors into the Other World seem to be wholly good. Dr.Slotkin reports that habitual Peyotists are on the whole more industrious, more temperate (many of themabstain altogether from alcohol), more Peaceable than non-Peyotists. A tree with such satisfactory fruitscannot be condemned out of hand as evil.In sacramentalizing the use of peyote, the Indians of the Native American Church have donesomething which is at once psychologically sound and historically respectable. In the early centuries ofChristianity many pagan rites and festivals were baptized, so to say, and made to serve the purposes ofthe Church. These jollifications were not particularly edifying; but they assuaged a certain psychologicalhunger and, instead of trying to suppress them, the earlier missionaries had the sense to accept them forwhat they were, soul-satisfying expressions of fundamental urges, and to incorporate them into the fabricof the new religion. What the Native Americans have done is essentially similar. They have taken apagan custom (a custom, incidentally, far more elevating and enlightening than most of the rather brutishcarousals and mummeries adopted from European paganism) and given it a Christian significance.Though but recently introduced into the northern United States, peyote-eating and the religionbased upon it have become important symbols of the red man's right to spiritual independence. SomeIndians have reacted to white supremacy by becoming Americanized, others by retreating into"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22traditional Indianism. But some have tried to make the best of both worlds, indeed of all the worlds -thebest of Indianism, the best of Christianity, and the best of those Other Worlds of transcendentalexperience, where the soul knows itself as unconditioned and of like nature with the divine. Hence theNative American Church. In it two great appetites of the soul - the urge to independence and self-determination and the urge to self-transcendence - were fused with, and interpreted in the light of, athird - the urge to worship, to justify the ways of God to man, to explain the universe by means of acoherent theology.Lo, the poor Indian, whose untutored mindClothes him in front, but leaves him bare behind.But actually it is we, the rich and highly educated whites, who have left ourselves bare behind. We coverour anterior nakedness with some philosophy-Christian, Marxian, Freudo-Physicalist-but abaft weremain uncovered, at the mercy of all the winds of circumstance. The poor Indian, on the other hand,has had the wit to protect his rear by supplementing the fig leaf of a theology with the breechcloth oftranscendental experience.I am not so foolish as to equate what happens under the influence of mescalin or of any other drug,prepared or in the future preparable, with the realization of the end and ultimate purpose of human life:Enlightenment, the Beatific Vision. All I am suggesting is that the mescalin experience is what Catholictheologians call \"a gratuitous grace,\" not necessary to salvation but potentially helpful and to be acceptedthankfully, if made available. To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception, to be shown for a fewtimeless hours the outer and the inner world, not as they appear to an animal obsessed with survival orto a human being obsessed with words and notions, but as they are apprehended, directly andunconditionally, by Mind at Large - this is an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especiallyto the intellectual. For the intellectual is by definition the man for whom, in Goethe's phrase, \"the word isessentially fruitful.\" He is the man who feels that \"what we perceive by the eye is foreign to us as suchand need not impress us deeply.\" And yet, though himself an intellectual and one of the supreme mastersof language, Goethe did not always agree with his own evaluation of the word. \"We talk,\" he wrote inmiddle life, \"far too much. We should talk less and draw more. I personally should like to renouncespeech altogether and, like organic Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches. That figtree, this little snake, the cocoon on my window sill quietly awaiting its future - all these are momentoussignatures. A person able to decipher their meaning properly would soon be able to dispense with thewritten or the spoken word altogether. The more I think of it, there is something futile, mediocre, even (Iam tempted to say) foppish about speech. By contrast, how the gravity of Nature and her silence startleyou, when you stand face to face with her, undistracted, before a barren ridge or in the desolation of theancient hills.\" We can never dispense with language and the other symbol systems; for it is by means ofthem, and only by their means, that we have raised ourselves above the brutes, to the level of humanbeings. But we can easily become the victims as well as the beneficiaries of these systems. We mustlearn how to handle words effectively; but at the same time we must preserve and, if necessary, intensifyour ability to look at the world directly and not through that half opaque medium of concepts, whichdistorts every given fact into the all too familiar likeness of some generic label or explanatoryabstraction.Literary or scientific, liberal or specialist, all our education is predominantly verbal and thereforefails to accomplish what it is supposed to do. Instead of transforming children into fully developedadults, it turns out students of the natural sciences who are completely unaware of Nature as the primary"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23fact of experience, it inflicts upon the world students of the humanities who know nothing of humanity,their own or anyone else's.Gestalt psychologists, such as Samuel Renshaw, have devised methods for widening the range andincreasing the acuity of human perceptions. But do our educators apply them? The answer is, No.Teachers in every field of psyche-physical skill, from seeing to tennis, from tightrope walking toprayer, have discovered, by trial and error, the conditions of optimum functioning within their specialfields. But have any of the great Foundations financed a project for co-ordinating these empiricalfindings into a general theory and practice of heightened creativeness? Again, so far as I am aware, theanswer is, No.All sorts of cultists and queer fish teach all kinds of techniques for achieving health, contentment,peace of mind; and for many of their hearers many of these techniques are demonstrably effective. Butdo we see respectable psychologists, philosophers and clergymen boldly descending into those odd andsometimes malodorous wells, at the bottom of which poor Truth is so often condemned to sit? Yet oncemore the answer is, No.And now look at the history of mescalin research. Seventy years ago men of first-rate abilitydescribed the transcendental experiences which come to those who, in good health, under properconditions and in the right spirit, take the drug. How many philosophers, how many theologians, howmany professional educators have had the curiosity to open this Door in the Wall? The answer, for allpractical purposes, is, None.In a world where education is predominantly verbal, highly educated people find it all but impossibleto pay serious attention to anything but words and notions. There is always money for, there are alwaysdoctorates in, the learned foolery of research into what, for scholars, is the all-important problem: Whoinfluenced whom to say what when? Even in this age of technology the verbal humanities are honored.The non-verbal humanities, the arts of being directly aware of the given facts of our existence, ale almostcompletely ignored. A catalogue, a bibliography, a definitive edition of a third-rate versier's ipsissimaverba, a stupendous index to end all indexes - any genuinely Alexandrian project is sure of approval andfinancial support: But when it comes to finding out how you and I, our children and grandchildren, maybecome more perceptive, more intensely aware of inward and outward reality, more open to the Spirit,less apt, by psychological malpractices, to make ourselves physically ill, and more capable of controllingour own autonomic nervous system - when it comes to any form of non-verbal education morefundamental (and more likely to be of some practical use) than Swedish drill, no really respectableperson in any really respectable university or church will do anything about it. Verbalists are suspiciousof the non-verbal; rationalists fear the given, non-rational fact; intellectuals feel that \"what we perceiveby the eye (or in any other way) is foreign to us as such and need not impress us deeply.\" Besides, thismatter of education in the non-verbal humanities will not fit into any of the established pigeonholes. It isnot religion, not neurology, not gymnastics, not morality or civics, not even experimental psychology.This being so the subject is, for academic and ecclesiastical purposes, non-existent and may safely beignored altogether or left, with a Patronizing smile, to those whom the Pharisees of verbal orthodoxy callcranks, quacks, charlatans and unqualified amateurs. \"I have always found,\" Blake wrote rather bitterly,\"that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves as the only wise. This they do with a confidentinsolence sprouting from systematic reasoning.\" Systematic reasoning is something we could not, as aspecies or as individuals, possibly do without. But neither, if we are to remain sane, can we possibly dowithout direct perception, the more unsystematic the better, of the inner and outer worlds into which wehave been born. This given reality is an infinite which passes all understanding and yet admits of beingdirectly and in some sort totally apprehended. It is a transcendence belonging to another order than the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24human, and yet it may be present to us as a felt immanence, an experienced participation. To beenlightened is to be aware, always, of total reality in its immanent otherness - to be aware of it and yetto remain in a condition to survive as an animal, to think and feel as a human being, to resort wheneverexpedient to systematic reasoning. Our goal is to discover that we have always been where we ought tobe. Unhappily we make the task exceedingly difficult for ourselves. Meanwhile, however, there aregratuitous graces in the form of partial and fleeting realizations. Under a more realistic, a less exclusivelyverbal system of education than ours, every Angel (in Blake's sense of that word) would be permitted asa sabbatical treat, would be urged and even, if necessary, compelled to take an occasional trip throughsome chemical Door in the Wall into the world of transcendental experience. If it terrified him, it wouldbe unfortunate but probably salutary. If it brought him a brief but timeless illumination, so much thebetter. In either case the Angel might lose a little of the confident insolence sprouting from systematicreasoning and the consciousness of having read all the books.Near the end of his life Aquinas experienced Infused Contemplation. Thereafter he refused to goback to work on his unfinished book. Compared with this, everything he had read and argued aboutand written - Aristotle and the Sentences, the Questions, the Propositions, the majestic Summas-was nobetter than chaff or straw, For most intellectuals such a sit-down strike would be inadvisable, evenmorally wrong. But the Angelic Doctor had done more systematic reasoning than any twelve ordinaryAngels, and was already ripe for death. He had earned the right, in those last months of his mortality, toturn away from merely symbolic straw and chaff to the bread of actual and substantial Fact. For Angelsof a lower order and with better prospects of longevity, there must be a return to the straw. But the manwho comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out.He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging hisignorance yet better equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of systematic reasoningto the unfathomable Mystery which it tries, forever vainly, to comprehend."}]
